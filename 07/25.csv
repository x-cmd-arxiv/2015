relation describes the transitions induced by bistochastic maps in the presence
of additional auxiliary systems which may become correlated in the process. We

nights covering about 0.5 and 4 rotation cycles in the $R$ and $I$ filters,
respectively. We also obtained simultaneous intensity curves by means of
differential photometry. The typical precision of the data is $\pm$0.46\%

  Results: Strong and variable linear polarization is detected in the $R$ and
$I$ filters, with values of maximum polarization ($p^{*}$ = 1.30$\pm$0.35 \%)
similar for both bands. The intensity and the polarimetric curves present a
sinusoid-like pattern with a periodicity of $\sim$1.98 h, which we ascribe to

the peaks of the intensity and polarimetric curves occur with a phase
difference of 0.18$\pm$0.01, and that the maximum of the linear polarization
happens nearly half a period (0.59$\pm$0.03) after the radio pulse. We
discussed different scenarios to account for the observed properties of the

investigates the interplay between coherent and dissipative processes. Recent
experiments have revealed a first glimpse into the emergence of a rich
non-equilibrium behavior stemming from the competition of laser excitation,
strong interactions and radiative decay of Rydberg atoms. The aim of the
present theoretical work is to show that local incoherent loss and gain of
atoms can in fact be the source of interesting out-of-equilibrium dynamics.
This perspective opens new paths for the exploration of non-equilibrium
critical phenomena and, more generally, phase transitions, some of which so far
have been rather difficult to study. To demonstrate the richness of the
encountered dynamical behavior we consider here three examples. The first two
feature local atom loss and gain together with an incoherent excitation of
Rydberg states. In this setting either a continuous or a discontinuous phase
transition emerges with the former being reminiscent of genuine non-equilibrium
transitions of stochastic processes with multiple absorbing states. The third
example considers the regime of coherent laser excitation. Here the many-body
dynamics is dominated by an equilibrium transition of the ""model A""
universality class.

depletion interaction between obstacles in a gas flow of interacting Brownian
particles is presented. When increasing bath fraction exceeds half-filling, the
wake-mediated interaction between obstacles switches from effective attraction
to repulsion or vice-versa, depending on the mutual alignment of obstacles with
respect to the gas flow. It is shown that for an ensemble of small and widely
separated obstacles the dissipative interaction takes the form of induced
dipole-dipole interaction governed by an anisotropic screened Coulomb-like
potential. This allows one to give a qualitative picture of the interaction
between obstacles and explain switching effect as a result of changes of
anisotropy direction. The non-linear blockade effect is shown to be essential
near closely located obstacles, that manifests itself in additional screening
of the gas flow and generation of a pronounced step-like profile of gas density
distribution. It is established that behavior of the magnitude of dissipative
effective interaction is, generally, non-monotonic in relation to both the bath
fraction and the external driving field. It has characteristic peaks
corresponding to the situation when the common density ""coat"" formed around the
obstacles is most pronounced. The possibility of the dissipative pairing effect
is briefly discussed. All the results are obtained within the classical

Christen and Selkow in 1979 and Yegnanarayanan in 2001. Let $ a,b \in \{
\omega, \chi, \Gamma, \alpha, \psi \} $ where $ \omega $ is the clique number,
$ \chi $ is the chromatic number, $ \Gamma $ is the Grundy number, $ \alpha $
is the achromatic number and $ \psi $ is the pseudoachromatic number. A graph $
G $ is \emph{$ ab $-perfect}, if for every induced subgraph $ H $ of $G$, $
a(H)$ equals $b(H) $. In this paper, we characterize the $ab$-perfect graphs
when $a=\omega$ and $b=\psi$.

is derived from the cubic approximation of the variation $\delta

$s$ along $\hat{z}$. We show that modes $\hat{z}_0$ corresponding to low-lying
minima of $b(\hat{z})$ lead to transitions over energy barriers in the glass,
and are therefore associated with highly asymmetric variations $\delta
U_{\hat{z}}(s)$ with $s$. We further demonstrate how a heuristic search for
local minima of $b(\hat{z})$ can a-priori detect the locus and geometry of
imminent plastic instabilities with remarkable accuracy, at strains as large as
$\gamma_c-\gamma \sim 10^{-2}$ away from the instability strain $\gamma_c$,

be effectively carried out by the investigation of the landscape of

homogenization for linear elliptic equations in divergence form. Unlike
previous works on the topic, our method does not use concentration inequalities

space) and relies instead on a higher ($C^{k}$, $k \geq 1$) regularity theory
for solutions of the heterogeneous equation, which is valid on length scales
larger than a certain specified mesoscopic scale. This regularity theory, which
is of independent interest, allows us to, in effect, localize the dependence of
the solutions on the coefficients and thereby accelerate the rate of
convergence of the expected energy of the cell problem by a bootstrap argument.
The fluctuations of the energy are then tightly controlled using subadditivity.
The convergence of the energy gives control of the scaling of the spatial
averages of gradients and fluxes (that is, it quantifies the weak convergence
of these quantities) which yields, by a new ""multiscale"" Poincar\'e inequality,
quantitative estimates on the sublinearity of the corrector.

iterative Boltzmann inversion strategy can be used to determine the isotropic
pair potential that reproduces the radial distribution function of a fluid of
amorphous clusters with prescribed size. The inverse designed pair potential of
this ""ideal"" cluster fluid, with its broad attractive well and narrow repulsive
barrier at larger separations, is qualitatively different from the so-called
SALR form most commonly associated with equilibrium cluster formation in
colloids, which features short-range attractive (SA) and long-range repulsive
(LR) contributions. These differences reflect alternative mechanisms for
promoting cluster formation with an isotropic pair potential, and they in turn
produce structured fluids with qualitatively different static and dynamic
properties. Specifically, equilibrium simulations show that the amorphous
clusters resulting from the inverse designed potentials display more uniformity
in size and shape, and they also show greater spatial and temporal resolution
than those resulting from SALR interactions.

  Compact combinatorial generation algorithms are given for several families of

type inference and normal order reduction algorithms. We describe a
Prolog-based combined lambda term generator and type-inferrer for closed
well-typed terms of a given size, in de Bruijn notation.
  We introduce a compressed de Bruijn representation of lambda terms and define
its bijections to standard representations. Our compressed terms facilitate
derivation of size-proportionate ranking and unranking algorithms of lambda
terms and their inferred simple types.
  The S and K combinator expressions form a well-known Turing-complete subset
of the lambda calculus. We specify evaluation, type inference and combinatorial
generation algorithms for SK-combinator trees. In the process, we unravel
properties shedding new light on interesting aspects of their structure and
distribution.
  A uniform representation, as binary trees with empty leaves, is given to
expressions built with Rosser's X-combinator, natural numbers, lambda terms and

question about binary search trees (BST). It postulates the existence of an
asymptotically optimal online BST, i.e. one that is constant factor competitive
with any BST on any input access sequence. The two main candidates for dynamic
optimality in the literature are splay trees [Sleator and Tarjan, 1985], and
Greedy [Lucas, 1988; Munro, 2000; Demaine et al. 2009] [..]
  Dynamic optimality is trivial for almost all sequences: the optimum access
cost of most length-n sequences is Theta(n log n), achievable by any balanced
BST. Thus, the obvious missing step towards the conjecture is an understanding
of the ""easy"" access sequences. [..] The difficulty of proving dynamic
optimality is witnessed by highly restricted special cases that remain
unresolved; one prominent example is the traversal conjecture [Sleator and
Tarjan, 1985], which states that preorder sequences (whose optimum is linear)
are linear-time accessed by splay trees; no online BST is known to satisfy this
conjecture.
  In this paper, we prove two different relaxations of the traversal conjecture
for Greedy: (i) Greedy is almost linear for preorder traversal, (ii) if a
linear-time preprocessing is allowed, Greedy is in fact linear. These
statements are corollaries of our more general results that express the
complexity of access sequences in terms of a pattern avoidance parameter k.
[..] To our knowledge, these are the first upper bounds for Greedy that are not
known to hold for any other online BST. To obtain these results we identify an
input-revealing property of Greedy. Informally, this means that the execution
log partially reveals the structure of the access sequence. This property
facilitates the use of rich technical tools from forbidden submatrix theory.

eviction to trigger the Rowhammer bug with only regular memory accesses. This

is shown that solid Helium-4 in a contact with superfluid reservoir can develop
a bistability with respect to the syringe fraction, with the threshold for the
bias by chemical potential determined by a typical free length of dislocations
with superfluid core. The main implications of this effect are: hysteresis and
strongly non-linear dynamical behavior leading to growth, proliferation and
possibly exiting from a crystal of superclimbing dislocations. Three major
channels for such dynamics are identified: i) injection and inflation of the
prismatic loops from the boundary; ii) Bardeed-Herring generation of the loops

that the current experiments are likely to be well in this regime. Several
testable predictions for the time and the bias dependencies of the dynamics are

initio laser theory (SALT), which treats lasing and amplification in a unified
manner as a non-unitary scattering problem described by a non-linear scattering
matrix. Within the semiclassical version of the theory the laser line has zero
width as the lasing mode corresponds to the existence of an eigenvector of the
S-matrix with diverging eigenvalue due to the occurrence of a pole of the
scattering matrix on the real axis. In this approach the system is infinite
from the outset and no distinction is made between cavity modes and modes of
the universe; lasing modes exist both in the cavity and in the external region
as solutions satisfying Sommerfeld radiation boundary conditions. We discuss
how such solutions can be obtained by a limiting procedure in a finite box with
damping according to the limiting absorption principle. When the
electromagnetic and matter fields are treated as operators, quantum
fluctuations enter the relevant correlation functions and a finite linewidth is
obtained, via a generalization of SALT to include noise (N-SALT). N-SALT leads
to an analytic formula for the linewidth that is more general than all previous
corrected versions of the Schawlow-Townes formula, and can be evaluated simply
from knowledge of the semiclassical SALT modes. We derive a simpler version of
this formula which emphasizes that the noise is dominated by the fluctuations
in the polarization of the gain medium and is controlled by the rate of
spontaneous emission.

during the prompt phase of GRBs. This component, often associated with the GRB
jet's photosphere, is usually subdominant compared to a much stronger
non-thermal one. The prompt emission of Fermi GRB 131014A provides a unique
opportunity to study this thermal-like component. Indeed, the thermal emission
in GRB 131014A is much more intense than in other GRBs and a pure thermal
episode is observed during the initial 0.16 s. The thermal-like component cools
monotonically during the first second while the non-thermal emission kicks off.
The intensity of the non-thermal component progressively increases until being
energetically dominant at late time. This is a perfect scenario to disentangle
the thermal component from the non-thermal one. A low-energy spectral index of
+0.6 better fit the thermal component than the typical index value +1
corresponding to a pure Planck function. The non-thermal component is
adequately fitted with a Band function whose low and high energy power law
indices are ~-0.7 and <~-3, respectively; this is also statistically equivalent
to a cutoff power law with a ~-0.7 index. This is in agreement with our
previous results. Finally, a strong correlation is observed between the
time-resolved luminosity of the non-thermal component, L$_i^{nTh}$, and its
corresponding rest frame spectral peak energy, E$_{peak,i}^{rest,nTh}$, with a
slope similar to the one reported in our previous articles. Assuming this
relation to be universal for all GRBs we estimate a redshift of ~1.55 for GRB
131014A that is a typical value for long GRBs. These observational results are
consistent with the models in which the non-thermal emission is produced well
above the GRB jet photosphere but they may also be compatible with other
scenarios (e.g., dissipative photosphere) that are not discussed in this
article.

some mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priors
naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned

provide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GP

lowest conduction subband at room temperature, resulting in near-complete
absence of DP relaxation. This allows observation of spin-sensitive effects in
the magnetoresistance. Under infrared illumination, electrons are photoexcited
to higher subbands and the DP spin relaxation mechanism is revived, leading to
a three-fold decrease in the spin relaxation length. Consequently, the spin
sensitive effects are no longer observable under illumination. This phenomenon
may have applications in spintronic room-temperature infrared photodetection.

twisted due to apparant superluminal motion. The rapidly increasing orbital

numerical method to construct the Truncated Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (TGGE)
for the spin-1/2 isotropic Heisenberg ($XXX$) chain. The key idea is to sample
the Hilbert space of the model with the appropriate GGE probability measure.
The method can be extended to other integrable systems, such as the
Lieb-Liniger model. We benchmark the approach focusing on GGE expectation
values of several local observables. As finite-size effects decay exponentially
with system size, moderately large chains are sufficient to extract
thermodynamic quantities. The Monte Carlo results are in agreement with both
the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) and the Quantum Transfer Matrix approach
(QTM). Remarkably, it is possible to extract in a simple way the steady-state
Bethe-Gaudin-Takahashi (BGT) roots distributions, which encode complete
information about the GGE expectation values in the thermodynamic limit.
Finally, it is straightforward to simulate extensions of the GGE, in which,
besides the local integral of motion (local charges), one includes arbitrary
functions of the BGT roots. As an example, we include in the GGE the first
non-trivial quasi-local integral of motion.

of these hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four orders of
magnitude in halo mass ($10.7<log_{10}(M_{200}/[h^{-1}M_\odot])<15$) and a
large range of separations ($-1<log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}Mpc])< 2$). We focus on two
classes of alignments: the orientations of galaxies with respect to either the
directions to, or the orientations of, surrounding galaxies. We find that the
strength of the alignment is a strongly decreasing function of the distance
between galaxies. The orientation-direction alignment can remain significant up
to ~100 Mpc, for galaxies hosted by the most massive haloes in our simulations.
Galaxies hosted by more massive subhaloes show stronger alignment. At a fixed
halo mass, more aspherical or prolate galaxies exhibit stronger alignments. The
spatial distribution of satellites is anisotropic and significantly aligned
with the major axis of the main host halo. The major axis of satellite
galaxies, when all stars are considered, are preferentially aligned towards the
centre of the main host halo. The predicted projected direction-orientation
alignment, $\epsilon_{g+}(r_{p})$, is in broad agreement with recent
observations when only stars within the typical observable extent of a galaxy
are used to define galaxy orientations. We find that the
orientation-orientation alignment is weaker than the orientation-direction
alignment on all scales. Overall, the strength of galaxy alignments depends
strongly on the subset of stars that are used to measure the orientations of
galaxies and it is always weaker than the alignment of the dark matter haloes.
Thus, alignment models that use halo orientation as a direct proxy for galaxy
orientation will overestimate the impact of intrinsic alignments on weak
lensing analyses.

$h_n/\sigma_n=(n-1)\pi$. We show how it reduces to our previous result as
$n\rightarrow 1$, and explicitly check its validity for free scalars and
fermions. With this new relation, we show that as $n\rightarrow 0$, $\sigma_n$
yields the coefficient of the thermal entropy, $c_S$. We also reveal a
surprising duality relating the corner coefficients of the scalar and the
fermion. Further, we use our result to predict $\sigma_n$ for holographic CFTs
dual to four-dimensional Einstein gravity. Our findings generalize to other

disks is perturbed in a similar manner to the solid, planetesimal dominated

conditions for planet formation in circumbinary protoplanetary disks. We
present a number of hydrodynamical simulations that explore the response of gas
disks around two observed binary systems: Kepler-16 and Kepler-34. We probe the
importance of disk viscosity, aspect-ratio, inner boundary condition, initial
surface density gradient, and self-gravity on the dynamical evolution of the
disk, as well as its quasi steady-state profile. We find there is a strong
influence of binary type on the mean disk eccentricity, e_d, leading to e_d =
0.02 - 0.08 for Kepler-16 and e_d = 0.10 - 0.15 in Kepler-34. The value of
alpha-viscosity has little influence on the disk, but we find a strong increase
in mean disk eccentricity with increasing aspect-ratio due to wave propagation
effects. The choice of inner boundary condition only has a small effect on the
surface density and eccentricity of the disk. Our primary finding is that
including disk self-gravity has little impact on the evolution or final state
of the disk for disks with masses less than 12.5 times that of the minimum-mass
solar nebula. This finding contrasts with the results of self-gravity relevance
in circumprimary disks, where its inclusion is found to be an important factor

non-perturbative homological relations, introduced in our companion paper
arXiv:1506.06764, which encode the interplay between the self-dual 3-form flux
on the M5-brane, the background 4-form flux and certain fibral curves. The
latter are wrapped by time-like M2-branes representing matter insertions in the

detect the presence of geometrically massive $U(1)$s which are responsible for
`hidden' selection rules. We discuss how for non-generic embeddings the
M5-instanton can probe `locally massless' $U(1)$ symmetries if the rank of its
Mordell-Weil group is enhanced compared to that of the bulk. As a
phenomenological off-spring we propose a new type of non-perturbative

reproduce existing observations of the CGM. In contrast, simulation that does
not produce a realistic galaxy has the predicted CGM in better agreement with
observations. This illustrates that properties of galaxies and properties of
their CGM provide strong ${\it complementary}$ constraints on the processes
governing galaxy formation. Our simulations predict that column density
profiles of ions are well described by an exponential function of projected
distance $d$: $N \propto e^{-d/h_s}$. Simulations thus indicate that the sharp
drop in absorber detections at larger distances in observations does not
correspond to a ""boundary"" of an ion, but reflects the underlying steep
exponential column density profile. Furthermore, we find that ionization energy
of ions is tightly correlated with the scale height $h_s$: $h_s \propto E_{\rm
ion}^{0.74}$. At $z \approx 0$, warm gas traced by low-ionization species
(e.g., Mg II and C IV) has $ h_s \approx 0.03-0.07 R_{\rm vir}$, while higher

Recently, electroweak-scale pseudoscalars have received increased attention in
explaining the diffuse gamma-ray excess from the Galactic Centre. Elusive due
to absence of direct couplings to gauge bosons, these particles receive only
weak constraints from direct searches at LEP or searches performed during the
first LHC runs. We investigate the LHC's sensitivity in observing a CP-odd
scalar in di-top associated production in the mass range $20 \leq m_A \leq 100$
GeV using jet substructure based reconstruction techniques. We parametrise the
scalar's interactions using a simplified model approach and relate the obtained
upper limits to couplings within type-I and type-II 2HDMs as well as the NMSSM.
We find that in di-top-associated production, experiments at the LHC can set
tight limits on CP-odd scalars that fit the Galactic Centre excess. However,
direct sensitivity to light CP-odd scalars from the NMSSM proves to remain
challenging.

spatiotemporal profile creates electron-positron pairs via multidimensional
quantum tunneling. Our treatment is based on the trace formula for the QED
effective action, whose imaginary part is represented by a sum over complex
worldline solutions. The worldlines are multiperiodic, and the periods of
motion collectively depend on the strength of spatial and temporal
inhomogeneity. We argue that the classical action that leads to the correct
tunneling amplitude must take into account both the full period, $\tilde{T}$
and the first fundamental period, $T_1$. In view of this argument we
investigate pair production in an exponentially damped sinusoidal field and
find that the initial momenta for multiperiodic trajectories lie on parabolic
curves, such that on each curve the ratio $\tilde{T}/T_1$ stays uniform.
Evaluation of the tunneling amplitude using these trajectories shows that
vacuum decay rate is reduced by an order of magnitude, with respect to the
purely time-dependent case, due to the presence of magnetic field.

that a direct analysis based on It\^o's formula provides stability conditions

about 0.45 Msun of composite dust grains consisting of ~0.4 Msun of silicates
and ~ 0.05 Msun of amorphous carbon after day ~8500. The proposed scenario
challenges previous claims that dust in SN ejecta is predominantly carbon, and
that it grew from an initial mass of ~1e-3 Msun, to over 0.5 Msun by cold
accretion. It alleviates several problems with previous interpretations of the
data: (1) it reconciles the abundances of silicon, magnesium, and carbon with
the upper limits imposed by nucleosynthesis calculations; (2) it eliminates the
requirement that most of the dust observed around day 9000 grew by cold
accretion onto the1e-3 Msun of dust previously inferred for days 615 and 775
after the explosion; and (3) establishes the dominance of silicate over carbon
dust in the SN ejecta. At early epochs, the IR luminosity of the dust is
powered by the radioactive decay of 56Co, and at late times by at least
(1.3-1.6)e-4 Msun 44Ti. Even if only a fraction greater than ~10% of the
silicate dust survives the injection into the ISM, the observations firmly
establish the role of core collapse SNe as the major source of thermally
condensed silicate dust in the universe.

isotropic turbulence in the absence of gravity using direct numerical
simulation (DNS). Here, in Part II, we introduce gravity and study its effect
over a wide range of flow Reynolds numbers, Froude numbers, and particle Stokes
numbers. We see that gravity causes particles to sample the flow more uniformly
and reduces the time particles can spend interacting with the underlying
turbulence. We also find that gravity tends to increase inertial particle
accelerations, and we introduce a model to explain that effect.
  We then analyze the particle relative velocities and radial distribution
functions (RDFs), which are generally seen to be independent of Reynolds number
for low and moderate Kolmogorov-scale Stokes numbers $St$. We see that gravity
causes particle relative velocities to decrease, and that the relative
velocities have higher scaling exponents with gravity. We observe that gravity
has a non-trivial effect on clustering, acting to decrease clustering at low
$St$ and to increase clustering at high $St$. By considering the effect of
gravity on the clustering mechanisms described in the theory of Zaichik &
Alipchenkov (New J. Phys., 11:103018, 2009), we provide an explanation for this
non-trivial effect of gravity. We also show that when the effects of gravity
are accounted for in the theory of Zaichik & Alipchenkov, the results compare
favorably with DNS. The relative velocities and RDFs exhibit considerable
anisotropy at small separations, and this anisotropy is quantified using
spherical harmonic functions. We use the relative velocities and the RDFs to
compute the particle collision kernels, and find that the collision kernel
remains as it was for the case without gravity, namely nearly independent of
Reynolds number for low and moderate $St$.

the resulting parameter uncertainty, but typically at a high computational
cost. This work introduces a multiscale decomposition that exploits conditional
independence across scales, when present in certain classes of inverse
problems, to decouple Bayesian inference into two stages: (1) a computationally
tractable coarse-scale inference problem; and (2) a mapping of the
low-dimensional coarse-scale posterior distribution into the original
high-dimensional parameter space. This decomposition relies on a
characterization of the non-Gaussian joint distribution of coarse- and
fine-scale quantities via optimal transport maps. We demonstrate our approach
on a sequence of inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, using the
multiscale finite element method to discretize the steady state pressure
equation. We compare the multiscale strategy with full-dimensional Markov chain

particles and inertial particle pairs in direct numerical simulations of
homogeneous isotropic turbulence in the absence of gravity. The effect of the
Taylor microscale Reynolds number $R_\lambda$ on the particle statistics is
examined over the largest range to date (from $R_\lambda = 88-597$). We first
explore the effect of preferential sampling on the single-particle statistics,
and use our understanding of preferential sampling to provide a physical
explanation for many of the trends in the particle velocity gradients, kinetic
energies, and accelerations at low $St$. As $St$ increases, inertial filtering
effects become more important, causing the particle kinetic energies and
accelerations to decrease.
  We then consider particle-pair statistics, and focus our attention on the
relative velocities and radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the particles.
The relative velocity statistics indicate that preferential-sampling effects
are important for $St \lesssim 0.1$ and that path-history/non-local effects
become increasingly important for $St \gtrsim 0.2$. The lower-order relative
velocity statistics are only weakly sensitive to changes in Reynolds number at
low $St$. We find that the RDFs peak near $St$ of order unity, that they
exhibit power-law scaling for low and intermediate $St$, and that they are
largely independent of Reynolds number for low and intermediate $St$. We also
observe that at large $St$, changes in the RDF are related to changes the
scaling exponents of the relative velocity variances. The particle collision
kernel is found to be largely insensitive to the flow Reynolds number,
suggesting that relatively low-Reynolds-number simulations may be able to
capture much of the relevant physics of droplet collisions and growth in the
adiabatic cores of atmospheric clouds.

Adsorbed gas molecules alter the electron density at metal surfaces3, changing
the energy of the surface plasmon resonance4,5. All-optical methods using light
as the excitation source can identify, in situ, gas-metal interactions in an
ensemble of metal nanoparticles by measuring energy shifts of either stationary
surface plasmon resonances over an entire particle, or delocalized symmetric
modes on multiple regions in a particle6-8. Such methods preclude the
characterization of facet-dependent gas adsorption for individual

environmental scanning-transmission electron microscope, we show that
localized, stationary surface plasmons on individual facets of triangular
crystalline Au nanoparticles in vacuum and in gaseous environments can be
excited using a nanometer size electron probe. We then show that, by exploiting
this localized spatial resolution, selective gas adsorption on specific sets of
facets can be characterized. We anticipate that this method can be extended to
quantify the concentration of adsorbed molecules, derive the binding energy for
specific facets for certain gas species, and design facet-controlled
nanoparticles to achieve specific gas adsorption properties.

flow with constant external torque applied to the stirrers. Two experiments
were performed at nearly equal Reynolds numbers, in geometrically similar
experimental setups. Air was utilized in one of them and water in the other.
With air, it was found that the probability density function of power
fluctuations is strongly asymmetric, while with water, it is nearly Gaussian.
This suggests that the outcome of a big change of the fluid density in the
flow-stirrer interaction is not simply a change in the amplitude of stirrers'
response. In the case of water, with a density roughly 830 times greater than
air density, the coupling between the flow and the stirrers is stronger, so
that they follow more closely the fluctuations of the average rotation of the
nearby flow. When the fluid is air, the coupling is much weaker. The result is
not just a smaller response of the stirrers to the torque exerted by the flow;
the PDF of the injected power becomes strongly asymmetric and its spectrum
acquires a broad region that scales as $f^{-2}$. Thus, the asymmetry of the
probability density functions of torque or angular speed could be related to
the inability of the stirrers to respond to flow stresses. This happens, for
instance, when the torque exerted by the flow is weak, due to small fluid
density, or when the stirrers' moment of inertia is large. Moreover, a
correlation analysis reveals that the features of the energy transfer dynamics
with water are qualitatively and quantitatively different to what is observed
with air as working fluid.

size and chromosome replication may be simultaneously regulated by the
long-standing initiator accumulation strategy. The strategy proposes that
initiators are produced in proportion to the volume increase and is accumulated
at each origin of replication, and chromosome replication is initiated when a
critical amount per origin has accumulated. We show that this model maps to the
incremental model of size control, which was previously shown to reproduce
experimentally observed correlations between various events in the cell cycle

regulation of the timing of initiation and the number of origins consistent

that variation. However, policy adjustments will sometimes be costly, which

management question -- how to manage a stochastically varying population using
annually varying quotas in order to maximize profit -- to examine how costs of
policy adjustment change optimal management recommendations. Costs of policy
adjustment (here changes in fishing quotas through time) could take different
forms. For example, these costs may respond to the size of the change being
implemented, or there could be a fixed cost any time a quota change is made. We
show how different forms of policy costs have contrasting implications for
optimal policies. Though it is frequently assumed that costs to adjusting
policies will dampen variation in the policy, we show that certain cost
structures can actually increase variation through time. We further show that
failing to account for adjustment costs has a consistently worse economic
impact than would assuming these costs are present when they are not.

where there is little cool gas to make the SNe ejecta radiate at lower

observation of an S0 galaxy NGC5866, which is relatively rich in molecular gas
as an S0 galaxy and shows significant evidence of cool-hot gas interaction. By
jointly analyzing the Suzaku and an archival Chandra data, we measure the Fe/O
abundance ratio to be $7.63_{-5.52}^{+7.28}$ relative to solar values. This
abundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among
the highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies. NGC5866 also simultaneously has
the highest Fe/O abundance ratio and molecular gas mass among a small sample of
gas-poor early-type galaxies. An estimation of the Fe budget indicates that
NGC5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction, but far from the total
amount of Fe injected by Type Ia SNe. We also find that the hot gas temperature
increases from inner to outer halos, with the inner halo has a temperature of
~0.25keV, clearly lower than that expected from Type Ia SNe heating. This low
temperature could be most naturally explained by additional cooling processes
related to the cool-hot gas interaction as being indicated by the existence of
many extraplanar dusty filaments. Our results indicate that the large cool gas
content and the presence of cool-hot gas interaction in the inner region of
NGC5866 have significantly reduced the specific energy of the SN ejecta and so
the velocity of galactic outflow. The galaxy could thus preserve a considerable
fraction of metal-enriched feedback material from being blown out.

our approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs),
constructed using Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS and Herschel/SPIRE photometry, of 380
radio sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. From the fitted SEDs,
we determine the relative AGN and star-forming contributions to their infrared
emission. With the inclusion of other AGN diagnostics such as X-ray luminosity,
Spitzer/IRAC colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming total
infrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 GHz flux density, qIR, we determine whether
the radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an AGN.
The majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an AGN
at some wavelength. Of the sources with AGN signatures, 58 per cent are hybrid
systems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. This
implies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their star
formation have a high AGN fraction. Below a 1.4 GHz flux density of 1 mJy,
along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from pure
star-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent of

  Online Platforms","To appear in Management Science (2022)",,,,"cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major challenge in obtaining evaluations of products or services on
e-commerce platforms is eliciting informative responses in the absence of
verifiability. This paper proposes the Square Root Agreement Rule (SRA): a
simple reward mechanism that incentivizes truthful responses to objective
evaluations on such platforms. In this mechanism, an agent gets a reward for an
evaluation only if her answer matches that of her peer, where this reward is
inversely proportional to a popularity index of the answer. This index is
defined to be the square root of the empirical frequency at which any two
agents performing the same evaluation agree on the particular answer across
evaluations of similar entities operating on the platform. Rarely agreed-upon
answers thus earn a higher reward than answers for which agreements are
relatively more common.
  We show that in the many tasks regime, the truthful equilibrium under SRA is
strictly payoff-dominant across large classes of natural equilibria that could
arise in these settings, thus increasing the likelihood of its adoption. While
there exist other mechanisms achieving such guarantees, they either impose
additional assumptions on the response distribution that are not generally
satisfied for objective evaluations or they incentivize truthful behavior only
if each agent performs a prohibitively large number of evaluations and commits
to using the same strategy for each evaluation. SRA is the first known
incentive mechanism satisfying such guarantees without imposing any such
requirements. Moreover, our empirical findings demonstrate the robustness of
the incentive properties of SRA in the presence of mild subjectivity or
observational biases in the responses. These properties make SRA uniquely
attractive for administering reward-based incentive schemes (e.g., rebates,
discounts, reputation scores, etc.) on online platforms.

  Endorectal MRI","23 pages",,,,"stat.AP physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer found
in males making early diagnosis important. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
been useful in visualizing and localizing tumor candidates and with the use of
endorectal coils (ERC), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. The
coils introduce intensity inhomogeneities and the surface coil intensity
correction built into MRI scanners is used to reduce these inhomogeneities.
However, the correction typically performed at the MRI scanner level leads to
noise amplification and noise level variations. Methods: In this study, we
introduce a new Monte Carlo-based noise compensation approach for coil
intensity corrected endorectal MRI which allows for effective noise
compensation and preservation of details within the prostate. The approach
accounts for the ERC SNR profile via a spatially-adaptive noise model for
correcting non-stationary noise variations. Such a method is useful
particularly for improving the image quality of coil intensity corrected
endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level and when the original
raw data is not available. Results: SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
analysis in patient experiments demonstrate an average improvement of 11.7 dB
and 11.2 dB respectively over uncorrected endorectal MRI, and provides strong
performance when compared to existing approaches. Conclusions: A new noise
compensation method was developed for the purpose of improving the quality of
coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner
level. We illustrate that promising noise compensation performance can be
achieved for the proposed approach, which is particularly important for
processing coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI
scanner level and when the original raw data is not available.

application areas where the data are observations from an informative sample.
An informative sampling design leads to inclusion probabilities that are
correlated with the response variable of interest. Model inference performed on
the observed sample taken from the population will be biased for the population
generative model under informative sampling since the balance of information in
the sample data is different from that for the population. Typical approaches
to account for an informative sampling design under Bayesian estimation are
often difficult to implement because they require re-parameterization of the
hypothesized generating model, or focus on design, rather than model-based,
inference. We propose to construct a pseudo-posterior distribution that
utilizes sampling weights based on the marginal inclusion probabilities to
exponentiate the likelihood contribution of each sampled unit, which weights
the information in the sample back to the population. Our approach provides a
nearly automated estimation procedure applicable to any model specified by the
data analyst for the population and retains the population model
parameterization and posterior sampling geometry. We construct conditions on
known marginal and pairwise inclusion probabilities that define a class of
sampling designs where $L_{1}$ consistency of the pseudo posterior is
guaranteed. We demonstrate our method on an application concerning the Bureau

Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS). It uses selected attributes from objects in
various domains (e.g. chess problems, classical music, renowned artworks) and
recombines them in such a way as to generate new attributes that can then, in
principle, be used to create novel objects of creative value to humans relating
to any one of the source domains. This allows some of the burden of creative
content generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was
tested in the domain of chess problem composition. We used it to automatically
compose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and
recombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned
paintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical
music tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed
automatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational
chess aesthetics model. They were also assessed by human experts in the domain.
The results suggest that attributes collected and recombined from chess and
other domains using the DSNS approach can indeed be used to automatically
generate chess problems of reasonably high aesthetic quality. In particular, a
low quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players)
used in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce
three-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated
using a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human
experts), and more efficiently as well. Why information from a foreign domain
can be integrated and functional in this way remains an open question for now.
The DSNS approach is, in principle, scalable and applicable to any domain in
which objects have attributes that can be represented using real numbers.

sequence that arrive according to a dependent point process and allow for a
weakened mixing-type dependence in the load pulse magnitudes that
asymptotically decreases to zero with increasing separation in the sequence.
Inclusion of dependence in the model eliminates the unnecessary conservatism
introduced by the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) assumption
often made in determining maximum live load distribution. The scale of
fluctuation of the loading process is used to identify clusters of exceedances
above high thresholds which in turn is used to estimate the extremal index of
the process. A Bayesian updating of the empirical distribution function,
derived from the distribution of order statistics in a dependent stationary

goverened by a stationary lognormal intensity. An illustrative example utilizes
in-service peak strain data from ambient traffic collected on a high volume
highway bridge, and analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the maximum load.

and the acquired compressed samples are generally random in nature. However,
for efficient estimation of the actual signal, the sensing matrix must preserve
the relative distances among the acquired compressed samples. Provided this
condition is fulfilled, we show that CS samples will preserve the envelope of
the actual signal even at different compression ratios. Exploiting this
envelope preserving property of CS samples, we propose a new fast dictionary
learning (DL) algorithm which is able to extract prototype signals from
compressive samples for efficient sparse representation and recovery of
signals. These prototype signals are orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)
extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is one of the popular
methods to capture the envelope of a signal. The extracted IMFs are used to
build the dictionary without even comprehending the original signal or the
sensing matrix. Moreover, one can build the dictionary on-line as new CS
samples are available. In particularly, to recover first $L$ signals
($\in\mathbb{R}^n$) at the decoder, one can build the dictionary in just
$\mathcal{O}(nL\log n)$ operations, that is far less as compared to existing
approaches. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated
experimentally for recovery of speech signals.

gravitationally unstable due to superradiance. These solutions are also
unstable against the Gregory-Laflamme instability and we discuss the conditions

transverse dimensions are compactified and much smaller than the Kerr horizon,
only the superradiant instability is present, with a time scale much longer

a spin-1/2 particle in a uniformly rotating magnetic field. Due to a
non-adiabatic effect, its quantum trajectory on a Bloch sphere is a cycloid
traced by a circle rolling along an adiabatic path. As the magnetic field
rotates more and more slowly, the time-energy uncertainty, proportional to the
distance of the quantum trajectory, calculated by the exact solution is
entirely different from the one obtained by the adiabatic path traced by the
instantaneous state. However, the non-adiabatic Aharonov-Anandan geometric
phase, measured by the area enclosed by the exact path, approaches smoothly the
adiabatic Berry phase, proportional to the area enclosed by the adiabatic path.
The singular limit of the time-energy uncertainty and the regular limit of the
geometric phase are associated with the arc length and arc area of the cycloid
on a Bloch sphere, respectively. Prolate and curtate cycloids are also traced
by different initial states outside and inside of the rolling circle,
respectively. The axis trajectory of the rolling circle, parallel to the
adiabatic path, is shown to be an example of transitionless driving. The
non-adiabatic resonance is visualized by the number of complete cycloid arcs.

(UPHP). The billiard modular group is the scheme within which the dynamics of
classical chaotic systems on surfaces of constant negative curvature is
analyzed. The periodic orbits of the two kinds of billiards are classified,
according to the different symmetry-quotienting mechanisms. The differences
with the description implied by the billiard modular group are investigated and
outlined. In the quantum regime, the eigenvalues (i.e. the sign that
wavefunctions acquire according to quantum BKL maps) for periodic phenomena of
the BKL maps on the Maass wavefunctions are classified. The complete spectrum
of the semiclassical operators which act as BKL map for periodic orbits is
obtained. Differently form the case of the modular group, here it is shown that
the semiclassical transfer operator for Cosmological Billiards is not only the
adjoint operator of the one acting on the Maass waveforms, but that the two
operators are the same \it{self-adjoint} operator, thus outlining a different
approach to the Langlands Jaquet correspondence.

Paxos, RAMBO, and RDS, do not ensure liveness (wait-freedom) in asynchronous
runs with infinitely many reconfigurations. We prove that this is inherent for
asynchronous dynamic storage algorithms, including ones that use $\Omega$ or
$\diamond S$ oracles. Our result holds even if only one process may fail,
provided that machines that were successfully removed from the system's
configuration may be switched off by an administrator. Intuitively, the
impossibility relies on the fact that a correct process can be suspected to
have failed at any time, i.e., its failure is indistinguishable to other
processes from slow delivery of its messages, and so the system should be able
to reconfigure without waiting for this process to complete its pending
operations.
  To circumvent this result, we define a dynamic eventually perfect failure
detector, and present an algorithm that uses it to emulate wait-free dynamic
atomic storage (with no restrictions on reconfiguration rate). Together, our
results thus draw a sharp line between oracles like $\Omega$ and $\diamond S$,
which allow some correct process to continue to be suspected forever, and a
dynamic eventually perfect one, which does not.

adopt the hypothesis that in regions where the pseudoscalar density gradient is
large the properties of photons and fermions are governed by the usual
lagrangian extended with a Chern-Simons interaction for photons and a constant
axial field for fermions. We find that these new pieces in the lagrangian
produce non-trivial reflection coefficients both for photons and fermions when
entering or leaving a region where the pseudoscalar has a non-zero gradient. A
varying pseudoscalar density may also lead to instability of some fermion and
boson modes and modify some properties of the Fermi sea. We speculate that some
of these modifications could influence the cooling rate of stellar matter (for
instance in compact stars) and have other observable consequences. While
quantitative results may depend on precise astrophysical details most of the
consequences are quite universal and consideration should be given to this

the two-dimensional material at the micro-scale. A simple instructive set up is
considered where the near field of a wire antenna is held at sub-micrometric

the graphene conductivity tensor at terahertz frequencies, being modeled by the
Boltzmann transport equation for the valence and conduction electrons at the
Dirac points~(where a linear wave-vector dependence of the band energies is
assumed). The conductivity equation is worked out in different levels of
approximations, based on the relaxation time ansatz with an additional
constraint for particle number conservation. Both drift and diffusion currents
are shown to significantly contribute to the spatially dispersive anisotropic
features of micro-scale graphene. More generally, spatial dispersion effects
are predicted to influence not only plasmon propagation free of external

set the focus on plasmon excitation phenomena induced by near field probes,

$x\in\mathbb{R}^p$ can be accurately recovered from an underdetermined set of
$n$ linear measurements with $n\ll p$, provided that $x$ is sufficiently
sparse. However, in applications, the degree of sparsity $\|x\|_0$ is typically
unknown, and the problem of directly estimating $\|x\|_0$ has been a
longstanding gap between theory and practice. A closely related issue is that
$\|x\|_0$ is a highly idealized measure of sparsity, and for real signals with
entries not equal to 0, the value $\|x\|_0=p$ is not a useful description of
compressibility. In our previous conference paper [Lop13] that examined these
problems, we considered an alternative measure of ""soft"" sparsity,
$\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2$, and designed a procedure to estimate
$\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2$ that does not rely on sparsity assumptions.
  The present work offers a new deconvolution-based method for estimating
unknown sparsity, which has wider applicability and sharper theoretical
guarantees. In particular, we introduce a family of entropy-based sparsity
measures $s_q(x):=\big(\frac{\|x\|_q}{\|x\|_1}\big)^{\frac{q}{1-q}}$
parameterized by $q\in[0,\infty]$. This family interpolates between
$\|x\|_0=s_0(x)$ and $\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2=s_2(x)$ as $q$ ranges over $[0,2]$.
For any $q\in (0,2]\setminus\{1\}$, we propose an estimator $\hat{s}_q(x)$
whose relative error converges at the dimension-free rate of $1/\sqrt{n}$, even
when $p/n\to\infty$. Our main results also describe the limiting distribution
of $\hat{s}_q(x)$, as well as some connections to Basis Pursuit Denosing, the
Lasso, deterministic measurement matrices, and inference problems in CS.

products of H\'enon maps of $\mbb C^2$ that are fibered over a compact metric

composition of a pseudo-random sequence of H\'enon mappings. In analogy with
the dynamics of the iterates of a single H\'enon map, it is possible to
construct fibered Green functions that satisfy suitable invariance properties
and the corresponding stable and unstable currents. Further, it is shown that
the successive pullbacks of a suitable current by the skew H\'enon maps
converge to a multiple of the fibered stable current.
  Second part of the thesis generalizes most of the above-mentioned results for
a completely random sequence of H\'enon maps. In addition, for this random
system of H\'enon maps, we introduce the notion of average Green functions and
average Green currents which carry many typical features of the classical Green
functions and Green currents.
  Third part consists of some results about the global dynamics of a special
class of skew maps. To prove these results, we use the knowledge of dynamical
behavior of pseudo-random sequence of H\'enon maps widely. We show that the
global skew map is strongly mixing for a class of invariant measures and also
provide a lower bound on the topological entropy of the skew product.
  We conclude the thesis by studying another class of maps which are skew
products of holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mbb P^k$ fibered over a compact
base. We define the fibered Fatou components and show that they are
pseudoconvex and Kobayashi hyperbolic.

configurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,
and equations of state. For this purpose we employ the SGRID code, which allows
us to construct such data in previously inaccessible regions of the parameter
space. In particular, we consider spinning neutron stars in isolation and in
binary systems; we incorporate new methods to produce highly eccentric and
eccentricity reduced data; we present the possibility of computing data for
significantly unequal-mass binaries; and we create equal-mass binaries with
individual compactness up to 0.23. As a proof of principle, we explore the
dynamical evolution of three new configurations. First, we simulate a $q=2.06$
mass ratio which is the highest mass ratio for a binary neutron star evolved in
numerical relativity to date. We find that mass transfer from the companion
star sets in a few revolutions before merger and a rest mass of
$\sim10^{-2}M_\odot$ is transferred between the two stars. This configuration
also ejects a large amount of material during merger, imparting a substantial
kick to the remnant. Second, we simulate the first merger of a precessing
binary neutron star. We present the dominant modes of the gravitational waves
for the precessing simulation, where a clear imprint of the precession is
visible in the (2,1) mode. Finally, we quantify the effect of an eccentricity
reduction procedure on the gravitational waveform. The procedure improves the
waveform quality and should be employed in future precision studies, but also
other errors, notably truncation errors, need to be reduced in order for the
improvement due to eccentricity reduction to be effective. [abridged]

one-dimensional SU(2)$\otimes XXZ$ model with SU(2) spin exchange and
anisotropic $XXZ$ orbital exchange interactions and negative exchange coupling.
As a unique feature, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy in the entangled
ground states increases here linearly with system size. In the case of Ising
orbital interactions we identify an emergent phase with long-range spin-singlet
dimer correlations triggered by a quadrupling of correlations in the orbital
sector. The peculiar translational invariant spin-singlet dimer phase has
finite von Neumann entanglement entropy and survives when orbital quantum
fluctuations are included. It even persists in the isotropic
SU(2)$\otimes$SU(2) limit. Surprisingly, for finite transverse orbital coupling
the long-range spin singlet correlations also coexist in the antiferromagnetic
spin and alternating orbital phase making this phase also unconventional.
Moreover we also find a complementary orbital singlet phase that exists in the
isotropic case but does not extend to the Ising limit. The nature of
entanglement appears essentially different from that found in the frequently
discussed model with positive coupling. Furthermore we investigate the
collective spin and orbital wave excitations of the disentangled
ferromagnetic-spin/ferro-orbital ground state and explore the continuum of
spin-orbital excitations. Interestingly one finds among the latter excitations
two modes of exciton bound states. Their spin-orbital correlations differ from
the remaining continuum states and exhibit logarithmic scaling of the von
Neumann entropy with increasing system size.

high-dimensional data points into a union of low-dimensional linear subspaces,
whose number, orientations, and dimensions are all unknown. In practice one may
have access to dimensionality-reduced observations of the data only, resulting,
e.g., from undersampling due to complexity and speed constraints on the
acquisition device or mechanism. More pertinently, even if the high-dimensional
data set is available it is often desirable to first project the data points
into a lower-dimensional space and to perform clustering there; this reduces
storage requirements and computational cost. The purpose of this paper is to
quantify the impact of dimensionality reduction through random projection on
the performance of three subspace clustering algorithms, all of which are based
on principles from sparse signal recovery. Specifically, we analyze the
thresholding based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm, the sparse subspace
clustering (SSC) algorithm, and an orthogonal matching pursuit variant thereof
(SSC-OMP). We find, for all three algorithms, that dimensionality reduction
down to the order of the subspace dimensions is possible without incurring
significant performance degradation. Moreover, these results are order-wise
optimal in the sense that reducing the dimensionality further leads to a
fundamentally ill-posed clustering problem. Our findings carry over to the
noisy case as illustrated through analytical results for TSC and simulations
for SSC and SSC-OMP. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
complement our theoretical findings.

densities are extended to ultrahigh dimensional settings and compared to other
variable selection procedures using precision-recall curves. Variable selection
procedures included in these comparisons include methods based on $g$-priors,
reciprocal lasso, adaptive lasso, scad, and minimax concave penalty criteria.
The use of precision-recall curves eliminates the sensitivity of our
conclusions to the choice of tuning parameters. We find that Bayesian variable
selection procedures based on nonlocal priors are competitive to all other
procedures in a range of simulation scenarios, and we subsequently explain this
favorable performance through a theoretical examination of their consistency
properties. When certain regularity conditions apply, we demonstrate that the
nonlocal procedures are consistent for linear models even when the number of
covariates $p$ increases sub-exponentially with the sample size $n$. A model
selection procedure based on Zellner's $g$-prior is also found to be
competitive with penalized likelihood methods in identifying the true model,
but the posterior distribution on the model space induced by this method is
much more dispersed than the posterior distribution induced on the model space
by the nonlocal prior methods. We investigate the asymptotic form of the
marginal likelihood based on the nonlocal priors and show that it attains a
unique term that cannot be derived from the other Bayesian model selection
procedures. We also propose a scalable and efficient algorithm called
Simplified Shotgun Stochastic Search with Screening (S5) to explore the
enormous model space, and we show that S5 dramatically reduces the computing
time without losing the capacity to search the interesting region in the model
space. The S5 algorithm is available in an \verb R ~package {\it BayesS5} on
