method to analyze unbinned direct dark matter detection data. Instead of the
recoil energy as independent variable we use the minimum speed a dark matter
particle must have to impart a given recoil energy to a nucleus. This has the
advantage of allowing us to apply the method to any type of target composition
and interaction, e.g. with general momentum and velocity dependence, and with
elastic or inelastic scattering. We prove the method and provide a rigorous
statistical interpretation of the results. As first applications, we find that
for dark matter particles with elastic spin-independent interactions and
neutron to proton coupling ratio $f_n/f_p=-0.7$, the WIMP interpretation of the
signal observed by CDMS-II-Si is compatible with the constraints imposed by all
other experiments with null results. We also find a similar compatibility for
exothermic inelastic spin-independent interactions with $f_n/f_p=-0.8$.

suggested that the intrinsic alignment contamination can be $15\%$ of this
cross-spectrum for the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope
surveys. Here we re-examine these estimates using up-to-date observational
constraints of intrinsic alignments at a redshift more similar to that of CS82
galaxies. We find a $\approx$ $10\%$ contamination of the cross-spectrum from
red galaxies, with $\approx$ $3\%$ uncertainty due to uncertainties in the
redshift distribution of source galaxies and the modelling of the spectral
energy distribution. Blue galaxies are consistent with being unaligned, but
could contaminate the cross-spectrum by an additional $9.5\%$ within current
$95\%$ confidence levels. While our fiducial estimate of alignment
contamination is similar to previous work, our work suggests that the relevance
of alignments for CMB lensing-galaxy lensing cross-correlation remains largely
unconstrained. Little information is currently available about alignments at
$z>1.2$. We consider the upper limiting case where all $z>1.2$ galaxies are
aligned with the same strength as low redshift luminous red galaxies, finding

systematic search (started after the first localization in 1997) led to only
374 spectroscopic redshift measurements. For less than half, the host galaxy is
detected and studied in some detail. Despite the small number of known hosts,
their impact on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is immense.
These galaxies offer the opportunity to explore regions which are
observationally hostile, due to the presence of gas and dust, or the large
distances reached. The typical long-duration GRB host galaxy at low redshift is
small, star-forming and metal poor, whereas, at intermediate redshift, many
hosts are massive, dusty and chemically evolved. Going even farther in the past
of the Universe, at z > 5, long-GRB hosts have never been identified, even with
the deepest NIR space observations, meaning that these galaxies are very small
(stellar mass < 10^7 M_sun). We considered the possibility that some high-z
GRBs occurred in primordial globular clusters, systems that evolved drastically
since the beginning, but would have back then the characteristics necessary to
host a GRB. At that time, the fraction of stellar mass contained in proto
globular clusters might have been orders of magnitude higher than today. Plus,
these objects contained in the past many massive fast rotating binary systems,
which are also regarded as a favorable situation for GRBs. The common factor
for all long GRBs at any redshift is the stellar progenitor: it is a very

representing and reasoning on knowledge involving sets of objects collectively.
Current implementations simplify the structure of programs in order to optimize
the overall performance. In particular, aggregates are rewritten into simpler
forms known as monotone aggregates. Since the evaluation of normal programs
with monotone aggregates is in general on a lower complexity level than the
evaluation of normal programs with arbitrary aggregates, any faithful
translation function must introduce disjunction in rule heads in some cases.
However, no function of this kind is known. The paper closes this gap by
introducing a polynomial, faithful, and modular translation for rewriting
common aggregation functions into the simpler form accepted by current solvers.
A prototype system allows for experimenting with arbitrary recursive
aggregates, which are also supported in the recent version 4.5 of the grounder
\textsc{gringo}, using the methods presented in this paper.

analyzed, most SMOs are implemented computationally using a continuous

formation of a boundary layer in a neighborhood of the sliding manifold in the

attenuating the effect of the boundary layer and guaranteeing performance
bounds on the resulting state estimation error. In this paper, a method is
proposed for constructing boundary-layer SMOs (BL-SMOs) with prescribed state

simultaneously estimate exogenous inputs (disturbance signals in the state and
output vector fields), along with the system state. Two numerical examples are

use optical-near-infrared photometry to estimate stellar masses and star
formation rates (SFR) of centrals and satellites down to ~6*10^9 Msun. We stack
data around 215 central galaxies to statistically detect their satellite halos,
finding an average of ~3 galaxies in excess of the background density. We fit
the radial profiles of satellites with simple beta-models, and compare their
integrated properties to model predictions. We find that the total stellar mass
of satellites amounts to 68% of the central galaxy, while SED modeling and
far-infrared photometry consistently show their total SFR to be 25-35% of the
central's rate. We also see significant variation in the specific SFR of
satellites within the halo with, in particular, a sharp decrease at <100 kpc.
After considering different potential explanations, we conclude that this is
likely an environmental signature of the hot inner halo. This effect can be
explained in the first order by a simple free-fall scenario, suggesting that
these low-mass environments can shut down star formation in satellites on
relatively short timescales of ~0.3 Gyr.

remnants (SNR) with dense interstellar clouds as well as cosmochemical studies
of the abundances of daughter products of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRIs)
formed by supernova nucleosynthesis support the hypothesis that the Solar
Systems SLRIs may have been derived from a supernova. This paper continues a
series devoted to examining whether such a shock wave could have triggered the
dynamical collapse of a dense, presolar cloud core and simultaneously injected
sufficient abundances of SLRIs to explain the cosmochemical evidence. Here we
examine the effects of shock waves striking clouds whose spin axes are oriented
perpendicular, rather than parallel, to the direction of propagation of the
shock front. The models start with 2.2 solar mass cloud cores and shock speeds
of 20 or 40 km/sec. Central protostars and protoplanetary disks form in all
models, though with disk spin axes aligned somewhat randomly. The disks derive
most of their angular momentum not from the initial cloud rotation, but from
the Rayleigh-Taylor fingers that also inject shock wave SLRIs. Injection
efficiencies, fi, the fraction of the incident shock wave material injected
into the collapsing cloud core, are 0.04 - 0.1 in these models, similar to when
the rotation axis is parallel to the shock propagation direction. Evidently
altering the rotation axis orientation has only a minor effect on the outcome,
strengthening the case for this scenario as an explanation for the Solar
Systems SLRIs.

waves are sustained by the matching of translations with rotations,the Peano
modes correspond to the matching of the eightfold symmetry with discrete
dilatations. The eightfold symmetry is shared by the Peano chain with the
octagonal quasicrystal, but the latter has a much higher connectivity. The
relaxation process which starts from the Peano chain is found to mark the

captured by including SOC non-perturbatively. The exact classical groundstates,
which we obtain for arbitrary SOC, are governed by the SU(2) fluxes associated
with SOC threading the constituent triangles. The groundstates break the SO(2)
symmetry, and the associated Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
temperature is determined by the SU(2) fluxes through the triangles, which we
confirm by finite temperature classical Monte Carlo simulation.

single-bp mutations (SNPs) in aligned pairs distinguish clonally inherited
regions from regions where either genome has acquired DNA fragments from
diverged genomes by homologous recombination since their last common ancestor.
Such recombinant transfer is pervasive across the basic genome, mostly between
genomes in the same evolutionary group, and generates many unique mosaic
patterns. The six least-diverged genome-pairs have one or two recombinant
transfers of length ~40-115 kbp (and few if any other transfers), each
containing one or more gene clusters known to confer strong selective advantage
in some environments. Moderately diverged genome-pairs (0.4-1% SNPs ) show
mosaic patterns of interspersed clonal and recombinant regions of varying
lengths throughout the basic genome, whereas more highly diverged pairs within
an evolutionary group or pairs between evolutionary groups having >1.3% SNPs
have few clonal matches longer than a few kbp. Many recombinant transfers
appear to incorporate fragments of the entering DNA produced by restriction
systems of the recipient cell. A simple computational model can closely fit the

transduction by co-evolving populations of phages, which could efficiently
distribute variability throughout bacterial genomes.

connected by topological surface arcs. The low-energy excitations near the
crossing points behave the same as massless Weyl fermions, leading to exotic
properties like chiral anomaly. To have the transport properties dominated by
Weyl fermions, Weyl nodes need to locate nearly at the chemical potential and
enclosed by pairs of individual Fermi surfaces with nonzero Fermi Chern
numbers. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
first-principles calculation, here we show that TaP is a Weyl semimetal with
only single type of Weyl fermions, topologically distinguished from TaAs where
two types of Weyl fermions contribute to the low-energy physical properties.
The simple Weyl fermions in TaP are not only of fundamental interests but also
of great potential for future applications. Fermi arcs on the Ta-terminated
surface are observed, which appear in a different pattern from that on the
As-termination in TaAs and NbAs.

observational studies. Sensitivity analysis provides an attractive way to
partially circumvent this issue by assessing the potential influence of
unmeasured confounding on the causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity
analysis approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as having
a confounder that is binary, or having no interaction between the effects of
the exposure and the confounder on the outcome, or having only one confounder.
Without imposing any assumptions on the confounder or confounders, we derive a
bounding factor and a sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis
parameters must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to
explain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a particular level.
Our approach is easy to implement and involves only two sensitivity parameters.
Surprisingly, our bounding factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is
no more conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis techniques
that do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor implies not only the
traditional Cornfield conditions that both the relative risk of the exposure on
the confounder and that of the confounder on the outcome must satisfy, but also
a high threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy.
Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure of the
strength of confounding between the exposure and the outcome induced by a
confounder.

successfully applied to describing the properties of nuclei, atoms, and
molecules, their interactions with each other as well as with external fields.
Due to the properties of quantum rotations, the angular momentum algebra can be
of tremendous complexity even for a few interacting particles, such as valence
electrons of an atom, not to mention larger many-particle systems. In this
work, we study an example of the latter: a rotating quantum impurity coupled to
a many-body bosonic bath. In the regime of strong impurity-bath couplings the
problem involves addition of an infinite number of angular momenta which
renders it intractable using currently available techniques. Here, we introduce
a novel canonical transformation which allows to eliminate the complex angular
momentum algebra from such a class of many-body problems. In addition, the
transformation exposes the problem's constants of motion, and renders it
solvable exactly in the limit of a slowly-rotating impurity. We exemplify the
technique by showing that there exists a critical rotational speed at which the
impurity suddenly acquires one quantum of angular momentum from the
many-particle bath. Such an instability is accompanied by the deformation of
the phonon density in the frame rotating along with the impurity.

stable. However, the partial ionisation of hydrogen, helium and iron gives rise
to extended sub-surface convection zones in all of them. In this work, we
investigate the effect of the pressure induced by the turbulent motion in these
zones based on the mixing length theory, and search for observable
consequences. We find that the turbulent pressure fraction can amount up to ~5%
in OB supergiants, and to ~30% in cooler supergiants. The resulting structural
changes are, however, not significantly affecting the evolutionary tracks
compared to previous calculations. Instead, a comparison of macroturbulent
velocities derived from high quality spectra of OB stars with the turbulent
pressure fraction obtained in corresponding stellar models reveals a strong
correlation of these two quantities. We discuss a possible physical connection,
and conclude that turbulent pressure fluctuations may drive high-order
oscillations, which - as conjectured earlier - manifest themselves as
macroturbulence in the photospheres of hot luminous stars.

events than signal ones due to the relatively small mistagging rate for light
quarks. The basic idea is tested with two rare top decay processes: i) t -> c h

found in multiple searches with the IceCube detector. The first solid evidence
was provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies
$\gtrsim30$ TeV and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. Recent
analyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies and
is also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the Northern
hemisphere. Here, we combine the results from six different IceCube searches
for astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. The combined
event sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-like
events. The data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle and
event topology. Assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and to
consist of equal flavors at Earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrino
energies between 25 TeV and 2.8 PeV is well described by an unbroken power law
with best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 TeV of
$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.
Under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavored
with a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the best
fit. This significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead we
compare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponential
cut-off at high energies. Allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate from
the other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at Earth.
The sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic of
neutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6
$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

origin of the thermal X-ray component may be either release of heat from the
core of the neutron star, or continuing low-level accretion. In general, heat
from the core should be stable on timescales $<10^4$ years, while continuing
accretion may produce variations on a range of timescales. While some quiescent
neutron stars (e.g. Cen X-4, Aql X-1) have shown variations in their thermal
components on a range of timescales, several others, particularly those in
globular clusters with no detectable nonthermal hard X-rays (fit with a
powerlaw), have shown no measurable variations. Here, we constrain the spectral
variations of 12 low mass X-ray binaries in 3 globular clusters over $\sim10$
years. We find no evidence of variations in 10 cases, with limits on
temperature variations below 11% for the 7 qLMXBs without powerlaw components,

work adds to the evidence that the thermal X-ray component in quiescent neutron
stars without powerlaw components can be explained by heat deposited in the
core during outbursts. Finally, we also investigate the correlation between
hydrogen column density (N$_H$) and optical extinction (A$_V$) using our sample

the right mass subhalos have steeper profiles at these radii than measurements

solve this discrepancy by invoking baryonic effects. Assuming that feedback
from supernovae can lead to a reshaping of the halos, we compute the required

shallow. These results could be used to calibrate and possibly constrain
feedback recipes in hydrodynamical simulations.

energy liberated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can be channeled
into large-scale toroidal magnetic fields through dynamo action. Under certain
conditions, this field can dominate over gas and radiation pressure in
providing vertical support against gravity, even close to the midplane. Using a
simple model for the creation of this field, its buoyant rise, and its coupling
to the gas, we show how disks could be driven into this magnetically dominated
state and deduce the resulting vertical pressure and density profiles. Applying
an established criterion for MRI to operate in the presence of a toroidal
field, we show that magnetically supported disks can have two distinct
MRI-active regions, separated by a ""dead zone"" where local MRI is suppressed,
but where magnetic energy continues to flow upward from the dynamo region
below. We suggest that the relative strengths of the MRI zones, and the local
poloidal flux, determine the spectral states of X-ray binaries. Specifically,
""intermediate"" and ""hard"" accretion states occur when MRI is triggered in the
hot, upper zone of the corona, while disks in ""soft"" states do not develop the
upper MRI zone. We discuss the conditions under which various transitions
should take place and speculate on the relationship of dynamo activity to the
various types of quasi-periodic oscillations that sometimes appear in the hard
spectral components. The model also explains why luminous accretion disks in
the ""soft"" state show no signs of the thermal/viscous instability predicted by
standard alpha models.

z~1, made possible by the WFC3 grism on HST. Employing this capability over all
five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. By creating deep
stacked Halpha (Ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of
1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionized
gas out to >10kpc for typical L* galaxies at this epoch. We find that the
spatial extent of the Ha distribution increases with stellar mass as
r(Ha)[kpc]=1.5(Mstars/10^10Msun)^0.23. Furthermore, the Ha emission is more
extended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out
assembly of galactic disks. This effect, however, is mass dependent with
r(Ha)/r(stars)=1.1(M/10^10Msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(Ha)~r(stars).
We map the Ha distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for
`coherent star formation' across the SFR-M plane: above the main sequence, Ha
is enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, Ha is depressed at all
radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the
enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of
galaxies. It also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequence
is real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. At
high masses (10^10.5<M/Msun<10^11), above the main sequence, Ha is particularly
enhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive black
holes. Below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and a
strong central dip in the EW(Ha), and the inferred specific star formation
rate, appears. Importantly though, across the entirety of the SFR-M plane, the
absolute star formation rate as traced by Ha is always centrally peaked, even
in galaxies below the main sequence.

their strong ionizing radiation fields and powerful stellar winds. Since these
winds are considered to be driven by radiation pressure, it is theoretically
expected that the degree of the wind mass-loss depends on the initial
metallicity of WR stars. Following our comprehensive studies of WR stars in the
Milky Way, M31, and the LMC, we derive stellar parameters and mass-loss rates
for all seven putatively single WN stars known in the SMC. Based on these data,
we discuss the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the mass loss and
evolution of WR stars. The quantitative analysis of the WN stars is performed
with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The physical
properties of our program stars are obtained from fitting synthetic spectra to
multi-band observations. In all SMC WN stars, a considerable surface hydrogen
abundance is detectable. The majority of these objects have stellar
temperatures exceeding 75 kK, while their luminosities range from 10^5.5 to
10^6.1 Lsun. The WN stars in the SMC exhibit on average lower mass-loss rates
and weaker winds than their counterparts in the Milky Way, M31, and the LMC. By
comparing the mass-loss rates derived for WN stars in different Local Group
galaxies, we conclude that a clear dependence of the wind mass-loss on the
initial metallicity is evident, supporting the current paradigm that WR winds
are driven by radiation. A metallicity effect on the evolution of massive stars
is obvious from the HRD positions of the SMC WN stars at high temperatures and
high luminosities. Standard evolution tracks are not able to reproduce these
parameters and the observed surface hydrogen abundances. Homogeneous evolution
might provide a better explanation for their evolutionary past.

learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata

between quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical descriptions of isolated
quantum systems. Here, we define unbiased measures for how well the ETH works
in various regimes, by mapping general interacting quantum systems on regular
lattices onto a single particle living on a high-dimensional graph. By
numerically analyzing deviations from ETH behavior in the non-integrable Ising
model, we propose a quantity that we call the $n$-$weight$ to democratically
characterize the average deviations for all operators residing on a given
number of sites, irrespective of their spatial structure. It appears to have a
simple scaling form, that we conjecture to hold true for all non-integrable
systems. A closely related quantity, that we term the $n$-$distinguishability$,
tells us how well two states can be distinguished if only $n$-site operators
are measured. Along the way, we discover that complicated operators on average
are worse than simple ones at distinguishing between neighboring eigenstates,
contrary to the naive intuition created by the usual statements of the ETH that
few-body (many-body) operators acquire the same (different) expectation values
in nearby eigenstates at finite energy density. Finally, we sketch heuristic
arguments that the ETH originates from the limited ability of simple operators
to distinguish between quantum states of a system, especially when the states
are subject to constraints such as roughly fixed energy with respect to a local
Hamiltonian.

compelling evidence for the existence of a high energy astrophysical neutrino
flux utilizing a dominantly Southern Hemisphere dataset consisting primarily of
nu_e and nu_tau charged current and neutral current (cascade) neutrino
interactions. In the analysis presented here, a data sample of approximately
35,000 muon neutrinos from the Northern sky was extracted from data taken
during 659.5 days of livetime recorded between May 2010 and May 2012. While
this sample is composed primarily of neutrinos produced by cosmic ray
interactions in the Earth's atmosphere, the highest energy events are
inconsistent with a hypothesis of solely terrestrial origin at 3.7 sigma
significance. These neutrinos can, however, be explained by an astrophysical
flux per neutrino flavor at a level of Phi(E_nu) = 9.9^{+3.9}_{-3.4} times
10^{-19} GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} s^{-1} ({E_nu / 100 TeV})^{-2}, consistent
with IceCube's Southern Hemisphere dominated result. Additionally, a fit for an
astrophysical flux with an arbitrary spectral index was performed. We find a
spectral index of 2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, which is also in good agreement with the
Southern Hemisphere result.

practice has been to assume a $100\%$ decay branching fraction for a given

significant decay modes to be present, which significantly weaken the current
sbottom search limits at the LHC. On the other hand, the combination of the
multiple decay modes offers alternative discovery channels for sbottom
searches. In this paper, we present the sbottom decays in a few representative
mass parameter scenarios. We then analyze the sbottom signal for the pair
production in QCD with one sbottom decaying via $\tilde{b}\rightarrow b
\chi_1^0,\ b \chi_2^0$, and the other one decaying via $\tilde{b} \rightarrow t

avoid overclosing the universe. The decay of the light mediator could happen
due to a weak coupling of the hidden and visible sectors, providing new
signatures for direct detection experiments. The SIDM nuclear recoil spectrum
is more peaked towards low energies compared to the usual case of contact

of nuclear recoils. We show that the SIDM signal could be distinguished from
that of DM particles with contact interactions by considering the time-average

viscous timescale between chondrule formation and chondrite accretion. Further,
we find older disks to be severely diminished of chondrules, with accretion
rates $\lesssim 10^{-9}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ for nominal parameters. We then
characterize the distribution of chondrule origins in both space and time, as
functions of disk parameters and chondrule formation rates, in runs with

weakly stable tearing perturbation in a rotating toroidal plasma. In this paper
it is shown that the locking characteristics for modes with finite real
frequencies $\omega_{r}$ are quite different from the conventional results. A
calculation of the tearing mode amplitude assuming modes with frequencies
$\pm\omega_{r}$ in the plasma frame shows that it is maximized when the
frequency of the stable backward propagating mode ($-\omega_{r}$) in the lab
frame is zero, i.e. when $v=\omega_{r}/k$. Even more importantly, the locking
torque is exactly zero at the mode phase velocity, with a pronounced peak at
just higher rotation, leading to a locked state with plasma velocity $v$ just
above the mode phase velocity in the lab frame. Real frequencies
$\pm\omega_{r}$, leading to a $v\rightarrow-v$ symmetry, are known to occur due
to the Glasser effect [A.H. Glasser, J.M. Greene, and J.M. Johnson, Phys.
Fluids {\bf 19}, 567 (1976).] for modes in the resistive-inertial (RI) regime.
This therefore leads to locking of the plasma velocity to just above the phase
velocity. It is also shown that similar real frequencies occur over a range of
parameters in the visco-resistive (VR) regime with pressure, and the locking
torque is similar to that in the RI regime. Real frequencies occur due to
diamagnetic effects in other tearing mode regimes and also show this effect,
but without the $v\rightarrow-v$ symmetry. Nonlinear effects on the mode
amplitude and torque for weakly stable modes or large error fields are
discussed. Also, the possibility of applying external fields of different
helicities to drive sheared flows in toroidal plasmas is discussed.

acoustic models are built using features of clean utterances, the features of a
noisy test utterance would be acoustically mismatched with the trained model.
This gives poor likelihoods and poor recognition accuracy. Model adaptation and
feature normalisation are two broad areas that address this problem. While the
former often gives better performance, the latter involves estimation of lesser
number of parameters, making the system feasible for practical implementations.
  This research focuses on the efficacies of various subspace, statistical and
stereo based feature normalisation techniques. A subspace projection based
method has been investigated as a standalone and adjunct technique involving
reconstruction of noisy speech features from a precomputed set of clean speech
building-blocks. The building blocks are learned using non-negative matrix
factorisation (NMF) on log-Mel filter bank coefficients, which form a basis for
the clean speech subspace. The work provides a detailed study on how the method
can be incorporated into the extraction process of Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients. Experimental results show that the new features are robust to
noise, and achieve better results when combined with the existing techniques.
  The work also proposes a modification to the training process of SPLICE
algorithm for noise robust speech recognition. It is based on feature
correlations, and enables this stereo-based algorithm to improve the
performance in all noise conditions, especially in unseen cases. Further, the
modified framework is extended to work for non-stereo datasets where clean and
noisy training utterances, but not stereo counterparts, are required. An
MLLR-based computationally efficient run-time noise adaptation method in SPLICE

and consistently computes the emission of synchro-curvature radiation. By
fitting observational data on a case by case basis, we are able to obtain
constraints about the parallel electric field, the typical lengthscale over
which particles emit the bulk of the detected radiation, and the number of
involved particles. The model copes well with data of several dozens of
millisecond and young pulsars. By correlating the inferred model parameters
with the observed timing properties, some trends are discovered. First, a
non-negligible part of the radiation comes from the loss of perpendicular
momentum soon after pair creation. Second, the electric field strongly
correlates with both the inverse of the emission lengthscale and the magnetic
field at light cylinder, thus ruling out models with high-energy photon
production close to the surface. These correlations unify young and millisecond
pulsars under the same physical scenario, and predict that magnetars are
intrinsically $\gamma$-ray quiet via syncrhro-curvature processes, since
magnetospheric particles are not accelerated enough to emit a detectable

deterministic automata. Learning nondeterministic automata is another matter.
This is important because much of the world is nondeterministic, taking the
form of unpredictable or probabilistic events that must be acted upon. If ANNs
are to engage such phenomena, then they must be able to learn how to deal with
nondeterminism. In this project the game of Pong poses a nondeterministic
environment. The learner is given an incomplete view of the game state and
underlying deterministic physics, resulting in a nondeterministic game. Three
models were trained and tested on the game: Mona, Elman, and Numenta's NuPIC.

ambiguities, some of which have been known for over a century. Several, such as
Gibbs' paradox, involve the fact that classical particles are distinguishable,
and in textbooks these are often `resolved' by appeal to the quantum-mechanical
indistinguishability of atoms or molecules of the same type. However, questions
then remain of how to correctly define the entropy of large poly-atomic
particles such as colloids in suspension, of which no two are exactly alike. By
performing experiments on such colloids, one can establish that certain
definitions of the classical entropy fit the data, while others in the
literature do not. Specifically, the experimental facts point firmly to an
`informatic' interpretation that dates back to Gibbs: entropy is determined by
the number of microstates that we as observers choose to treat as equivalent
when we identify a macrostate. This approach, unlike some others, can account
for the existence of colloidal crystals, and for the observed abundances of
colloidal clusters of different shapes. We also address some lesser-known
paradoxes whereby the physics of colloidal assemblies, which ought to be purely
classical, seems to involve quantum mechanics directly. The experimental
symptoms of such involvement are predicted to be `isotope effects' in which
colloids with different inertial masses, but otherwise identical sizes and
properties, show different aggregation statistics. These paradoxes are caused
by focussing one's attention on some classical degrees while neglecting others;
when all are treated equally, all isotope effects are found to vanish.

extent of thermal oxidation. A major component of the oxidation, as indicated
from optical and Raman data, starts from the nano-sheet edges and propagates
laterally towards the center. Partial oxidation also occurs in certain areas at
the surface of the flakes, which are shown to be highly conductive by microwave
impedance microscopy. Using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, we also observed
extensive oxidation at the WSe2/SiO2 interface. The combination of multiple
microcopy methods can thus provide vital information on the spatial evolution
of chemical reactions on 2D materials and the nanoscale electrical properties
of the reaction products.

(0.3--30 keV) quiescent luminosity of the source is 8.9$\times$10$^{32}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ for a distance of 2.4 kpc. The source shows clear variability on short
time scales (an hour to a couple of hours) in radio, soft X-ray and hard X-ray
bands in the form of multiple flares. The broad-band X-ray spectra obtained
from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR can be characterized with a power-law model having
photon index $\Gamma$=2.12$\pm$0.07 (90\% confidence errors); however,
residuals at high energies indicate spectral curvature significant at a
3$\sigma$ confidence level with e-folding energy of the cutoff to be
20$^{+20}_{-7}$ keV. Such curvature can be explained using synchrotron emission
from the base of a jet outflow. Radio observations using the VLA reveal that
the spectral index evolves on very fast time-scales (as short as 10 min.),
switching between optically thick and thin synchrotron emission, possibly due
to instabilities in the compact jet or stochastic instabilities in accretion
rate. We explore different scenarios to explain this very fast variability.

linear mesh, that is subsequently curved without taking care of the validity of

untangle invalid elements and optimize the geometrical accuracy of the mesh.
Standard measures of the distance between curves are considered to evaluate the
geometrical accuracy in planar two-dimensional meshes, but they prove
computationally too costly for optimization purposes. A fast estimate of the
geometrical accuracy, based on Taylor expansions of the curves, is introduced.
An unconstrained optimization procedure based on this estimate is shown to
yield significant improvements in the geometrical accuracy of high order

model and the mesh. Several examples illustrate the beneficial impact of this
method on CFD solutions, with a particular role of the enhanced mesh boundary

low-latitude CMEs in almost all respects: three-part morphology, post eruption
arcade (PEA), CME and filament kinematics, CME mass and kinetic energy, and the
relative thermal energy content of the PEA. From polarized brightness images,
we estimate the CME mass, which is close to the average mass of low-latitude
CMEs. The CME kinetic energy (3.3x1030 erg) is also typical of the general
population of CMEs. From photospheric magnetograms, we estimate the free energy
(1.8x1031 erg) in the polar crown source region, which we find is sufficient to
power the CME and the PEA. About 19% of the free energy went into the CME
kinetic energy. We compute the thermal energy content of the PEA (2.3x1029 erg)
and find it to be a small fraction (6.8%) of the CME kinetic energy. This
fraction is remarkably similar to that in active region CMEs associated with
major flares. We also show that the 2012 March 12 is one among scores of polar
CMEs observed during the maximum phase of cycle 24. The cycle 24 polar crown
prominence eruptions have the same rate of association with CMEs as those from
low-latitudes. This investigation supports the view that all CMEs are
magnetically propelled from closed field regions, irrespective of their
location on the Sun (polar crown filament regions, quiescent filament regions

affects the dynamics as quantified by the final adoption size. Strikingly, we
uncover a transition phenomenon in which the dependence of the final adoption
size on some key parameters, such as the transmission probability, can change
from being discontinuous to being continuous. The transition can be triggered
by proper parameters and structural perturbations to the system, such as
decreasing individuals' adoption threshold, increasing initial seed size, or

higher order in the perturbative coupling, we show that the two contributions

semi-classical expansion using Lefschetz thimbles is not only a meaningful
prescription for higher order semi-classics, but a necessary one. This
deduction seems to be universal and applicable to both supersymmetric and

qualities and must learn about each other over time via repeated interactions.
This paper is the first to provide a methodology for studying the dynamics of
such networks, taking into account that agents differ from each other, that
they begin with incomplete information, and that they must learn through past
experiences which connections/links to form and which to break. The network
dynamics in our model vary drastically from the dynamics in models of complete
information. With incomplete information and learning, agents who provide high
benefits will develop high reputations and remain in the network, while agents
who provide low benefits will drop in reputation and become ostracized. We
show, among many other things, that the information to which agents have access
and the speed at which they learn and act can have a tremendous impact on the
resulting network dynamics. Using our model, we can also compute the ex ante
social welfare given an arbitrary initial network, which allows us to
characterize the socially optimal network structures for different sets of
agents. Importantly, we show through examples that the optimal network
structure depends sharply on both the initial beliefs of the agents, as well as
the rate of learning by the agents. Due to the potential negative consequences
of ostracism, it may be necessary to place agents with lower initial
reputations at less central positions within the network.

they are least affected by the hierarchical pattern of galaxy growth, and
interactions with perturbers, at least for the last few Gyr. To form a
comprehensive picture of the star formation history of isolated galaxies, we
constructed a catalog of isolated galaxies and their comparison sample in
relatively denser environments. The galaxies are drawn from the SDSS DR7 in the
redshift range of $0.025<z<0.044$. We performed a visual inspection and
classified their morphology following the Hubble classification scheme. For the
spectroscopic study, we make use of the OSSY catalog. We confirm most of the
earlier understanding on isolated galaxies. The most remarkable additional
results are as follows. Isolated galaxies are dominantly late type with the
morphology distribution (E: S0: S: Irr) = (9.9: 11.3: 77.6: 1.2)\%. The
frequency of elliptical galaxies among isolated galaxies is only a third of
that of the comparison sample. Most of the photometric and spectroscopic
properties are surprisingly similar between isolated and comparison samples.
However, early-type isolated galaxies are less massive by 50\% and younger (by
H$\beta$) by 20\% than their counterparts in the comparison sample. This can be
explained as a result of different merger and star formation histories for
differing environments in the hierarchical merger paradigm. We provide an
on-line catalog for the list and properties of our sample galaxies.

Chatterjee and Dembo showed that in the sparse regime of $p\to 0$ as

this problem reduces to a natural variational problem on weighted graphs, which

coupled field equations governing the perturbations sourced by the particle
share the same form as the field equations for perturbations of a scalarvac

equations studied by Zimmerman and Poisson. Here, we solve the field equations
formally in terms of retarded Green functions, which have explicit
representations as Hadamard forms in the neighbourhood of the world line. Using
a quasi-local expansion of the Hadamard form, we derive the regular solutions
in Fermi normal coordinates according to the Detweiler-Whiting prescription. To
compute the equation of motion, we parameterize the world line in terms of a
mass and ""charge"", which we define in terms of the original Jordan frame mass,
its derivative, and the parameter which translates the proper time in the
Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. These parameters depend on the value of the
background scalar field and its self-field corrections. The equation of motion
which follows from the regular fields strongly resembles the equation for the
self-force acting on a charged, massive particle in a scalarvac geometry of
general relativity. Unlike the scalar vacuum scenario, the ""charge"" parameter
in the scalar-tensor self-force equation is time variable and leading to
additional local and tail terms. We also provide evolution equations for the

established a new observational model analyzing data of the NASA Fermi

of three main emission components: (i) a thermal-like component that we
interpreted so far as the jet photosphere emission, (ii) a non-thermal
component that we interpreted so far as synchrotron radiation, and (iii) an
additional non-thermal (cutoff) power-law most likely of inverse Compton
origin. In this article we reanalyze some of the bright GRBs observed with
CGRO/BATSE with the new model, namely GRBs 941017, 970111 and 990123. We
conclude that BATSE data are fully consistent with the recent results obtained
with Fermi: some bright BATSE GRBs exhibit three separate components during the
prompt phase with similar spectral parameters as these reported from Fermi
data. In addition, the analysis of the BATSE GRBs with the new model results in
a relation between the time-resolved energy flux of the non-thermal component
and its corresponding $\nu$F$_\nu$ peak energy (i.e.,
F$_{i}^{nTh}$-E$_{peak,i}^{nTh}$) that has a similar index as the one initially
derived from Fermi data. For GRBs with known redshift (z) this results in a
possible universal relation between the luminosity of the non-thermal component
and its corresponding $\nu$F$_\nu$ peak energy in the rest frame (i.e.,
L$_{i}^{nTh}$-E$_{peak,i}^{NT,rest}$). We estimated z for GRBs 941017 and
970111 using GRB 990123--with z=1.61--as a reference. The estimated z for GRB
941017 is typical for long GRBs and the estimated z for GRB 970111 is right in

weight transferred to a narrow frequency region just above the gap, the typical
optical signature of a density wave. The AFM phase is marked by strong
increases in both transition temperature and the energy of the gap associated
with the transition. In the normal phase just above the transition the optical
scattering rate varies as $\omega^2$. We find that in both the HO and the AFM

which the HO and the AFM phases are driven by the common physics of a

Multi-Ring Paxos, S-Paxos and HT-Paxos achieve significantly high throughput.
However, to meet the growing demand of high throughput, we are proposing
HT-Ring Paxos, a variant of Paxos that is basically derived from the classical
Paxos. Moreover, it also adopts some fundamental concepts of Ring Paxos,
S-Paxos and HT-Paxos for increasing throughput. Furthermore, HT-Ring Paxos is
best suitable for clustered data centers and achieves comparatively high
throughput among all variants of Paxos. However, similar to Ring Paxos, latency
of the HT-Ring Paxos is quite high as compared with other variants of Paxos.

Medoid-based clustering algorithms, which assume the prototypes of classes are

paper a new prototype-based clustering method, named Evidential C-Medoids
(ECMdd), which is an extension of Fuzzy C-Medoids (FCMdd) on the theoretical

the prototypes to represent the detected classes, including specific classes

objects that may be close to the prototypes of more than one class. This soft

the misclassification rates. Experiments in synthetic and real data sets are
used to illustrate the performance of ECMdd. The results show that ECMdd could
capture well the uncertainty in the internal data structure. Moreover, it is
more robust to the initializations compared with FCMdd.

selected from the SDSS (DR7) and GALEX all-sky survey (GR5), we present a new
empirical calibration for predicting dust extinction of galaxies from
H-alpha-to-FUV flux ratio. We find that the H-alpha dust extinction (A(Ha))
derived with H-alpha/H-beta ratio (Balmer decrement) increases with increasing
H-alpha/UV ratio as expected, but there remains a considerable scatter around
the relation, which is largely dependent on stellar mass and/or H-alpha
equivalent width (EW(Ha)). At fixed H-alpha/UV ratio, galaxies with higher
stellar mass (or galaxies with lower EW(Ha)) tend to be more highly obscured by
dust. We quantify this trend and establish an empirical calibration for
predicting A(Ha) with a combination of H-alpha/UV ratio, stellar mass and
EW(Ha), with which we can successfully reduce the systematic uncertainties
accompanying the simple H-alpha/UV approach by ~15-30%. The new recipes
proposed in this study will provide a convenient tool for predicting dust
extinction level of galaxies particularly when Balmer decrement is not
available. By comparing A(Ha) (derived with Balmer decrement) and A(UV)
(derived with IR/UV luminosity ratio) for a subsample of galaxies for which
AKARI FIR photometry is available, we demonstrate that more massive galaxies
tend to have higher extra extinction towards the nebular regions compared to
the stellar continuum light. Considering recent studies reporting smaller extra
extinction towards nebular regions for high-redshift galaxies, we argue that
the dust geometry within high-redshift galaxies resemble more like low-mass
galaxies in the nearby Universe.

standing challenge for designing mobile devices. This paper presents a novel
solution that seamlessly integrates two technologies, mobile cloud computing
and microwave power transfer (MPT), to enable computation in passive
low-complexity devices such as sensors and wearable computing devices.
Specifically, considering a single-user system, a base station (BS) either
transfers power to or offloads computation from a mobile to the cloud; the
mobile uses harvested energy to compute given data either locally or by
offloading. A framework for energy efficient computing is proposed that
comprises a set of policies for controlling CPU cycles for the mode of local
computing, time division between MPT and offloading for the other mode of
offloading, and mode selection. Given the CPU-cycle statistics information and
channel state information (CSI), the policies aim at maximizing the probability
of successfully computing given data, called computing probability, under the
energy harvesting and deadline constraints. The policy optimization is
translated into the equivalent problems of minimizing the mobile energy
consumption for local computing and maximizing the mobile energy savings for
offloading which are solved using convex optimization theory. The structures of
the resultant policies are characterized in closed form. Furthermore, given
non-causal CSI, the said analytical framework is further developed to support
computation load allocation over multiple channel realizations, which further
increases computing probability. Last, simulation demonstrates the feasibility
of wirelessly powered mobile cloud computing and the gain of its optimal
control.

pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the Dirac equation with a dimensionless

light. In the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. $0<\varepsilon\ll 1$, the
solution exhibits highly oscillatory propagating waves with wavelength
$O(\varepsilon^2)$ and $O(1)$ in time and space, respectively. Due to the rapid
temporal oscillation, it is quite challenging in designing and analyzing
numerical methods with uniform error bounds in $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$. We
present the MTI-FP method based on properly adopting a multiscale decomposition
of the solution of the Dirac equation and applying the exponential wave
integrator with appropriate numerical quadratures. By a careful study of the
error propagation and using the energy method, we establish two independent
error estimates via two different mathematical approaches as
$h^{m_0}+\frac{\tau^2}{\varepsilon^2}$ and $h^{m_0}+\tau^2+\varepsilon^2$,
where $h$ is the mesh size, $\tau$ is the time step and $m_0$ depends on the
regularity of the solution. These two error bounds immediately imply that the
MTI-FP method converges uniformly and optimally in space with exponential
convergence rate if the solution is smooth, and uniformly in time with linear
convergence rate at $O(\tau)$ for all $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ and optimally with
quadratic convergence rate at $O(\tau^2)$ in the regimes when either
$\varepsilon=O(1)$ or $0<\varepsilon\lesssim \tau$. Numerical results are
reported to demonstrate that our error estimates are optimal and sharp.
Finally, the MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically the convergence
rates of the solution of the Dirac equation to those of its limiting models
when $\varepsilon\to0^+$.

chemodynamical simulations and idealised models of their tidal/hydrodynamic
interactions within the 10$^{\rm 13-13.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ group-mass hosts in
which they are preferentially quenched. Our fiducial simulations highlight the
role played by secular star formation and stellar bars, and demonstrate a
transition from a gas-rich to passive, HI-deficient state (i.e.
$\Delta$SFR$\le$-1, def$_{\rm HI}$$\ge$0.5) within 6 Gyr of first infall.
Furthermore, in the 8-10 Gyr in which these systems have typically been
resident within group hosts, the bulge-to-total ratio of an initially bulgeless
disc can increase to 0.3$<$B/T$<$0.4, its specific angular momentum
$\lambda_{\rm R}$ reduce to $\sim$0.5, and strong bisymmetries formed.
Ultimately, this scenario yields satellites resembling dwarf S0s, a result that
holds for a variety of infall inclinations/harassments albeit with broad
scatter. The key assumptions here lie in the rapid removal of the satellite's
gaseous halo upon virial infall, and the satellite's local intra-group medium
density being defined by the host's spherically-averaged profile. We
demonstrate how quenching can be greatly enhanced if the satellite lies in an
overdensity, consistent with recent cosmological-scale simulations but
contrasting with observationally-inferred quenching mechanisms/timescales; an
appraisal of these results with respect to the apparent preferential formation
of dS0s/S0s in groups is also given.

The 1-2 model on the hexagonal lattice is a model of statistical mechanics in
which each vertex is constrained to have degree either 1 or 2. It was proposed
in a study by Schwartz and Bruck of constrained coding systems, and is strongly
connected to the dimer model on a decoration of the lattice, and to an enhanced
Ising model and an associated polygon model on the graph derived from the
hexagonal lattice by adding a further vertex in the middle of each edge.
  The general 1-2 model possesses three parameters $a$, $b$, $c$. The
fundamental technique is to represent probabilities of interest as ratios of
counts of dimer coverings of certain associated graphs, and to apply the
Pfaffian method of Kasteleyn, Fisher, and Temperley.
  Of special interest is the existence (or not) of phase transitions. It turns
out that all clusters of the infinite-volume limit are almost surely finite. On
the other hand, the existence (with strictly positive probability) of infinite
`homogeneous' clusters, containing vertices of given type, depends on the
values of the parameters.
  A further type of phase transition emerges in the study of the two-edge
correlation function, and in this case the critical surface may be found
explicitly. For instance, when $a \ge b \ge c > 0$, the surface given by $\sqrt
a = \sqrt b + \sqrt c$ is critical.

distribution functions (DFs) expressed in terms of the actions. These provide
triaxial density profiles with cores or cusps at the centre. They are the first
self-consistent triaxial models with analytic DFs suitable for modelling giant
ellipticals and dark haloes. Specifically, we study triaxial models that
reproduce the Hernquist profile from Williams & Evans (2015), as well as
flattened isochrones of the form proposed by Binney (2014). We explore the
kinematics and orbital structure of these models in some detail. The models
typically become more radially anisotropic on moving outwards, have velocity
ellipsoids aligned in Cartesian coordinates in the centre and aligned in
spherical polar coordinates in the outer parts.
  In projection, the ellipticity of the isophotes and the position angle of the
major axis of our models generally changes with radius. So, a natural
application is to elliptical galaxies that exhibit isophote twisting. As
triaxial St\""ackel models do not show isophote twists, our DFs are the first to
generate mass density distributions that do exhibit this phenomenon, typically
with a gradient of $\approx 10^\circ$/effective radius, which is comparable to
the data.
  Triaxiality is a natural consequence of models that are susceptible to the
radial orbit instability. We show how a family of spherical models with
anisotropy profiles that transition from isotropic at the centre to radially
anisotropic becomes unstable when the outer anisotropy is made sufficiently
radial. Models with a larger outer anisotropy can be constructed but are found
to be triaxial. We argue that the onset of the radial orbit instability can be
identified with the transition point when adiabatic relaxation yields strongly
triaxial rather than weakly spherical endpoints.

important to characterize the central output parameters. Of specific importance
are pulse-to-pulse (shot-to-shot) fluctuations of the high-harmonic output
energy, fluctuations of the direction of the emission (pointing instabilities),
and fluctuations of the beam divergence and shape that reduce the spatial
coherence. We present the first single-shot measurements of waveguided
high-harmonic generation in a waveguided (capillary-based) geometry. Using a
capillary waveguide filled with Argon gas as the nonlinear medium, we provide
the first characterization of shot-to-shot fluctuations of the pulse energy, of
the divergence and of the beam pointing. We record the strength of these
fluctuations vs. two basic input parameters, which are the drive laser pulse
energy and the gas pressure in the capillary waveguide. In correlation
measurements between single-shot drive laser beam profiles and single-shot
high-harmonic beam profiles we prove the absence of drive laser
beam-pointing-induced fluctuations in the high-harmonic output. We attribute
the main source of high-harmonic fluctuations to ionization-induced nonlinear
mode mixing during propagation of the drive laser pulse inside the capillary

of exogenous shocks to individual institutions and the macroprudential risks
caused by their systemic interactions. We investigate a simple dynamical model
for understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target
and an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with
clustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable
region, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a
locally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior; and
(iii) a globally unstable region. A crude calibration of parameters to data
puts the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price
bubble, resembling a ""Great Moderation"", followed by a crash, with a period of
approximately 10-15 years, which we dub the ""Basel leverage cycle"". We propose
a criterion for rating macroprudential policies based on their ability to
minimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family
of leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of
Basel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to
countercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases.
We find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average
leverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the
fundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal
when the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the
opposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy
is closer to constant leverage. We also find that systemic risk can be
dramatically decreased by lowering the leverage target adjustment speed of the
banks.

evolutionary yields of elements such as CNO and the corresponding observed
chemical abundances is a powerful tool to shed light on evolutionary processes
such as hot bottom burning (HBB) and third dredge-up (TDU). We found that the
occurrence of HBB is needed to interpret the nitrogen-enriched (log(N/H)+12>8)
PNe. In particular, N-rich PNe with the lowest carbon content are nicely
reproduced by AGB models of mass M >=6 Mo, whose surface chemistry reflects the
pure effects of HBB. PNe with log(N/H)+12<7.5 correspond to ejecta of stars
that have not experienced HBB, with initial mass below about 3 Mo. Some of
these stars show very large carbon abundances, owing to the many TDU episodes
experienced. We found from our LMC PN sample that there is a threshold to the
amount of carbon accumulated at AGB surfaces, log(C/H)+12<9. Confirmation of
this constraint would indicate that, after the C-star stage is reached,AGBs
experience only a few thermal pulses, which suggests a rapid loss of the
external mantle, probably owing to the effects of radiation pressure on
carbonaceous dust particles present in the circumstellar envelope. The
implications of these findings for AGB evolution theories and the need to
extend the PN sample currently available are discussed.

780-14), quantum and classical uncertainties for dimensionless variables of
position and momentum were evaluated in three potentials: infinite well,
bouncing ball, and harmonic oscillator. While original quantum uncertainty
products depend on ${\rm{\hbar}}$ and the number of states ($n$), a
dimensionless approach makes the comparison between quantum uncertainty and
classical dispersion possible by excluding ${\rm{\hbar}}$. But the question is
whether the uncertainty still remains dependent on quantum number $n$. In the
above-mentioned article, there lies this contrast, on the one hand, the
dimensionless quantum uncertainty of the potential box approaches classical
dispersion only in the limit of large quantum numbers ($n\to \infty
$)-consistent with the correspondence principle. On the other hand, similar
evaluations for bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal to
their classical counterparts independent of $n$. This equality may hide the
quantum feature of low energy levels. In the current study, we change the
potential intervals in order to make them symmetric for the linear potential
and non-symmetric for the quadratic potential. As a result, it is shown in this
paper that the dimensionless quantum uncertainty of these potentials in the new
potential intervals is expressed in terms of quantum number $n$. In other
words, the uncertainty requires the correspondence principle in order to
approach the classical limit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
dimensionless analysis, as a useful pedagogical method, does not take away the
quantum feature of the n-dependence of quantum uncertainty in general.
Moreover, our numerical calculations include the higher powers of the position
for the potentials.

formalism which conserves exactly the particle number and the isospin. The
formalism is designed for self-conjugate (N=Z) systems of nucleons moving in
axially deformed mean fields and interacting through the most general isovector
and isoscalar pairing interactions. The ground state of these systems is
described by a superposition of two types of condensates, i.e., condensates of
isovector quartets, built by two isovector pairs coupled to the total isospin
T=0, and condensates of isoscalar proton-neutron pairs. The comparison with the
exact solutions of realistic isovector-isoscalar pairing Hamiltonians shows
that this ansatz for the ground state is able to describe with high precision
the pairing correlation energies. It is also shown that, at variance with the
majority of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations, in the present formalism the
isovector and isoscalar pairing correlations coexist for any pairing
interactions. The competition between the isovector and isoscalar
proton-neutron pairing correlations is studied for N=Z nuclei with the valence
nucleons moving in the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and in the major shell above

isoscalar pairing, especially for heavier nuclei. However, the isoscalar
proton-neutron correlations are significant in all nuclei and they always

ultimate sensitivity with the possibility to create very large detector arrays,
in excess of 10 000 pixels. This is possible by reading-out the arrays using RF
frequency division multiplexing, which allows multiplexing ratios in excess of
1000 pixels per readout line. We describe a novel readout system for large
arrays of MKIDs, operating in a 2 GHz band in the 4-8 GHz range. The readout,
which is a combination of a digital front- and back-end and an analog up- and
down-converter system, can read out up to 4000 detectors simultaneously with 1
kHz datarate. The system achieves a readout noise power spectral density of -98
dBc/Hz while reading 1000 carriers simultaneously, which scales linear with the

cluster (GC) NGC 2419. A detailed analysis of the composite HB highlights three
populations:(1) the blue luminous HB, hosting standard helium stars (Y=0.25)
with a very small spread of mass, (2) a small population of stars with
intermediate helium content (0.26<Y<=0.29), and (3) the well-populated extreme
HB. We can fit the last group with models having high helium abundance (Y \sim
0.36), half of which (the hottest part, 'blue hook' stars) are identified as
possible 'late flash mixed stars'. The initial helium abundance of this extreme
population is in nice agreement with the predicted helium abundance in the
ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of the same metallicity
as NGC 2419. This result further supports the hypothesis that second-generation
stars in GCs formed from the ashes of intermediate-mass AGB stars. We find that
the distribution in magnitude of the blue hook stars is larger than that
predicted by theoretical models. We discuss the possible uncertainties in the
magnitude scales and different attempts to model this group of stars. Finally,
we suggest that consistency can be better achieved if we assume core masses
larger than predicted by our models. This may be possible if the progenitors
were fast rotators on the main sequence. If further study confirms this
interpretation, a fast initial rotation would be a strong signature of the
peculiarity of extreme second-generation stars in GCs.

and analytical analyses of modified 8-chain Arruda-Boyce model for cross-linked
polymer networks. This class of models has proved highly successful in modeling
the finite-strain response of flexible rubbers. We extend it to include the
effects of spatial disorder and the associated non-affinity, and use it to
assess the validity of replacing the constituent chain's nonlinear elastic
response with equivalent linear, Hookean springs. Surprisingly, we find that
even in the regime of linear response, the full polymer model gives very
different results from its linearized counterpart, even though none of the
chains are stretched beyond their linear regime. We demonstrate that this
effect is due to the fact that the polymer models are under considerable
pre-stress in their ground state. We show that pre-stress strongly suppresses
non-affinity in these unit cell models, resulting in a marked stiffening of the
bulk response. The effects of pre-stress we discuss may explain why fully
affine mechanical models, in many cases, predict the bulk mechanical response
of disordered stiff polymer networks so well.

parameter couples linearly to elastic degrees of freedom are reviewed with

of these transitions is the suppression of critical fluctuations by long-range
shear forces. As a consequence, at an elastic crystal symmetry-breaking quantum
phase transition the phonon velocity vanishes only along certain
crystallographic directions giving rise to critical phonon thermodynamics
described by a stable Gaussian fixed point. At an isostructural solid-solid
quantum critical end point, on the other hand, the complete suppression of
critical fluctuations results in true mean-field critical behavior without a
diverging correlation length. Whenever an order parameter couples bilinearly to
the strain tensor, the critical properties are eventually governed by critical
crystal elasticity. This is, for example, the case for quantum critical
metamagnetism but also for the classical critical Mott end point at finite $T$.

hole's entropy or information flow is similar to that through one-dimensional
channel. Here I analyse the same issue with the use of gravitational anomalies.
The rate of the entropy change ($\dot{S}$) and the power ($P$) of the Hawking
emission are calculated from the relevant components of the anomalous
stress-tensor under the Unruh vacuum condition. I show that the dependence of
$\dot{S}$ on power is $\dot{S}\propto P^{1/2}$ which is identical to that for
the information flow in one dimensional system. This is established by using
the ($1+1$) dimensional gravitational anomalies first. Then the fact is further
bolstered by considering the ($1+3$) dimensional gravitational anomalies. It is
found that in the former case, the proportionality constant is exactly
identical to one dimensional situation, known as Pendry's formula, while in
later situation its value decreases.

Tauri stars from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS). RV Tauri stars
are the brightest among the population II Cepheids. They are thought to evolve
away from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) towards the white dwarf domain.
IRAS detected several RV Tauri stars because of their large IR excesses and it
was found that they occupy a specific region in the [12] - [25], [25] - [60]
IRAS two-colour diagram. We used the all sky survey of WISE to extend these
studies and compare the infrared properties of all RV Tauri stars in the GCVS
with a selected sample of post-AGB objects with the goal to place the RV Tauri
pulsators in the context of post-AGB evolution. Moreover, we correlated the IR
properties of both the RV Tauri stars and the comparison sample with other
observables like binarity and the presence of a photospheric chemical anomaly
called depletion. We find that Galactic RV Tauri stars display a range of
infrared properties and we differentiate between disc sources, objects with no
IR excess and objects for which the spectral energy distribution (SED) is
uncertain. We obtain a clear correlation between disc sources and binarity. RV
Tauri stars with a variable mean magnitude are exclusively found among the disc
sources. We also find evidence for disc evolution among the binaries.
Furthermore our studies show that the presence of a disc seems to be a
necessary but not sufficient condition for the depletion process to become
efficient.

reconstruct the transmission trees linking infectors and infectees in
outbreaks. However, transmission trees from one outbreak do not generalize to
future outbreaks. Reconstruction of transmission trees is most useful to public
health if it leads to generalizable scientific insights about disease
transmission. In a survival analysis framework, estimation of transmission
parameters is based on sums or averages over the possible transmission trees. A
phylogeny can increase the precision of these estimates by providing partial
information about who infected whom. The leaves of the phylogeny represent
sampled pathogens, which have known hosts. The interior nodes represent common
ancestors of sampled pathogens, which have unknown hosts. Starting from
assumptions about disease biology and epidemiologic study design, we prove that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the possible assignments of
interior node hosts and the transmission trees simultaneously consistent with
the phylogeny and the epidemiologic data on person, place, and time. We develop
algorithms to enumerate these transmission trees and show these can be used to
calculate likelihoods that incorporate both epidemiologic data and a phylogeny.
A simulation study confirms that this leads to more efficient estimates of
hazard ratios for infectiousness and baseline hazards of infectious contact,
and we use these methods to analyze data from a foot-and-mouth disease virus
outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001. These results demonstrate the
importance of data on individuals who escape infection, which is often
overlooked. The combination of survival analysis and algorithms linking
phylogenies to transmission trees is a rigorous but flexible statistical
foundation for molecular infectious disease epidemiology.

an important step towards building a universal framework for non-equilibrium
steady states akin to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for equilibrium systems.
In this review, we consider one-dimensional bulk-driven particle gases, and in
particular the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open boundaries,
which is one of the most popular models of one-dimensional transport. We focus,
in particular, on the current of particles flowing through the system in its
steady state, and on its fluctuations. We show how one can obtain the complete
statistics of that current, through its large deviation function, by combining
results from various methods: exact calculation of the cumulants of the
current, using the integrability of the model ; direct diagonalisation of a
biased process in the limits of very high or low current ; hydrodynamic
description of the model in the continuous limit using the macroscopic
fluctuation theory (MFT). We give a pedagogical account of these techniques,
starting with a quick introduction to the necessary mathematical tools, as well
as a short overview of the existing works relating to the ASEP. We conclude by
drawing the complete dynamical phase diagram of the current. We also remark on
a few possible generalisations of these results.

along 12 lines and located deep underwater in the Mediterranean Sea. It
searches for astrophysical neutrinos collecting the Cherenkov light induced by
the charged particles, mainly muons, produced in neutrino interactions around
the detector. Since at energies of $\sim$10 TeV the muon and the incident
neutrino are almost collinear, it is possible to use the ANTARES detector as a
neutrino telescope and identify a source of neutrinos in the sky starting from
a precise reconstruction of the muon trajectory. To get this result, the
arrival times of the Cherenkov photons must be accurately measured. A to
perform time calibrations with the precision required to have optimal
performances of the instrument is described. The reconstructed tracks of the
atmospheric muons in the ANTARES detector are used to determine the relative
time offsets between photomultipliers. Currently, this method is used to obtain
the time calibration constants for photomultipliers on different lines at a
precision level of 0.5 ns. It has also been validated for calibrating
photomultipliers on the same line, using a system of LEDs and laser light
devices.

$T_s$ ($T_N\leq T_s$), a uniaxial pressure necessary to detwin the sample also
increases $T_N$, smears out the structural transition, and induces an
orthorhombic lattice distortion at all temperatures. By comparing temperature
and doping dependence of the pressure induced lattice parameter changes with
the elastoresistance and nematic susceptibility obtained from transport and
ultrasonic measurements, we conclude that the in-plane resistivity anisotropy
found in the paramagnetic state of electron underdoped iron pnictides depends
sensitively on the nature of the magnetic phase transition and a strong
coupling between the uniaxial pressure induced lattice distortion and
electronic nematic susceptibility.

  Influence",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0135740",,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contagion, a concept from epidemiology, has long been used to characterize
social influence on people's behavior and affective (emotional) states. While
it has revealed many useful insights, it is not clear whether the contagion
metaphor is sufficient to fully characterize the complex dynamics of
psychological states in a social context. Using wearable sensors that capture
daily face-to-face interaction, combined with three daily experience sampling
surveys, we collected the most comprehensive data set of personality and
emotion dynamics of an entire community of work. From this high-resolution data
about actual (rather than self-reported) face-to-face interaction, a complex
picture emerges where contagion (that can be seen as adaptation of behavioral
responses to the behavior of other people) cannot fully capture the dynamics of
transitory states. We found that social influence has two opposing effects on
states: \emph{adaptation} effects that go beyond mere contagion, and
\emph{complementarity} effects whereby individuals' behaviors tend to
complement the behaviors of others. Surprisingly, these effects can exhibit
completely different directions depending on the stable personality or
emotional dispositions (stable traits) of target individuals. Our findings
provide a foundation for richer models of social dynamics, and have
implications on organizational engineering and workplace well-being.

provide a new solution of the dimer model in terms of the model of critical
dense polymers on a tilted lattice and offer an understanding of the lattice
integrability of the dimer model. The dimer transfer matrix is analysed in the
scaling limit and the result for $L_0-\frac c{24}$ is expressed in terms of
fermions. Higher Virasoro modes are likewise constructed as limits of elements
of $TL_n$ and are found to yield a $c=-2$ realisation of the Virasoro algebra,
familiar from fermionic $bc$ ghost systems. In this realisation, the dimer Fock
spaces are shown to decompose, as Virasoro modules, into direct sums of
Feigin-Fuchs modules, themselves exhibiting reducible yet indecomposable
structures. In the scaling limit, the eigenvalues of the lattice integrals of
motion are found to agree exactly with those of the $c=-2$ conformal integrals
of motion. Consistent with the expression for $L_0-\frac c{24}$ obtained from
the transfer matrix, we also construct higher Virasoro modes with $c=1$ and
find that the dimer Fock space is completely reducible under their action.
However, the transfer matrix is found not to be a generating function for the
$c=1$ integrals of motion. Although this indicates that Lieb's transfer matrix
description is incompatible with the $c=1$ interpretation, it does not rule out
the existence of an alternative, $c=1$ compatible, transfer matrix description
of the dimer model.

mechanism underlying RD designs, by re-formulating the Stable Unit Treatment
Value Assumption (SUTVA) and making an explicit local overlap assumption for a
subpopulation around the threshold. A local randomization assumption is invoked
instead of more standard continuity assumptions. We also develop a model-based
Bayesian approach to select the target subpopulation(s) with adjustment for
multiple comparisons, and to draw inference for the target causal estimands in
this framework. Applying the method to the data from two Italian universities,
we find evidence that university grants are effective in preventing students

that C$_2$H might be transformed to other species owing to increased
temperature and density; thus, its reduced abundance could be the signpost of

magnetic moment relative to the light polarization. It was revealed that the
local magnetic properties in the vicinity of the excited Nd3+ ion substantially
depended on its state. In particular, in some excited states a weak
ferromagnetic moment appears, the field induced reorientation magnetic
transitions occur and the changes of the local magnetic anisotropy type take
place. In some excited states the nonequivalent Nd3+ centers were found out.

conformally coupled scalar field. The $su(1,1)$ hidden symmetries of this

system suffer from severe pilot contamination, which leads to poor quality of

reuse (SPR) combined with multi-cell block diagonalization (MBD) precoding are
proposed. Specifically, the users are divided into two groups according to
their large-scale fading coefficients, referred to as the center users, who
only suffer from modest pilot contamination and the edge users, who suffer from
severe pilot contamination. Based on this distinction, the SPR scheme is
proposed for improving the QoS for the edge users, whereby a cell-center pilot
group is reused for all cell-center users in all cells, while a cell-edge pilot
group is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells. By extending the
classical block diagonalization precoding to a multi-cell scenario, the MBD
precoding scheme projects the downlink transmit signal onto the null space of
the subspace spanned by the inter-cell channels of the edge users in adjacent
cells. Thus, the inter-cell interference contaminating the edge users' signals
in the adjacent cells can be efficiently mitigated and hence the QoS of these
edge users can be further enhanced. Our theoretical analysis and simulation
results demonstrate that both the uplink and downlink rates of the edge users
are significantly improved, albeit at the cost of the slightly decreased rate
of center users.

that (asymptotically) no long splitting chains implies solvability and
uniqueness of limit models implies no long splitting chains. Using known

definitions (and more) are equivalent:
  $\mathbf{Corollary}$
  Let $K$ be a tame AEC with a monster model. Assume that $K$ is stable in a
proper class of cardinals. The following are equivalent:
  1) For all high-enough $\lambda$, $K$ has no long splitting chains.
  2) For all high-enough $\lambda$, there exists a good $\lambda$-frame on a
skeleton of $K_\lambda$.
  3) For all high-enough $\lambda$, $K$ has a unique limit model of cardinality
$\lambda$.
  4) For all high-enough $\lambda$, $K$ has a superlimit model of cardinality
$\lambda$.
  5) For all high-enough $\lambda$, the union of any increasing chain of
$\lambda$-saturated models is $\lambda$-saturated.
  6) There exists $\mu$ such that for all high-enough $\lambda$, $K$ is
$(\lambda, \mu)$-solvable.
  This gives evidence that there is a clear notion of superstability in the
framework of tame AECs with a monster model.

important solar Fe I lines are important due to the strong sensitivity of Fe I
to ionizing UV radiation, which may lead to a considerable under-population of
the Fe I levels in the solar atmosphere and, therefore, to a sizeable weakening
of Fe I lines. Such NLTE effects may be intensified or weakened by horizontal
radiative transfer (RT) in a three-dimensionally (3-D) structured atmosphere.
We analyze the influence of horizontal RT on commonly used Fe I lines in a
snapshot of a 3-D radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a plage
region. NLTE- and horizontal RT effects occur with considerable strength (up to
50% in line depth or equivalent width) in the analyzed snapshot. As they may
have either sign and both signs occur with approximately the same frequency and
strength, the net effects are small when considering spatially averaged
quantities. The situation in the plage atmosphere turns out to be rather
complex. Horizontal transfer leads to line-weakening relative to 1-D NLTE
transfer near the boundaries of kG magnetic elements. Around the centers of
these elements, however, we find an often significant line-strengthening. This
behavior is in contrast to that expected from previous 3-D RT computations in
idealized flux-tube models, which display only a line weakening. The origin of
this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that magnetic elements are surrounded
by dense and relatively cool down-flowing gas, which forms the walls of the
magnetic elements. The continuum in these dense walls is often formed in colder
gas than in the central part of the magnetic elements. Consequently, the
central parts of the magnetic element experience a sub-average UV-irradiation
leading to the observed 3-D NLTE line strengthening.

tasks, and this paper explores how the pairwise geometry of subspaces
influences the probability of misclassification. When the mismatch between the
signal and the model is vanishingly small, the probability of misclassification
is determined by the product of the sines of the principal angles between
subspaces. When the mismatch is more significant, the probability of
misclassification is determined by the sum of the squares of the sines of the
principal angles. Reliability of classification is derived in terms of the
distribution of signal energy across principal vectors. Larger principal angles
lead to smaller classification error, motivating a linear transform that
optimizes principal angles. The transform presented here (TRAIT) preserves some
specific characteristic of each individual class, and this approach is shown to
be complementary to a previously developed transform (LRT) that enlarges
inter-class distance while suppressing intra-class dispersion. Theoretical
results are supported by demonstration of superior classification accuracy on
synthetic and measured data even in the presence of significant model mismatch.

Brissaud et al. (2004). The radiative transfer model assumes an isotropization
of the flux after the second interface and is fully described in Andrieu et al.
(2015). Two kind of experiments were conducted. First, the specular spot was
closely investigated, at high angular resolution, at the wavelength of
$1.5\,\mbox{\mu m}$, where ice behaves as a very absorbing media. Second, the
bidirectional reflectance was sampled at various geometries, including low
phase angles on 61 wavelengths ranging from $0.8\,\mbox{\mu m}$ to
$2.0\,\mbox{\mu m}$.
  In order to validate the model, we made a qualitative test to demonstrate the
relative isotropization of the flux. We also conducted quantitative assessments
by using a bayesian inversion method in order to estimate the parameters (e.g.
sample thickness, surface roughness) from the radiative measurements only. A
simple comparison between the retrieved parameters and the direct independent
measurements allowed us to validate the model.
  We developed an innovative bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively
estimate the uncertainties on the parameters avoiding the usual slow Monte
Carlo approach. First we built lookup tables, and then searched the best fits
and calculated a posteriori density probability functions. The results show
that the model is able to reproduce the spectral behavior of water ice slabs,
as well as the specular spot. In addition, the different parameters of the
model are compatible with independent measurements.

set of points. This property, which leads to vanishing Lyapunov exponents, is
designed to mimic diffusion in non-chaotic polygonal billiards that give rise
to normal and anomalous diffusion in a fully deterministic setting. As these
billiards are typically too complicated to be analyzed from first principles,
simplified models are needed to identify the minimal ingredients generating the
different transport regimes. For our model, which we call the slicer map, we
calculate all its moments in position analytically under variation of a single
control parameter. We show that the slicer map exhibits a transition from
subdiffusion over normal diffusion to superdiffusion under parameter variation.
Our results may help to understand the delicate parameter dependence of the
type of diffusion generated by polygonal billiards. We argue that in different
parameter regions the transport properties of our simple model match to
different classes of known stochastic processes. This may shed light on
difficulties to match diffusion in polygonal billiards to a single anomalous

provide several important insights for practical system design. More
specifically, for regular MIMO systems with hardware impairments, there is

that the achievable rate loss depends on the Rician $K$-factor, which reveals
that the favorable propagation in LS-MIMO systems can remove the influence of

step is to construct a complex network of microstates from detailed atomistic

coarse-graining is then carried out in the cycle space of this network. To this
end we introduce the concept of representatives, which stand for many cycles

inhomogeneous curvature of the model parameters space. We then provide a way
for rectifying this space which relies only on dataset properties and does not
require large computational efforts. We conclude by solving the long-time limit
of the parameters dynamics including the randomness generated by the systematic
use of Gibbs sampling. In this stochastic framework, rather than converging to
a fixed point, the dynamics reaches a stationary distribution, which for the
rectified dynamics reproduces the posterior distribution of the parameters.
  We sum up all these insights in a ""rectified"" Data-Driven algorithm that is
fast and by sampling from the parameters posterior avoids both under- and
over-fitting along all the directions of the parameters space. Through the

and anisotropy of the universe, triggered by the ongoing process of structure
formation. As a result, realistic observers do not follow the smooth Hubble
flow but have a peculiar, `tilt', velocity relative to it. Our Local Group of
galaxies, in particular, moves with respect to the universal expansion at a
speed of roughly 600~km/sec. Relative motion effects are known to interfere
with the observations and their interpretation. The strong dipolar anisotropy
seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background, for example, is not treated as a sign
of real universal anisotropy, but as a mere artifact of our peculiar motion
relative to the Hubble flow. With these in mind, we look into the implications
of large-scale bulk motions for the kinematics of their associated observers,
by adopting a `tilted' Friedmann model. Our aim is to examine whether the
deceleration parameter measured in the rest-frame of the bulk flow can differ
from that of the actual universe due to relative-motion effects alone. We find
that there is a difference, which depends on the speed as well as the scale of
the bulk motion. The faster and the smaller the drifting domain, the larger the
difference. In principle, this allows relatively slow peculiar velocities to
have a disproportionately strong effect on the value of the deceleration
parameter measured by observers within bulk flows of, say, few hundred
megaparsecs. In fact, under certain circumstances, it is even possible to
change the sign of the deceleration parameter. It goes without saying that all
these effects vanish identically in the Hubble frame, which makes then an
illusion and mere artifact of the observers' relative motion.

individual rather than a large space, thus providing personal thermal comfort
while supplementing cooling loads in thermally regulated environments. This can
lead to significant energy and cost savings. In this study, a new approach to
personal cooling was developed using an infrared-transparent visible-opaque
fabric (ITVOF), which provides passive cooling via the transmission of thermal
radiation emitted by the human body directly to the environment. Here, we
present a conceptual framework to thermally and optically design an ITVOF.
Using a heat transfer model, the fabric was found to require a minimum infrared
(IR) transmittance of 0.644 and a maximum IR reflectance of 0.2 to ensure
thermal comfort at ambient temperatures as high as 26.1oC (79oF). To meet these
requirements, an ITVOF design was developed using synthetic polymer fibers with
an intrinsically low IR absorptance. These fibers were then structured to
minimize IR reflection via weak Rayleigh scattering while maintaining visible
opaqueness via strong Mie scattering. For a fabric composed of parallel-aligned

diameter fibers bundled into 30 {\mu}m yarns can achieve a total hemispherical
IR transmittance of 0.972, which is nearly perfectly transparent to mid- and
far-IR radiation. The visible wavelength properties of the ITVOF are comparable
to conventional textiles ensuring opaqueness to the human eye. By providing
personal cooling in a form amenable to everyday use, ITVOF-based clothing
offers a simple, low-cost solution to reduce energy consumption in HVAC

replaces hot electrons by cold ones. The central idea is that a double quantum
dot with an inhomogeneous Zeeman splitting acts as energy filter for the
transported electrons. The setup is such that hot electrons with spin up are
removed, while cold electrons with spin down are added. The required
non-equilibrium condition is provided by the capacitive coupling of one quantum
dot to the shot noise of a strongly biased quantum point contact in the
tunnelling limit. Special attention is paid to the identification of an
operating regime in which the net electrical current vanishes.

Peninsula (Russia) close to Finnish border on April 19, 2014 (local time). The
fireball was instrumentally observed by the Finnish Fireball Network. From
these observations the strewnfield was computed and two first meteorites were
found only a few hundred meters from the predicted landing site on May 29th and
May 30th 2014, so that the meteorite (an H4-5 chondrite) experienced only
minimal terrestrial alteration. The accuracy of the observations allowed a
precise geocentric radiant to be obtained, and the heliocentric orbit for the
progenitor meteoroid to be calculated. Backward integrations of the orbits of
selected near-Earth asteroids and the Annama meteoroid showed that they rapidly
diverged so that the Annama meteorites are unlikely related to them. The only
exception seems to be the recently discovered 2014UR116 that shows a plausible
dynamic relationship. Instead, analysis of the heliocentric orbit of the
meteoroid suggests that the delivery of Annama onto an Earth-crossing Apollo
type orbit occurred via the 4:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter or the nu6
secular resonance, dynamic mechanisms that are responsible for delivering to
Earth most meteorites studied so far.

using $\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter obtained from density dependent M3Y
effective interaction. The transition density, pressure and proton fraction at
the inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust of the neutron
stars determined from the thermodynamic stability conditions are found to be
$\rho_t=$ 0.0938 fm$^{-3}$, P$_t=$ 0.5006 MeV fm$^{-3}$ and $x_{p(t)}=$ 0.0308,
respectively. The crustal fraction of the moment of inertia can be extracted
from studying pulsar glitches and is most sensitive to the pressure as well as
density at the transition from the crust to the core. These results for
pressure and density at core-crust transition together with the observed
minimum crustal fraction of the total moment of inertia provide a new limit for
the radius of the Vela pulsar: $R \geq 4.10 + 3.36 M/M_\odot$ kms.

general characteristics of ecosystems including pathway proliferation, and
network non-locality, homogenization, amplification, mutualism, and synergism.
Collectively these properties characterize the impact of indirect interactions
among ecosystem elements. While ecosystem networks generally trace a
thermodynamically conserved unit through the system, there appear to be several
model classes. For example, trophic (TRO) networks are built upon a food web,
usually follow energy or carbon, and are the most abundant in the literature.
Biogeochemical cycling (BGC) networks trace nutrients like nitrogen or
phosphorus and tend to have more recycling than TRO. We tested (1) the
hypothesized generality of the properties in BGC networks and (2) that they
tend to be more strongly expressed in BGC networks than in the TRO networks due
to increased recycling. We compared the properties in 22 BGC and 57 TRO
ecosystem networks from the literature using enaR. The results generally
support the hypotheses. First, five of the properties occurred in all 22 BGC
models, while network mutualism occurred in 86% of the models. Further, these
results were generally robust to a $\pm$50% uncertainty in the model
parameters. Second, the mean network statistics for the six properties were
statistically significantly greater in the BGC models than the TRO models.
These results (1) confirm the general presence of these properties in ecosystem
networks, (2) highlight the significance of model types in determining property
intensities, (3) reinforce the importance of recycling, and (4) provide a set
of indicator benchmarks for future systems comparisons. Further, this work
highlights how indirect effects distributed by network connectivity can
transform whole-ecosystem functioning, and adds to the growing domain of
network ecology.

characteristics in human cancers, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are
resistant to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy owing to their high DNA
repair ability and oncogene overexpression. However, the mechanisms regulating
CSC radio-resistance, particularly proton beam resistance, remain unclear. We
isolated CSCs from the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, which
expressed the characteristic breast CSC membrane protein markers
CD44+/CD24-/low, and irradiated the CSCs with pulsed proton beams. We confirmed
that CSCs are resistant to pulsed proton beams and showed that treatment with
p38 and ERK inhibitors reduced CSC radioresistance. Based on these results,
BCSC radio-resistance can be reduced during proton beam therapy by co-treatment
with ERK1/2 or p38 inhibitors, representing a novel approach for breast cancer
therapy.
