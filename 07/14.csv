reduced by assigning drivers to parking lots based on their destination and
arrival time. In such a system, drivers could request a parking spot in advance
and be alerted (e.g., via their phone or vehicle) of their assignment to a
specific parking lot or available spot. In this paper, a parking assignment
system is described to allocate parking spaces in a fair and equitable manner.
Heuristics are developed to solve the underlying large scale optimization
problem. The efficacy of the system is demonstrated by applying our algorithms
to real data sets.

  Ray Conference (ICRC 2015), The Hague (The Netherlands)",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cosmic rays up to at least PeV energies are usually described in the
framework of an elementary scenario that involves acceleration by objects that
are located in the disk of the Milky Way, such as supernova remnants or massive
star-forming regions, and then diffusive propagation throughout the Galaxy.
Details of the propagation process are so far inferred mainly from the
composition of cosmic rays measured near the Earth and then extrapolated to the
whole Galaxy. The details of the propagation in the Galactic halo and the
escape into the intergalactic medium remain uncertain. The densities of cosmic
rays in specific locations can be traced via the gamma rays they produce in
inelastic collisions with clouds of interstellar gas. Therefore, we analyze 73
months of Fermi-LAT data from 300 MeV to 10 GeV in the direction of several
high- and intermediate-velocity clouds that are located in the halo of the
Milky Way. These clouds are supposed to be free of internal sources of cosmic
rays and hence any gamma-ray emission from them samples the large-scale
distribution of Galactic cosmic rays. We evaluate for the first time the
gamma-ray emissivity per hydrogen atom up to ~7 kpc above the Galactic disk.
The emissivity is found to decrease with distance from the disk, which provides
direct evidence that cosmic rays at the relevant energies originate therein.
Furthermore, the emissivity of one of the targets, the upper
intermediate-velocity Arch, hints at a 50% decline of the cosmic-ray intensity
within 2 kpc from the disk.

the multiple branes satisfy the intersection rule and feel no force when they

2D) moves in a free space so as to always locally minimize its Euclidean
distance to an activated beacon (which is also a point). This results in the
robot moving directly towards the beacon when it can, and otherwise sliding
along the edge of an obstacle. When a robot can reach the activated beacon by
this method, we say that the beacon attracts the robot. A beacon routing from
$p$ to $q$ is a sequence $b_1, b_2,$ ..., $b_{k}$ of beacons such that
activating the beacons in order will attract a robot from $p$ to $b_1$ to $b_2$

defined over binary genotype sequences of length $L$. We consider greedy
adaptive walks in which the population moves to the fittest among all single
mutant neighbors of the current genotype until a local fitness maximum is
reached. The landscape is of the rough mount Fuji type, which means that the
fitness value assigned to a sequence is the sum of a random and a deterministic
component. The random components are independent and identically distributed
random variables, and the deterministic component varies linearly with the
distance to a reference sequence. The deterministic fitness gradient $c$ is a
parameter that interpolates between the limits of an uncorrelated random
landscape ($c = 0$) and an effectively additive landscape ($c \to \infty$).
When the random fitness component is chosen from the Gumbel distribution,
explicit expressions for the distribution of the number of steps taken by the
greedy walk are obtained, and it is shown that the walk length varies
non-monotonically with the strength of the fitness gradient when the starting
point is sufficiently close to the reference sequence. Asymptotic results for
general distributions of the random fitness component are obtained using
extreme value theory, and it is found that the walk length attains a
non-trivial limit for $L \to \infty$, different from its values for $c=0$ and
$c = \infty$, if $c$ is scaled with $L$ in an appropriate combination.

""asymmetric"" excited initial condition. We show that in the limit where the
deviations from the Bunch-Davies vacuum is large and the scale of new physics
is maximally separated from the inflationary Hubble parameter, the primordial
power spectrum is modulated only by position dependent dipole and quadrupole
terms. Requiring the dipole contribution in the power spectrum to account for
the observed power asymmetry, $A=0.07\pm0.022$, we show that the amount of
quadrupole terms is roughly equal to $A^2$. The {\it mean} local bispectrum,
which gets enhanced for the excited initial state, is within the $1\sigma$
bound of Planck 2015 results for a large field model, $f_{\rm NL}\simeq 4.17$,
but is reachable by future CMB experiments. The amplitude of the local
non-gaussianity modulates around this mean value, depending on the angle that
the correlated patches on the 2d CMB surface make with the preferred direction.
The amount of variation minimizes for the configuration in which the short and
long wavelengths modes are around the preferred pole and $|\vec k_3|\approx
|\vec k_{l\approx10}|\ll |\vec k_1|\approx |\vec k_2|\approx |\vec
k_{l\approx2500}|$ with $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm min}\approx 3.64 $. The maximum occurs
when these modes are at the antipode of the preferred pole, $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm
max}\approx 4.81$ . The difference of non-gaussianity between these two
configurations is as large as $\simeq 1.17$ which can be used to distinguish
this scenario from other scenarios that try to explain the observed
hemispherical asymmetry.

help improve systems and operational practices to avoid incidents in the
future. We analyzed the adverse events data related to robotic systems and
instruments used in minimally invasive surgery, reported to the U.S. FDA MAUDE
database from January 2000 to December 2013. We determined the number of events
reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most common types of
device malfunctions and their impact on patients, and the causes for
catastrophic events such as major complications, patient injuries, and deaths.
During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient
injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The
numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively
constant since 2007 (mean = 83.4, 95% CI, 74.2-92.7). Surgical specialties, for
which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower
number of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex
surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9, Risk
Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as
falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%),
electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments
(8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a
major part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of
injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of the events, the
procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the
procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it to a later time
(2.5%). Adoption of advanced techniques in design and operation of robotic
surgical systems may reduce these preventable incidents in the future.

equations. We provide analytic expressions for the initial chromo-electric and
chromo-magnetic fields and for their energy-momentum tensor. In particular, we
discuss event-averaged results for energy density and energy flow as well as
for longitudinal and transverse pressure of this system. For example, we find
that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse pressure very early in the system
behaves as $p_L/p_T =
-[1-\frac{3}{2a}(Q\tau)^2]/[1-\frac{1}{a}(Q\tau)^2]+\mathcal{O}(Q\tau)^4$ where
$\tau$ is the longitudinal proper time, $Q$ is related to the saturation scales
$Q_s$ of the two nuclei, and $a = \ln (Q^2/\hat{m}^2)$ with $\hat m$ a scale to
be defined later. Our results are generally applicable if $\tau \lesssim 1/Q$.
As already discussed in a previous paper, the transverse energy flow $S^i$ of
the gluon field exhibits hydrodynamic-like contributions that follow transverse
gradients of the energy density $\nabla^i \varepsilon$. In addition, a
rapidity-odd energy flow also emerges from the non-abelian analog of Gauss' Law
and generates non-vanishing angular momentum of the field. We will discuss the
space-time picture that emerges from our analysis and its implications for
observables in heavy ion collisions.

attractive ranges. We observed all properties to collapse and yield master
curves. Moreover, the vapor-liquid curve is found to share the exact shape of
the Mie and attractive Yukawa. Furthermore, the surface tension and the
logarithm of the vapor pressure are linear functions of this difference of

material from an orbiting secondary star, there is no straightforward means to
decide if the compact object is a black hole or a neutron star. To assist this
classification, we develop a Bayesian statistical model that makes use of the
fact that X-ray binary systems appear to cluster based on their compact object
type when viewed from a 3-dimensional coordinate system derived from X-ray
spectral data. The first coordinate of this data is the ratio of counts in mid
to low energy band (color 1), the second coordinate is the ratio of counts in
high to low energy band (color 2), and the third coordinate is the sum of
counts in all three bands. We use this model to estimate the probabilities that
an X-ray binary system contains a black hole, non-pulsing neutron star, or
pulsing neutron star. In particular, we utilize a latent variable model in
which the latent variables follow a Gaussian process prior distribution, and
hence we are able to induce the spatial correlation we believe exists between
systems of the same type. The utility of this approach is evidenced by the
accurate prediction of system types using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All Sky
Monitor data, but it is not flawless. In particular, non-pulsing neutron
systems containing ""bursters"" that are close to the boundary demarcating
systems containing black holes tend to be classified as black hole systems. As
a byproduct of our analyses, we provide the astronomer with public R code that
can be used to predict the compact object type of X-ray binaries given training
data.

balance function decreases as the collisions become more central and as the
beam energy is increased. In contrast, the widths of the balance functions
calculated using shuffled events show little dependence on centrality or beam
energy and are larger than the observed widths. Balance function widths
calculated using events generated by UrQMD are wider than the measured widths
in central collisions and show little centrality dependence. The measured
widths of the balance functions in central collisions are consistent with the
delayed hadronization of a deconfined quark gluon plasma (QGP). The narrowing
of the balance function in central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV

the quark-gluon plasma prior to hadron production in the early universe binds
up most of the dark matter into heavy (baryon number $B \sim 10^{25}$)
anti-quark nuggets in the current epoch, explaining both the dark matter

massive objects with normal matter in the Earth and Sun will lead to
annihilation and an associated neutrino flux in the $\sim 20-50$ MeV range. We
calculate these fluxes for anti-quark nuggets of sufficient number density to
account for the dark matter and find that current neutrino flux limits from
Super-Kamiokande provide stringent constraints on several possible scenarios
for such objects. Conventional anti-quark nuggets in the previously allowed
mass range cannot account for more than $\sim 1/5$ of the dark matter flux; if
they are in a color-superconducting phase, then their muon production during
matter annihilation must be suppressed by an order of magnitude below prior
estimates if they are to remain viable dark matter candidates.

planet formation throughout the history of the exoplanet field. The giant
planet metallicity correlation has now been widely accepted, but questions
remain as to whether the metallicity correlation extends to the small
terrestrial-sized planets. Here, we report metallicities for a sample of 518
stars in the Kepler field that have no detected transiting planets and compare
their metallicity distribution to a sample of stars that hosts small planets
(Rp < 1.7 R_Earth). Importantly, both samples have been analyzed in a
homogeneous manner using the same set of tools (Stellar Parameters
Classification tool; SPC). We find the average metallicity of the sample of
stars without detected transiting planets to be [m/H]_SNTP,dwarf = -0.02 +-
0.02 dex and the sample of stars hosting small planets to be [m/H]_STP = -0.02
+- 0.02 dex. The average metallicities of the two samples are indistinguishable
within the uncertainties, and the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a
p-value of 0.68 (0.41 sigma), indicating a failure to reject the null
hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population. We
conclude that the homogeneous analysis of the data presented here support the
hypothesis that stars hosting small planets have a metallicity similar to stars
with no known transiting planets in the same area of the sky.

  This paper addresses the problem of deriving correct-by-verified-construction

technical challenges to overcome with the aim of supporting verified
calculational abstract interpretation that is faithful to existing
pencil-and-paper proofs, supports calculation with Galois connections
generally, and enables the extraction of verified static analyzers from these
proofs. To meet these challenges, we develop a theory of Galois connections in
monadic style that include a specification effect. Effectful calculations may
reason classically, while pure calculations have extractable computational
content. Moving between the worlds of specification and implementation is
enabled by our metatheory.
  To validate our approach, we give the first mechanically verified proof of

computing, platform, and software services over the Internet. Task scheduling
algorithms play an important role in the efficiency of cloud computing services
as they aim to reduce the turnaround time of tasks and improve resource
utilization. Several task scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the
literature for cloud computing systems, the majority relying on the
computational complexity of tasks and the distribution of resources. However,
several tasks scheduled following these algorithms still fail because of
unforeseen changes in the cloud environments. In this paper, using tasks
execution and resource utilization data extracted from the execution traces of
real world applications at Google, we explore the possibility of predicting the
scheduling outcome of a task using statistical models. If we can successfully
predict tasks failures, we may be able to reduce the execution time of jobs by
rescheduling failed tasks earlier (i.e., before their actual failing time). Our
results show that statistical models can predict task failures with a precision
up to 97.4%, and a recall up to 96.2%. We simulate the potential benefits of
such predictions using the tool kit GloudSim and found that they can improve
the number of finished tasks by up to 40%. We also perform a case study using
the Hadoop framework of Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and the jobs of a gene
expression correlations analysis study from breast cancer research. We find
that when extending the scheduler of Hadoop with our predictive models, the
percentage of failed jobs can be reduced by up to 45%, with an overhead of less
than 5 minutes.

braiding with the coronal energy conversion by Ohmic dissipation of induced

dissipation within our simulation domain above different fields of view, e.g.
for a small loops system in the AR core. We also choose an ensemble of field
lines to compare, e.g., the magnetic energy input to the heating per particle
along these field lines. Results. We find an enhanced Ohmic dissipation of
currents in the corona above areas that also have enhanced upwards-directed
Poynting flux. These regions coincide with the regions where hot coronal loops
within the AR core are observed. The coronal density plays a role in estimating
the coronal temperature due to the generated heat input. A minimum flux density
of about 200 Gauss is needed in the photosphere to heat a field line to coronal
temperatures of about 1 MK. Conclusions. This suggests that the field-line
braiding mechanism provides the coronal energy input and that the Ohmic
dissipation of induced currents dominates the coronal heating mechanism.

regions of low- and high-mass star-formation remains a central question in
astrochemistry. In particular, with just a few sources studied in detail, it is
unclear what role environment plays in complex molecule formation. In this
light, a comparison of relative abundances of related species between sources
might be useful to explain observed differences. We seek to measure the
relative abundance between three important complex organic molecules, ethylene
glycol ((CH$_2$OH)$_2$), glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and methyl formate
(HCOOCH$_3$), toward high-mass protostars and thereby provide additional
constraints on their formation pathways. We use IRAM 30-m single dish
observations of the three species toward two high-mass star-forming regions -
W51/e2 and G34.3+0.2 - and report a tentative detection of (CH2OH)2 toward both
sources. Assuming that (CH$_2$OH)$_2$, CH$_2$OHCHO and HCOOCH$_3$ spatially
coexist, relative abundance ratios, HCOOCH$_3$/(CH$_2$OH)$_2$, of 31 and 35 are
derived for G34.3+0.2 and W51/e2, respectively. CH$_2$OHCHO is not detected,
but the data provide lower limits to the HCOOCH$_3$/CH$_2$OHCHO abundance
ratios of $\ge$193 for G34.3+0.2 and $\ge$550 for W51/e2. A comparison of these
results to measurements from various sources in the literature indicates that
the source luminosities may be correlated with the HCOOCH$_3$/(CH$_2$OH)$_2$
and HCOOCH$_3$/CH$_2$OHCHO ratios. This apparent correlation may be a
consequence of the relative timescales each source spend at different
temperatures-ranges in their evolution. Furthermore, we obtain lower limits to
the ratio of (CH$_2$OH)$_2$/CH2OHCHO for G34.3+0.2 ($\ge$6) and W51/e2
($\ge$16). This result confirms that a high (CH$_2$OH)$_2$/CH$_2$OHCHO
abundance ratio is not a specific property of comets, as previously speculated.

single emission line that we interpret as the blended [OII]$\lambda3727$
doublet. At this redshift, the peak X/$\gamma$-ray luminosity exceeded
$10^{47}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, while a spatially coincident optical transient source
had $i^{\prime} \sim 22$ (M$_g \sim -21.4$ at $z=0.89$) during early
observations, $\sim 20$ days after the Swift trigger. These properties place
Swift J1112.2-8238 in a very similar region of parameter space to the two
previously identified members of this class, Swift J1644+57 and Swift
J2058+0516. As with those events the high-energy emission shows evidence for
variability over the first few days, while late time observations, almost 3
years post-outburst, demonstrate that it has now switched off. Swift
J1112.2-8238 brings the total number of such events observed by Swift to three,
interestingly all detected by Swift over a $\sim$3 month period ($<3\%$ of its
total lifetime as of March 2015). While this suggests the possibility that
further examples may be uncovered by detailed searches of the BAT archives, the
lack of any prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events are
undoubtedly rare.

in a quantum-critical region near CDW transition, $T_c = A {\bar g}_c$, where
${\bar g}_c$ is charge-fermion coupling and $A$ is the prefactor which we
explicitly compute. We then consider the particular microscopic scenario in
which CDW order parameter emerges as a composite field made out of primary
spin-density-wave fields. We show that charge-fermion coupling ${\bar g}_c$ is
of order of spin-fermion coupling ${\bar g}_s$. As the consequence,
superconducting $T_c$ is substantially enhanced near the onset of CDW order.
Finally we analyze the effect of an external magnetic field $H$. We show that,
as $H$ increases, optimal $T_c$ decreases and the superconducting dome becomes
progressively more confined to the CDW quantum-critical point. These results
are consistent with the experiments.

diversity of star formation histories and variation in star formation rates
(SFRs) in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with similar stellar masses ($M^\ast$).
We examine the dispersion of local SFMS using a complete sample of Sloan
Digital Sky Survey galaxies at 0.01$<z<$0.03 with $\log(M^\ast/M_\odot)>$8.8.
The SFRs are estimated from H$\alpha$ in combination with 22$\mu m$ observation
from WISE. The catalog of bulge+disk decomposition from Simard et al. (2011) is
available for the sample galaxies. We measure the dispersion of specific SFR
(SSFR) as a function of $M^*$. We confirm that the dispersion increases with
$M^*$ from 0.37$\pm0.01$dex at $\log(M^\ast/M_\odot)<$9.6 to 0.51$\pm0.02$dex
at $\log(M^\ast/M_\odot)>$10.2. Despite star formation is mostly associated
with disks, the dispersion of disk SSFR still increases with $M^*$. We conclude
that the presence of bulges/bars is likely responsible for the large dispersion
of SSFR in massive SFGs while low-mass SFGs are mostly disk-dominated and thus
with small dispersion. Our results suggest that star formation on galactic
scales is dramatically affected by central dense structures through both
enhancing and/or quenching processes; while lower-mass SFGs tend to have less
bursty star formation histories. However, the dispersion of SSFR becomes
significantly smaller and remains constant when only disk-dominated SFGs are
counted. This finding implies that the impact of stochastic stellar feedback on
star formation is likely to follow the same pattern in all disk galaxies,
showing no correlation with halo potential.

Rayleigh scattering from short-period exoplanets due to the polarized nature of
scattered light. Since these planets are spatially unresolvable from their host
stars, the relative contribution of the planet-to-total system polarization is
expected to vary with an amplitude of order 10 parts per million (ppm) over the

inherent polarization of the Lick 3-m telescope limits the accuracy of our

conservatively sets a $3 \sigma$ upper limit to the planet-induced polarization
of the system of 58 ppm in $B$ band, which is consistent with a previous upper
limit from the POLISH instrument at the Palomar Observatory 5-m telescope

matter density slope, $\alpha$, on the ratio between stellar-to-halo mass. We
show that this relation holds approximately at all redshifts (with an intrinsic
scatter of ~0.18 in $\alpha$). This implies that in practically all haloes the
shape of their inner density profile changes quite substantially over cosmic
time, as they grow in stellar and total mass. Thus, depending on their final
stellar-to-halo mass ratio, haloes can either form and keep a substantial
density core (size~1 kpc), or form and then destroy the core and re-contract
the halo, going back to a cuspy profile, which is even steeper than CDM
predictions for massive galaxies (~1e12 Msun). We show that results from the
NIHAO suite are in good agreement with recent observational measurements of
$\alpha$ in dwarf galaxies. Overall our results suggest that the notion of a
universal density profile for dark matter haloes is no longer valid in the

surface gravity of 33000$\pm1000$ K and 4.0$\pm0.1$ dex. The abundances of
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium are found to be slightly lower

shape between 2009 and 2014, although H$\alpha$ shows a variable emission. The
H$\alpha$ emission is too strong for a standard O9.7 V and is probably linked
to the magnetic field and the presence of circumstellar material. Its normal
chemical composition and the absence of photospheric line profile variations

$f^{n_{\alpha}}(\alpha) = \alpha$. The sets $\{\alpha, f(\alpha), \ldots,
f^{n_{\alpha} - 1}(\alpha), \alpha\}$ generated by the iterates of $f$ are
called cycles. For $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ it is known that cycles of length 1 and 2
occur, and no others. While much is known for extensions to number fields, we
concentrate on extending $\mathbb{Z}$ by adjoining reciprocals of primes. Let
$\mathbb{Z}[1/p_1, \ldots, 1/p_n]$ denote $\mathbb{Z}$ extended by adding in
the reciprocals of the $n$ primes $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ and all their products and
powers with each other and the elements of $\mathbb{Z}$.
  Interestingly, cycles of length 4, called 4-cycles, emerge for polynomials in
$\mathbb{Z}\left[1/p_1, \ldots, 1/p_n\right][x]$ under the appropriate
conditions. The problem of finding criteria under which 4-cycles emerge is
equivalent to determining how often a sum of four terms is zero, where the
terms are $\pm 1$ times a product of elements from the list of $n$ primes. We

disks. Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot
explain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high
contrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three
dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks
excited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the
pitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be
explained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a
tertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive
planet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have
larger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in
the azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in
the outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have
significant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk
atmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer
calculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more
prominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D hydrodynamical models than
images based on 2-D models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,
indicating the need to model observations with full 3-D hydrodynamics. Overall,
companion-induced spiral arms not only pinpoint the companion's position but
also provide three independent ways (pitch angle, separation between two arms,
and contrast of arms) to constrain the companion's mass.

cohomogeneity-1 property of these spacetimes, the equations of motion simplify
considerably. This allows us to easily separate the radial motion from the
angular part and to obtain solutions for angular trajectories in a compact
closed form. For the radial motion we focus our attention on spherical orbits.
In particular, we determine the timelike innermost stable circular orbits

null circular orbits. We find that the ISCO dives below the ergosurface for
black holes rotating close to extremality and merges with the event horizon
exactly at extremality, in analogy with the four-dimensional Kerr case. For
sufficiently massive black holes in AdS there exists a spin parameter range in
which the background spacetime is stable against superradiance and the ISCO
lies inside the ergoregion. Our results for massless geodesics show that there
are no stable circular null orbits outside the horizon, but there exist such
orbits inside the horizon, as well as around over-extremal spacetimes, i.e.,
naked singularities. We also discuss how these orbits deform from the static to

we further separate our sample into the canonical Galactic components. We then
studied the abundances ratios, of Mg, Ti, Si, Ca, O, S, Al, C+N, Na, Ni, Mn, V,

halo subgroup is chemically distinct in the $\alpha$-elements (particularly O,
Mg, and S), Al, C+N, and Ni from the $\alpha$-rich halo, consistent with the
literature confirming the existence of an $\alpha$-poor accreted halo
population; (2) the canonical thick disk and halo are not chemically distinct
in all elements indicating a smooth transition between the thick disk and halo;
(3) a subsample of the $\alpha$-poor stars at metallicities as low as [Fe/H]
$\sim$ -0.85 dex are chemically and dynamically consistent with the thin disk
indicating that the thin disk may extend to lower metallicities than previously
thought, and (4) that the location of the most metal-poor thin disk stars are
consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient. Finally, we used our

  distribution modeling of galaxy statistics","comments welcome!",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, I explore an empirically motivated model for investigating the
relationship between galaxy stellar masses, star formation rates and their halo
masses and mass accretion histories. The core statistical quantity in this
model is the stellar mass assembly distribution, $P(dM_{*}/dt|\mathbf{X},a)$,
which specifies the probability density distribution of stellar mass assembly
rates given a set of halo properties $\mathbf{X}$ and epoch $a$. Predictions
from this model are obtained by integrating the stellar mass assembly
distribution (SMAD) over halo merger trees, easily obtained from modern,
high-resolution $N$-body simulations. Further properties of the galaxies hosted
by the halos can be obtained by post-processing the stellar mass assembly
histories with stellar population synthesis models. In my particular example
implementation of this model, I use the \citet{behroozi13a} constraint on the
median stellar mass assembly rates of halos as a function of their mass and
redshift to construct an example parameterization of
$P(dM_{*}/dt|\mathbf{X},a)$. This SMAD is then integrated over individual halo
mass accretion histories from $N$-body merger trees starting at z = 4, using
simple rules to account for merging halos. I find that this a simple model can
reproduce qualitatively the bimodal features of the low-redshift galaxy
population, including the qualitative split in the two-point clustering as a
function of specific star formation rate. These results indicate that models
which directly couple halo and galaxy growth through simple efficiency
functions can naturally predict the star formation rate bimodality in
higher-order statistics of the galaxy field, such as its two-point correlations

preferentially around 45 degrees from the equatorial plane. Neutrino heating is
strengthened by MC transport a few scale heights above the disk midplane near
the innermost stable circular orbit, potentially leading to a stronger
neutrino-driven wind. Neutrino cooling in the dense midplane of the disk is
stronger when using MC transport, leading to a globally higher cooling rate by
a factor of a few and a larger leptonization rate by an order of magnitude. We

an apparent TN beyond that of bulk CoO, and an enhanced anisotropy compared to

between rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and
short cycles simultaneously. Within this sample, the solar cycle periods are
typical of a more rapidly rotating star, implying that the Sun might be in a

cycles and find durations ranging from 9.6-15.5 years. We find the short-term
variability to be intermittent, but present throughout the majority of the time

the lighter $h^0$ from the LEP Higgs search prohibits the extreme decoupling

charged Higgs $H^\pm$ below about 600 GeV. In addition, the $Z_2$ symmetry is
shown to be a good approximate symmetry since the soft $Z_2$ symmetry breaking

interestingly, a few parameters in the Higgs potential and the related Higgs

the red-shift factor which, as we show explicitly in the spherically symmetric

without assuming the positivity of the spatial Ricci tensor. We then generalize
our considerations to arbitrary, static and not necessarily spherically
symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the case of spacetimes with a
horizon our generalization involves the so-called {\it domain of dependence}.
The respective volume, expressed in terms of the duration measured by a distant
observer compared with the volume of the domain in Minkowski spacetime,
exhibits behaviours which differ if $d=4$ or $d>4$. This peculiarity of four
dimensions is due to the logarithmic subleading term in the asymptotic
expansion of the metric near infinity. In terms of the invariant duration
measured by a co-moving observer associated with the diamond we establish an
inequality which is universal for all $d$. We suggest some possible

molecules is through the use of reactive boundary conditions. One common model
is the Smoluchowski partial absorption condition, which uses a Robin boundary
condition in the separation coordinate between two possible reactants. This
boundary condition can be interpreted as an idealization of a reactive
interaction potential model, in which a potential barrier must be surmounted
before reactions can occur. In this work we show how the reactive boundary
condition arises as the limit of an interaction potential encoding a steep
barrier within a shrinking region in the particle separation, where molecules
react instantly upon reaching the peak of the barrier. The limiting boundary
condition is derived by the method of matched asymptotic expansions, and shown
to depend critically on the relative rate of increase of the barrier height as
the width of the potential is decreased. Limiting boundary conditions for the
same interaction potential in both the overdamped Fokker-Planck equation
(Brownian Dynamics), and the Kramers equation (Langevin Dynamics) are
investigated. It is shown that different scalings are required in the two
models to recover reactive boundary conditions that are consistent in the high
friction limit where the Kramers equation solution converges to the solution of
the Fokker-Planck equation.

fitted Q-iteration is used to construct a policy from a batch of experimental

control approach has been evaluated quantitatively using a simulation and
qualitatively in a living lab. From the quantitative analysis it has been found
that the control approach converges in approximately 20 days to obtain a

the spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar. Here we describe a possible
signature of the central engine: a burst of shock breakout emission occurring
several days after the supernova explosion. The energy input from the magnetar
inflates a high-pressure bubble that drives a shock through the pre-exploded
supernova ejecta. If the magnetar is powerful enough, that shock will near the
ejecta surface and become radiative. At the time of shock breakout, the ejecta
will have expanded to a large radius (~10^{14} cm) so that the radiation
released is at optical/ultraviolet wavelengths (T ~ 20,000 K) and lasts for
several days. The luminosity and timescale of this magnetar driven shock
breakout are similar to the first peak observed recently in the double-peaked
light curve of SNLSQ14BDQ. However, for a large region of model parameter
space, the breakout emission is predicted to be dimmer than the diffusive
luminosity from direct magnetar heating. A distinct double peaked light curve
may therefore only be conspicuous if thermal heating from the magnetar is
suppressed at early times. We describe how such a delay in heating may
naturally result from inefficient dissipation and thermalization of the pulsar
wind magnetic energy. Without such suppression, the breakout may only be
noticeable as a small bump or kink in the early luminosity or color evolution,
or as a small but abrupt rise in the photospheric velocity. A similar breakout
signature may accompany other central engines in supernovae, such as a black
hole accreting fallback material.

branch length, one obtains a one-dimensional likelihood function. In this work,
we introduce a mathematical framework to characterize the shapes of such
one-dimensional phylogenetic likelihood functions. This framework is based on
analyses of algebraic structures on the space of all frequency patterns with
respect to a polynomial representation of the likelihood functions. Using this
framework, we provide conditions under which the one-dimensional phylogenetic
likelihood functions are guaranteed to have at most one stationary point, and
this point is the maximum likelihood branch length. These conditions are
satisfied by common simple models including all binary models, the Jukes-Cantor
model and the Felsenstein 1981 model.
  We then prove that for the simplest model that does not satisfy our
conditions, namely, the Kimura 2-parameter model, the one-dimensional
likelihood functions may have multiple stationary points. As a proof of
concept, we construct a non-degenerate example in which the phylogenetic
likelihood function has two local maxima and a local minimum. To construct such
examples, we derive a general method of constructing a tree and sequence data
with a specified frequency pattern at the root. We then extend the result to
prove that the space of all rescaled and translated one-dimensional
phylogenetic likelihood functions under the Kimura 2-parameter model is dense
in the space of all non-negative continuous functions on $[0, \infty)$ with
finite limits. These results indicate that one-dimensional likelihood functions
under advanced evolutionary models can be more complex than it is typically

(magneto)hydrodynamic equations under the Boussinesq approximation. The Ekman
number ranges from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$. The supercriticality of the
convection reaches about 1000 in some models. Four sets of simulations are
considered: non-magnetic simulations and dynamo simulations with either
free-slip or no-slip flow boundary conditions. The non-magnetic setup with
free-slip boundaries generates the strongest zonal flows. Both non-magnetic
simulations with no-slip flow boundary conditions and self-consistent dynamos
with free-slip boundaries have drastically reduced zonal-flows. Suppression of
shear leads to a substantial gain in heat-transfer efficiency, increasing by a
factor of 3 in some cases. Such efficiency enhancement occurs as long as the
convection is significantly influenced by rotation. At higher convective
driving the heat-transfer efficiency tends towards that of the classical
non-rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard system. Analysis of the latitudinal distribution
of heat flow at the outer boundary reveals that the shear is most effective at
suppressing heat-transfer in the equatorial regions. Furthermore, we explore
the influence of the magnetic field on the {\em non-zonal} flow components of
the convection. For this we compare the heat-transfer efficiency of no-slip
non-magnetic cases with that of the no-slip dynamo simulations. We find that at
$E=10^{-5}$ magnetic field significantly affects the convection and a maximum
gain of about 30\% (as compared to the non-magnetic case) in heat-transfer
efficiency is obtained for an Elsasser number of about 3. Our analysis
motivates us to speculate that convection in the polar regions in dynamos at

experiments when the number of covariates is large. Investigators often use
linear multivariate regression to analyze randomized experiments instead of
simply reporting the difference of means between treatment and control groups.
Their aim is to reduce the variance of the estimated treatment effect by
adjusting for covariates. If there are a large number of covariates relative to
the number of observations, regression may perform poorly because of
overfitting. In such cases, the Lasso may be helpful. We study the resulting
Lasso-based treatment effect estimator under the Neyman-Rubin model of
randomized experiments. We present theoretical conditions that guarantee that
the estimator is more efficient than the simple difference-of-means estimator,
and we provide a conservative estimator of the asymptotic variance, which can
yield tighter confidence intervals than the difference-of-means estimator.
Simulation and data examples show that Lasso-based adjustment can be
advantageous even when the number of covariates is less than the number of
observations. Specifically, a variant using Lasso for selection and OLS for
estimation performs particularly well, and it chooses a smoothing parameter
based on combined performance of Lasso and OLS.

expected to be accurate only for small changes in the quantum state. But when
Newton's constant is small relative to the AdS scale, the former holds to good

suggests that -- for appropriate states -- corrections to the first law of

These stars were identified as EMP candidates based on their medium-resolution
(R~2,000) spectra, and were followed-up with high-resolution (R~35,000)
spectroscopy with the Magellan-Clay Telescope. Their derived chemical
abundances exhibit good agreement with those of stars with similar
metallicities. We also provide new insights on the formation of the UMP stars,
based on comparison with a new set of theoretical models of supernovae
nucleosynthesis. The models were matched with 20 UMP stars found in the
literature, together with one of the program stars (SDSS J1204+1201), with
[Fe/H]=-4.34. From fitting their abundances, we find that the supernovae
progenitors, for stars where carbon and nitrogen are measured, had masses
ranging from 20.5 M_sun to 28 M_sun and explosion energies from 0.3 to
0.9x10^51 erg. These results are highly sensitive to the carbon and nitrogen
abundance determinations, which is one of the main drivers for future
high-resolution follow-up of UMP candidates. In addition, we are able to
reproduce the different CNO abundance patterns found in UMP stars with a single
progenitor type, by varying its mass and explosion energy.

representing knowledge as logical sentences. This is a skill that seems to
require extensive practice to obtain, suggesting a teaching strategy that
involves the assignment of numerous exercises involving the formulation of some
bit of knowledge, communicated using a natural language such as English, as a
sentence in some logic. The number of such exercises needed to master this
skill is far too large to allow typical artificial intelligence course teaching
teams to provide prompt feedback on student efforts. Thus, an automated
assessment system for such exercises is needed to ensure that students receive
an adequate amount of practice, with the rapid delivery of feedback allowing
students to identify errors in their understanding and correct them. This paper
describes an automated grading system for knowledge representation exercises
using first-order logic. A resolution theorem prover, \textit{Prover9}, is used
to check if a student-submitted formula is logically equivalent to a solution
provided by the instructor. This system has been used by students enrolled in
undergraduate artificial intelligence classes for several years. Use of this
teaching tool resulted in a statistically significant improvement on
first-order logic knowledge representation questions appearing on the course
final examination. This article explains how this system works, provides an
analysis of changes in student learning outcomes, and explores potential
enhancements of this system, including the possibility of providing rich
formative feedback by replacing the resolution theorem prover with a
tableaux-based method.

should be proven or, instead, refuted. Yet, as we now know, in either case the
final argument produced had better be not just convincing but actually
verifiable in as much detail as our need for eliminating risk might require.
For those who do not happen to have direct access to the realm of mathematical
truths, the modern field of formalized mathematics has quite a few lessons to
contribute, and one might pay heed to what it has to say, for instance, about:
the importance of employing proof strategies; the fine control of automation in
unraveling the structure of a certain proof object; reasoning forward from the
givens and backward from the goals, in developing proof scripts; knowing when
and how definitions and identities apply in a helpful way, and when they do not
apply; seeing proofs [and refutations] as dynamical objects, not reflected by
the static derivation trees that Proof Theory wants them to be. I believe that
the great challenge for teachers and learners resides currently less on the
availability of suitable generic tools than in combining them wisely in view of
their preferred education paradigms and introducing them in a way that best
fits their specific aims, possibly with the help of intelligent online
interactive tutoring systems. As a proof of concept, a computerized proof
assistant that makes use of several successful tools already freely available
on the market and that takes into account some of the above findings about
teaching and learning Logic is hereby introduced. To fully account for our
informed intuitions on the subject it would seem that a little bit extra
technology would still be inviting, but no major breakthrough is really needed:

the pseudogap scales linearly with energy, which prevents the formation of
BICs. In this Letter, we explore the effects of non-local coupling
characterized by the Fano factor of interference $q_{0},$ tunable by changing
the slope of the Dirac cones in the graphene band-structure. We demonstrate
that three distinct regimes can be identified: i) for $q_{0}<q_{c1}$ (critical
point) a mixed pseudogap $\Delta\propto|\varepsilon|,|\varepsilon|^{2}$ appears
yielding a phase with spin-degenerate BICs; ii) near $q_{0}=q_{c1}$ when
$\Delta\propto|\varepsilon|^{2}$ the system undergoes a quantum phase
transition in which the new phase is characterized by magnetic BICs and iii) at
a second critical value $q_{0}>q_{c2}$ the cubic scaling of the pseudogap with
energy $\Delta\propto|\varepsilon|^{3}$ characteristic to the phantom atom
configuration is restored and the phase with non-magnetic BICs is recovered.
The phase with magnetic BICs can be described in terms of an effective
intrinsic exchange field of ferromagnetic nature between the adatoms mediated
by graphene monolayer. We thus propose a new type of quantum phase transition
resulting from the competition between the states characterized by
spin-degenerate and magnetic BICs.

energy consumption while improving users' quality of service (QoS) in green
relay-assisted cellular networks, where the base station (BS) is powered by
grid power and the RSs are powered by renewable energy. By adopting green RSs,
the grid power consumption of the BS is greatly reduced. But due to the
uncertainty and stochastic characteristics of the renewable energy, power
supply for RSs is not always sufficient. Thus the harvested energy needs to be
scheduled appropriately to cater to the dynamic traffic so as to minimize the
energy saving in the long term. An optimization problem is formulated to find
the optimal sleep ratio of RSs to match the time variation of energy harvesting
and traffic arrival. To fully use the renewable energy, green-RS-first
principle is adopted in the user association process. The optimal RS sleeping
policy is obtained through dynamic programming (DP) approach, which divides the
original optimization problem into per-stage subproblems. A reduced DP
algorithm and a greedy algorithm are further proposed to greatly reduce the
computation complexity. By simulations, the reduced DP algorithm outperforms
the greedy algorithm in achieving satisfactory energy saving and QoS
performance.

experiments, but also precise and reliable theoretical predictions. Triple
vector boson production provides a unique opportunity to investigate the
quartic gauge couplings and check the validity of the gauge principle in the
SM. Since the tree-level predictions alone are inadequate to meet this demand,
the next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation becomes compulsory. In this paper,
we calculate the NLO QCD + NLO electroweak (EW) corrections to the $W^{\pm}ZZ$
productions with subsequent leptonic decays at the $14~{\rm TeV}$ LHC by
adopting an improved narrow width approximation which takes into account the
off-shell contributions and spin correlations from the $W^{\pm}$- and $Z$-boson
leptonic decays. The NLO QCD+EW corrected integrated cross sections for the
$W^{\pm}ZZ$ productions and some kinematic distributions of final products are
provided. The results show that both the NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections are
significant. In the jet-veto event selection scheme with $p_{T,jet}^{cut} = 50~
{\rm GeV}$, the NLO QCD+EW relative corrections to the integrated cross section
are $20.5\%$ and $31.1\%$, while the genuine NLO EW relative corrections are
$-5.42\%$ and $-4.58\%$, for the $W^+ZZ$ and $W^-ZZ$ productions, respectively.
We also investigate the theoretical dependence of the integrated cross section
on the factorization/renormalization scale, and find that the scale uncertainty
is underestimated at the LO due to the fact that the strong coupling $\alpha_s$
is not involved in the LO matrix elements.

Wide Web, has succeeded to enable information exchange worldwide. Since its
first version in 1996, HTTP/1.0, the average number of inlined objects and
average total bytes per webpage have been increasing significantly for desktops
and mobiles, from 1-10 objects in 1996 to more than 100 objects in June 2014.
Even if the retrieving of inlined objects can be parallelized as a given
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document is streamed, a maximum number of
connections is allocated, and thus as the number of inlined objects increases,
the overall webpage load duration grows, and the HTTP servers loading also gets
higher. To overcome this issue, we propose a new HTTP method called BURST,
which allows to retrieve the missing inlined objects of a webpage efficiently
by requesting sets of web objects. We experimentally demonstrate the potential
via a proof-of-concept demonstration, by comparing the regular HTTP to proposed
HTTP-Burst using a virtual private server and real HTTP client and server over
the Internet. The results indicate a latency reduction of webpage load duration
compared to HTTP as high as 52 % under the considered configurations.

the rate of breaking of latent complex, which initiates the signaling feedback
loop after the active TGFb release and leads to a change of cell phenotype
driven by the smooth muscle actin. We investigate the dynamic and steady-state

analyse the timescale of approach to the steady state, the stability of the
non-linear dynamical system, and how the steady-state concentrations of the key
markers vary depending on the elasticity of the substrate. We discover a
crossover region for values of substrate elasticity closely corresponding to
that of the fibroblast to myofibroblast transition. We suggest that the cell
could actively vary the parameters of its dynamic feedback loop to `choose' the

doped La1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors. More than threefold increase in Tc
(10.3 K) is observed with external pressure (at ~1.74 GPa at a rate of 4.08
K/GPa)) for x = 0.2 composition. There is a concomitant large improvement in
the quality of the superconducting transition. Beyond this pressure Tc
decreases monotonously at the rate of -2.09 K/GPa. In the x = 0.8 sample, we do
not observe any enhancement in Tc with application of pressure (up to 1.76
GPa). The semiconducting behavior observed in the normal state resistivity of
both of the samples is significantly subdued with the application of pressure
which, if interpreted invoking thermal activation process, implies that the
activation energy gap of the carriers is significantly reduced with pressure.
We believe these observations should generate further interest in the
La1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors.

of cognitive psychometrics. Particularly, diffusion modeling of response times
(RTs) from correct and erroneous responses using the Wiener distribution has
become a popular measurement tool because it provides a set of psychologically
interpretable parameters. However, an important precondition to identify all of
these parameters is a sufficient number of RTs from erroneous responses. In the
present article, we show by simulation that the parameters of the Wiener
distribution can be recovered from tasks yielding very high or even perfect
response accuracies using the shifted Wald distribution. Specifically, we argue
that error RTs can be modeled as correct RTs that have undergone censoring by
using techniques from parametric survival analysis. We illustrate our reasoning
by fitting the Wiener and (censored) shifted Wald distribution to RTs from six
participants who completed a Go/No-go task. In accordance with our simulations,
diffusion modeling using the Wiener and the shifted Wald distribution yielded
identical parameter estimates when the number of erroneous responses was
predicted to be low. Moreover, the modeling of error RTs as censored correct
RTs substantially improved the recovery of these diffusion parameters when
premature trial timeout was introduced to increase the number of omission
errors. Thus, the censored shifted Wald distribution provides a suitable means
for diffusion modeling in situations when the Wiener distribution cannot be
fitted without parametric constraints.

has limited applicability at low frequencies because the observed pulses can
easily be spread out by interstellar effects like scattering or dispersion,
leading to a non-pulsed continuum component that is necessarily ignored in this
type of analysis. In particular for the class of the millisecond pulsars (MSPs)
at frequencies below 200MHz, such interstellar effects can seriously compromise
de- tectability and measured flux densities. In this paper we investigate MSP
spectra based on a complementary approach, namely through investigation of
archival con- tinuum imaging data. Even though these images lose sensitivity to
pulsars since the on-pulse emission is averaged with off-pulse noise, they are
insensitive to effects from scattering and provide a reliable way to determine
the flux density and spectral indices of MSPs based on both pulsed and unpulsed
components. Using the 74MHz VLSSr as well as the 325MHz WENSS and 1.4GHz NVSS
catalogues, we investigate the imaging flux densities of MSPs and evaluate the

schemes are more error resilient than their qubit-based counterparts. Their
high error resiliency comes partly from the careful encoding of multiple bits
of signals used to generate the raw key in each transmitted qudit so that the
same eavesdropping attempt causes a higher bit error rate (BER) in the raw key.
Here I show that highly error-tolerant PM-QKD schemes can be constructed simply
by encoding one bit of classical information in each transmitted qudit in the
form $(|i\rangle\pm|j\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, where $|i\rangle$'s form an
orthonormal basis of the $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space. Moreover, I prove
that these schemes can tolerate up to the theoretical maximum of 50\% BER for
$n\ge 2$ provided that the raw key is generated under a certain technical
condition, making them the most error-tolerant PM-QKD schemes involving the
transmission of unentangled finite-dimensional qudits to date. This shows the
potential of processing quantum information using lower-dimensional quantum
signals encoded in a higher-dimensional quantum state.

what previously suggested, this reaction is essentially barrierless and can,
therefore, occur under the low temperature conditions of interstellar objects

with near-infrared data from the NEWFIRM instrument, and 870 um dust continuum
emission data from the LABOCA instrument, to estimate column densities. We use
the data to identify fragments from the cloud and to determine the radial
density distribution of its filamentary part. We compare the cloud's morphology
with 13CO and C18O line emission observed with the APEX/SHeFI instrument. The
Musca cloud is pronouncedly fragmented at its ends, but harbours a remarkably
well-defined, 1.6 pc long filament in its Center region. The line mass of the
filament is 21-31 Ms pc^-1 and FWHM 0.07 pc. Its radial profile can be fitted
with a Plummer profile that has the power-index of 2.6 \pm 11%, flatter than
that of an infinite hydrostatic filament. The profile can also be fitted with a
hydrostatic cylinder truncated by external pressure. These models imply a
central density of 5-10 x 10^4 cm^-3. The fragments in the cloud have a mean
separation of 0.4 pc, in agreement with gravitational fragmentation. These
properties, together with the subsonic and velocity-coherent nature of the
cloud, suggest a scenario in which an initially hydrostatic cloud is currently
gravitationally fragmenting. The fragmentation has started a few tenths of a
Myr ago from the cloud ends, leaving its center yet relatively non-fragmented,
possibly because of gravitational focusing in a finite geometry.

investigated experimentally and by ab initio theory in non-equilibrium states
of the free-electron metal aluminium. The temporal evolution of the atomic mean
squared displacement in laser-excited thin free-standing films was monitored by
femtosecond electron diffraction. The electron-phonon coupling strength was
obtained for a range of electronic and lattice temperatures from density
functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations. The electron-phonon
coupling parameter extracted from the experimental data in the framework of a
two-temperature model (TTM) deviates significantly from the ab initio values.
We introduce a non-thermal lattice model (NLM) for describing non-thermal
phonon distributions as a sum of thermal distributions of the three phonon
branches. The contributions of individual phonon branches to the
electron-phonon coupling are considered independently and found to be dominated
by longitudinal acoustic phonons. Using all material parameters from
first-principle calculations besides the phonon-phonon coupling strength, the
prediction of the energy transfer from electrons to phonons by the NLM is in
excellent agreement with time-resolved diffraction data. Our results suggest
that the TTM is insufficient for describing the microscopic energy flow even
for simple metals like aluminium and that the determination of the
electron-phonon coupling constant from time-resolved experiments by means of
the TTM leads to incorrect values. In contrast, the NLM describing transient
phonon populations by three parameters appears to be a sufficient model for
quantitatively describing electron-lattice equilibration in aluminium. We
discuss the general applicability of the NLM and provide a criterion for the
suitability of the two-temperature approximation for other metals.

cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), which is the expectation that spacetime
singularities will be hidden from faraway observers by event horizons so that
classical predictability in a spacetime is preserved. These experiments involve
the interaction of an extremal or a slightly sub-extremal black hole with a
test particle or field, attempting to destroy the horizon, i.e. to create a
so-called naked singularity. They usually conclude that WCCC cannot be violated
starting from an extremal black hole, but may be violated starting from a
slightly sub-extremal one, if backreaction and self-force effects are
neglected. Some other works also analyze these effects.
  Starting 2007, a string of papers argue if WCCC can be violated by
classically forbidden interactions occuring via the quantum nature of the
particles associated with the fields; and where backrection and/or
superradiance are pointed out as effects working in the direction of preserving
the WCCC. We correct/modify a backrection argument, and furthermore point out
that superradiance does not prevent {\em single particles} from being captured
by the black hole; even if this capture would lead to WCCC violation.
  Then we consider the spontaneous emission (which we call the Zel'dovich-Unruh
effect) of particles by the black hole, and find that at least for scalars, it
can be understood without second quantization. It also completely invalidates
the mentioned single- or few-particle thought experiments. However, the
conclusions of our previous work on (at least) scalar fields interacting with
black holes, i.e. that WCCC may be violated starting from slightly subextremal
black holes, remains valid in this (semi)classical framework.

paper, based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM), a new approach, namely the
method of directly defining inverse mapping (MDDiM), is proposed to gain
analytic approximations of nonlinear differential equations. In other words,
one can solve a nonlinear differential equation ${\mathscr A}\varphi = f$ by
means of directly defining an inverse mapping $\mathscr J$, i.e. without
calculating any inverse operators. Here, the inverse mapping $\mathscr J$ is
even unnecessary to be explicitly expressed in a differential form, since
""mapping"" is a more general concept than ""differential operator"". To guide how
to directly define an inverse mapping $\mathscr J$, some rules are provided.
Besides, a convergence theorem is proved, which guarantees that a convergent
series solution given by the MDDiM must be a solution of problems under
consideration. In addition, three nonlinear differential equations are used to
illustrate the validity and potential of the MDDiM, and especially the great
freedom and large flexibility of directly defining inverse mappings for various
types of nonlinear problems. The method of directly defining inverse mapping
(MDDiM) might open a completely new, more general way to solve nonlinear

frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems. We consider a base
station with large number antennas serving many single antenna users. We first
show that any unused capacity in the uplink can be traded off for higher
throughput in the downlink in a system that uses either dirty paper (DP) coding
or linear zero-forcing (ZF) precoding. We then also study the scaling of the
system throughput with the number of antennas in cases of linear Beamforming
(BF) Precoding, ZF Precoding, and DP coding. We show that the downlink
throughput is proportional to the logarithm of the number of antennas. While,
this logarithmic scaling is lower than the linear scaling of the rate in the
uplink, it can still bring significant throughput gains. For example, we
demonstrate through analysis and simulation that increasing the number of
antennas from 4 to 128 will increase the throughput by more than a factor of 5.
We also show that a logarithmic scaling of downlink throughput as a function of

s-wave superconductor/ferromagnetic metal/normal metal/ferromagnetic
metal/s-wave superconductor (S/F1/N/F2/S) Josephson junction. Using
quasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes
finite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency
spin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,
which are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that
the magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,
M(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between
two Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,
while MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase
coherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows
us to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that
MI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization
MII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged
magnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC
voltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)
with frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. This is
because MII(d,q) oscillates generally in time t (AC magnetization) with
dq/dt=2e[V+v_ac(t)]/h and thus <MII(d,q)>=0, but can be converted into the
time-independent DC magnetization for DC voltage at Vn. We also discuss that
the magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.
Therefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an
alternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson
junctions. Our results also provide a basic concept for tunable magnetization
in superconducting spintronics devices.

interested in conductor developments. In fact, after some years of development,
critical current densities Jc of about 105 A/cm2 at fields up to more than 10 T
have been obtained in powder in tube (PIT) processed wires and tapes. Here we
explore the crucial points in the wire/tape fabrication by means of the ex-situ
PIT method. We focus on scaling up processes which are crucial for the
industrial fabrication. We analyzed the effects on the microstructure of the
different heat and mechanical treatments. By an extensive microstructural
analysis correlated with the transport properties we addressed the issues
concerning the phase purity, the internal porosity and crack formation in the
superconducting core region. Our best conductors with a filling factor of about
30 heat treated at 800 C exhibited Tc = 38 K the highest value measured in such
kind of superconducting tape. The microstructure analysis shows clean and well
connected grain boundaries but rather poor density: The measured Jc of about 3
x 10^4 A/cm2 in self-field is suppressed by less than a factor 7 at 7 T. Such
not yet optimized Jc values can be accounted for by the reduced density while
the moderate in-field suppression and a rather high n-factor confirm the high
homogeneity and uniformity of these tapes.

Automated fits using two independent Gaussian profiles and a third component
that accounts for the nebular emission allow us to discern distinct
morphological types of H$\alpha$ line profiles with the introduction of a
simplified classification scheme. All in all we find 3765 stars with intrinsic
emission and sort their spectra into eight distinct morphological categories:
single--component emission, emission blend, sharp emission peaks, double
emission, P-Cygni, inverted P-Cygni, self--absorption, and emission in
absorption. We have more than one observation for 1430 stars in our sample,
thus allowing a quantitative discussion of the degree of variability of
H$\alpha$ emission profiles, which is expected for young, active objects. We
present a catalogue of stars with properties of their H$\alpha$ emission line
profiles, morphological classification, analysis of variability with time and
the supplementary information from the SIMBAD, VizieR, and ADS databases. The
records in SIMBAD indicate the presence of H$\alpha$ emission for roughly 25%
of all stars in our catalogue, while at least 305 of them have already been
more thoroughly investigated according to the references in ADS. The most
frequently identified morphological categories in our sample of spectra are
emission blend (23%), emission in absorption (22%), and self--absorption (16%).
Objects with repeated observations demonstrate that our classification into
discrete categories is generally stable through time, but categories P-Cygni
and self--absorption seem less stable, which is the consequence of discrete
classification rules, as well as of the fundamental change in profile shape.

extended to hardcore bosons of several kinds (flavors). The approach based on

thermodynamic limit with fixed, super-critical particle density. We show that
the process exhibits metastability with respect to the condensate location,
i.e. the suitably accelerated process of the rescaled location converges to a
limiting Markov process on the unit torus. This process has stationary,

previous work for fixed lattices and diverging density in [J. Beltran, C.

the martingale approach developed there and in subsequent publications. Besides
additional technical difficulties in estimating error bounds for transition
rates, the thermodynamic limit requires new estimates for equilibration towards
a suitably defined distribution in metastable wells, corresponding to a typical
set of configurations with a particular condensate location. The total exit
rates from individual wells turn out to diverge in the limit, which requires an
intermediate regularization step using the symmetries of the process and the

the evolution of galaxies through time. The need for recovering the light
reprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolution
far-infrared data. Recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative,
although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging or
long-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability.
Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is clearly the way to overcome such
limitation. We obtain integrated H{\alpha}, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared
(IR)-based SFR measurements for 272 galaxies from the CALIFA survey at 0.005 <
z < 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. We provide updated calibrations,
both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphological
type), referred to H{\alpha}. The extinction-corrected H{\alpha} luminosity
agrees with the updated hybrid SFR estimators based on either UV or H{\alpha}
plus IR luminosity over the full range of SFRs (0.03-20 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).
The coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born stars
that is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a$_{IR}$, shows a large
dispersion. However, it does not became increasingly small at high
attenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured H$\alpha$ emission
would be missed. Lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 AGN host galaxies
show smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and AGN to
dust heating. In the Local Universe the H{\alpha} luminosity derived from IFS
observations can be used to measure SFR, at least in statistically-significant,
optically-selected galaxy samples. The analysis of the SFR calibrations by
galaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study the
impact of different selection criteria in the SFR values derived.

noise and the interference are statistically independent Gaussian random
sequences. More recent works extended this approach to the case where the noise

Gaussian and statistical independence assumptions. We provide lower bounds on
the achievable data rates in a DPC setting for the case of possibly dependent

are allowed to have arbitrary probability distributions. The bounds are
relatively simple, are phrased in terms of second-order statistics, and are

crucial for the design, com- missioning and operation of precision

detectors. Numerical simulations are indispensable tools for this task but
their utility can in practice be limited by the computational cost of
describing the scattering process. In this paper we present an efficient method
to significantly reduce the computational cost of optical simulations that
incorporate scattering. This is accomplished by constructing a near optimal
representation of the complex, multi-parameter 2D overlap integrals that
describe the scattering process (referred to as a reduced order quadrature). We
demonstrate our technique by simulating a near-unstable Fabry-Perot cavity and
its control signals using similar optics to those installed in one of the LIGO
gravitational-wave detectors. We show that using reduced order quadrature
reduces the computational time of the numerical simulation from days to minutes
(a speed-up of $\approx 2750 \times$) whilst incurring negligible errors. This
significantly increases the feasibility of modelling interferometers with
realistic imperfections to overcome current limits in state-of-the-art optical
systems. Whilst we focus on the Hermite-Gaussian basis for describing the
scattering of the optical fields, our method is generic and could be applied
with any suitable basis. An implementation of this reduced order quadrature
method is provided in the open source interferometer simulation software

of context permeability, using a game in which agents try to achieve global
consensus. We design and analyse two different models of permeability. In the
first model, agents interact concurrently in multiple social networks. In the
second, we introduce a context switching mechanism which adds a dynamic
temporal component to agent interaction in the model. Agents switch between the
different networks spending more or less time in each one. We compare these
models and analyse the influence of different social networks regarding the
speed of convergence to consensus. We conduct a series of experiments that show
the impact of different configurations for coexisting social networks. This
approach unveils both the limitations of the current modelling approaches and
possible research directions for complex social space simulations.

1% when pure CO$_2$ gas with partial pressure of 1 atmosphere is passed through
a horizontal retort furnace maintained at 1100$^o$ C for 24 hours. Our results
clearly demonstrated that decarburisation can be very effective, when CO$_2$ is
used at temperatures where it is unstable and the Boudouard reaction which is
endothermic in nature is more favoured. Based on these findings, we propose the
OSRAM-CO$_2$-SM process in which CO$_2$ shall be used as the decarburising
agent. CO$_2$ is to be passed into a specially designed converter provided with
heating mechanism to maintain the contents from blast furnace in a molten state

to be burnt in a combustion chamber with stochiometric proportions of pure
O$_2$ to produce CO$_2$ at a partial pressure close to 1 atm.The process will
be extremely useful as it involves reuse and recycle of CO$_2$ and in turn
would reduce the overall amount of CO$_2$ discharged into the atmosphere.

i.e. the channel losses at the cell boarder. Therefore, huge number
(theoretically any number) of terminals could be supported concurrently at
finite and small downlink power budget. This could be very useful to support
the downlink signalling channels in HSPA+, LTE, and 5G. It can be very useful
also to support huge D2D communication downlinks. Moreover, and based on the
same concept, a new system configuration for a single link point-to-point
communication has been presented. With this new configuration, the achieved
data rate becomes independent of the required transmit power. This means that
any data rate can be achieved at the target BER and with small and finite

following question: given certain time average quality of service (QoS) targets
for the UTs, what is the minimum transmit power expenditure with which they can
be met? Our motivation to consider time average QoS constraint comes from the
fact that modern wireless applications such as file sharing, multi-media etc.
allow some flexibility in terms of their delay tolerance. Time average QoS
constraints can lead to greater transmit power savings as compared to
instantaneous QoS constraints since it provides the flexibility to dynamically
allocate resources over the fading channel states. We formulate the problem as
a stochastic optimization problem whose solution is the design of the downlink
beamforming vectors during each time slot. We solve this problem using the
approach of Lyapunov optimization and characterize the performance of the
proposed algorithm. With this algorithm as the reference, we present two main
contributions that incorporate practical design considerations in SCNs. First,
we analyze the impact of delays incurred in information exchange between the
SCBSs. Second, we impose channel state information (CSI) feedback constraints,
and formulate a joint CSI feedback and beamforming strategy. In both cases, we
provide performance bounds of the algorithm in terms of satisfying the QoS
constraints and the time average power expenditure. Our simulation results show
that solving the problem with time average QoS constraints provide greater
savings in the transmit power as compared to the instantaneous QoS constraints.

block-fading channel, with and without channel state information (CSI) at the
receiver. No feedback is assumed. It is well known that the ratio between the
minimum energy per bit and the noise level converges to $-1.59$ dB as $k$ goes
to infinity, regardless of whether CSI is available at the receiver or not.
This paper shows that lack of CSI at the receiver causes a slowdown in the
speed of convergence to $-1.59$ dB as $k\to\infty$ compared to the case of
perfect receiver CSI. Specifically, we show that, in the no-CSI case, the gap
to $-1.59$ dB is proportional to $((\log k) /k)^{1/3}$, whereas when perfect
CSI is available at the receiver, this gap is proportional to $1/\sqrt{k}$. In
both cases, the gap to $-1.59$ dB is independent of the number of transmit
antennas and of the channel's coherence time. Numerically, we observe that,
when the receiver is equipped with a single antenna, to achieve an energy per
bit of $ - 1.5$ dB in the no-CSI case, one needs to transmit at least $7\times
10^7$ information bits, whereas $6\times 10^4$ bits suffice for the case of
perfect CSI at the receiver.

useful tool to characterize structures in several knowledge fields. An
important problem is to establish whether or not a given cluster algebra is of
finite type. Using the standard definition, the problem is infeasible since it
uses mutations that can lead to an infinite process. Barot, Geiss and
Zelevinsky (2006) presented an easier way to verify if a given algebra is of
finite type, by testing that all chordless cycles of the graph related to the
algebra are cyclically oriented and that there exists a positive quasi-Cartan
companion of the skew-symmetrizable matrix related to the algebra. We develop
an algorithm that verifies these conditions and decides whether or not a
cluster algebra is of finite type in polynomial time. The second part of the
algorithm is used to prove that the more general problem to decide if a matrix
has a positive quasi-Cartan companion is in NP.

Observatory/COMPTEL, which was Compton Camera (CC), detected mere $\sim30$
persistent sources. It is in stark contrast with $\sim$2000 sources in the GeV
band. Here we report the performance of an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera
(ETCC), and prove that it has a good potential to break through this stagnation
in MeV gamma-ray astronomy. The ETCC provides all the parameters of
Compton-scattering by measuring 3-D recoil electron tracks; then the Scatter
Plane Deviation (SPD) lost in CCs is recovered. The energy loss rate (dE/dx),
which CCs cannot measure, is also obtained, and is found to be indeed helpful
to reduce the background under conditions similar to space. Accordingly the
significance in gamma detection is improved severalfold. On the other hand, SPD
is essential to determine the point-spread function (PSF) quantitatively. The
SPD resolution is improved close to the theoretical limit for multiple
scattering of recoil electrons. With such a well-determined PSF, we demonstrate
for the first time that it is possible to provide reliable sensitivity in
Compton imaging without utilizing an optimization algorithm. As such, this
study highlights the fundamental weak-points of CCs. In contrast we demonstrate
the possibility of ETCC reaching the sensitivity below $1\times10^{-12}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 MeV.

normal state instabilities -- SDW magnetism and nematic order, and
superconductivity, all three as the consequences of the instability of a Fermi
surface due to interactions between low-energy fermionic quasiparticles. This
approach assumes that renormalizations coming from fermions from high energies,
of order bandwidth, modify but do not destroy Fermi liquid behavior in the
normal state and can be absorbed into the effective low-energy model of
interacting fermions located near hole and electron-type Fermi surfaces. I
argue that the interactions between these fermions are responsible for (i) a
stripe-type SDW magnetic order (and, in some cases, a checkerboard order), (ii)
a preliminary nematic-type instability, in which magnetic fluctuations break
$C_4$ lattice rotational symmetry down to $C_2$, but magnetic order does not
yet develop, and (iii) a superconductivity, which competes with these two
orders. The experimental data on superconductivity show rich behavior with
potentially different symmetry of a superconducting state even for different
compositions of the same material. I argue that, despite all this, the physics
of superconductivity in the itinerant scenario for Fe-based materials is
governed by a single underlying pairing mechanism.

accounting of all the thimbles giving a contribution to the partition function

somehow more realistic setting, giving us once again the chance to tackle the

solution? how can we make sure that we correctly sample configurations on the

condensate), we can verify that, in the region of parameters we studied, only
one thimble contributes and that the algorithmic solution that we set up works

the recurrent transfer of atoms via a diffusive process from the amorphous

which explains the energy balance and the interfacial growth velocities
governing grain growth. For the $\langle111\rangle$ crystallographic
orientation, we find a degenerate atomic rearrangement process, with two
zero-energy modes corresponding to a perfect crystalline structure and the
formation of a $\Sigma3$ twin boundary. Continued growth in this direction
results in the development a twin network, in contrast with all other growth
orientations, where the crystal grows defect-free. This particular mechanism of
crystallization from amorphous phases is also observed during solid-phase
epitaxial growth of $\langle111\rangle$ semiconductor crystals, where growth is
restrained to one dimension. We calculate the equivalent X-ray diffraction

$\rho= \lim p/n$ is the phase transition parameter and the SIR estimator is
consistent if and only if $\rho= 0$. When dimension $p$ is greater than $n$, we
propose a diagonal thresholding screening SIR (DT-SIR) algorithm. This method
provides us with an estimate of the eigen-space of the covariance matrix of the
conditional expectation $var(\mathbf{E}[\boldsymbol{x}|y])$. The desired
dimension reduction space is then obtained by multiplying the inverse of the
covariance matrix on the eigen-space. Under certain sparsity assumptions on
both the covariance matrix of predictors and the loadings of the directions, we
prove the consistency of DT-SIR in estimating the dimension reduction space in
high dimensional data analysis. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate
superior performances of the proposed method in comparison to its competitors.

reversible character. The source of the local irreversibility seems to be not
in the laws themselves but in the initial and boundary conditions of the
equations that represent the laws. In this work we propose that the screening
of currents by black hole event horizons determines, locally, a preferred
direction for the flux of electromagnetic energy. We study the growth of black
hole event horizons due to the cosmological expansion and accretion of cosmic
microwave background radiation, for different cosmological models. We propose
generalized McVittie co-moving metrics and integrate the rate of accretion of
cosmic microwave background radiation onto a supermassive black hole over
cosmic time. We find that for flat, open, and closed Friedmann cosmological
models, the ratio of the total area of the black hole event horizons with
respect to the area of a radial co-moving space-like hypersurface always
increases. Since accretion of cosmic radiation sets an absolute lower limit to
the total matter accreted by black holes, this implies that the causal past and
future are not mirror symmetric for any spacetime event. The asymmetry causes a
net Poynting flux in the global future direction; the latter is in turn related
to the ever increasing thermodynamic entropy. Thus, we expose a connection
between four different ""time arrows"": cosmological, electromagnetic,

changes in road density. From this second component, we introduce two new
indices, density index and decay index, which jointly capture essential
characteristics of urban systems and therefore can help us gain new insights
into how cities evolve.

  Operational Power Grids",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrical power grids are vulnerable to cascading failures that can lead to
large blackouts. Detection and prevention of cascading failures in power grids
is impor- tant. Currently, grid operators mainly monitor the state (loading
level) of individual components in power grids. The complex architecture of
power grids, with many interdependencies, makes it difficult to aggregate data
provided by local compo- nents in a timely manner and meaningful way:
monitoring the resilience with re- spect to cascading failures of an
operational power grid is a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge. The
main ideas behind the paper are that (i) a robustness metric based on both the
topology and the operative state of the power grid can be used to quantify
power grid robustness and (ii) a new proposed a distributed computation method
with self-stabilizing properties can be used to achieving near real-time
monitoring of the robustness of the power grid. Our con- tributions thus
provide insight into the resilience with respect to cascading failures of a
dynamic operational power grid at runtime, in a scalable and robust way. Com-
putations are pushed into the network, making the results available at each
node, allowing automated distributed control mechanisms to be implemented on
top.

The model's agents differ continuously in their ability to make rational
choices. The agents' objective is to ensure their individual survival over time
or, equivalently, to maximize profits. In equilibrium, however, rational agents
who maximize their objective survival probability are, individually and
collectively, eliminated by the forces of competition. Instead of rationality,
there emerges a unique distribution of irrational players who are individually
not fit for the struggle of survival. The selection of irrational players over
rational ones relies on the fact that all rational players coordinate on the
same optimal action, which leaves them collectively undiversified and thus
vulnerable to aggregate risks.

particularly challenging for such an abstract subject. Advancements in
technology and, taking the student as the focus of his own learning, led to a
change of paradigm in the design and development of educational contents. In
this paper we describe the first experience with an interactive feedback and
assessment tool (Siacua), based on parameterized math exercises, and explain
how we use it to motivate student independent study in a multivariate calculus
environment. We have defined an index about the subject, trying to make it
consensual enough for being used in other courses about multivariate calculus.
Then we have created a concept map, selected some existing parameterized
true/false questions from PmatE project and classified them using our concept
map, for being reused in our system. For complementing the course we have
created about one hundred parameterized multiple choice question templates in
system Megua and generated about one thousand instances for using in Siacua.
Results based on data collected by this tool and also based on an informal
survey are presented. This first experience allows us to conclude our approach
has an important impact on student motivation and contributes to the success on
learning multivariate calculus.

range of validity of the model assumptions, the computational results show

physics. One of the cornerstones of GR, as well as Newton's theory of gravity,
is the weak equivalence principle (WEP), stating that the trajectory of a
freely falling test body is independent of its internal structure and
composition. WEP is known to be valid for the normal matter with a high
precision. However, due to the rarity of antimatter and weakness of the
gravitational forces, the WEP has never been confirmed for antimatter. The
current direct bounds on the ratio between the gravitational and inertial
masses of the antihydrogen do not rule out a repulsive nature for the
antimatter gravity. Here we establish an indirect bound of 0.13% on the
difference between the gravitational and inertial masses of the positron
(antielectron) from the analysis of synchrotron losses at the Large
Electron-Positron collider (LEP). This serves as a confirmation of the
conventional gravitational properties of antimatter without common assumptions
such as, e.g., coupling of gravity to virtual particles, dynamics of distant
astrophysical sources and the nature of absolute gravitational potentials.
