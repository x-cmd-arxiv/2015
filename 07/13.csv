properties. The response of such systems to positive initial conditions and
positive inputs remain in the nonnegative orthant of the state space. Although
positive observers have been designed for positive systems, they are unable to
estimate the states when unknown inputs or disturbances are present in the
systems. This paper is a first attempt to design positive unknown input
observers (PUIO) for positive linear systems. The structural constraints on
observer parameters make the design task cumbersome. However, with the aid of a
positive stabilization scheme via LMI and by imposing conditions on positivity
of the generalized inverse associated with a certain design matrix, we provide
a reliable procedure for the design of PUIOs.

that the broad-band energy spectral distributions for all evolutinary states

from the seed photons coming from a neutron star (NS) atmosphere at a
temperature kT_{s1}<1.5 keV (herein Comptb) and a second resulting from the
seed photons of T_{s2}~1.1-1.3 keV coming from the disk (herein Comptb2). We
found that we needed to add a low-temperature blackbody and an iron-line
({Gaussian}) component to the model in order to obtain high-quality fits. The
data analysis using this model indicates that the power-law photon index
Gamma_{1} of our model is always about 2, independently of the spectral state.
Another parameter, Gamma_{2} demonstrates a two-phase behavior depending on the
spectral state. Gamma_{2} is quasi-constant at Gamma_{2}~ 2 when the electron
temperature kT^{(2)}_e<80 keV and Gamma_{2} is less than 2, in the range of
1.3<Gamma_{2}<2, when kT^{(2)}_e>80 keV. This phase is similar to that was
previously found in the Z-source Sco X-1. We interpret the decreasing index
phase using a model in which a super-Eddington radiation pressure from the
neutron star causes an expansion of the Compton cloud similar to that found
previously in Sco~X-1 during the Flaring branch.

nanoconfined water confined between two hydrophilic surfaces measured by
small-amplitude dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM). Explicitly considering
the instantaneous tip-surface separation during squeezeout, we confirm the
existence of an adsorbed molecular water layer on mica and at least two
hydration layers. We also confirm the previous observation of a sharp
transition in the viscoelastic response of the nanoconfined water as the
compression rate is increased beyond a critical value (previously determined to
be about 0.8 nm/s). We find that below the critical value, the tip passes
smoothly through the molecular layers of the film, while above the critical
speed, the tip encounters ""pinning"" at separations where the film is able to
temporarily order. Pre-ordering of the film is accompanied by increased force
fluctuations, which lead to increased damping preceding a peak in the film
stiffness once ordering is completed. We analyze the data using both
Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell viscoelastic models. This provides a complementary
picture of the viscoelastic response of the confined water film.

determine the slope, $S$, and intercept, $I$, of the log$(\langle

limitation of this procedure. It is found that the reduced $\chi^2$ of the
fitting decreases with the increase of the Hurst index, $H$ (the expectation
value of $S$), which may be attributed to the correlation among the re-scaled
ranges. Similarly, it is found that the errors of the fitting parameters $S$

results show the limitation of using the simple least square method to
determine the dimension of a fractal time series. Nevertheless, they may be
used to reinterpret the fitting results of the least square method to determine
the dimension of fractal Brownian motions more self-consistently. The currency
exchange rate between Euro and Dollar is used as an example to demonstrate this
procedure and a fractal dimension of 1.511 is obtained for spans greater than

multi-user coding techniques exist, in practical scenarios, not all users can
be scheduled simultaneously. Thus, a key problem is which users to schedule in
a given time slot. Under realistic approach for time dependency of the channel,
we adopt a distributed scheduling algorithm in which each user, in the
beginning of each slot, estimates his channel gain and compares it to a
threshold, and if exceeding it the user can transmit. In this work we are
interested in the expected capacity of the system and the delay and quality of
service of the data accumulated at the users under this scheduling scheme.
First we derive the expected capacity under scheduling (distributed and
centralized) for this time dependent environment and show that its scaling law
is $O(\sigma_g\sqrt{2\log K}+\mu_g)$, were $\sigma_g, \mu_g$ are the good
channel parameters (assuming Gaussian capacity approximation, e.g., under MIMO)
and $K$ is the number of users. Then we turn to the performance analysis of
such system while assuming the users are not necessarily fully backlogged, and
focus specifically on the queueing problem and the strong dependence between
the queues which leave no alternative but to turn to approximate models for
this system. We adopt the celebrated model of Ephremides and Zhu to give new
results on the convergence of the probability of collision to its average value
(as the number of users grows), and hence for the ensuing system performance
metrics, such as throughput and delay. We further utilize this finding to
suggest a much simpler approximate model, which accurately describes the system
behavior when the number of queues is large. The system performance as
predicted by the approximate models shows excellent agreement with simulation
results.

consider non-parametric estimation of the density $f_0$ of its jump sizes, as
well as of its intensity $\lambda_0.$ We take a Bayesian approach to the
problem and specify the prior on $f_0$ as the Dirichlet location mixture of
normal densities. An independent prior for $\lambda_0$ is assumed to be
compactly supported and to possess a positive density with respect to the
Lebesgue measure. We show that under suitable assumptions the posterior
contracts around the pair $(\lambda_0,f_0)$ at essentially (up to a logarithmic
factor) the $\sqrt{n\Delta}$-rate, where $n$ is the number of observations and
$\Delta$ is the mesh size at which the process is sampled. The emphasis is on
high frequency data, $\Delta\to 0$, but the obtained results are also valid for
fixed $\Delta$. In either case we assume that $n\Delta\rightarrow\infty$. Our
main result implies existence of Bayesian point estimates converging (in the
frequentist sense, in probability) to $(\lambda_0,f_0)$ at the same rate.
  We also discuss a practical implementation of our approach. The computational
problem is dealt with by inclusion of auxiliary variables and we develop a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that samples from the joint distribution of
the unknown parameters in the mixture density and the introduced auxiliary
variables. Numerical examples illustrate the feasibility of this approach.

optimization problem based on knowledge of its optimal solutions. This paper
considers inverse optimization in the setting where measurements of the optimal
solutions of a convex optimization problem are corrupted by noise. We first
provide a formulation for inverse optimization and prove it to be NP-hard. In
contrast to existing methods, we show that the parameter estimates produced by
our formulation are statistically consistent. Our approach involves combining a
new duality-based reformulation for bilevel programs with a regularization
scheme that smooths discontinuities in the formulation. Using epi-convergence
theory, we show the regularization parameter can be adjusted to approximate the
original inverse optimization problem to arbitrary accuracy, which we use to
prove our consistency results. Next, we propose two solution algorithms based
on our duality-based formulation. The first is an enumeration algorithm that is
applicable to settings where the dimensionality of the parameter space is
modest, and the second is a semiparametric approach that combines nonparametric
statistics with a modified version of our formulation. These numerical
algorithms are shown to maintain the statistical consistency of the underlying
formulation. Lastly, using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that
our approach performs competitively when compared with existing heuristics.

problem introduced by Montanari and Richard: Given a order-$3$ tensor $T$ of
the form $T = \tau \cdot v_0^{\otimes 3} + A$, where $\tau \geq 0$ is a
signal-to-noise ratio, $v_0$ is a unit vector, and $A$ is a random noise
tensor, the goal is to recover the planted vector $v_0$. For the case that $A$
has iid standard Gaussian entries, we give an efficient algorithm to recover
$v_0$ whenever $\tau \geq \omega(n^{3/4} \log(n)^{1/4})$, and certify that the
recovered vector is close to a maximum likelihood estimator, all with high
probability over the random choice of $A$. The previous best algorithms with
provable guarantees required $\tau \geq \Omega(n)$.
  In the regime $\tau \leq o(n)$, natural tensor-unfolding-based spectral
relaxations for the underlying optimization problem break down (in the sense
that their integrality gap is large). To go beyond this barrier, we use convex
relaxations based on the sum-of-squares method. Our recovery algorithm proceeds
by rounding a degree-$4$ sum-of-squares relaxations of the
maximum-likelihood-estimation problem for the statistical model. To complement
our algorithmic results, we show that degree-$4$ sum-of-squares relaxations
break down for $\tau \leq O(n^{3/4}/\log(n)^{1/4})$, which demonstrates that
improving our current guarantees (by more than logarithmic factors) would
require new techniques or might even be intractable.
  Finally, we show how to exploit additional problem structure in order to
solve our sum-of-squares relaxations, up to some approximation, very
efficiently. Our fastest algorithm runs in nearly-linear time using shifted
(matrix) power iteration and has similar guarantees as above. The analysis of
this algorithm also confirms a variant of a conjecture of Montanari and Richard
about singular vectors of tensor unfoldings.

sequence of simplicial groups, and a stationary dimension group is such an
inductive limit in which the homomorphism is the same at every stage. If a
simple dimension group is stationary then up to scalar multiplication it admits
a unique trace (positive real-valued homomorphism), but the short exact
sequence associated to this trace need not split. In an earlier paper,
Handelman described these ordered groups concretely in the case when the trace
has trivial kernel---i.e., the group is totally ordered---and in the case when
the group is free. The main result here is a concrete description of how a
stationary simple dimension group is built from the kernel and image of its
trace. Specifically, every stationary simple dimension group contains the
direct sum of the kernel of its trace with a copy of the image, and is
generated by that direct sum and finitely many extra elements. Moreover, any
ordered abelian group of this description is stationary.
  The following interesting fact is proved along the way to the main result:
given any positive integer m and any square integer matrix B, there are two
distinct integer powers of B, the difference of which has all entries divisible
by m.

minus corresponding climatological values, is calculated over a summation
interval of length from 1 to 365 days. A ""quality criterion"" selects datasets

thus defining a class of decision-supporting superinformation theories. This
broadens the domain of applicability of that argument to cover

The principal innovation in these algorithms is that they are block-iterative

Deterministic strategies are used to select the blocks of operators activated

convergence is guaranteed without additional assumptions. Neither algorithm
requires prior knowledge of bounds on the linear operators involved or the

non-volatile memory (NVM) have been proposed to exploit both the capacity
advantage of NVM and the latency and dynamic energy advantages of DRAM. An
important problem for such systems is how to place data between DRAM and NVM to
improve system performance.
  In this paper, we devise the first mechanism, called UBM (page Utility Based
hybrid Memory management), that systematically estimates the system performance
benefit of placing a page in DRAM versus NVM and uses this estimate to guide
data placement. UBM's estimation method consists of two major components.
First, it estimates how much an application's stall time can be reduced if the
accessed page is placed in DRAM. To do this, UBM comprehensively considers
access frequency, row buffer locality, and memory level parallelism (MLP) to
estimate the application's stall time reduction. Second, UBM estimates how much
each application's stall time reduction contributes to overall system
performance. Based on this estimation method, UBM can determine and place the
most critical data in DRAM to directly optimize system performance.
Experimental results show that UBM improves system performance by 14% on
average (and up to 39%) compared to the best of three state-of-the-art
mechanisms for a large number of data-intensive workloads from the SPEC CPU2006
and Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) suites.

are realized by the random mixture of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic

randomness and frustration are not caused by the presence of FM and AF
couplings. To further elaborate this type of system, here we study Heisenberg
model on AF SFN and search for the SG phase. The canonical SG Heisenberg model
is not observed in $d$-dimensional regular lattices for ($d \leq 3$). We can
make an analogy for the connectivity density ($m$) of SFN with the
dimensionality of the regular lattice. It should be plausible to find the
critical value of $m$ for the existence of SG behaviour, analogous to the lower
critical dimension ($d_l$) for the canonical SG systems. Here we study system
with $m=2,3,4$ and $5$. We used Replica Exchange algorithm of Monte Carlo
Method and calculated the SG order parameter. We observed SG phase for each
value of $m$ and estimated its corersponding critical temperature.

nucleation rate and improve the classical formula using a new prefactor in the
nucleation rate. Most of the previous theoretical studies have used the
constant prefactor determined by the bubble growth due to the evaporation
process from the bubble surface. However, the growth of bubbles is also
regulated by the thermal conduction, the viscosity, and the inertia of liquid
motion. These effects can decrease the prefactor significantly, especially when
the liquid pressure is much smaller than the equilibrium one. The deviation in
the nucleation rate between the improved formula and the CNT can be as large as
several orders of magnitude. Our improved, accurate prefactor and recent
advances in molecular dynamics simulations and laboratory experiments for argon
bubble nucleation enable us to precisely constrain the free energy barrier for
bubble nucleation. Assuming the correction to the CNT free energy is of the
functional form suggested by Tolman, the precise evaluations of the free energy
barriers suggest the Tolman length is $\simeq 0.3 \sigma$ independently of the
temperature for argon bubble nucleation, where $\sigma$ is the unit length of
the Lenard-Jones potential. With this Tolman correction and our new prefactor
one gets accurate bubble nucleation rate predictions in the parameter range
probed by current experiments and molecular dynamics simulations.

fast spiking interneurons, and investigate the effect of inter-modular
connection on emergence of fast sparsely synchronized rhythms by varying both
the inter-modular coupling strength $J_{inter}$ and the average number of
inter-modular links per interneuron $M_{syn}^{(inter)}$. In contrast to the
case of non-clustered networks, two kinds of sparsely synchronized states such
as modular and global synchronization are found. For the case of modular sparse
synchronization, the population behavior reveals the modular structure, because
the intra-modular dynamics of sub-networks make some mismatching. On the other
hand, in the case of global sparse synchronization, the population behavior is
globally identical, independently of the cluster structure, because the
intra-modular dynamics of sub-networks make perfect matching. We introduce a
realistic cross-correlation modularity measure, representing the
matching-degree between the instantaneous sub-population spike rates of the
sub-networks, and examine whether the sparse synchronization is global or
modular. Furthermore, we characterize the modular and global sparse
synchronization by employing the realistic sub- and whole-population order
parameters and statistical-mechanical measures. The roles of $J_{inter}$ and
$M_{syn}^{(inter)}$ are thus found as follows. For large $J_{inter}$, due to
strong inhibition it plays a destructive role to ""spoil"" the pacing between
spikes, while for small $J_{inter}$ it plays a constructive role to ""favor"" the
pacing between spikes. In contrast, $M_{syn}^{(inter)}$ seems to play a role
just to favor the pacing between spikes. With increasing $M_{syn}^{(inter)}$,
the pacing degree between spikes increases monotonically thanks to the increase
in the degree of effectiveness of global communication between spikes.

rules, except for nine out of the total $2^{16}-1$ possible nonempty sets of
binary Boolean functions, whether the induced chain is absorbing has nothing to
do with the topology of the underlying interaction graph, as long as
connectivity is assumed. These results illustrate possibilities of {relating
dynamical} properties of Boolean networks to graphical properties of the
underlying interactions.

is generalized to obtain a straightforward, surprisingly accurate, and scalable
numerical representation for calculating the electronic wave functions of
molecules. It uses a basis set of product sinc functions arrayed on a Cartesian
grid, and yields 1 kcal/mol precision for valence transition energies with a
grid resolution of approximately 0.1 bohr. The Coulomb matrix elements are
replaced with matrix elements obtained from the kinetic energy operator. A
resolution-of-the-identity approximation renders the primitive one- and
two-electron matrix elements diagonal; in other words, the Coulomb operator is
local with respect to the grid indices. The calculation of contracted
two-electron matrix elements among orbitals requires only O(N log(N))
multiplication operations, not O(N^4), where N is the number of basis
functions; N = n^3 on cubic grids. The representation not only is numerically
expedient, but also produces energies and properties superior to those
calculated variationally. Absolute energies, absorption cross sections,
transition energies, and ionization potentials are reported for one- (He^+,
H_2^+ ), two- (H_2, He), ten- (CH_4) and 56-electron (C_8H_8) systems.

observed to have characteristic dust extinction curves that are quite different
from those of the Galaxy (e.g., strength of the 2175 A bump). Although the dust
composition and size distribution of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) that can
self-consistently explain their observed extinction curves have been already
proposed, it remain unclear whether and how the required dust properties can be
achieved in the formation histories of the MCs. We therefore investigate the
time evolution of the dust properties of the MCs and thereby derive their
extinction curves using one-zone chemical evolution models with formation and
evolution of small and large silicate and carbonaceous dust grains and dusty
winds associated with starburst events. We find that the observed SMC
extinction curve without a conspicuous 2175 A bump can be reproduced well by
our SMC model, if the small carbon grains can be selectively lost through the
dust wind during the latest starburst about 0.2 Gyr ago. We also find that the
LMC extinction curve with a weak 2175 A bump can be reproduced by our LMC model
with less efficient removal of dust through dust wind. We discuss possible
physical reasons for different dust wind efficiencies between silicate and
graphite and among galaxies.

that combines traditional marketing via content providers and viral marketing
to consumers in social networks in a single framework. In AIM, a set of content
providers and consumers form a bipartite network while consumers also form
their social network, and influence propagates from the content providers to
consumers and among consumers in the social network following the independent
cascade model. An advertiser needs to select a subset of seed content providers
and a subset of seed consumers, such that the influence from the seed providers
passing through the seed consumers could reach a large number of consumers in
the social network in expectation.
  We prove that the AIM problem is NP-hard to approximate to within any
constant factor via a reduction from Feige's k-prover proof system for 3-SAT5.
We also give evidence that even when the social network graph is trivial (i.e.
has no edges), a polynomial time constant factor approximation for AIM is
unlikely. However, when we assume that the weighted bi-adjacency matrix that
describes the influence of content providers on consumers is of constant rank,
a common assumption often used in recommender systems, we provide a
polynomial-time algorithm that achieves approximation ratio of
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)^3$ for any (polynomially small) $\epsilon > 0$. Our
algorithmic results still hold for a more general model where cascades in
social network follow a general monotone and submodular function.

finite precision. The ability to reason about rounding is especially important
if one wants to explore a range of potential representations, for instance for
FPGAs or custom hardware implementations. This problem becomes challenging when
the program does not employ solely linear operations, and non-linearities are
inherent to many interesting computational problems in real-world applications.
  Existing solutions to reasoning possibly lead to either inaccurate bounds or
high analysis time in the presence of nonlinear correlations between variables.
Furthermore, while it is easy to implement a straightforward method such as
interval arithmetic, sophisticated techniques are less straightforward to
implement in a formal setting. Thus there is a need for methods which output
certificates that can be formally validated inside a proof assistant.
  We present a framework to provide upper bounds on absolute roundoff errors of
floating-point nonlinear programs. This framework is based on optimization
techniques employing semidefinite programming and sums of squares certificates,
which can be checked inside the Coq theorem prover to provide formal roundoff
error bounds for polynomial programs. Our tool covers a wide range of nonlinear
programs, including polynomials and transcendental operations as well as
conditional statements. We illustrate the efficiency and precision of this tool
on non-trivial programs coming from biology, optimization and space control.
Our tool produces more accurate error bounds for 23% of all programs and yields
better performance in 66% of all programs.

be different for different types of galaxies. While a Na D excess seems to be
related with the interstellar medium (ISM) in late-type galaxies,
smooth-looking early-type NEOs show little or no dust extinction and hence no
compelling sign of ISM contributions. To further test this finding, we measured
the doppler components in the Na D lines. We hypothesized that ISM would have a
better (albeit not definite) chance of showing a blueshift doppler departure
from the bulk of the stellar population due to outflow caused by either star
formation or AGN activities. Many of the late-type NEOs clearly show blueshift
in their Na D lines, which is consistent with the former interpretation that
the Na D excess found in them is related with star formation-caused gas
outflow. On the contrary, smooth-looking early-type NEOs do not show any
notable doppler component, which is also consistent with the interpretation of
Jeong et al. that the Na D excess in early-type NEOs is likely not related with

delocalized Kohn-Sham orbitals for insulators and semiconductors with $\Gamma$
point sampling of the Brillouin zone. In this work we generalize the SCDM
method to Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations with k-point
sampling of the Brillouin zone, which is needed for more general electronic
structure calculations for solids. We demonstrate that our new method, called
SCDM-k, is by construction gauge independent and is a natural way to describe
localized orbitals. SCDM-k computes localized orbitals without the use of an
optimization procedure, and thus does not suffer from the possibility of being
trapped in a local minimum. Furthermore, the computational complexity of using
SCDM-k to construct orthogonal and localized orbitals scales as O(N log N )
where N is the total number of k-points in the Brillouin zone. SCDM-k is
therefore efficient even when a large number of k-points are used for Brillouin
zone sampling. We demonstrate the numerical performance of SCDM-k using systems
with model potentials in two and three dimensions.

transform magnitude data is known to suffer from the twin image problem. In
particular, when the object support is centro-symmetric, the iterative solution
often stagnates such that the resultant complex image contains the features of
both the desired solution and its inverted and complex-conjugated replica. The
conventional approach to address the twin image problem is to modify the object
support during initial iterations which can possibly lead to elimination of one
of the twin images. However, at present there seems to be no deterministic
procedure to make sure that the twin image will always be very weak or absent.
In this work we make an important observation that the ideal solution without
the twin image is typically more sparse (in some suitable transform domain) as
compared to the stagnated solution containing the twin image. We further show
that introducing a sparsity enhancing step in the iterative algorithm can
address the twin image problem without the need to change the object support
throughout the iterative process even when the object support is
centro-symmetric. In a simulation study, we use binary and gray-scale pure
phase objects and illustrate the effectiveness of the sparsity assisted phase
recovery in the context of the twin image problem. The results have important
implications for a wide range of topics in Physics where the phase retrieval

equations in Hilbert spaces is considered. The main subject of this article
concerns conditions for convergence of the associated discretized minimum-norm
least-squares solution to the exact solution using exact attainable data. The
two cases of global convergence (convergence for all exact solution) or local
convergence (convergence for a specific exact solution) are investigated. We
review the existing results and prove new equivalent condition when the
discretized solution always converges to the exact solution. An important tool
is to recognize the discrete solution operator as oblique projection. Hence,
global convergence can be characterized by certain subspaces having uniformly
bounded angles. We furthermore derive practically useful conditions when this
holds and put them into the context of known results. For local convergence we
generalize results on the characterization of weak or strong convergence and
state some new sufficient conditions. We furthermore provide an example of a
bounded sequence of discretized solutions which does not converge at all, not
even weakly.

particle-swarm optimization algorithm and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics.
Our global structural search finds a more stable reconstructed (Rec) structure
than that was reported before. With correction for vacancy formation energy, we
demonstrate that the experimental observed surface reconstruction occurred at
the earlier stages of graphene formation: 1) reconstruction occurred when C60
adsorption (before decomposition to form graphene) for C60 as a molecular
precursor, or 2) reconstruction occurred when there were (partial) hydrogens
retain in the adsorbed carbon structures for C2H4 and C60H30 as precursors. The
reason can be attributed to that the energy gain, from the strengthened Pt-C
bonding for C of C60 or for C with partial H, compensates the energy cost of
formation surface vacancies and makes the reconstruction feasible, especially
at elevated temperatures. In the Rec structure, two Pt-C covalent bonds are
formed per unit cell, which have a great impact on the adsorbed Gr electronic
structures.

known to exist in the vicinity of the MIT. The results are obtained by a

the femtosecond dynamics of sub-nanometer spin-spin correlations and,
ultimately, of the exchange energy. With this approach it becomes possible to

investigate open electron systems far from equilibrium. However, this method is
limited to situations where interactions between electrons can be ignored, or
considered perturbatively. Fortunately, this is the case in a broad class of
metallic systems, which are commonly described by the Fermi liquid theory. Yet,
there exist another broad class of electron systems of reduced dimensionality,
the so-called Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, where interactions are effectively
strong and cannot be neglected even at low energies. Nevertheless, strong
interactions can be accounted exactly using the bosonization technique, which
utilizes the free-bosonic character of collective excitations in these systems.

thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for the single impurity Anderson model,
focusing on the Kondo regime. For this we construct the complete eigenbasis of
the Hamiltonian using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method in the
language of the matrix product states. It is a peculiarity of the NRG that
while the Wilson chain is supposed to describe a macroscopic bath, very few
single particle excitations already suffice to essentially thermalize the
impurity system at finite temperature, which amounts to having added a
macroscopic amount of energy. Thus given an initial state of the system such as
the ground state together with microscopic excitations, we calculate the
spectral function of the impurity using the microcanonical and diagonal and
grand canonical ensembles. By adding or removing particles at a certain Wilson
energy shell on top of the ground state, we find qualitative agreement between
the spectral functions calculated for different ensembles. This indicates that
the system thermalizes in the long-time limit, and can be described by an
appropriate statistical-mechanical ensemble. Moreover, by calculating the
impurity spectral density at the Fermi level and the dot occupancy for energy
eigenstates relevant for microcanonical ensemble, we find good support for ETH.
The ultimate mechanism responsible for this effective thermalization within the
NRG can be identified as Anderson orthogonality: the more charge that needs to
flow to or from infinity after applying a local excitation within the Wilson
chain, the more the system looks thermal afterwards at an increased
temperature. For the same reason, however, thermalization fails if charge
rearrangement after the excitation remains mostly local.

to tune the scattering length toward the unitary limit. In this work we analyze
a particular path in which the length $r_B=a-a_B$, measuring the difference
between the two-body scattering length $a$ and the energy scattering length
$a_B$, results almost constant. Analyzing systems with very different scales,
as atomic or nuclear systems, we observe that the finite-range parameter
remains almost constant along the path with a numerical value of
$\Gamma_0^3\approx 0.87$ for the ground state level. This observation suggests
the possibility of constructing a single universal function that incorporate
finite-range effects for this class of paths. The result is used to estimate
the three-body parameter $\kappa_*$ in the case of real atomic systems brought

been studied in the framework of density functional theory. We have observed a
charge transfer from the metal/film interface to the Cu atom and investigated
its relation to surface and interface deformations. We find that a weak
interaction between the metal and the film is a promising prerequisite for
adatom charging. The detailed study of Cu/NaF/Mo and NaF/Mo indicates that the
distortion of the NaF film caused by the Cu adsorption has essentially
anharmonic character, as it is coupled to a strong charge redistribution in the
system.

wave transport in complex media, including solid-state and biological systems.
Recent work has predicted that coupling between noisy environments and
disordered systems, in which coherent transport has been arrested due to
localization effects, could actually enhance transport. Photonic integrated
circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal
being the development of large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity
control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the
role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor consisting
of a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond
timescales. Over 64,400 transport experiments, we observe several distinct
transport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the
''quantum Goldilocks'' regime in strong, statically disordered discrete-time
systems. Low loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this
nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation
experiments.

a patrolling problem is specified by a set $U$ of nodes (admissible defender's
positions), a set $T \subseteq U$ of vulnerable targets, an admissible
defender's moves over $U$, and a function which to every target assigns the
time needed to complete an intrusion at it. The goal is to design an optimal
strategy for a defender who is moving from node to node and aims at detecting
possible intrusions at the targets. The goal of the attacker is to maximize the
probability of a successful attack. We assume that the attacker is adversarial,
i.e., he knows the strategy of the defender and can observe her moves.
  We prove that the defender has an optimal strategy for every patrolling
problem. Further, we show that for every $\varepsilon$ > 0, there exists a
finite-memory $\varepsilon$-optimal strategy for the defender constructible in
exponential time, and we observe that such a strategy cannot be computed in
polynomial time unless P=NP.
  Then we focus ourselves to unrestricted defender's moves. Here, a patrolling
problem is fully determined by its signature, the number of targets of each
attack length. We bound the maximal probability of successfully defended
attacks. Then, we introduce a decomposition method which allows to split a
given patrolling problem $G$ into smaller subproblems and construct a
defender's strategy for $G$ by ""composing"" the strategies constructed for these
subproblems.
  Finally, for patrolling problems with $T = U$ and a well-formed signature, we
give an exact classification of all sufficiently connected environments where
the defender can achieve the same value as in the fully connected uniform
environment. This result is useful for designing ""good"" environments where the
defender can act optimally.

  descriptions",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an extensive survey of regular distributions in natural
and social sciences. The survey includes studies from a wide scope of academic
disciplines, in order to create an inventory of the different mathematical
functions used to describe the distributions. The goal of the study was to
determine, whether a unique function can be used to describe all the
distributions (universality) or a particular function is best suited to
describe the distributions in each specific field of research (domain
universality). We propose a classification of distributions into eighth
different categories, based on three representations: the Zipf representation,
the cumulative density function (CDF) and the probability density function
(PDF). In the 89 cases included in the survey, neither universality nor domain
universality was found. In particular, based on the results of the survey, the
claim that ""power law provides a good description for majority of
distributions"" may be rejected. Only one third of the distributions in our
survey are associated with power laws, while another third is well described by
lognormal and similar functions (Dagum, Weibull, loglogistic and Gamma
functions). We suggest that correct characterization of a distribution relies
on two conditions. First, it is important to include the full range of the
available data to avoid distortion due to arbitrary cut off values. Second, it
is advisable to display the data in all three representations: the Zipf
representation, the CDF and the PDF.

landmarks in unconstrained, cluttered environments rather than in the well
segmented face images. We present a novel Backbone-Branches Fully-Convolutional
Neural Network (BB-FCN), which produces facial landmark response maps directly
from raw images without relying on pre-process or sliding window approaches.
BB-FCN contains one backbone and a number of network branches with each
corresponding to one landmark type, and it operates in a progressive manner.
Specifically, the backbone roughly detects the locations of facial landmarks by
taking the whole image as input, and the branches further refine the
localizations based on a local observation from the backbone's intermediate
feature map. Moreover, our backbone-branches architecture does not contain
full-connection layers for location regression, leading to efficient learning
and inference. Our extensive experiments show that our model achieves superior
performances over other state-of-the-arts under both the constrained (i.e. with
face regions) and the ""in the wild"" scenarios.

eigenfunctions, which we call folding\textbackslash{}unfolding. This structure
affects the nodal set of the eigenfunctions, which in turn allows to derive
necessary conditions for Courant-sharpness. In addition, the eigenvalues of
these domains are arranged as a lattice which allows for a comparison between
the nodal count and the spectral position. The Courant-sharpness of most
eigenvalues is ruled out using those methods. In addition, this analysis allows
to estimate the nodal deficiency - the difference between the spectral position
and the nodal count.

Breit-Wigner amplitudes that each describe a resonant state. The significance
of each of these resonances is more than 9 standard deviations. One has a mass

many factors, including security of business process and the underlying system
and technologies. Moreover, humans can be the weakest link that creates pathway
to vulnerabilities, or the worst enemy that compromises a well-defended system.
Since a system is as secure as its weakest link, information security can only
be achieved in PAIS if all factors are secure. In this paper, we address two
research questions: how to conduct a cross-layer security analysis that couple
security concerns at business process layer as well as at the technical layer;
and how to include human factor into the security analysis for the
identification of human-oriented vulnerabilities and threats. We propose a
methodology that supports the tracking of security interdependencies between
functional, technical, and human aspects which contribute to establish a
holistic approach to information security in PAIS. We demonstrate the
applicability with a scenario from the payment card industry.

discrepancies between different first-principles calculations. Here we
investigate the contribution of low-energy phonons with MFP>0.8 um by
accurately measuring the cross-plane thermal conductivity of crystalline
silicon films by time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), over a wide range of
film thickness 1-10 um and temperature 100-300 K. We employ a dual-frequency
TDTR approach to improve the accuracy of our cross-plane thermal conductivity

that phonons with MFP>0.8 um contribute 53 W/m-K (37%) to heat conduction in Si
at 300 K while phonons with MFP>3 um contribute 523 W/m-K (61%) at 100 K, >20%
lower than the first-principles predictions by Lindsay et al. of 68 W/m-K (47%)
and 695 W/m-K (77%), respectively. Using a relaxation times approximation (RTA)
model, we demonstrate that macroscopic damping (e.g., Akhieser's damping)
eliminates the contribution of phonons with mean-free-paths >30 um at 300 K,
which contributes 15 W/m-K (10%) to heat conduction in Si according to Lindsay
et al. Thus we propose that omission of the macroscopic damping for low-energy
phonons in the first-principles calculations could be one of the possible
explanations for the observed discrepancy between our measurements and
calculations by Lindsay et al. Our work provides an important benchmark for
future measurements and calculations of the distribution of phonon
mean-free-paths in crystalline silicon.

of semi-regular red giant variables. Oscillatory convective modes are very
nonadiabatic g$^{-}$ modes and they are present in luminous stars, such as red
giants with $\log L/{\rm L}_\odot \ga 3$. Finite amplitudes for these modes are
confined to the outermost nonadiabatic layers, where the radiative energy flux
is more important than the convective energy flux. The periods of oscillatory
convection modes increase with luminosity, and the growth times are comparable
to the oscillation periods. The LSPs of red giants in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) are observed to lie on a distinct period-luminosity sequence called
sequence D. This sequence D period-luminosity relation is roughly consistent
with the predictions for dipole oscillatory convective modes in AGB models if
we adopt a mixing length of 1.2 pressure scale height ($\alpha = 1.2$).
However, the effective temperature of the red-giant sequence of the LMC is
consistent to models with $\alpha=1.9$, which predict periods too short by a

on-site nonlinearity. Analytic conditions for existence of exact compact
three-site solutions are obtained, and explicitly illustrated for the cases of
power-law (cubic) and saturable nonlinearities. These nonlinear compact modes
appear as continuations of linear compact modes belonging to a flat dispersion
band. While for the linear system a compact mode exists only for one specific
ratio of the two different coupling constants, nonlinearity may lead to
compactification of otherwise non-compact localized modes for a range of
coupling ratios, at some specific power. For saturable lattices, the
compactification power can be tuned by also varying the nonlinear parameter.
Introducing different on-site energies and anisotropic couplings yield further
possibilities for compactness tuning. The properties of strongly localized
modes are investigated numerically for cubic and saturable nonlinearities, and
in particular their stability over large parameter regimes is shown. Since the
linear flat band is isolated, its compact modes may be continued into compact

of the trajectories of the active particles we consider a Gaussian forcing
having a non vanishing correlation time $\tau$, whose finiteness is a measure
of the activity of the system. With these ingredients we show that it is
possible to develop a statistical mechanical approach similar to the one
employed in the study of equilibrium liquids and to obtain the explicit form of
the many-particle distribution function by means of the multidimensional
unified colored noise approximation. Such a distribution plays a role analogous
to the Gibbs distribution in equilibrium statistical mechanics and provides a
complete information about the microscopic state of the system. From here we
develop a method to determine the one and two-particle distribution functions
in the spirit of the Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) equations of equilibrium statistical
mechanics. The resulting equations which contain extra-correlations induced by
the activity allow to determine the stationary density profiles in the presence
of external fields, the pair correlations and the pressure of active fluids. In
the low density regime we obtain the effective pair potential $\phi(r)$ acting
between two isolated particles separated by a distance, $r$, showing the
existence an effective attraction between them induced by activity. Based on
these results, in the second half of the paper we propose a mean field theory
as an approach simpler than the BGY hierarchy and use it to derive a van der

that the evolution equation for the latter is the same as for the leading-twist

``genuine'' three-particle states that belong to the continuous spectrum
effectively decouple from $\phi_-(\omega)$ to the leading-order accuracy. In
turn, the scale dependence of the full three-particle DA turns out to be
nontrivial so that the contribution with the lowest anomalous dimension does

Furthermore the relationship between the magnetic field and enhanced acoustic
emission has not yet been comprehensively examined. We have used vector
magnetograms from the \Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on-board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to image the magnetic-field properties in the
halo. We have studied the acoustic morphology of an active region, with a
complex halo and ""glories,"" and we have linked some acoustic properties to the
magnetic-field configuration. In particular, we find that acoustic sources are
significantly enhanced in regions of intermediate field strength with
inclinations no different from the distributions found in the quiet Sun.
Additionally we have identified a transition region between the active region
and the halo, in which the acoustic source power is hindered by inclined fields
of intermediate field strength. Finally, we have compared the results of
acoustic emission maps, calculated from holography, and the commonly used local
acoustic maps, finding that the two types of maps have similar properties with

measurement of flow rate of liquid metals in fast breeder reactors. Due to the
associated complexities in the measuring environment, theoretical evaluation of
their sensitivity is always preferred. In order to consider the 3D nature of
the problem and the general flow patterns, numerical field computational
approach is inevitable. When classical Galerkin's finite element formulation is
employed for the solution, it is known to introduce numerical oscillations at
high flow rates. The magnetic field produced by the flow induced currents
circulate within the fluid and forms the source of this numerical problem. To
overcome this, modified methods like stream-line upwind Petrov-Galerkin schemes
are generally suggested in the allied areas like fluid dynamics, in which a
similar dominance of advective (curl or circulation) component occurs over
diffusion (divergence) component. After a careful analysis of the numerical
instability through a reduced one dimensional problem, an elegant stable
approach is devised. In this scheme, a pole-zero cancellation approach is
adopted. The proposed scheme is shown to be absolutely stable. However, at
lower flow rates numerical results exhibits small oscillation, which can be
controlled by reducing the element size. The source of stability at higher flow
rates, as well as, oscillations at lower flow rates are analysed using
analytical solution of the associated difference equation. Finally the proposed
approach is applied to the original flow meter problem and the solution is
shown to be stable.

refractive index. Throughout the conventional stages of the inflationary and
post-inflationary evolution, the microwave background anisotropies

agent for the secular evolution of galaxies. One immediate consequence is the
accumulation of gas in the centre of galaxies where it can form stars and alter
the chemical and physical properties. We use a sample of nearby face--on disc
galaxies with available SDSS spectra to study whether the properties of the
ionised gas in the central parts (radii <~0.6-2.1 kpc) of barred galaxies are
altered by the presence of a bar, and whether the bar effect is related to bar
and/or parent galaxy properties. The distributions of all parameters analysed
are different for barred and unbarred galaxies, except for the R23 metallicity
tracer and the oxygen abundance (from photoionisation models). The median
values point towards (marginally) larger dust content, star formation rate per
unit area, electron density and ionisation parameter in the centres of barred
galaxies than in the unbarred counterpart. The most remarkable barred/unbarred
difference appears in the [NII]6583/Ha line ratio, which is on average ~25%
larger in barred galaxies, due to a larger N/O in the centres of these
galaxies. We observe an enhancement of the central gas differences in
later-type galaxies or galaxies with less massive bulges. However the bar seems
to have a lower impact on the central gas properties for galaxies with more
massive bulges (M_bulge > 10^10 M_sun) or galaxies with total stellar mass
above ~ 10^10.8 M_sun. In conclusion, we find observational evidence that the
presence of a galactic bar affects the central ionised gas properties of disc
galaxies, where the most striking effect is an enhancement in the N/O abundance
ratio, which can be qualitatively interpreted as due to a different origin or
evolutionary processes for less and more massive bulges, with the gaseous phase
of the former having currently a closer relation with bars.

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES). Sb$_2$Te$_3$ has a DP
located completely above the Fermi energy ($E_F$) with an in-gap DP. The
excited electrons in the upper Dirac cone stay longer than those below the
Dirac point to form an inverted population. This was attributed to a reduced
density of states (DOS) near the DP .

fluctuation of charge of a neutral scalar Majorana fermion. Possible presence

post-processing models are the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and the ensemble

  In the last few years increased interest has emerged in developing
multivariate post-processing models, incorporating dependencies between weather
quantities, such as for example a bivariate distribution for wind vectors or

  In line with a recently proposed approach to model temperature and wind speed
jointly by a bivariate BMA model, this paper introduces a bivariate EMOS model
for these weather quantities based on a truncated normal distribution.
  The bivariate EMOS model is applied to temperature and wind speed forecasts
of the eight-member University of Washington mesoscale ensemble and of the
eleven-member ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian Meteorological Service

Quite interestingly, while multiple scattering is expected to produce long

scatterers can still provide high path length enhancements due to the very long
trajectories sustained by total internal reflection at the slab interfaces. The
path length distributions are then used to calculate the light absorption
efficiency of media with varying absorption coefficients. We find that maximum

sources of fluorine. Nowadays there is not a consensus on the relevance of AGB
stars in its Galactic chemical evolution. The aim of this article is to better
constrain the contribution of these stars with a more accurate estimate of
their fluorine abundances. Using new spectroscopic tools and LTE spectral
synthesis, we redetermine fluorine abundances from several HF lines in the
K-band in a sample of Galactic and extragalactic AGB carbon stars of spectral
types N, J and SC spanning a wide range of metallicities. On average, the new
derived fluorine abundances are systematically lower by 0.33 dex with respect
to previous determinations. This may derive from a combination of the lower
excitation energies of the HF lines and the larger macroturbulence parameters
used here as well as from the new adopted CN line list. Yet, theoretical
nucleosynthesis models in AGB stars agree with the new fluorine determinations
at solar metallicities. At low metallicities, an agreement between theory and
observations can be found by handling in a different way the
radiative/convective interface at the base of the convective envelope. New
fluorine spectroscopic measurements agree with theoretical models at low and at
solar metallicity. Despite this, complementary sources are needed to explain
its observed abundance in the solar neighbourhood.

evaluation of impedance or layered media Green's functions. Given a point
source located in an unbounded half-space or an infinitely extended layer,
Sommerfeld and others showed that Fourier analysis combined with contour
integration provides a systematic and broadly effective approach, leading to
what is generally referred to as the Sommerfeld integral representation. When
either the source or target is at some distance from an infinite boundary, the
number of degrees of freedom needed to resolve the scattering response is very
modest. When both are near an interface, however, the Sommerfeld integral
involves a very large range of integration and its direct application becomes
unwieldy. Historically, three schemes have been employed to overcome this
difficulty: the method of images, contour deformation, and asymptotic methods
of various kinds. None of these methods make use of classical layer potentials
in physical space, despite their advantages in terms of adaptive resolution and
high-order accuracy. The reason for this is simple: layer potentials are
impractical in layered media or half-space geometries since they require the
discretization of an infinite boundary. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
method which combines layer potentials (physical-space) on a finite portion of
the interface together with a Sommerfeld-type (Fourier) correction. We prove
that our method is efficient and rapidly convergent for arbitrarily located
sources and targets, and show that the scheme is particularly effective when
solving scattering problems for objects which are close to the half-space
boundary or even embedded across a layered media interface.

call this $(k,\ell)$-choosability when the palette is of size at most $\ell$
and the lists must be of size at least $k$. They showed that, for any integer
$k\ge 2$, there is an integer $C=C(k,2k-1)$, satisfying $C = O(16^{k}\ln k)$ as
$k\to \infty$, such that, if a graph is $(k,2k-1)$-choosable, then it is
$C$-choosable, and asked if $C$ is required to be exponential in $k$. We
demonstrate it must satisfy $C = \Omega(4^k/\sqrt{k})$.
  For an integer $\ell \ge 2k-1$, if $C(k,\ell)$ is the least integer such that
a graph is $C(k,\ell)$-choosable if it is $(k,\ell)$-choosable, then we more
generally supply a lower bound on $C(k,\ell)$, one that is super-polynomial in
$k$ if $\ell = o(k^2/\ln k)$, by relation to an extremal set theoretic
property. By the use of containers, we also give upper bounds on $C(k,\ell)$
that improve on earlier bounds if $\ell \ge 2.75 k$.

statistical problems with functional data. The obvious general criterion for
variable selection is to choose the `most representative' or `most relevant'
variables. However, it is also clear that a purely relevance-oriented criterion
could lead to select many redundant variables. The mRMR (minimum Redundance
Maximum Relevance) procedure, proposed by Ding and Peng (2005) and Peng et al.
(2005) is an algorithm to systematically perform variable selection, achieving
a reasonable trade-off between relevance and redundancy. In its original form,
this procedure is based on the use of the so-called mutual information
criterion to assess relevance and redundancy. Keeping the focus on functional
data problems, we propose here a modified version of the mRMR method, obtained
by replacing the mutual information by the new association measure (called
distance correlation) suggested by Sz\'ekely et al. (2007). We have also
performed an extensive simulation study, including 1600 functional experiments
(100 functional models $\times$ 4 sample sizes $\times$ 4 classifiers) and
three real-data examples aimed at comparing the different versions of the mRMR
methodology. The results are quite conclusive in favor of the new proposed
alternative.

function. In classical Morse theory, Morse functions can sometimes be locally
altered and simplified by the Morse moves. These moves include the Whitney
trick which removes two oppositely framed flowlines between critical points of
adjacent index and handle cancellation which removes two critical points
connected by a single flowline.
  A framed flow category is a way of encoding flow data such as that which may
arise from the flowlines of a Morse function or of a Floer functional. The
Cohen-Jones-Segal construction associates a stable homotopy type to a framed
flow category whose cohomology is designed to recover the corresponding Morse
or Floer cohomology. We obtain analogues of the Whitney trick and of handle
cancellation for framed flow categories: in this new setting these are moves
that can be performed to simplify a framed flow category without changing the
associated stable homotopy type.
  These moves often enable one to compute by hand the stable homotopy type
associated to a framed flow category. We apply this in the setting of the
Lipshitz-Sarkar stable homotopy type (corresponding to Khovanov cohomology) and
the stable homotopy type of a matched diagram due to the authors (corresponding
to sl_n Khovanov-Rozansky cohomology).

  Successfully defended on the 5th of March 2015",,,,"stat.ME cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of the present dissertation is to address distributed tracking over a
network of heterogeneous and geographically dispersed nodes (or agents) with
sensing, communication and processing capabilities. Tracking is carried out in
the Bayesian framework and its extension to a distributed context is made
possible via an information-theoretic approach to data fusion which exploits
consensus algorithms and the notion of Kullback-Leibler Average (KLA) of the
Probability Density Functions (PDFs) to be fused. The first step toward
distributed tracking considers a single moving object. Consensus takes place in
each agent for spreading information over the network so that each node can
track the object. To achieve such a goal, consensus is carried out on the local
single-object posterior distribution, which is the result of local data
processing, in the Bayesian setting, exploiting the last available measurement
about the object. The next step is in the direction of distributed estimation
of multiple moving objects. In order to model, in a rigorous and elegant way, a
possibly time-varying number of objects present in a given area of interest,
the Random Finite Set (RFS) formulation is adopted since it provides the notion
of probability density for multi-object states that allows to directly extend
existing tools in distributed estimation to multi-object tracking. The last
theoretical step of the present dissertation is toward distributed filtering
with the further requirement of unique object identities. To this end the
labeled RFS framework is adopted as it provides a tractable approach to the
multi-object Bayesian recursion. A generalization of the KLA to the labeled RFS
framework, enables the development of novel consensus multi-object tracking
filters which are fully distributed, scalable and computationally efficient.

mortality and a significant degree of morbidity result from the growth of
secondary tumors in distant organs (metastasis). It is well-known that
malignant tumors induce the formation of a lymphatic and a blood vascular
network around themselves. A similar but far less studied process occurs in
relation to the nervous system and is referred to as \emph{neoneurogenesis}; in
fact, recent studies have demonstrated that tumors initiate their own
innervation. However, the relationship between tumor progression and the
nervous system is still poorly understood. This process is most likely
regulated by a multitude of factors in the tumor-nerve microenvironment and it
is therefore important to study the interactions between the nervous system and
tumor cells through mathematical/computational modelling: this may reveal the
most significant factors of the plethora of interacting elements regulating
neoneurogenesis. The present work is a first attempt to model the
neurobiological aspect of cancer development through a (simple) system of
differential equations. The model confirms the experimental observations that a
tumor is able to promote nerve formation/elongation around itself, and that
high levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and axon guidance molecules (AGMs) are
recorded in the presence of a tumor. Our results also reflect the observation
that high stress levels (represented by higher norepinephrine release by
sympathetic nerves) contribute to tumor development and spread, indicating a
mutually beneficial relationship between tumor cells and neurons. The model
predictions suggest novel therapeutic strategies, aimed at blocking the stress
effects on tumor growth and dissemination.
