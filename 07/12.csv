approximation (ADA) was implemented to develop a parameter-free, nonlocal
kinetic energy functional to be used in the orbital-free density-functional
theory of an inhomogenous, two-dimensional (2D), Fermi gas. In this work, we
provide a detailed comparison of self-consistent calculations within the ADA
with the exact results of the Kohn-Sham density-functional theory, and the
elementary Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. We demonstrate that the ADA for the
2D kinetic energy functional works very well under a wide variety of
confinement potentials, even for relatively small particle numbers. Remarkably,
the TF approximation for the kinetic energy functional, {\em without any
gradient corrections}, also yields good agreement with the exact kinetic energy
for all confining potentials considered, although at the expense of the spatial
and kinetic energy densities exhibiting poor point-wise agreement, particularly
near the TF radius. Our findings illustrate that the ADA kinetic energy
functional yields accurate results for {\em both} the local and global
equilibrium properties of an inhomogeneous 2D Fermi gas, without the need for
any fitting parameters.

combining carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl and epoxide groups at different
locations. The complexity and variety of GO isomers, whose thermodynamic
stability and formation kinetics depend on applied conditions, make
determination of GO structure with atomistic precision challenging. We report
high level theoretical investigation of multiple molecular configurations,
which are anticipated in GO. We conclude that all oxygen containing groups at
the GO surface are thermodynamically permitted, whereas the edge positions are
systematically more favorable than the center and side positions. We discuss a
potentially novel type of chemical bond or bonding reinforcement in GO, which
consists of a covalent bond and a strong electrostatic contribution from a
polarized graphene plane. We observe and analyze significant modifications of
graphene geometry and electronic structure upon oxidation. The reported
thermodynamic data guide experiments aimed at deciphering GO chemical
composition and structure, and form the basis for predicting GO properties
required for nano-technological applications.

Markovian chain diffusion, which plays a role of a precursor. A fast
bifurcation is formed by a singular fusion of unstable and stable equilibrium

resource for quantum computation and communication. It is therefore important
to investigate how large contextuality can be in quantum theory. Linear
contextuality witnesses can be expressed as a sum $S$ of $n$ probabilities, and
the independence number $\alpha$ and the Tsirelson-like number $\vartheta$ of
the corresponding exclusivity graph are, respectively, the maximum of $S$ for
noncontextual theories and for the theory under consideration. A theory allows
for absolute maximal contextuality if it has scenarios in which
$\vartheta/\alpha$ approaches $n$. Here we show that quantum theory allows for
absolute maximal contextuality despite what is suggested by the examination of
the quantum violations of Bell and noncontextuality inequalities considered in
the past. Our proof is not constructive and does not single out explicit
scenarios. Nevertheless, we identify scenarios in which quantum theory allows
for almost absolute maximal contextuality.

network model for reliable and accurate head pose estimation. Instead of using
a mean face shape, or randomly selected shapes for cascaded face alignment
initialisation, we propose two schemes for generating initialisation: the first
one relies on projecting a mean 3D face shape (represented by 3D facial
landmarks) onto 2D image under the estimated head pose; the second one searches
nearest neighbour shapes from the training set according to head pose distance.
By doing so, the initialisation gets closer to the actual shape, which enhances
the possibility of convergence and in turn improves the face alignment
performance. We demonstrate the proposed method on the benchmark 300W dataset
and show very competitive performance in both head pose estimation and face
alignment.

  framework and software for simulations, diagnostics and calibration",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Combining matching and regression for causal inference provides
double-robustness in removing treatment effect estimation bias due to
confounding variables. In most real-world applications, however, treatment and
control populations are not large enough for matching to achieve perfect or
near-perfect balance on all confounding variables and their
nonlinear/interaction functions, leading to trade-offs. [this fact is
independent of regression, so a bit disjointed from first sentence.]
Furthermore, variance is as important of a contributor as bias towards total
error in small samples, and must therefore be factored into the methodological
decisions. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for quantifying
the combined impact of matching and linear regression on bias and variance of
treatment effect estimation. The framework includes expressions for bias and
variance in a misspecified linear regression, theorems regarding impact of
matching on bias and variance, and a constrained bias estimation approach for
quantifying misspecification bias and combining it with variance to arrive at
total error. Methodological decisions can thus be based on minimization of this
total error, given the practitioner's assumption/belief about an intuitive
parameter, which we call `omitted R-squared'. The proposed methodology excludes
the outcome variable from analysis, thereby avoiding overfit creep and making
it suitable for observational study designs. All core functions for bias and
variance calculation, as well as diagnostic tools for bias-variance trade-off
analysis, matching calibration, and power analysis are made available to
researchers and practitioners through an open-source R library, MatchLinReg.

Identifying and exploiting CSI properties can simplify inference. Some

competition. The examples of intransitivity are drawn from different fields,
such as law, biology, game theory, economics and competitive evolutionary
dynamic. This work is intended as a common platform that allows us to discuss
intransitivity in the context of different disciplines. The basic concepts and
terms that are needed for consistent treatment of intransitivity in various
applications are presented and analysed in a unified manner. The analysis
points out conditions that necessitate appearance of intransitivity, such as
multiplicity of preference criteria and imperfect (i.e. approximate)
discrimination of different cases. The present work observes that with
increasing presence and strength of intransitivity, thermodynamics gradually
fades away leaving space for more general kinetic considerations.
Intransitivity in competitive systems is linked to complex phenomena that would
be difficult or impossible to explain on the basis of transitive assumptions.
Human preferences that seem irrational from the perspective of the conventional
utility theory, become perfectly logical in the intransitive and relativistic
framework suggested here. The example of competitive simulations for the
risk/benefit dilemma demonstrates the significance of intransitivity in cyclic
behaviour and abrupt changes in the system. The evolutionary intransitivity
parameter, which is introduced in the Appendix, is a general measure of
intransitivity, which is particularly useful in evolving competitive systems.
Quantum preferences are also considered in the Appendix.

hard, consisten t with AGN emission. First, there is evidence of hard, absorbed
X-ray emission in stacked bins including relatively high z (\(\sim 1.2\)) ETGs
with average high X-ray luminosity (\(L_{X-LMXB}\gtrsim 6\times{10}^{42}\mbox{

absorbed ""hidden"" AGNs in these ETGs, which are not visible in their optical-IR

indication from our C-COSMOS study of X-ray detected ETGs, we find
significantly enhanced X-ray luminoaity in lower stellar mass ETGs

classical iterative thresholding algorithms using the Jacobi updating rule,
GAITA takes advantage of the Gauss-Seidel rule to update the coordinate
coefficients. Under a mild condition, we can justify that the support set and
sign of an arbitrary sequence generated by GAITA will converge within finite
iterations. This convergence property together with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz
property of ($l_q$LS) naturally yields the strong convergence of GAITA under
the same condition as above, which is generally weaker than the condition for
the convergence of the classical iterative thresholding algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GAITA converges to a local minimizer under
certain additional conditions. A set of numerical experiments are provided to
show the effectiveness, particularly, much faster convergence of GAITA as
compared with the classical iterative thresholding algorithms.

optimized nonnegative matrices appropriate for the intended applications. The
method has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks, including
recommender systems (rating matrix of users by items) and document clustering

typically assume the number of latent factors (i.e., dimensionality of the
loading matrices) to be fixed. This assumption makes them inflexible for many
applications. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric NMF framework to
mitigate this issue by using dependent Indian Buffet Processes (dIBP). In a
nutshell, we apply a correlation function for the generation of two stick
weights associated with each pair of columns of loading matrices, while still
maintaining their respective marginal distribution specified by IBP. As a
consequence, the generation of two loading matrices will be column-wise

allowing the two corresponding binary matrix columns to have greater variations
in their non-zero entries. Our experiments on the real-world and synthetic
datasets show that three proposed models perform well on the document
clustering task comparing standard NMF without predefining the dimension for
the factor matrices, and the Bivariate beta distribution-based and Copula-based
models have better flexibility than the GP-based model.

where $u$ is a word over $\{1,2\}$ containing at least one 1. The notion of a
$u$-representable graph is a far-reaching generalization of the notion of a
word-representable graph studied in the literature in a series of papers.
  Jones et al. have shown that any graph is $11\cdots 1$-representable assuming
that the number of 1s is at least three, while the class of 12-rerpesentable
graphs is properly contained in the class of comparability graphs, which, in
turn, is properly contained in the class of word-representable graphs
corresponding to 11-representable graphs. Further studies in this direction
were conducted by Nabawanda, who has shown, in particular, that the class of
112-representable graphs is not included in the class of word-representable
graphs.
  Jones et al. raised a question on classification of $u$-representable graphs
at least for small values of $u$. In this paper we show that if $u$ is of
length at least 3 then any graph is $u$-representable. This rather unexpected
result shows that from existence of representation point of view there are only
two interesting non-equivalent cases in the theory of $u$-representable graphs,
namely, those of $u=11$ and $u=12$.

codimension $\mu(f)$ of the ideal generated by the partial derivatives of a
power series $f$ whose zeros represent locally the hypersurface, is an
important topological invariant of the singularity over the complex numbers,
but its meaning changes dramatically when the base field is arbitrary. It turns
out that if the ground field is of positive characteristic, this number is not
even invariant under contact equivalence of the local equation $f$. In this
paper we study the variation of the Milnor number in the contact class of $f$,
giving necessary and sufficient conditions for its invariance. We also relate,
for an isolated singularity, the finiteness of $\mu(f)$ to the smoothness of
the generic fiber $f=s$. Finally, we prove that the Milnor number coincides
with the conductor of a plane branch when the characteristic does not divide
any of the minimal generators of its semigroup of values, showing in particular
that this is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the invariance of
the Milnor number in the whole equisingularity class of $f$.

knowledge in the source schema needs to be translated to a semantically
heterogeneous target schema. We refer to this task as ""knowledge translation""
(KT). Unlike data translation and transfer learning, KT does not require any
data from the source or target schema. We adopt a probabilistic approach to KT
by representing the knowledge in the source schema, the mapping between the
source and target schemas, and the resulting knowledge in the target schema all
as probability distributions, specially using Markov random fields and Markov
logic networks. Given the source knowledge and mappings, we use standard
learning and inference algorithms for probabilistic graphical models to find an
explicit probability distribution in the target schema that minimizes the
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the implicit distribution. This gives us a
compact probabilistic model that represents knowledge from the source schema as
well as possible, respecting the uncertainty in both the source knowledge and
the mapping. In experiments on both propositional and relational domains, we
find that the knowledge obtained by KT is comparable to other approaches that
require data, demonstrating that knowledge can be reused without data.

also in the industry for understanding dynamics of team formation. While most
of research works studying groups deal at a macro level with evolution of
arbitrary size communities, in this paper we restrict ourselves to studying
evolution of small group (size $\leq20$) which is governed by contrasting
sociological phenomenon. Given a previous history of group collaboration
between a set of actors, we address the problem of predicting likely future
group collaborations. Unfortunately, predicting groups requires choosing from
$n \choose r$ possibilities (where $r$ is group size and $n$ is total number of
actors), which becomes computationally intractable as group size increases.
However, our statistical analysis of a real world dataset has shown that two
processes: an external actor joining an existing group (incremental accretion
(IA)) or collaborating with a subset of actors of an exiting group (subgroup
accretion (SA)), are largely responsible for future group formation. This helps
to drastically reduce the $n\choose r$ possibilities. We therefore, model the
attachment of a group for different actors outside this group. In this paper,
we have built three topology based prediction models to study these phenomena.
The performance of these models is evaluated using extensive experiments over
DBLP dataset. Our prediction results shows that the proposed models are
significantly useful for future group predictions both for IA and SA.

we found excellent agreement between the SMC/LMC Wesenheit P-L slope. The
difference in LMC and SMC Period-Wesenheit relation LMC and SMC zero points was

the cutoff in neutrino energy can be chosen to be between 2 and 6.3 PeV. We
assume that neutrinos (antineutrinos) have a dispersion relation $E^2=p^2 -
(\xi_3/M_{Pl})~p^3$, and find that both $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ decays are
suppressed at neutrino energies of order of few PeV. We find that the $\mu^-$

filament. This model mimics some of the coarse grained features observed in
context of microtubule (MT) based intracellular transport, wherein cellular
cargo loaded and off-loaded at filament ends are transported on multiple

coupled, such that filament switching rates scale inversely as the length of
the filament. We find that the interplay (off)loading processes at the
boundaries and the filament switching process leads to some distinctive
features of the system. These features includes occurrence of variety of phases
in the system with inhomogeneous density profiles including localized density
shocks, density difference across the filaments and bidirectional current flows
in the system. We analyze the system by developing a mean field (MF) theory and
comparing the results obtained from the MF theory with the Monte Carlo (MC)

threshold of detectability, and they can be observed, in principle, in the
acoustic spectra of these stars. Such stars form a set of natural detectors to
search for gravitational waves over a large spectral frequency range, from

ideal setup for this type of gravitational wave search. This is the case for
triple stellar systems formed by a compact binary and an oscillating star.
Continuous monitoring of the oscillation spectra of these stars to a distance

Diophantus of Alexandria was born in the 3rd century (as far as we know), but a
systematic mathematical study of word equations began only in the 20th century.
So, the title of the present article does not seem to be justified at all.
However, a linear Diophantine equation can be viewed as a special case of a
system of word equations over a unary alphabet, and, more importantly, a word
equation can be viewed as a special case of a Diophantine equation. Hence, the
problem WordEquations: ""Is a given word equation solvable?"" is intimately
related to Hilbert's 10th problem on the solvability of Diophantine equations.
This became clear to the Russian school of mathematics at the latest in the mid
1960s, after which a systematic study of that relation began.
  Here, we review some recent developments which led to an amazingly simple
decision procedure for WordEquations, and to the description of the set of all
solutions as an EDT0L language.

the collision of two electron-ion clouds at a speed that exceeds everywhere the
threshold speed for shock formation. A variation of the collision speed along
the initially planar collision boundary, which is comparable to the ion
acoustic speed, yields a curvature of the shock that increases with time. The
spatially varying Mach number of the shocks results in a variation of the
downstream density in the direction along the shock boundary. This variation is
eventually equilibrated by the thermal diffusion of ions. The pair of shocks is
stable for tens of inverse ion plasma frequencies. The angle between the mean
flow velocity vector of the inflowing upstream plasma and the shock's
electrostatic field increases steadily during this time. The disalignment of
both vectors gives rise to a rotational electron flow, which yields the growth
of magnetic field patches that are coherent over tens of electron skin depths.

contains a portion of outliers, non-robustness of SVMs often causes
considerable performance deterioration. Although many approaches for improving
the robustness of SVMs have been studied, two major challenges remain in robust
SVM learning. First, robust learning algorithms are essentially formulated as
non-convex optimization problems. It is thus important to develop a non-convex
optimization method for robust SVM that can find a good local optimal solution.
The second practical issue is how one can tune the hyperparameter that controls
the balance between robustness and efficiency. Unfortunately, due to the
non-convexity, robust SVM solutions with slightly different hyper-parameter
values can be significantly different, which makes model selection highly
unstable. In this paper, we address these two issues simultaneously by
introducing a novel homotopy approach to non-convex robust SVM learning. Our
basic idea is to introduce parametrized formulations of robust SVM which bridge
the standard SVM and fully robust SVM via the parameter that represents the
influence of outliers. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions
of the local optimal solutions of robust SVM, and develop an algorithm that can
trace a path of local optimal solutions when the influence of outliers is
gradually decreased. An advantage of our homotopy approach is that it can be
interpreted as simulated annealing, a common approach for finding a good local
optimal solution in non-convex optimization problems. In addition, our homotopy
method allows stable and efficient model selection based on the path of local
optimal solutions. Empirical performances of the proposed approach are
demonstrated through intensive numerical experiments both on robust
classification and regression problems.

increases with collisionality at low radial wave number $k_{r}$ and decreases
at high $k_{r}$. GAM frequency also decreases with plasma beta. Radial profiles
of GAM frequency for two Tore Supra shots, which were part of a collisionality
scan, are compared with these calculations. Discrepency between experiment and
theory is observed, which seems to be explained by a finite $k_{r}$ for the GAM
when flux surface averaged density $\langle n \rangle$ and temperature $\langle

projective space (CICY) construction of Calabi-Yau manifolds. CICY three-folds
and four-folds have been studied extensively in the physics literature. Their
utility stems from the fact that they can be simply described in terms of a
`configuration matrix', a matrix of integers from which many of the details of
the geometries can be easily extracted. The generalization we present is to
allow negative integers in the configuration matrices which were previously
taken to have positive semi-definite entries. This broadening of the complete
intersection construction leads to a larger class of Calabi-Yau manifolds than
that considered in previous work, which nevertheless enjoys much of the same
degree of calculational control. These new Calabi-Yau manifolds are complete
intersections in (not necessarily Fano) ambient spaces with an effective
anticanonical class. We find examples with topology distinct from any that has
appeared in the literature to date. The new manifolds thus obtained have many
interesting features. For example, they can have smaller Hodge numbers than
ordinary CICYs and lead to many examples with elliptic and K3-fibration
structures relevant to F-theory and string dualities.

led to the suggestion that this sequence of patterns can serve as an early
indicator of desertification in some ecosystems. Since parameter values can
take on a range of plausible values in the vegetation models, it is important
to investigate whether the pattern sequence prediction is robust to variation.
For a particular model, we find that a quantity calculated via
bifurcation-theoretic analysis appears to serve as a proxy for the pattern
sequences that occur in numerical simulations across a range of parameter
values. We find in further analysis that the quantity takes on values
consistent with the standard sequence in an ecologically relevant limit of the
model parameter values. This suggests that the standard sequence is a robust
prediction of the model, and we conclude by proposing a methodology for
assessing the robustness of the standard sequence in other models and
formulations.

$g$ closer to $f$ than $r$ in the max-norm. The fundamental geometric property
of $Z_r(f)$ is that all its zero sets lie outside of $A:=\{x:\,|f(x)|\ge r\}$.
We claim that once the space $A$ is fixed, $Z_r(f)$ is \emph{fully} determined
by an element of a so-called cohomotopy group which---by a recent result---is
computable whenever the dimension of $X$ is at most $2n-3$. More explicitly,
the element is a homotopy class of a map from $A$ or $X/A$ into a sphere.
  By considering all $r>0$ simultaneously, the pointed cohomotopy groups form a
persistence module---a structure leading to the persistence diagrams as in the
case of \emph{persistent homology} or \emph{well groups}. Eventually, we get a
descriptor of persistent robust properties of zero sets that has better
descriptive power (Theorem A) and better computability status (Theorem B) than
the established well diagrams. Moreover, if we endow every point of each zero
set with gradients of the perturbation, the robust description of the zero sets
by elements of cohomotopy groups is in some sense the best possible (Theorem
C).
