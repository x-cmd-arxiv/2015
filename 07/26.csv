A
well-studied problem in such system is the design of linear beamformers for
power minimization with the quality of service (QoS) constraints. The most
representative algorithms for solving this class of problems are the so-called
MMSE-SOCP algorithm [11-12] and the UDD algorithm [9]. The former is based on
alternating optimization of the transmit and receive beamformers, while the
latter is based on the well-known uplink-dowlink duality theory. Despite their
wide applicability, the convergence (to KKT solutions) of both algorithms is
still open in the literature. In this paper, we rigorously establish the
convergence of these algorithms for QoS-constrained power minimization (QCPM)
problem with both single stream and multiple streams per user cases. Key to our
analysis is the development and analysis of a new MMSE-DUAL algorithm, which
connects the MMSE-SOCP and the UDD algorithm. Our numerical experiments show
that 1) all these algorithms can almost always reach points with the same
objective value irrespective of initialization, 2) the MMSE-SOCP/MMSE-DUAL
algorithm works well while the UDD algorithm may fail with an infeasible
initialization.

We further apply the principle of linearized stability and semigroup

stability of stationary solutions as well as sufficient conditions for
instability.
  Abstract. The end results of this analytical development are relatively
simple inequality-criteria which thus allows for the rapid evaluation of the
existence and stability of a non-trivial stationary solution. To our knowledge,
this work is the first to derive precise existence and stability criteria for
such a generalized model. Lastly, we also provide an illustrating application

initially oriented to the right with probability $p\in[0,1]$. This is done
independently, so that the initial configuration of scatterers, which forms the

ultimately \emph{limit} the particle's motion, causing it to have a periodic

increasingly homogenous, the particle's dynamics undergoes a discontinuous

The problem involves selecting the minimum number of sensors such that every

test cover (MTC) problem, which is NP-hard. We consider two approaches to
obtain approximate solutions to this problem. In the first approach, we
transform the MTC problem to a minimum set cover (MSC) problem and use the
greedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity property of the MSC problem to
compute the solution to the MTC problem. In the second approach, we develop a
new \textit{augmented greedy} algorithm for solving the MTC problem. This
approach does not require the transformation of the MTC to MSC. Our augmented
greedy algorithm provides in a significant computational improvement while
guaranteeing the same approximation ratio as the first approach. We propose

finite, universal conductivity. In this paper, we describe the physics of this
conductivity $\sigma_Q$ in quantum critical metals obtained by charge doping a
strongly interacting conformal field theory. We show that it satisfies an
Einstein relation and controls the diffusivity of a conserved charge in the

wetting and dewetting is investigated by varying the solid--fluid dispersive
interaction energy. The temperature is varied between the triple point and the
critical temperature. A correlation is obtained for the contact angle in
dependence of the temperature and the dispersive interaction energy. Size
effects are studied by varying the number of fluid particles at otherwise
constant conditions, using up to 150 000 particles. For particle numbers below
10 000, a decrease of the contact angle is found. This is attributed to a
dependence of the solid-liquid surface tension on the droplet size. A
convergence to a constant contact angle is observed for larger system sizes.
The influence of the wall model is studied by varying the density of the wall.
The effective solid-fluid dispersive interaction energy at a contact angle of
90 degrees is found to be independent of temperature and to decrease linearly
with the solid density. A correlation is developed which describes the contact
angle as a function of the dispersive interaction, the temperature and the
solid density. The density profile of the sessile drop and the surrounding
vapor phase is described by a correlation combining a sigmoidal function and an
oscillation term.

primarily within layers and interlayer electrical conductivities are low. In
addition, strong covalent in-plane intralayer bonding combined with weak van
der Waals interlayer bonding results in weak phonon-mediated thermal coupling
between the layers. We demonstrate here, however, that Coulomb interactions
between electrons in different layers of multilayer epitaxial graphene provide
an important mechanism for interlayer thermal transport even though all

effect is manifested in the relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in ultrafast

literature solve data stream classification tasks in a batch learning setting,
which suffers from poor efficiency and scalability when dealing with big data.
To overcome the limitations, this paper investigates an online learning

data stream classification techniques that are often based on first-order
online learning, we propose a framework of Sparse Online Classification (SOC)
for data stream classification, which includes some state-of-the-art
first-order sparse online learning algorithms as special cases and allows us to
derive a new effective second-order online learning algorithm for data stream
classification. In addition, we also propose a new cost-sensitive sparse online

anomaly detection tasks where class distribution of data could be very
imbalanced. We also analyze the theoretical bounds of the proposed method, and
finally conduct an extensive set of experiments, in which encouraging results
validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in comparison to a family of

data sets extracting unique information about 7500 R&D alliances and 5200
patent portfolios of firms. This data is used to calibrate the model parameters
for network formation and knowledge exchange. We obtain probabilities for
incumbent and newcomer firms to link to other incumbents or newcomers which are
able to reproduce the topology of the empirical R&D network. The position of
firms in a knowledge space is obtained from their patents using two different
classification schemes, IPC in 8 dimensions and ISI-OST-INPI in 35 dimensions.
Our dynamics of knowledge exchange assumes that collaborating firms approach
each other in knowledge space at a rate $\mu$ for an alliance duration $\tau$.
Both parameters are obtained in two different ways, by comparing knowledge
distances from simulations and empirics and by analyzing the collaboration
efficiency $\mathcal{\hat{C}}_{n}$. This is a new measure, that takes also in
account the effort of firms to maintain concurrent alliances, and is evaluated
via extensive computer simulations. We find that R&D alliances have a duration
of around two years and that the subsequent knowledge exchange occurs at a very
low rate. Hence, a firm's position in the knowledge space is rather a
determinant than a consequence of its R&D alliances. From our data-driven
approach we also find model configurations that can be both realistic and
optimized with respect to the collaboration efficiency $\mathcal{\hat{C}}_{n}$.
Effective policies, as suggested by our model, would incentivize shorter R&D
alliances and higher knowledge exchange rates.

based on earlier works by Boalch. We then prove that for semisimple Lie algebra

atomic nucleus in 1911, and the large body of knowledge about the nuclear force
since acquired was derived from studies made on nucleons or nuclei. Although
antinuclei up to antihelium-4 have been discovered and their masses measured,
we have no direct knowledge of the nuclear force between antinucleons. Here, we
study antiproton pair correlations among data taken by the STAR experiment at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and show that the force between two
antiprotons is attractive. In addition, we report two key parameters that
characterize the corresponding strong interaction: namely, the scattering
length (f0) and effective range (d0). As direct information on the interaction
between two antiprotons, one of the simplest systems of antinucleons, our
result provides a fundamental ingredient for understanding the structure of
more complex antinuclei and their properties.

stochastic mortality using extended CreditRisk$^+$ methodology which is very
different from traditional time series methods used for mortality modelling
previously. In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic
risk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,
circulatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors
introduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between
death events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables
based on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing
and, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence
annuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in
health treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available
data for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method
to identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term
forecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion
of deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987
to 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the
future gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.
Neoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due
to mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due
to circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in
deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a
massive impact on social systems as, typically, such patients need long-term
geriatric care.

embedded in a homogeneous isotropic host would feel uniform strains and
stresses when uniform strains or stresses are applied in the far-field. Of
specific importance is the uniformity of Eshelby's tensor S. Following this
paper a vast literature has been generated using and developing Eshelby's
result and ideas, leading to some beautiful mathematics and extremely useful
results in a wide range of application areas. In 1961 Eshelby conjectured that
for anisotropic materials only ellipsoidal inhomogeneities would lead to such
uniform interior fields. Although much progress has been made since then, the
quest to prove this conjecture is still not complete; numerous important
problems remain open. Following a different approach to that considered by
Eshelby, a closely related tensor P=S D^0 arises, where D^0 is the host medium
compliance tensor. The tensor P is associated with Hill and is of course also
uniform when ellipsoidal inhomogeneities are embedded in a homogeneous host
phase. Two of the most fundamental and useful areas of applications of these
tensors are in Newtonian potential problems such as heat conduction,
electrostatics, etc. and in the vector problems of elastostatics.
Micromechanical methods established mainly over the last half-century have
enabled bounds on and predictions of the effective properties of composite
media. In many cases such predictions can be explicitly written down in terms
of the Hill, or equivalently the Eshelby tensor and can be shown to provide
excellent predictions in many cases. Here this classical problem is revisited
and a large number of results for problems that are felt to be of great utility
in a wide range of disciplines are derived or recalled.

conditions on rapidly rotating convection in the plane layer geometry is
investigated for the case of stress-free mechanical boundary conditions. It is
shown that whereas the leading order system satisfies fixed temperature
boundary conditions implicitly, a double boundary layer structure is necessary
to satisfy the fixed heat flux thermal boundary conditions. The boundary layers
consist of a classical Ekman layer adjacent to the solid boundaries that adjust
viscous stresses to zero, and a layer in thermal wind balance just outside the
Ekman layers adjusts the temperature such that the fixed heat flux thermal
boundary conditions are satisfied. The influence of these boundary layers on
the interior geostrophically balanced convection is shown to be asymptotically
weak, however. Upon defining a simple rescaling of the thermal variables, the
leading order reduced system of governing equations are therefore equivalent
for both boundary conditions. These results imply that any horizontal thermal
variation along the boundaries that varies on the scale of the convection has
no leading order influence on the interior convection.

  Regression",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In logistic regression, separation occurs when a linear combination of the
predictors can perfectly classify part or all of the observations in the
sample, and as a result, finite maximum likelihood estimates of the regression
coefficients do not exist. Gelman et al. (2008) recommended independent Cauchy
distributions as default priors for the regression coefficients in logistic
regression, even in the case of separation, and reported posterior modes in
their analyses. As the mean does not exist for the Cauchy prior, a natural
question is whether the posterior means of the regression coefficients exist
under separation. We prove theorems that provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of posterior means under independent Cauchy priors
for the logit link and a general family of link functions, including the probit
link. We also study the existence of posterior means under multivariate Cauchy
priors. For full Bayesian inference, we develop a Gibbs sampler based on
Polya-Gamma data augmentation to sample from the posterior distribution under
independent Student-t priors including Cauchy priors, and provide a companion R
package in the supplement. We demonstrate empirically that even when the
posterior means of the regression coefficients exist under separation, the
magnitude of the posterior samples for Cauchy priors may be unusually large,
and the corresponding Gibbs sampler shows extremely slow mixing. While
alternative algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler in Stan can greatly
improve mixing, in order to resolve the issue of extremely heavy tailed
posteriors for Cauchy priors under separation, one would need to consider
lighter tailed priors such as normal priors or Student-t priors with degrees of
freedom larger than one.

possibly noisy set of linear measurements arises in a number of areas. In order
to derive rigorous recovery results, the measurement map is usually modeled
probabilistically. We derive sufficient conditions on the minimal amount of
measurements ensuring recovery via convex optimization. We establish our
results via certain properties of the null space of the measurement map. In the
setting where the measurements are realized as Frobenius inner products with
independent standard Gaussian random matrices we show that $10 r (n_1 + n_2)$
measurements are enough to uniformly and stably recover an $n_1 \times n_2$
matrix of rank at most $r$. We then significantly generalize this result by
only requiring independent mean-zero, variance one entries with four finite
moments at the cost of replacing $10$ by some universal constant. We also study
the case of recovering Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices from measurement matrices
proportional to rank-one projectors. For $m \geq C r n$ rank-one projective
measurements onto independent standard Gaussian vectors, we show that nuclear
norm minimization uniformly and stably reconstructs Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices
with high probability. Next, we partially de-randomize this by establishing an
analogous statement for projectors onto independent elements of a complex
projective 4-designs at the cost of a slightly higher sampling rate $m \geq C
rn \log n$. Moreover, if the Hermitian matrix to be recovered is known to be
positive semidefinite, then we show that the nuclear norm minimization approach
may be replaced by minimizing the $\ell_2$-norm of the residual subject to the
positive semidefinite constraint. Then no estimate of the noise level is
required a priori. We discuss applications in quantum physics and the phase
retrieval problem.

arbitrary passive linear optics transformation. This was shown in the case of
an ideal scheme whereby the architecture has no sources of error. In any
realistic implementation, however, physical errors are present, which corrupt
the output of the transformation. We investigate the dominant sources of error
in this architecture --- loss and mode-mismatch --- and consider how it affects
the BosonSampling protocol, a key application for passive linear optics. For
our loss analysis we consider two major components that contribute to loss ---
fiber and switches --- and calculate how this affects the success probability
and fidelity of the device. Interestingly, we find that errors due to loss are
not uniform (unique to time-bin encoding), which asymmetrically biases the
implemented unitary. Thus, loss necessarily limits the class of unitaries that
may be implemented, and therefore future implementations must prioritise
minimising loss rates if arbitrary unitaries are to be implemented. Our
formalism for mode-mismatch is generlized to account for various phenomenon
that may cause mode-mismatch, but we focus on two --- errors in fiber-loop
lengths, and time-jitter of the photon source. These results provide a
guideline for how well future experimental implementations might perform in
light of these error mechanisms.

(Ni) and cobalt (Co) was developed based on an artificial neural network (ANN).
The developed ANN correlates the respective concentrations of Co and Ni given
the absorbance profile of a Co-Ni mixture based on the Beer's Law. The virtual
chemical spectrometer was trained using a 3-layer jump connection neural
network model (NNM) with 126 input nodes corresponding to the 126 absorbance
readings from 350 nm to 600 nm, 70 nodes in the hidden layer using a logistic
activation function, and 2 nodes in the output layer with a logistic function.
Test result shows that the NNM has correlation coefficients of 0.9953 and
0.9922 when predicting [Co] and [Ni], respectively. We observed, however, that
the NNM has a duality property and that there exists a real-world practical
application in solving the dual problem: Predict the Co-Ni mixture's absorbance
profile given [Co] and [Ni]. It turns out that the dual problem is much harder
to solve because the intended output has a much bigger cardinality than that of
the input. Thus, we trained the dual ANN, a 3-layer jump connection nets with 2
input nodes corresponding to [Co] and [Ni], 70-logistic-activated nodes in the
hidden layer, and 126 output nodes corresponding to the 126 absorbance readings
from 250 nm to 600 nm. Test result shows that the dual NNM has correlation
coefficients that range from 0.9050 through 0.9980 at 356 nm through 578 nm
with the maximum coefficient observed at 480 nm. This means that the dual ANN
can be used to predict the absorbance profile given the respective Co-Ni
concentrations which can be of importance in creating academic models for a
virtual chemical spectrophotometer.

malfunction/loss of one arbitrary sensor, and (ii) the failure of connection
(either unidirectional or bidirectional communication) between a pair of
agents. First, we show these problems to be NP-hard, which implies that
efficient algorithms to determine a solution are unlikely to exist. Secondly,
we propose an intuitive two step approach: (1) we achieve an arbitrary minimum
sensor placement ensuring structural observability; (2) we develop a sequential
process to find minimum number of additional sensors required for robust
observability. This step can be solved by recasting it as a weighted set
covering problem. Although this is known to be an NP-hard problem, feasible
approximations can be determined in polynomial-time that can be used to obtain
feasible approximations to the robust structural design problems with

imaginary divide between long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and
its physical origin has been heavily debated over the years. Recently, a
distinct very-soft F814W-band excess at $t\sim 13.6$ days after the burst was
identified in a joint-analysis of VLT and HST optical afterglow data of
GRB~060614, which has been interpreted as evidence for an accompanying
Li-Paczynski macronova (also called a kilonova). Under the assumption that the
afterglow data in the time interval of $1.7-3.0$ days after the burst are due
to external forward shock emission, when this assumption is extrapolated to
later times it is found that there is an excess of flux in several multi-band
photometric observations. This component emerges at $\sim$4 days after the
burst, and it may represent the first time that a multi-epoch/band lightcurve
of a macronova has been obtained. The macronova associated with GRB 060614
peaked at $t\lesssim 4$ days after the burst, which is significantly earlier
than that observed for a supernova associated with a long-duration GRB. Due to
the limited data, no strong evidence for a temperature evolution is found. We
derive a conservative estimate of the macronova rate of $\sim
16.3^{+16.3}_{-8.2}~{\rm Gpc^{-3}}{\rm yr^{-1}}$, implying a promising prospect
for detecting the gravitational wave radiation from compact object mergers by
upcoming Advanced LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA detectors (i.e., the rate is ${\cal R}_{\rm

find the species tree, it has been suggested to use subtrees of the gene trees,

find feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of
this penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This
paper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a
penalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach
constrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP
relaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined
weights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF
problem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum
due to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated
on both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing

their augmentation when a only partial topological and functional
characterization of the network is available. By generating large ensembles of
networks in which user-defined entities and relations are added to the original
core, CABeRNET allows to formulate hypotheses on the missing portions of real
networks, as well to investigate their generic properties, in the spirit of
complexity science.
  Results. CABeRNET offers a series of innovative simulation and modeling
functions and tools, including (but not being limited to) the dynamical
characterization of the gene activation patterns ruling cell types and
differentiation fates, and sophisticated robustness assessments, as in the case
of gene knockouts. The integration within the widely used Cytoscape framework
for the visualization and analysis of biological networks, makes CABeRNET a new
essential instrument for both the bioinformatician and the computational
biologist, as well as a computational support for the experimentalist. An
example application concerning the analysis of an augmented T-helper cell GRN
is provided.

quantum pure states by various authors. The behavior of such inequalities under
Lorentz transformation has been a source of debate and controversies in the
past. In this paper, we consider the two most commonly studied three-particle
pure states, that of W and GHZ states which exhibit distinctly different type
of entanglement. We discuss the various types of three-particle inequalities
used in previous studies and point to their corresponding shortcomings and
strengths. Our main result is that if one uses Czachor's relativistic spin
operator and Svetlichny's inequality as the main measure of non-locality and
uses the same angles in the rest frame ($S$) as well as the moving frame
($S^{\prime}$), then maximally violated inequality in $S$ will decrease in the
moving frame, and will eventually lead to lack of non-locality ( i.e.
satisfaction of inequality) in the $v \rightarrow c$ limit. This is shown for
both the GHZ and W states and in two different configurations which are
commonly studied (\textbf{Case $I$} and \textbf{Case $II$}). Our results are in
line with a more familiar case of two particle case. We also show that the
satisfaction of Svetlichny's inequality in the $v\rightarrow c$ limit is
independent of initial particles' velocity. Our study shows that whenever we
use Czachor's relativistic spin operator, results draws a clear picture of
three-particle non-locality making its general properties consistent with
previous studies on two-particle systems regardless of the W state or the GHZ
state is involved.....
