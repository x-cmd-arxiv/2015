  and its fast adaptation limit","21 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A nonlinear kinetic chemotaxis model with internal dynamics incorporating
signal transduction and adaptation is considered. This paper is concerned with:
(i) the global solution for this model, and, (ii) its fast adaptation limit to
Othmer-Dunbar-Alt type model. This limit gives some insight to the molecular
origin of the chemotaxis behaviour.
  First, by using the Schauder fixed point theorem, the global existence of
weak solution is proved based on detailed a priori estimates, under some quite
general assumptions on the model and the initial data. However, the Schauder
fixed point theorem does not provide uniqueness. Therefore, additional analysis
is required to be developed to obtain uniqueness.
  Next, the fast adaptation limit of this model is derived by extracting a weak
convergence subsequence in measure space. For this limit, the first difficulty
is to show the concentration effect on the internal state. When the small
parameter {\epsilon}, the adaptation time scale, goes to zero, we prove that
the solution converges to a Dirac mass in the internal state variable. Another
difficulty is the strong compactness argument on the chemical potential, which
is essential for passing the nonlinear kinetic equation to the weak limit.

large scale convex optimization problem. On the other hand, $\ell_2$ and

require very strong assumptions to guarantee a subspace-preserving affinity,

projecting these onto a two-dimensional plane, such that the number of acquired

are highly compressive, the reconstruction process becomes challenging. We
previously proposed a compressive imaging reconstruction algorithm that is
applied to two-dimensional images based on the approximate message passing
(AMP) framework. AMP is an iterative algorithm that can be used in signal and
image reconstruction by performing denoising at each iteration. We employed an
adaptive Wiener filter as the image denoiser, and called our algorithm
""AMP-Wiener."" In this paper, we extend AMP-Wiener to three-dimensional
hyperspectral image reconstruction, and call it ""AMP-3D-Wiener."" Applying the
AMP framework to the CASSI system is challenging, because the matrix that
models the CASSI system is highly sparse, and such a matrix is not suitable to
AMP and makes it difficult for AMP to converge. Therefore, we modify the
adaptive Wiener filter and employ a technique called damping to solve for the
divergence issue of AMP. Our approach is applied in nature, and the numerical
experiments show that AMP-3D-Wiener outperforms existing widely-used algorithms
such as gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) and two-step
iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TwIST) given a similar amount of runtime.

values in some finite alphabet (e.g. a finite field). However, if we want to
consider for example communication based on analogue signals, we will have to
consider messages that might be functions selected from an infinite function
space. In this paper, we extend linear network coding over finite/discrete
alphabets/message space to the infinite/continuous case. The key to our
approach is to view the space of operators that acts linearly on a space of
signals as a module over a ring.
  It turns out that modules over many rings $R$ leads to unrealistic network
models where communication channels have unlimited capacity. We show that a
natural condition to avoid this is equivalent to the ring $R$ being Dedekind
finite (or Neumann finite) i.e. each element in $R$ has a left inverse if and
only if it has a right inverse. We then consider a strengthened capacity
condition and show that this requirement precisely corresponds to the class of
(faithful) modules over stably finite rings (or weakly finite).
  The introduced framework makes it possible to compare the performance of
digital and analogue techniques. It turns out that within our model, digital
and analogue communication outperforms each other in different situations. More
specifically we construct: 1) A communications network where digital
communication outperforms analogue communication. 2) A communication network
where analogue communication outperforms digital communication.
  The performance of a communication network is in the finite case usually
measured in terms band width (or capacity). We show this notion also remains
valid for finite dimensional matrix rings which make it possible (in principle)
to establish gain of digital versus analogue (analogue versus digital)
communications.

According to solar metallicity evolutionary models, we can exclude companions
of masses larger than 15 MJup (Teff > 400 K), ages of a few Gyr, and located in
~3.6-18 AU orbits with a 3{\sigma} confidence level. This minimum mass is
approximately 5 MJup smaller than any previous imaging survey that explored the

decoder that depends on the statistics of neither the correlated sources nor
the channel, assuming first that they are both memoryless. Exact analysis of
the random-binning/random-coding error exponent of this universal decoder shows
that it is the same as the one achieved by the optimal maximum a-posteriori

decoding, universal channel decoding, and universal source-channel decoding,
are all obtained as special cases of this result. Subsequently, we further
generalize the results in several directions, including: (i) finite-state
sources and finite-state channels, along with a universal decoding metric that
is based on Lempel-Ziv parsing, (ii) arbitrary sources and channels, where the
universal decoding is with respect to a given class of decoding metrics, and
(iii) full (symmetric) Slepian-Wolf coding, where both source streams are
separately fed into random-binning source encoders, followed by random channel
encoders, which are then jointly decoded by a universal decoder.

the previously used phenomenological theory which is only applicable to
ultra-relativistic neutrinos. To this end we do the following. The Hilbert
spaces of particle states are constructed in such a way that the neutrinos are
combined in a multiplet with its components being considered as different
quantum states of a single particle. The same is done for the charged leptons
and the down- and up-type quarks. In the theory based on the Lagrangian of the
fermion sector of the Standard Model modified in accordance with this
construction, the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations arises as a direct
consequence of the general principles of quantum field theory. Using the
example of the pion decay, when the resulting neutrino has to be
ultra-relativistic, it is shown that the neutrino states produced in the decay
process can be described by a superposition of states with different masses and
identical canonical momenta with very high accuracy.

magnetic null-points and quasi-sepratrix layers (QSLs) searching for the origin
of EIS upflows. Magnetic reconnection at the computed null points cannot
explain all of the observed EIS upflow regions. However, EIS upflows and QSLs
are found to evolve in parallel, both temporarily and spatially. Sections of
two sets of QSLs, called outer and inner, are found associated to EIS upflow
streams having different characteristics. The reconnection process in the outer
QSLs is forced by a large-scale photospheric flow pattern which is present in
the AR for several days. We propose a scenario in which upflows are observed
provided a large enough asymmetry in plasma pressure exists between the
pre-reconnection loops and for as long as a photospheric forcing is at work. A
similar mechanism operates in the inner QSLs, in this case, it is forced by the
emergence and evolution of the bipoles between the two main AR polarities. Our
findings provide strong support to the results from previous individual case
studies investigating the role of magnetic reconnection at QSLs as the origin
of the upflowing plasma. Furthermore, we propose that persistent reconnection
along QSLs does not only drive the EIS upflows, but it is also responsible for

scientific applications on parallel architectures. Indeed, balanced
applications do not waste processor cycles on waiting at points of
synchronization and data exchange, maximizing this way the utilization of
processors. In this paper, we challenge the universality of the load-balancing
approach to optimization of the performance of parallel applications. First, we
formulate conditions that should be satisfied by the performance profile of an
application in order for the application to achieve its best performance via
load balancing. Then we use a real-life scientific application, MPDATA, to
demonstrate that its performance profile on a modern parallel architecture,
Intel Xeon Phi, significantly deviates from these conditions. Based on this
observation, we propose a method of performance optimization of scientific
applications through load imbalancing. We also propose an algorithm that finds
the optimal, possibly imbalanced, configuration of a data parallel application
on a set of homogeneous processors. This algorithm uses functional performance
models of the application to find the partitioning that minimizes its
computation time but not necessarily balances the load of the processors. We
show how to apply this algorithm to optimization of MPDATA on Intel Xeon Phi.
Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of this carefully
optimized load-balanced application can be further improved by 15\% using the
proposed load-imbalancing optimization.

of nodes in time-independent networks, and many of them can be expressed as the
leading eigenvector of some matrix. With the increasing availability of network
data that changes in time, it is important to extend such eigenvector-based
centrality measures to time-dependent networks. In this paper, we introduce a
principled generalization of network centrality measures that is valid for any
eigenvector-based centrality. We consider a temporal network with N nodes as a
sequence of T layers that describe the network during different time windows,
and we couple centrality matrices for the layers into a supra-centrality matrix
of size NTxNT whose dominant eigenvector gives the centrality of each node i at
each time t. We refer to this eigenvector and its components as a joint
centrality, as it reflects the importances of both the node i and the time
layer t. We also introduce the concepts of marginal and conditional
centralities, which facilitate the study of centrality trajectories over time.
We find that the strength of coupling between layers is important for
determining multiscale properties of centrality, such as localization phenomena
and the time scale of centrality changes. In the strong-coupling regime, we
derive expressions for time-averaged centralities, which are given by the
zeroth-order terms of a singular perturbation expansion. We also study
first-order terms to obtain first-order-mover scores, which concisely describe
the magnitude of nodes' centrality changes over time. As examples, we apply our
method to three empirical temporal networks: the United States Ph.D. exchange
in mathematics, costarring relationships among top-billed actors during the
Golden Age of Hollywood, and citations of decisions from the United States
Supreme Court.

can remember salient information from past observations. In this paper, we
present a method for learning policies with internal memory for
high-dimensional, continuous systems, such as robotic manipulators. Our
approach consists of augmenting the state and action space of the system with
continuous-valued memory states that the policy can read from and write to.
Learning general-purpose policies with this type of memory representation
directly is difficult, because the policy must automatically figure out the
most salient information to memorize at each time step. We show that, by
decomposing this policy search problem into a trajectory optimization phase and
a supervised learning phase through a method called guided policy search, we
can acquire policies with effective memorization and recall strategies.
Intuitively, the trajectory optimization phase chooses the values of the memory
states that will make it easier for the policy to produce the right action in
future states, while the supervised learning phase encourages the policy to use
memorization actions to produce those memory states. We evaluate our method on
tasks involving continuous control in manipulation and navigation settings, and
show that our method can learn complex policies that successfully complete a

term on the bowties of the kagome lattice, and inquire if they can suppport
chiral spin liquids as ground states. The method used to study these
Hamiltonians is a flux attachment transformation that maps the spins on the
lattice to fermions coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field on the kagome
lattice. This transformation requires us to consistently define a Chern-Simons
term on the kagome lattice. We find that the chirality term leads to a chiral
spin liquid even in the absence of an uniform magnetic field, with an effective
spin Hall conductance of $\sxy = \frac{1}{2}$ in the regime of $XY$ anisotropy.
The Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya term also leads a similar chiral spin liquid but only
when this term is not too strong. An external magnetic field also has the
possibility of giving rise to additional plateaus which also behave like chiral
spin liquids in the $XY$ regime. Finally, we consider the effects of a
ring-exchange term and find that, provided its coupling constant is large
enough, it may trigger a phase transition into a chiral spin liquid by the
spontaneous breaking of time-reversal invariance.

statistics and machine learning. Kernel-based nonparametric statistics have
been used for this task which enjoy fewer assumptions on the distributions than
the parametric approach and can handle high-dimensional data. In this paper we
focus on the scenario when the amount of background data is large, and propose
two related computationally efficient kernel-based statistics for change-point
detection, which are inspired by the recently developed $B$-statistics. A novel
theoretical result of the paper is the characterization of the tail probability
of these statistics using the change-of-measure technique, which focuses on
characterizing the tail of the detection statistics rather than obtaining its
asymptotic distribution under the null distribution. Such approximations are
crucial to control the false alarm rate, which corresponds to the significance
level in offline change-point detection and the average-run-length in online
change-point detection. Our approximations are shown to be highly accurate.
Thus, they provide a convenient way to find detection thresholds for both
offline and online cases without the need to resort to the more expensive
simulations or bootstrapping. We show that our methods perform well on both
synthetic data and real data.

growth model, universes evolve in discrete time by adding new vertices to their
generating $c$-causet. We first describe an inflationary period that is common
to all universes. After this very brief cycle, the model enters a multiverse
period in which the system diverges in various ways forming paths of
$c$-causets. At the beginning of the multiverse period, the structure of a
four-dimensional discrete manifold emerges and quantum mechanics enters the
picture. A natural Hilbert space is defined and a discrete, free Dirac operator
is introduced. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator.
Finally, we propose values for coupling constants that determine multiverse

emergence of the forward shock peak (Type I/ Type II), and the forward shock
dominated cases without/with $\nu_m$ crossing the band (Type III/IV). We
systematically investigate all the Swift GRBs that have optical detection
earlier than 500 s and find 3/63 Type I bursts (4.8%), 12/63 Type II bursts

favored value of the magnetic equipartition parameter in the forward shock

ratio of $\epsilon_B$ ($R_B$) is about 100. The preferred electron
equipartition parameter $\epsilon_e^{r,f}$ value is 0.01, which is smaller than

recovery theory deals with the problem of recovering the unique sparse
representation $x$ such that $b = A x$. It is known that under certain
conditions on $A$, $x$ can be recovered by the Basis Pursuit (BP) and the
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms. In this work, we consider the
more general case where $b$ lies in a low-dimensional subspace spanned by some
columns of $A$, which are possibly linearly dependent. In this case, the
sparsest solution $x$ is generally not unique, and we study the problem that
the representation $x$ identifies the subspace, i.e. the nonzero entries of $x$
correspond to dictionary atoms that are in the subspace. Such a representation
$x$ is called subspace-sparse. We present sufficient conditions for
guaranteeing subspace-sparse recovery, which have clear geometric
interpretations and explain properties of subspace-sparse recovery. We also
show that the sufficient conditions can be satisfied under a randomized model.
Our results are applicable to the traditional sparse recovery problem and we
get conditions for sparse recovery that are less restrictive than the canonical
mutual coherent condition. We also use the results to analyze the sparse

the signal and the filter, BD does not admit a unique solution. In practice,
subspace or sparsity assumptions have shown the ability to reduce the search
space and yield the unique solution. However, existing theoretical analysis on
uniqueness in BD is rather limited. In an earlier paper, we provided the first
algebraic sample complexities for BD that hold for almost all bases or frames.
We showed that for BD of a pair of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$, with subspace
constraints of dimensions $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, a sample complexity of
$n\geq m_1m_2$ is sufficient. This result is suboptimal, since the number of
degrees of freedom is merely $m_1+m_2-1$. We provided analogus results, with
similar suboptimality, for BD with sparsity or mixed subspace and sparsity
constraints. In this paper, taking advantage of the recent progress on the
information-theoretic limits of unique low-rank matrix recovery, we finally
bridge this gap, and derive an optimal sample complexity result for BD with
generic bases or frames. We show that for BD of an arbitrary pair (resp. all
pairs) of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$, with sparsity constraints of sparsity
levels $s_1$ and $s_2$, a sample complexity of $n > s_1+s_2$ (resp. $n >
2(s_1+s_2)$) is sufficient. We also present analogous results for BD with
subspace constraints or mixed constraints, with the subspace dimension
replacing the sparsity level. Last but not least, in all the above scenarios,
if the bases or frames follow a probabilistic distribution specified in the
paper, the recovery is not only unique, but also stable against small
perturbations in the measurements, under the same sample complexities.

sub-carrier allocation, and the renewable allocation in each transmission
period, the transmitter aims to minimize the purchasing cost under a buffer
delay constraint. By theoretical analysis of the formulated stochastic
optimization problem, we find that transmit the scheduled data through the
subcarrier with best condition is optimal and greedy renewable energy is
approximately optimal. Furthermore, based on the theoretical derives and
Lyapunov optimization, an on-line algorithm, which does NOT require future
information, is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the delay and cost
performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the comparisons with the
delay-optimal policy and cost-optimal policy are carried out.

the fractional quantum Hall effect is well described in terms of composite

1)$, both exact diagonalization and the composite fermion theory show that the
ground state is fully spin polarized and supports a robust spin wave mode even
in the limit of vanishing Zeeman coupling. Thus, even though composite fermions
are formed, a mean field description that treats them as weakly interacting
particles breaks down, and the exchange interaction between them is strong
enough to cause a qualitative change in the behavior by inducing full spin
polarization. We also verify that the fully spin polarized composite fermion

the variance and skewness to give a clear interpretation of 21cm power spectrum
and found that skewness is a good indicator of the epoch when X-ray heating
becomes effective. Thus, the non-Gaussian feature of the spatial distribution
of the 21cm signal is expected to be useful to investigate the astrophysical
effects in the CD and EoR. In this paper, in order to investigate such a
non-Gaussian feature in more detail, we focus on the bispectrum of the 21cm
signal. It is expected that the 21cm brightness temperature bispectrum is
produced by non-gaussianity due to the various astrophysical effects such as
Wouthysen-Field (WF) effect, X-ray heating and reionization. We study the
various properties of 21cm bispectrum such as scale dependence, shape
dependence and redshift evolution. And also we study the contribution from each
component of 21cm bispectrum. We find that the contribution from each component
has characteristic scale-dependent feature, and it is expected that we could
obtain more detailed information on the IGM in the CD and EoR by using the 21cm
bispectrum in the future experiments, combined with the power spectrum and
skewness.

databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of
patent technology classes. In such a patent technology map, almost all pairs of
technology classes are connected, whereas most of the connections between them
are extremely weak. This observation suggests the possibility of filtering the
patent network map by removing weak links. However, removing links may reduce
the explanatory power of the network on inventor or organization
diversification. The network links may explain the patent portfolio
diversification paths of inventors and inventing organizations. We measure the
diversification explanatory power of the patent network map, and present a
method to objectively choose an optimal trade-off between explanatory power and
removing weak links. We show that this method can remove a degree of
arbitrariness compared with previous filtering methods based on arbitrary
thresholds, and also identify previous filtering methods that created filters
outside the optimal trade-off. The filtered map aims to aid in network
visualization analyses of the technological diversification of inventors,
organizations and other innovation agents, and potential foresight analysis.
Such applications to a prolific inventor (Leonard Forbes) and company (Google)
are demonstrated.

The chemical composition of planets is an important constraint for
planet formation and subsequent differentiation. While theoretical studies try
to derive the compositions of planets from planet formation models in order to
link the composition and formation process of planets, other studies assume
that the elemental ratios in the formed planet and in the host star are the
same.
  Aims. Using a chemical model combined with a planet formation model, we aim
to link the composition of stars with solar mass and luminosity with the
composition of the hosted planets. For this purpose, we study the three most
important elemental ratios that control the internal structure of a planet:
Fe/Si, Mg/Si, and C/O.
  Methods. A set of 18 different observed stellar compositions was used to
cover a wide range of these elemental ratios. The Gibbs energy minimization
assumption was used to derive the composition of planets, taking stellar
abundances as proxies for nebular abundances, and to generate planets in a
self-consistent planet formation model. We computed the elemental ratios Fe/Si,
Mg/Si and C/O in three types of planets (rocky, icy, and giant planets) formed
in different protoplanetary discs, and compared them to stellar abundances.
  Results. We show that the elemental ratios Mg/Si and Fe/Si in planets are
essentially identical to those in the star. Some deviations are shown for
planets that formed in specific regions of the disc, but the relationship
remains valid within the ranges encompassed in our study. The C/O ratio shows
only a very weak dependence on the stellar value.

dFIN finds frequent itemsets using a set-enumeration tree with a hybrid search

extensive experiments to compare it against with existing leading algorithms on
a variety of real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that
dFIN is significantly faster than these leading algorithms.

objects that were found centuries ago. However, a few dozen of them are faint,
sparsely populated systems that were identified largely during the second half
of the past century. One of the faintest is ESO 37-1 (E 3) and as such it
remains poorly studied, with no spectroscopic observations published so far,
although it was discovered in 1976.
  Aims. We investigate the globular cluster E 3 in an attempt to better
constrain its fundamental parameters. Spectroscopy of stars in the field of E 3
is shown here for the first time.
  Methods. Deep, precise VI CCD photometry of E 3 down to V=26 mag is presented
and analysed. Low-resolution, medium signal-to-noise ratio spectra of nine
candidate members are studied to derive radial velocity and metallicity. Proper
motions from the UCAC4 catalogue are used to explore the kinematics of the
bright members of E 3.
  Results. Isochrone fitting indicates that E 3 is probably very old, with an
age of about 13 Gyr; its distance from the Sun is nearly 10 kpc. It is also
somewhat metal rich with [Fe/H]=-0.7. Regarding its kinematics, our tentative
estimate for the proper motions is (-7.0+/-0.8, 3.5+/-0.3) mas/yr (or a
tangential velocity of 382+/-79 km/s) and for the radial velocity is 45+/-5
km/s, in the solar rest frame.
  Conclusions. E 3 is one of the most intriguing globular clusters in the
Galaxy. Having an old age and being metal rich is clearly a peculiar
combination, only seen in a handful of objects like the far more conspicuous
NGC 104 (47 Tucanae). In addition, its low luminosity and sparse population
make it a unique template for the study of the final evolutionary phases in the
life of a star cluster. Unfortunately, E 3 is among the most elusive and
challenging known globular clusters because field contamination severely
hampers spectroscopic studies.

with the adaptation mechanism is confirmed with theoretical analysis of simple

integrals. This work describes a formulation of the theory involving a set of
differential equations in parameter space, and especially the definition and
study of an associated Lie group G. The group acts on parameter space and
foliates it into G-orbits. The differential equations essentially provide the
gradient of the integral within the orbit in terms of integrals associated with
degenerate diagrams. In this way the computation of a Feynman integral at a
general point in parameter space is reduced to the evaluation of the Feynman
integral at some freely chosen base point on the same orbit, together with a
line integral inside the G-orbit and the degenerate integrals along the path.
This paper restricts to vacuum diagrams and integrals without numerators, but
the method is expected to generalize. The method is demonstrated by application
to the two-loop vacuum diagram. A relation between the reducibility of a
diagram though IBP and the reducibility of the associated electric circuit
though the Y-Delta transform is speculated.

generalization of the zero forcing number of a graph. The $k$-forcing number of
a simple graph $G$, denoted by $F_k(G)$, is the minimum number of vertices that
need to be initially colored so that all vertices eventually become colored
during the discrete dynamical process by the following rule. Starting from an
initial set of colored vertices and stopping when all vertices are colored: if
a colored vertex has at most $k$ non-colored neighbors, then each of its
non-colored neighbors become colored. Particulary, $F_1(G)$ is a widely studied
invariant with close connection to the maximum nullity of a graph, under the
name of the zero forcing number, denoted by $Z(G)$. Among other things, the
authors proved that for a connected graph $G$ of order $n$ with
$\Delta=\Delta(G)\geq 2$, $Z(G)\leq \frac{(\Delta-2)n+2}{\Delta-1}$, and this
inequality is sharp. Moreover, they conjectured that
$Z(G)=\frac{(\Delta-2)n+2}{\Delta-1}$ if and only if $G=C_n$, $G=K_{\Delta+1}$

of networks of topological defects through pulsars is faced with serious
difficulties. Here, we point out that topological defects may trigger pulsar
glitches within traditional scenarios, such as vortex unpinning. If the energy
transfer from a topological defect exceeds the activation energy for a single
pinned vortex, this may lead to an avalanche of unpinning of vortices and
consequently a pulsar glitch, and therefore the source of angular momentum and
energy required for a glitch event is provided by the pulsar itself. Indeed,
the activation energy for such a process can be very small (essentially zero
compared with the observed increase in the pulsar's rotational kinetic energy
at the onset of a glitch). The unpinning of a vortex by a topological defect
may occur through the passage of the defect into the core of the pulsar.

investigated. This is done by introducing a simple one-dimensional chain

These units represent either each of the modules in a modular protein or each
of the intermediate ""unfoldons"" in a protein domain, which can be either folded
or unfolded. The system is pulled by applying a force to the last unit of the
chain, and the units unravel following a preferred sequence. We show that the
unfolding sequence strongly depends on the pulling velocity $v_{p}$. In the
simplest situation, there appears a critical pulling speed $v_{c}$: for pulling
speeds $v_{p}<v_{c}$, the weakest unit unfolds first, whereas for $v_{p}>v_{c}$
it is the pulled unit that unfolds first. By means of a perturbative expansion,
we find quite an accurate expression for this critical velocity.

networks to either spread a message or to stop an epidemic require the full
topological information of the network on which spreading occurs. In practice,
however, collecting all connections between agents in social networks can be
hardly achieved. As a result, such metrics could be difficult to apply to real
social networks. Consequently, a new approach for identifying influential
people without the explicit network information is demanded in order to provide
an efficient immunization or spreading strategy, in a practical sense. In this
study, we seek a possible way for finding influential spreaders by using the
social mechanisms of how social connections are formed in real networks. We
find that a reliable immunization scheme can be achieved by asking people how
they interact with each other. From these surveys we find that the
probabilistic tendency to connect to a hub has the strongest predictive power
for influential spreaders among tested social mechanisms. Our observation also
suggests that people who connect different communities is more likely to be an
influential spreader when a network has a strong modular structure. Our finding
implies that not only the effect of network location but also the behavior of
individuals is important to design optimal immunization or spreading schemes.

system fills the informational void, which arises due to the absence of retinal
input corresponding to the optic disc, with surrounding visual attributes.
Though there are enough evidence to conclude that some kind of neural
computation is involved in filling-in at the blind spot especially in the early
visual cortex, the knowledge of the actual computational mechanism is far from
complete. We have investigated the bar experiments and the associated
filling-in phenomenon in the light of the hierarchical predictive coding
framework, where the blind-spot was represented by the absence of early
feed-forward connection. We recorded the responses of predictive estimator
neurons at the blind-spot region in the V1 area of our three level (LGN-V1-V2)
model network. These responses are in agreement with the results of earlier
physiological studies and using the generative model we also showed that these
response profiles indeed represent the filling-in completion. These demonstrate
that predictive coding framework could account for the filling-in phenomena
observed in several psychophysical and physiological experiments involving bar
stimuli. These results suggest that the filling-in could naturally arise from
the computational principle of hierarchical predictive coding (HPC) of natural
images.

where total momentum is also conserved. We investigate the heat conduction and
energy diffusion of this full lattice ding-a-ling model with three different
nonlinear inter-particle potential forms. For symmetrical potential lattices,
the thermal conductivities diverges with lattice length and their energy
diffusions are superdiffusive signaturing anomalous heat conduction. For
asymmetrical potential lattices, although the thermal conductivity seems to
converge as the length increases, the energy diffusion is definitely deviating
from normal diffusion behavior indicating anomalous heat conduction as well. No
normal heat conduction behavior can be found for the full lattice ding-a-ling
model.

this work. Our theoretical basis is the recently proposed belief theory with
latent beliefs (simply the latent belief theory for short). Firstly, through
examples, we will illustrate that the vanilla latent belief theory can be made
more expressive. We will identify that a latent belief, when it becomes
visible, may remain visible only while the beliefs that triggered it into the
agent's consciousness are in the agent's belief set. In order that such
situations can be also handled, we will enrich the latent belief theory with
belief dependencies among attributive beliefs, recording the information as to
which belief is supported of its existence by which beliefs. We will show that
the enriched latent belief theory does not possess the recovery property. The
closure by logical consequences is maintained in the theory, however. Hence it
serves as a solution to the open problem in the belief set theories.

observed that in perpendicular magnetic fields, hopping resistivity $R$
decreases, which corresponds to negative MR (NMR), while parallel magnetic
field results in positive MR (PMR) at low temperatures. NMR is explained on the
basis of the ""orbital"" model in which perpendicular magnetic field suppresses
the destructive interference of many paths through the intermediate sites in
the total probability of the long-distance tunneling in the VRH regime. At low
fields, a quadratic dependence ($|\Delta R/R|\sim B^2$) of NMR is observed,
while at $B > B^*$, the quadratic dependence is replaced by the linear one. It
was found that all NMR curves for different samples and different temperatures
could be merged into common dependence when plotted as a function of $B/B^*$.
It is shown that $B^*\sim T^{1/2}$ in agreement with predictions of the
""orbital"" model. The obtained values of $B^*$ allowed also to estimate the
localization radius $\xi$ of charge carriers for samples with different degree

spins.

component in many identification and signal processing techniques and plays a

It is well-known that the RCEP can be reformulated as a (truncated)
trigonometric moment problem subject to a rationality condition. In this paper
we consider the more general multidimensional trigonometric moment problem with
a similar rationality constraint. This generalization creates many interesting
new mathematical questions and also provides new insights into the original
one-dimensional problem. A key concept in this approach is the complete smooth
parametrization of all solutions, allowing solutions to be tuned to satisfy
additional design specifications without violating the complexity constraints.
As an illustration of the potential of this approach we apply our results to
multidimensional spectral estimation and image compression. This is just a
first step in this direction, and we expect that more elaborate tuning
strategies will enhance our procedures in the future.

  Dictionary Annealing","10 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a novel dictionary optimization method for high-dimensional
vector quantization employed in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.
Vector quantization methods first seek a series of dictionaries, then
approximate each vector by a sum of elements selected from these dictionaries.
An optimal series of dictionaries should be mutually independent, and each
dictionary should generate a balanced encoding for the target dataset. Existing
methods did not explicitly consider this. To achieve these goals along with
minimizing the quantization error (residue), we propose a novel dictionary
optimization method called \emph{Dictionary Annealing} that alternatively
""heats up"" a single dictionary by generating an intermediate dataset with
residual vectors, ""cools down"" the dictionary by fitting the intermediate
dataset, then extracts the new residual vectors for the next iteration. Better
codes can be learned by DA for the ANN search tasks. DA is easily implemented
on GPU to utilize the latest computing technology, and can easily extended to
an online dictionary learning scheme. We show by experiments that our optimized
dictionaries substantially reduce the overall quantization error. Jointly used
with residual vector quantization, our optimized dictionaries lead to a better
approximate nearest neighbor search performance compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.

filtration of spaces by taking the union of balls of radius $a$ centered on
points in $X$, $X_a = \cup_{x\in X}B(x,a)$. The rank function
${\beta}_k(X):{\{(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2: a\leq b\}} \to \mathbb{R}$ is then
defined by ${\beta}_k(X)(a,b) = rank ( \iota_*:H_k(X_a) \to H_k(X_b))$ where
$\iota_*$ is the induced map on homology from the inclusion map on spaces. We
consider the rank functions as lying in a Hilbert space and show that under
reasonable conditions the rank functions from multiple simulations or
experiments will lie in an affine subspace. This enables us to perform
functional principal component analysis which we apply to experimental data
from colloids at different effective temperatures and of sphere packings with
different volume fractions. We also investigate the potential of rank functions

model Escherichia coli bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast

transduced in cells. Cells in all domains of life dynamically sense their
environment through signal transduction mechanisms, many involving gene
regulation. The glucose sensing mechanism of S. cerevisiae is a model system
for studying gene regulatory signal transduction. It uses the multi-copy

the presence of elevated extracellular glucose concentrations. We fluorescently
labelled Mig1 molecules with green fluorescent protein (GFP) via chromosomal
integration at physiological expression levels in living S. cerevisiae cells,
in addition to the RNA polymerase protein Nrd1 with the fluorescent protein
reporter mCherry. Using CoPro we make quantitative estimates of Mig1 and Nrd1
protein concentrations in the cytoplasm and nucleus compartments on a
cell-by-cell basis under physiological conditions. These estimates indicate a
4-fold shift towards higher values in concentration of diffusive Mig1 in the
nucleus if the external glucose concentration is raised, whereas equivalent
levels in the cytoplasm shift to smaller values with a relative change an order
of magnitude smaller. This compares with Nrd1 which is not involved directly in
glucose sensing, which is almost exclusively localized in the nucleus under

converter and Silicon micros trip detectors and is sensitive in the energy
range 50 MeV - 10 GeV. Among the space instruments devoted to gamma-ray
astrophysics, AGILE uniquely exploits an analog readout system with dedicated
electronics coupled with Silicon detectors. We show the results of Monte Carlo
simulations carried out to reproduce the gamma-ray detection by the GRID, and
we compare them to in-flight data. We use the Crab (pulsar + Nebula) system for
discussion of real data performance, since its E^{-2} energy spectrum is
representative of the majority of gamma-ray sources. For Crab-like spectrum
sources, the GRID angular resolution (FWHM of ~4deg at 100 MeV; ~0.8deg at 1
GeV; ~0.9deg integrating the full energy band from 100 MeV to tens of GeV) is
stable across a large field of view, being characterized by a flat response up
to 30deg off-axis. A comparison of the angular resolution obtained by the two
operational gamma-ray instruments, AGILE-GRID and Fermi-LAT, is interesting in
view of future gamma-ray missions, that are currently under study. The two
instruments exploit different detector configurations affecting the angular
resolution: the former being optimized in the readout and track reconstruction
especially in the low-energy band, the latter in terms of converter thickness
and power consumption. We show that, despite these differences, the angular

  Collecting Global Trends on Twitter",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most significant current challenges in large-scale online social
networks, is to establish a concise and coherent method able to collect and
summarize data. Sampling the content of an Online Social Network (OSN) plays an
important role as a knowledge discovery tool.
  It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that current
sampling methods must cope with a lack of a full sampling frame i.e., there is
an imposed condition determined by a limited data access. In addition, another
key aspect to take into account is the huge amount of data generated by users
of social networking services. This type of conditions make especially
difficult to develop sampling methods to collect truly reliable data.
Therefore, we propose a low computational cost method for sampling emerging
global trends on social networking services such as Twitter.
  The main purpose of this study, is to develop a methodology able to carry out
an efficient collecting process via three random generators: Brownian, Illusion
and Reservoir. These random generators will be combined with a
Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW) in order to improve the sampling
process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by correctly
providing a descriptive statistics of the collected data. In addition, we also
sketch the collecting procedure on real-time carried out on Twitter. Finally,
we conclude with a trend concentration graphical description and a formal

real-world complex networks. In particular, the problem of selecting the k most
central nodes with respect to this measure has been deeply analyzed in the last
decade. However, even for not very large networks, this problem is
computationally intractable in practice: indeed, Abboud et al have recently
shown that its complexity is strictly related to the complexity of the
All-Pairs Shortest Path (in short, APSP) problem, for which no subcubic
""combinatorial"" algorithm is known. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
for selecting the k most closeness central nodes in a graph. In practice, this
algorithm significantly improves over the APSP approach, even though its
worst-case time complexity is the same. For example, the algorithm is able to
compute the top k nodes in few dozens of seconds even when applied to
real-world networks with millions of nodes and edges. We will also
experimentally prove that our algorithm drastically outperforms the most
recently designed algorithm, proposed by Olsen et al. Finally, we apply the new
algorithm to the computation of the most central actors in the IMDB
collaboration network, where two actors are linked if they played together in a
movie.

films have been studied for different contact configurations that allow to
measure the photoresponse and polarization under the presence of large or
negligible imprint field. It is found that in all cases, the direction of the
photocurrent is dictated by the depolarizing field and ultimately by the film
polarization, with a negligible contribution of the imprint electric field.
However, dramatic differences are found in their time-dependent photoresponse.
Whereas in presence of imprint, steady photocurrents are observed under
suitable illumination, transient photocurrents are generated in absence of
imprint. It is argued that this distinct behavior is determined by the
different Schottky barrier height at electrodes which thus offers a simple way
to tune the film photoresponse. These findings could be exploited for
electro-optic read-out and writing of ferroelectric memories.

arises from fluctuations in modulatory factors that alter their gain, such as

these signals can confound or bias the inferences that one derives from spiking

be captured by a modulated Poisson model, whose rate is the product of a
stimulus-driven response function and an unknown modulatory signal. Here, we
extend this model, by incorporating explicit modulatory elements that are known
(specifically, spike-history dependence, as in previous models), and by
constraining the remaining latent modulatory signals to be smooth in time. We
develop inference procedures for fitting the entire model, including
hyperparameters, via evidence optimization, and apply these to simulated data,
and to responses of ferret auditory midbrain and cortical neurons to complex
sounds. We show that integrating out the latent modulators yields better (or
more readily-interpretable) receptive field estimates than a standard Poisson
model. Conversely, integrating out the stimulus dependence yields estimates of
the slowly-varying latent modulators.

stratification using two-and three-dimensional, MHD simulations. We analyze the
dependence of the tube evolution on the field line twist and on the curvature
of the tube axis in different diffusion regimes. To be able to achieve a
comparatively high spatial resolution we use the FLASH code, which has a
built-in Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) capability. Our 3D experiments reach
Reynolds numbers that permit a reasonable comparison of the results with those
of previous 2D simulations. When the experiments are run without AMR, hence
with a comparatively large diffusivity, the amount of longitudinal magnetic
flux retained inside the tube increases with the curvature of the tube axis.
However, when a low-diffusion regime is reached by using the AMR algorithms,
the magnetic twist is able to prevent the splitting of the magnetic loop into
vortex tubes and the loop curvature does not play any significant role. We
detect the generation of vorticity in the main body of the tube of opposite
sign on the opposite sides of the apex. This is a consequence of the
inhomogeneity of the azimuthal component of the field on the flux surfaces. The
lift force associated with this global vorticity makes the flanks of the tube
move away from their initial vertical plane in an antisymmetric fashion. The
trajectories have an oscillatory motion superimposed, due to the shedding of
vortex rolls to the wake, which creates a Von Karman street.

In the case of single phase $d^1$ oxides, we find that the XPS spectra

display at least two, and sometimes three distinct components, which can be
consistently identified as $d^0$, $d^1$, and $d^2$ oxidation states (with
decreasing order in binding energy). Electron doping increases the $d^2$
component but decreases the $d^0$ component, whereas hole doping reverses this
trend; a single $d^1$ peak is never observed, and the $d^0$ peak is always
present even in phase-pure samples. In the case of $n$-doped SrTiO$_3$, the
$d^1$ component appears as a weak shoulder with respect to the main $d^0$ peak.
We argue that these multiple peaks should be understood as being due to the
final-state effect and are intrinsic to the materials. Their presence does not
necessarily imply the existence of spatially localized ions of different
oxidation states nor of separate phases. A simple model is provided to
illustrate this interpretation, and several experiments are discussed
accordingly. The key parameter to determine the relative importance between the

versus instability of large-scale magnetic configurations in differentially
rotating radiative zones. We computed the axisymmetric magnetic field obtained
from the evolution of a dipolar field threading a differentially rotating
shell. A full parameter study including various density profiles and initial
and boundary conditions was performed with a 2D numerical code. We then focused
on the ratio between the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field
and discuss the stability of the configurations dominated by the toroidal
component using local stability criteria and insights from recent 3D numerical
simulations. The numerical results and a simple model show that the ratio
between the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic fields is highest after an
Alfv\'en crossing time of the initial poloidal field. For high density
contrasts, this ratio converges towards an asymptotic value that can thus be
extrapolated to realistic stellar cases. We then consider the stability of the
magnetic configurations to non-axisymmetric perturbations and find that
configurations dominated by the toroidal component are likely to be unstable if
the shear strength is significantly higher than the poloidal Alfv\'en
frequency. An expression for the critical poloidal field below which magnetic
fields are likely to be unstable is found and is compared to the lower bound of

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of sodium atoms using a stroboscopic technique.
Vortices are spontaneously produced via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in a quench
across the BEC transition and then they slowly precess keeping their
orientation perpendicular to the long axis of the trap as expected for
solitonic vortices in a highly anisotropic condensate. Good agreement with
theoretical predictions is found for the precession period as a function of the
orbit amplitude and the number of condensed atoms. In configurations with two
or more vortex lines, we see signatures of vortex-vortex interaction in the
shape and visibility of the orbits. In addition, when more than two vortices
are present, their decay is faster than the thermal decay observed for one or
two vortices. The possible role of vortex reconnection processes is discussed.

of Computer and System Sciences, 1983) with the aim of efficiently maintaining
a forest of vertex-disjoint dynamic rooted trees under cut and link operations.
These operations respectively disconnect a subtree from a tree, and join two
trees by an edge. Additionally, link-cut trees allow to change the root of a
tree and to perform a number of updates and queries on cost values defined on
the arcs of the trees. All these operations are performed in $O(\log\, n)$
amortized or worst-case time, depending on the implementation, where $n$ is the
total size of the forest.
  In this paper, we show that a list of elements implemented using link-cut
trees (we call it a $\log$-list) allows us to obtain a common running time of
$O(\log\, n)$ for the classical operations on lists, but also for some other
essential operations that usually take linear time on lists. Such operations
require to find the minimum/maximum element in a sublist defined by its
endpoints, the position of a given element in the list or the element placed at
a given position in the list; or they require to add a value $a$, or to
multiply by $-1$, all the elements in a sublist.
  Furthermore, we use $\log$-lists to implement several existing algorithms for
sorting permutations by transpositions and/or reversals and/or
block-interchanges, and obtain $O(n\,\log\, n)$ running time for all of them.
In this way, the running time of several algorithms is improved, whereas in
other cases our algorithms perform as well as the best existing
implementations.

  arXiv:1507.01151",,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been used to formulate many
decision-making problems in science and engineering. The objective is to
synthesize the best decision (action selection) policies to maximize expected
rewards (minimize costs) in a given stochastic dynamical environment. In many
practical scenarios (multi-agent systems, telecommunication, queuing, etc.),
the decision-making problem can have state constraints that must be satisfied,
which leads to Constrained MDP (CMDP) problems. In the presence of such state
constraints, the optimal policies can be very hard to characterize. This paper
introduces a new approach for finding non-stationary randomized policies for
finite-horizon CMDPs. An efficient algorithm based on Linear Programming (LP)
and duality theory is proposed, which gives the convex set of feasible policies
and ensures that the expected total reward is above a computable lower-bound.
The resulting decision policy is a randomized policy, which is the projection
of the unconstrained deterministic MDP policy on this convex set. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first result in state constrained MDPs to give an
efficient algorithm for generating finite horizon randomized policies for CMDP
with optimality guarantees. A simulation example of a swarm of autonomous
agents running MDPs is also presented to demonstrate the proposed CMDP solution
algorithm.

probability for orbital angular momentum transfer from vortices with opposite

excitation of surface plasmon vortices. Electron helical dichroism enables
chirality measurement with unprecedented spatial resolution over a broad range

applied in many domains ranging from social media analytics to biology. A
common task in these applications concerns the detection of community
structures. Many existing algorithms for community detection in multiplexes
attempt to detect communities which are shared by all layers. In this article
we propose a community detection algorithm, LART (Locally Adaptive Random
Transitions), for the detection of communities that are shared by either some
or all the layers in the multiplex. The algorithm is based on a random walk on
the multiplex, and the transition probabilities defining the random walk are
allowed to depend on the local topological similarity between layers at any
given node so as to facilitate the exploration of communities across layers.
Based on this random walk, a node dissimilarity measure is derived and nodes
are clustered based on this distance in a hierarchical fashion. We present
experimental results using networks simulated under various scenarios to
showcase the performance of LART in comparison to related community detection
algorithms.

linear by feature transformation have been recently presented in the
literature. These notably include sparse coding methods and deep neural
networks. However, many of these approaches require the repeated application of
a learning process upon the presentation of unseen data input vectors, or else
involve the use of large numbers of parameters and hyper-parameters, which must
be chosen through cross-validation, thus increasing running time dramatically.
In this paper, we propose and experimentally investigate a new approach for the
purpose of overcoming limitations of both kinds. The proposed approach makes
use of a linear auto-associative network (called SCNN) with just one hidden
layer. The combination of this architecture with a specific error function to
be minimized enables one to learn a linear encoder computing a sparse code
which turns out to be as similar as possible to the sparse coding that one
obtains by re-training the neural network. Importantly, the linearity of SCNN
and the choice of the error function allow one to achieve reduced running time
in the learning phase. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the basis of
two standard machine learning tasks. Its performances are compared with those
of recently proposed non-linear auto-associative neural networks. The overall
results suggest that linear encoders can be profitably used to obtain sparse
data representations in the context of machine learning problems, provided that
an appropriate error function is used during the learning phase.

as most famous members isospectral bounded $\mathbb{R}$-planar domains which
makes one ""not hear the shape of a drum"" [13] - arise from the (group
theoretical) Gassman-Sunada method. Moreover, all the known $\mathbb{R}$-planar
examples (so counter examples to Kac's question) are constructed through a
famous specialization of this method, called transplantation. We first describe
a number of very general classes of length equivalent manifolds, with as
particular cases isospectral manifolds, in each of the constructions starting
from a given example that arises itself from the Gassman-Sunada method. The
constructions include the examples arising from the transplantation technique
(and thus in particular the planar examples). To that end, we introduce four
properties - called FF, MAX, PAIR and INV - inspired by natural physical
properties (which rule out trivial constructions), that are satisfied for each
of the known planar examples. Vice versa, we show that length equivalent
manifolds with FF, MAX, PAIR and INV which arise from the Gassman-Sunada
method, must fall under one of our prior constructions, thus describing a
precise classification of these objects. Due to the nature of our constructions
and properties, a deep connection with finite simple groups occurs which seems,
perhaps, rather surprising in the context of this paper. On the other hand, our
properties define physically irreducible pairs of length equivalent manifolds -
""atoms"" of general pairs of length equivalent manifolds, in that such a general
pair of manifolds is patched up out of irreducible pairs - and that is
precisely what simple groups are for general groups.

of the [Co III] 5892 A emission complex during the nebular phase for SNe Ia
with multiple nebular spectra and show that the line flux follows the square of
the mass of $^{56}$Co as a function of time. This result indicates both
efficient local energy deposition from positrons produced in $^{56}$Co decay,
and long-term stability of the ionization state of the nebula. We compile 77
nebular spectra of 25 SN Ia from the literature and present 17 new nebular
spectra of 7 SNe Ia, including SN2014J. From these we measure the flux in the
[Co III] 5892 A line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer the
initial mass of $^{56}$Ni ($M_{Ni}$) produced in the explosion. We then examine
$^{56}$Ni yields for different SN Ia ejected masses ($M_{ej}$ - calculated
using the relation between light curve width and ejected mass) and find the
$^{56}$Ni masses of SNe Ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (low
stretch s~0.7-0.9), $M_{Ni}$ is clustered near $M_{Ni}$ ~ 0.4$M_\odot$ and
shows a shallow increase as $M_{ej}$ increases from ~1-1.4$M_\odot$; at high
stretch, $M_{ej}$ clusters at the Chandrasekhar mass (1.4$M_\odot$) while
$M_{Ni}$ spans a broad range from 0.6-1.2$M_\odot$. This could constitute
evidence for two distinct SN Ia explosion mechanisms.
