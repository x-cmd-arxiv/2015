guarantees. The most prevalent type of parameters used in kernelization is the
solution size for optimization problems; however, also structural parameters
have been successfully used to obtain polynomial kernels for a wide range of
problems. Many of these parameters can be defined as the size of a smallest
modulator of the given graph into a fixed graph class (i.e., a set of vertices
whose deletion puts the graph into the graph class). Such parameters admit the
construction of polynomial kernels even when the solution size is large or not
applicable. This work follows up on the research on meta-kernelization
frameworks in terms of structural parameters.
  We develop a class of parameters which are based on a more general view on
modulators: instead of size, the parameters employ a combination of rank-width
and split decompositions to measure structure inside the modulator. This allows
us to lift kernelization results from modulator-size to more general
parameters, hence providing smaller kernels. We show (i) how such large but
well-structured modulators can be efficiently approximated, (ii) how they can
be used to obtain polynomial kernels for any graph problem expressible in
Monadic Second Order logic, and (iii) how they allow the extension of previous
results in the area of structural meta-kernelization.

Galerkin finite element method (SGFEM) for approximating the solution of
parameterized elliptic partial differential equations with both affine and
non-affine random coefficients. To compute the fully discrete solution, such
approaches employ a Galerkin projection in both the deterministic and
stochastic domains, produced here by a combination of finite elements and a
global orthogonal basis, defined on an isotopic total degree index set,
respectively. To account for the sparsity of the resulting system, we present a
rigorous cost analysis that considers the total number of coupled finite
element systems that must be simultaneously solved in the SGFEM. However, to
maintain sparsity as the coefficient becomes increasingly nonlinear in the
parameterization, it is necessary to also approximate the coefficient by an
additional orthogonal expansion. In this case we prove a rigorous complexity
estimate for the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) required per
matrix-vector multiplication of the coupled system. Based on such complexity
estimates we also develop explicit cost bounds in terms of FLOPs to solve the
stochastic Galerkin (SG) systems to a prescribed tolerance, which are used to
compare with the minimal complexity estimates of a stochastic collocation
finite element method (SCFEM), shown in our previous work [16]. Finally,
computational evidence complements the theoretical estimates and supports our
conclusion that, in the case that the coefficient is affine, the coupled SG
system can be solved more efficiently than the decoupled SC systems. However,
as the coefficient becomes more nonlinear, it becomes prohibitively expensive
to obtain an approximation with the SGFEM.

bioacoustics properties as inputs for the respective automatic identification

vocalizations of these animals were collected and processed using several known
signal processing techniques to convert the respective sounds into computable
bioacoustics values. The converted values of the vocalizations, together with
the breed or species identifications, were used to train the ANNs following a
ten-fold cross validation technique. Tests show that the respective ANNs can
correctly identify 71.43\% of the birds, 94.44\% of the dogs, and 90.91\% of

automatically determine animal breeds and species, which together could be a
promising automated tool for animal identification, biodiversity determination,

galaxies into five photometric redshift bins, finding significant ($>$$2

find the redshift evolution of the signal matches expectations, although the
amplitude is consistently lower than predicted across redshift bins. We test

photometric redshift calibration uncertainties. The current state-of-the-art
cosmic shear measurements from CFHTLenS are mildly discrepant with the
cosmological constraints from Planck CMB data; our results are consistent with
both datasets. Our uncertainties are $\sim$30\% larger than those from CFHTLenS
when we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attribute
largely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. We investigate
constraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the full

strongly interacting systems, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods provide some of
the most accurate solutions, but they require as input local potentials. We
have recently constructed local chiral nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions up to
next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). Chiral EFT naturally predicts
consistent many-body forces. In this paper, we consider the leading chiral
three-nucleon (3N) interactions in local form. These are included in auxiliary
field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) simulations. We present results for the
equation of state of neutron matter and for the energies and radii of neutron
drops. In particular, we study the regulator dependence at the Hartree-Fock
level and in AFDMC and find that present local regulators lead to less
repulsion from 3N forces compared to the usual nonlocal regulators.

observed in-plane thermal contraction can be attributed partially to the ripple
effect, similarly in graphene. The ripple effect itself, however, is not
sufficient to explain anomalously larger thermal contraction found in graphyne
than in graphene. Our deliberate analysis on the phonon modes observed in
graphyne enables us to discover another source causing such thermal expansion
anomaly. We find that there are particular phonon modes with frequencies around
a few hundreds of cm$^{-1}$ existing exclusively in graphyne that may fill
empty spaces resulting in area reduction. These modes are identified as ""rigid

AGN, where an infinitesimal point source is located on the black hole spin
axis. This is especially invoked for Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies,
where an extremely broad iron line seen in episodes of low X-ray flux can both
be explained by extremely strong relativistic effects as the source approaches
the black hole horizon. The most extreme spectrum seen from the NLS1 1H0707-495
requires that the source is less than 1Rg above the event horizon in this
geometry. However, the source must also be large enough to intercept sufficient
seed photons from the disk to make the hard X-ray Compton continuum which
produces the observed iron line/reflected spectrum. We use a fully relativistic
ray tracing code to show that this implies that the source must be
substantially larger than 1Rg in 1H0707-495 if the disk is the source of seed
photons. Hence the source cannot fit as close as 1Rg to the horizon, so the
observed spectrum and variability are not formed purely by effects of strong
gravity but probably also by changes in corona and inner accretion flow
geometry.

found that a proper solution for the cosmic expansion rate can be lost in some

strongest constraint on the $f(G)$ gravity. We then derive constraints on

electromagnetic simulations present non-physical modifications of Maxwell's

Matched Layers (PMLs) are used at simulation domain boundaries to simulate open
media. Another example is the use of arbitrary order Maxwell solver with domain
decomposition technique that may under some condition involve stencil
truncations at subdomain boundaries, resulting in small spurious errors that do
eventually build up. In each case, a careful evaluation of the characteristics
and magnitude of the errors resulting from these approximations, and their
impact at any frequency and angle, requires detailed analytical and numerical
studies. To this end, we present a general analytical approach that enables the
evaluation of numerical discretization errors of fully three-dimensional

of the local stencil in the simulation domain. The analytical model is
validated against simulations of domain decomposition technique and PMLs, when
these are used with very high-order Maxwell solver, as well as in the infinite

approach enables exact predictions in each case. It also confirms that the
domain decomposition technique can be used with very high-order Maxwell solver

within the same pair. We study whether this $2+2$ fermionic system can exhibit
(as the $3+1$ fermionic system) a four-body Efimov effect in the absence of
three-body Efimov effect, that is the mass ratio $\alpha$ between $\uparrow$
and $\downarrow$ fermions and its inverse are both smaller than
13.6069{\ldots}. For this purpose, we investigate scale invariant zero-energy
solutions of the four-body Schr\""odinger equation, that is positively
homogeneous functions of the coordinates of degree {$s-7/2$}, where $s$ is a
generalized Efimov exponent {that becomes purely imaginary in the presence of a
four-body Efimov effect.} Using rotational invariance in momentum space, it is
found that the allowed values of $s$ are such that $M(s)$ has a zero
eigenvalue; here the operator $M(s)$, that depends on the total angular
momentum $\ell$, acts on functions of two real variables (the cosine of the
angle between two wave vectors and the logarithm of the ratio of their moduli),
and we write it explicitly in terms of an integral matrix kernel. We have
performed a spectral analysis of $M(s)$, analytical and for an arbitrary
imaginary $s$ for the continuous spectrum, numerical and limited to $s = 0$ and
$\ell \le 12$ for the discrete spectrum. We conclude that no eigenvalue of
$M(0)$ crosses zero over the mass ratio interval $\alpha \in [1,
13.6069\ldots]$, even if, in the parity sector $(-1)^{\ell}$, the continuous
spectrum of $M(s)$ has everywhere a zero lower border. As a consequence, there
is no possibility of a four-body Efimov effect for the 2+2 fermions. We also
enunciated a conjecture for the fourth virial coefficient of the unitary
spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas,inspired from the known analytical form of the third
cluster coefficient and involving the integral over the imaginary $s$-axis of
$s$ times the logarithmic derivative of the determinant of $M(s)$ summed over
all angular momenta.The conjectured value is in contradiction with the
experimental results.

Boltzmann equations for the particle species involved in their generation,
including all the relevant processes. In the most simple, but still general,
limit, in which the processes determining the abundance and the decay rate of
the Bino are mediated by degenerate right-handed squarks, the correct values of
the DM and baryon relic densities are achieved for a Bino mass between 50 and

physical systems that meet the stringent requirements for creating and
preserving quantum entanglement. In atomic physics, robust two-qubit
entanglement is typically achieved by strong, long-range interactions in the
form of Coulomb interactions between ions or dipolar interactions between
Rydberg atoms. While these interactions allow fast gates, atoms subject to
these interactions must overcome the associated coupling to the environment and
cross-talk among qubits. Local interactions, such as those requiring
significant wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental effects yet
present a new challenge: To distribute entanglement, qubits must be
transported, merged for interaction, and then isolated for storage and
subsequent operations. Here we show how, via a mobile optical tweezer, it is
possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms, and then
separate them while preserving their entanglement. While ground-state neutral
atom experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin entanglement, and
detected entanglement with macroscopic observables, we are now able to
demonstrate position-resolved two-particle coherence via application of a local
gradient and parity measurements; this new entanglement-verification protocol
could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially-separated
atoms. The local entangling operation is achieved via ultracold spin-exchange
interactions, and quantum tunneling is used to combine and separate atoms. Our
toolset provides a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local
operations within a large-scale quantum register.

$\Delta\Phi=0,\pi$ (which uniquely label the source), the inclination
$\theta_{JN}$ of the binary's total angular momentum with respect to the line
of sight (which determines the strength of precessional effects in the

distinguished for a wide range of binaries, except for highly symmetric
configurations where precessional effects are suppressed. Motivated by new
insight into double-spin evolution, we introduce new variables to characterize
precessing black hole binaries which naturally reflects the timescale
separation of the system and therefore better encode the dynamical information

the catalog best-fit models in various energy ranges, which cover the curvature
around the spectral peak or break, resulting in a total of 1,113 spectra being
analysed. We compute the sharpness angles under the peak or break of the
triangle constructed under the model fit curves and compare to the values
obtained from various representative emission models: blackbody,
single-electron synchrotron, synchrotron emission from a Maxwellian or
power-law electron distribution. We find that 35% of the time-resolved spectra
are inconsistent with the single-electron synchrotron function, and 91% are
inconsistent with the Maxwellian synchrotron function. The single temperature,
single emission time and location blackbody function is found to be sharper
than all the spectra. No general evolutionary trend of the sharpness angle is
observed, neither per burst nor for the whole population. It is found that the
limiting case, a single temperature Maxwellian synchrotron function, can only
contribute up to $58^{+23}_{-18}$% of the peak flux. Our results show that even
the sharpest but non-realistic case, the single-electron synchrotron function,
cannot explain a large fraction of the observed GRB prompt spectra. Because of
the fact that any combination of physically possible synchrotron spectra added

considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical
quantum computation, that under two feasible conjectures, cannot even be
approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance,
unless the PH collapses.
  In this work we use Quantum Fourier Sampling to construct a class of
distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer. We then argue that
these distributions cannot be approximately sampled classically, unless the PH
collapses, under variants of the Aaronson and Arkhipov conjectures.
  In particular, we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions
each of which is based on an ""Efficiently Specifiable"" polynomial, for which a
classical approximate sampler implies an average-case approximation. This class
of polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the
Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar #P-hard polynomials.
  Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov,
likely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this

that our results are robust to the choice of shear measurement pipeline, either
ngmix or im3shape, and robust to the choice of two-point statistic, including
both real and Fourier-space statistics. Our results pass a suite of null tests
including tests for B-mode contamination and direct tests for any dependence of
the two-point functions on a set of 16 observing conditions and galaxy
properties, such as seeing, airmass, galaxy color, galaxy magnitude, etc. We
furthermore use a large suite of simulations to compute the covariance matrix
of the cosmic shear measurements and assign statistical significance to our
null tests. We find that our covariance matrix is consistent with the halo
model prediction, indicating that it has the appropriate level of halo sample
variance. We compare the same jackknife procedure applied to the data and the
simulations in order to search for additional sources of noise not captured by
the simulations. We find no statistically significant extra sources of noise in
the data. The overall detection significance with tomography for our highest

to the theorem being proved cannot contain certain configurations, and then
showing that each graph under consideration contains at least one such
configuration; these configurations are called \emph{reducible} for that
theorem. (A \emph{configuration} is a subgraph $H$, along with specified
degrees $d_G(v)$ in the original graph $G$ for each vertex of $H$.)
  We give a general framework for showing that configurations are reducible for
edge-coloring. A particular form of reducibility, called \emph{fixability}, can
be considered without reference to a containing graph. This has two key
benefits: (i) we can now formulate necessary conditions for fixability, and
(ii) the problem of fixability is easy for a computer to solve. The necessary
condition of \emph{superabundance} is sufficient for multistars and we
conjecture that it is sufficient for trees as well, which would generalize the
powerful technique of Tashkinov trees.
  Via computer, we can generate thousands of reducible configurations, but we
have short proofs for only a small fraction of these. The computer can write
\LaTeX\ code for its proofs, but they are only marginally enlightening and can
run thousands of pages long. We give examples of how to use some of these
reducible configurations to prove conjectures on edge-coloring for small
maximum degree. Our aims in writing this paper are (i) to provide a common
context for a variety of reducible configurations for edge-coloring and (ii) to
spur development of methods for humans to understand what the computer already

underground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determination
of the neutrino mass hierarchy as a primary physics goal. It is also capable of
observing neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, including
supernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos,
atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such as
nucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physics
motivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various
proposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants
at 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4
sigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino
spectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six
oscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\%. Neutrino burst from a
typical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000
inverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic
scattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information
on the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino
energy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400
events per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino
samples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton
decay via the $p\to K^++\bar\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide
a unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and
astrophysics. It holds the great potential for further advancing our quest to
understanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, one of the building
blocks of our Universe.

its environment interspersed with voids where life is very uncommon. In a
favorable scenario, detection of as few as $\sim 25$ biologically active

distortion contamination from the hot gas in the low redshift Universe and we
can thus only place upper limits on the $\mu$-type distortion fluctuations. For
the amplitude of $\mu$-type distortions on $10'$ scales we get the limit on
root mean square (rms) value $\mu_{rms}^{10'}< 6.4\times 10^{-6}$, a limit 14
times stronger than the COBE-FIRAS ($95\%$ confidence) limit on the mean of $<
\mu > <90\times 10^{-6}$. Using our maps we also place strong upper limits on
the auto angular power spectrum of $\mu$, $C_{\ell}^{\mu\mu}$ and the cross
angular power spectrum of $\mu$ with the CMB temperature anisotropies,
$C_{\ell}^{\mu T}$. The strongest observational limits are on the largest
scales, $\ell(\ell+1)/(2\pi)C_{\ell}^{\mu\mu}|_{\ell=2-26}<(2.3\pm 1.0)\times

physics which can create spatially varying energy release in the early Universe

specifically apply our observational results to constrain the primordial
non-Gaussianity of the local type, when the source of $\mu$-distortion is Silk
damping, for very squeezed configurations with the wavenumber for the short
wavelength mode $46 \lesssim k_{S} \lesssim 10^4 ~{Mpc^{-1}}$ and for the long
wavelength mode $k_{L}\approx 10^{-3} ~{Mpc^{-1}}$. Our limits on the
primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are $f_{NL}<10^5, \tau_{NL}<1.4\times

of the evolution of the $\mu$-distortion fluctuations. We also introduce mixing
of Bose-Einstein spectra and $y^{BE}$-type distortions.

this work is to understand the differences observed between the twelve
participating numerical codes against the various analytical expressions
examining the D-type phase of HII region expansion. To do this, we propose two
well-defined tests which are tackled by 1D and 3D grid- and SPH- based codes.
The first test examines the `early phase' D-type scenario during which the
mechanical pressure driving the expansion is significantly larger than the
thermal pressure of the neutral medium. The second test examines the `late
phase' D-type scenario during which the system relaxes to pressure equilibrium
with the external medium. Although they are mutually in excellent agreement,
all twelve participating codes follow a modified expansion law that deviates
significantly from the classical Spitzer solution in both scenarios. We present
a semi-empirical formula combining the two different solutions appropriate to
both early and late phases that agrees with high-resolution simulations to
$\lesssim2\%$. This formula provides a much better benchmark solution for code
validation than the Spitzer solution. The present comparison has validated the

column densities for the outflows are $\sim$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outflow
velocity (v$_{out}$) correlates only weakly with the galaxy stellar mass
(M$_*$), or circular velocity (v$_{cir}$), but strongly with both SFR and
SFR/area. The normalized outflow velocity (v$_{out}/v_{cir}$) correlates well
with both SFR/area and SFR/M$_*$. The estimated outflow rates of warm ionized
gas ($\dot{M}$) are $\sim$ 1 to 4 times the SFR, and the ratio $\dot{M}/SFR$
does not correlate with v$_{out}$.
  We show that a model of a population of clouds accelerated by the combined
forces of gravity and the momentum flux from the starburst matches the data. We
find a threshold value for the ratio of the momentum flux supplied by the
starburst to the critical momentum flux needed for the wind to overcome gravity
acting on the clouds ($R_{crit}$). For $R_{crit} >$ 10 (strong-outflows) the
outflow momentum flux is similar to the total momentum flux from the starburst
and the outflow velocity exceeds the galaxy escape velocity. Neither is the
case for the weak-outflows ($R_{crit} <$ 10). For the weak-outflows, the data
severely disagree with many prescriptions in numerical simulations or
semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution. The agreement is better for the
strong-outflows, and we advocate the use of $R_{crit}$ to guide future
prescriptions.

if this can cause departures from universality. In order to explore this
dependance, we use a set of different N-body cosmological simulations (Le
SBARBINE simulations), with the latest cosmological parameters from the Planck

the other overdensities we considered. We provide fitting functions for the
halo mass function parameters as a function of overdensity, that allow to
predict, to within a few percent accuracy, the halo mass function for a wide

camera based on Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), a new
technology that has the potential for broad application in astronomy. Using an
array of MKIDs, the instrument is able to produce time-resolved imaging and
low-resolution spectroscopy constructed from detections of individual photons.
The arrival time and energy of each photon are recorded in a manner similar to
X-ray calorimetry, but at higher photon fluxes. The technique works over a very
large wavelength range, is free from fundamental read noise and dark-current
limitations, and provides microsecond-level timing resolution. Since the
instrument reads out all pixels continuously while exposing, there is no loss
of active exposure time to readout. The technology requires a different
approach to data reduction compared to conventional CCDs. We outline here the
prototype data reduction pipeline developed for ARCONS, though many of the
principles are also more broadly applicable to energy-resolved photon counting
arrays (e.g., transition edge sensors, superconducting tunnel junctions). We
describe the pipeline's current status, and the algorithms and techniques
employed in taking data from the arrival of photons at the MKID array to the
production of images, spectra, and time-resolved light curves.

clusters is highly controversial, as complementary observational methods often
deliver significantly different results. In order to understand these
discrepancies, we develop a procedure to simulate integral field unit (IFU)
observations of globular clusters: Simulating IFU Star Cluster Observations
(SISCO). The input of our software are realistic dynamical models of globular
clusters that are then converted in a spectral data cube. We apply SISCO to
Monte Carlo cluster simulations from Downing et al. (2010), with a realistic
number of stars and concentrations. Using independent realisations of a given
simulation we are able to quantify the stochasticity intrinsic to the problem
of observing a partially resolved stellar population with integrated-light
spectroscopy. We show that the luminosity-weighted IFU observations can be
strongly biased by the presence of a few bright stars that introduce a scatter
in the velocity dispersion measurements up to $\simeq$40% around the expected
value, preventing any sound assessment of the central kinematic and a sensible
interpretation of the presence/absence of an intermediate mass black hole.
Moreover, we illustrate that, in our mock IFU observations, the average
kinematic tracer has a mass of $\simeq$0.75 solar masses, only slightly lower
than the mass of the typical stars examined in studies of resolved
line-of-sight velocities of giant stars. Finally, in order to recover unbiased
kinematic measurements we test different masking techniques that allow us to
remove the spaxels dominated by bright stars, bringing the scatter down to a
level of only a few percent. The application of SISCO will allow to investigate
state-of-the-art simulations as realistic observations.

massive at birth, up to $10-100\times$, than they are presently. This is
invoked in order to have enough material processed through first generation
stars in order to form the observed numbers of enriched stars (inferred to be
second generation stars in these models). If such mass loss was due to tidal
stripping, gas expulsion, or tidal interaction with the birth environment,
there should be clear correlations between the fraction of enriched stars and
other cluster properties, whereas the observations show a remarkably uniform
enriched fraction of $0.68\pm0.07$ (from 33 observed GCs). If interpreted in
the heavy mass loss paradigm, this means that all GCs lost the same fraction of
their initial mass (between $95-98$\%), regardless of their mass, metallicity,
location at birth or subsequent migration, or epoch of formation. This is
incompatible with predictions, hence we suggest that GCs were not significantly
more massive at birth, and that the fraction of enriched to primordial stars
observed in clusters today likely reflects their initial value. If true, this
would rule out self-enrichment through nucleosynthesis as a viable solution to

yet-to-date and the relatively large volume allow us to place a better
constraint at both the low- and high-mass ends of the GSMFs compared to
previous space-based studies from pre-CANDELS observations. Supplemented by a
stacking analysis, we find a linear correlation between the rest-frame UV
absolute magnitude at 1500 \AA\ ($M_{\rm UV}$) and logarithmic stellar mass
($\log M_*$) that holds for galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 10$. We
use simulations to validate our method of measuring the slope of the $\log
M_*$-$M_{\rm UV}$ relation, finding that the bias is minimized with a hybrid
technique combining photometry of individual bright galaxies with stacked
photometry for faint galaxies. The resultant measured slopes do not
significantly evolve over $z=$ 4-8, while the normalization of the trend
exhibits a weak evolution toward lower masses at higher redshift. We combine
the $\log M_*$-$M_{\rm UV}$ distribution with observed rest-frame UV luminosity

early-stage researchers, firms, visitors) and non-users (the general public).
Four classes of contributions to users are identified: knowledge output, human
capital development, technological spillovers, and cultural effects. Benefits
for non-users can be estimated, in analogy to public goods with no practical
use (such as environment preservation), using willingness to pay. We determine
the probability distribution of cost and benefits for the LHC since 1993 until

benefits exceed its costs, with an expected net present value of about 3
billion euro, not including the unpredictable economic value of discovery of
any new physics. We argue that the evaluation approach proposed here can be
replicated for any large-scale research infrastructure, thus helping the

seeing, airmass, or sky background, are major sources of systematic
uncertainties in modern galaxy survey analyses, in particular in deep
multi-epoch surveys. We present a framework to extract and project these
sources of systematics onto the sky, and apply it to the Dark Energy Survey
(DES) to map the observing conditions of the Science Verification (SV) data.
The resulting distributions and maps of sources of systematics are used in
several analyses of DES SV to perform detailed null tests with the data, and
also to incorporate systematics in survey simulations. We illustrate the
complementarity of these two approaches by comparing the SV data with the
BCC-UFig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the DES
SV images. We analyse the BCC-UFig simulation to construct galaxy samples
mimicking those used in SV galaxy clustering studies. We show that the
spatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities and
the redshift distributions of the SV data are successfully reproduced by the
simulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. The combined
use of the maps, the SV data and the BCC-UFig simulation allows us to quantify
the impact of spatial systematics on $N(z)$, the redshift distributions
inferred using photometric redshifts. We conclude that spatial systematics in
the SV data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control in
current clustering and weak lensing analyses. The framework presented here is
relevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploiting
future surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will
require detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations to
correctly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky.

the galaxy where we can compare CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 sizes we find these are also
very similar. Assuming a Galactic CO-to-H$_2$ conversion, we measure surface
densities of $\Sigma_{mol}\sim1200$ M$_\odot$pc$^{-2}$ in projection and
estimate $\Sigma_{mol}\sim500-900$ M$_\odot$pc$^{-2}$ deprojected. Finally, our

ratios $r_{31}$ that are approximately unity. In addition to the similar disk
sizes, the very similar line profiles in J=1-0 and J=3-2 indicate that both

coextensive. We conclude that in these two main sequence galaxies there is no
evidence for significant excitation gradients or a large molecular reservoir

gravitationally bound because their radii are significantly less than what
would be expected from freely expanding clumps of stars with a typical initial
stellar velocity dispersion of ~3 km/s for star-forming regions. We explore a
model for cluster formation in which structurally simpler clusters are built up
hierarchically through the mergers of subclusters--subcluster mergers are
indicated by an inverse relation between the numbers of stars in a subcluster

less steep than would be expected from pure expansion). We discuss implications
of these effects for the dynamical relaxation of young stellar clusters.

replacement of the canonical H2A histone with the variants macroH2A and H2A.Z
has been shown to affect DNA accessibility and nucleosome stability; however,
the processes by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate
the molecular mechanisms of these variants with an extensive molecular dynamics
study of the canonical nucleosome along with three variant-containing
structures: H2A.Z, macroH2A, and an H2A mutant with macroH2A-like L1 loops.
Simulation results show that variant L1 loops play a pivotal role in
stabilizing DNA binding to the octamer through direct interactions, core
structural rearrangements, and altered allosteric networks in the nucleosome.
All variants influence dynamics; however, macroH2A-like systems have the
largest effect on energetics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis
of allosteric networks in the nucleosome and demonstrate that variants take
advantage of stronger interactions between L1 loops to propagate dynamics
throughout the complex. Furthermore, we show that post-translational
modifications are enriched at key locations in these networks. Taken together,
these results provide new insights into the relationship between the structure,
dynamics, and function of the nucleosome core particle and chromatin fibers,

assembled after the last giant impact on Earth. Due to its high temperature,
the protolunar disk may act as a thermochemical reactor in which the material
is processed before being incorporated into the Moon. Outstanding issues like
devolatilisation and istotopic evolution are tied to the disk evolution,
however its lifetime, dynamics and thermodynamics are unknown. Here, we
numerically explore the long term viscous evolution of the protolunar disk
using a one dimensional model where the different phases (vapor and condensed)
are vertically stratified. Viscous heating, radiative cooling, phase
transitions and gravitational instability are accounted for whereas Moon s
accretion is not considered for the moment. The viscosity of the gas, liquid
and solid phases dictates the disk evolution. We find that (1) the vapor
condenses into liquid in about 10 years, (2) a large fraction of the disk mass
flows inward forming a hot and compact liquid disk between 1 and 1.7 Earth s
radii, a region where the liquid is gravitationally stable and can accumulate,
(3) the disk finally solidifies in 1000 to 100,000 years. Viscous heating is
never balanced by radiative cooling. If the vapor phase is abnormally viscous,
due to magneto-rotational instability for instance, most of the disk volatile
components are transported to Earth leaving a disk enriched in refractory
elements. This opens a way to form a volatile-depleted Moon and would suggest
that the missing Moon s volatiles are buried today into the Earth. The disk
cooling timescale may be long enough to allow for planet-disk isotopic
equilibration. However large uncertainties on the disk physics remain because
of the complexity of its multi-phased structure.

  Possible infinite entropy of the stochastic vector $Q_\infty$ which
determines the metric relations for partitions of the generalized L\""uroth

absence of general formulae for the calculation of the Hausdorff dimension even

for a device to be localized to lack a sufficient number of detectable
positioning signals from localized devices to determine its location without
ambiguity (i.e., to be uniquely localizable). This occurrence is well-known to
be a limiting factor in localization performance, especially in communications
systems. In cellular positioning, for example, cellular network designers call
this the hearability problem. We study the conditions required for unique
localizability and use tools from stochastic geometry to derive accurate
analytic expressions for the probabilities of meeting these conditions in the
noncollaborative and collaborative cases. We consider the scenario without
shadowing, the scenario with shadowing and universal frequency reuse, and,
finally, the shadowing scenario with random frequency reuse. The results from
the latter scenario, which apply particularly to cellular networks, reveal that
collaboration between two devices separated by only a short distance yields
drastic improvements in both devices' abilities to uniquely determine their

delving further into techniques which enhance cellular positioning with

plasmonic vortices with arbitrary topological charge. The general principles
for designing plasmonic helical gratings that facilitate efficient generation
of such plasmonic vortices are derived and their applicability to the
conversion of plasmonic vortices with zero angular momentum into plasmonic
vortices with arbitrary angular momentum is illustrated in several particular
cases. Our analysis, based both on the exact solutions for the electromagnetic

suggests that even in the presence of metal losses the fundamental mode with
topological charge m=0 can be converted to plasmon vortex modes with
topological charge m=1 and m=2 with a conversion efficiency as large as 60%.

galaxies, to get new insights into the baryonic processes in galaxy formation
and evolution. For this purpose, we solve the equations for the evolutions of
the surface mass densities of gas and metals at each radius in a galactic disk,
based on the observed structural properties of distant star-forming galaxies,
including the redshift evolution of their stellar mass distribution, their
scaling relation between the mass of baryonic components, star formation rate
(SFR) and chemical abundance, as well as the supposed evolution of their radial
metallicity gradients (RMGs). We find that the efficiency of gas inflow for a
given SFR decreases with time and that the inflow rate is always nearly
proportional to the SFR. For gas outflow, although its efficiency for a given
SFR is a decreasing function of time, similarly to gas inflow, the outflow rate
is not necessarily proportional to the SFR and the relation between the outflow
rate and SFR strongly depends on the evolution of the adopted RMG. We also find
that the results on the outflow rate can be reproduced in the framework of
momentum-driven (energy-driven) wind mechanism if the RMG is steepening
(flattening) with time. Therefore if the well measured RMGs and their evolution
for Milky Way-like galaxies are obtained from future observations, then our
results will be useful to constrain the main driving mechanism for their
galactic outflows.

moderate accuracy. Our primary motivation is that this method, together with
properly chosen semi-proximal terms, such as those generated by the recent
advance of symmetric Gauss-Seidel technique, is applicable to tackling these
problems. Moreover, the proposed method, which relaxes both the primal and the
dual variables in a natural way with one relaxation factor in the interval
$(0,2)$, has the potential of enhancing the performance of the classic ADMM.
Extensive numerical experiments on various doubly non-negative semidefinite
programming problems, with or without inequality constraints, are conducted.
The corresponding results showed that all these multi-block problems can be
successively solved, and the advantage of using the relaxation step is
apparent.

recent history. Such approaches tend to work in a unidirectional bottom-up
feed-forward fashion. However, practical experience and biological evidence
tells us that feedback plays a crucial role, particularly for detailed spatial
understanding tasks. This work explores bidirectional architectures that also
reason with top-down feedback: neural units are influenced by both lower and
higher-level units.
  We do so by treating units as rectified latent variables in a quadratic
energy function, which can be seen as a hierarchical Rectified Gaussian model
(RGs). We show that RGs can be optimized with a quadratic program (QP), that
can in turn be optimized with a recurrent neural network (with rectified linear
units). This allows RGs to be trained with GPU-optimized gradient descent. From
a theoretical perspective, RGs help establish a connection between CNNs and
hierarchical probabilistic models. From a practical perspective, RGs are well
suited for detailed spatial tasks that can benefit from top-down reasoning. We
illustrate them on the challenging task of keypoint localization under
occlusions, where local bottom-up evidence may be misleading. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.

radially projected to S^3, the sphere in 4D space, then stereographically
projected to 3D space where they are viewed in the headset. The orientation of
the headset is given by an element of the group SO(3), which is also a space
that is double covered by S^3. In fact, the headset outputs a point of this
double cover: a unit quaternion. The positions of the cells are multiplied by
this quaternion before projection to 3D space, which moves the player through
S^3. When the player is sufficiently close to a cell, they eat it. The aim of
the game is to eat all of the cells of the polytope, which, roughly speaking,
is achieved by moving one's head through all possible orientations, twice.

  Lift-and-Convexification Approach",,,"10.1137/15M1012232",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider in this paper a class of semi-continuous quadratic programming
problems which arises in many real-world applications such as production
planning, portfolio selection and subset selection in regression. We propose a
lift-and-convexification approach to derive an equivalent reformulation of the
original problem. This lift-and-convexification approach lifts the quadratic
term involving $x$ only in the original objective function $f(x,y)$ to a
quadratic function of both $x$ and $y$ and convexifies this equivalent
objective function. While the continuous relaxation of our new reformulation
attains the same tight bound as achieved by the continuous relaxation of the
well known perspective reformulation, the new reformulation also retains the
linearly constrained quadratic programming structure of the original
mix-integer problem. This prominent feature improves the performance of
branch-and-bound algorithms by providing the same tightness at the root node as
the state-of-the-art perspective reformulation and offering much faster
processing time at children nodes. We further combine the
lift-and-convexification approach and the quadratic convex reformulation
approach in the literature to form an even tighter reformulation. Promising
results from our computational tests in both portfolio selection and subset
selection problems numerically verify the benefits from these theoretical
features of our new reformulations.

of magnitude smaller material loss. By applying temporal coupled mode theory to
a Fano-resonant waveguide platform, we reveal that the required material loss
and following absorption Q-factor are ultimately determined by the degree of
Fano spectral asymmetry. The feasibility of the Fano anti-laser is confirmed
using a photonic crystal platform, to demonstrate spatio-spectrally selective
heating. Our results utilizing the phase-dependent control of device bandwidths
derive a counterintuitive realization of high-Q perfect conversion of light

of physical systems can be related to one or more thermostatistical ensembles.
Here, we survey the notion of thermodynamic temperature in different
statistical ensembles, focusing in particular on subtleties that arise when
ensembles become non-equivalent. The 'mother' of all ensembles, the
microcanonical ensemble, uses entropy and internal energy (the most
fundamental, dynamically conserved quantity) to derive temperature as a
secondary thermodynamic variable. Over the past century, some confusion has
been caused by the fact that several competing microcanonical entropy
definitions are used in the literature, most commonly the volume and surface
entropies introduced by Gibbs. It can be proved, however, that only the volume
entropy satisfies exactly the traditional form of the laws of thermodynamics
for a broad class of physical systems, including all standard classical
Hamiltonian systems, regardless of their size. This mathematically rigorous
fact implies that negative 'absolute' temperatures and Carnot efficiencies $>1$
are not achievable within a standard thermodynamical framework. As an important
offspring of microcanonical thermostatistics, we shall briefly consider the
canonical ensemble and comment on the validity of the Boltzmann weight factor.
We conclude by addressing open mathematical problems that arise for systems
with discrete energy spectrum.

the particles in the one-dimensional case, i.e. the single-file diffusion

It is demonstrated that the dynamical system surely exhibits SOC

the cluster size distribution, and the distribution of the time interval
between intermittent avalanches. During the network evolution, fractal networks
are spontaneously generated when networks experience critical cascades of

image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which
integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a
unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text
recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties:
(1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms
whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles
sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or
horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined
lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and
lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet
much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application
scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K,
Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm
performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which
evidently verifies the generality of it.

hierarchy of general multi-source multi-sink hyperedge networks under network
coding, which includes multiple network models, such as independent distributed
storage systems and index coding problems, as special cases. A notion of
minimal networks and a notion of network equivalence under group action are
defined. An efficient algorithm capable of directly listing single minimal
canonical representatives from each network equivalence class is presented and
utilized to list all minimal canonical networks with up to 5 sources and
hyperedges. Computational tools are then applied to obtain the rate regions of
all of these canonical networks, providing exact expressions for 744,119 newly
solved network coding rate regions corresponding to more than 2 trillion
isomorphic network coding problems. In order to better understand and analyze
the huge repository of rate regions through hierarchy, several embedding and
combination operations are defined so that the rate region of the network after
operation can be derived from the rate regions of networks involved in the
operation. The embedding operations enable the definition and determination of
a list of forbidden network minors for the sufficiency of classes of linear
codes. The combination operations enable the rate regions of some larger
networks to be obtained as the combination of the rate regions of smaller
networks. The integration of both the combinations and embedding operators is
then shown to enable the calculation of rate regions for many networks not
reachable via combination operations alone.

yield strength corresponding to microhard GB conditions, is not applicable in
the continuum model. A combination of a finite GB yield strength with an
isotropic bulk Voce hardening relation alone also fails to model the plastic
strain profiles obtained by DDD. Instead, a finite GB yield strength in
combination with GB hardening depending on the equivalent plastic strain at the
GBs is shown to give a better agreement to DDD results. The differences in the
plastic strain profiles obtained in DDD simulations by using different
orientations of the central grain could not be captured, indicating that the
misorientation dependent elastic interaction of dislocations reaching over the

in the fact that gravity is weak and requires large masses to be detectable.
But for large masses, it becomes increasingly difficult to generate spatial
quantum superpositions, which live sufficiently long to be detected. A delicate
balance between opposite quantum and gravitational demands is needed. Here we
show that this can be achieved in an optomechanics scenario. We propose an
experimental setup, which allows to decide whether the gravitational field
generated by a quantum system in a spatial superposition is the superposition
of the two alternatives, or not. We estimate the magnitude of the effect and
show that it offers good perspectives for observability. Performing the

of the topic. Criminal networks are covert and most of the information is not
publicly available. This leads to small datasets available for analysis. The
available criminal network datasets consists of entities, i.e. individual or
organizations, which are linked to each other. The links between entities
indicates that there is a connection between these entities such as involvement
in the same criminal event, having commercial ties, and/or memberships in the
same criminal organization. Because of incognito criminal activities, there
could be many hidden links from entities to entities, which makes the publicly
available criminal networks incomplete. Revealing hidden links introduces new
information, e.g. affiliation of a suspected individual with a criminal
organization, which may not be known with public information. What will we be
able to find if we can run analysis on a larger dataset and use link prediction
to reveal the implicit connections? We plan to answer this question by using a
dataset that is an order of magnitude more than what is used in most criminal
networks analysis. And by using machine learning techniques, we will convert a
link prediction problem to a binary classification problem. We plan to reveal
hidden links and potentially hidden key attributes of the criminal network.
With a more complete picture of the network, we can potentially use this data
to thwart criminal organizations and/or take a Pareto approach in targeting key
nodes. We conclude our analysis with an effective destruction strategy to
weaken criminal networks and prove the effectiveness of revealing hidden links
when attacking to criminal networks.

""scale-invariant"" gravitational constant, Q0 (in MOND, Q0=A0=Ga0, where a0 is

be complete concentration of hydrogen atoms in these planes. As a result the

defined in terms of projective measurements of initial and final energies. This
definition leads to statistical distributions of work that satisfy
nonequilibrium work and fluctuation relations. While this two-point measurement
definition of quantum work can be justified heuristically by appeal to the
first law of thermodynamics, its relationship to the classical definition of
work has not been carefully examined. In this paper we employ semiclassical
methods, combined with numerical simulations of a driven quartic oscillator, to
study the correspondence between classical and quantal definitions of work in
systems with one degree of freedom. We find that a semiclassical work
distribution, built from classical trajectories that connect the initial and
final energies, provides an excellent approximation to the quantum work
distribution when the trajectories are assigned suitable phases and are allowed
to interfere. Neglecting the interferences between trajectories reduces the
distribution to that of the corresponding classical process. Hence, in the
semiclassical limit, the quantum work distribution converges to the classical
distribution, decorated by a quantum interference pattern. We also derive the
form of the quantum work distribution at the boundary between classically
allowed and forbidden regions, where this distribution tunnels into the
forbidden region. Our results clarify how the correspondence principle applies
in the context of quantum and classical work distributions, and contribute to
the understanding of work and nonequilibrium work relations in the quantum

construct a new KFC model with 73\% reduction in total number of parameters,

achieve 35\% reduction in total number of parameters given similar quality
degradation allowance. If we only compare the KFC layer with its counterpart
fully-connected layer, the reduction in the number of parameters exceeds 99\%.
The amount of computation is also reduced as we replace matrix product of the

KFC layers. Further experiments on MNIST, SVHN and some Chinese Character

\emph{rumor spreading} and \emph{majority consensus} can plausibly be achieved
in biological systems subject to noisy communication channels, where every

$\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$, without using coding techniques. This result is a
considerable step towards a better understanding of the way biological entities
may cooperate. It has been nevertheless be established only in the case of
2-valued \emph{opinions}: rumor spreading aims at broadcasting a single-bit
opinion to all nodes, and majority consensus aims at leading all nodes to adopt
the single-bit opinion that was initially present in the system with (relative)
majority. In this paper, we extend this previous work to $k$-valued opinions,

for handling channels carrying $k$-\emph{valued} messages. In fact, we
precisely characterize the type of noise patterns for which plurality consensus
is solvable. Also, a key result employed in the bivalued case by Feinerman et
al. is an estimate of the probability of observing the most frequent opinion
from observing the mode of a small sample. We generalize this result to the

We observe that the monotonicity of the Gaussian interferometric power under
the action of local Gaussian quantum channels on the ancillary arm of the
bipartite probes is a natural indicator of Markovian dynamics; consequently,
its breakdown for specific maps can be used to construct a witness and an
effective quantifier of non-Markovianity. In our work, we consider two
paradigmatic Gaussian models, the damping master equation and the quantum
Brownian motion, and identify analytically and numerically the parameter
regimes that give rise to non-Markovian dynamics. We then quantify the degree

showing in particular that even nonentangled probes can be useful to witness

molecular clouds. The most massive ones represent some of the most likely
birthplaces for the next generation of massive stars in the Milky Way. Because

are usually assumed to be nearby.
  Aims: We use THz absorption spectroscopy to solve the distance ambiguity
associated with kinematic distances for the IR-dark clouds in the TOP100
ATLASGAL sample, a flux-limited selection of massive clumps in different
evolutionary phases of star formation.
  Methods: The para-H2O ground state transition at 1113.343 GHz, observed with
Herschel/HIFI, was used to investigate the occurrence of foreground absorption
along the line of sight directly towards infrared-dark clouds. Additional
consistency checks were performed using MALT90 and HiGAL archival data and
targeted Mopra and APEX spectroscopic observations.
  Results: We report the first discovery of five IRDCs in the TOP100 lying
conclusively at the far kinematic distance, showing that the mere presence of
low-contrast mid-IR absorption is not sufficient to unequivocally resolve the
near/far ambiguity in favour of the former. All IRDCs are massive and actively
forming high-mass stars; four of them also show infall signatures.
  Conclusions: We give a first estimate of the fraction of dark sources at the
far distance (~11% in the TOP100) and describe their appearance and properties.
The assumption that all dark clouds lie at the near distance may lead, in some
cases, to underestimating masses, sizes, and luminosities, possibly causing
clouds to be missed that will form very massive stars and clusters.

  Robust Optimization","31 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The joint management of heat and power systems is believed to be key to the
integration of renewables into energy systems with a large penetration of
district heating. Determining the day-ahead unit commitment and production
schedules for these systems is an optimization problem subject to uncertainty
stemming from the unpredictability of demand and prices for heat and
electricity. Furthermore, owing to the dynamic features of production and heat
storage units as well as to the length and granularity of the optimization
horizon (e.g., one whole day with hourly resolution), this problem is in
essence a multi-stage one. We propose a formulation based on robust
optimization where recourse decisions are approximated as linear or
piecewise-linear functions of the uncertain parameters. This approach allows
for a rigorous modeling of the uncertainty in multi-stage decision-making
without compromising computational tractability. We perform an extensive
numerical study based on data from the Copenhagen area in Denmark, which
highlights important features of the proposed model. Firstly, we illustrate
commitment and dispatch choices that increase conservativeness in the robust
optimization approach. Secondly, we appraise the gain obtained by switching
from linear to piecewise-linear decision rules within robust optimization.
Furthermore, we give directions for selecting the parameters defining the
uncertainty set (size, budget) and assess the resulting trade-off between
average profit and conservativeness of the solution. Finally, we perform a
thorough comparison with competing models based on deterministic optimization
and stochastic programming.

Moreover, we demonstrate message count unfairness when Trickle uses a unique

redundancy constant for each node as a function of its number of neighbors. Our
calculated redundancy constants reduce unfairness among nodes by distributing
more equally the number of transmitted messages in the network. Our analytical

models. Assuming that the flame starts in a point-like region slightly above
the center of the white dwarf (WD) and adding a moderate amount of angular
velocity to the star we follow the evolution of the deflagration using a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. We find that the results are very
dependent on the angle between the rotational axis and the line connecting the
initial bubble of burned material with the center of the white dwarf at the
moment of the ignition. The impact of rotation is larger for angles close to
90{\deg} because the Coriolis force on a floating element of fluid is maximum,
and its principal effect is to break the symmetry of the deflagration. Such
symmetry breaking weakens the convergence of the nuclear flame at the antipodes
of the initial ignition volume, changing the environmental conditions around
the convergence region with respect to non-rotating models. These changes seem
to disfavor the emergence of a detonation in the compressed volume at the
antipodes, thus compromising the viability of the so called gravitational
confined detonation mechanism.

$T_{ls}(X)/\overline{T_{qc}(X)}$ and $T_{ls}(X)/\overline{T_0(X)}$ are
contractible in the Teichm\""uller metric and the length spectrum metric,

Russian 6-m telescope to study its kinematics and stellar population. The
previous studies gave basis to suspect that this galaxy possesses a peculiarly
low mass-to-light ratio $M/L_B$ of stellar population which could indicate the
presence of bottom-light stellar initial mass function (IMF). The ratio $M/L_B$
estimated for different evolutionary models of stellar population using both
the broad-band magnitudes and the detailed spectral data confirms this
peculiarity if the disc inclination angle $i>30^o$, as it was obtained earlier
from the optical photometry, in a good agreement with the HI data cube
modelling. However the re-processing of HI data cube we carried out showed that
it is compatible with much lower value $i=13^o$ corresponding to the ""normal""
ratio $M/L_B$, which does not need any peculiar stellar IMF. Stellar velocity
dispersion measured at one disc radial scalelength from the center also better
agrees with the low disc inclination. However in this case we should admit that
the disc possesses a non-axisymmetric shape even after taking into account a
two-armed spiral structure.
  The derived stellar kinematic profiles reveal a signature of kinematically
decoupled nuclear disc in the galaxy. Using different evolution models of
stellar population we estimated the stellar metallicity [Z/H] (-0.4, -0.5 and
-0.3 dex) and the mean luminosity-weighted (for the luminosity in the spectral
range $4800-5570$ \AA) stellar age (4.2, 2.6 and 2.3 Gyr) for the bulge, disc
and nuclear disc of this galaxy respectively.

fundamental issue in condensed matter physics. As a prototypical example of a
disorder-tuned QPT, the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) has been
investigated intensively over the past three decades, but as yet without a
general consensus on its nature. A key element is good control of disorder.
Here, we present an experimental study of the SIT based on precise in-situ
tuning of disorder in dual-gated bilayer graphene proximity-coupled to two
superconducting electrodes through electrical and reversible control of the
band gap and the charge carrier density. In the presence of a static disorder
potential, Andreev-paired carriers formed close to the Fermi level in bilayer
graphene constitute a randomly distributed network of proximity-induced
superconducting puddles. The landscape of the network was easily tuned by
electrical gating to induce percolative clusters at the onset of
superconductivity. This is evidenced by scaling behavior consistent with the
classical percolation in transport measurements. At lower temperatures, the
solely electrical tuning of the disorder-induced landscape enables us to
observe, for the first time, a crossover from classical to quantum percolation
in a single device, which elucidates how thermal dephasing engages in
separating the two regimes.

recent research suggests that the problem is in QP. Moreover, we state the BZ

applies sorting networks, as well as the general itemset isomorphism problem.

Three different non-local datasets are used, ALHAMBRA and SXDS (examples of
deep ground-based surveys), and COSMOS (deep space-based survey). We used a
sample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring their
morphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). Then we simulated
them to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in the
non-local surveys. The comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints on
the use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate the
effectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. All
analysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,
the impact of the former being much stronger. When including asymmetry and
smoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken into
account carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. M20 is significantly
affected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at all
brightness levels.We suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parameters
should be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,
independently of their brightness; for COSMOS they should be avoided for
galaxies fainter than F814 = 23.0. These results can be applied directly to
surveys similar to ALHAMBRA, SXDS and COSMOS, and also can serve as an
upper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

studies because it provides us with an independent estimation of the age of the

Sun, which are determined by means of calibrated solar models that employ
different equations of state and nuclear reaction rates. We use 17 frequency
separation ratios
$r_{02}(n)=(\nu_{n,l=0}-\nu_{n-1,l=2})/(\nu_{n,l=1}-\nu_{n-1,l=1})$ from 8640
days of low-$\ell$ BiSON frequencies and consider three likelihood functions
that depend on the handling of the errors of these $r_{02}(n)$ ratios.
Moreover, we employ the 2010 CODATA recommended values for Newton's constant,
solar mass, and radius to calibrate a large grid of solar models spanning a
conceivable range of solar ages. It is shown that the most constrained
posterior distribution of the solar age for models employing Irwin EOS with
NACRE reaction rates leads to $t_\odot = 4.587 \pm 0.007$ Gyr, while models
employing the Irwin EOS and Adelberger, et al., Reviews of Modern Physics, 83,
195 (2011) reaction rate have $t_\odot = 4.569 \pm 0.006 $ Gyr. Implementing
OPAL EOS in the solar models results in reduced evidence ratios (Bayes factors)
and leads to an age that is not consistent with the meteoritic dating of the
solar system. An estimate of the solar age that relies on an helioseismic age
indicator such as $r_{02}(n)$ turns out to be essentially independent of the
type of likelihood function. However, with respect to model selection,
abandoning any information concerning the errors of the $r_{02}(n)$ ratios
leads to inconclusive results, and this stresses the importance of evaluating
the trustworthiness of error estimates.

in the interpretation of the time-energy uncertainty relations as lower bounds
for the minimal evolution time between two distinguishable states of a quantum

uniqueness of a bona fide measure of distinguishability defined on the quantum
state space affects the quantum speed limits and can be exploited in order to
derive improved bounds. Specifically, we establish an infinite family of
quantum speed limits valid for unitary and nonunitary evolutions, based on an
elegant information geometric formalism. Our work unifies and generalizes
existing results on quantum speed limits, and provides instances of novel
bounds which are tighter than any established one based on the conventional

demonstrating the importance of choosing different information metrics for open

techniques for non-convex optimization problems over the last few years, all
existing results establish either local convergence with good rates or global
convergence with highly suboptimal rates, for many problems of interest. In
this paper, we take the first step in getting the best of both worlds --
establishing global convergence and obtaining a good rate of convergence for
the problem of computing squareroot of a positive definite (PD) matrix, which
is a widely studied problem in numerical linear algebra with applications in
machine learning and statistics among others. Given a PD matrix $M$ and a PD
starting point $U_0$, we show that gradient descent with appropriately chosen
step-size finds an $\epsilon$-accurate squareroot of $M$ in $O(\alpha \log
(\|M-U_0^2\|_F /\epsilon))$ iterations, where $\alpha =
(\max\{\|U_0\|_2^2,\|M\|_2\} / \min \{\sigma_{\min}^2(U_0),\sigma_{\min}(M) \}
)^{3/2}$. Our result is the first to establish global convergence for this
problem and that it is robust to errors in each iteration. A key contribution
of our work is the general proof technique which we believe should further
excite research in understanding deterministic and stochastic variants of
simple non-convex gradient descent algorithms with good global convergence
rates for other problems in machine learning and numerical linear algebra.

for the interparticle potential, constitutes a model for glasses, and indeed an
extremely simple and manageable one. Indeed, it allows one to describe the
landscape of the minima of the potential energy and to deal concretely with any
one of them, determining the spectrum of frequencies and the normal modes. A
relevant role is played by the harmonic energy $\mathcal E$ relative to a given
minimum, i.e., the expansion of the Hamiltonian about the minimum up to second
order. Indeed we find that there exists an energy threshold in $\mathcal E$
such that below it the harmonic energy $\mathcal E$ appears to be an
approximate integral of motion for the whole observation time. Consequently,
the system remains trapped near the minimum, in what may be called a vitreous
or glassy state. Instead, for larger values of $\mathcal E$ the system rather
quickly relaxes to a final equilibrium state. Moreover we find that the
vitreous states present peculiar statistical behaviors, still involving the
harmonic energy $\mathcal E$. Indeed, the vitreous states are described by a
Gibbs distribution with an effective Hamiltonian close to $\mathcal E$ and with
a suitable effective inverse temperature. The final equilibrium state presents
instead statistical properties which are in very good agreement with the Gibbs
distribution relative to the full Hamiltonian of the system.

neural responses to natural sounds by decoding their time-varying acoustic
features. The model allows to decode natural sounds from high-dimensional
neural recordings, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), that track timing and
location of human cortical signalling noninvasively across multiple channels.
We used the MEG responses recorded from subjects listening to acoustically
different environmental sounds. By decoding the stimulus frequencies from the
responses, our model was able to accurately distinguish between two different
sounds that it had never encountered before with 70% accuracy. Convolution
models typically decode frequencies that appear at a certain time point in the
sound signal by using neural responses from that time point until a certain
fixed duration of the response. Using our model, we evaluated several fixed
durations (time-lags) of the neural responses and observed auditory MEG
responses to be most sensitive to spectral content of the sounds at time-lags
of 250 ms to 500 ms. The proposed model should be useful for determining what
aspects of natural sounds are represented by high-dimensional neural responses
and may reveal novel properties of neural signals.

from noisy samples. Existing work has focused on approximating the least
squares solution by using leverage-based scores as an importance sampling
distribution. However, no finite sample statistical guarantees and no
computationally efficient optimal sampling strategies have been proposed. To
evaluate the statistical properties of different sampling strategies, we
propose a simple yet effective estimator, which is easy for theoretical
analysis and is useful in multitask linear regression. We derive the exact mean
square error of the proposed estimator for any given sampling scores. Based on
minimizing the mean square error, we propose the optimal sampling scores for
both estimator and predictor, and show that they are influenced by the
noise-to-signal ratio. Numerical simulations match the theoretical analysis
well.

momentum between the crust and the interior of the star. Recently, it was
inferred that the moment of inertia of the crust of a neutron star is not
sufficient to explain the observed glitches. Such estimates are presumed in the
Einstein's general relativity in describing the hydrostatic equilibrium of
neutron stars. The crust of the neutron star has a space-time curvature of 14
orders of magnitude larger than that probed in solar system tests. This makes
gravity the weakest constrained physics input in the crust related processes.
We calculate the ratio of the crustal to the total moment of inertia of neutron
stars in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity and the non-perturbative $f({\cal
R})={\cal R}+ a {\cal R}^2$ gravity. We find for the former that the crust to
core ratio of the moment of inertia does not change significantly from what is
inferred in general relativity. For the latter we find that the ratio increases
significantly from what is inferred in general relativity in the case of high
mass objects. Our results suggest that the glitch activity of pulsars may be
used to probe gravity models, although the gravity models explored in this work
are not appropriate candidates.

the average time of consensus by a factor of 5.68 in real-world networks. The
edge betweenness centrality also identifies -in a smaller proportion- those

states present in the van der Waals Equation of State. From a convex
optimization problem on the Helmoltz free energy of a mixture, we deduce a
dynamical system that is able to depict the mass transfer between two phases,
for which equilibrium states are either metastable states, stable states or {a
coexistent state}. The dynamical system is then used as a relaxation source
term in an isothermal 4$\times$4 two-phase model. We use a Finite Volume scheme
that treats the convective part and the source term in a fractional step way.
Numerical results illustrate the ability of the model to capture phase
transition and metastable states.

analyzing the movement of a test particle and the modification caused by
extrinsic curvature on its movement. Accordingly, using the asymptotically
conformal flat condition for the extrinsic curvature, an analytical expansion
of a set of \emph{n}-scalar fields can be defined and we show that the
corresponding black holes must be large and constrained in the range of allowed
values $-1/2 \leq n \leq 1.8$. As a result, they are locally thermodynamically
stable, but not globally preferred.

expected to be modified due to nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED)
properties. Several experimental tests using high intensity lasers have been
proposed to observe electromagnetic nonlinearities in vacuum, such as the
diffraction or the reflection of intense laser pulses. We propose a new
approach which consists in observing the refraction, i.e. the rotation of the
waveplanes of a probe laser pulse crossing a transverse vacuum index gradient.
The latter is produced by the interaction of two very intense and ultra short
laser pulses, used as pump pulses. At the maximum of the index gradient, the
refraction angle of the probe pulse is estimated to be $0.2 \times
(\frac{w_0}{10 \mathrm{\mu m}})^{-3} \times \frac{I}{1
\mathrm{J}}$~picoradians, where $I$ is the total energy of the two pump pulses
and $w_0$ is the minimum waist (fwhm) at the interaction area. Assuming the
most intense laser pulses attainable by the LASERIX facility ($I = 25$~J, 30~fs
fwhm duration, 800~nm central wavelength) and assuming a minimum waist of $w=10
\mathrm{\mu m}$ (fwhm) (corresponding to an intensity of the order of
$10^{21}$~W/cm$^2$), the expected maximum refraction angle is about
5~picoradians. An experimental setup, using a Sagnac interferometer, is
proposed to perform this measurement.

review the anomalies for classical and exceptional groups, retrieving trace
identities up to the sixth power of the curvature for each class of groups. We
expand this idea for low-dimensional groups, for which the trace of the sixth
power is known to factorize, and we retrieve such factorization. We obtain the
total anomaly polynomials for individual low dimensional groups and
combinations of them and finally we investigate their non-factorization, in
such a way that U(1)^496and E_8 xU(1)^248 are non-trivially shown to be the

checking the factorization of gauge theories, we retrieve the Green-Schwarz

invariant. However a calculation of the vacuum polarization tensor will include
non-gauge invariant terms. These terms must be removed from the calculation in
order to get a physically correct result. One common way to do this today is
the technique of ""dimensional regularization"". It has recently been noted [2]
that at one time a supersymmetric-like solution to the problem was explored -
that is, the right combination of fields would cause the offending terms to
cancel out. I will examine some of this early work and pose the question - why
do the non-gauge invariant terms appear in the first place? I will show that
this is due to an improper mathematical step in the formulation of the
pertubative expansion. I will then show that when this step is corrected the
result is gauge invariant. However a supersymmetric-like solution is still
required to cancel out a divergent term.
