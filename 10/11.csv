non-Hamiltonian volume preserving systems (VPS): an extended standard map, and
a fluid model. The extended map is a standard map weakly coupled to an
extra-dimension which contains a deterministic regular, mixed (regular and
chaotic) or chaotic motion. The extra-dimension strongly enhances the trapping
times inducing plateaus and distinct algebraic and exponential decays in the
RTS plots. The combined analysis of the RTS with the classification of ordered
and chaotic regimes and scaling properties, allows us to describe the intricate
way trajectories penetrate the before impenetrable regular islands from the
uncoupled case. Essentially the plateaus found in the RTS are related to
trajectories that stay long times inside trapping tubes, not allowing
recurrences, and then penetrates diffusively the islands (from the uncoupled
case) by a diffusive motion along such tubes in the extra-dimension. All
asymptotic exponential decays for the RTS are related to an ordered regime
(quasi-regular motion) and a mixing dynamics is conjectured for the model.
These results are compared to the RTS of the standard map with dissipation or
noise, showing the peculiarities obtained by using three-dimensional VPS. We
also analyze the RTS for a fluid model and show remarkable similarities to the
RTS in the extended standard map problem.

messages and multiple receivers each wanting a subset of messages and knowing a
different set of messages a priori. The noiseless Index Coding Problem is to
identify the minimum number of transmissions (optimal length) to be made by the
source through noiseless channels so that all receivers can decode their wanted
messages using the transmitted symbols and their respective prior information.
Recently, it is shown that different optimal length codes perform differently
in a noisy channel. Towards identifying the best optimal length index code one
needs to know the number of optimal length index codes. In this paper we
present results on the number of optimal length index codes making use of the
representation of an index coding problem by an equivalent network code. Our
formulation results in matrices of smaller sizes compared to the approach of
Kotter and Medard. Our formulation leads to a lower bound on the minimum number
of optimal length codes possible for all unicast index coding problems which is
met with equality for several special cases of the unicast index coding
problem. A method to identify the optimal length codes which lead to
minimum-maximum probability of error is also presented.

critical. This choice balances the tradeoff between model parsimony and data

However, cross-validation is computationally time consuming and often precludes
valid post-selection inference without further considerations. With this in
mind, borrowing elements from the objective Bayesian variable selection
literature, we propose an approach to select the degree of a polynomial basis.
Although the method can be extended to most series-based smoothers, we focus on
estimates arising from Bernstein polynomials for the regression function, using
mixtures of g-priors on the model parameter space and a hierarchical
specification for the priors on the order of smoothness. We prove the
asymptotic predictive optimality for the method, and through simulation
experiments, demonstrate that, compared to cross-validation, our approach is
one or two orders of magnitude faster and yields comparable predictive
accuracy. Moreover, our method provides simultaneous quantification of model

asymptotically tight bounds to accurately quantify the approximation

efficient implementation in modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), where it
outperforms previous alternative approaches by exploiting the fixed-function

tackling systems in external trapping potentials: a uniform-lattice approach
with hard-wall boundary conditions, and a non-uniform Gauss-Hermite lattice
approach. Using those two methods, we compute the ground-state energy and
spatial density profile for systems of N=4 - 8 harmonically trapped fermions in
one dimension. From the favorable comparison of both energies and density
profiles (particularly in regions of low density), we conclude that the
trapping potential is properly resolved by the hard-wall basis. Our work paves
the way to higher dimensions and finite temperature analyses, as calculations
with the hard-wall basis can be accelerated via fast Fourier transforms, the
cost of unaccelerated methods is otherwise prohibitive due to the unfavorable
scaling with system size.

  Boltzmann Equation in Bounded Domain (I)","58 pages, To appear on Comm. Pure Appl. Math",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We establish the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier limit for solutions to
the Boltzmann equation with a general cut-off collision kernel in a bounded
domain. Appropriately scaled families of DiPerna-Lions-(Mischler) renormalized
solutions with Maxwell reflection boundary conditions are shown to have
fluctuations that converge as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Every limit
point is a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with different
types of boundary conditions depending on the ratio between the accommodation
coefficient and the Knudsen number. The main new result of the paper is that
this convergence is strong in the case of Dirichlet boundary condition. Indeed,
we prove that the acoustic waves are damped immediately, namely they are damped
in a boundary layer in time. This damping is due to the presence of viscous and
kinetic boundary layers in space. As a consequence, we also justify the first
correction to the infinitesimal Maxwellian that one obtains from the
Chapman-Enskog expansion with Navier-Stokes scaling.
  This extends the work of Golse and Saint-Raymond \cite{Go-Sai04, Go-Sai05}
and Levermore and Masmoudi \cite{LM} to the case of a bounded domain. The case
of a bounded domain was considered by Masmoudi and Saint-Raymond \cite{M-S} for
linear Stokes-Fourier limit and Saint-Raymond \cite{SRM} for Navier-Stokes
limit for hard potential kernels. Both \cite{M-S} and \cite{SRM} didn't study
the damping of the acoustic waves. This paper extends the result of \cite{M-S}
and \cite{SRM} to the nonlinear case and includes soft potential kernels. More
importantly, for the Dirichlet boundary condition, this work strengthens the
convergence so as to make the boundary layer visible. This answers an open
problem proposed by Ukai \cite{Ukai}.

that case, we show that the possible EHs of the deformed FPW reflect the known
possible types of edge theories, which are generically gapped, but gapless if

based on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and
efficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations
of motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive
implementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB,
the present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark
the accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a
time-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically
trapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We
demonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion
Schr\""odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can
hence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with
time-dependent one-body and two-body potentials. As an application we study the
problem of two initially parabolically confined and charged fermions tunneling
through a barrier to open space. We demonstrate the validity of a model
proposed previously for the many-body tunneling to open space of bosonic
particles with contact interactions [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109,
13521-13525 (2012)]. The many-fermion tunneling can be built up from
sequentially happening single-fermion tunneling processes. The characteristic
momenta of these processes are determined by the chemical potentials of trapped
subsystems of smaller particle numbers: the escaped fermions convert the
different chemical potentials into kinetic energy. Using the two-body
correlation function, we present a detailed picture of the sequentiality of the
process and are able to tell tunneling from over-the-barrier escape.

cannibalism in the predator primarily, and show that predator cannibalism in

ecological evidence that cannibalism exists among prey as well, yet this
phenomenon has been much less investigated. In the current manuscript, we
investigate both the ODE and spatially explicit forms of a Holling-Tanner
model, with ratio dependent functional response. We show that cannibalism in
the predator provides a stabilizing influence as expected. However, when
cannibalism in the prey is considered, we show that it cannot stabilise the
unstable interior equilibrium in the ODE case, but can destabilise the stable
interior equilibrium. In the spatially explicit case, we show that in certain
parameter regime, prey cannibalism can lead to pattern forming Turing dynamics,
which is an impossibility without it. Lastly we consider a stochastic prey
cannibalism rate, and find that it can alter both spatial patterns, as well as

presence and distribution of categories of human activity (e.g., eating,

classification is then evaluated through its comparison with the patterns of
temporal variation of mobile phone activity and applying machine learning
techniques to predict a timeline type of communication activity in a given

the locations areas. The proposed classification turns out to be more

The autonomous motions of the colloids are due to a catalytic chemical reaction
taking place asymmetrically on their surfaces that generates a concentration
gradient of interactive solutes around the particles and actuate particle
propulsion. We consider two spherical particles with symmetric catalytic caps
extending over the local polar angles $\theta^1_{cap}$ and $\theta^2_{cap}$
from the centers of active sectors in an otherwise quiescent fluid. A combined
analytical-numerical technique was developed to solve the coupled mass transfer
equation and the hydrodynamics in the Stokes flow regime. The ensuing pair
trajectory of the colloids is controlled by the reacting coverages
$\theta^j_{cap}$ and their initial relative orientation with respect to each
other. Our analysis indicates two possible scenarios for pair trajectories of
catalytic self-propelled particles: either the particles approach, come into
contact and assemble or they interact and move away from each other (escape).
For arbitrary motions of the colloids, it is found that the direction of
particle rotations is the key factor in determining the escape or assembly
scenario. Based on the analysis, a phase diagram is sketched for the pair
trajectory of the catalytically active particles as a function of active
coverages and their initial relative orientations. We believe this study has
important implications in elucidation of collective behaviors of
auotophoretically self-propelled colloids.

nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant
subspace. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that
evolves observable functions of the state-space of a dynamical system [Koopman
1931, PNAS]. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed
using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the
state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too
restrictive for nonlinear systems [Williams et al. 2015, JNLS]. Choosing
nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is
possible to obtain linear models, especially those that are useful for control,
is an open challenge.
  Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis
that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems.
First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the
observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible
when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed
points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate
to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a
finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then
present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for
Koopman analysis using a new algorithm to determine terms in a dynamical system
by sparse regression of the data in a nonlinear function space [Brunton et al.
2015, arxiv]; we show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we
demonstrate how to design optimal control laws for nonlinear systems using
techniques from linear optimal control on Koopman invariant subspaces.

we stochastically binarize weights to convert multiplications involved in
computing hidden states to sign changes. Second, while back-propagating error
derivatives, in addition to binarizing the weights, we quantize the
representations at each layer to convert the remaining multiplications into
binary shifts. Experimental results across 3 popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10,

descent training, paving the way to fast, hardware-friendly training of neural

into research issues, and overview our studies which utilized four different
sources of text materials in this paper. We investigated the history of
concepts and transliterated words in China with the Database for the Study of
Modern China Thought and Literature, which contains historical documents about
China between 1830 and 1930. We also attempted to disambiguate names that were
shared by multiple government officers who served between 618 and 1912 and were
recorded in Chinese local gazetteers. To showcase the potentials and challenges
of computer-assisted analysis of Chinese literatures, we explored some
interesting yet non-trivial questions about two of the Four Great Classical
Novels of China: (1) Which monsters attempted to consume the Buddhist monk
Xuanzang in the Journey to the West (JTTW), which was published in the 16th
century, (2) Which was the most powerful monster in JTTW, and (3) Which major
role smiled the most in the Dream of the Red Chamber, which was published in
the 18th century. Similar approaches can be applied to the analysis and study
of modern documents, such as the newspaper articles published about the 228
incident that occurred in 1947 in Taiwan.

project continuous grayscale images onto the surrounding walls. Given the
geometry of the lampshade and a target grayscale image, our method computes a
distribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of
the light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse
surface. Our objective is to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial
detail of the target image, to the extent possible within the constraints of
the fabrication process.
  To ensure structural integrity, there are lower bounds on the thickness of
the shell, the radii of the holes, and the minimal distances between adjacent
holes. Thus, the holes are realized as thin tubes distributed over the
lampshade surface. The amount of light passing through a single tube may be
controlled by the tube's radius and by its direction (tilt angle). The core of
our technique thus consists of determining a suitable configuration of the
tubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well
as the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by
computing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined
density function, and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of
each tessellation cell. The density function for a particular target image is
derived from a series of simulated images, each corresponding to a different
uniform density tube pattern on the lampshade.

simulations of tapped systems built from frictional disks and pentagons, and
study the structure of the force networks of granular packings by considering

clusters and loops observed in the force networks as a function of the force

contact forces are considered, whereas they are surprisingly similar for the

  In this thesis, we propose a novel approach for mining entity trivia from
their Wikipedia pages. Given an entity, our system extracts relevant sentences
from its Wikipedia page and produces a list of sentences ranked based on their
interestingness as trivia. At the heart of our system lies an interestingness
ranker which learns the notion of interestingness, through a rich set of
domain-independent linguistic and entity based features. Our ranking model is
trained by leveraging existing user-generated trivia data available on the Web
instead of creating new labeled data for movie domain. For other domains like
sports, celebrities, countries etc. labeled data would have to be created as
described in thesis. We evaluated our system on movies domain and celebrity
domain, and observed that the system performs significantly better than the
defined baselines. A thorough qualitative analysis of the results revealed that
our engineered rich set of features indeed help in surfacing interesting trivia

and the recent evidence of long-lived quantum coherence in biological light
harvesting complexes has triggered much excitement, due to the evocative
possibility that these systems - essential to practically all life on earth --
use quantum mechanical effects to achieve optimal functionality. A large body
of theoretical work has addressed the role of local environments in determining
the transport properties of excitons in photosynthetic networks and the
survival of quantum coherence in a classical environment. Nonetheless,
understanding the connection between quantum coherence, exciton network
geometry and energy transfer efficiency remains a challenge. Here we address
this connection from the perspective of heat transfer within the exciton
network. Using a non-equilibrium open quantum system approach and focusing on
the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that finite local dephasing
can be beneficial to the overall power output. The mechanism for this
enhancement of power output is identified as a gentle balance between quantum
and classical contributions to the local heat flow, such that the total heat
flow is directed along the shortest paths and dissipation is minimized.
Strongly related to the spatial network structure of the exciton transfer
complex, this mechanism elucidates how energy flows in photosyntetic excitonic
complexes.

underlying problem with space-time white noise (Q = I) allows for a mild
solution with a positive order of regularity in multiple spatial dimensions.
Further, we analyze a spatio-temporal discretization of the problem, performed
by a standard finite element method in space and a well-known linear implicit
Euler scheme in time. The analysis of the approximation error forces us to
significantly enrich existing error estimates of semidiscrete and fully
discrete finite element methods for the corresponding linear deterministic

exhibit promising multiferroic properties, and Y2CoMnO6 (YCMO) is one candidate
in this category. However, the microscopic origins for magnetically induced
ferroelectricity in YCMO remain unclear. In this work, we perform detailed
symmetry analysis on the exchange striction effect and lattice distortion, plus
the first-principles calculations on YCMO. The E*-AFM state as the ground state
with other competing states such as ferromagnetic and A-antiferromagnetic
orders is confirmed. It is revealed that the ferroelectricity is generated by
the exchange striction associated with the E*-AFM order and chemically rdered
Mn/Co occupation. Both the lattice symmetry consideration and first-principles
calculations predict that the electric polarization aligns along the b-axis.
The calculated polarization reaches up to 0.4682 uC/cm2, mainly from the ionic
displacement contribution. The present work presents a comprehensive

research areas. Constraint based causal exploration algorithms, such as PC,
FCI, RFCI, PC-simple, IDA and Joint-IDA have achieved significant progress and
have many applications. A common problem with these methods is the high
computational complexity, which hinders their applications in real world high
dimensional datasets, e.g gene expression datasets. In this paper, we present
an R package, ParallelPC, that includes the parallelised versions of these
causal exploration algorithms. The parallelised algorithms help speed up the
procedure of experimenting big datasets and reduce the memory used when running
the algorithms. The package is not only suitable for super-computers or
clusters, but also convenient for researchers using personal computers with
multi core CPUs. Our experiment results on real world datasets show that using
the parallelised algorithms it is now practical to explore causal relationships
in high dimensional datasets with thousands of variables in a single multicore
computer. ParallelPC is available in CRAN repository at

from the rheological measurements, if the data are correctly normalized by the
viscosity of the suspending phase since a significant amount of polymers adsorb
to the cell surfaces. We find that the position of the maximum of this shear
rate dependent bell shape increases with increasing viscosity of the suspending

unstructured nature of records and obligatory requirement of domain

of this study is to overcome this challenge with a methodical analysis,
abstraction and summarization of such data. This is an attempt to explain
clinical observations through bio-medical and genomic data. Discharge summaries
of obesity patients were processed to extract coherent patterns. This was
supported by Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based
technologies and concept mapping tool along with biomedical, clinical and
genomic knowledge bases. Semantic relations between diseases were extracted and
filtered through Chi square test to remove spurious relations. The remaining
relations were validated against biomedical literature and gene interaction
networks. A collection of binary relations of diseases was derived from the
data. One set implied co-morbidity while the other set contained diseases which
are risk factors of others. Validation against bio-medical literature increased
the prospect of correlation between diseases. Gene interaction network revealed
that the diseases are related and their corresponding genes are in close
proximity. Conclusion: This study focuses on deducing meaningful relations
between diseases from discharge summaries. For analytical purpose, the scope
has been limited to a few common, well-researched diseases. It can be extended
to incorporate relatively unknown, complex diseases and discover new traits to

error-correcting schemes can be arbitrarily far from achieving the optimal
network throughput. A new transform metric for errors under the considered

results from coding theory. Specifically, we prove new Hamming-type,
Plotkin-type, and Elias-Bassalygo-type upper bounds on the network capacity. A
commensurate lower bound is shown based on Gilbert-Varshamov-type codes for
error-correction. The GV codes used to attain the lower bound can be
non-coherent, that is, they do not require prior knowledge of the network
topology. We also propose a computationally-efficient concatenation scheme. The
rate achieved by our concatenated codes is characterized by a Zyablov-type
lower bound. We provide a generalized minimum-distance decoding algorithm which
decodes up to half the minimum distance of the concatenated codes. The
end-to-end nature of our design enables our codes to be overlaid on the

potentially intensive computation at internal nodes for the link-by-link

quantum codes. We show that this engineering optimization problem can be
reduced to the solution of standard binary linear programs. While solving such

theory. We will show that a mechanism to prevent black hole formation is needed
in 4 dimensions to make string theory a viable high energy model of quantum
gravity. Black hole formation may be averted by a gravity regulation mechanism
based on string condensation. In this scenario, black holes are replaced by
`hot holograms' that form during gravitational collapse. The geometric
conditions based on the properties of free thermalon solutions that are
proposed for conversion to a high temperature hologram to occur, however, are
local and generic in dimension and could apply throughout M space. This idea
can be applied to resolve the problems presented by the process of black hole
evaporation, which appears to be inconsistent with quantum information theory.
Whereas, in the conventional view, black holes are real and firewalls are
probably a chimera, in the scenario proposed here that situation would be
reversed.

in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are presented. The data
were taken with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated
luminosity of about 270 inverse nanobarns. The correlations are studied over a
broad range of pseudorapidity (abs(eta) < 2.4) and over the full azimuth (phi)
as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum (pt). In
high-multiplicity events, a long-range (abs(Delta eta) > 2.0), near-side (Delta
phi approximately 0) structure emerges in the two-particle Delta eta-Delta phi
correlation functions. The magnitude of the correlation exhibits a pronounced
maximum in the range 1.0 < pt < 2.0 GeV/c and an approximately linear increase
with the charged particle multiplicity, with an overall correlation strength
similar to that found in earlier pp data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. The present
measurement extends the study of near-side long-range correlations up to
charged particle multiplicities of N[ch] approximately 180, a region so far
unexplored in pp collisions. The observed long-range correlations are compared
to those seen in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions at lower collision energies.

the use of multichannel scattering theory. We present multichannel scattering
matrix elements in terms of the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the
second kind. Through the use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we derive an
infinite series of Feynman diagrams that represent the solution to the integral
equation. We use the Feynman diagrams as vertex correction terms to come up
with closed form formulas that successfully predict the trapping rate of a
photon in the atom-photon bound state. We verify our formalism through
Krylov-subspace based numerical studies with pulsed excitations. Our results
provide the tools to calculate the complex correlations between scattered
photons in a dispersive environment.

telescopes, the physical status of interstellar medium and star formation in
these regions have been revealed. In a relatively large infrared dust bubble,
active star formation is undergoing and the shell is still expanding. Signs of
compressed gas and triggered star formation have been tentatively detected in a
relatively small bubble. The dense cores in the Rosette Molecular Complex
detected at 1.1 mm using SMA have been speculated to have a likely triggered
origin according to their spatial distribution. Although some observational
results have been obtained, more efforts are necessary to reach trustworthy
conclusions.
