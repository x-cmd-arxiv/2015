growing evidence of pronounced spatial inhomogeneity in the conductivity at

unknown. We study interfaces based on amorphous LAO top layers grown at room

\mathrm{mK}$, higher than any previously reported values for c-LAO/STO. The
dependence of the superconducting critical current on temperature, magnetic

potential due to spacetime geometry and topology. This recently discovered
attractive force on neutral atoms is caused by the thermal radiation emitted
from black bodies and here we investigate it in relativistic gravitational
systems with spherical and cylindrical symmetries. For some astrophysical
objects we find that the corrected black-body potential is greater than the
flat case, showing that this kind of correction can be quite relevant when
curved spaces are considered. Then we consider four cases: The Schwarzschild
spacetime, the global monopole, the non-relativistic infinity cylinder and the
static cosmic string. For the spherically symmetric case of a massive body, we
find that two corrections appear: One due to the gravitational modification of
the temperature and the other due to the modification of the solid angle
subtended by the atom. We apply the found results to a typical neutron star and
to the Sun. For the global monopole, the modification in the black-body
potential is of topological nature and it is due to the central solid angle
deficit that occurs in the spacetime generated by that object. In the
cylindrical case, which is locally flat, no gravitational correction to the
temperature exists, as in the global monopole case. However, we find the
curious fact that the BBF depends on the topology of the spacetime through the
modification of the azimuthal angle and therefore of the solid angle. For the
static cosmic string we find that the force is null for the zero thickness
case.

unstratified shearing box simulations. Earlier numerical work reported only a
very weak dependence at best, results that call into question the canonical
alpha-disk model and the thermal stability results that follow from it. Our
simulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that
previous work was box-size limited: turbulent `eddies' were artificially
restricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scale height.
Zero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress
proportional to $P^{0.5}$, where P is pressure. The stresses are also
proportional to the grid length and hence remain numerically unconverged. The
same runs with physical diffusivities, however, give a result closer to an
alpha-disk: the stress is proportional to $P^{0.9}$. Net-flux simulations
without explicit diffusion exhibit stresses proportional to $P^{0.5}$, but
stronger imposed fields weaken this correlation. In summary, compressibility is
important for the saturation of the MRI, but the exact stress-pressure
relationship is difficult to ascertain in local simulations because of
numerical convergence issues and the influence of any imposed flux. As a
consequence, the interpretation of thermal stability behaviour in local
simulations is a problematic enterprise.

observation in the 0.3 to 10.0 keV energy band. Archival infrared WISE
observations at 8, 12 and 24 \mu m were also used to investigate the properties
of the source and its surroundings at different wavelengths. The results show
that the extended X-ray emission is predominantly soft (0.3-1.2 keV) and peaks
around 0.5 keV, which shows that it is an extremely soft SNR. X-ray emission
correlates very well with central regions of bright radio emission. On the west
side the radio/X-ray emission displays a plane-like feature with a terminal
wall where strong infrared emission is detected. Our spatially resolved X-ray
spectral analysis confirms that the emission is dominated by weak atomic
emission lines of N, O, Ne, and Fe, all of them undetected in previous X-ray
studies. These characteristics suggest that the X-ray emission is originated in
an optically thin thermal plasma, whose radiation is well fitted by a
non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma (VNEI) X-ray emission model. Our
study favors a scenario where G332.5-5.6 is expanding in a medium with an

However, more stringent tests, focusing on reproducing multitechnique

the predictions of the VDD model under specific circumstances. In the case of
nearby, bright Be star $\beta$ CMi, these circumstances are a very stable
low-density disk and a late-type (B8Ve) central star. The aim is to test the
VDD model thoroughly, exploiting the full diagnostic potential of individual
types of observations, in particular, to constrain the poorly known structure
of the outer disk if possible, and to test truncation effects caused by a
possible binary companion using radio observations. We use the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code HDUST to produce model observables, which we compare
with a very large set of multitechnique and multiwavelength observations that
include ultraviolet and optical spectra, photometry covering the interval
between optical and radio wavelengths, optical polarimetry, and optical and
near-IR (spectro)interferometry. Due to the absence of large scale variability,
data from different epochs can be combined into a single dataset. A parametric
VDD model with radial density exponent of $n$ = 3.5, which is the canonical
value for isothermal flaring disks, is found to explain observables typically
formed in the inner disk, while observables originating in the more extended
parts favor a shallower, $n$ = 3.0, density falloff. Modeling of radio
observations allowed for the first determination of the physical extent of a Be
disk (35$^{+10}_{-5}$ stellar radii), which might be caused by a binary
companion. Finally, polarization data allowed for an indirect measurement of
the rotation rate of the star, which was found to be $W \gtrsim 0.98$, i.e.,
very close to critical.

giving rise to a symmetry lowering to P2_1/m. In the nonmagnetic DFT
structures, the two growth orientations are equally favored for all tensile
strains considered here, as well as for compressive strains weaker than -3%.
For stronger compressive strains, the P2_1/m orientation is favored and shows a
complete suppression of octahedral tilts along the out-of-plane direction.
Magnetically-ordered structures do not show a complete tilt suppression, but
the trend points to a similar reduction of the out-of-plane V-O-V bond angles
under compressive strain. Our DMFT calculations show that, in accord with
room-temperature experiments, the bulk paramagnetic Mott-insulating state of
LaVO_3 is robust against epitaxial strains attainable in thin films, since the
suppression of orbital fluctuations counteracts the effect of bandwidth
increase with compressive strain. Under stronger compressive strains, the
straightening of the V-O-V bonds in the P2_1/m geometry interferes with the
suppression of orbital fluctuations and hence perturbs the Mott phase more
strongly, albeit not enough to achieve a metallic phase.

flexible blades, scaled to be dynamically similar to natural aquatic
vegetation, forced by wave-induced oscillatory flows. For the conditions
tested, blade motion is governed primarily by two dimensionless variables: (i)
the Cauchy number, $Ca$, which represents the ratio of the hydrodynamic forcing
to the restoring force due to blade stiffness, and (ii) the ratio of the blade
length to the wave orbital excursion, $L$. For flexible blades with $Ca \gg 1$,
the relationship between drag and velocity can be described by two different
scaling laws at the large- and small-excursion limits. For large excursions ($L
\ll 1$), the flow resembles a unidirectional current and the scaling laws
developed for steady-flow reconfiguration studies hold. For small excursions
($L \gg 1$), the beam equations may be linearized and a different scaling law
for drag applies. The experimental force measurements suggest that the
small-excursion scaling applies even for intermediate cases with $L \sim O(1)$.
The numerical model employs the well-known Morison force formulation, and
adequately reproduces the observed blade dynamics and measured hydrodynamic
forces without the use of any fitted parameters. For $Ca \gg 1$, the movement
of the flexible blades reduces the measured and modeled hydrodynamic drag
relative to a rigid blade of the same morphology. However, in some cases with
$Ca \sim O(1)$, the measured hydrodynamic forces generated by the flexible
blades exceed those generated by rigid blades, but this is not reproduced in
the model. Observations of blade motion suggest that this unusual behavior is
related to an unsteady vortex shedding event, which the simple numerical model
cannot reproduce. Finally, we also discuss implications for the modeling of
wave energy dissipation over canopies of natural aquatic vegetation.

traits when designing mass efficient systems that must interact with uncertain
environments. Various promising control approaches have been proposed for
tensegrity systems in simulation. Unfortunately, state estimation methods for
tensegrity robots have not yet been thoroughly studied.
  In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a state estimator for
tensegrity robots. This state estimator will enable existing and future control
algorithms to transfer from simulation to hardware. Our approach is based on
the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and combines inertial measurements, ultra
wideband time-of-flight ranging measurements, and actuator state information.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the SUPERball, a tensegrity
based planetary exploration robotic prototype. In particular, we conduct tests
for evaluating both the robot's success in estimating global position in
relation to fixed ranging base stations during rolling maneuvers as well as
local behavior due to small-amplitude deformations induced by cable actuation.

which were reported to be above 60~TeV. In this paper, we fit the diffuse
neutrino spectrum using Poisson statistics, which are the most appropriate for
the low counts per energy bin. We extend the fitted energy range and exploit
the fact that no neutrinos were detected above 2~PeV, despite the high detector
sensitivity around the Glashow resonance at 6.3\,PeV and beyond. A best-fit
power-law slope of $\alpha=2.9\pm 0.3$ is found with no evidence for a
high-energy cutoff. This slope is steeper than $\alpha=2.3\pm 0.3$ found by the
IceCube team using a different fitting method. Such a steep spectrum
facilitates the identification of high energy ($\gg$ PeV) neutrinos, if
detected, to be due to the GZK effect of cosmic-ray protons interacting with
the Extragalactic Background Light. We use the ratio of EeV to PeV neutrinos in
GZK models to show that the currently detected PeV neutrinos could not be due
to the GZK effect, because this would imply many more higher-energy neutrinos
that should have been detected, but were not. The non-detection of GZK
neutrinos by IceCube despite more than essentially 1200 observing days, has
already ruled out (at 95\% confidence) models that predict rates of $\sim1$
neutrino/yr or more. We use this non-detection to quantify the confidence at
which GZK models are ruled out, and compute the additional IceCube and (in the
future) ARA observing time that would rule them out with 95\% confidence if no
detection is made.

mapped a 2.4' $\times$ 2.4' region towards the molecular cloud N159-W in the
$^{13}$CO J=3-2 line and observed several molecular lines at an IR peak very
close to a massive young stellar object. $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 were
observed towards two positions in N166 and one position in N132. The $^{13}$CO
J=3-2 map of the N159-W cloud shows that the molecular peak is shifted
southwest compared to the peak of the IR emission. Towards the IR peak we
detected emission from HCN, HNC, HCO$^{+}$, C$_{2}$H J=4-3, CS J=7-6, and
tentatively C$^{18}$O J=3-2. This is the first reported detection of these
molecular lines in N159-W. The analysis of the C$_{2}$H line yields more
evidence supporting that the chemistry involving this molecular species in
compact and/or UCHII regions in the LMC should be similar to that in Galactic
ones. A non-LTE study of the CO emission suggests the presence of both cool and
warm gas in the analysed region. The same analysis for the CS, HCO$^{+}$, HCN,
and HNC shows that it is very likely that their emissions arise mainly from
warm gas with a density between $5 \times 10^5$ to some $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. The
obtained HCN/HNC abundance ratio greater than 1 is compatible with warm gas and
with an star-forming scenario. From the analysis of the molecular lines
observed towards N132 and N166 we propose that both regions should have similar
physical conditions, with densities of about 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$.

the receiver. There is also an external eavesdropper who intercepts the
communications. The goal is to transmit the messages reliably while keeping
them confidential from the eavesdropper. To accomplish this goal, two different
approaches have been proposed in prior works, namely, i.i.d. Gaussian random
coding and real alignment. However, the former approach fails at moderate and
high SNR regimes as its achievable result does not grow with SNR. On the other
hand, while the latter approach gives a promising result at the infinite SNR
regime, its extension to the finite-SNR regime is a challenging task. To fill
the gap between the performance of the existing approaches, in this work, we
establish a new scheme in which, at the receiver's side, it utilizes an
extension of the compute-and-forward decoding strategy and at the transmitters'
side it exploits lattice alignment, cooperative jamming, and i.i.d. random
codes. For the proposed scheme, we derive a new achievable bound on sum secure
rate which scales with log(SNR) and hence it outperforms the i.i.d. Gaussian
codes in moderate and high SNR regimes. We evaluate the performance of our
scheme, both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that our sum
secure rate achieves the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom in the
infinite-SNR regime.

additive interactions among the mesogenic cores, the model yields up to three

spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, manifested primarily by the twisting of

about network structure and labels of some training subset of nodes is called
the within-network classification. It may happen that none of the labels of the

to which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be
selected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is: ""labels of
which nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to provide the
best classification accuracy for the whole network?"". Active learning and
inference is a practical framework to study this problem.
  A set of methods for active learning and inference for within network
classification is proposed and validated. The utility score calculation for
each node based on network structure is the first step in the process. The
scores enable to rank the nodes. Based on the ranking, a set of nodes, for
which the labels are acquired, is selected (e.g. by taking top or bottom N from
the ranking). The new measure-neighbour methods proposed in the paper suggest
not obtaining labels of nodes from the ranking but rather acquiring labels of
their neighbours. The paper examines 29 distinct formulations of utility score
and selection methods reporting their impact on the results of two collective
classification algorithms: Iterative Classification Algorithm and Loopy Belief
Propagation.
  We advocate that the accuracy of presented methods depends on the structural
properties of the examined network. We claim that measure-neighbour methods
will work better than the regular methods for networks with higher clustering
coefficient and worse than regular methods for networks with low clustering
coefficient. According to our hypothesis, based on clustering coefficient we
are able to recommend appropriate active learning and inference method.

fully nonlinear elliptic equations under minimal, asymptotic assumptions on the
governing operator $F$. By means of geometric tangential methods, we show that
if the {\it recession} of the operator $F$ -- formally given by
$F^*(M):=\infty^{-1} F(\infty M)$ -- is convex, then any viscosity solution to
the original equation $F(D^2u) = f(x)$ is locally of class $W^{2,p}$, provided
$f\in L^p$, $p>d$, with appropriate universal estimates. Our result extends to
operators with variable coefficients and in this setting they are new even
under convexity of the frozen coefficient operator, $M\mapsto F(x_0, M)$, as
oscillation is measured only at the recession level. The methods further yield
BMO regularity of the hessian, provided the source lies in that space. As a
final application, we establish the density of $W^{2,p}$ solutions within the
class of all continuous viscosity solutions, for generic fully nonlinear
operators $F$. This result gives an alternative tool for treating common issues
often faced in the theory of viscosity solutions.

framework. After the theoretical bound for distributed storage was derived by
the pioneer work of the regenerating code, Reed-Solomon code based regenerating
codes were developed. The RS code based minimum storage regeneration code
(RS-MSR) and the minimum bandwidth regeneration code (RS-MBR) can achieve
theoretical bounds on the MSR point and the MBR point respectively in code
regeneration. They can also maintain the MDS property in code reconstruction.
However, in the hostile network where the storage nodes can be compromised and
the packets can be tampered with, the storage capacity of the network can be
significantly affected. In this paper, we propose a Hermitian code based
minimum storage regenerating (H-MSR) code and a minimum bandwidth regenerating
(H-MBR) code. We first prove that our proposed Hermitian code based
regenerating codes can achieve the theoretical bounds for MSR point and MBR

algorithms for the H-MSR code and the H-MBR code in both error-free network and

detect the erroneous decodings and correct more errors in hostile network than
the RS-MSR code and the RS-MBR code with the same code rate. Our analysis also
demonstrates that the proposed H-MSR and H-MBR codes have lower computational
complexity than the RS-MSR/RS-MBR codes in both code regeneration and code

Lamb shift measurements is significantly smaller than that extracted from
atomic hydrogen and electron scattering measurements.
  [Purpose] In an attempt to understand the discrepancy, we review
high-precision electron scattering results from Mainz, Jefferson Lab, Saskatoon
and Stanford.
  [Method] We make use of stepwise regression techniques using the $F$-test as
well as the Akaike information criterion to systematically determine the
predictive variables to use for a given set and range of electron scattering
data as well as to provide multivariate error estimates.
  [Results] Starting with the precision, low four-momentum transfer ($Q^2$)
data from Mainz (1980) and Saskatoon (1974), we find that a stepwise regression
of the Maclaurin series using the $F$-test as well as the Akaike information
criterion justify using a linear extrapolation which yields a value for the
proton radius that is consistent with the result obtained from muonic hydrogen
measurements. Applying the same Maclaurin series and statistical criteria to
the 2014 Rosenbluth results on $G_E$ from Mainz, we again find that the
stepwise regression tends to favor a radius consistent with the muonic hydrogen
radius but produces results that are extremely sensitive to the range of data
included in the fit. Making use of the high-$Q^2$ data on $G_E$ to select
functions which extrapolate to high $Q^2$, we find that a Pad\'e ($N=M=1$)
statistical model works remarkably well, as does a dipole function with a 0.84
fm radius, $G_E(Q^2) = ( 1 + Q^2/0.66\,\mathrm{GeV}^2)^{-2}$.
  [Conclusions] From this statistical analysis, we conclude that the electron
scattering result and the muonic hydrogen result are consistent. It is the
atomic hydrogen results that are the outliers.

calculate the secret key rate for a given protocol. Analytical formulas are
known for protocols with symmetries, since symmetry simplifies the analysis.
However, experimental imperfections break symmetries, hence the effect of
imperfections on key rates is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, it is an
interesting question whether (intentionally) asymmetric protocols could
outperform symmetric ones. Here, we develop a robust numerical approach for
calculating the key rate for arbitrary discrete-variable QKD protocols.
Ultimately this will allow researchers to study ""unstructured"" protocols, that
is, those that lack symmetry. Our approach relies on transforming the key rate
calculation to the dual optimization problem, which dramatically reduces the
number of parameters and hence the calculation time. We illustrate our method
by investigating some unstructured protocols for which the key rate was
previously unknown.

of loadings and observed means does not make sense. It was also shown that for

activity, and thus the chiral magnetic effect. While for purely static magnetic
fields the chiral magnetic effect is known to have a topological origin and to
be related to the presence of Berry curvature monopoles (Weyl points) in the
band structure, we show that the existence of Berry monopoles is not required
for the dynamic chiral magnetic effect to appear; the latter is thus not unique
to Weyl metals. The magnitude of the dynamic chiral magnetic effect in a

conditions under which this trace is non-zero; in noncentrosymmetric Weyl

quantum statistics. These include the weakly interacting 3D Bose gas, the
strongly interacting Fermi gas at unitarity in the presence of highly elongated

very broad class of one-group continuous shrinkage priors for simultaneous
estimation and testing of a sparse normal mean vector. Asymptotic optimality of
Bayes estimates and posterior concentration properties corresponding to the
general class of one-group priors under consideration are studied where the
data is assumed to be generated according to a multivariate normal distribution
with a fixed unknown mean vector. Under the assumption that the number of
non-zero means is known, we show that Bayes estimators arising out of this
general class of shrinkage priors under study, attain the minimax risk, up to
some multiplicative constant, under the $l_2$ norm. In particular, it is shown
that for the horseshoe-type priors such as the three parameter beta normal
mixtures with parameters $a=0.5, b>0$ and the generalized double Pareto prior
with shape parameter $\alpha=1$, the corresponding Bayes estimates become
asymptotically minimax. Moreover, posterior distributions arising out of this
general class of one-group priors are shown to contract around the true mean
vector at the minimax $l_2$ rate for a wide range of values of the global
shrinkage parameter depending on the proportion of non-zero components of the
underlying mean vector. An important and remarkable fact that emerges as a
consequence of one key result essential for proving the aforesaid minimaxity
result is that, within the asymptotic framework of Bogdan et al. (2011), the
natural thresholding rules due to Carvalho et al. (2010) based on the
horseshoe-type priors, asymptotically attain the optimal Bayes risk w.r.t. a
$0-1$ loss, up to the correct multiplicative constant and are thus,
asymptotically Bayes optimal under sparsity (ABOS).

projecting it onto a family of tractable distributions. In general, there is no

we introduce a new class of random projections to reduce the dimensionality and

quantum information try to better grasp the interplay between the structure of
quantum correlations and the constraints imposed by causality on physical
operations. Chapter 1 is dedicated to the study of the conceptual implications
of quantum nonlocality, a concept that subsumes that of entanglement in a
certain way. We detail the recent information-theoretic approaches to
understanding the structure of nonlocal correlations, and the issues the latter
raise concerning the ability of local observers to isolate a system from its
environment. Chapter 2 reviews in what sense imposing Poincare invariance
affects entanglement detection and quantification procedures. This invariance
ultimately forces a description of all quantum systems within the framework of
quantum field theory, which leads to the impossibility of localized
finite-energy states and to the divergence of all entanglement measures for
local observers. We provide a solution to these two problems by showing that
there exists a generic equivalence between a finite spatial resolution of the
measurement apparatus and the exclusion of high-energy degrees of freedom from
the definition of the observed system. This equivalence allows for an epistemic
interpretation of the standard quantum formalism describing nonrelativistic
localized systems and their correlations, hence a clarification of the origin
of the finite measures of entanglement between such systems. Chapter 3 presents
a recent theoretical framework that predicts the existence of correlations with
indefinite causal order. In analogy to the information-theoretic approaches to
nonlocal correlations, we introduce some principles that constrain the
structure of such correlations, which is a first step toward a clear
understanding of their physical origin.

(exceeding 20%), significant, and positively correlated, as expected. However,
both the mean values and the trends in these extinction ratios are drastically
shifted from the predictions of Cardelli and Fitzpatrick, regardless of how
$R_{V}$ is varied. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape of
the extinction curve has at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g.
$R_{V}$), which we conform with a principal component analysis. We derive a
median value of $<A_{V}/A_{Ks}>=13.44$, which is $\sim$60% higher than the

relatively impervious to extinction curve variations.
  Given that these extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology,
and that it is generally assumed that $R_{V}$ variations correctly capture
variations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in the
distance ladder from studies of type Ia supernovae and Cepheids may have been

shown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by $\sim$100%, and lack
sensitivity to extinction curve variations.

of the dilatation and chiral currents constrains low-energy constants which
enter the effective Lagrangian of $\chi$PT$_\sigma$. These constraints allow us
to obtain new phenomenological bounds on the dilaton decay constant via the
coupling of $\sigma/f_0$ to pions, whose value is known precisely from
dispersive analyses of $\pi\pi$ scattering. Improved predictions for $\sigma

massive planetesimal belt that is a few thousand times its current mass. Such a
picture, however, is incompatible with multiple lines of evidence. Here, we
present a new model for the conglomeration of Cold Classical Kuiper belt
objects, out of a solid belt only a few times its current mass, or a few
percent of the solid density in a Minimum Mass Solar Nebula. This is made
possible by depositing most of the primordial mass in grains of size centimetre
or smaller. These grains collide frequently and maintain a dynamically cold
belt out of which large bodies grow efficiently: an order-unity fraction of the
solid mass can be converted into large bodies, in contrast to the ~0.1%
efficiency in conventional models. Such a light belt may represent the true
outer edge of the Solar system, and it may have effectively halted the outward
migration of Neptune. In addition to the high efficiency, our model can also
produce a mass spectrum that peaks at an intermediate size, similar to the
observed Cold Classicals, if one includes the effect of cratering collisions.
In particular, the observed power-law break observed at ~30 km for Cold
Classicals, one that has been interpreted as a result of collisional erosion,
may be primordial in origin.

1D quantum systems at zero temperature. Here, we study a long-range interacting
spin chain with $U(1)$ symmetry and power-law interactions
$V(r)\sim1/r^\alpha$, directly relevant to ion-trap experiments. Using
bosonization and renormalization group theory, we find CSB for $\alpha$ smaller
than a critical exponent $\alpha_c(\le 3)$ depending on the microscopic
parameters of the model. Furthermore, the transition from the gapless XY phase
to the gapless CSB phase is mediated by the breaking of conformal symmetry due
to long-range interactions, and is described by a new universality class akin
to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analytical findings are

Spectrograph (COS). We have identified 42 absorbers at z < 0.16, comprising the
largest uniform blind sample size to date in this redshift range. Our
measurements indicate an increasing C IV absorber number density per comoving
path length (dN/dX = 7.5 +/- 1.1) and modestly increasing mass density relative
to the critical density of the Universe (Omega(C IV) = 10.0 +/- 1.5 x 10^-8 )
from z ~ 1.5 to the present epoch, consistent with predictions from
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Furthermore, the data support a
functional form for the column density distribution function that deviates from
a single power-law, also consistent with independent theoretical predictions.
As the data also probe heavy element ions in addition to C IV at the same
redshifts, we identify, measure, and search for correlations between column
densities of these species where components appear aligned in velocity. Among
these ion-ion correlations, we find evidence for tight correlations between C
II and Si II, C II and Si III, and C IV and Si IV, suggesting that these pairs
of species arise in similar ionization conditions. However, the evidence for
correlations decreases as the difference in ionization potential increases.
Finally, when controlling for observational bias, we find only marginal
evidence for a correlation (86.8% likelihood) between the Doppler line width
b(C IV) and column density N(C IV).

the next in such a way that cannot be reproduced by standard nucleosynthetic

cannot be solved by invoking heavy cluster mass loss (i.e. that clusters were
10-100 times more massive at birth) as this solution makes basic predictions

water and carbon dioxide have a large effect on the solidus temperature and
distribution of melting in the upper mantle. However, it has remained unclear
what effect small fractions of deep, volatile-rich melts have on melt transport
and reactive melting in the shallow asthenosphere. Here we present theory and
computations indicating that low-degree, reactive, volatile-rich melts cause
channelisation of magmatic flow at depths approximately corresponding to the
anhydrous solidus temperature. These results are obtained with a novel method
to simulate the thermochemical evolution of the upper mantle in the presence of
volatiles. The method uses a thermodynamically consistent framework for
reactive, disequilibrium, multi-component melting. It is coupled with a system
of equations representing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for a
partially molten grain aggregate. Application of this method in two-phase,
three-component upwelling-column models demonstrates that it reproduces
leading-order features of hydrated and carbonated peridotite melting; in
particular, it captures the production of low-degree, volatile-rich melt at
depths far below the volatile-free solidus. The models predict that segregation
of volatile-rich, deep melts promotes a reactive channeling instability that
creates fast and chemically isolated pathways of melt extraction. Reactive
channeling occurs where volatile-rich melts flux the base of the silicate
melting region, enhancing dissolution of fusible components from the ambient
mantle. We find this effect to be similarly expressed for models of both
hydrated and carbonated mantle melting. These findings indicate that despite
their small concentrations, water and carbon dioxide have an important control
on the extent and style of magma genesis, as well as on the dynamics of melt
transport.

d<500 kpc. The LRGs are characterized by a predominantly old (age>~1Gyr)
stellar population with 13% displaying [OII] emission features and LINER-like
spectra. Both passive and [OII]-emitting LRGs share the same stellar mass
distribution with a mean of <log(M*/Msun)>~11.4 and a dispersion of 0.2 dex.
Both LRG populations exhibit associated strong MgII absorbers out to d<500 kpc.
The mean gas covering fraction at d<~120 kpc is <kappa>_MgII > 15% and declines
quickly to <kappa>_MgII ~ 5% at d<~500 kpc. No clear dependence on stellar mass

dispersion of MgII absorbing gas relative to either passive or [OII]-emitting
LRGs is merely 60% of what is expected from virial motion in these massive
halos. While no apparent azimuthal dependence is seen for <kappa>_MgII around
passive LRGs at all radii, a modest enhancement in <kappa>_MgII is detected
along the major axis of [OII]-emitting LRGs at d<50 kpc. The suppressed
velocity dispersion of MgII absorbing gas around both passive and

are best-explained by a combination of cool clouds formed in thermally unstable
LRG halos and satellite accretion through filaments.

bound particle number and half-mass radius is approximately independent of

supergiants (RSGs) and luminous blue variables (LBVs), by using the fact that
these types of stars have infrared excess due to dust. The method is based on
3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry from archival ${\it Spitzer}$ Space
Telescope images of nearby galaxies. We applied our criteria to 4 dIrr
galaxies: Pegasus, Phoenix, Sextans A, and WLM, selecting 79 point sources,

mode. We identified 13 RSGs, of which 6 are new discoveries, also 2 new
emission line stars, and 1 candidate yellow supergiant. Among the other
observed objects we identified carbon stars, foreground giants, and background
objects, such as a quasar and an early-type galaxy that contaminate our survey.
We use the results of our spectroscopic survey to revise the mid-IR and optical
selection criteria for identifying RSGs from photometric measurements. The
optical selection criteria are more efficient in separating extragalactic RSGs
from foreground giants than mid-IR selection criteria, however the mid-IR
selection criteria are useful for identifying dusty stars in the Local Group.

tumor segmentation which, at its core, treats the problem of interactive brain
tumor segmentation as a machine learning problem.
  Methods: This method has an advantage over typical machine learning methods
for this task where generalization is made across brains. The problem with
these methods is that they need to deal with intensity bias correction and
other MRI-specific noise. In this paper, we avoid these issues by approaching
the problem as one of within brain generalization. Specifically, we propose a
semi-automatic method that segments a brain tumor by training and generalizing
within that brain only, based on some minimum user interaction.
  Conclusion: We investigate how adding spatial feature coordinates (i.e. $i$,
$j$, $k$) to the intensity features can significantly improve the performance
of different classification methods such as SVM, kNN and random forests. This
would only be possible within an interactive framework. We also investigate the
use of a more appropriate kernel and the adaptation of hyper-parameters
specifically for each brain.
  Results: As a result of these experiments, we obtain an interactive method
whose results reported on the MICCAI-BRATS 2013 dataset are the second most
accurate compared to published methods, while using significantly less memory

type-I metric, where the sources of the gravitational field are a fermionic and
a bosonic field, interacting through a Yukawa potential, following the standard
model of elementary particles. It is shown that the fermionic field has a
negative pressure, while the boson has a small positive pressure. The fermionic
field is the responsible for an accelerated regime at early times, but since
the total pressure tends to zero for large times, a transition to a decelerated
regime occurs. Here the Yukawa potential answers for the duration of the
accelerated regime, since by decreasing the value of its coupling constant the
transition accelerated-decelerated occurs in later times. The isotropization
which occurs for late times is due to the presence of the fermionic field as
one of the sources of the gravitational field.

divided into two sections: a small diameter section enclosing a thermoacoustic
stack, and a larger diameter section capped by a piezoelectric diaphragm tuned
to the thermoacoustically amplified mode (388 Hz). The diaphragm is modelled
with multi-oscillator broadband time-domain impedance boundary conditions
(TDIBCs), providing higher fidelity over single-oscillator approximations.
Simulations are first carried out to the limit cycle without energy extraction.
The observed growth rates are shown to be grid-convergent and are verified
against a numerical dynamical model based on Rott's theory. The latter is based
on a staggered grid approach and allows jump conditions in the derivatives of
pressure and velocity in sections of abrupt area change and the inclusion of
linearized minor losses. The stack geometry maximizing the growth rate is also
found. At the limit cycle, thermoacoustic heat leakage and frequency shifts are
observed, consistent with experiments. Upon activation of the piezoelectric
diaphragm, steady acoustic energy extraction and a reduced pressure amplitude
limit cycle are obtained. A heuristic closure of the limit cycle acoustic
energy budget is presented, supported by the linear dynamical model and the
nonlinear simulations. The developed high-fidelity simulation framework
provides accurate predictions of thermal-to-acoustic and acoustic-to-mechanical
energy conversion (via TDIBCs), enabling a new paradigm for the design and

to the field, of $(2700\pm700)\,M_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$ from all galaxies
contributing to this clustering signal within a radius of 3.5' from the SPT
DSFGs. The magnitude of the Planck excess is in broad agreement with
predictions of a current model of the cosmic infrared background. The model
predicts that 80$\%$ of the excess emission measured by Planck originates from
galaxies lying in the neighbouring halos of the lensing halo. Using Herschel
maps of the same fields, we find a clear excess, relative to the field, of
individual sources which contribute to the Planck excess. The mean excess SFR

receiver must decode its intended message locally, with the help of cooperation
either at the receivers side or at the transmitter side. In the case of
receiver cooperation, the receivers can process and share information through
limited capacity backhaul links. In contrast to various previously considered
distributed antenna architectures, where processing is utterly performed in a
centralized fashion, the model considered in this paper aims to capture the
essence of decentralized processing, allowing for a more general class of
""interactive"" interference management strategies. Focusing on the three-user
case, we characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the achievable
communication rates and the corresponding backhaul cooperation rate, in terms
of degrees of freedom (DoF). Surprisingly, we show that the optimum
communication-cooperation tradeoff per user remains the same when we move from
two-user to three-user interference channels. In the absence of cooperation,
this is due to interference alignment, which keeps the fraction of
communication dimensions wasted for interference unchanged. When backhaul
cooperation is available, we develop a new idea that we call cooperation
alignment, which guarantees that the average (per user) backhaul load remains
the same as we increase the number of users. In the case of transmitter
cooperation, the transmitters can form their jointly precoded signals through
an interactive protocol over the backhaul. In this case, we show that the
optimal (per user) tradeoff between the achievable communication rates and the
corresponding backhaul cooperation rate in the three-user case is the same as

heterogeneous nucleation of ice on graphitic surface is controlled by the
coupling of surface crystallinity and surface hydrophilicity. Molecular level
analysis reveals that the crystalline graphitic lattice with an appropriate
hydrophilicity may indeed template ice basal plane by forming a strained ice

the templating effect is found to transit from within the first contact layer
of water to the second as the hydrophilicity increases, yielding an oscillating
distinction between the crystalline and amorphous graphitic surfaces in their

set that we have assembled from a variety of sources, including law-enforcement
agencies, financial institutions, commercial database providers and other
similar organizations. The data set comprises networks of ""persons of interest""
with each network belonging to different categories such as suspected
terrorists, convicted individuals etc. We demonstrate that such ""anti-social""
networks are qualitatively different from the usual social networks and that
new techniques are required to identify and learn features of such networks for
the purposes of prediction and classification.
  We propose Cliqster, a new generative Bernoulli process-based model for
unweighted networks. The generating probabilities are the result of a
decomposition which reflects a network's community structure. Using a maximum
likelihood solution for the network inference leads to a least-squares problem.
By solving this problem, we are able to present an efficient algorithm for
transforming the network to a new space which is both concise and
discriminative. This new space preserves the identity of the network as much as
possible. Our algorithm is interpretable and intuitive. Finally, by comparing
our research against the baseline method (SVD) and against a state-of-the-art
Graphlet algorithm, we show the strength of our algorithm in discriminating
between different categories of networks.

they exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. Parametrizing this as a
vertical gradient returns approximately 4 Gyr/kpc for the disc we probe,
although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. The ages of stars show
a smooth distribution over the last 10 Gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescent
evolution for the Milky Way disc since a redshift of about 2. We also find a
flat age-metallicity relation for disc stars. Finally, we show how to use
secondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread,

transport in well-controlled systems. In this work we study how to induce
long-range transfer between the two ends of a dimer chain, by coupling states
that are localized just on the chain's end-points. This has the appealing
feature that the transfer occurs only between the end-points -- the particle
does not pass through the intermediate sites -- making the transfer less

states of the familiar Shockley or Tamm type can be used to produce a similar
form of transfer under the action of a periodic driving potential. Finally we
show that combining these effects can produce transfer by means of more exotic
topological effects, in which the driving field can be used to switch the
topological character of the edge states, as measured by the Zak phase. Our
results demonstrate how to induce long range transfer of strongly correlated

physics is rapidly boosting the field, and the possibility of synthetizing
multiple strange hypernuclei requires the addition of the strangeness degree of
freedom to the models dedicated to nuclear structure and nuclear matter studies
at low energy.
  Purpose: We want to settle the influence of strangeness on the nuclear
liquid-gas phase transition. Because of the large uncertainties concerning the
hyperon sector, we do not aim at a quantitative estimation of the phase diagram
but rather at a qualitative description of the phenomenology, as model
independent as possible.
  Method: We analyze the phase diagram of low density matter composed of
neutrons, protons and $\Lambda$ hyperons using a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)
model. We largely explore the parameter space to pin down generic features of
the phase transition, and compare the results to ab-initio quantum Monte Carlo
calculations.
  Results: We show that the liquid-gas phase transition is only slightly
quenched by the addition of hyperons. Strangeness is seen to be an order
parameter of the phase transition, meaning that dilute strange matter is
expected to be unstable with respect to the formation of hyper-clusters.
  Conclusions: More quantitative results within the RMF model need improved
functionals at low density, possibly fitted to ab-initio calculations of
nuclear and $\Lambda$ matter.

by external voltage, is described by the standard depinning theory of elastic
media in disordered pinning potentials. We numerically study the regimes that
are of relevance for quantum-phase-slip ladders. These are (i) very short

regime where the depinning voltage does not depend on the decay length of the
repulsive interaction. In the regime of weak disorder we find an emergent

excessive interference originating from a plethora of geographically

interference alignment (IA) are conceived. The first, termed the full-IA,
avoids all intra-cell interference (ICI) and other-cell interference by finding
the perfect interference-nulling receive beamforming matrices (RxBFMs). The
second protocol, termed partial-IA, only attempts to null the ICI. Employing
the RxBFMs computed by either of these protocols mathematically decomposes the
channel into a multiplicity of non-interfering multiple-input--single-output
channels, which we term as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). The problem
of finding the optimal SMCs as well as their power control variables for the
ESEM problem considered is formally defined and converted into a convex
optimization form with carefully selected variable relaxations and
transformations. Thus, the optimal SMCs and power control variables can be
distributively computed using both the classic dual decomposition and
subgradient methods. Our results indicate that indeed, the ESEM algorithm
performs better than the baseline equal power allocation algorithm in terms of
its ESE. Furthermore, surprisingly the partial-IA outperforms the full-IA in
all cases considered, which is because the partial-IA is less restrictive in
terms of the number of available transmit dimensions at the transmitters. Given
the typical cell sizes considered in this paper, the path-loss sufficiently
attenuates the majority of the interference, and thus the full-IA
over-compensates, when trying to avoid all possible sources of interference.

of unconventional superconductors, one has in these systems the possibility to
tune the interactions by small changes in pressure, doping or disorder. Thus,
measurements of order parameter evolution with these parameters should enable a
deeper understanding of the underlying interactions. I briefly review the
""standard paradigm"" for $s$-wave pairing in these systems, and then focus on
developments in the past several years which have challenged this picture. I
discuss the reasons for the apparent close competition between pairing in s-
and d-wave channels, particularly in those systems where one type of Fermi
surface pocket -- hole or electron -- is missing. Observation of a transition
between $s$- and $d$-wave symmetry, possibly via a time reversal symmetry
breaking ""$s+id$"" state, would provide an importantconfirmation of these ideas.
Several proposals for detecting these novel phases are discussed, including the
appearance of order parameter collective modes in Raman and optical
conductivities. Transitions between two different types of $s$-wave states,
involving various combinations of signs on Fermi surface pockets, can also
proceed through a ${\cal T}$-breaking ""$s+is$"" state. I discuss recent work
that suggests pairing may take place away from the Fermi level over a
surprisingly large energy range, as well as the effect of glide plane symmetry
of the Fe-based systems on the superconductivity, including various exotic,
time and translational invariance breaking pair states that have been proposed.
Finally, I address disorder issues, and the various ways systematic
introduction of disorder can (and cannot) be used to extract information on gap
symmetry and structure.

fluctuations beyond RPA in the multi-orbital Hubbard model, we derive its
nematic susceptibility and contrast it with its ferro-orbital order
susceptibility, showing that its leading instability is the spin-driven nematic
phase. Our results also demonstrate the primary role played by the $d_{xy}$
orbital in driving the nematic transition, and reveal that high-energy magnetic
fluctuations are essential to stabilize nematic order in the absence of
magnetic order.

doesn't involve subtractions. Algebraic expressions for the special cases of
one, two, three and four states are derived. A consequence of the procedure is
that the stationary distribution of the embedded Markov chain does not need to

from young stellar objects at all stages of their evolution. In particular,
lateral entrainment of ambient material by high-velocity, well-collimated
protostellar jets may be the cause of the multiple emission-line velocity
components observed in the microjet-scale outflows driven by classical T Tauri
stars. Intermediate-velocity outflow components may be emitted by a turbulent,
shock- excited mixing layer along the boundaries of the jet. We present a
formalism for describing such a mixing layer based on Reynolds decomposition of
quantities measuring fundamental properties of the gas. In this model, the
molecular wind from large disc radii provides a continual supply of material
for entrainment. We calculate the total stress profile in the mixing layer,
which allows us to estimate the dissipation of turbulent energy, and hence the
luminosity of the layer. We utilize MAPPINGS IV shock models to determine the
fraction of total emission that occurs in [Fe II] 1.644 {\mu}m line emission in
order to facilitate comparison to previous observations of the young stellar
object DG Tauri. Our model accurately estimates the luminosity and changes in
mass outflow rate of the intermediate-velocity component of the DG Tau
approaching outflow. Therefore, we propose that this component represents a
turbulent mixing layer surrounding the well-collimated jet in this object.
Finally, we compare and contrast our model to previous work in the field.

simulations of the evolution of primordial protostars, their immediate
environment, and the dynamic accretion history under the influence of stellar
ionizing and dissociating UV feedback. Our coupled SE-RHD calculations result
in a wide diversity of final stellar masses covering 10 Msun $\lesssim M_*
\lesssim$ 1000 Msun. The formation of very massive ($\gtrsim$ 250 Msun) stars
is possible under weak UV feedback, whereas ordinary massive (a few x 10 Msun)
stars form when UV feedback can efficiently halt the accretion. This may
explain the peculiar abundance pattern of a Galactic metal-poor star recently
reported by Aoki et al. (2014), possibly the observational signature of very
massive precursor primordial stars. Weak UV feedback occurs in cases of
variable accretion, in particular when repeated short accretion bursts
temporarily exceed 0.01 Msun/yr, causing the protostar to inflate. In the
bloated state, the protostar has low surface temperature and UV feedback is
suppressed until the star eventually contracts, on a thermal adjustment
timescale, to create an HII region. If the delay time between successive
accretion bursts is sufficiently short, the protostar remains bloated for
extended periods, initiating at most only short periods of UV feedback. Disk
fragmentation does not necessarily reduce the final stellar mass. Quite the
contrary, we find that disk fragmentation enhances episodic accretion as many
fragments migrate inward and are accreted onto the star, thus allowing
continued stellar mass growth under conditions of intermittent UV feedback.
This trend becomes more prominent as we improve the resolution of our
simulations. We argue that simulations with significantly higher resolution
than reported previously are needed to derive accurate gas mass accretion rates
onto primordial protostars.

extensive monitoring program in X-rays (a temporal baseline of 4.2 yr), making
it one of the most suitable candidates to study the long-timescale
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
  Aims. Previous timing analysis of the Swift data of NGC 5408 X-1 led to
detection of multiple periodicities ranging from 2.6 d to 230 d. In this paper,
we focus on the statistical significance and the temporal evolution of these
periodicities.
  Methods. A time-series analysis technique in the time-frequency domain, the
weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), was employed to identify the periodicities
and trace their variations with time.
  Results. Three periodic components were detected from the WWZ periodogram,
corresponding to periods of 2.65$\pm$0.01 d, 115.4$\pm$14.4 d and
189.1$\pm$15.2 d. All three have statistical significance higher than 99.74%.
The 2.65-d periodicity is quite stable in the majority of the light curve. The
115-d periodicity is the most prominent but appears variable. The 189-d
periodicity is persistent across the whole time coverage. It shows a steadily
decreasing trend from the beginning (193 d period) to the end (181 d period).
  Conclusions. The long-timescale periodicities in NGC 5408 X-1 are most likely
of super-orbital origin, and are probably associated with the precession of a
warped accretion disc. The disc may have been broken into two distinct planes
with different precessing periods, i.e. the 189-d and 115-d periodicities
corresponding to the outer and inner disc, respectively.

the GRB X-ray plateaus are powered by the rotational energy of a newly formed
magnetar, the current observational properties of the Galactic magnetar
population are not compatible with being formed within the GRB scenario
(regardless of the GRB type or rate at z=0). Direct consequences would be that
we should allow the existence of magnetars and ""super-magnetars"" having
different progenitors, and that Type Ib/c SNe related to Long GRBs form
systematically neutron stars with higher initial magnetic fields. We put an
upper limit of <16 ""super-magnetars"" formed by a GRB in our Galaxy in the past
Myr (at 99% c.l.). This limit is somewhat smaller than what roughly expected
from Long GRB rates, although the very large uncertainties do not allow us to

  Keywords : capacity achieving codes, polar codes, reed muller codes",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transmission of information reliably and efficiently across channels is one
of the fundamental goals of coding and information theory. In this respect,
efficiently decodable deterministic coding schemes which achieve capacity
provably have been elusive until as recent as 2008, even though schemes which
come close to it in practice existed. This survey tries to give the interested
reader an overview of the area.
  Erdal Arikan came up with his landmark polar coding shemes which achieve
capacity on symmetric channels subject to the constraint that the input
codewords are equiprobable. His idea is to convert any B-DMC into efficiently
encodable-decodable channels which have rates 0 and 1, while conserving
capacity in this transformation. An exponentially decreasing probability of
error which independent of code rate is achieved for all rates lesser than the
symmetric capacity. These codes perform well in practice since encoding and
decoding complexity is O(N log N). Guruswami et al. improved the above results
by showing that error probability can be made to decrease doubly exponentially
in the block length.
  We also study recent results by Urbanke et al. which show that 2-transitive
codes also achieve capacity on erasure channels under MAP decoding. Urbanke and
his group use complexity theoretic results in boolean function analysis to
prove that EXIT functions, which capture the error probability, have a sharp
threshold at 1-R, thus proving that capacity is achieved. One of the oldest and
most widely used codes - Reed Muller codes are 2-transitive. Polar codes are
2-transitive too and we thus have a different proof of the fact that they
achieve capacity, though the rate of polarization would be better as found out
by Guruswami.

fine-tuning to aggregate similar objects and parts into groups, called meta
objects. A scene image representation is constructed by pooling the feature
response maps of all the learned meta objects at multiple spatial scales. We
have confirmed that the scene image representation obtained using this new

magnetometry technique. On one hand, surface magnetization behaves
independently of the CFO thickness and does not saturate up to high fields,
evidencing that the surface has its own anisotropy. On the other hand,
characteristic zero-field magnetization steps are not present at the surface
while they are relevant in the bulk, strongly suggesting that antiphase
boundaries are the responsible of such intriguing features. In addition, a
contribution from ordinary magnetoresistance of Pt is identified, which is only
distinguishable due to the low resistivity of the $\textit{in-situ}$ grown Pt.

adjustment of the relaxation parameters of various iterative algorithms for
X-ray CT reconstruction relying on sparsity priors. Sparsity prior has been
found to be an efficient strategy in CT reconstruction where significantly
fewer attenuation measurements are available. Sparsity prior CT reconstruction
relies on iterative algorithms such as the algebraic reconstruction technique
(ART) to produce a crude reconstruction based on which a sparse approximation
is performed. Data driven adjustment of relaxation has been found to ensure
better convergence than traditional relaxation for ART. In this paper, we study
the performance of such data driven relaxation on a (CS) compressed sensing
environment. State-of-the-art algorithms are implemented and their performance
analyzed in regard to conventional and data-driven relaxation. Experiments are
performed both on simulated and real environments. For the simulated case,
experiments are conducted with and without the presence of noise. Correlation
coefficients, root mean square error, structural similarity index and
perceptual dissimilarity metric were used for the quantitative comparisons of
the results. Experiments reveal that data driven relaxation also ensures
overall better quality reconstruction in a CS environment compared to
traditional relaxation. However, when the data are corrupted by noise,
inconsistencies emerge in the convergence unless a threshold is imposed on the
maximum amendments. Data driven relaxation seems a logical choice to more
rapidly reach the solution. In a compressed sensing environment, especially
when the data are corrupted by noise, a threshold to specify the maximum
amendments needs to be specified. Experimentally, we have set the threshold as
20% of the previous value and thus have ensured more consistency in the
convergence.

determine the degree of correlation between the occurrence of O2 and HOOH

HOOH in the rho Ophiuchi cloud (core A), we now search for HOOH in Orion
Molecular Cloud OMC A, where O2 has also been detected. Methods: We mapped a 3
arcmin times 3 arcmin region around Orion H2-Peak 1 with the Atacama Pathfinder
Experiment (APEX). In addition to several maps in two transitions of HOOH, viz.
219.17 GHz and 251.91 GHz, we obtained single-point spectra for another three
transitions towards the position of maximum emission. Results: Line emission at
the appropriate LSR-velocity (Local Standard of Rest) and at the level of
greater or equal to 4 sigma was found for two transitions, with lower S/N (2.8
- 3.5 sigma) for another two transitions, whereas for the remaining transition,
only an upper limit was obtained. The emitting region, offset 18 arcsec south
of H2-Peak 1, appeared point-like in our observations with APEX. Conclusions:
The extremely high spectral line density in Orion makes the identification of
HOOH much more difficult than in rho Oph A. As a result of having to consider
the possible contamination by other molecules, we left the current detection
status undecided.

of dynamical instability. The dispersion relations reveal a complex crossing
and bifurcation scenario. For stationary structures we find that for
$\mu/\hbar\omega_\perp > 2.65$ the solitonic vortex is the only stable solitary

dark solitons and may be seen as transient structures in experiments. Fully
time-dependent simulations illustrate typical decay scenarios, which may result
in the generation of multiple separated solitonic vortices.

in a one-dimensional waveguide doped with a pair of ideal two-level systems for
three topical cases: classical driving, under the action of noise, and single
photon pulsed excitation. We show that even under the constant action of
unwanted noise the device still operates effectively as an optical isolator,
which is of critical importance for noise resistance. Finally, harnessing
stimulated emission allows for non-reciprocal behavior for single photon
inputs, thus showing purely quantum rectification at the single-photon level.
The latter is a considerable step towards the ultimate goal of devising an
unconditional quantum rectifier for arbitrary quantum states.

maps, and used synchrotron ageing models to determine the time elapsed from the
last time the source plasma was energized. We used LOFAR, Giant Metrewave Radio

analysis, we infer that the AGN that created this source currently has very low
levels of activity or that it is switched off. The derived ages for the larger
source component range from around 60 to 130 Myr, hinting that the AGN activity
decreased or stopped around 60 Myr ago. Our analysis suggests that VLSS
J1431.8+1331 is an intriguing, two-component source. The larger component seems
to host a faint radio core, suggesting that the source may be an AGN radio
relic. The spectral index we observe from the smaller component is distinctly
flatter at lower frequencies than the spectral index of the larger component,
suggesting the possibility that the smaller component may be a shocked plasma
bubble. From the integrated source spectrum, we deduce that its shape and slope
can be used as tracers of the activity history of this type of steep spectrum

in a periodic potential, are one of the most striking effects of coherent
quantum transport in the matter. In the semiclassical picture, it is well known
that BOs can be explained owing to the periodic band structure of the crystal
and the so-called 'acceleration' theorem: since in the momentum space the
particle wave packet drifts with a constant speed without being distorted, in
real space the probability distribution of the particle undergoes a periodic
motion following a trajectory which exactly reproduces the shape of the lattice
band. In non-Hermitian lattices with a complex (i.e. not real) energy band,
extension of the semiclassical model is not intuitive. Here we show that the
acceleration theorem holds for non-Hermitian lattices with a complex energy
band only {\it on average}, and that the periodic wave packet motion of the
particle in the real space is described by a trajectory in {\it complex} plane,
i.e. it generally corresponds to reshaping and breathing of the wave packet in
addition to a transverse oscillatory motion. The concept of BOs involving
complex trajectories is exemplified by considering two examples of
non-Hermitian lattices with a complex band dispersion relation, including the
Hatano-Nelson tight-binding Hamiltonian describing the hopping motion of a
quantum particle on a linear lattice with an imaginary vector potential and a
tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping rates.

transitions of water in nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE). We select
a sample of transitions in the mid- IR regime and the fundamental ortho and
para water transitions in the far-IR. We investigate the chemistry and the
local physical conditions in the line emitting regions. We calculate Spitzer
spectra for each model and compare far-IR and mid-IR lines. In addition, we use
mid-IR colors to tie the water line predictions to the dust continuum.
Parameters affecting the water line fluxes in disks by more than a factor of
three are : the disk gas mass, the dust-to-gas mass ratio, the dust maximum
grain size, ISM(InterStellarMedium) UV radiation field, the mixing parameter of
Dubrulle settling, the disk flaring parameter, and the dust size distribution.
The first four parameters affect the mid-IR lines much more than the far-IR
lines. A key driver behind water spectroscopy is the dust opacity, which sets
the location of the water line emitting region. We identify three types of
parameters. Parameters, such as dust-to-gas ratio, ISM radiation field, and
dust size distribution, affect the mid-IR lines more, while the far-IR
transitions are more affected by the flaring index. The gas mass greatly
affects lines in both regimes. Higher spectral resolution and line
sensitivities, like from the James Webb Space Telescope, are needed to detect a
statistically relevant sample of individual water lines to distinguish further
between these types of parameters.

the factorization. As a result, estimation of a sub-network is possible without

task-independent objective functions is an important prerequisite for objective
comparisons of algorithms and movements of animals. The temporal sequence of
such a behavior can be considered as a time series and hence complexity
measures developed for time series are natural candidates for its
quantification. The predictive information and the excess entropy are such
complexity measures. They measure the amount of information the past contains
about the future and thus quantify the nonrandom structure in the temporal
sequence. However, when using these measures for systems with continuous states
one has to deal with the fact that their values will depend on the resolution
with which the systems states are observed. For deterministic systems both
measures will diverge with increasing resolution. We therefore propose a new
decomposition of the excess entropy in resolution dependent and resolution
independent parts and discuss how they depend on the dimensionality of the
dynamics, correlations and the noise level. For the practical estimation we
propose to use estimates based on the correlation integral instead of the
direct estimation of the mutual information using the algorithm by Kraskov et
al. (2004) which is based on next neighbor statistics because the latter allows
less control of the scale dependencies. Using our algorithm we are able to show
how autonomous learning generates behavior of increasing complexity with
increasing learning duration.

of a population of dust particles, treated as Lagrangian particles, in
two-dimensional, locally isothermal disks where two equal mass planets are
present. The planets are kept in fixed orbits and they do not accrete mass. The
outer planet plays a major role removing the dust particles in the co-orbital
region of the inner planet and forming a particle ring which promotes the
development of vortices respect to the single planetary case. The ring and gaps
width depends strongly on the planetary mass and particle stopping times, and
for the more massive cases the ring clumps in few stable points that are able
to collect a high mass fraction. The features observed in the HL Tau system can
be explained through the presence of several massive cores that shape the dust
disk, where the inner planet(s) should have a mass on the order of 0.07 Jupiter
masses and the outer one(s) on the order of 0.35 Jupiter masses. These values
can be significantly lower if the disk mass turns out to be less than
previously estimated. Decreasing the disk mass by a factor 10 we obtain similar
gap widths for planets with a mass of 10 and 20 Earth masses respectively.
Although the particle gaps are prominent, the expected gaseous gaps would be
barely visible.

that, in contrast to previous studies, neither strong neutrino cooling nor
strong heating occurs in this layer. We conclude that Urca cooling in the outer
crusts of accreting neutron stars that exhibit superbursts or high temperature

considerably weaker than predicted. Urca cooling must instead be dominated by
electron capture on the small amounts of adjacent odd-A nuclei contained in the

the absence of strong crust Urca cooling inferred from the observed cooling

physical properties of galaxies forming in the early universe, probing the dust
reddening, age, metal content, and even the escape fraction. While constraints
on these slopes generally become more challenging at higher redshifts as the UV
continuum shifts out of the Hubble Space Telescope bands (particularly at z>7),
such a characterisation actually becomes abruptly easier for galaxies in the
redshift window z=9.5-10.5 due to the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6um-band probing the
rest-UV continuum and the long wavelength baseline between this Spitzer band
and the Hubble H-band. Higher S/N constraints on the UV slope are possible at
z~10 than at z=8. Here we take advantage of this opportunity and five recently
discovered bright z=9.5-10.5 galaxies to present the first measurements of the
mean slope for a multi-object sample of galaxy candidates at z~10. We find the
measured observed slopes of these candidates are $-2.1\pm0.3\pm0.2$ (random and
systematic), only slightly bluer than the measured slopes at 3.5<z<7.5 for
galaxies of similar luminosities. Small increases in the stellar ages,
metallicities, and dust content of the galaxy population from z~10 to z~7 could
easily explain the apparent evolution in slopes.

properties of hypergraphs with respect to edge expansion. In particular, a
diffusion process is defined on a hypergraph such that within each hyperedge,
measure flows from nodes having maximum weighted measure to those having
minimum. The diffusion process determines a Laplacian, whose spectral
properties are related to the edge expansion properties of the hypergraph.
  It is suggested that in the above diffusion process, within each hyperedge,
measure should flow uniformly in the complete bipartite graph from nodes with
maximum weighted measure to those with minimum. However, we discover that this
method has some technical issues. First, the diffusion process would not be
well-defined. Second, the resulting Laplacian would not have the claimed
spectral properties.
  In this paper, we show that the measure flow between the above two sets of
nodes must be coordinated carefully over different hyperedges in order for the
diffusion process to be well-defined, from which a Laplacian can be uniquely
determined. Since the Laplacian is non-linear, we have to exploit other
properties of the diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning
the ""second eigenvalue"" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that
higher order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current
framework.

to exhibit some exotic behaviors; one of their curious features is the
existence of two types of vortices (each vortex has vorticity either parallel

antiparallel vortices against nonmagnetic Born-like impurities. In this work,
we study the impurity effect on the vortex of the chiral $p$-wave
superconductors through the quasiclassical Green's function formalism. We take
account of impurities via the self-consistent $t$-matrix approximation so that
we can deal with strong as well as Born-like (i.e., weak) scatterers. We found
that the spectrum is heavily broadened when the phase shift $\delta_0$ of each
impurity exceeds a critical value $\delta_{\text{c}}$ above which the impurity
band emerges at the Fermi level. We also found a quantitative difference in the
impurity effects on the two types of vortex for $\delta_0<\delta_{\text{c}}$.
Part of the numerical results for $\delta_0<\delta_{\text{c}}$ can be
understood by a variant of the analytical theory of Kramer and Pesch for bound

in algebraic system and in linear algebra help us to understand the structure

of its set of relations. In this paper we mainly deal with graded augmented
algebras. Given a graded augmented algebra with its generators and relations,
it is possible to construct a free resolution from its $Gr\""obner$ basis, known
as Anick's resolution. Though rarely minimal, this resolution helps us to
understand combinatorial properties of the algebra. The notion of a $K_2$
algebra was recently introduced by Cassidy and Shelton as a generalization of
the notion of a Koszul algebra. We compute the Anick's resolution of $K_2$
algebra which shows several nice combinatorial properties. Later we compute
some derived functors from Anick's resolution and outline how to construct
$A_\infty$-algebra structure on $Ext$-algebra from a minimal graded projective
resolution in which we can use Anick's resolution as a tool. Thus this paper
provides an unique platform to connect concepts of linear algebra with
homological algebra and homotopical algebra with the help of $Gr\""obner$ bases.

devising effective baseband compression strategies for transmission on the
fronthaul links connecting a remote radio head (RRH) to the managing central
unit (CU). Most theoretical works on the subject implicitly assume that the
RRHs, and hence the CU, are able to perfectly recover time synchronization from
the baseband signals received in the uplink, and focus on the compression of
the data fields. This paper instead dose not assume a priori synchronization of
RRHs and CU, and considers the problem of fronthaul compression design at the
RRHs with the aim of enhancing the performance of time and phase
synchronization at the CU. The problem is tackled by analyzing the impact of
the synchronization error on the performance of the link and by adopting
information and estimationtheoretic performance metrics such as the
rate-distortion function and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). The proposed algorithm
is based on the Charnes-Cooper transformation and on the Difference of Convex

aggregate into bundles when the charge density of the polymers exceeds a
critical value that depends on the valency of the counterions. The dynamics of

depends on the value of the charge density of the polymers. For values close to
the critical value, the shape of the aggregates is cylindrical with height
equal to the length of a single polyelectrolyte chain. However, for larger
values of charge, the linear extent of the aggregates increases as more and
more polymers aggregate.In both the cases, we show that the number of
aggregates decrease with time as power laws with exponents that are not
numerically distinguishable from each other, and are independent of charge
density of the polymers, valency of the counterions, density, and length of the

running time of our algorithm implies that $\alpha$-SimFVS is FPT even when
$\alpha \in o(\log n)$. We complement this positive result by showing that for

perturbativity up to a very high scale, and it was believed that the MDM model
with a real scalar septuplet could keep perturbative up to the Planck or GUT
scale. In this work we point out that it is not true after taking into account
the running of the quartic self-couplings of the scalar septuplet. For the
septuplet mass around $10$ TeV, which is suggested by the observed dark matter
relic abundance, these couplings would hit the Landau pole at a scale $\sim
10^8-10^9$ GeV, much lower than the Planck scale. We attempt to push up the
Landau pole scale as high as possible by proposing an extension with extra
Yukawa interactions of the septuplet. We find that in principle the Landau pole
could be deferred to a scale of $\sim 10^{14}$ GeV if one could tolerate a
serious fine-tuning of the initial condition of the Yukawa coupling. Moreover,
if the MDM particle mass could be relaxed to $\sim10^8$ GeV, which would need
some nonthermal production mechanisms to give a correct relic abundance, the
Landau pole scale could be pushed up above the Planck scale.

simulations, a completely accurate description of the domain in terms of a
computational mesh is frequently deemed infeasible. Shoreline and bathymetry
simplification methods are used to remove small scale details in the geometry,
particularly in areas away from the region of interest. To that end, a novel
method for shoreline and bathymetry simplification is presented. Existing
shoreline simplification methods typically remove points if the resultant
geometry satisfies particular geometric criteria. Bathymetry is usually
simplified using traditional filtering techniques, that remove unwanted Fourier
modes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used in other fields to
isolate small-scale structures from larger scale coherent features in a robust
way, underpinned by a rigorous but simple mathematical framework. Here we
present a method based on principal component analysis aimed towards
simplification of shorelines and bathymetry. We present the algorithm in detail
and show simplified shorelines and bathymetry in the wider region around the
North Sea. Finally, the methods are used in the context of unstructured mesh
generation aimed at tidal resource assessment simulations in the coastal
regions around the UK.

installed at 3500m depth 80km offshore the Italian coast. KM3NeT in its final
configuration will contain several hundreds of detection units. Each detection
unit is a mechanical structure anchored to the sea floor, held vertical by a
submerged buoy and supporting optical modules for the detection of Cherenkov
light emitted by charged secondary particles emerging from neutrino
interactions. This prototype string implements three optical modules with 31
photomultiplier tubes each. These optical modules were developed by the KM3NeT
Collaboration to enhance the detection capability of neutrino interactions. The
prototype detection unit was operated since its deployment in May 2014 until
its decommissioning in July 2015. Reconstruction of the particle trajectories
from the data requires a nanosecond accuracy in the time calibration. A
procedure for relative time calibration of the photomultiplier tubes contained
in each optical module is described. This procedure is based on the measured
coincidences produced in the sea by the 40K background light and can easily be
expanded to a detector with several thousands of optical modules. The time
offsets between the different optical modules are obtained using LED
nanobeacons mounted inside them. A set of data corresponding to 600 hours of
livetime was analysed. The results show good agreement with Monte Carlo
simulations of the expected optical background and the signal from atmospheric
muons. An almost background-free sample of muons was selected by filtering the
time correlated signals on all the three optical modules. The zenith angle of
the selected muons was reconstructed with a precision of about 3{\deg}.

vocabulary mismatch and term dependencies. Vocabulary mismatch corresponds to
the difficulty of retrieving relevant documents that do not contain exact query
terms but semantically related terms. Term dependencies refers to the need of
considering the relationship between the words of the query when estimating the
relevance of a document. A multitude of solutions has been proposed to solve
each of these two problems, but no principled model solve both. In parallel, in
the last few years, language models based on neural networks have been used to
cope with complex natural language processing tasks like emotion and paraphrase
detection. Although they present good abilities to cope with both term
dependencies and vocabulary mismatch problems, thanks to the distributed
representation of words they are based upon, such models could not be used
readily in IR, where the estimation of one language model per document (or
query) is required. This is both computationally unfeasible and prone to
over-fitting. Based on a recent work that proposed to learn a generic language
model that can be modified through a set of document-specific parameters, we
explore use of new neural network models that are adapted to ad-hoc IR tasks.
Within the language model IR framework, we propose and study the use of a
generic language model as well as a document-specific language model. Both can
be used as a smoothing component, but the latter is more adapted to the
document at hand and has the potential of being used as a full document
language model. We experiment with such models and analyze their results on
TREC-1 to 8 datasets.

67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014. Philae carries the Dust Impact
Monitor (DIM) on board, which is part of the Surface Electric Sounding and
Acoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME). DIM employs piezoelectric PZT sensors
to detect impacts by sub-millimeter and millimeter-sized ice and dust particles
that are emitted from the nucleus and transported into the cometary coma. The
DIM sensor measures dynamical data like flux and the directionality of the
impacting particles. Mass and speed of the particles can be constrained
assuming density and elastic particle properties. DIM was operated during three
mission phases of Philae at the comet: (1) Before Philae's separation from
Rosetta at distances of about 9.6 km, 11.8 km, and 25.3 km from the nucleus
barycenter. In this mission phase particles released from the nucleus on radial
trajectories remained undetectable because of significant obscuration by the
structures of Rosetta, and no dust particles were indeed detected. (2) During
Philae's descent to its nominal landing site Agilkia, DIM detected one
approximately millimeter-sized particle at a distance of 5.0 km from the
nucleus' barycenter, corresponding to an altitude of 2.4 km from the surface.
This is the closest ever dust detection at a cometary nucleus by a dedicated
in-situ dust detector. (3) At Philae's final landing site, Abydos, DIM detected
no dust impact which may be due to low cometary activity in the vicinity of
Philae, or due to shading by obstacles close to Philae, or both. Laboratory
calibration experiments showed that the material properties of the detected
particle are compatible with a porous particle having a bulk density of
approximately $250\, \mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}$. The particle could have been lifted
off from the comet's surface by sublimating water ice.

Duffing oscillators where only the first oscillator is driven by a periodic
force, assuming a nearest neighbour coupling. We have derived the
frequency-response equations for a system composed of two-coupled oscillators
by using a theoretical approach. Interestingly, the frequency-response curve
displays two resonance peaks and one anti-resonance. A theoretical prediction
of the response amplitudes of two oscillators closely match with the
numerically computed amplitudes. We analyse the effect of the coupling strength
on the resonance and anti-resonance frequencies and the response amplitudes at
these frequencies. For the n-coupled oscillators system, in general, there are
n-resonant peaks and (n-1) anti-resonant peaks. For large values of n, except
for the first resonance, other resonant peaks are weak due to linear damping.
The resonance behaviours observed in the n-coupled Duffing oscillators are also
realized in an electronic analog circuit simulation of the equations.
Understanding the role of coupling and system size has the potential
applications in music, structural engineering, power systems, biological
networks, electrical and electronic systems.

profile is logarithmic only in these regions and not in the rest of the
boundary layer where it is sheared by the large scale wind and impacted by
plumes. In addition, the logarithmic behavior is not visible in the horizontal
average. The findings reveal that the temperature profiles are strongly
connected to thermal plume emission and support a perception that parts of the
boundary layer can be turbulent, while others are not. The transition to the
ultimate regime, in which the boundary layers are considered to be fully
turbulent, can therefore be understood as a gradual increases in fraction of
the plume-emitting ('turbulent') regions of the boundary layer.

fluorine adatoms covalently bond to the top graphene layer. We show that
fluorine adatoms give rise to resonant impurity states near the charge
neutrality point of the bilayer, leading to strong scattering of charge
carriers and hopping conduction inside a field-induced band gap. Remarkably,
the application of an electric field across the layers is shown to tune the
resonant scattering amplitude from fluorine adatoms by nearly twofold. The
experimental observations are well explained by a theoretical analysis
combining Boltzmann transport equations and fully quantum-mechanical methods.
This paradigm can be generalized to many bilayer graphene-adatom materials, and

and they assume diffusion within a single layer using knowledge representation.
From the organizational perspective connecting several types of knowledge and
modelling changes of competence can bring additional value. In the article we
extended existing approaches by using multilayer diffusion model and focused on
analysis of competence development process. The proposed model describes
competence development process in a new way through horizontal and vertical
knowledge diffusion in multilayer network. In the network, agents collaborate
and interchange various kind of knowledge through different layers and this
mutual activities affect the competences in a positive or negative way. Taking
under consideration workers cognitive and social abilities and the previous

conditions require the axial and azimuthal components of the mean velocity take
the shapes of the zeroth and first order Bessel functions of the first kind,

excellent agreement is found between theory and numerical results. Large scale

detected in emission in the Planck all-sky survey that corresponds to two
over-densities of high-redshift galaxies. This is the first source from the
Planck catalogue of high-z candidates that has been completely characterised
with follow-up observations from the optical to the sub-millimetre domain.
Herschel/SPIRE observations at 250, 350 and 500 microns reveal the existence of
five sources producing a 500 microns emission excess that spatially corresponds
to the candidate proto-clusters discovered by Planck. Further observations at
CFHT in the optical bands (g and i) and in the near infrared (J, H and K_s),
plus mid infrared observations with IRAC/Spitzer (at 3.6 and 4.5 microns)
confirm that the sub-mm red excess is associated with an over-density of
colour-selected galaxies. Follow-up spectroscopy of 13 galaxies with
VLT/X-Shooter establishes the existence of two high-z structures: one at z~1.7
(three confirmed member galaxies), the other at z~2.0 (six confirmed members).
This double structure is also seen in the photometric redshift analysis of a
sample of 127 galaxies located inside a circular region of 1'-radius containing
the five Herschel/SPIRE sources, where we found a double-peaked excess of
galaxies at z~1.7 and z~2.0 with respect to the surrounding region. These
results suggest that PHz G95.5-61.6 corresponds to two accreting nodes, not
physically linked to one another, embedded in the large scale structure of the
Universe at z~2 and along the same line-of-sight. In conclusion, the data,
methods and results illustrated in this pilot project confirm that Planck data
can be used to detect the emission from clustered, dusty star forming galaxies
at high-z, and, thus, to pierce through the early growth of cluster-scale
structures.

subhaloes in their host haloes. Using numerical simulations, we examine the
segregation of twelve different subhalo properties with respect to both orbital
energy and halo-centric radius (in real space as well as in projection).
Subhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome of
the inside-out assembly of their host haloes. Since subhaloes that were
accreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that have
lost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits.
Subhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circular
velocities at accretion. We demonstrate that part of this segregation is
already imprinted in the infall conditions. For massive subhaloes it is
subsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radial
orbit. The impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the fact
that subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. Because of
tidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day mass
or maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloes
on more bound orbits to have smaller spin. There is a weak tendency for
subhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the center of their host
halo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formation
time is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties. We discuss the
implications of our results for the segregation of satellite galaxies in galaxy
groups and clusters.

scales for samples with different Mn contents (x=0.01-0.11). As to the
oscillatory MO profiles observed in the long time scale, simulation based on
the LLG equation combined with two different MO effects confirms
photo-inducement of the perpendicular anisotropy component p-Heff. As for the
profiles observed in the ultra-short time scale, they are consistently
explained in terms of the dynamics of photo-generated carriers, but not by the
sudden reduction in magnetization. With those experimental results and
analyses, new mechanism which accounts for the photo-induced p-Heff is
addressed; photo-ionization like excitation of Mn(II). Namely, Mn(II) is
excited into Mn(III) and e . It is discussed that such excitation tips magnetic
anisotropy toward the out-of-plane direction through the inducement of orbital
angular momentum and the gradient dMn(II*)/dz. Validity of the proposed
mechanism is examined by estimating the efficiency of excitation on the basis
of the Lambert-Beer law and the experimental p-Heff values, through which the
efficiency of 1-10 ppm with the nominal optical cross section of around 5 x

of NISQ processors without the overhead required by full error correction.
Quantum information processing is especially challenging within the gate model,
as algorithms quickly lose fidelity as the problem size and circuit depth grow.
This has lead to a number of non-gate-model approaches such as analog quantum
simulation and quantum annealing. These approaches come with specific hardware
requirements that are typically different than that of a universal gate-based
quantum computer. We have previously proposed a non-gate-model approach called
the single-excitation subspace (SES) method, which requires a complete graph of
superconducting qubits. Like any approach lacking error correction, the SES
method is not scalable, but it often leads to algorithms with constant depth,
allowing it to outperform the gate model in a wide variety of applications. A
challenge of the SES method is that it requires a physical qubit for every
basis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes large resource costs
for algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla would
double the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling by
leaving the SES and reintroducing a tensor product structure in the
computational subspace. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SES
register holding ``data"" with one or more ancilla qubits. This enables a hybrid
form of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on the
data, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas,
and controlled-unitaries act between. As an application we give an SES
implementation of the quantum linear system solver of Harrow, Hassidim, and
Lloyd.

applicable to SDP relaxations of general polynomial programs, we apply it to
two problems of discrete optimization: the maximum independent set problem and
the partition problem. We further show that some completely trivial instances

difficult combinatorial search problems. A fundamental task in answer set
programming is to compute stable models, i.e., solutions of logic programs.
Answer set solvers are the programs that perform this task. The problem of
deciding whether a disjunctive program has a stable model is
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete. The high complexity of reasoning within disjunctive
logic programming is responsible for few solvers capable of dealing with such
programs, namely DLV, GnT, Cmodels, CLASP and WASP. In this paper we show that
transition systems introduced by Nieuwenhuis, Oliveras, and Tinelli to model
and analyze satisfiability solvers can be adapted for disjunctive answer set
solvers. Transition systems give a unifying perspective and bring clarity in
the description and comparison of solvers. They can be effectively used for
analyzing, comparing and proving correctness of search algorithms as well as
inspiring new ideas in the design of disjunctive answer set solvers. In this
light, we introduce a general template, which accounts for major techniques
implemented in disjunctive solvers. We then illustrate how this general
template captures solvers DLV, GnT and Cmodels. We also show how this framework
provides a convenient tool for designing new solving algorithms by means of
combinations of techniques employed in different solvers.

(w = curl v). Viscosity and resistivity are dissipative regularizations. We
propose a minimal, local, conservative, nonlinear, dispersive regularization of
compressible flow and ideal MHD, in analogy with the KdV regularization of the
1D Hopf equation. This work significantly extends earlier work on
incompressible Euler and ideal MHD. It involves a cut-off lambda inversely
proportional to square-root of density rho, which is like a position-dependent
mean free path. In MHD, lambda can be taken of order the electron collisionless
skin depth. The regularizing `twirl' term is - lambda w x curl w. Such a term
could be important in high speed flows with vorticity and arise in an expansion
of kinetic equations in Knudsen number. A magnetic analogue of the twirl term -
(B x curl B)/(rho mu_0), arises as the Lorentz force in ideal MHD. Our
regularization preserves symmetries of the ideal systems, and with appropriate
boundary conditions, implies associated conservation laws. Energy and enstrophy
are subject to a priori bounds determined by initial data. A Hamiltonian and
Poisson bracket formulation is developed and used to generalize the
constitutive relation to bound higher moments of w and curl w. A `swirl'
velocity field is shown to transport w/rho and B/rho, generalizing the
Kelvin-Helmholtz and Alfv\'en theorems. The steady regularized equations are
used to model a rotating vortex, MHD pinch, plane vortex sheet, channel flow,
plane flow and propagating spherical and cylindrical vortices; solutions are
more regular than corresponding Eulerian ones. The proposed regularization
could facilitate simulations of fluid/MHD equations and provide a consistent
statistical mechanics of vortices/current filaments in 3D, without blowup of
enstrophy. Implications for detailed analyses of fluid and plasma systems are
discussed.

to the wall with a tip angle of $90^\circ$. Results are compared to the smooth

the boundary layer thickness, the torque is the same as that of the smooth wall
cases. With increasing $Ta$, the boundary layer thickness becomes smaller than
the groove height. Plumes are ejected from the tips of the grooves and
secondary circulations between the latter are formed. This is associated to a
sharp increase of the torque and thus the effective scaling law for the torque
vs. $Ta$ becomes much steeper. Further increasing $Ta$ does not result in an
additional slope increase. Instead, the effective scaling law saturates to the
""ultimate"" regime effective exponents seen for smooth walls. It is found that
even though after saturation the slope is the same as for the smooth wall case,
the absolute value of torque is increased, and the more the larger size of the

localized impurity located either on the surface of the material or within the

numerically and analytically, regardless of the impurity magnitude, which
enables the description of realistic scatters. In rhombohedral multilayer
graphene, the impurity induces Friedel oscillations that always decay as $1/r$.
As a result, monolayer graphene is the only material of the rhombohedral class
that exhibits $1/r^{2}$-decaying Friedel oscillations. The interference
patterns are subsequently analyzed in momentum space. This analysis enables a
clear distinction between monolayer graphene and multilayer graphene. It also
shows that the interference pattern reveals the whole Bloch band structure, and
highlights the number of layers stacked in the material, as well as the
${\pi}$-quantized Berry phases that characterize the existence of nodal points
in the semimetallic spectrum. Experimentally, these features may be probed from

to the Euclid-based CIB maps, to accurately isolate the history of CIB

baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) at those epochs. To identify the BAO
signature, we would assemble individual CIB maps over conservatively large

spectrum by z to sub-percent statistical accuracy. We illustrate this with a
specific model of CIB production at high z normalized to reproduce the measured

small component from high-z sources, the amplitude of that component can be
accurately isolated with the methodology proposed here and the BAO signatures
at z>~ 10 are recovered well from the CIB fluctuation spatial spectrum. Probing
the BAO at those redshifts will be an important test of the underlying

superluminous supernova iPTF13ehe stems from matter which is stripped from a
companion star when the supernova ejecta collide with it. The temporal
evolution, the line broadening, and the overall blueshift of the emission are
consistent with this interpretation. We scale the nebular H-alpha luminosity
predicted for Type Ia supernovae in single-degenerate systems to derive the
stripped mass required to explain the H-alpha luminosity of iPTF13ehe. We find
a stripped mass of 0.1 - 0.9 solar masses, assuming that the supernova
luminosity is powered by radioactivity or magnetar spin down. Because a central
heating source is required to excite the H-alpha emission, an
interaction-powered model is not favored for iPTF13ehe if the H-alpha emission
is from stripped matter. We derive a companion mass of more than 20 solar
masses and a binary separation of less than about 20 companion radii based on
the stripping efficiency during the collision, indicating that the supernova
progenitor and the companion formed a massive close binary system. If Type Ic
superluminous supernovae generally occur in massive close binary systems, the
early brightening observed previously in several Type Ic superluminous
supernovae may also be due to the collision with a close companion.
Observations of nebular hydrogen emission in future Type Ic superluminous
supernovae will enable us to test this interpretation.

Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) typically requires sampling using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To save computation time, the Markov
chains are only run for a small number of steps, which leads to a biased
estimate. This bias can cause RBM training algorithms such as Contrastive
Divergence (CD) learning to deteriorate. We adopt the idea behind Population
Monte Carlo (PMC) methods to devise a new RBM training algorithm termed
Population-Contrastive-Divergence (pop-CD). Compared to CD, it leads to a
consistent estimate and may have a significantly lower bias. Its computational
overhead is negligible compared to CD. However, the variance of the gradient
estimate increases. We experimentally show that pop-CD can significantly
outperform CD. In many cases, we observed a smaller bias and achieved higher
log-likelihood values. However, when the RBM distribution has many hidden
neurons, the consistent estimate of pop-CD may still have a considerable bias
and the variance of the gradient estimate requires a smaller learning rate.
Thus, despite its superior theoretical properties, it is not advisable to use
pop-CD in its current form on large problems.

compact form of the robot dynamics. Such a form is obtained by projecting the
rigid body dynamics onto the null space of the Constraint Jacobian. As
consequence of the projection, contact forces are removed from the model but
their effects are still taken into account. This approach permits to solve the
optimal control problem of a floating base constrained multibody system while
avoiding the use of an explicit contact model. We use direct transcription to
numerically solve the optimization. As the contact forces are not part of the
decision variables the size of the resultant discrete mathematical program is
reduced and therefore solutions can be obtained in a tractable time. Using a
predefined sequence of contact configurations (phases), our approach solves
motions where contact switches occur. Transitions between phases are
automatically resolved without using a model for switching dynamics. We present
results on a hydraulic quadruped robot (HyQ), including single phase (standing,
crouching) as well as multiple phase (rearing, diagonal leg balancing and

strong infrared excess, which we consider as cYSOs. This sample is used to
investigate the spatial distribution of the cYSOs with a nearest-neighbor
analysis. The surface density distribution of cYSOs agrees well with the shape
of the clouds as seen in our Herschel far-infrared survey. The strong decline
in the surface density of excess sources outside the area of the clouds
supports the hypothesis that our excess-selected sample consists predominantly
of cYSOs with a low level of background contamination. This analysis allows us
to identify 14 groups of cYSOs outside the central area. Our results suggest
that the total population of cYSOs in the CNC comprises about 164000 objects,
with a substantial fraction (~35%) located in the northern, still not well

interacting units to reach a dynamical consensus state where the system
collectively operates. Here we study the dynamics of self-organizing systems
and show that for generic directed networks the collective frequency of the
ensemble is {\it not} the same as the mean of the individuals' natural
frequencies. Specifically, we show that the collective frequency equals a
weighted average of the natural frequencies, where the weights are given by an
out-flow centrality measure that is equivalent to a reverse PageRank
centrality. Our findings uncover an intricate dependence of the collective
frequency on both the structural directedness and dynamical heterogeneity of
the network, and also reveal an unexplored connection between synchronization
and PageRank, which opens the possibility of applying PageRank optimization to
synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of collective frequency
variation in real-world networks by considering the UK and Scandinavian power
grids.

description of physical, chemical or biological processes. The random walk
schema is a useful tool for formulating these models. Recently, evanescent
random walk models have received attention in order to include finite lifetime
processes. For instance, activated chemical reactions, such as laser
photolysis, exhibit a different asymptotic limit when compared with immortal
walker models. A diffusion limited reaction model based on a one dimensional
continuous time random walk on a lattice with evanescent walkers is presented
here. The absorption probability density and the reaction rate are analytically
calculated in the Laplace domain. A finite absorption rate is considered, a
model usually referred to as imperfect trapping. Short and long time behaviors
are analyzed.

scale of the system bring new challenges for application users and
software/middleware developers. In that context, and to provide best
performance, resiliency and energy efficiency, software may be provided as a
service oriented approach, adjusting resource utilization to best meet facility
and user requirements. Remote procedure call (RPC) is a technique that
originally followed a client/server model and allowed local calls to be
transparently executed on remote resources. RPC consists of serializing the
local function parameters into a memory buffer and sending that buffer to a
remote target that in turn deserializes the parameters and executes the
corresponding function call, returning the result back to the caller. Building
reusable services requires the definition of a communication model to remotely
access these services and for this purpose, RPC can serve as a foundation for
accessing them. We introduce the necessary building blocks to enable this
ecosystem to software and middleware developers with an RPC framework called
Mercury.

industry - as productivity can be enhanced by a controlled fracturing
operation. Fracturing also has a big impact on CO2 storage, geothermal
installation and gas production at and from the reservoir rocks. Therefore,
understanding the fracturing behavior of different types of reservoir rocks is
a basic need for planning field operations towards these activities. In our
study, the fracturing of rock sample is monitored by Acoustic Emission (AE) and
post-experiment Computer Tomography (CT) scans. The fracturing experiments have
been performed on hollow cylinder cores of different rocks - sandstones and
chalks. Our analysis show that the amplitudes and energies of acoustic events
clearly indicate initiation and propagation of the main fractures. The
amplitudes of AE events follow an exponential distribution while the energies
follow a power law distribution. Time-evolution of the radial strain measured
in the fracturing-test will later be compared to model predictions of fracture
size.

dielectric constant of Al/MA/p-Si have been investigated. Dielectric properties
and electrical conductivity of contact structures have been investigated in
detail by using spectroscopic technique in a wide range of frequencies and
applied bias voltages at room temperature. The values of dielectric constant,
dielectric loss, dielectric loss tangent, real and imaginary parts of the
electrical modulus and ac electrical conductivity were found considerably
sensitive to frequency and applied bias voltage especially in depletion and
accumulation regions. Experimental results indicate that the values of
dielectric constant show a steep decrease with increasing frequency for each
voltage. The values of dielectric loss as a function of voltage show a jump,
and dielectric loss decreases with decreasing voltage and increasing frequency.
The weak increasing of the ac electrical conductivity on frequency is observed.
The real part of electric modulus increases with increasing frequency. Also,
the imaginary part of electric modulus shows a peak and the peak position
shifts to higher frequency with increasing applied voltage. It can be concluded
that the interfacial polarization can be more easily occurred at low
frequencies and the majority of interface states at metal semiconductor
interface contributes to deviation of dielectric properties of Al/MA/p-Si
structures.
