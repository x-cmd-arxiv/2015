equation L u=f under the homogeneous boundary condition u=0. It is well known
that f in C(Om) (Om= Omega) does not guarantee second order derivatives D^2 u
in C(Om). This gap led to look for functional spaces C_*(Om), contained in
C(Om), as large as possible, for which f in C_*(Om) merely guarantees the
continuity of D^2 u (but nothing more, say). H\""older continuity is too
restrictive to fulfill this minimal requirement since in this case D^2 u
inherits the whole regularity enjoyed by f (we say that ""full regularity""
occurs). This two opposite situations led us to look for significant cases in
which intermediate regularity (i.e., between ""mere continuity"" and ""full
regularity"") occurs. This holds for data in Log spaces D^{0,a}(Om) (a= alpha)
where 0< a < infty, simply obtained by replacing in the modulus of continuity
of H\""older spaces the quantity 1/|x-y| by log(1/|x-y|). If f in D^{0,a} for
some fixed a > 1, then D^2 u in D^{0,a-1}. This regularity is optimal. The
above picture opened the way to further investigation. Below we study the more
general problem of data f in subspaces of continuous functions D_{om},
characterized by a given modulus of continuity om(r). H\""older and Log spaces
are particular cases. A significant new, lets say curious, case is shown by the
family of functional spaces C^{0,l}_a (l= lambda), where 0 <= l < 1, and a in
R. In particular, C^{0,l}_0= C^{0,l}, is a H\""older space, and C^{0,0}_a =
D^{0,a}, is a Log space. Main point is that full regularity occurs for l > 0,
and arbitrary a in R. If f in C^{0,l}_a then D^2 u in C^{0,l}_a.

continuation to an earlier work, we look for a physical parametrization in the
N=4 case that allows to accommodate the lightest mesons. Using zero-momentum
curvature masses to approximate the physical masses, we find that, in the
parameter range where a relatively large sigma mass is obtained, the scale of
the Landau pole is lower compared to that obtained in the two-loop truncation.
This jeopardizes the insensitivity of the observables to the ultraviolet
regulator and could hinder the predictivity of the model. Both in the N=1 and
N=4 cases, we also find that, when approaching the chiral limit, the
(iterative) solution to the Phi-derivable equations is lost in an interval
around the would-be transition temperature. In particular, it is not possible
to conclude at this order of truncation on the order of the transition in the
chiral limit. Because the same issue could be present in other approaches, we
investigate it thoroughly by considering a localized version of the
Phi-derivable equations, whose solution displays the same qualitative features,
but allows for a more analytical understanding of the problem. In particular,
our analysis reveals the existence of unphysical branches of solutions which
can coalesce with the physical one at some temperatures, with the effect of
opening up a gap in the admissible values for the condensate. Depending on its
rate of growth with the temperature, this gap can eventually engulf the

Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger and Green's function perturbation theories,
self-consistent Born approximation, mean-field approach, Feynman's variational

absorption lines using the large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10. We confirm that variations of absorption
lines are highly coordinated among different components of the same ion or the
same absorption component of different ions for C IV, Si IV and N V.
Furthermore, we show that the equivalent widths of the lines decrease or
increase statistically when the continuum brightens or dims. This is further
supported by the synchronized variations of emission and absorption line
equivalent width, when the well established intrinsic Baldwin effect for
emission lines is taken into account. We find that the emergence of an
absorption component is usually accompanying with dimming of the continuum
while the disappearance of an absorption line component with brightening of the
continuum. This suggests that the emergence or disappearance of a C IV
absorption component is only the extreme case, when the ionic column density is
very sensitive to continuum variations or the continuum variability amplitude
is larger. These results support the idea that absorption line variability is
driven mainly by changes in the gas ionization in response to continuum
variations, that the line-absorbing gas is highly ionized, and in some extreme
cases, too highly ionized to be detected in UV absorption lines. Due to
uncertainties in the spectroscopic flux calibration, we cannot quantify the
fraction of quasars with asynchronized continuum and absorption line
variations.

theorem for locally conformal symplectic manifolds of the first kind. In the

  Elementary Trapping Sets of Variable-Regular LDPC Codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a new characterization for elementary trapping sets
(ETSs) of variable-regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Recently,
Karimi and Banihashemi proposed a characterization of ETSs, which was based on
viewing an ETS as a layered superset (LSS) of a short cycle in the code's
Tanner graph. A notable advantage of LSS characterization is that it
corresponds to a simple LSS-based search algorithm that starts from short
cycles of the graph and finds the ETSs with LSS structure efficiently. Compared
to the LSS-based characterization of Karimi and Banihashemi, which is based on
a single LSS expansion technique, the new characterization involves two
additional expansion techniques. The introduction of the new techniques
mitigates two problems that LSS-based characterization/search suffers from: (1)
exhaustiveness, (2) search efficiency. We prove that using the three expansion
techniques, any ETS structure can be obtained starting from a simple cycle, no
matter how large the size of the structure $a$ or the number of its unsatisfied
check nodes $b$ are. We also demonstrate that for the proposed
characterization/search to exhaustively cover all the ETS structures within the
$(a,b)$ classes with $a \leq a_{max}, b \leq b_{max}$, for any value of
$a_{max}$ and $b_{max}$, the length of the short cycles required to be
enumerated is less than that of the LSS-based characterization/search. We also
prove that the three expansion techniques, proposed here, are the only
expansions needed for characterization of ETS structures starting from simple
cycles in the graph, if one requires each and every intermediate sub-structure
to be an ETS as well. Extensive simulation results are provided to show that,
compared to LSS-based search, significant improvement in search speed and
memory requirements can be achieved.

severe deviations of general relativity with respect to Newtonian gravity: the

be catalysts of deep physical developments, especially when combined with the
principles of quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, it is seldom remarked that it is
hardly possible to combine all these developments into a unified theoretical
model, while maintaining reasonable prospects for the independent experimental
corroboration of its different parts. In this paper we review the current
theoretical understanding of the physics of gravitational collapse in order to

evaporating black holes stands for. This serves as the motivation for the
discussion of a recent proposal that offers the opposite perspective,
represented by a set of geometries that regularize the classical singular
behavior and present modifications of the near-horizon Schwarzschild geometry
as the result of the propagation of non-perturbative ultraviolet effects
originated in regions of high curvature. We present an extensive exploration of

understand the tax relevance of administrative boundaries in the quality of
life of its citizens. The modeling involves the construction of a computational
algorithm, which includes citizens, bounded into families; firms and
governments; all of them interacting in markets for goods, labor and real
estate. The real estate market allows families to move to dwellings with higher
quality or lower price when the families capitalize property values. The goods
market allows consumers to search on a flexible number of firms choosing by
price and proximity. The labor market entails a matching process between firms
(location) and candidates (qualification). The government may be configured
into one, four or seven distinct sub-national governments. The role of
government is to collect taxes on the value added of firms in its territory and
invest the taxes into higher levels of quality of life for residents. The model
does not have a credit market. The results suggest that the configuration of
administrative boundaries is relevant to the levels of quality of life arising
from the reversal of taxes. The model with seven regions is more dynamic, with
higher GDP values, but more unequal and heterogeneous across regions. The
simulation with only one region is more homogeneously poor. The study seeks to
contribute to a theoretical and methodological framework as well as to
describe, operationalize and test computer models of public finance analysis,
with explicitly spatial and dynamic emphasis. Several alternatives of expansion
of the model for future research are described. Moreover, this study adds to
the existing literature in the realm of simple microeconomic computational
models, specifying structural relationships between local governments and
firms, consumers and dwellings mediated by distance.

discs (e.g. Springel & Hernquist 2005), but the possibility that they could
explain the emergence of lenticular galaxies (S0s) has been generally
neglected. In fact, observations of S0s reveal a strong structural coupling
between their bulges and discs, which seems difficult to reconcile with the
idea that they come from major mergers. However, in Querejeta et al. (2015a) we
have used N-body simulations of binary mergers to show that, under favourable
conditions, discs are first destroyed but soon regrow out of the leftover
debris, matching observational photometric scaling relations (e.g. Laurikainen
et al. 2010). Additionally, in Querejeta et al. (2015b) we have shown how the
merger scenario agrees with the recent discovery that S0s and most spirals are
not compatible in an angular momentum--concentration plane. This important
result from CALIFA constitutes a serious objection to the idea that spirals
transform into S0s mainly by fading (e.g. via ram-pressure stripping, as that
would not explain the observed simultaneous change in $\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ and
concentration), but our simulations of major mergers do explain that mismatch.
From such a 3D comparison we conclude that mergers must be a relevant process
in the build-up of the current population of S0s.

a set of given passbands are fitted jointly with PHOENIX-calculated stellar
limb darkening profiles. The analysis is carried out assuming both white and
red -- temporally correlated -- noise, with two approaches (Gaussian processes
and divide-by-white) to account for the red noise.
  An initial analysis reveals a transmission spectrum that shows a strong
Rayleigh-like increase in extinction towards the blue end of the spectrum, and
enhanced extinction around the K I resonance doublet near 767 nm. However, the
signal amplitudes are significantly larger than expected from theoretical
considerations. A detailed analysis reveals that the K I-like feature is
entirely due to variability in the telluric O$_2$ absorption, but the
Rayleigh-like feature remains unexplained.

a simplified model consisting of three layers in the quasi-geostrophic
approximation. The linear stability analysis shows that short-wave
instabilities are created by the interplay between the shear in the upper and
the lower layers. If the stratification is non-uniform, in particular surface
intensified, the linear growth rate is larger for short-wave instabilities than
for long-wave instabilities and the layers are essentially decoupled, with the
small scales growing independently. The fully developed homogeneous turbulence
is studied in a number of numerical experiments. Results show that in both the
case of equal layer depths and surface intensified stratification an inverse
cascade in kinetic energy is observed. The modal kinetic energy spectra for the
case with surface intensified stratification show higher energy for higher
baroclinic numbers at small scales, due to the decoupling of the layers. As a
result, while the case with equal layer depths shows large barotropic
instabilities with large scale gradients of potential temperature, the surface
intensified stratification is characterized by a transition from surface
dynamics, characterized by a patchy distribution of vorticity, to interior
dynamics, characterized by vorticity filamentation. The effect of the
short-wave instabilities can be seen in the probability distribution functions
of the potential vorticity anomaly, which reduces to a Gaussian distribution
when the growth rate of the short-wave instabilities is larger than the growth
rate for the long-wave instabilities. The surface intensified stratification
also alters the vertical structure of the potential vorticity fluxes and shows
deviations of the fluxes from a scaling obtained assuming that the turbulence
acts as a downgradient diffusion.

intense research over the last two decades. Since many stencil schemes have low
arithmetic intensity, most optimizations focus on increasing the temporal data
access locality, thus reducing the data traffic through the main memory
interface with the ultimate goal of decoupling from this bottleneck. There are,
however, only few approaches that explicitly leverage the shared cache feature
of modern multicore chips. If every thread works on its private, separate cache
block, the available cache space can become too small, and sufficient temporal
locality may not be achieved.
  We propose a flexible multi-dimensional intra-tile parallelization method for
stencil algorithms on multicore CPUs with a shared outer-level cache. This
method leads to a significant reduction in the required cache space without
adverse effects from hardware prefetching or TLB shortage. Our \emph{Girih}
framework includes an auto-tuner to select optimal parameter configurations on
the target hardware. We conduct performance experiments on two contemporary
Intel processors and compare with the state-of-the-art stencil frameworks PLUTO
and Pochoir, using four corner-case stencil schemes and a wide range of problem
sizes. \emph{Girih} shows substantial performance advantages and best
arithmetic intensity at almost all problem sizes, especially on low-intensity
stencils with variable coefficients. We study in detail the performance
behavior at varying grid size using phenomenological performance modeling. Our
analysis of energy consumption reveals that our method can save energy by
reduced DRAM bandwidth usage even at marginal performance gain. It is thus well
suited for future architectures that will be strongly challenged by the cost of
data movement, be it in terms of performance or energy consumption.

studying a broad range of important phenomena in many-body physics, from
virtually mediated interactions to decoherence and thermalization. In many
atomic, molecular, and optical systems, such models also underlie the most
successful attempts to engineer strong, long-ranged interactions for the
purpose of entanglement generation. Especially when the coupling between the
spins and bosons is strong---such that it cannot be treated
perturbatively---the properties of such models are extremely challenging to
calculate theoretically. Here, exact analytical expressions for nonequilibrium
spin-spin correlation functions are derived for a specific model of spins
coupled to bosons. The spatial structure of the coupling between spins and
bosons is completely arbitrary, and thus the solution can be applied to systems
in any number of dimensions. The explicit and nonperturbative inclusion of the
bosons enables the study of entanglement generation (in the form of spin
squeezing) even when the bosons are driven strongly and near-resonantly, and
thus provides a quantitative view of the breakdown of adiabatic elimination
that inevitably occurs as one pushes towards the fastest entanglement
generation possible. The solution also helps elucidate the effect of finite
temperature on spin squeezing. The model considered is relevant to a variety of
atomic, molecular, and optical systems, such as atoms in cavities or trapped
ions. As an explicit example, the results are used to quantify phonon effects
in trapped ion quantum simulators, which are expected to become increasingly
important as these experiments push towards larger numbers of ions.

seen during the rise can be well explained by a spreading hot spot model, but
large amplitude oscillations in the decay phase remain mysterious because of
the absence of a clear-cut source of asymmetry. To date there have not been any
quantitative studies that consistently track the oscillation amplitude both
during the rise and decay (cooling tail) of bursts. Here we compute the light
curves and amplitudes of oscillations in X-ray burst models that realistically
account for both flame spreading and subsequent cooling. We present results for
several such ""cooling wake"" models, a ""canonical"" cooling model where each
patch on the NS surface heats and cools identically, or with a
latitude-dependent cooling timescale set by the local effective gravity, and an
""asymmetric"" model where parts of the star cool at significantly different

rate (sSFR) relation, EW versus stellar mass relation, line-of-sight velocity
dispersion, dynamical mass, and stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio are similar for
filament and field star-forming galaxies. However, we show that on average,
filament star-forming galaxies are more metal-enriched ($\sim$ 0.1$-$0.15 dex),
possibly due to the inflow of the already enriched intrafilamentary gas into
filament galaxies. Moreover, we show that electron densities are significantly
lower (a factor of $\sim$17) in filament star-forming systems compared to those
in the field, possibly because of a longer star-formation timescale for
filament star-forming galaxies. Our results highlight the potential
pre-processing role of galaxy filaments and intermediate-density environments
on the evolution of galaxies, which has been highly underestimated.

Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs). This inhomogeneous class of objects of
remnants of tidally stripped dwarf elliptical galaxies and high mass globular
clusters. We use three methods to unravel their nature: 1) we analysed their
surface brightness profiles, 2) we carried out a direct search for tidal
features around UCDs and 3) we compared the spatial distribution of GCs and
UCDs in the halo of their host galaxy.
  Based on FORS2 observations, we have studied the detailed structural
composition of a large sample of 97 UCDs in the halo of NGC1399, the central
galaxy of the Fornax cluster, by analysing theirsurface brightness profiles. We
derived the structural parameters of 13 extended UCDs modelling them with a
single Sersic function and decomposing them into composite King and Sersic
profiles. We find evidence for faint stellar envelopes at mu=~26 mag\arcsec^-2
surrounding the UCDs up to an extension of 90pc in radius.
  We also show new evidence for faint asymmetric structures and tidal tail-like
features surrounding several of these UCDs, a possible tracer of their origin
and assembly history within their host galaxy halos. In particular, we present
evidence for the first discovery of a significant tidal tail with an extension
of ~350pc around UCD-FORS2.
  We searched for local overdensities in the spatial distribution of globular
clusters within the halo of NGC1399, to see if they are related to the
positions of the UCDs. We found a local overabundance of globular clusters on a
scale of <1kpc around UCDs, when we compare it to the distribution of globulars
from the host galaxy. This effect is strongest for the metal-poor blue GCs. We
discuss how likely it is that these clustered globulars were originally
associated with the UCD.

density distribution of an exponential disk, it is independent of spectral type

luminosity function, we show that their number counts typically peak around
J~24 mag with a total surface density of Sigma ~ 0.3 arcmin^-2, but with a
strong dependence on galactic coordinate and spectral type. Owing to the
exponential shape of the disk, the ultracool dwarfs are very rare at faint
magnitudes (J>~27 mag), with typical densities of Sigma~0.005 arcmin^-2 (or
~20% of the total contribution within the field). Therefore in the very narrow
and deep fields, we predict there are only a few ultracool dwarfs, and hence
these stars are likely not a severe contaminant in searches for high-redshift
galaxies. Furthermore the ultracool dwarfs are expected to be considerably
brighter than the high-redshift galaxies, so samples near the faint-end of the
high-redshift galaxy population will be the purest. We present the star-count

find that even if buoyant plumes are able to locally transfer heat up to the
shock, convection is not able to create a net positive energy flux and overcome
the downwards transport of energy from the accretion flow. Turbulent convection
does, however, provide a significant effective pressure support to the
accretion flow as it favors the accumulation of energy, mass and momentum in
the gain region. We derive an approximate equation that is able to explain and
predict the shock evolution in terms of integrals of quantities such as the
turbulent pressure in the gain region or the effects of non-radial motion of
the fluid. We use this relation as a way to quantify the role of turbulence in
the dynamics of the accretion shock. Finally, we investigate the effects of
grid resolution, which we change by a factor 20 between the lowest and highest

are related at all is quite surprising, and is due to Uchiyama-Sasamoto-Wadati.
The ASEP is a model of particles hopping on a one-dimensional lattice of N
sites with open boundaries, particles can enter and exit at both left and right
borders. It was introduced around 1970 and is cited as a model for both traffic
flow and translation in protein synthesis. Meanwhile, the Askey-Wilson
polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in one variable, they sit at
the top of the hierarchy of classical orthogonal polynomials. So we have the
relationship
  ASEP -- staircase tableaux -- Askey-Wilson moments
  It is well-known that Askey-Wilson polynomials can be viewed as the
one-variable case of the multivariate Koornwinder polynomials, also known as
the Macdonald polynomials for the type BC root system. It is natural then to
ask whether one can generalize the relationships among the ASEP, Askey-Wilson
moments, and staircase tableaux, in such a way that Koornwinder moments replace
Askey-Wilson moments. In a recent work, we demonstrated a close connection
between Koornwinder moments and the two-species ASEP (a particle model
involving two species of particles with different ""weights""). In this article
we introduce rhombic staircase tableaux, and show that we have the relationship

is the source of critical data, upstream of the primary storage system. Placing
encryption near the source ensures that data remains encrypted throughout the
storage stack, making it easier to use untrusted storage, such as public

  Unfortunately, such a strategy also prevents downstream storage systems from
applying content-based features, such as deduplication, to the data. In this
paper, we present Lamassu, an encryption solution that uses block-oriented,
host-based, convergent encryption to secure data, while preserving
storage-based data deduplication. Unlike past convergent encryption systems,

  In this paper, we lay out the architecture and security model used in our

integrity in a convergent encryption environment. We also evaluate its storage
efficiency and I/O performance by using a variety of microbenchmarks, showing
that Lamassu provides excellent storage efficiency, while achieving I/O

continuum flux versus iron line flux correlation expected from fluorescence
emission along the line of sight. However, the observed iron line flux is
slightly higher, indicating the possibility of a higher iron abundance or the
presence of non-uniform material. We argue that the source most likely has only

$\mathcal{E}_0$, in particular, whether in the stochastic setting this growth
is different than in the deterministic case considered by Ayala \& Protas

possible singularity formation in hydrodynamic models. The main quantities of
interest in the stochastic problem are the expected value of the enstrophy and
the enstrophy of the expected value of the solution. The stochastic Burgers
equation is solved numerically with a Monte Carlo sampling approach. By
studying solutions obtained for a range of optimal initial data and different
noise magnitudes, we reveal different solution behaviors and it is demonstrated
that the two quantities always bracket the enstrophy of the deterministic

the same power-law dependence on the initial enstrophy $\mathcal{E}_0$as

excitation does not increase the extreme enstrophy growth beyond what is
already observed in the deterministic case.

which self-gravitating structures are created by turbulence-driven density
fluctuations. Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully
reproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the
initial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of
isothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a
fragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,
the fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are
scale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show
that, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a
mass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent
cloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation
and after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a
scale-free pure power-law distribution $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d} M\propto
M^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by
introducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the
cascade. Our candidate for such physics is a simple model for stellar radiation
feedback. Radiative heating, powered by accretion onto forming stars, arrests
the fragmentation cascade and imposes a characteristic mass scale that is
nearly independent of the time-evolution or initial conditions in the
star-forming cloud, and that agrees well with the peak of the observed IMF. In
contrast, models that introduce a stiff equation of state for denser clouds but
that do not explicitly include the effects of feedback do not yield an
invariant IMF.

algorithms-by-tiles treating a matrix tile as the basic data unit and
operations on tiles as the basic task. Tasks are guided with a dynamic
asynchronous runtime, which is cache and locality aware. The communication cost
under BLASX becomes trivial as it perfectly overlaps communication and
computation across multiple streams during asynchronous task progression. It
also takes the current tile cache scheme one step further by proposing an
innovative 2-level hierarchical tile cache, taking advantage of inter-GPU P2P
communication. As a result, linear speedup is observable with BLASX under
multi-GPU configurations; and the extensive benchmarks demonstrate that BLASX

BTZ black hole in AdS space in the context of both classical and quantum
mechanics. This is done by first deriving the conserved mass of a ""spherically""
symmetric domain wall, which is taken as the classical Hamiltonian of the black
hole. Upon deriving the conserved mass, we also point out that, for a
""spherically"" symmetric shell, there is an easy and straight-forward way of
determining the conserved mass, which is related to the proper time derivative
of the interior and exterior times. This method for determining the conserved
mass is generic to any situation (i.e. any equation of state), since it only
depends on the energy per unit area, $\sigma$, of the shell.
  Classically, we show that the time taken for gravitational collapse follows
that of the typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse, that
is, an asymptotic observer will see that the collapse takes an infinite amount
of time to occur, while an infalling observer will see the collapse to both the
horizon and the classical singularity occur in a finite amount of time. Quantum
mechanically, we take primary interest in the behavior of the collapse near the
horizon and near the classical singularity from the point of view of both
asymptotic and infalling observers. In the absence of radiation and
fluctuations of the metric, quantum effects near the horizon do not change the
classical conclusions for an asymptotic observer. The most interesting quantum
mechanical effect comes in when investigating near the classical singularity.
Here, we find, that the quantum effects in this region are able to remove the
classical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is non-singular,
and is also displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy density of
the domain wall.

today's life. For applications such as predicting users' political preference,
it is particularly important to be able to analyze the dynamics of competing
opinions. While observing the evolution of polar opinions of a social network's
users over time, can we tell when the network ""behaved"" abnormally?
Furthermore, can we predict how the opinions of the users will change in the
future? Do opinions evolve according to existing network opinion dynamics
models? To answer such questions, it is not sufficient to study individual user
behavior, since opinions can spread far beyond users' egonets. We need a method
to analyze opinion dynamics of all network users simultaneously and capture the
effect of individuals' behavior on the global evolution pattern of the social
network.
  In this work, we introduce Social Network Distance (SND) - a distance measure
that quantifies the ""cost"" of evolution of one snapshot of a social network
into another snapshot under various models of polar opinion propagation. SND
has a rich semantics of a transportation problem, yet, is computable in time
linear in the number of users, which makes SND applicable to the analysis of
large-scale online social networks. In our experiments with synthetic and
real-world Twitter data, we demonstrate the utility of our distance measure for
anomalous event detection. It achieves a true positive rate of 0.83, twice as
high as that of alternatives. When employed for opinion prediction in Twitter,
our method's accuracy is 75.63%, which is 7.5% higher than that of the next
best method.

heavy scalar field $\chi$ on the curvature perturbation $\zeta$. Integrating
out $\chi$, we derive the effective action for $\zeta$, which includes the loop
corrections of the heavy field $\chi$. When the mass of $\chi$ is much larger
than the Hubble scale $H$, the loop corrections of $\chi$ only yield a local
contribution to the effective action and hence the effective action simply
gives an action for $\zeta$ in a single field model, where, as is widely known,
$\zeta$ is conserved in time after the Hubble crossing time. Meanwhile, when
the mass of $\chi$ is comparable to $H$, the loop corrections of $\chi$ can
give a non-local contribution to the effective action. Because of the non-local
contribution from $\chi$, in general, $\zeta$ may not be conserved, even if the
classical background trajectory is determined only by the evolution of the
inflaton. In this paper, we derive the condition that $\zeta$ is conserved in
time in the presence of the radiative corrections from $\chi$. Namely, we show
that when the scaling symmetry, which is a part of the diffeomorphism
invariance, is preserved at the quantum level, the loop corrections of the
massive field $\chi$ do not disturb the constant evolution of $\zeta$ at super
Hubble scales. In this discussion, we show the Ward-Takahashi identity for the
scaling symmetry, which yields a consistency relation for the correlation
functions of the massive field $\chi$.

the multi-media traffics. In caching networks, coded caching is a recently
proposed technique that achieves significant performance gains over the uncoded
caching schemes. However, to implement the coded caching schemes, each file has
to be split into $F$ packets, which usually increases exponentially with the
number of users $K$. Thus, designing caching schemes that decrease the order of
$F$ is meaningful for practical implementations. In this paper, by reviewing
the Ali-Niesen caching scheme, the placement delivery array (PDA) design
problem is firstly formulated to characterize the placement issue and the
delivery issue with a single array. Moreover, we show that, through designing
appropriate PDA, new centralized coded caching schemes can be discovered.
Secondly, it is shown that the Ali-Niesen scheme corresponds to a special class
of PDA, which realizes the best coding gain with the least $F$. Thirdly, we
present a new construction of PDA for the centralized caching system, wherein
the cache size of each user $M$ (identical cache size is assumed at all users)

conductance switching. In this study, we probed the atomic composition, local
chemistry and electronic structure of functioning tantalum oxide memristors
through spatially mapped O K-edge x-ray absorption. We developed a
time-multiplexed spectromicroscopy technique to enhance the weak and possibly
localized oxide modifications with spatial and spectral resolutions of <30 nm
and 70 meV, respectively. During the initial stages of conductance switching of
a micrometer sized crosspoint device, the spectral changes were uniform within
the spatial resolution of our technique. When the device was further driven
with millions of high voltage-pulse cycles, we observed lateral motion and
separation of ~100 nm-scale agglomerates of both oxygen interstitials and
vacancies. We also demonstrate a unique capability of this technique by
identifying the relaxation behavior in the material during electrical stimuli
by identifying electric field driven changes with varying pulse widths. In
addition, we show that changes to the material can be localized to a spatial
region by modifying its topography or uniformity, as against spatially uniform

connection to both charge and spin structure factors. Here we use
state-of-the-art, unbiased numerical calculations to study the low energy
excitations probed by RIXS in undoped and doped Hubbard model relevant to the
cuprates. The results highlight the importance of scattering geometry, in
particular both the incident and scattered x-ray photon polarization, and
demonstrate that on a qualitative level the RIXS spectral shape in the
cross-polarized channel approximates that of the spin dynamical structure
factor. However, in the parallel-polarized channel the complexity of the RIXS
process beyond a simple two-particle response complicates the analysis, and
demonstrates that approximations and expansions which attempt to relate RIXS to
less complex correlation functions can not reproduce the full diversity of RIXS
spectral features.

silicate rich dust grains containing a significant component of AlO bonding was
formed sometime between 1998 and 2003. Observations using Spitzer between 2005
and 2009 show significant changes in the 10 micron silicate stretch feature.
There is a deepening of the 10 micron silicate stretch as well as the
development of a feature between about 13 and 20 microns consistent with a
blend of the MgO and FeO stretching features and the O-Si-O bending mode of
increasingly ordered silicate dust. Near-infrared observations show the
presence of AlO and water vapor in the outflow in 2003, 2004 and 2005: the AlO
has significantly decreased in spectra obtained in 2014 while the water vapor
remains largely unchanged. An attempt is made to correlate these observations
and understand the significance of these changes using DUSTY modeling. The
observations appear consistent with the kinetically-controlled, condensation of
highly under-oxidized SiO/AlO/Fe/Mg dust grains in the outflow followed by the
continuous evolution of the initial condensate due to thermal annealing and
oxidation of the dust via reaction with ambient O, OH and H2O in the expanding,
cooling shell. Periodic monitoring of this dust shell over the mid-infrared
spectral range could yield useful information on the evolution of
under-oxidized silicate condensates exposed to hot water vapor in more

exact and sufficiently accurate in commonly used tail regions. Moreover, we
prove that the formula obtained is equivalent to the expectation of the
Euler-Poincare characteristic of the excursion set of the chi-square random

the distribution of their mass-ratios and investigated univariate relations
with several parameters of the host GCs. We confirm the anti-correlation
between the binary fraction and the luminosity of the host cluster, and find
that low-luminosity clusters can host a large population in excess of ~40% in
the cluster core. However, our results do not support a significant correlation

more centrally concentrated than single stars. If the fraction of binaries is
normalised to the core binary fraction the radial density profiles follow a
common trend. It has a maximum in the center and declines by a factor of two at
a distance of about two core radii from the cluster center. After dropping to
its minimum at a radial distance of $\sim$5 core radii it stays approximately
constant at larger radii. We also find that the mass-ratio and the distribution

solutions and the corresponding pulse times of arrival are prerequisites for
further study, e.g. phase-resolved spectroscopy or searches for mode switches.
Many gamma-ray pulsars are strongly affected by timing noise, and we present a
new method for characterizing the noise process and mitigating its effects on
other facets of the timing model. We present an analysis of timing noise over
the population using a new metric for characterizing its strength and spectral
shape, namely its time-domain correlation. The dependence of the strength on
spin frequency and spin-down rate is in good agreement with previous studies.
We find that noise process power spectra $S(f)$ for unrecycled pulsars are
steep, with strong correlations over our entire data set and spectral indices
$S(f)\propto f^{-\alpha}$ of 5 to 9. One possible explanation for these results
is the occurrence of unmodelled, episodic 'microglitches'. Finally, we show
that our treatment of timing noise results in robust parameter estimation, and
in particular we measure a precise timing position for each pulsar. We
extensively validate our results with multi-wavelength astrometry, and using
our updated position, we firmly identify the X-ray counterpart of PSR

interpolates between the original non-symmetric random walk and the symmetrized
one. We then capture the Brownian motion with a constant drift of the
asymptotic direction on the Euclidean space with the Albanese metric associated
with the symmetrized random walk through another kind of central limit theorem
for the family of random walks. In the latter half of the present paper, we
give a spectral geometric proof of the asymptotic expansion of the $n$-step
transition probability for the non-symmetric random walk. This asymptotic
expansion is a refinement of the local central limit theorem obtained by Sunada
[22] and is a generalization of the result in [11] for symmetric random walks

studies geometric patterns of deformations between shapes. Recently,
computational QC geometry has been developed and has made significant
contributions to medical imaging, computer graphics and computer vision.
Existing computational QC theories and algorithms have been built on
triangulation structures. In practical situations, many 3D acquisition
techniques often produce 3D point cloud (PC) data of the object, which does not
contain connectivity information. It calls for a need to develop computational
QC theories on PCs. In this paper, we introduce the concept of computational QC
geometry on PCs. We define PC quasi-conformal (PCQC) maps and their associated
PC Beltrami coefficients (PCBCs). The PCBC is analogous to the Beltrami
differential in the continuous setting. Theoretically, we show that the PCBC
converges to its continuous counterpart as the density of the PC tends to zero.
We also theoretically and numerically validate the ability of PCBCs to measure
local geometric distortions of PC deformations. With these concepts, many
existing QC based algorithms for geometry processing and shape analysis can be
easily extended to PC data.

  Factorization based on ALAP scheduling",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the advent of multicore architectures and massive parallelism, the
tiled Cholesky factorization algorithm has recently received plenty of
attention and is often referenced by practitioners as a case study. It is also
implemented in mainstream dense linear algebra libraries. However, we note that
theoretical study of the parallelism of this algorithm is currently lacking. In
this paper, we present new theoretical results about the tiled Cholesky
factorization in the context of a parallel homogeneous model without
communication costs. We use standard flop-based weights for the tasks. For a
$t$-by-$t$ matrix, we know that the critical path of the tiled Cholesky
algorithm is $9t-10$ and that the weight of all tasks is $t^3$. In this
context, we prove that no schedule with less than $0.185 t^2$ processing units
can finish in a time less than the critical path. In perspective, a naive bound
gives $0.11 t^2.$ We then give a schedule which needs less than $0.25
t^2+0.16t+3$ processing units to complete in the time of the critical path. In
perspective, a naive schedule gives $0.50 t^2.$ In addition, given a fixed
number of processing units, $p$, we give a lower bound on the execution time as
follows: $$\max( \frac{t^{3}}{p}, \frac{t^{3}}{p} - 3\frac{t^2}{p} + 6\sqrt{2p}
- 7 , 9t-10).$$ The interest of the latter formula lies in the middle term. Our
results stem from the observation that the tiled Cholesky factorization is much
better behaved when we schedule it with an ALAP (As Late As Possible) heuristic
than an ASAP (As Soon As Possible) heuristic. We also provide scheduling
heuristics which match closely the lower bound on execution time. We believe
that our theoretical results will help practical scheduling studies. Indeed,
our results enable to better characterize the quality of a practical schedule
with respect to an optimal schedule.

harmonic oscillators, a fully canonical quantization of the electromagnetic
field is demonstrated in the presence of such a medium. Some coupling tensors
of various ranks are introduced that couple the magnetodielectric medium with
the electromagnetic field. The polarization and magnetization fields of the
medium are defined in terms of the coupling tensors and the oscillators
modeling the medium. The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the
medium are obtained in terms of the coupling tensors. It is shown that the
electric field satisfy an integral equation in frequency domain. The integral
equation is solved by an iteration method and the electric field is found up to
an arbitrary accuracy.

methods for determining multifractal characteristics is Multifractal Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA). However, it has some drawback. One of its core
elements is detrending of the series. In the classical MFDFA a trend is
estimated by fitting a polynomial of degree $m$ where $m=const$. We propose
that the degree $m$ of a polynomial was not constant ($m\neq const$) and its
selection was ruled by an established criterion. Taking into account the above
amendment, we examine the multifractal spectra both for artificial and
real-world mono- and the multifractal time series. Unlike classical MFDFA

results and for real time series we observe a significant right side shift of

significant variation in $P$ at the phase angle coverage of

degrees $P_\mathrm{max}$=30.8% for the nucleus and $P_\mathrm{max}$=29.6% for

of dust-rich comets. The low geometric albedo of $P_v$=0.05 was derived from
the slope-albedo relationship and was associated with high $P_\mathrm{max}$. We
examined $P_\mathrm{max}$-albedo relations between asteroids and 209P, and

a particle-based rather than a field-based approach with the initialisation of
particles in proportion to their flux. This method allows accurate prediction
of the steady state and is applicable even at high P\'eclet numbers where
traditional particle-based Monte-Carlo methods starting from randomly
initialised particle distributions fail. We demonstrate that generating a flux
of particles according to a predetermined density and velocity distribution at
a single fixed time and initial location allows for accurate simulation of mass
transport under flow. Specifically, upon initialisation in proportion to their
flux, these particles are propagated individually and detected by summing up
their Monte-Carlo trajectories in predefined detection regions. We demonstrate
quantitative agreement of the predicted concentration profiles with the results
of experiments performed with fluorescent particles in microfluidic channels
under continuous flow. This approach is computationally advantageous and
readily allows non-trivial initial distributions to be considered. In
particular, this method is highly suitable for simulating advective and
diffusive transport in microfluidic devices.

systematics, must be employed to recover the correct signal shape. As a
by-product of the tests on the K2 data, we find that for longer period
sinusoidal signals the detection rate decreases (after an optimum value is
reached) as the number of light curves used for systematics filtering
increases. The decline of the detection rate is observable in both methods of
filtering, albeit the simultaneous method performs better in the regime of
relative high template number. We suspect that the observed phenomenon is
linked to the increased role of low amplitude intrinsic stellar variability in
the space-based data. This assumption is also supported by the substantially
higher stability of the detection rates for transit signals against the
increase of the template number.

ratio of H2 (OPR(H2)) during the formation and early evolution of a molecular
cloud, following the scenario that accretion flows sweep and accumulate HI gas
to form molecular clouds. We follow the physical evolution of post-shock
materials using a one-dimensional shock model, with post-processing gas-ice
chemistry simulations. This approach allows us to study the evolution of the
OPR(H2) and water deuteration ratio without an arbitrary assumption concerning
the initial molecular abundances, including the initial OPR(H2). When the
conversion of hydrogen into H2 is almost complete, the OPR(H2) is already much
smaller than the statistical value of three due to the spin conversion in the
gas phase. As the gas accumulates, the OPR(H2) decreases in a non-equilibrium
manner. We find that water ice can be deuterium-poor at the end of its main
formation stage in the cloud, compared to water vapor observed in the vicinity
of low-mass protostars where water ice is likely sublimated. If this is the
case, the enrichment of deuterium in water should mostly occur at somewhat
later evolutionary stages of star formation, i.e., cold prestellar/protostellar
cores. The main mechanism to suppress water ice deuteration in the cloud is the
cycle of photodissociation and reformation of water ice, which efficiently
removes deuterium from water ice chemistry. The removal efficiency depends on
the main formation pathway of water ice. The OPR(H2) plays a minor role in
water ice deuteration at the main formation stage of water ice.

study wave propagation characteristics in a homogeneous pair-ion magnetized

the Hankel-Fourier transformation are shown comparable with those observed in
the experiment by Oohara and co-workers. The gyro-viscosity is responsible for
the change in propagation characteristics of the ion cyclotron wave from
forward to backward by suppressing the effect of the thermal pressure which
normally causes the forward nature of dispersion. Although the experiment has
been already explained by a kinetic theory by the present authors, the kinetic
derivations are so involved because of exact particle orbits in phase space,
finite Larmor radius effects, and higher order ion cyclotron resonances. The
present fluid theory provides a simple and transparent structure to the
dispersion relations since the gyro-viscosity is renormalized into the ion
cyclotron frequency which itself indicates the backward nature of dispersion.
The usual disadvantage of a fluid theory, which treats only fundamental modes
of eigen-waves excited in a system and is not able to describe higher harmonics
that a kinetic theory does, is compensated by simple derivations and clear
picture based on the renormalization of the gyro-viscosity.

use in multi-scale local feature detection algorithms, such as Speeded-Up
Robust Features (SURF), allowing fast computation of rectangular features at
constant speed, independent of filter size. For resource-constrained real-time
embedded vision systems, computation and storage of integral image presents
several design challenges due to strict timing and hardware limitations.
Although calculation of the integral image only consists of simple addition
operations, the total number of operations is large owing to the generally
large size of image data. Recursive equations allow substantial decrease in the
number of operations but require calculation in a serial fashion. This paper
presents two new hardware algorithms that are based on the decomposition of
these recursive equations, allowing calculation of up to four integral image
values in a row-parallel way without significantly increasing the number of
operations. An efficient design strategy is also proposed for a parallel
integral image computation unit to reduce the size of the required internal
memory (nearly 35% for common HD video). Addressing the storage problem of
integral image in embedded vision systems, the paper presents two algorithms
which allow substantial decrease (at least 44.44%) in the memory requirements.
Finally, the paper provides a case study that highlights the utility of the
proposed architectures in embedded vision systems.

preference over the more traditional velocity profile. In the report herein, we
use the flow governing equation approach to develop similarity criteria for the
two profiles. Results show that the derived similarity criteria are identical.
Together with previous work that found that defect profile similarity must be
accompanied by velocity profile similarity, then ones expectations must be that
either profile can be used to search for similarity in experimental datasets.
The choice should therefore be dictated by which one works best for
experimental investigations, which in this case is the velocity profile.

all individuals are close to an internal critical state, i.e. at the borderline
between order and disorder. We study --both analytically and computationally--
the circumstances under which criticality is the best possible outcome of the
dynamical process, confirming the convergence to critical points under very
generic conditions. Finally, we analyze the effect of cooperation (agents try
to enhance not only their fitness, but also that of other individuals) and
competition (agents try to improve their own fitness and to diminish those of
competitors) within our setting. The conclusion is that, while competition
fosters criticality, cooperation hinders it and can lead to more ordered or
more disordered consensual solutions.

development of high-performance thermoelectric materials for the conversion of
waste heat into electricity. We have studied phonon and electron transport in
alkane and oligoyne chains of various lengths and find that due to the more
rigid nature of the latter, the phonon thermal conductances of oligoynes are
counter intuitively lower than that of the corresponding alkanes. The thermal
conductance of oligoynes decreases monotonically with increasing length,
whereas the thermal conductance of alkanes initially increases with length and
then decreases. This difference in behaviour arises from phonon filtering by
the gold electrodes and disappears when higher-Debye-frequency electrodes are
used. Consequently a molecule that better transmits higher-frequency phonon
modes, combined with a low-Debye-frequency electrode that filters high-energy
phonons is a viable strategy for suppressing phonon transmission through the
molecular junctions. The low thermal conductance of oligoynes, combined with
their higher thermopower and higher electrical conductance lead to yield a
maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of ZT = 1.4, which is several orders of
magnitude higher than for alkanes.

solution for a unit cell model representing the flow characteristics of a
periodic fibrous medium, and iii) a scaling analysis of characteristic bulk

geometrical parameters of the system, and the fluid rheology. Our scaling
analysis yields simple expressions for evaluating the transverse mobility
functions for each model, which can be used for a wide range of medium porosity
and fluid rheological parameters. While the dimensionless mobility is, in
general, a function of the Carreau number and the medium porosity, our results
show that for porosities less than $\varepsilon\simeq0.65$, the dimensionless
mobility becomes independent of the Carreau number and the mobility function
exhibits power-law characteristics as a result of high shear rates at the pore
scale. We derive a suitable criterion for determining the flow regime and the
transition from a constant viscosity Newtonian response to a power-law regime
in terms of a new Carreau number rescaled with a dimensionless function which
incorporates the medium porosity and the arrangement of fibers.
