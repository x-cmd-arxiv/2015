EMEA parallel text corpora and not related OPUS Open Subtitles project were
used as the ground for creation of phrase tables and different language models
including the development, tuning and testing of these translation systems. The
BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER metrics have been used in order to evaluate the
results of various systems. Our experiments deal with the systems that include
POS tagging, factored phrase models, hierarchical models, syntactic taggers,
and other alignment methods. We also executed a deep analysis of Polish data as
preparatory work before automatized data processing such as true casing or
punctuation normalization phase. Normalized metrics was used to compare
results. Scores lower than 15% mean that Machine Translation engine is unable
to provide satisfying quality, scores greater than 30% mean that translations
should be understandable without problems and scores over 50 reflect adequate
translations. The average results of Polish to English translations scores for
BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER were relatively high and ranged from 70,58 to
82,72. The lowest score was 64,38. The average results ranges for English to
Polish translations were little lower (67,58 - 78,97). The real-life
implementations of presented high quality Machine Translation Systems are
anticipated in general medical practice and telemedicine.

  Dense Binary Pixels",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The pursuit of smaller pixel sizes at ever increasing resolution in digital
image sensors is mainly driven by the stringent price and form-factor
requirements of sensors and optics in the cellular phone market. Recently, Eric
Fossum proposed a novel concept of an image sensor with dense sub-diffraction
limit one-bit pixels jots, which can be considered a digital emulation of
silver halide photographic film. This idea has been recently embodied as the
EPFL Gigavision camera. A major bottleneck in the design of such sensors is the
image reconstruction process, producing a continuous high dynamic range image
from oversampled binary measurements. The extreme quantization of the Poisson
statistics is incompatible with the assumptions of most standard image
processing and enhancement frameworks. The recently proposed maximum-likelihood
(ML) approach addresses this difficulty, but suffers from image artifacts and
has impractically high computational complexity. In this work, we study a
variant of a sensor with binary threshold pixels and propose a reconstruction
algorithm combining an ML data fitting term with a sparse synthesis prior. We
also show an efficient hardware-friendly real-time approximation of this
inverse operator.Promising results are shown on synthetic data as well as on
HDR data emulated using multiple exposures of a regular CMOS sensor.

so far provided natural explanations for these signals, the ETI hypothesis is

to vanishing gradients, in which the gradients used by back-propagation are
extremely large for weights connecting deep layers (layers near the output

results in slow learning in the shallow layers. Additionally, it has also been
shown that in highly non-convex problems, such as deep neural networks, there

low curvature points. This enables us to speed up learning in the shallow

brightness profile: an inner optically thick region, which behaves as a
pseudo-photosphere with a wavelength-dependent size, and an optically thin
tenuous outer part, which contributes with about a third of the total flux. The
isophotal shape of the surface brightness is well described by elliptical
contours with an axial ratio $b/a=\cos i$ for inclinations $i<75^{\circ}$.
Based on these properties, a semi-analytical model was developed to describe
the continuum emission of gaseous discs. It provides fluxes and spectral slopes
at the infrared within an accuracy of $10\%$ and $5\%$, respectively, when
compared to the numerical results. The model indicates that the infrared
spectral slope is mainly determined by both the density radial slope and the
disc flaring exponent, being practically independent of disc inclination and
base density. As a first application, the density structure of 15 Be stars was

another given tree. The problem is of fundamental importance and has been
studied since the 1960s. For some variants, e.g., ordered trees, near-linear
time algorithms are known, but for the general case truly subquadratic
algorithms remain elusive.
  Our first result is a reduction from the Orthogonal Vectors problem to
Subtree Isomorphism, showing that a truly subquadratic algorithm for the latter
refutes the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).
  In light of this conditional lower bound, we focus on natural special cases
for which no truly subquadratic algorithms are known. We classify these cases
against the quadratic barrier, showing in particular that:
  -- Even for binary, rooted trees, a truly subquadratic algorithm refutes
SETH.
  -- Even for rooted trees of depth $O(\log\log{n})$, where $n$ is the total
number of vertices, a truly subquadratic algorithm refutes SETH.
  -- For every constant $d$, there is a constant $\epsilon_d>0$ and a
randomized, truly subquadratic algorithm for degree-$d$ rooted trees of depth
at most $(1+ \epsilon_d) \log_{d}{n}$. In particular, there is an $O(\min\{
2.85^h ,n^2 \})$ algorithm for binary trees of depth $h$.
  Our reductions utilize new ""tree gadgets"" that are likely useful for future
SETH-based lower bounds for problems on trees. Our upper bounds apply a
folklore result from randomized decision tree complexity.

NuSTAR detects four non-thermal X-ray filaments, extending the detection of

morphological and spectral study of the filaments suggests that their origin
may be heterogeneous, where previous studies suggested a common origin in young

spatially correlated with the 6.4 keV Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line emission
associated with two Sgr A molecular clouds: MC1 and the Bridge. Broad-band
X-ray spectral analysis with a Monte-Carlo based X-ray reflection model
self-consistently determined their intrinsic column density ($\sim10^{23}$

we compare two indirect methods of updating namely, the Adaptive Metropolis
Hastings and a newly applied algorithm called Monte Carlo Dynamically Weighted
Importance Sampling (MCDWIS). The approximation of a posterior predictive
distribution is based on Bayesian inference of continuous multivariate Gaussian
probability density functions, defining the variability of physical properties
affected by forced vibration. The motivation behind applying MCDWIS is in the
complexity of computing normalizing constants in higher dimensional or
multimodal systems. The MCDWIS accounts for this intractability by analytically
computing importance sampling estimates at each time step of the algorithm. In
addition, a dynamic weighting step with an Adaptive Pruned Enriched Population
Control Scheme (APEPCS) allows for further control over weighted samples and
population size. The performance of the MCDWIS simulation is graphically

solar corona based on surface measurements. The extrapolations assume that the
ratio of internal energy of the plasma to magnetic energy, the plasma-beta is
negligible. Despite the widespread use of this assumption observations, models,
and theoretical considerations show that beta is of the order of a few percent
to more than 10%, and thus not small. We investigate what consequences this has
for the reliability of extrapolation results. We use basic concepts starting
with the force and the energy balance to infer relations between plasma-beta
and free magnetic energy, to study the direction of currents in the corona with
respect to the magnetic field, and to estimate the errors in the free magnetic
energy by neglecting effects of the plasma (beta<<1). A comparison with a 3D
MHD model supports our basic considerations. If plasma-beta is of the order of
the relative free energy (the ratio of the free magnetic energy to the total
magnetic energy) then the pressure gradient can balance the Lorentz force. This
is the case in the solar corona, and therefore the currents are not properly
described. In particular the error in terms of magnetic energy by neglecting
the plasma is of the order of the free magnetic energy, so that the latter can
not be reliably determined by an extrapolation. While a force-free
extrapolation might capture the magnetic structure and connectivity of the
coronal magnetic field, the derived currents and free magnetic energy are not
reliable. Thus quantitative results of extrapolations on the location and
amount of heating in the corona (through current dissipation) and on the energy
storage of the magnetic field (e.g. for eruptive events) are limited.

calculated for a grid of supernovae resulting from massive stars with solar

followed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel
aspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model
for the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the
observed energy for SN 1987A, using several standard progenitors, and for the
Crab supernova using a 9.6 solar mass progenitor. As a result of using a
calibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is
variable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star. Many
progenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black
holes, and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set.
The resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that
a reasonable contribution from Type Ia supernovae is also allowed, but with a
deficiency of light s-process isotopes. The resulting neutron star IMF has a
mean gravitational mass near 1.4 solar masses. The average black hole mass is
about 9 solar masses if only the helium core implodes, and 14 solar masses if
the entire presupernova star collapses. Only ~10% of supernovae come from stars
over 20 solar masses and some of these are Type Ib or Ic. Some useful
systematics of Type IIp light curves are explored.

upon visual inspection of the image, but such apparent structure may either
correspond to true features in the source or be due to noise in the data. This
paper presents a method for testing whether inferred structure in an image with
Poisson noise represents a significant departure from a baseline (null) model
of the image. To infer image structure, we conduct a Bayesian analysis of a
full model that uses a multiscale component to allow flexible departures from
the posited null model. As a test statistic, we use a tail probability of the
posterior distribution under the full model. This choice of test statistic
allows us to estimate a computationally efficient upper bound on a p-value that
enables us to draw strong conclusions even when there are limited computational
resources that can be devoted to simulations under the null model. We
demonstrate the statistical performance of our method on simulated images.
Applying our method to an X-ray image of the quasar 0730+257, we find
significant evidence against the null model of a single point source and
uniform background, lending support to the claim of an X-ray jet.

independent Brownian paths in $\mathbb R^d$ interacting through a mutual
self-attraction. This is expressed by the Hamiltonian $\int\int_{\mathbb
R^{2d}} V(x-y) \mu(d x)\nu(d y)$ with two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$

will be interested in class of potentials $V$ which are {\it{singular}}, e.g.,

  The mutual interaction of the Brownian paths inspires a compactification of
the quotient space of orbits of product measures, which is structurally
different from the self-interacting case introduced in \cite{MV14}, owing to
the lack of shift-invariant structure in the mutual interaction. We prove a
{\it{strong large deviation principle}} for the product measures of two
Brownian occupation measures in such a compactification, and derive asymptotic
path behavior under Gibbs measures on Wiener paths arising from mutually
attracting singular interactions. For the spatially smoothened parabolic
Anderson model with white noise potential, our analysis allows a direct

physical situations for the magnetic field within the shell of the nebula. The
first assumes that there is an increase in the magnetic field strength and
plasma density at the outer radius of the HII region, such as would be produced

  Revised version, especially improving on the experiments in Section 9",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-Pivot Quicksort refers to variants of classical quicksort where in the
partitioning step $k$ pivots are used to split the input into $k + 1$ segments.
For many years, multi-pivot quicksort was regarded as impractical, but in 2009
a 2-pivot approach by Yaroslavskiy, Bentley, and Bloch was chosen as the
standard sorting algorithm in Sun's Java 7. In 2014 at ALENEX, Kushagra et al.
introduced an even faster algorithm that uses three pivots. This paper studies
what possible advantages multi-pivot quicksort might offer in general. The
contributions are as follows: Natural comparison-optimal algorithms for
multi-pivot quicksort are devised and analyzed. The analysis shows that the
benefits of using multiple pivots with respect to the average comparison count
are marginal and these strategies are inferior to simpler strategies such as
the well known median-of-$k$ approach. A substantial part of the partitioning
cost is caused by rearranging elements. A rigorous analysis of an algorithm for
rearranging elements in the partitioning step is carried out, observing mainly
how often array cells are accessed during partitioning. The algorithm behaves
best if 3 to 5 pivots are used. Experiments show that this translates into good
cache behavior and is closest to predicting observed running times of
multi-pivot quicksort algorithms. Finally, it is studied how choosing pivots
from a sample affects sorting cost. The study is theoretical in the sense that
although the findings motivate design recommendations for multipivot quicksort
algorithms that lead to running time improvements over known algorithms in an
experimental setting, these improvements are small.

degrees of the IBEX Ribbon ISMF direction. Stars tracing B_pol have the same
mean distance as stars that do not trace B_pol, but show weaker polarizations
consistent with lower column densities of polarizing grains. The variations in
the polarization position angle directions indicate a low level of magnetic
turbulence. B_pol is found after excluding polarizations that trace a separate
magnetic structure that apparently is due to interstellar dust deflected around
the heliosphere. Local interstellar cloud velocities relative to the LSR
increase with the angles between the LSR velocities and ISMF, indicating that
the kinematics of local interstellar material is ordered by the ISMF.
Polarization and color excess data are consistent with an extension of Loop I
to the solar vicinity. Polarizations are consistent with previous findings of
more efficient grain alignment in low column density sightlines. Optical
polarization and color excess data indicate the presence of nearby interstellar
dust in the BICEP2 field. Color excess E(B-V) indicates an optical extinction

problem of correctly identifying a quantum state, given the knowledge that it
is one of two specific states ($\rho$ or $\sigma$). It was originally derived
in the asymptotic i.i.d. setting, in which arbitrarily many (say, $n$)
identical copies of the state ($\rho^{\otimes n}$ or $\sigma^{\otimes n}$) are
considered to be available. In this setting, the lemma states that, for any
given upper bound on the probability $\alpha_n$ of erroneously inferring the
state to be $\sigma$, the probability $\beta_n$ of erroneously inferring the
state to be $\rho$ decays exponentially in $n$, with the rate of decay
converging to the relative entropy of the two states. The second order
asymptotics for quantum hypothesis testing, which establishes the speed of
convergence of this rate of decay to its limiting value, was derived in the
i.i.d. setting independently by Tomamichel and Hayashi, and Li. We extend this
result to settings beyond i.i.d.. Examples of these include Gibbs states of
quantum spin systems (with finite-range, translation-invariant interactions) at
high temperatures.

Jupiters appears to be correlated with the planets' surface gravity. One of the
possible explanations is based on the presence of condensations of planetary
evaporated material located in a circumstellar cloud that absorbs the CaII H&K
and MgII h&k resonance line emission flux, used to measure chromospheric
activity. A larger column density in the condensations, or equivalently a
stronger absorption in the chromospheric lines, is obtained when the
evaporation rate of the planet is larger, which occurs for a lower gravity of
the planet. We analyze here a sample of stars hosting transiting hot Jupiters
tuned in order to minimize systematic effects (e.g., interstellar medium
absorption). Using a mixture model, we find that the data are best fit by a
two-linear-regression model. We interpret this result in terms of the
Vaughan-Preston gap. We use a Monte Carlo approach to best take into account
the uncertainties, finding that the two intercepts fit the observed peaks of
the distribution of logR'HK for main-sequence solar-like stars. We also find
that the intercepts are correlated with the slopes, as predicted by the model
based on the condensations of planetary evaporated material. Our findings bring
further support to this model, although we cannot firmly exclude different
explanations. A precise determination of the slopes of the two linear
components would allow one to estimate the average effective stellar flux
powering planetary evaporation, which can then be used for theoretical
population and evolution studies of close-in planets.

interacts with the Standard Model lepton fields at the renormalizable level. We
allow for a general coupling matrix between the dark matter and leptons whose
structure is beyond the one permitted by the minimal flavor violation (MFV)
assumption. It is assumed that this is the only new source of flavor violation
in addition to the Standard Model (SM) Yukawa interactions. The setup can be
described by augmenting the SM flavor symmetry by an additional
$\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\chi}$, under which the dark matter $\chi$ transforms. This
framework is especially phenomenologically rich, due to possible novel
flavor-changing interactions which are not present within the more restrictive
MFV framework. As a representative case study of this setting, which we call
""beyond MFV"" (BMFV), we consider Dirac fermion dark matter which transforms as
a singlet under the SM gauge group and a triplet under $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\chi}$.
The DM fermion couples to the SM lepton sector through a scalar mediator
$\phi$. Unlike the case of quark-flavored DM, we show that there is no
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry within either the MFV or BMFV settings which
automatically stabilizes the lepton-flavored DM. We discuss constraints on this
setup from flavor-changing processes, DM relic abundance as well as direct and
indirect detections. We find that relatively large flavor-changing couplings
are possible, while the dark matter mass is still within the phenomenologically
interesting region below the TeV scale. Collider signatures which can be
potentially searched for at the lepton and hadron colliders are discussed.
Finally, we discuss the implications for decaying dark matter, which can appear
if an additional stabilizing symmetry is not imposed.

problems are efficiently solvable in our physical world. This motivates the
general study of how physical principles bound computational power. In this
paper we show that some of the essential machinery of quantum computation --
namely reversible controlled transformations and the phase kick-back mechanism
-- exist in any operational-defined theory with a consistent notion of
information. These results provide the tools for an exploration of the physics
underpinning the structure of computational algorithms. We use these results to
investigate the relationship between interference behaviour and computational
power, demonstrating that non-trivial interference behaviour is a general
resource for post-classical computation. In proving the above, we connect
post-quantum interference -- the higher-order interference of Sorkin -- to the
existence of post-quantum particle types, potentially providing a novel
experimental test for higher-order interference. Finally, we conjecture that
theories with post-quantum interference can solve problems intractable even on
a quantum computer.

the updated QSO emissivity and star formation history for the escape fraction
(f_esc) of hydrogen ionizing photons from galaxies. We estimate the f_esc that
is required to reionize the Universe and to maintain the ionization state of
the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization era. At z>5.5, we show that a
constant f_esc of 0.14 to 0.22 is sufficient to reionize the Universe. At
z<3.5, consistent with various observations, we find that f_esc can have values
from 0 to 0.05. However, a steep rise in f_esc, of at least a factor of ~3, is
required between z=3.5 to 5.5. It results from a rapidly decreasing QSO
emissivity at z>3 together with a nearly constant measured H I photoionization
rates at 3<z<5. We show that, this requirement of a steep rise in f_esc over a
very short time can be relaxed if we consider the contribution from a recently
found large number density of faint QSOs at z>4. In addition, a simple
extrapolation of the contribution of such QSOs to high-z suggests that QSOs
alone can reionize the Universe. This implies, at z>3.5, that either the
properties of galaxies should evolve rapidly to increase the f_esc or most of
the low-mass galaxies should host massive black holes and sustain accretion
over a prolonged period. These results motivate a careful investigation of
theoretical predictions of these alternate scenarios that can be distinguished
using future observations. Moreover, it is also very important to revisit the
measurements of H I photoionization rates that are crucial to the analysis
presented here.

advantages over classical theory. One approach to uncovering the source of
these advantages is to determine how computation and communication power vary
as quantum theory is replaced by other operationally-defined theories from a
broad framework of such theories. Such investigations may reveal some of the
key physical features required for powerful computation and communication. In
this paper we investigate how simple physical principles bound the power of two
different computational paradigms which combine computation and communication
in a non-trivial fashion: computation with advice and interactive proof
systems. We show that the existence of non-trivial dynamics in a theory implies
a bound on the power of computation with advice. Moreover, we provide an
explicit example of a theory with no non-trivial dynamics in which the power of
computation with advice is unbounded. Finally we show that the power of simple
interactive proof systems in theories where local measurements suffice for
tomography is non-trivially bounded. This result provides a proof that QMA is
contained in PP which does not make use of any uniquely quantum structure -
such as the fact that observables correspond to self-adjoint operators - and
thus may be of independent interest.

boundary, but the converse is, generically, not true. Regarding AdS as a
gravitational box, we consider vanishing energy flux (VEF) BCs as a more
fundamental physical requirement and we show that these BCs can lead to a new

Kerr-AdS black holes in the Teukolsky formalism, but our formulation applies
also for other spin fields. Imposing VEF BCs, we find a set of two Robin BCs,

theory is established based on spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries by treating
the gravitational force on the same footing as the electroweak and strong
forces. A bi-frame space-time is initiated to describe the laws of nature. One
frame space-time is a globally flat coordinate Minkowski space-time that acts
as an inertial reference frame for the motions of fields, the other is a
locally flat non-coordinate Gravifield space-time that functions as an
interaction representation frame for the degrees of freedom of fields. The
Gravifield is sided on both the globally flat coordinate space-time and locally
flat non-coordinate space-time and characterizes the gravitational force.
Instead of the principle of general coordinate invariance in Einstein theory of
general relativity, some underlying principles with the postulates of
coordinate independence and gauge invariance are motivated to establish the
theory of quantum gravity. When transmuting the Gravifield basis into the
coordinate basis in Minkowski space-time, it enables us to obtain equations of
motion for all quantum fields and derive basic conservation laws for all
symmetries. When the spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries are broken down to a
background structure that possesses the global Lorentz and scaling symmetries,
we arrive at a Lorentz invariant and conformally flat background Gravifield
space-time that is characterized by a cosmic vector with a non-zero
cosmological mass scale. We also obtain the massless graviton and massive
spinnon. We show a mechanism for quantum inflation caused by the quantum loop
contributions. The Einstein theory of general relativity is expected to be an
effective low energy theory. Two types of gravity equation are resulted.

Small number of very large crystals appear for precipitant concentrations
varied over orders of magnitude ~0.003-0.3M; for some proteins, crystals appear
even without addition of any precipitant, not seen with any other heterogeneous

  We find that the mean time to first completion of a maximum-sized cluster may

highlight how the higher statistic (variance, distribution) of the first

maximum cluster) from data. And last but not least, we present a framework to
quantify the formation of cluster of macroscopic size, whose formation is
(asymptotically) very unlikely and occurs as a large deviation phenomenon from
the mean-field limit. We argue that this framework is suitable to describe
phase transition phenomena, as inherent infrequent stochastic processes, in

different redundancy strategies, for eg. number of replicas, and the time when
they are issued and canceled, affect the latency and computing cost. We get the
insight that the log-concavity of the service time distribution is a key factor
in determining whether adding redundancy reduces latency and cost. If the
service distribution is log-convex, then adding maximum redundancy reduces both
latency and cost. And if it is log-concave, then having fewer replicas and

automatic generation of medical billing codes from electronic health records,
generally assign each code independently of the others. They may thus assign
codes for closely related procedures or diagnoses to the same document, even
when they do not tend to occur together in practice, simply because the right
choice can be difficult to infer from the clinical narrative.
  Materials and Methods. We propose a method that injects awareness of the
propensities for code co-occurrence into this process. First, a model is
trained to estimate the conditional probability that one code is assigned by a
human coder, given than another code is known to have been assigned to the same
document. Then, at runtime, an iterative algorithm is used to apply this model
to the output of an existing statistical auto-coder to modify the confidence
scores of the codes.
  Results. We tested this method in combination with a primary auto-coder for
ICD-10 procedure codes, achieving a 12% relative improvement in F-score over
the primary auto-coder baseline.
  Discussion. The proposed method can be used, with appropriate features, in
combination with any auto-coder that generates codes with different levels of
confidence.
  Conclusion. The promising results obtained for ICD-10 procedure codes suggest
that the proposed method may have wider applications in auto-coding.

brief introduction to the general problem of causal inference, and go on to
discuss estimation and inference for causal effects under semiparametric
models, which allow parts of the data-generating process to be unrestricted if
they are not of particular interest (i.e., nuisance functions). These models
are very useful in causal problems because the outcome process is often complex
and difficult to model, and there may only be information available about the
treatment process (at best). Semiparametric theory gives a framework for
benchmarking efficiency and constructing estimators in such settings. In the
second part of the paper we discuss empirical process theory, which provides
powerful tools for understanding the asymptotic behavior of semiparametric
estimators that depend on flexible nonparametric estimators of nuisance
functions. These tools are crucial for incorporating machine learning and other
modern methods into causal inference analyses. We conclude by examining related

in star formation models, because it controls the amplitude and distribution of
density fluctuations. The relation between the compressive ratio (the ratio of
powers in compressive and solenoidal motions) and the statistics of turbulence
has been previously studied systematically only in idealized simulations with
random external forces. In this work, we analyze a simulation of large-scale
turbulence (250 pc) driven by supernova (SN) explosions that has been shown to
yield realistic MC properties. We demonstrate that SN driving results in MC
turbulence with a broad lognormal distribution of the compressive ratio, with a
mean value $\approx 0.3$, lower than the equilibrium value of $\approx 0.5$
found in the inertial range of isothermal simulations with random solenoidal
driving. We also find that the compressibility of the turbulence is not
noticeably affected by gravity, nor are the mean cloud radial (expansion or
contraction) and solid-body rotation velocities. Furthermore, the clouds follow
a general relation between the rms density and the rms Mach number similar to
that of supersonic isothermal turbulence, though with a large scatter, and
their average gas density PDF is described well by a lognormal distribution,
with the addition of a high-density power-law tail when self-gravity is
included.

use a Monte Carlo simulation of planetary systems to investigate sources of
bias in determining the mass-radius distribution of exoplanets for the two
primary techniques used to measure planetary masses---Radial Velocities (RVs)
and Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). We assert that mass measurements derived
from these two methods are comparably reliable---as the physics underlying
their respective signals is well understood. Nevertheless, their sensitivity to
planet mass varies with the properties of the planets themselves. We find that
for a given planet size, the RV method tends to find planets with higher mass
while the sensitivity of TTVs is more uniform. This ``sensitivity bias''
implies that a complete census of TTV systems is likely to yield a more robust
estimate of the mass-radius distribution provided there are not important
physical differences between planets near and far from mean-motion resonance.
We discuss differences in the sensitivity of the two methods with orbital
period and system architecture, which may compound the discrepancies between
them (e.g., short period planets detectable by RVs may be more dense due to
atmospheric loss). We advocate for continued mass measurements using both
approaches as a means both to measure the masses of more planets and to
identify potential differences in planet structure that may result from their
dynamical and environmental histories.

model for NGC300 to build a bridge between its SFH and its observed data,
especially the present-day radial profiles and global observed properties

comparing the model predictions with the corresponding observations, we adopt
the classical $\chi^{2}$ methodology to find out the best combination of free

inside-out formation scenario and an appropriate outflow rate, our model
reproduces well most of the present-day observational values, not only the

results suggest that NGC300 may experience a rapid growth of its disk. Through
comparing the best-fitting model predicted SFH of NGC300 with that of M33, we
find that the mean stellar age of NGC300 is older than that of M33 and there is
a lack of primordial gas infall onto the disk of NGC300 recently. Our results

loss through the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) method. The path loss is a major
component which determines the QoS of a wireless link. Its effect is
complemented by the presence of obstruction between the transmitter and
receiver. The future cellular network (5G) focuses on operating with the
millimeter-wave (mmW). In higher frequency, path loss can play a significant
role in degrading the link quality due to higher attenuation. In a scenario,
where the operating environment is changing dynamically, sudden degradation of
operating conditions or arrival of obstruction between transmitter and receiver
may result in link failure. The method analyzed here includes dynamically
allocating spectrum at a lower frequency band for a link suffering from high
path loss. For the analysis, a wireless link was set up using Universal
Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs). The received power is observed to increase
by dynamically changing the operating frequency from 1.9 GHz to 830 MHz.
Finally the utility of software defined radio (SDR) in the RF front end, to
combat the path loss in the future cellular networks, is studied.

invariance from the Yang--Mills--Higgs model in noncommutative geometry (NCG).
In the ordinary context of the NCG, the {\it distance matrix} $M_{nm}$ which
corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of Higgs fields is taken to be
finite. However, since $M_{nm}$ is arbitrary in this formulation, we can take
all $M_{nm}$ to be zero. In the original composite scheme, the Higgs field
itself vanishes with the condition $M_{nm} = 0$. Then, we adopt the elemental
scheme, in which the gauge and the Higgs bosons are regarded as elemental
fields. By these assumptions, all scalars do not have vevs at tree level. The
symmetry breaking mechanism will be implemented by the Coleman--Weinberg
mechanism.
  As a result, we show a possibility to solve the hierarchy problem in the
context of NCG. Unfortunately, the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism does not work in
the SM Higgs sector, because the Coleman--Weinberg effective potential becomes
unbounded from below for $m_{t} > m_{Z}$. However, viable models can be
possible by proper extensions.

the amplitude of the sound as a function of time is given based on a few
parameters quantifying the time evolution of mouth pressure. As in previous
uses of this model, the predictions are expected to be qualitatively consistent
with simulations using the Raman model, and observations of real instruments.
Model simulations for slowly variable parameters require very high precisions
of computation. Similarly, any real system, even if close to the model would be
affected by noise. In order to describe the influence of noise, a modified
model is developed that includes a stochastic variation of the parameters. Both
ideal and stochastic models are shown to attain a minimal amplitude at the
static oscillation threshold. Beyond this point, the amplitude of the
oscillations increases exponentially, although some time is required before the
oscillations can be observed at the '' dynamic oscillation threshold ''. The
effect of a sudden interruption of the growth of the mouth pressure is also
studied, showing that it usually triggers a faster growth of the oscillations.

insertion or deletion of a solution. Generally the solution to this problem
requires to perform the complete non-dominated sorting which is too expensive
in terms of number of comparisons. Recently an Efficient Non-domination Level
Update (ENLU) approach is proposed which does not perform the complete sorting.
For this purpose, in this paper a space efficient version of ENLU approach is
proposed without compromising the number of comparisons. However this approach
does not work satisfactorily in all the cases. So we have also proposed another
tree based approach for solving this non-domination level update problem. In
case of insertion, the tree based approach always checks for same number of
fronts unlike linear approach in which the number of fronts to be checked
depends on the inserted solution. The result shows that in case where all the
solutions are dominating in nature the maximum number of comparisons using tree
based approach is $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ as opposed to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ in ENLU
approach. When all the solutions are equally divided into $K$ fronts such that
each solution in a front is dominated by all the solutions in the previous
front then the maximum number of comparisons to find a deleted solution in case
of tree based approach is $K{-}\log K$ less than that of ENLU approach. Using
these approaches an on-line sorting algorithm is also proposed and the
competitive analysis of this algorithm is also presented.

standard way of predicting the existence or coexistence of hidden attractors in
a system. In this plenary survey lecture the concept of self-excited and hidden
attractors is discussed, and various corresponding examples of self-excited and
hidden attractors are considered.

present paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a
history of how the laser was invented. Rather, it addresses the question: what
are the fundamental features that distinguish laser light from thermal light?
The obvious answer, ""laser light is coherent"", is, I argue, so vague that it
must be put aside at the start, albeit to revisit later. A more specific,
quantum theoretic, version, ""laser light is in a coherent state"", is simply
wrong in this context: both laser light and thermal light can equally well be
described by coherent states, with amplitudes that vary stochastically in
space. Instead, my answer to the titular question is that four principles are
needed: high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable
intensity. Combining the first three of these principles suffices to show, in a
quantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up
to $\sim10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a
light bulb. This quantitative analysis is quite simple, and is easily relatable
to ""coherence"", yet is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to
my knowledge. The fourth principle is the most subtle and, perhaps
surprisingly, is the only one related to coherent states in the quantum optics
sense: it implies that the description in terms of coherent states is the only
simple description of a laser beam. Interestingly, this leads to the (not, as
it turns out, entirely new) prediction that narrowly filtered laser beams are
indistinguishable from similarly filtered thermal beams. I hope that other
educators find this material useful, it may contain surprises even for
researchers who have been in the field longer than I have.

explicit methods for coupling the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and

such as a body with a protrusion - they become unstable. We present an implicit
formulation of the coupling between rigid body dynamics and fluid dynamics

previous work on this method, the resulting matrix equation in the present
approach is solved using a block-LU decomposition. Each step of the block-LU
decomposition is modified to incorporate the rigid body dynamics. We show that
our method achieves second-order accuracy in space and first-order in time
(third-order for practical settings), only with a small additional
computational cost to the original method. Our implicit coupling yields stable
solution for density ratios as low as $10^{-4}$. We also consider the influence
of fictitious fluid located inside the rigid bodies on the accuracy and

isomorphism concerning regular functions on the jet space and on the unipotent

that in the sense of differential systems, after restricting one independent
variable to a constant the Toda field theory becomes the system for integral

we establish that, in terms of differential invariants, the Toda field theory
is the quotient of the product of two such systems by a natural group action.

very rare at high redshift as we found only a few comparable systems in

hosted in collapsed halos with $M_{\rm vir}=10^{13.4}-10^{14.0}~M_{\odot}$ and
evolve into the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of the most massive clusters

be a proto-BCG in the multiple merger phase. The observed total stellar mass of
the group is $5.8^{+5.1}_{-2.0}\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$. It suggests that over

analysis in undirected networks. The key idea of that framework is to sample a
network by a symmetric bivariate distribution and then use that bivariate
distribution to formerly define various notions, including centrality, relative
centrality, community, and modularity. The main objective of this paper is to
extend the probabilistic framework to directed networks, where the sampling
bivariate distributions could be asymmetric. Our main finding is that we can
relax the assumption from symmetric bivariate distributions to bivariate
distributions that have the same marginal distributions. By using such a weaker
assumption, we show that various notions for structural analysis in directed
networks can also be defined in the same manner as before. However, since the
bivariate distribution could be asymmetric, the community detection algorithms
proposed in our previous work cannot be directly applied. For this, we show
that one can construct another sampled graph with a symmetric bivariate
distribution so that for any partition of the network, the modularity index
remains the same as that of the original sampled graph. Based on this, we
propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm that returns a partition of
communities when the algorithm converges.

the companion paper by Swaczyna et al 2015. We analyzed the entire data set
together and the yearly subsets, and found the temperature and velocity vector
of ISN~He in front of the heliosphere. As seen in the previous studies, the
allowable parameters are highly correlated and form a four-dimensional tube in
the parameter space. The inflow longitudes obtained from the yearly data
subsets show a spread of ~6 degree, with the other parameters varying
accordingly along the parameter tube, and the minimum chi-square value is
larger than expected. We found, however, that the Mach number of the ISN~He
flow shows very little scatter and is thus very tightly constrained. It is in
excellent agreement with the original analysis of ISN~He observations from IBEX
and recent reanalyses of observations from Ulysses. We identify a possible
inaccuracy in the Warm Breeze parameters as the likely cause of the scatter in
the ISN~He parameters obtained from the yearly subsets, and we suppose that
another component may exist in the signal, or a process that is not accounted
for in the current physical model of ISN~He in front of the heliosphere. From
our analysis, the inflow velocity vector, temperature, and Mach number of the

functions is developed, with attention for computational results for their
Fourier transform, Funk and Radon transform, and scaling operations. The
Fourier transform of generalized 3D Zernike functions shows less oscillatory
behaviour and more rapid decay at infinity, compared to the standard case
$\alpha=0$, when the smoothness parameter $\alpha$ is increased beyond 0. The
3D generalized Zernike functions can be used to expand smooth functions,
supported by the unit ball and vanishing at the rim and the origin of the unit
ball, whose radial and angular dependence is separated. Particular instances of
the latter functions (prewavelets) yield, via the Funk transform and the
Fourier transform, an anisotropic function that can be used for a band-limited
line-detecting wavelet transform, appropriate for analysis of 3D medical data
containing elongated structures. We present instances of prewavelets, with
relevant radial functions, that allow analytic computation of Funk and Fourier
transform. A key step here is to identify the special form that is assumed by
the expansion coefficients of a separable function on the unit ball with

vitiated by the population changes. The Gini of aggregated units A and B will
be higher than those of A and B computed separately. This effect becomes more
acute with fatness of tails. When the sample size is smaller than entire

coefficients cannot be trusted and comparing countries of different sizes makes
no sense; nor does it make sense to make claims of ""changes in inequality""

this work are to characterize these new observations of the C II lines, place
them in context with previous work, and to identify any additional value the C
II lines bring when compared with other spectral lines. We make use of wide,
long exposure IRIS rasters covering the quiet Sun and an active region. Line
properties such as velocity shift and width are extracted from individual
spectra and analyzed. The lines have a variety of shapes (mostly single-peak or
double-peak), are strongest in active regions and weaker in the quiet Sun. The
ratio between the 133.4 nm and 133.5 nm components is always less than 1.8,
indicating that their radiation is optically thick in all locations. Maps of
the C II line widths are a powerful new diagnostic of chromospheric structures,
and their line shifts are a robust velocity diagnostic. Compared with earlier
quiet Sun observations, we find similar absolute intensities and mean line
widths, but smaller red shifts; this difference can perhaps be attributed to
differences in spectral resolution and spatial coverage. The C II intensity
maps are somewhat similar to those of transition region lines, but also share
some features with chromospheric maps such as those from the Mg II k line,
indicating that they are formed between the upper chromosphere and transition
region. C II intensity, width, and velocity maps can therefore be used to
gather additional information about the upper chromosphere.

al., Phys. Rev. E 90, 032104 (2014)] for which non-negative biased noise
$\eta(t)$ in the form of generalized white Poissonian noise can induce
anomalous transport processes similar to those generated by a deterministic
constant force $F=\langle \eta(t) \rangle $ but significantly more effective
than $F$, i.e. the particle moves much faster, the velocity fluctuations are
noticeable reduced and the transport efficiency is enhanced several times.
Here, we confirm this result for the case of dichotomous fluctuations which in
contrast to white Poissonian noise can assume positive as well as negative
values and examine the role of thermal noise in the observed phenomenon. We
focus our attention on the impact of bidirectionality of dichotomous
fluctuations and reveal that the effect of non-equilibrium noise enhanced

occurring in strongly fluctuating environments of both a physical and

a set-up that consists of a resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson

the system into such a Zeno subspace in an unconventional way: by Raman-like
transitions via virtual intermediate states outside this subspace, which are
not forbidden. Here, we extend this concept into the realm of non-Hermitian
dynamics by showing that the stochastic competition between measurement and a

obtain an analytic solution for ultracold bosons in a lattice and show that a
dark state of the tunnelling operator is a steady state in which the
observable's fluctuations are zero and tunnelling is suppressed by destructive

benefits in applications such as visual quality inspection and rectangle
detection.

  Levels for Database Applications","IEEE 2-column format",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the allocation of Virtual Arrays (VAs) in a Heterogeneous Disk
Array (HDA). Each VA holds groups of related objects and datasets such as
files, relational tables, which has similar performance and availability
characteristics. We evaluate single-pass data allocation methods for HDA using
a synthetic stream of allocation requests, where each VA is characterized by
its RAID level, disk loads and space requirements. The goal is to maximize the
number of allocated VAs and maintain high disk bandwidth and capacity
utilization, while balancing disk loads. Although only RAID1 (basic mirroring)
and RAID5 (rotated parity arrays) are considered in the experimental study, we
develop the analysis required to estimate disk loads for other RAID levels.
Since VA loads vary significantly over time, the VA allocation is carried out
at the peak load period, while ensuring that disk bandwidth is not exceeded at
other high load periods. Experimental results with a synthetic stream of
allocation requests show that allocation methods minimizing the maximum disk
bandwidth and capacity utilization or their variance across all disks yield the
maximum number of allocated VAs. HDA saves disk bandwidth, since a single RAID
level accommodating the most stringent availability requirements for a small
subset of objects would incur an unnecessarily high overhead for updating check
blocks or data replicas for all objects. The number of allocated VAs can be
increased by adopting the clustered RAID5 paradigm, which exploits the tradeoff
between redundancy and bandwidth utilization. Since rebuild can be carried out
at the level of individual VAs, prioritizing rebuild of VAs with higher access
rates can improve overall performance.

the analysis of neutral He observed by IBEX that resulted in an unexpected
conclusion that the interstellar neutral He flow vector was different than
previously thought and that a new population of neutral He, dubbed the Warm
Breeze, exists in the heliosphere. It was also used in the reanalysis of
Ulysses observations that confirmed the original findings on the flow vector,
but suggested a significantly higher temperature. The present version model has
two strains targeted for different applications, based on an identical
paradigm, but differing in the implementation and in the treatment of
ionization losses. We present the model in detail and discuss numerous effects
related to the measurement process that potentially modify the resulting flux
of ISN He observed by IBEX, and identify those of them that should not be
omitted in the simulations to avoid biasing the results. This paper is part of
a coordinated series of papers presenting the current state of analysis of

  Accepted for publication in the Annals of Probability",,,,"math.PR cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We identify the ballistically and diffusively rescaled limit distribution of
the second class particle position in a wide range of asymmetric and symmetric
interacting particle systems with established hydrodynamic behavior,
respectively (including zero-range, misanthrope and many other models). The
initial condition is a step profile which, in some classical cases of
asymmetric models, gives rise to a rarefaction fan scenario. We also point out
a model with non-concave, non-convex hydrodynamics, where the rescaled second
class particle distribution has both continuous and discrete counterparts. The
results follow from a substantial generalization of P.A. Ferrari and C. Kipnis'
arguments (""Second class particles in the rarefaction fan"", Ann. Inst. H.
Poincar\'e, 31, 1995) for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. The
main novelty is the introduction of a signed coupling measure as initial data,
which nevertheless results in a proper probability initial distribution for the
site of the second class particle and makes the extension possible. We also
reveal in full generality a very interesting invariance property of the
one-site marginal distribution of the process underneath the second class
particle which in particular proves the intrinsicality of our choice for the
initial distribution. Finally, we give a lower estimate on the probability of
survival of a second class particle-antiparticle pair.

  Transformers",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulink is the de facto industrial standard for designing embedded control
systems. When dealing with the formal verification of Simulink models, we face
the problem of translating the graphical language of Simulink, namely,
hierarchical block diagrams (HBDs), into a formalism suitable for verification.
In this paper, we study the translation of HBDs into the compositional
refinement calculus framework for reactive systems. Specifically, we consider
as target language an algebra of atomic predicate transformers to capture basic
Simulink blocks (both stateless and stateful), composed in series, in parallel,
and in feedback. For a given HBD, there are many possible ways to translate it
into a term in this algebra, with different tradeoffs. We explore these
tradeoffs, and present three translation algorithms. We report on a prototype
implementation of these algorithms in a tool that translates Simulink models
into algebra terms implemented in the Isabelle theorem prover. We test our tool
on several case studies including a benchmark Simulink model by Toyota. We
compare the three translation algorithms, with respect to size and readability
of generated terms, simplifiability of the corresponding formulas, and other
metrics.

Explorer (IBEX) since 2009 with a signal-to-noise ratio well above 1000.
Because of the geometry of the observations, the signal observed from January
to March each year is the easiest to identify. However, as we show via
simulations, the portion of the signal in the range of intensities from 10^{-3}
to 10^{-2} of the peak value, previously mostly left out from the analysis, may
bring important information about the details of the distribution function of
interstellar He gas in front of the heliosphere. In particular, these
observations may inform us about possible departures of the parent interstellar
He population from equilibrium. We compare the expected distribution of the
signal for the canonical assumption of a single Maxwell-Boltzmann population
with the distributions for a superposition of the Maxwell-Boltzmann primary
population and the recently discovered Warm Breeze, and for a single primary
population given by a kappa function. We identify the regions on the sky where
the differences between those cases are expected to be the most visible against
the background. We discuss the diagnostic potential of the fall peak of the
interstellar signal, reduced by a factor of 50 due to the Compton-Getting
effect but still above the detection limit of IBEX. We point out the strong
energy dependence of the fall signal and suggest that searching for this signal
in the data could bring an independent assessment of the low-energy measurement
threshold of the IBEX-Lo sensor.

quantized after a constraint analysis following Dirac's methodology by
determining the Hamiltonian transition amplitude. In particular, the covariant
transition amplitude is established in the generalized non-mixing Lorenz gauge.
The complete Green's functions are obtained through functional methods and the
theory's renormalizability is also detailed presented. Next, the radiative
corrections for the Green's functions at $\alpha $-order are computed; and, as
it turns out, an unexpected $m_{P}$-dependent divergence on the DKP sector of
the theory is found. Furthermore, in order to show the effectiveness of the
renormalization procedure on the present theory, a diagrammatic discussion on
the photon self-energy and vertex part at $\alpha ^{2}$-order are presented,
where it is possible to observe contributions from the DKP self-energy
function, and then analyse whether or not this novel divergence propagates to
higher-order contributions. Lastly, an energy range where the theory is well
defined: $m^{2}\ll k^{2}<m_{p}^{2}$ was also found by evaluating the effective
coupling for the GSDKP.

modulation of the flux that can be associated with the precession of the

initial star orbit is in general inclined with respect to the black hole spin,
this misalignment combined with the Lense-Thirring effect leads to a warp in

Heisenberg antiferromagnet (KHAF) is well established, the discussion of the
effect of an interlayer coupling (ILC) by controlled theoretical approaches is
still lacking. Here we study this problem by using the coupled-cluster method
to high orders of approximation. We consider a stacked KHAF with a
perpendicular ILC $J_\perp$, where we study ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic
$J_\perp$. We find that the spin-liquid ground state (GS) persists until
relatively large strengths of the ILC. Only if the strength of the ILC exceeds
about 15\% of the intralayer coupling the spin-liquid phase gives way for $q=0$
magnetic long-range order, where the transition between both phases is
continuous and the critical strength of the ILC, $|J^c_\perp|$, is almost
independent of the sign of $J_\perp$. Thus, by contrast to the quantum GS
selection of the strictly two-dimensional KHAF at large spin $s$, the ILC leads
first to a selection of the $q=0$ GS. Only at larger $|J_\perp|$ the ILC drives
a first-order transition to the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ long-range ordered GS.
As a result, the stacked spin-1/2 KHAF exhibits a rich GS phase diagram with
two continuous and two discontinuous transitions driven by the ILC.

significantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the random

that the star formation in this cloud is at an early evolutionary phase, before
the presence of any significant ionizing or heating sources. Our findings
indicate that star formation in this cloud may be triggered by a tidal
compression as it approaches pericenter, similar to the case of G0.253+0.016

degeneracy in the Einstein timescale $t_E$, which prevents mass and distance of
the lens to be univocally determined. It has been shown that a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit could provide masses and distances for most standard
planetary events ($t_E \approx 20$ days) via a microlens parallax measurement.
This paper extends the analysis to shorter Einstein timescales, $t_E \approx 1$
day, when dealing with the case of Jupiter-mass lenses. We then study the
capabilities of a low Earth orbit satellite on even shorter timescales, $t_E
\approx 0.1$ days. A Fisher matrix analysis is employed to predict how the
1-$\sigma$ error on parallax depends on $t_E$ and the peak magnification of the
microlensing event. It is shown that a geosynchronous satellite could detect
parallaxes for Jupiter-mass free floaters and discover planetary systems around
very low-mass brown dwarfs. Moreover, a low Earth orbit satellite could lead to
the discovery of Earth-mass free-floating planets. Limitations to these results
can be the strong requirements on the photometry, the effects of blending, and
in the case of the low orbit, the Earth's umbra.

of determinism in biology. He pointed out that DNA determines only a little
part of life phenomena, which are very complex. In fact, organisms determine
the environment and vice versa in a nonlinear way. Very recently,
biophysicists, Shimon Marom and Erez Braun, have demonstrated that controlled
biophysical systems have shown a relative autonomy and flexibility in response
which could not be predicted. Within the boundaries of some restraints, most of
them genetic, this freedom from determinism is well maintained. Marom and Braun
have challenged not only biophysical determinism but also reverse-engineering,
naive reductionism, mechanism, and systems biology.

complex matrices $M_{3}$ has been proposed. By identifying the set of such maps
with a convex set of linear operators on $\mathbb{R}^{8}$, one can employ
techniques from the theory of compact affine semigroups to obtain results
concerning asymptotic properties of positive maps. It turns out that the
idempotent elements play a crucial role in classifying the convex set into
subsets, in which representations of extremal positive maps are to be found. It
has been show that all positive bistochastic maps, extremal in the set of all
positive maps of $M_{3}$, that are not Jordan isomorphisms of $M_3$ are
represented by matrices that fall into two possible categories, determined by
the simplest idempotent matrices: one by the zero matrix, and the other by a
one dimensional orthogonal projection. Some norm conditions for matrices
representing possible extremal maps have been specified and examples of maps
from both categories have been brought up, based on the results published
previously.

their opinions on TLS inspection, a controversial technique that can be used
for both benevolent and malicious purposes. Responses indicate that
participants hold nuanced opinions on security and privacy trade-offs, with
most recognizing legitimate uses for the practice, but also concerned about
threats from hackers or government surveillance. There is strong support for
notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic,
although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern
about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react
negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection
occurring without their knowledge. We also find that there are a small but
significant number of participants who are jaded by the current state of
affairs and have no expectation of privacy.

Particles are monosized hard disks deposited in the container and subjected to

bottom of the silo and the discharge is triggered. After a clogging at the
opening is produced, and equilibrium is restored, the final distribution of the

different behavior as a function of the compaction degree is discussed.

different models depend on the nucleus-nucleus potential chosen or parameters
used to calculate the barrier heights. In this work we plan to develop a
parameterized formula from experimental results obtained from quasi elastic
scattering. Since quasi elastic data spread over Z1Z2=64 to Z1Z2=2460, the
formula is expected to work in the range of low Z1Z2 to high Z1Z2, where Z1, Z2
