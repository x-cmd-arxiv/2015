  Mechanics I","Content added, slightly reformatted. 48 pages, no figures, LaTeX",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wallstrom's criticism of existing formulations of stochastic mechanics is
that they fail to derive the empirical predictions of orthodox quantum
mechanics because they require an ad hoc quantization condition on the
postulated velocity potential, \emph{S}, in order to derive Schr\""odinger wave
functions. We propose an answer to this criticism by modifying the Nelson-Yasue
formulation of non-relativistic stochastic mechanics for a spinless particle
with the following hypothesis: a spinless Nelson-Yasue particle of rest mass
$m$ continuously undergoes a driven steady-state oscillation of
`zitterbewegung' (\emph{zbw}) frequency,
$\omega_{c}=\left(1/\hbar\right)mc^{2}$, in its instantaneous mean forward (and
backward) translational rest frame. With this hypothesis we show that, in the
lab frame, \emph{S} arises from imposing the constraint of conservative
diffusions on the time-symmetrized steady-state phase of the \emph{zbw}
particle, satisfies the required quantization condition, and evolves in time by
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations (when generalized to describe a
statistical ensemble of \emph{zbw} particles). From the mathematical
equivalence of Schr\""odinger's equation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung
equations plus the quantization condition, Schr\""odinger wave functions for a
spinless particle (in and excluding external fields) are thereby recovered. We
also apply this `zitterbewegung stochastic mechanics' (ZSM) to the case of a
central potential and show that it predicts angular momentum quantization. This
paper sets the foundation for Part II, which will (primarily) work out the
many-particle version of ZSM.

IRAM 30-m telescope, which can observe simultaneously at 150 and 260GHz. One of
the main goals of NIKA2 is to measure the pressure distribution in galaxy
clusters at high resolution using the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect. Such
observations have already proved to be an excellent probe of cluster pressure
distributions even at high redshifts. However, an important fraction of
clusters host submm and/or radio point sources, which can significantly affect
the reconstructed signal. Here we report on <20"" resolution observations at 150
and 260GHz of the cluster MACSJ1424, which hosts both radio and submm point
sources. We examine the morphology of the tSZ signal and compare it to other
datasets. The NIKA data are combined with Herschel satellite data to study the
SED of the submm point source contaminants. We then perform a joint
reconstruction of the intracluster medium (ICM) electronic pressure and density
by combining NIKA, Planck, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data, focusing on the impact
of the radio and submm sources on the reconstructed pressure profile. We find
that large-scale pressure distribution is unaffected by the point sources
because of the resolved nature of the NIKA observations. The reconstructed
pressure in the inner region is slightly higher when the contribution of point
sources are removed. We show that it is not possible to set strong constraints
on the central pressure distribution without accurately removing these
contaminants. The comparison with X-ray only data shows good agreement for the
pressure, temperature, and entropy profiles, which all indicate that MACSJ1424
is a dynamically relaxed cool core system. The present observations illustrate
the possibility of measuring these quantities with a relatively small
integration time, even at high redshift and without X-ray spectroscopy.

self-avoiding trails (bond avoiding paths) which may visit a site of the
lattice twice provided the path does not cross itself: to distinguish this
subset of trails we shall call these configurations \emph{grooves}. Three
distinct interactions are added to the configurations: firstly the VISAW
interaction, which is associated with doubly visited sites, secondly a nearest
neighbour interaction in the same fashion as the canonical interacting
self-avoiding walk (ISAW) and thirdly, a stiffness energy to enhance or
decrease the probability of bends in the configuration.
  In addition to the normal high temperature phase we find three low
temperature phases: (i) the usual amorphous liquid drop-like ""globular"" phase,
(ii) an anisotropic ""$\beta$-sheet"" phase with dominant configurations
consisting of aligned long straight segments, which has been found in
semi-flexible nearest neighbour ISAW models, and (iii) a maximally dense phase,
where the all sites of the path are associated with doubly visited sites

seem to meet in the phase space and are always separated by either the extended
or globular phases. We focus attention on the transition between the extended

oscillations of monolayer and bilayer graphenes under crossed electric and

particular on the extension of local Poincar\'e invariance to include
invariance under local changes of scale. We work exclusively in terms of finite
transformations, which allow for a more transparent interpretation of such
theories in terms of gauge fields in Minkowski spacetime. Our approach
therefore differs from the usual geometrical description of locally
scale-invariant Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) and Weyl gauge theory (WGT) in
terms of Riemann--Cartan and Weyl--Cartan spacetimes, respectively. In
particular, we reconsider the interpretation of the Einstein gauge and also the
equations of motion of matter fields and test particles in these theories.
Inspired by the observation that the PGT and WGT matter actions for the Dirac
field and electromagnetic field have more general invariance properties than
those imposed by construction, we go on to present a novel alternative to WGT
by considering an `extended' form for the transformation law of the rotational
gauge field under local dilations, which includes its `normal' transformation
law in WGT as a special case. The resulting `extended' Weyl gauge theory (eWGT)
has a number of interesting features that we describe in detail. In particular,
we present a new scale-invariant gauge theory of gravity that accommodates
ordinary matter and is defined by the most general parity-invariant eWGT
Lagrangian that is at most quadratic in the eWGT field strengths, and we derive
its field equations. We also consider the construction of PGTs that are
invariant under local dilations assuming either the `normal' or `extended'
transformation law for the rotational gauge field, but show that they are
special cases of WGT and eWGT, respectively.

  Building on the work of Gopalan et al. (""The Connectivity of Boolean
Satisfiability: Computational and Structural Dichotomies"", 2006/2009), we first
investigate satisfiability problems given by CSPs, more exactly CNF(S)-formulas

prove a computational dichotomy for the st-connectivity problem, asserting that
it is either solvable in polynomial time or PSPACE-complete, and an aligned
structural dichotomy, asserting that the maximal diameter of connected
components is either linear in the number of variables, or can be exponential;
further, we show a trichotomy for the connectivity problem, asserting that it
is either in P, coNP-complete, or PSPACE-complete.
  Next we investigate two important variants: CNF(S)-formulas without
constants, and partially quantified formulas; in both cases, we prove analogous
dichotomies for st-connectivity and the diameter; for for the connectivity
problem, we show a trichotomy in the case of quantified formulas, while in the
case of formulas without constants, we identify fragments of a possible
trichotomy.
  Finally, we consider the connectivity issues for B-formulas, which are
arbitrarily nested formulas built from some fixed set B of connectives, and for
B-circuits, which are Boolean circuits where the gates are from some finite set
B; we prove a common dichotomy for both connectivity problems and the diameter;
for partially quantified B-formulas, we show an analogous dichotomy.

planets, in the Galaxy. They pose a great challenge for planet formation
theories, which fall into two broad classes: (1) formation further out followed
by inward migration; (2) formation in situ, in the very inner regions of the
protoplanetary disk. We review the pros and cons of these classes, before
focusing on a new theory of sequential in situ formation from the inside-out
via creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous
stream of small (~cm-m size) ""pebbles,"" drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles
first collect at the pressure trap associated with the transition from a
magnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive (""dead zone"") region to an inner,
MRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up that begins to dominate the local mass
surface density of the disk and spawns a planet. The planet continues to grow,
most likely by pebble accretion, until it becomes massive enough to isolate
itself from the accretion flow via gap opening. This reduces the local gas
density near the planet, leading to enhanced ionization and a retreat of the
dead zone inner boundary. The process repeats with a new pebble ring gathering
at the new pressure maximum associated with this boundary. We discuss the
theory's predictions for planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbital
radius, and minimum orbital separations, and their comparison with observed
systems. Finally, we discuss open questions, including potential causes of
diversity of planetary system architectures, i.e., STIPs versus Solar System

decomposition into a set of tasks, most of which are convolutions or FFTs.
Applying Brent's theorem to the task dependency graph implies that linear
speedup with the number of processors is attainable within the PRAM model of
parallel computation, for wide network architectures. To attain such
performance on real shared-memory machines, our algorithm computes convolutions
converging on the same node of the network with temporal locality to reduce
cache misses, and sums the convergent convolution outputs via an almost
wait-free concurrent method to reduce time spent in critical sections. We
implement the algorithm with a publicly available software package called ZNN.
Benchmarking with multi-core CPUs shows that ZNN can attain speedup roughly
equal to the number of physical cores. We also show that ZNN can attain over
90x speedup on a many-core CPU (Xeon Phi Knights Corner). These speedups are
achieved for network architectures with widths that are in common use. The task
parallelism of the ZNN algorithm is suited to CPUs, while the SIMD parallelism
of previous algorithms is compatible with GPUs. Through examples, we show that
ZNN can be either faster or slower than certain GPU implementations depending
on specifics of the network architecture, kernel sizes, and density and size of
the output patch. ZNN may be less costly to develop and maintain, due to the
relative ease of general-purpose CPU programming.

compare it to the recent prediction of Castin et al., Comptes Rendus Physique,
16, 241 (2015). Second, raising the temperature of the mixture slightly above
the superfluid transitions reveals an unexpected phase-locking of the
oscillations of the clouds. We interpret this observation as resulting from a

MEarth has taken approximately two million images of 1844 stars suspected to be
mid-to-late M dwarfs. We have augmented this survey by taking nightly exposures
of photometric standard stars and have utilized this data to photometrically
calibrate the $MEarth$ system, identify photometric nights, and obtain an
optical magnitude with $1.5\%$ precision for each M dwarf system. Each optical
magnitude is an average over many years of data, and therefore should be
largely immune to stellar variability and flaring. We combine this with
trigonometric distance measurements, spectroscopic metallicity measurements,
and 2MASS infrared magnitude measurements in order to derive a
color-magnitude-metallicity relation across the mid-to-late M dwarf spectral
sequence that can reproduce spectroscopic metallicity determinations to a
precision of 0.1 dex. We release optical magnitudes and metallicity estimates
for 1567 M dwarfs, many of which did not have an accurate determination of
either prior to this work. For an additional 277 stars without a trigonometric
parallax, we provide an estimate of the distance assuming solar neighborhood
metallicity. We find that the median metallicity for a volume limited sample of
stars within 20 parsecs of the Sun is [Fe/H] = $-0.03 \pm 0.008$, and that 29 /
565 of these stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-0.5$ or lower, similar to
the low-metallicity distribution of nearby G-dwarfs. When combined with the
results of ongoing and future planet surveys targeting these objects, the

polarization from electrochemically inert, conducting materials in dilute
saline solutions, we theoretically demonstrate a new mechanism for dielectric
enhancement, in the absence of $\zeta-$potentials at interfaces between
non-insulating particles and an electrolyte solution. We further show that the
magnitude of such enhancement obeys universal scaling laws, independent of the
particle's electrical properties and valid across particle shapes: for a dilute
suspension of identical, but arbitrarily shaped particles of a linear dimension
$a$ and volume fraction $f$, as $\omega\to0$ the effective real dielectric
constant of the mixture is enhanced from that of water by a factor
$1+f~(P_r+(a/\lambda)P_i)$, and the frequency-dependent phase shift of its
impedance has a scale-invariant maximum $f\,\mathsf{\Theta}$ if particles are
much more conductive than the solution. Here $\lambda$ is the solution's Debye
length and $P_r$, $P_i$, $\mathsf{\Theta}$ are dimensionless numbers determined
solely by the particles' shape. Even for a very dilute electrolyte solution
(e.g. $10^{-3}$ molar), sub-mm sized particles, at volume fraction $f=0.1$, can
give a $10^4$-fold dielectric enhancement, producing an easily observable phase
shift maximum in a simple impedance measurement.We also derive frequency
cutoffs as conditions for observing these enhancements, showing that insulating
particles produce no enhancement without $\zeta$-potential.To prove these
results for particles of arbitrary shapes, we develop a physical picture where
an externally induced double layer (EIDL), in contrast to the Guoy-Chapman
double layer on interfaces with significant $\zeta$-potentials, dominates the
low-frequency dynamics and produces dielectric enhancement.

transport in III-V semiconductor superlattices (SLs). An effective interface
rms roughness is the only adjustable parameter. Thermal transport inside a
layer is described by the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time
approximation and is affected by the relevant scattering mechanisms
(three-phonon, mass-difference, and dopant and electron scattering of phonons),
as well as by diffuse scattering from the interfaces captured via an effective
interface scattering rate. The in-plane thermal conductivity is obtained from
the layer conductivities connected in parallel. The cross-plane thermal
conductivity is calculated from the layer thermal conductivities in series with
one another and with thermal boundary resistances (TBRs) associated with each
interface; the TBRs dominate cross-plane transport. The TBR of each interface
is calculated from the transmission coefficient obtained by interpolating
between the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM),
where the weight of the AMM transmission coefficient is the same
wavelength-dependent specularity parameter related to the effective interface
rms roughness that is commonly used to describe diffuse interface scattering.
The model is applied to multiple III-arsenide superlattices, and the results
are in very good agreement with experimental findings. The method is both
simple and accurate, easy to implement, and applicable to complicated SL
systems, such as the active regions of quantum cascade lasers. It is also valid
for other SL material systems with high-quality interfaces and predominantly
incoherent phonon transport.

using the Poisson point process approximation to close the recursion-is a
spatially correlated process with weakly repulsive pair interactions. The
reduced Palm target point process is introduced to define the conditional
target point process given the state of one or more known targets. Using the
intensity function of the reduced Palm process, an approximate two-stage pseudo
maximum a posteriori track extractor is developed. The proposed track extractor
is formulated for the PHD filter and implemented in a numerical study that
involves tracking two close-by targets. Numerical results demonstrate
improvement in the mean optimal subpattern assignment statistic for the
proposed track extractor in comparison to the Gaussian mixture PHD filter's
state extractor.

finite gauge transformations by utilizing untwisted form of vector fields. In
our approach, finite gauge transformation law is expressed in terms of
diffeomorphisms on a maximal null subspace on which dynamical degrees of

the composition law. We also show that ours is free from the so-called
Papadopoulos problem, so can describe background with nontrivial three-form
flux $H_3$. Added advantage of our approach is straightforward applicability to
general extended field theories. We demonstrate this by explicitly obtaining
finite transformation law in the SL(5) exceptional field theory.

utilize the normalized excess variance ($\sigma_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$) and probe
variability on rest-frame timescales of several months and years by calculating
$\sigma_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$ from different parts of our light curves. In
addition, we derive the rest-frame optical PSD for our sources using
continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models. We observe that
the excess variance and the PSD amplitude are strongly anti-correlated with
wavelength, bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio. There is no evidence for
a dependency of the variability amplitude on black hole mass and redshift.
These results suggest that the accretion rate is the fundamental physical
quantity determining the rest-frame UV/optical variability amplitude of quasars
on timescales of months and years. The optical PSD of all of our sources is
consistent with a broken power law showing a characteristic bend at rest-frame
timescales ranging between $\sim$100 and $\sim$300 days. The break timescale
exhibits no significant correlation with any of the fundamental AGN parameters.
The low frequency slope of the PSD is consistent with a value of $-1$ for most
of our objects, whereas the high frequency slope is characterized by a broad
distribution of values between $\sim-2$ and $\sim-4$. These findings unveil
significant deviations from the simple ""damped random walk"" model, frequently

question is under which models of (both quantum and classical) side information
multi-source extractors remain secure. In this work we suggest a natural model
of side information, which we call the Markov model, and prove that any
multi-source extractor remains secure in the presence of quantum side
information of this type (albeit with weaker parameters). This improves on
previous results in which more restricted models were considered and the
security of only some types of extractors was shown.

fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and

spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any
specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is
that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members
due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a
novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests
this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra,
rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally
done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and
NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for
each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate
Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of
15 elements: <0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, <~0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg,
Si, and Ni, <~0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and <~0.03 (0.05) dex for Na,

C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred
during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within <~6
Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of
differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic

the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity - a scale-invariant relationship
between black hole mass, X-ray luminosity and radio luminosity that is believed
to hold across at least nine orders of magnitude of mass. There are key
advantages in using only LINERs for the derivation as these are the

mass scaling is sensitive to the slope of the mass - velocity dispersion

peculiar measure of tree balance which is mostly determined by the root balance
of the tree. We present a new test for selection in the same class as Fay and

Shocks must be a fundamental ingredient. Six months of radio observations of
the 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with
Swift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,
non-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ of
freely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical
spectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away
(3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low
frequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high
radio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)
X-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the
conclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other
novae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in
the wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and
optical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in
V5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density
enhancement and a subsequent faster flow. We speculate that the relatively high
speed and low mass of the ejecta led to the unusual radio emission from V5589
Sgr, and perhaps also to the non-detection of $\gamma$-rays.

sensitive to the shape measurement methods used. In this paper we measure the
intrinsic alignments of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III (SDSS-III) Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ galaxies using three different
shape measurement methods (re-Gaussianization, isophotal, and de Vaucouleurs),
identifying a variation in the inferred intrinsic alignments amplitude at the
40% level between these methods, independent of the galaxy luminosity or other
properties. We also carry out a suite of systematics tests on the shapes and
their two-point correlation functions, identifying a pronounced contribution
from additive PSF systematics in the de Vaucouleurs shapes. Since different
methods measure galaxy shapes at different effective radii, the trends we
identify in the intrinsic alignments amplitude are consistent with the
interpretation that the outer regions of galaxy shapes are more responsive to
tidal fields, resulting in isophote twisting and stronger alignments for
isophotal shapes. We observe environment dependence of ellipticity, with
brightest galaxies in groups being rounder on average compared to satellite and
field galaxies. We also study the anisotropy in intrinsic alignments
measurements introduced by projected shapes, finding effects consistent with
predictions of the nonlinear alignment model and hydrodynamic simulations. The
large variations seen using the different shape measurement methods have
important implications for intrinsic alignments forecasting and mitigation with
future surveys.

A proper evaluation of naturalness in SUSY leads to light higgsinos with mass
mu~ 100-300 GeV while other sparticles may inhabit the multi-TeV range at
little cost to naturalness. Special signatures like dilepton mass edges in
gluino pair events and same-sign dibosons from wino pairs might occur at LHC13.
An ILC with \sqrt{s}>2 mu would make the definitive test of naturalness in the
MSSM. Naturalness in the QCD sector requires the axion leading to mixed
axion-WIMP dark matter. There appears a deep connection between electroweak
naturalness and a DFSZ-like SUSY axion sector which gives rise to the mu~

solutions to Euler's equation for two dimensional, inviscid, incompressible,
and irrotational fluids. In addition to their intrinsic mathematical
importance, these solutions are also physically relevant. Rotating superfluid
helium can support rectilinear quantized line vortices, which in certain
regimes are accurately modeled by point vortices. Depending on the number of
vortices, it is possible to have either regular integrable motion or chaotic
motion. Thus, the point vortex model is one of the simplest and most tractable
fluid models which exhibits some of the attributes of weak turbulence.
  The primary aim of this work is to find and classify periodic orbits, a
special class of solutions to the point vortex problem. To achieve this goal,
we introduce a number of algorithms: Lie transforms which ensure that the
equations of motion are accurately solved; constrained optimization which
reduces close return orbits to true periodic orbits; object-oriented
representations of the braid group which allow for the topological comparison
of periodic orbits. By applying these ideas, we accumulate a large data set of
periodic orbits and their associated attributes. To render this set tractable,
we introduce a topological classification scheme based on a natural
decomposition of mapping classes. Finally, we consider some of the intriguing
patterns which emerge in the distribution of periodic orbits in phase space.
Perhaps the most enduring theme which arises from this investigation is the
interplay between topology and geometry. The topological properties of a
periodic orbit will often force it to have certain geometric properties.

the demand for novel human-computer interaction applications, have led to the
development of a number of automatic emotion classification systems. However,
it is still debatable whether the performance of such systems can compare with
human coders. To address this issue, in this study, we present a comprehensive
comparison in a speech-based emotion classification task between 138 Amazon
Mechanical Turk workers (Turkers) and a state-of-the-art automatic computer
system. The comparison includes classifying speech utterances into six emotions
(happy, neutral, sad, anger, disgust and fear), into three arousal classes
(active, passive, and neutral), and into three valence classes (positive,
negative, and neutral). The results show that the computer system outperforms
the naive Turkers in almost all cases. Furthermore, the computer system can
increase the classification accuracy by rejecting to classify utterances for
which it is not confident, while the Turkers do not show a significantly higher
classification accuracy on their confident utterances versus unconfident ones.

excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials that sheds light on the fundamental
differences between excitons in two and three dimensions. In contrast to the
well-known hydrogen model of three-dimensional (3D) excitons, the description
of 2D excitons is complicated by the fact that the screening cannot be assumed
to be local. We show that one can consistently define an effective 2D
dielectric constant by averaging the screening over the extend of the exciton.
For an ideal 2D semiconductor this leads to a simple expression for $E_B$ that
only depends on the excitonic mass and the 2D polarizability $\alpha$. The
model is shown to produce accurate results for 51 transition metal
dichalcogenides. Remarkably, over a wide range of polarizabilities the
expression becomes independent of the mass and we obtain
$E_B^{2D}\approx3/(4\pi\alpha)$, which explains the recently observed linear
scaling of exciton binding energies with band gap. It is also shown that the
model accurately reproduces the non-hydrogenic Rydberg series in WS$_2$ and can
account for screening from the environment.

parameters namely degree and angle of polarization which can probe the emission

the hard X-ray polarimetry is more rewarding because the sources are expected
to be intrinsically highly polarized at higher energies. With the successful
implementation of Hard X-ray optics in NuSTAR, it is now feasible to conceive
Compton polarimeters as focal plane detectors. Such a configuration is likely
to provide sensitive polarization measurements in hard X-rays with a broad
energy band. We are developing a focal plane hard X-ray Compton polarimeter
consisting of a plastic scintillator as active scatterer surrounded by a
cylindrical array of CsI(Tl) scintillators. The scatterer is 5 mm diameter and
100 mm long plastic scintillator (BC404) viewed by normal PMT. The photons
scattered by the plastic scatterer are collected by a cylindrical array of 16
CsI(Tl) scintillators (5 mm x 5 mm x 150 mm) which are read by Si
Photomultiplier (SiPM). Use of the new generation SiPMs ensures the compactness
of the instrument which is essential for the design of focal plane detectors.

problem of finding an optimal weight distribution for one-to-one inter-layer

captures statistical properties of word usage across geographical regions and
uses statistical methods to identify significant changes specific to regions.
While previous approaches have primarily focused on lexical variation between
regions, our method identifies words that demonstrate semantic and syntactic
variation as well.
  We extend recently developed techniques for neural language models to learn
word representations which capture differing semantics across geographical
regions. In order to quantify this variation and ensure robust detection of
true regional differences, we formulate a null model to determine whether
observed changes are statistically significant. Our method is the first such
approach to explicitly account for random variation due to chance while
detecting regional variation in word meaning.

sets: millions of tweets from Twitter spanning not only four different
countries but also fifty states, as well as millions of phrases contained in
the Google Book Ngrams. Our analysis reveals interesting facets of language
change at multiple scales of geographic resolution -- from neighboring states

for the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any
quantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of
this fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local
Hamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to

This was
begun by Cruz-Uribe and Rios who proved that given an operator $L_w=-w^{-1}{\rm
div}(A\nabla)$, where $w\in A_2$ and $A$ is a $w$-degenerate elliptic measure
(i.e, $A=w\,B$ with $B$ an $n\times n$ bounded, complex-valued, uniformly
elliptic matrix), then $L_w$ satisfies the weighted estimate
$\|\sqrt{L_w}f\|_{L^2(w)}\approx\|\nabla f\|_{L^2(w)}$. Here we solve the
$L^2$-Kato problem: under some additional conditions on the weight $w$, the
following unweighted $L^2$-Kato estimates hold $$
\|L_w^{1/2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}\approx\|\nabla f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}. $$
  This extends the celebrated solution to the Kato conjecture by Auscher,
Hofmann, Lacey, McIntosh, and Tchamitchian, allowing the differential operator
to have some degeneracy in its ellipticity. For example, we consider the family
of operators $L_\gamma=-|x|^{\gamma}{\rm div}(|x|^{-\gamma}B(x)\nabla)$, where
$B$ is any bounded, complex-valued, uniformly elliptic matrix. We prove that
there exists $\epsilon>0$, depending only on dimension and the ellipticity
constants, such that $$ \|L_\gamma^{1/2}f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}\approx\|\nabla
f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \qquad -\epsilon<\gamma<\frac{2\,n}{n+2}. $$ This
gives a range of $\gamma$'s for which the classical Kato square root $\gamma=0$
is an interior point.
  Our main results are obtained as a consequence of a rich Calder\'on-Zygmund
theory developed for some operators associated with $L_w$. These results, which
are of independent interest, establish estimates on $L^p(w)$, and also on
$L^p(v\,dw)$ with $v\in A_\infty(w)$, for the associated semigroup, its
gradient, the functional calculus, the Riesz transform, and square functions.
As an application, we solve some unweighted $L^2$-Dirichlet, Regularity and
Neumann boundary value problems for degenerate elliptic operators.

load balancing for Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) dedicated for multimedia applications

on a technique that allows the interleaving of flits from diferente flows in
the same communication channel, and keep the load balancing without a
centralized control in the network. For this purpose, all flits in the network
received extra bits, such that every flit carries routing information. The
routers use this extra information to perform arbitration and schedule the
flits to the corresponding output ports. Analytic comparisons and experimental
data show that the approach adopted in the network keeps average latency lower
for variable bitrate flows than a network based on resource reservation when
both networks are working over 80% of offered load.

due to the computational challenge of solving SDPs, it becomes difficult to use
SDP hierarchies for large-scale problems. To address this, hierarchies of
second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxations resulting from a restriction
of the SOS polynomial condition have been recently proposed to approximate
POPs. Here, we consider alternative ways to use this SOCP restrictions of the

used to strengthen hierarchies of linear programming (LP) relaxations for POPs.
Specifically, we show that this solution approach is substantially more
effective in finding solutions of certain POPs for which the more common
hierarchies of SDP relaxations are known to perform poorly. Furthermore, when
the feasible set of the POP is compact, these SOCP hierarchies converge to the
POP's optimal value.

time-domain training sequence is first proposed to obtain the coarse estimates
of the channel length, path delays and path gains of the wireless channel, by
exploiting the channel's temporal correlation to improve the robustness of the
coarse CE under the severe fading channel with long delay spread. We then
propose the priori-information aided (PA) iterative hard threshold (IHT)
algorithm, which utilizes the priori information of the acquired coarse
estimate for the wireless channel and therefore is capable of obtaining an
accurate channel estimate of the doubly selective fading channel. Compared with
the classical IHT algorithm whose convergence requires the $l_2$ norm of the
measurement matrix being less than 1, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm exploits
the priori information acquired to remove such a limitation as well as to
reduce the number of required iterations. Compared with the existing CS based
CE method for TDS-OFDM, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm significantly reduces the
computational complexity of CE as well as enhances the CE accuracy. Simulation
results demonstrate that, without sacrificing spectral efficiency and changing
the current TDS-OFDM signal structure, the proposed scheme performs better than
the existing CE schemes for TDS-OFDM in various scenarios, especially under

Galactic dynamics and dark matter direct detection experiments. However, the
estimated values from previous works are far from agreeing with each other. In
this work, we provide a well-defined observed sample with 1427 G \& K type
main-sequence stars from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey, taking into account
selection effects, volume completeness, and the stellar populations. We apply a
vertical Jeans equation method containing a single exponential stellar disk, a
razor thin gas disk, and a constant dark matter density distribution to the
sample, and obtain a total surface mass density of $\rm {78.7 ^{+3.9}_{-4.7}\
M_{\odot}\ pc^{-2}}$ up to 1 kpc and a local dark matter density of
$0.0159^{+0.0047}_{-0.0057}\,\rm M_{\odot}\,\rm pc^{-3}$. We find that the
sampling density (i.e. number of stars per unit volume) of the spectroscopic
data contributes to about two-thirds of the uncertainty in the estimated
values. We discuss the effect of the tilt term in the Jeans equation and find
it has little impact on our measurement. Other issues, such as a
non-equilibrium component due to perturbations and contamination by the thick
disk population, are also discussed.

eclipsing millisecond pulsars in close binaries. The formation processes of
these systems are not clear. The three pulsars showing transitions between
rotation- and accretion-powered states belong to both redbacks and transient
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), suggesting a possible evolutionary link
between the them. Through binary evolution calculations, we show that the
accretion disks in almost all LMXBs are subject to the thermal-viscous
instability during certain evolutionary stages, and the parameter space for the
disk instability covers the distribution of known redbacks in the orbital
period - companion mass plane. We accordingly suggest that the abrupt reduction
of the mass accretion rate during quiescence of transient LMXBs provides a
plausible way to switch on the pulsar activity, leading to the formation of
redbacks, if the neutron star has been spun up to be an energetic millisecond
pulsar. We investigate the evolution of redbacks, taking into account the
evaporation feedback, and discuss its possible influence on the formation of
black widow millisecond pulsars.

information and general ambiguity attitudes on factors external to all players.
Our starting point is players' preferences on payoff-distribution vectors,
essentially mappings from states of the world to distributions of payoffs to be
received by players. There are two ways in which equilibria for this preference
game can be defined. When the preferences possess ever more features, we can
gradually add ever more structures to the game. These include real-valued
utility-like functions over payoff-distribution vectors, sets of probabilistic
priors over states of the world, and eventually the traditional
expected-utility framework involving one single prior. We establish equilibrium
existence results, show the upper hemi-continuity of equilibrium sets over
changing ambiguity attitudes, and uncover relations between the two versions of
equilibria. Some attention is paid to the enterprising game, in which players
exhibit ambiguity seeking attitudes while betting optimistically on the
favorable resolution of ambiguities. The two solution concepts are unified at
this game's pure equilibria, whose existence is guaranteed when strategic
complementarities are present. The current framework can be applied to settings
like auctions involving ambiguity on competitors' assessments of item worths.

semi-coherent approach reduces the computational cost by dividing the entire

combined together incoherently. Semi-coherent analyses that attempt to improve
sensitivity by coherently combining data from multiple detectors face a
computational challenge in accounting for uncertainties in signal parameters.
In this article, we lay out a technique to meet this challenge using summed

algorithm called TwoSpect, we confirm that the sensitivity of all-sky,
semi-coherent searches can be improved by coherently combining the short data
segments. For misaligned detectors, however, this improvement requires careful
attention when marginalizing over unknown polarization parameters. In addition,
care must be taken in correcting for differential detector velocity due to the
Earth's rotation for high signal frequencies and widely separated detectors.

enhanced in neutron-capture elements but its abundances cannot be reproduced by
a solar-type s-process pattern alone. Traditionally, it could be classified as

models, we suggest a new physically-motivated origin and classification scheme
for CEMP-s stars and the still poorly-understood CEMP-r/s. The new scheme
describes a continuous transition between these two so-far distinctly treated
subgroups: CEMP-sA, CEMP-sB, and CEMP-sC. Possible causes for a continuous
transition include the number of thermal pulses the AGB companion underwent,
the effect of different AGB star masses on their nucleosynthetic yields, and
physics that is not well approximated in 1-D stellar models such as proton
ingestion episodes and rotation. Based on a set of detailed AGB models, we
suggest the abundance signature of HE 0414-0343 to have arisen from a >1.3 Msun
mass AGB star and a late-time mass transfer, that transformed HE 0414-0343 into
a CEMP-sC star. We also find the [Y/Ba] ratio well parametrizes the
classification and can thus be used to easily classify any future such stars.

from a Fermi surface instability, and it is generic for a wide range of

enough to probe the old red giant population and in turn to estimate the ($l$,
$b$) distribution of faint X-ray point sources such as coronally active

$N(10.5; l, b)$ increases to the Galactic center as $|l|^{-0.30 \pm 0.03}$ in
the range of $-0^{\circ}.1 \geq l \geq -0^{\circ}.7$, but this increase is
significantly slower than the increase ($|l|^{-0.44 \pm 0.02}$ ) of the Fe XXV

$1^{\circ}.5 \leq |l| \leq 2^{\circ}.8$, where faint X-ray point sources are
argued to dominate the diffuse Galactic X-ray ridge emission, the excess of the
Fe XXV K$\alpha$ line intensity over the stellar number density is at least a
factor of two at $|l| = 0^{\circ}.1$. This indicates that a significant part of
the Galactic center diffuse emission arises from a truly diffuse optically-thin

disks through capture of disk gas, by employing an empirical formula for the
gas capture rate and a shallow disk gap model, which are both based on
hydrodynamical simulations. The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of
giant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth
rates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk
accretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with
the rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the
outside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.
Our model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole
for a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of
our solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a
few or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture
because of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient
solid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially
$\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition. By the viscous
evolution with a moderate viscosity of $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}$, most of disk gas
accretes onto the sun and a widely spread low-mass gas disk remains when the
solid core of Jupiter starts gas capture at $t \sim 10^7$ yrs. The depletion of
the disk gas is suitable for explaining the high metallicity in giant planets
of our solar system. A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path
where type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly. In
particular, we also show that the type II migration of Jupiter-size planets
becomes inefficient because of the additional gas depletion due to the rapid
gas capture by themselves.

moduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the
K\""ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of
M-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY
electroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY
breaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,
stau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest
neutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are
around 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV
or larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks. In the dilaton dominant SUSY
breaking scenario, the qualitative picture remain the same but we have heavier
spectra as compared to moduli dominant SUSY breaking scenario. In addition to
it, we have Higgs $H_{2}/A_{1}$-resonance solutions for dark matter (DM). In
both scenarios, the minimal value of DM relic density is about 0.2. To obtain
the observed DM relic density, we can consider the dilution effect from
supercritical string cosmology or introduce the axino as the lightest
supersymmetric particle.

working correlation among repeated measurements. In this paper, we introduce a

univariate score equations using a working discretized multivariate normal
model that is a proper multivariate model. Since the weighted scores method is
a parametric method based on likelihood, we propose composite likelihood
information criteria as an intermediate step for model selection. The same
criteria can be used for both correlation structure and variable selection.
Simulations studies and the application example show that our method
outperforms other existing model selection methods in GEE. From the example, it

derive conditions under which the scalar sound speed squared $c_{\rm s}^2$ is
positive from the radiation era to today. Since $c_{\rm s}^2$ remains to be
smaller than the order of 1, the deviation from Horndeski theories does not
cause heavy oscillations of gauge-invariant gravitational potentials. In this
case, the evolution of matter perturbations at low redshifts is similar to that
in the coupled dark energy scenario with an enhanced gravitational interaction.
On the spherically symmetric background with a matter source, the existence of
field self-interactions suppresses the propagation of fifth force inside a

the cosmological viability of background and perturbations.

hill-top inflation [arXiv:1509.07270] originating from the microcanonical
density matrix initial conditions in cosmology driven by conformal field theory
(CFT). The cosmological instantons of topology $S^1\times S^3$, which set up
these initial conditions, have the shape of a garland with multiple periodic
oscillations of the scale factor of the spatial $S^3$-section. They describe
underbarrier oscillations of the inflaton and scale factor in the vicinity of
the inflaton potential maximum, which gives a sufficient amount of inflation
required by the known CMB data. We build the approximation of two coupled
harmonic oscillators for these garland instantons and show that they can
generate inflation consistent with the parameters of the CMB primordial power
spectrum in the non-minimal Higgs inflation model and in $R^2$ gravity. In
particular, the instanton solutions provide smallness of inflationary slow-roll
parameters $\epsilon$ and $\eta<0$ and their relation $\epsilon\sim\eta^2$
characteristic of these two models. We present the mechanism of formation of
hill-like inflaton potentials, which is based on logarithmic loop corrections
to the asymptotically shift-invariant tree level potentials of these models in
the Einstein frame. We also discuss the role of $R^2$-gravity as an
indispensable finite renormalization tool in the CFT driven cosmology, which
guarantees the non-dynamical (ghost free) nature of its scale factor and
special properties of its cosmological garland type instantons. Finally, as a
solution to the problem of hierarchy between the Planckian scale and the
inflation scale we discuss the concept of a hidden sector of conformal higher
spin fields.

regions being their most prominent representatives on the solar surface. But
even far away from these active regions, magnetic fields are ubiquitous. To a
large extent, their importance for the thermodynamics in the solar photosphere
is determined by the total magnetic flux. Whereas in low-flux quiet Sun
regions, magnetic structures are shuffled around by the motion of granules, the
high-flux areas like sunspots or pores effectively suppress convection, leading
to a temperature decrease of up to 3000 K. The importance of magnetic fields to
the conditions in higher atmospheric layers, the chromosphere and corona, is
indisputable. Magnetic fields in both active and quiet regions are the main
coupling agent between the outer layers of the solar atmosphere, and are
therefore not only involved in the structuring of these layers, but also for
the transport of energy from the solar surface through the corona to the
interplanetary space.
  Consequently, inference of magnetic fields in the photosphere, and especially
in the chromosphere, is crucial to deepen our understanding not only for solar
phenomena such as chromospheric and coronal heating, flares or coronal mass
ejections, but also for fundamental physical topics like dynamo theory or
atomic physics. In this review, we present an overview of significant advances

connected with increasing demands on polarimetric sensitivity and temporal

several tens of atomic and molecular lines that were suitable for determining
chemical abundances. By means of spectral synthesis and line equivalent width

Cr, and Cu, alpha (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), other light elements (C, N, F, Na, Al,

superconductivity research and nanotechnology, is concerned with the study of
properties and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in nanopatterned superconductors,
with particular focus on their confinement, manipulation, and exploitation for
emerging functionalities. Vortex pinning, guided vortex motion, and the ratchet
effect are three main fluxonic ``tools'' which allow for the dynamical (pinned
or moving), the directional (angle-dependent), and the orientational (current
polarity-sensitive) control over the fluxons, respectively. Thanks to the
periodicity of the vortex lattice, several groups of effects emerge when the
vortices move in a periodic pinning landscape: Spatial commensurability of the
location of vortices with the underlying pinning nanolandscape leads to a
reduction of the dc resistance and the microwave loss at the so-called matching
fields. Temporal synchronization of the displacement of vortices with the
number of pinning sites visited during one half ac cycle manifests itself as
Shapiro steps in the current-voltage curves. Delocalization of vortices
oscillating under the action of a high-frequency ac drive can be tuned by a
superimposed dc bias. In this short review a choice of experimental results on
the vortex dynamics in the presence of periodic pinning in Nb thin films is
presented. The consideration is limited to one particular type of artificial
pinning structures --- directly written nanolandscapes of the washboard type,
which are fabricated by focused ion beam milling and focused electron beam
induced deposition. The reported results are relevant for the development of
fluxonic devices and the reduction of microwave losses in superconducting
planar transmission lines.

emission was analyzed by means of Non Local Thermal Equilibiurm codes to derive
the electron temperature and density, and, for the first time, we are able to
accurately probe different physical regimes behind a dissociative shock. We
find a temperature stratification in the range 4000 - 80000 K, and a
significant correlation between temperature and ionization energy. Two density
regimes are identified for the ionized gas, a more tenuous, spatially broad
component (density about 10^3 cm^-3), and a more compact component (density >
10^5 cm^-3) likely associated with the hottest gas. A further neutral component
is also evidenced, having temperature lass than 10000 K and density > 10^4
cm^-3. The gas fractional ionization was estimated solving the ionization
equilibrium equations of atoms detected in different ionization stages. We find
that neutral and fully ionized regions co-exist inside the shock. Also,
indications in favor of at least partially dissociative shock as the main
mechanism for molecular excitation are derived. Chemical abundances are
estimated for the majority of the detected species. On average, abundances of

in particular for evidences of nonlinear behaviors. Methods. We analyse nearly
two years of uninterrupted short cadence data, concentrating in particular on
identified triplets due to stellar rotation that show intriguing behaviors
during the course of the observations. Results. We find clear signatures of
nonlinear effects attributed to resonant mode coupling mechanisms. We find that
a triplet at 4310 {\mu}Hz and this doublet at 3681 {\mu}Hz (most likely the two
visible components of an incomplete triplet) have clear periodic frequency and
amplitude modulations typical of the so-called intermediate regime of the
resonance, with time scales consistent with theoretical expectations. Another
triplet at 5073 {\mu}Hz is likely in a narrow transitory regime in which the
amplitudes are modulated while the frequencies are locked. Using nonadiabatic
pulsation calculations based on a model representative of KIC 08626021 to
evaluate the linear growth rates of the modes in the triplets, we also provide
quantitative information that could be useful for future comparisons with
numerical solutions of the amplitude equations. Conclusions. The identified
modulations are the first clear-cut signatures of nonlinear resonant couplings
occurring in white dwarf stars. These should resonate as a warning to projects
aiming at measuring the evolutionary cooling rate of KIC 08626021, and of white
dwarf stars in general. Nonlinear modulations of the frequencies can
potentially jeopardize any attempt to measure reliably such rates, unless they
could be corrected beforehand. These results should motivate further
theoretical work to develop nonlinear stellar pulsation theory.

properties, planet radius, and the incoming stellar flux are known? A planet is
in the Habitable Zone (HZ) if it harbors liquid water on its surface. The HZ is
traditionally conceived as a sharp region around stars because it is calculated
for one planet with specific properties. Such an approach is limiting because
the planets' atmospheric and geophysical properties, which influence the
presence of liquid water on the surface, are currently unknown but expected to
be diverse.
  A statistical HZ description is outlined which does not favor one planet
type. Instead the stellar and planet properties are treated as random variables
and a continuous range of planet scenarios are considered. Various probability
density functions are assigned to each random variable, and a combination of
Monte Carlo sampling and climate modeling is used to generate synthetic
exoplanet populations with known surface climates. Then, the properties of the
liquid water bearing subpopulation is analyzed.
  Given our current observational knowledge, the HZ takes the form of a
weakly-constrained but smooth probability function. The HZ has an inner edge
but a clear outer edge is not seen. Currently only optimistic upper limits can
be derived for the potentially observable HZ occurrence rate. Finally, we
illustrate through an example how future data on exoplanet atmospheres will
help to narrow down the probability that an exoplanet harbors liquid water and
we identify the greatest observational challenge in the way of finding a

impedance, an attribute that plays no role in ray propagation, and is therefore
irrelevant for pure ray devices; another constraint is that for waves the
spatial variation in material parameters needs to be sufficiently small
compared with the wavelength. The key link between our general formulation and
a specific implementation is how the spatial metric relates to the speed of
disturbance in a given medium, whether it is electromagnetic, acoustic, or
diffusive. Notably, we show that our generalised ray theory, in allowing for
anisotropic indexes (speeds), generates the same predictions as does a wave

discussion in regard to basic examples of one-dimensional non-autonomous
dynamical systems enjoying the property that their Hamiltonian can be mapped
through a time-dependent linear canonical transformation into an autonomous
form, up to a time-dependent multiplicative factor. The operator equations we
process essentially reproduce at the quantum level the classical integrability
condition for these systems. Operator series form solutions in the Bender-Dunne
basis of pseudo-differential operators for one dimensional quantum system are
sought for such equations. The derivation of generating functions for the
coefficients involved in the \emph{minimal} representation of the series
solutions to the operator equations under consideration is particularized. We
also provide explicit form of operators that implement arbitrary linear
transformations on the Bender-Dunne basis by expressing them in terms of the
initial Weyl ordered basis elements. We then remark that the matching of the
minimal solutions obtained independently in the two basis, i.e. the basis prior
and subsequent the action of canonical linear transformation, is perfectly
achieved by retaining only the lowest order contribution in the expression of
the transformed Bender-Dunne basis elements.

special properties of the nonconvex surrogate functions. We also extend IRNN to
solve the nonconvex problem with two or more blocks of variables. In theory, we
prove that IRNN decreases the objective function value monotonically, and any

refractive index of a medium from ultrasound time-of-flight (TOF) measurements.
This problem is very popular in seismics but also for tomographic problems in
inhomogeneous media. For example ultrasound vector field tomography needs a
priori knowledge of the sound speed. According to Fermat's principle ultrasound
signals travel along geodesic curves of a Riemannian metric which is associated
with the refractive index. The inverse problem thus consists of determining the
index of refraction from integrals along geodesics curves associated with the
integrand leading to a nonlinear problem. In this article we describe a
numerical solver for this problem scheme based on an iterative minimization
method for an appropriate Tikhonov functional. The outcome of the method is a
stable approximation of the sought index of refraction as well as a
corresponding set of geodesic curves. We prove some analytical convergence
results for this method and demonstrate its performance by means of several
numerical experiments. Another novelty in this article is the explicit
representation of the backprojection operator for the ray transform in
Riemannian geometry and its numerical realization relying on a corresponding
phase function that is determined by the metric. This gives a natural extension
of the conventional backprojection from 2D computerized tomography to
inhomogeneous geometries.

The expansivity of CO2-hydrate is larger than for CH4-hydrate which leads to
larger lattice constants for the former at temperatures above ~ 150 K; this is
likely due to the higher motional degrees of freedom of the CO2 guest
molecules. (3) The cage filling does not affect significantly the lattice
constants in CH4- and CO2-hydrate in contrast to Xe-hydrate for which the
effect is quantitatively established. (4) Similar to ice Ih, the deuterated
compounds have slightly larger lattice constants for all investigated systems

is smallest for the Xesystem,in which the large Xe atoms lead to an increase of

an ""indicator"" with two key properties: conditional independence of the outcome
(given exposure and measured covariates) absent confounding and other model
miss-specification; and an association with unmeasured confounders (like the
exposure). We now present a new method for correcting for residual confounding
in time-series and other epidemiological studies. We argue that estimators from
models that include an indicator with these key properties should have less
bias than those from models without the indicator.
  Methods: Using causal reasoning and basic regression theory we present
theoretical arguments to support our claims. In simulations, we empirically
evaluate our approach using a time-series study of ozone effects on emergency
department visits for asthma (AV). We base simulations on observed data for
ozone, meteorological factors and asthma.
  Results: In simulations, results from models that included ozone
concentrations one day after the AV yielded effect estimators with slightly or
modestly less residual confounding.
  Conclusion: Theory and simulations show that including the indicator based on
future air pollution levels can reduce residual confounding. Our method differs
from available methods because it uses a regression approach involving an
exposure-based indicator rather than a negative outcome control.

nuclear separation but, similar to the RPA, fails around equilibrium due to the
build up of a large repulsion hump. For the strongly correlated LiH molecule at
dissociation we have also calculated the RPAx potential and find that the
correlation peak at the bond mid-point is overestimated as compared to the RPA

error is comparable to the RPA. This is further illustrated by a smooth energy

achieve competitive performance compared with cluster-based graph processing

system on a single machine. With the abstraction of vertex intervals and edge
sub-shards, we propose the Destination-Sorted Sub-Shard (DSSS) structure to
store a graph. By dividing vertices and edges into intervals and sub-shards,
NXgraph ensures graph data access locality and enables fine-grained scheduling.
By sorting edges within each sub-shard according to their destination vertices,
NXgraph reduces write conflicts among different threads and achieves a high
degree of parallelism. Then, three updating strategies, i.e., Single-Phase
Update (SPU), Double-Phase Update (DPU), and Mixed-Phase Update (MPU), are
proposed in this paper. NXgraph can adaptively choose the fastest strategy for
different graph problems according to the graph size and the available memory
resources to fully utilize the memory space and reduce the amount of data
transfer. All these three strategies exploit streamlined disk access pattern.
Extensive experiments on three real-world graphs and five synthetic graphs show
that NXgraph can outperform GraphChi, TurboGraph, VENUS, and GridGraph in
various situations. Moreover, NXgraph, running on a single commodity PC, can
finish an iteration of PageRank on the Twitter graph with 1.5 billion edges in
2.05 seconds; while PowerGraph, a distributed graph processing system, needs
3.6s to finish the same task.

surface modes of TIs is a plateau that arrests the exponential divergence of

observed in all TI candidates ranging from Bi2Te2Se to SmB6. Recently, several
topological semimetals (TSMs) have been found that exhibit extreme
magnetoresistance (XMR) and TI universal resistivity behavior revealed only
when breaking TRS, a regime where TIs theoretically cease to exist. Among these
new materials, TaAs and NbP are nominated for Weyl semimetal due to their lack

electron-hole symmetry. Yet LaSb portrays all the exotic field induced
behaviors of the aforementioned semimetals in an archetypal fashion. It shows
(a) the universal TI resistivity with a plateau at 15 K, revealed by a magnetic

percent at 9 tesla rivaled only by WTe2 and NbP. Due to its dramatic

up and make possible three large-scale medical image processing use-cases: (i)
parameter optimization for lung texture segmentation using support vector
machines, (ii) content-based medical image indexing, and (iii)
three-dimensional directional wavelet analysis for solid texture
classification. A cluster of heterogeneous computing nodes was set up in our
institution using Hadoop allowing for a maximum of 42 concurrent map tasks. The
majority of the machines used are desktop computers that are also used for
regular office work. The cluster showed to be minimally invasive and stable.
The runtimes of each of the three use-case have been significantly reduced when
compared to a sequential execution. Hadoop provides an easy-to-employ framework
for data analysis tasks that scales well for many tasks but requires
optimization for specific tasks.

Toral and extended to the two-dimensional setting by Mihailovi\'c and

games, the fair, spatially independent game $A$, the spatially dependent game
$B$, and game $C$, which is a random mixture or nonrandom pattern of games $A$
and $B$. Of interest is $\mu_B$ (or $\mu_C$), the mean profit per turn at
equilibrium to the set of $MN$ players playing game $B$ (or game $C$). Game $A$
is fair, so if $\mu_B\le0$ and $\mu_C>0$, then we say the Parrondo effect is
present.
  We obtain a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the
sequence of profits of the set of $MN$ players playing game $B$ (or game $C$).
The mean and variance parameters are computable for small arrays and can be
simulated otherwise. The SLLN justifies the use of simulation to estimate the
mean. The CLT permits evaluation of the standard error of a simulated estimate.
We investigate the presence of the Parrondo effect for both small arrays and
large ones. One of the findings of Mihailovi\'c and Rajkovi\'c was that
""capital evolution depends to a large degree on the lattice size."" We provide
evidence that this conclusion is incorrect. Part of the evidence is that, under
certain conditions, the means $\mu_B$ and $\mu_C$ converge as $M,N\to\infty$.
Proof requires that a related spin system on ${\bf Z}^2$ be ergodic. However,
our sufficient conditions for ergodicity are rather restrictive.

radiative hydrodynamics simulations with Ramses-RT to model the evolution of

and lattice results suggest the necessity of a new implementation of the

also $D>4$ effective condensates are fit to data. Lattice results also provide
a means of quantifying the truncation error for the slowly converging $D=2$ OPE
series. The new implementation is shown to produce $\vert V_{us}\vert$ results
free of unphysical $s_0$- and $w$-dependences and typically $\sim 0.0020$
higher than the (unstable) results found using the conventional implementation.
With preliminary new experimental results for the $K\pi$ branching fraction,
the resulting $\vert V_{us}\vert$ is in excellent agreement with that obtained

density approximation (LDA) and an exact diagonalization (ED) of an effective
discrete Anderson impurity model, the intermediate valence ground state with
the $f$-shell occupation $\langle n_{4f} \rangle=5.6$ is found for the Sm atom
in SmB$_6$. This ground state is a singlet, and the first excited triplet state
$\sim 3$ meV higher in the energy. SmB$_6$ is a narrow band insulator already
in LDA, with the direct band gap of $\sim 10$ meV. The electron correlations
increase the band gap which now becomes indirect. Thus, the many-body effects
are relevant to form the indirect band gap, crucial for the idea of
``topological Kondo insulator"" in SmB$_6$. Also, an actinide analog PuB$_6$ is
considered, and the intermediate valence singlet ground state is found for the
Pu atom. We propose that [Sm,Pu]B$_6$ belong to a new class of the intermediate
valence materials with the multi-orbital ``Kondo-like"" singlet ground-state.
Crucial role of complex spin-orbital $f^n$-$f^{n+1}$ multiplet structure
differently hybridized with ligand states in such Racah materials is discussed.

  Coding in Optical Networks",,,,,"cs.CR cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, physical layer security in the optical layer has gained significant
traction. Security treats in optical networks generally impact the reliability
of optical transmission. Linear Network Coding (LNC) can protect from both the
security treats in form of eavesdropping and faulty transmission due to
jamming. LNC can mix original data to become incomprehensible for an attacker
and also extend original data by coding redundancy, thus protecting a data from
errors injected via jamming attacks. In this paper, we study the effectiveness
of LNC to balance reliable transmission and security in optical networks. To
this end, we combine the coding process with data flow parallelization of the
source and propose and compare optimal and randomized path selection methods
for parallel transmission. The study shows that a combination of data
parallelization, LNC and randomization of path selection increases security and
reliability of the transmission. We analyze the so-called catastrophic security
treat of the network and show that in case of conventional transmission scheme
and in absence of LNC, an attacker could eavesdrop or disrupt a whole secret

with turn-on behavior in the newly discovered XMR material WTe$_2$ can be

observed scaling the magnetic field dependence of the turn-on temperature $T^*

for a predicted metal-insulator transition. The scaling also leads to a simple
quantitative expression for the resistivity $\rho^* \approx 2 \rho_0$ at the
onset of the XMR behavior, which fits the data remarkably well. These results
exclude the possible existence of a magnetic-field-driven metal-insulator
transition or significant contribution of an electronic structure change to the

these light-matter quasiparticles can condense at comparably high temperatures

and time domain even when they are out of equilibrium with the environment.
Although the presence of an in-plane polariton confinement potential is not
strictly necessary in order to observe condensation of polaritons, engineering
the polariton confinement is a key to controlling, shaping and directing the
flow of polaritons. Prototype polariton-based optoelectronic devices rely on
ultrafast photon-like velocities and strong nonlinearities, as well as on
tailored confinement. Nanotechnology provides several pathways to achieving
such a confinement, and the specific features and advantages of the different

techniques. Here we highlight the almost free choice of trapping geometries and
depths of confinement that provides a powerful tool for control and

non-circular throat may lead to a physical wormhole in the sense that the
energy conditions are satisfied. By the same token, herein we consider angular
dependent throat geometry embedded in a $2+1-$dimensional flat spacetime in
polar coordinates. It is shown that a generic, natural example of throat
geometry is provided remarkably by a hypocycloid. That is, two flat
$2+1-$dimensions are glued together along a hypocycloid. The energy required in
each hypocycloid increases with the frequency of the roller circle inside the
large one.

  Supersymmetry","18 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The experimental decay branching ratios of mesons like $B_s\to \ell\bar \ell$
and $B_d\to \ell\bar \ell$ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$) do not agree completely with the
standard model (SM).
  Cartan's supersymmetry predicts relation of the coupling of vector particles
$x_\mu, x_{\mu}'$, ($\mu=1,2,3,4$) to Dirac spinors of large components $\psi,
\phi$ and small components $\mathcal C\psi, \mathcal C\phi$. In the decay of
$B_d=\bar b d$, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) model suggests that the
contribution of $t$ quark dominates, while in the decay of $B_s=\bar b s$,
contribution of $c$ quark in the intermediate state is expected to be large,
since $s$ and $c$ quark belong to the same CKM sector. The relative strength of
the $t$ quark and $c$ quark contribution in Cartan's supersymmetric model has
more freedom than that of the SM. Together with the problem of enhancement of
$B_d\to J/\Psi K_0$ in high $\Delta t$ region, we can understand the problem of
branching ratios of $B$ decay into $e\bar e$ and $\mu\bar\mu$, if the Nature
follows Cartan's supersymmetry.

exponentially or faster, while cultural interaction approaches the fidelity of
a global nervous system. Every day hundreds of millions of images are loaded
into social networks by users all over the world. As this myriad of new
artifacts veils the view into the past, like city lights covering the night
sky, it is easy to forget that there is more than one Starry Night, the
painting by Van Gogh. Like in ecology, where saving rare species may help us in
treating disease, art and architectural history can reveal insights into the
past, which may hold keys to our own future. With humanism under threat, facing
the challenge of understanding the structure and dynamics of art and culture,
both qualitatively and quantitatively, is more crucial now than it ever was.
The purpose of this article is to provide perspective in the aim of figuring
out the process of art history - not art history as a discipline, but the
actual history of all made things, in the spirit of George Kubler and Marcel
Duchamp. In other words, this article deals with the grand challenge of
developing a systematic science of art and culture, no matter what, and no
matter how.

  Springer Series: Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics (in press, 2014).
  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1312.5057",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The process of data interpretation is always based on the implicit
introduction of equivalence relations on the set of walks over the database.
Every equivalence relation on the set of walks specifies a Markov chain
describing the transitions of a discrete time random walk. In order to
geometrize and interpret the data, we propose the new distance between data
units defined as a ""Feynman path integral"", in which all possible paths between
any two nodes in a graph model of the data are taken into account, although
some paths are more preferable than others. Such a path integral distance
approach to the analysis of databases has proven its efficiency and success,
especially on multivariate strongly correlated data where other methods fail to
detect structural components (urban planning, historical language phylogenies,
music, street fashion traits analysis, etc. ). We believe that it would become
an invaluable tool for the intelligent complexity reduction and big data
interpretation.
