transformation are a powerful tool in the study of CP. They are particularly
convenient to study the CP properties of models with family symmetries. After
interpreting the consequences of adding specific CP symmetries to a Lagrangian
invariant under $\Delta(27)$, I use the invariant approach to systematically
study Yukawa-like Lagrangians with an increasing field content in terms of
$\Delta(27)$ representations. Included in the Lagrangians studied are models
featuring explicit CP violation with calculable phases (referred to as explicit
geometrical CP violation) and models that automatically conserve CP, despite
having all the $\Delta(27)$ representations.

vigorously star-forming radio galaxies in the Universe. What triggered its
activity? We present ALMA Cycle 2 observations of cold molecular CO(6-5) gas
and dust, which reveal that this is likely a gas-rich triple merger. It
consists of a close double nucleus (separation ~4 kpc) and a weak CO-emitter at
~10 kpc distance, all of which have counterparts in HST/NICMOS imagery. The
hyper-luminous starburst and powerful radio-AGN were triggered at this
precoalescent stage of the merger. The CO(6-5) traces dense molecular gas in
the central region, and complements existing CO(1-0) data, which revealed more
widespread tidal debris of cold gas. We also find ~10$^{10}$ M(sun) of
molecular gas with enhanced excitation at the highest velocities. At least
20-50% of this high-excitation, high-velocity gas shows kinematics that
suggests it is being displaced and redistributed within the merger, although
with line-of-sight velocities of |v| < 500 km/s, this gas will probably not
escape the system. The processes that drive the redistribution of cold gas are
likely related to either the gravitational interaction between two kpc-scale
discs, or starburst/AGN-driven outflows. We estimate that the rate at which the
molecular gas is redistributed is at least ~1200 +- 500 M(sun)/yr, and could
perhaps even approach the star formation rate of ~3000 +- 800 M(sun)/yr. The
fact that the gas depletion and gas redistribution timescales are similar
implies that dynamical processes can be important in the evolution of massive
high-z galaxies.

groups, and study the combinatorics, the duality theory, and the metric
properties of codes endowed with such functions. The weights are obtained by
composing a suitable support map with the rank function of a graded lattice
satisfying certain regularity properties. A regular weight on a group
canonically induces a regular weight on the character group, and invertible
MacWilliams identities always hold for such a pair of weights. Moreover, the
Krawtchouk coefficients of the corresponding MacWilliams transformation have a
precise combinatorial significance, and can be expressed in terms of the
invariants of the underlying lattice. In particular, they are easy to compute
in many examples. Several weight functions traditionally studied in Coding
Theory belong to the class of weights introduced in this paper. Our
lattice-theory approach also offers a control on metric structures that a
regular weight induces on the underlying group. In particular, it allows to
show that every finite abelian group admits weight functions that,
simultaneously, give rise to MacWilliams identities, and endow the underlying
group with a metric space structure. We propose a general notion of extremality
for (not necessarily additive) codes in groups endowed with semi-regular
supports, and establish a Singleton-type bound. We then investigate the
combinatorics and duality theory of extremal codes, extending classical results
on the weight and distance distribution of error-correcting codes. Finally, we
apply the theory of MacWilliams identities to enumerative combinatorics
problems, obtaining closed formulae for the number of rectangular matrices over
a finite having prescribed rank and satisfying some linear conditions.

groups. It was introduced a few years ago by Lewis Bowen, and shown to extend

Some parts of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy theory generalize to sofic entropy, but
in other respects this new invariant behaves less regularly.
  This paper explores conditions under which sofic entropy is additive for
Cartesian products of systems. It is always subadditive, but the reverse
inequality can fail. We define a new entropy-notion in terms of probability
distributions on the spaces of good models of an action. Using this, we prove a
general lower bound for the sofic entropy of a Cartesian product in terms of
separate quantities for the two factor systems involved. We also prove that
this lower bound is optimal in a certain sense, and use it to derive some
sufficient conditions for the strict additivity of sofic entropy itself.
Various other properties of this new entropy notion are also developed.

The expectation value of the phonon displacement $<u_q>$ oscillates at the mode
frequency for the coherent state but remains zero for a pure squeezed state. In
contrast, both show oscillations in $<|u_q|^2>$ at twice the mode frequency.
Therefore it can be difficult to distinguish them in a second-order measurement
of the displacements, such as in first-order x-ray diffuse scattering. Here we
demonstrate a simple method to distinguish squeezed from coherent atomic motion

parameters of galaxies from images in different spectral bands. We present a
hierarchical Bayesian model for obtaining age maps from images in the \Ha\ line
(taken with Taurus Tunable Filter (TTF)), ultraviolet band (far UV or FUV, from
GALEX) and infrared bands (24, 70 and 160 microns ($\mu$m), from Spitzer). As
shown in S\'anchez-Gil et al. (2011), we present the burst ages for young
stellar populations in the nearby and nearly face on galaxy M74.
  As it is shown in the previous work, the \Ha\ to FUV flux ratio gives a good
relative indicator of very recent star formation history (SFH). As a nascent
star-forming region evolves, the \Ha\ line emission declines earlier than the
UV continuum, leading to a decrease in the \Ha\/FUV ratio. Through a specific
star-forming galaxy model (Starburst 99, SB99), we can obtain the corresponding
theoretical ratio \Ha\ / FUV to compare with our observed flux ratios, and thus
to estimate the ages of the observed regions.
  Due to the nature of the problem, it is necessary to propose a model of high
complexity to take into account the mean uncertainties, and the
interrelationship between parameters when the \Ha\ / FUV flux ratio mentioned
above is obtained. To address the complexity of the model, we propose a
Bayesian hierarchical model, where a joint probability distribution is defined
to determine the parameters (age, metallicity, IMF), from the observed data, in
this case the observed flux ratios \Ha\ / FUV. The joint distribution of the
parameters is described through an i.i.d. (independent and identically
distributed random variables), generated through MCMC (Markov Chain Monte

  Density is shown to satisfy Silver's theorem. The most important case is:

observed: The forward transmission coefficient $S_{21}(f)$ of the microstrips
can be controllably modulated within a range of about $3$\,dB by the ac
current. For the sample with symmetric grooves, depending on the choice of the
operation point in the current-voltage curve, the shape and the duty cycle of
the output signal can be tuned. For the sample with asymmetric grooves,
depending on the ac amplitude, a sine-to-triangular or a sine-to-rectangular

significance in optimization, game theory and other fields. In this paper, we
develop a numerical technique for computing multiple isolated solutions of
complementarity problems, starting from the same initial guess. This technique,
called deflation, is applied in conjunction with existing algorithms that
reformulate the complementarity problem as the rootfinding problem of a
semismooth residual. After one solution is found, the idea of deflation is to
apply operators to the arguments of the corresponding semismooth reformulation
to ensure that solvers will not converge to that same solution again. This
ensures that if the semismooth solver is restarted from the same initial guess
and it converges, it will converge to a different solution. We prove
theoretical results on the effectiveness of the method, and apply it to several
difficult finite-dimensional complementarity problems from the literature.
While deflation is not guaranteed to find all solutions, for every problem
considered with a finite number of solutions, we identify initial guesses from
which all known solutions are computed with deflation.

ensembles and complex probabilistic graphical models, can be expensive to
store, slow to evaluate and hard to integrate into larger systems. Ideally, we
would like to replace such cumbersome models with simpler models that perform
equally well.
  In this thesis, we study knowledge distillation, the idea of extracting the
knowledge contained in a complex model and injecting it into a more convenient
model. We present a general framework for knowledge distillation, whereby a
convenient model of our choosing learns how to mimic a complex model, by
observing the latter's behaviour and being penalized whenever it fails to
reproduce it.
  We develop our framework within the context of three distinct machine
learning applications: (a) model compression, where we compress large
discriminative models, such as ensembles of neural networks, into models of
much smaller size; (b) compact predictive distributions for Bayesian inference,
where we distil large bags of MCMC samples into compact predictive
distributions in closed form; (c) intractable generative models, where we
distil unnormalizable models such as RBMs into tractable models such as NADEs.
  We contribute to the state of the art with novel techniques and ideas. In
model compression, we describe and implement derivative matching, which allows
for better distillation when data is scarce. In compact predictive
distributions, we introduce online distillation, which allows for significant
savings in memory. Finally, in intractable generative models, we show how to
use distilled models to robustly estimate intractable quantities of the
original model, such as its intractable partition function.

on single-crystal samples etched to well-defined geometries using focussed
ion-beam techniques, yield a room-temperature resistivity of only
2.1~$\mu\Omega$cm, establishing PtCoO$_2$ as the most conductive oxide known.
From angle-resolved photoemission and density-functional theory, we show that
the underlying Fermi surface is a single cylinder of nearly hexagonal
cross-section, with very weak dispersion along k$_z$. Despite being
predominantly composed of $d$-orbital character, the conduction band is
remarkably steep, with an average effective mass of only 1.14$m_e$. Moreover,
the sharp spectral features observed in photoemission remain well-defined with
little additional broadening for over 500~meV below E$_F$, pointing to
suppressed electron-electron scattering. Together, our findings establish
PtCoO$_2$ as a model nearly-free electron system in a $5d$ delafossite

distinguish ionisation mechanisms on a pixel-by-pixel basis and show that
despite the previously reported hypersonic gas and super-bubble blow out, the
gas in Mrk 71 is photoionised, with no sign of shock-excited emission. Using
strong-line metallicity diagnostics, we present the first 'metallicity image'

smaller than a HII region. HeII emission line images are used to identify up to
six Wolf-Rayet stars in Mrk 71, three of which lie on the edge of blow-out

for large-scale systems. We therefore propose the stochastic beamformed AF
(SBF-AF) schemes, which differ from the BF-AF scheme in that time-varying AF
weights are used. We prove that the MMF rates of the proposed SBF-AF schemes
are at most $0.8317$ bits/s/Hz less than the SDR rate, irrespective of the
number of users or power constraints. Thus, SBF-AF can outperform BF-AF
especially in large-scale systems. Finally, we present numerical results to
demonstrate the viability of our proposed schemes.

sample from complex probability measures. Many available techniques rely on
discrete-time reversible Markov chains whose transition kernels build up over
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We explore and propose several original
extensions of an alternative approach introduced recently in Peters and de With
(2012) where the target distribution of interest is explored using a
continuous-time Markov process. In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a trial
move to a region of lower target density, equivalently ""higher energy"", than
the current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this
alternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines continuously around
the space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is not rejected but its
path is modified by bouncing against this barrier. The resulting non-reversible
Markov process provides a rejection-free MCMC sampling scheme. We propose
several original techniques to simulate this continuous-time process exactly in
a wide range of scenarios of interest to statisticians. When the target
distribution factorizes as a product of factors involving only subsets of
variables, such as the posterior distribution associated to a probabilistic
graphical model, it is possible to modify the original algorithm to exploit
this structure and update in parallel variables within each clique. We present
several extensions by proposing methods to sample mixed discrete-continuous
distributions and distributions restricted to a connected smooth domain. We
also show that it is possible to move the particle using a general flow instead
of straight lines. We demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology through
simulations on a variety of applications and show that it can outperform Hybrid
Monte Carlo schemes in interesting scenarios.

pairs and a gluon, allowing e.g. for arbitrary neutralino compositions and
keeping the leading quark mass dependence at all stages in the calculation. We
find in some cases largely enhanced annihilation rates, especially for
scenarios with squarks being close to degenerate in mass with the lightest
neutralino, but also notable distortions in the associated antiproton and
gamma-ray spectra. Both effects significantly impact limits from indirect
searches for dark matter and are thus important to be taken into account in,
e.g., global scans. For extensive scans, on the other hand, full calculations
of QCD corrections are numerically typically too expensive to perform for each
point in parameter space. We present here for the first time an efficient,
numerically fast implementation of QCD corrections, extendable in a
straight-forward way to non-supersymmetric models, which avoids computationally
demanding full one-loop calculations or event generator runs and yet fully
captures the leading effects relevant for indirect dark matter searches. In
this context, we also present updated constraints on dark matter annihilation
from cosmic-ray antiproton data. Finally, we comment on the impact of our
results on relic density calculations.

conditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor
~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale
variations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form
highly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission

filaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same
location. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust
growth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size
range. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100
cm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the
density varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales
(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in
the subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes

exoplanetary system with sufficiently short orbital periods, the motion of the
planets allows us to discriminate them from the PSF. In addition to using
powerful PSF subtraction algorithms, such an observing strategy enables
temporal filtering. Once an orbit is determined, the planet can be
``de-orbited'' to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We call this
collection of techniques Orbital Differential Imaging (ODI). Here we present
the motivation for this technique, present a noise model, and present results
from simulations. We believe ODI will be an enabling technique for imaging

nearby stars. It is commonly thought that directly imaging a potentially
habitable exoplanet around a Sun-like star requires space telescopes with
apertures of at least 1m. A notable exception to this is Alpha Centauri (A and
B), which is an extreme outlier among FGKM stars in terms of apparent habitable
zone size: the habitable zones are ~3x wider in apparent size than around any
other FGKM star. This enables a ~30-45cm visible light space telescope equipped
with a modern high performance coronagraph or starshade to resolve the
habitable zone at high contrast and directly image any potentially habitable
planet that may exist in the system. We presents a brief analysis of the
astrophysical and technical challenges involved with direct imaging of Alpha
Centauri with a small telescope and describe two new technologies that address
some of the key technical challenges. In particular, the raw contrast
requirements for such an instrument can be relaxed to 1e-8 if the mission
spends 2 years collecting tens of thousands of images on the same target,
enabling a factor of 500-1000 speckle suppression in post processing using a
new technique called Orbital Difference Imaging (ODI). The raw light leak from
both stars is controllable with a special wavefront control algorithm known as
Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC), which independently suppresses diffraction
and aberrations from both stars using independent modes on the deformable
mirror. We also show an example of a small coronagraphic mission concept to
take advantage of this opportunity.

(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer
Neptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in
the planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the
increasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship
and heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are
independent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass
locked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence
rates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same
mass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where
Kepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average
heavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with
stellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7
M_Earth in M stars. This trend stands in stark contrast with observed
protoplanetary disk masses that decrease towards lower mass stars, and provides
a challenge for current planet formation models. Neither models of in situ
formation nor migration of fully-formed planets are consistent with these
results. Instead, these results are indicative of large-scale inward migration
of planetary building blocks --- either through type-I migration or radial
drift of dust grains --- that is more efficient for lower mass stars, but does
not result in significantly larger or smaller planets.

well beyond the formal tidal radius with an estimated contamination by
non-members of only 1%. We derive photometric [Fe/H] of red giants, and
depending on which literature metallicity relation we use, find reasonable to
excellent agreement with spectroscopic [Fe/H]. We demonstrate explicitly that
the photometric errors are not Gaussian, and using a realistic model for the
photometric uncertainties, find a formal internal [Fe/H] spread of
$\sigma=0.11^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ dex. This is an upper limit to the cluster's true
[Fe/H] spread and may partially/entirely reflect the limited precision of the
photometric metallicity estimation and systematic effects. The lack of
correlation between spectroscopic and photometric [Fe/H] of individual stars is
further evidence against a [Fe/H] spread on the 0.1 dex level. Finally, the
CN-sensitive $\delta_4$ anti-correlates strongly with Mg abundance, indicating
that the 2nd generation stars are N-enriched. Absence of similar correlations
in some other CN-sensitive indices supports the second generation being
He-rich, which in these indices approximately compensates the shift due to CN.
Compared to a single continuous distribution with finite dispersion, the
observed $\delta_4$ distribution is slightly better fit by two discrete
populations, with the N-enhanced stars accounting for 53$\pm$5%. NGC 2419
appears to be very similar to other metal-poor Galactic globular clusters with
a similarly N-enhanced second generation and little or no variation in [Fe/H],
which sets it apart from other suspected accreted nuclei such as {\omega}Cen.

deployment and commissioning of the first generation of specialized
ground-based instruments such as the Gemini Planet Imager and SPHERE. These
systems will allow detection of Jupiter-like planets $10^7$ times fainter than
their host star. Obtaining this contrast level and beyond requires the
combination of a coronagraph to suppress light coming from the host star and a
wavefront control system including a deformable mirror (DM) to remove residual
starlight (speckles) created by the imperfections of telescope. However, all
these current and future systems focus on detecting faint planets around single
host stars, while several targets or planet candidates are located around
nearby binary stars such as our neighboring star Alpha Centauri. Here, we
present a method to simultaneously correct aberrations and diffraction of light
coming from the target star as well as its companion star in order to reveal
planets orbiting the target star. This method works even if the companion star
is outside the control region of the DM (beyond its half-Nyquist frequency), by
taking advantage of aliasing effects.

momenta $(Q, 0)$ and $(0,Q)$ ($\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_y$ respectively), detected
in the underdoped cuprates. The CDW order in real space can be uni-directional
(either $\Delta_x$ or $\Delta_y$ is non-zero) or bi-directional (both
$\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_y$ are non-zero). To understand which of the two orders
develop, we adopt the magnetic scenario, in which the CDW order appears due to
spin-fluctuation exchange, and derive the Ginzburg-Landau action to the sixth
order in $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_y$. We argue that, at the mean-field level, the
CDW order is bi-directional at the onset, with equal amplitudes of $\Delta_x$
and $\Delta_y$, but changes to uni-directional inside the CDW phase. This
implies that, at a given temperature, CDW order is uni-directional at smaller
dopings, but becomes bi-directional at larger dopings. This is consistent with
recent x-ray data on YBCO, which detected tendency towards bi-directional order
at larger dopings. We discuss the role of discrete symmetry breaking at a
higher temperature for the interplay between bi-directional and uni-directional
CDW orders and also discuss the role of pair-density-wave (PDW) order, which
may appear along with CDW. We argue that PDW with the same momentum as CDW
changes the structure of the bi-directional charge order by completely
replacing either $\Delta_x$ or $\Delta_y$ CDW components by PDW. However, if an
""Amperean"" PDW order, which pairs fermions with approximately the same momenta,
is also present, both $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_y$ remain non-zero in the
bi-directional phase, albeit with non-equal amplitudes. This is again
consistent with x-ray experiments, which at larger doping found non-equal
$\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_y$ in every domain.

Keck/DEIMOS high resolution spectra at each spatial resolution element to
measure the amount of attenuation faced by ionized gas at different radii from
the center of galaxies. We find a good agreement between the integrated and
median of resolved color excess measurements in our galaxies. The ratio of
integrated nebular to stellar dust extinction is always greater than unity, but
does not show any trend with stellar mass or star formation rate. We find that
inclination plays an important role in the variation of the nebular to stellar
excess ratio. The stellar color excess profiles are found to have higher values
at the center compared to outer parts of the disk. However, for lower mass
galaxies, a similar trend is not found for the nebular color excess. We find
that the nebular color excess increases with stellar mass surface density. This
explains the absence of radial trend in the nebular color excess in lower mass
galaxies which lack a large radial variation of stellar mass surface density.
Using standard conversions of star formation rate surface density to gas mass
surface density, and the relation between dust mass surface density and color
excess, we find no significant variation in the dust to gas ratio in regions

are sensitive to indirect effects and often partial correlations are used
instead. Yet, partial correlations convey no information about the (linear)
influence of the coexpressed genes on the entire multivariate system, which may
be crucial to discriminate functional associations from genetic interactions.

it represents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of young planetary
systems. We aim at further investigating the close (tens of au scales)
environment of the HD~106906AB system. We used the extreme AO fed, high
contrast imager SPHERE recently installed on the VLT to observe HD~106906. Both
the IRDIS imager and the Integral Field Spectrometer were used. We discovered a
very inclined, ring-like disk at a distance of 65~au from the star. The disk
shows a strong brightness asymmetry with respect to its semi-major axis. It
shows a smooth outer edge, compatible with ejection of small grains by the
stellar radiation pressure. We show furthermore that the planet's projected
position is significantly above the disk's PA. Given the determined disk
inclination, it is not excluded though that the planet could still orbit within
the disk plane if at a large separation (2000--3000 au). We identified several
additional point sources in the SPHERE/IRDIS field-of-view, that appear to be
background objects. We compare this system with other debris disks sharing
similarities, and we briefly discuss the present results in the framework of
dynamical evolution.

The intelligent selection for mutation vectors is performed by applying design
space (also known as decision space) criterion or fitness space criterion,
however, in both cases, half of valuable information of the problem space is
disregarded. In this article, a Universal Differential Evolution (UDE) is
proposed which takes advantage of both design and fitness spaces criteria for

unchanged by the addition of clusters data. The calibration of the mass

successfully estimated in 28 out of 37 observed objects from the combination of
the H_beta emission linewidth and continuum luminosity at rest-frame 5100A.
Comparing these results with those from previous studies of quasars with
similar redshift, our sample exhibited slightly lower (~ -0.11 dex in median)
Eddington ratios; and, the SMBH masses are slightly (~ 0.38 dex in median)
higher. The SMBH growth time, t_grow, was calculated by dividing the estimated
SMBH mass by the mass accretion rate measured using optical luminosity. We
found, given reasonable assumptions, that t_grow was smaller than the age of
the universe at the redshift of individual quasars for a large fraction of
observed sources, suggesting that the SMBHs in many of our observed quasars are
in growing phase with high accretion rates. A comparison of the SMBH masses
derived from our H_beta data and archived CIV data indicated considerable
scattering, as indicated in previous studies. All quasars with measured SMBH
masses have at least one nearby bright star, such that they are suitable
targets for adaptive optics observations to study the mass relationship between

primordial power spectrum with a specific dependence on wavenumber k. We
explore some of the consequences for precision measurements of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). Quantum relaxation is a feature of the de
Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, which allows the
existence of more general physical states that violate the Born probability
rule. Recent work has shown that relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for
long-wavelength field modes on expanding space, resulting in a large-scale
power deficit with a characteristic inverse-tangent dependence on k. Because
the quantum relaxation dynamics is independent of the direction of the wave
vector for the relaxing field mode, in the limit of weak anisotropy we are able
to derive an expression for the anisotropic power spectrum that is determined
by the power deficit function. As a result, the off-diagonal terms in the CMB
covariance matrix are also determined by the power deficit. We show that the
lowest-order l-(l+1) inter-multipole correlations have a characteristic scaling
with multipole moment l. Our derived spectrum also predicts a residual
statistical anisotropy at small scales, with an approximate consistency
relation between the scaling of the l-(l+1) correlations and the scaling of the
angular power spectrum at high l. We also predict a relationship between the
l-(l+1) correlations at large and small scales. Cosmological quantum relaxation
appears to provide a single physical mechanism that predicts both a large-scale
power deficit and a range of statistical anisotropies, together with
potentially testable relationships between them.

  arXiv:1404.3326",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There have been numerous reports of quasiperiodicities in solar activity in
the intermediate period range. However, no accepted explanation for the
episodic occurrence of quasiperiodicities has emerged. This paper examines the
possibility that the periodicities are associated with a Mercury Sun
interaction of base period 88 days. To test this idea we band pass filter the
140 year long daily sunspot area data to obtain the 88 day period and 176 day
sub harmonic period components of the data and compare the time variation of
the components with the time variation of the orbital radius of Mercury, or
more specifically with the time variation of the tidal effect of Mercury. We
were able to show that, when successive episodes of the occurrence of the 88
day period component were discrete and not overlapping in time, the time
variation of this component of sunspot area was either exactly in-phase or
exactly in anti-phase with the time variation of tidal effect. A similar result
was obtained for the 176 day period component. When several discrete episodes
of the components occurred during a solar cycle the spectrum of the sunspot
area data exhibited strong sidebands with periods dependent on the duration of
the episodes. A simple model based on episode modulation and solar cycle
modulation of 88 day and sub harmonic period sinusoids reproduced most of the
spectral peaks observed in the intermediate range of sunspot area periodicity.
This is compelling evidence of a link between the motion of Mercury and the
periodic emergence of sunspots. It is proposed that the link involves magnetic
surface waves with mode periods close to the sub harmonic periods associated
with Mercury and the triggering of sunspot emergence by the waves.

National University.
  In this work we introduce several new optimisation methods for problems in
machine learning. Our algorithms broadly fall into two categories: optimisation
of finite sums and of graph structured objectives. The finite sum problem is
simply the minimisation of objective functions that are naturally expressed as
a summation over a large number of terms, where each term has a similar or
identical weight. Such objectives most often appear in machine learning in the
empirical risk minimisation framework in the non-online learning setting. The
second category, that of graph structured objectives, consists of objectives
that result from applying maximum likelihood to Markov random field models.
Unlike the finite sum case, all the non-linearity is contained within a
partition function term, which does not readily decompose into a summation.
  For the finite sum problem, we introduce the Finito and SAGA algorithms, as
well as variants of each.
  For graph-structured problems, we take three complementary approaches. We
look at learning the parameters for a fixed structure, learning the structure
independently, and learning both simultaneously. Specifically, for the combined
approach, we introduce a new method for encouraging graph structures with the
""scale-free"" property. For the structure learning problem, we establish
SHORTCUT, a O(n^{2.5}) expected time approximate structure learning method for
Gaussian graphical models. For problems where the structure is known but the
parameters unknown, we introduce an approximate maximum likelihood learning
algorithm that is capable of learning a useful subclass of Gaussian graphical
models.

examines modelling methodologies and systematic effects. In particular we focus
on the consequences of fitting quasar absorption systems with too few absorbing

absorption complex. We show that using insufficient continuum regions around an
absorption complex causes a significant increase in the scatter of a sample of
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ measurements, thus unnecessarily reducing the overall
precision. We further show that fitting absorption systems with too few

rate performance in a large-scale uplink massive MIMO network. Based on the
model, expressions are derived for spatial average SINR distributions over user
and base station distributions with maximum ratio combining (MRC) and
zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. We show that using massive MIMO, the uplink SINR
in certain urban marco-cell scenarios is limited by interference. In the
interference-limited regime, the results reveal that for MRC receivers, a
super-linear (polynomial) scaling law between the number of base station
antennas and scheduled users per cell preserves the uplink SIR distribution,
while a linear scaling applies to ZF receivers. ZF receivers are shown to
outperform MRC receivers in the SIR coverage, and the performance gap is
quantified in terms of the difference in the number of antennas to achieve the
same SIR distribution. Numerical results verify the analysis. It is found that
the optimal compensation fraction in fractional power control to optimize rate
is generally different for MRC and ZF receivers. Besides, simulations show that
the scaling results derived from the proposed framework apply to the networks
where base stations are distributed according to a hexagonal lattice.

function and overall cardiovascular health. While multi-lead ECG recordings are
often necessary for a proper assessment of cardiac rhythms, they are not always
available or practical, for example in fetal ECG applications. Moreover, a wide
range of small non-obtrusive single-lead ECG ambulatory monitoring devices are
now available, from which heart rate variability (HRV) and other health-related
metrics are derived. Proper beat detection and classification of abnormal
rhythms is important for reliable HRV assessment and can be challenging in
single-lead ECG monitoring devices. In this manuscript, we modeled the heart
rate signal as an adaptive non-harmonic model and used the newly developed
synchrosqueezing transform (SST) to characterize ECG patterns. We show how the
proposed model can be used to enhance heart beat detection and classification
between normal and abnormal rhythms. In particular, using the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database and
the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) beat

a portion of the annotated beat database using the SST-derived instantaneous

a single ECG lead. We obtained sensitivities and positive predictive values
comparable to other published algorithms using multiple leads and many more

mode of nearly the same frequency. The results may be of general interest, but
in particular have application to the ""beating-modes model"" of the Blazhko
effect which was recently shown to accurately reproduce the light curve of RR
Lyr. For weak coupling, the two modes do not phase-lock and they retain
separate frequencies, but the coupling nevertheless has important consequences.
Upon increasing the coupling strength from zero, an additional side-peak
emerges in the spectrum forming an asymmetric triplet centered on the
fundamental. As the coupling is further increased, the amplitude of this
side-peak increases and the three peaks are also pulled towards each other,
decreasing the Blazhko frequency. Beyond a critical coupling strength,
phase-locking occurs between the modes. With appropriate choice of coupling
strength, this ""interactive beating-modes model"" can match the side-peak
amplitude ratio of any star. The effects of nonlinear damping are also explored
and found to generate additional side-peaks of odd order. Consistent with this,
the odd side-peaks are found to be favored in V808 Cyg. It is also shown that
the Blazhko effect generates a fluctuating ""environment"" that can have a
modulatory effect on other excited modes of the star. An example is found in
V808 Cyg where the modulation is at double the Blazhko frequency. An
explanation is found for this mysterious doubling, providing additional
evidence in favor of the model.

is further supported by the frequency dependence of the vibrational density of

negligible when the length scale is larger than the vibrational amplitude. This
suggests that the finite-size effect in a 2D system is transient and also that
the structural relaxation itself is not fundamentally different from that in a
3D system. In fact, the dynamic correlation lengths estimated from the

were represented by a highly absorbed power-law model with a photon index of
1.7+/-0.3 and a moderately absorbed thermal emission with a temperature of
0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08} keV. The difference in the N_{H} values between the two
components suggests that the thermal component is unrelated with the power-law
component and is a foreground emission located in the same line-of-sight.
G23.5+0.1 is an extended source with a size of 3'.5. The spectra were fitted
with an absorbed power-law model with a photon index of 2.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}. The
spatial and spectral properties show that both are candidates of old pulsar
wind nebulae (PWNe). In addition to the extended sources, we analyzed spectra
of three point sources found in the observed fields. Based on the spectral

previous work. In particular, the presented results allow nonorthogonal

the performance of their developed approaches, which are deemed to be of

been developed for a practical radar application which must involve
nonorthogonal signals, for which the best performance is unknown, is a great

the approximate location of the target being known from previous target

investigations of the mean squared error of the maximum likelihood estimation
are employed to support the validity of the CRBs. In order to demonstrate the

recent climate change. Most instrumentally recorded climate data are only
available for the past 200 years, so proxy observations from natural archives
are often considered. We describe a model-based approach to reconstructing
climate defined in terms of raw tree-ring measurement data that simultaneously
accounts for non-climatic and climatic variability. In this approach we specify
a joint model for the tree-ring data and climate variable that we fit using
Bayesian inference. We consider a range of prior densities and compare the
modeling approach to current methodology using an example case of Scots pine
from Tornetrask, Sweden to reconstruct growing season temperature. We describe
how current approaches translate into particular model assumptions. We explore
how changes to various components in the model-based approach affect the
resulting reconstruction. We show that minor changes in model specification can
have little effect on model fit but lead to large changes in the predictions.
In particular, the periods of relatively warmer and cooler temperatures are
robust between models, but the magnitude of the resulting temperatures are
highly model dependent. Such sensitivity may not be apparent with traditional
approaches because the underlying statistical model is often hidden or poorly
described.

Yet,

exponential loss, the FWBoost algorithm can be rewritten as a variant of
AdaBoost for binary classification. FWBoost algorithms have exactly the same

algorithm with different weights update. This direct connection between

deeper understanding of some of the fundamental differences - such as
entanglement, contextuality and non-locality - between quantum and classical
physics. We first present, based on the work of Abramsky and Brandenburger, how
sheaves, defined over certain posets of physically meaningful contexts, give a
natural setting for capturing and analysing important quantum mechanical
phenomena, such as quantum non-locality and contextuality. We also describe how
this setting naturally leads to a three level hierarchy of quantum
contextuality: weak contextuality, logical non-locality and strong
contextuality. We use these insights in order to classify certain multipartite
entangled states. Almost all of these turn out to be at least logically
non-local, and a number of them even turn out to be strongly contextual. We
further extend this result by showing that all n-qubit entangled states, with
the exception of tensor products of single-qubit and bipartite
maximally-entangled states, are logically non-local. Our proof is constructive:
given any n-qubit state, we present an algorithm which produces n+2 local
observables witnessing its logical non-locality. In the second half of the
thesis we use the same basic principle of sheaves defined over physically
meaningful contexts, in order to present an elegant mathematical language,
known under the name of the Topos Approach, in which many quantum mechanical
concepts, such as states, observables, and propositions about these, can be
expressed. We then show that the language of the Topos Approach is as least as
expressive, in logical terms, as traditional quantum logic. Finally, starting
from a topos-theoretic perspective, we develop the construction of contextual
entropy in order to give a unified treatment of classical and quantum notions

discrete memoryless channels when decoded by a low complexity successive
cancelation (SC) algorithm, the error performance of the SC algorithm is
inferior for polar codes with finite block lengths. The cyclic redundancy check
(CRC) aided successive cancelation list (SCL) decoding algorithm has better
error performance than the SC algorithm. However, current CRC aided SCL
(CA-SCL) decoders still suffer from long decoding latency and limited
throughput. In this paper, a reduced latency list decoding (RLLD) algorithm for
polar codes is proposed. Our RLLD algorithm performs the list decoding on a
binary tree, whose leaves correspond to the bits of a polar code. In existing
SCL decoding algorithms, all the nodes in the tree are traversed and all
possibilities of the information bits are considered. Instead, our RLLD
algorithm visits much fewer nodes in the tree and considers fewer possibilities
of the information bits. When configured properly, our RLLD algorithm
significantly reduces the decoding latency and hence improves throughput, while
introducing little performance degradation. Based on our RLLD algorithm, we
also propose a high throughput list decoder architecture, which is suitable for
larger block lengths due to its scalable partial sum computation unit. Our
decoder architecture has been implemented for different block lengths and list
sizes using the TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. The implementation results
demonstrate that our decoders achieve significant latency reduction and area
efficiency improvement compared with other list polar decoders in the
literature.

that the systole of arcs is a topological Morse function, whereas the systole
of geodesic loops have some degenerate critical points. However, these
degenerate critical points are in some sense the obvious one, and they do not
interfere in the variational study of the function.\par At a nondegenerate
critical point, the systolic curves (arcs or loops depending on the function
involved) decompose the surface into regular polygons. This enables a complete
classification of these points, and some explicit computations. In particular
we determine the global maxima of these functions. This generalizes optimal
inequalities due to Bavard and Deblois. We also observe that there is only one
local maximum, this was already proved in some cases by Deblois.\par Our
approach is based on the geometric Vorono\''i theory developed by Bavard. To
use this variational framework, one has to show that the length functions (of
arcs or loops) have positive definite Hessians with respect to some system of

and paired He interstitials. We have carried out a first-principles density
functional theory investigation into the migration of both a single
interstitial He atom and an interstitial He-pair in bcc (Fe, Mo and W) and fcc
(Cu, Pd and Pt) metals. By identifying the most stable configurations of an
interstitial He-pair in each metal and decomposing its motion into rotational,
translational, and rotational-translational routines, we are able to determine
its migration barrier and trajectory. Our first-principles calculations reveal
that the migration trajectories and barriers are determined predominantly by
the relatively stable He-pair configurations which depend mainly on the
stability of a single He in different interstices. Contrary to atomistic
studies reported in literature, the migration barrier in bcc Fe, Mo, and W is
0.07, 0.07, and 0.08 eV respectively, always slightly higher than for a single
interstitial He (0.06 eV for all three). Configurations of a He-pair in fcc
metals are much more complicated, due to the stability closeness of different
interstitial sites for a single He atom. In both Cu and Pd, the migration of a
He-pair proceeds by moving one He at a time from one tetrahedral site to
neighboring octahedral site; whereas in Pt the two He move simultaneously
because the bridge interstitial site presents an extremely low barrier. The
migration barrier for a He-pair is 0.05, 0.15, and 0.04 eV for Cu, Pd, and Pt,
slightly lower than (in Cu), or similar to (in Pd and Pt) a single He, which is
0.08, 0.15, and 0.03 eV, respectively. The associative motions of a He-pair are
ensured by the strong He-He interactions in metals which are chemical
bonding-like and can be described very well with Morse potentials.

the cross section for elastic scattering of photons on the ion. This is only

obtained at low to moderate photon energies, somewhat beyond the giant dipole

the total absorption cross section. The cross section is continued at higher

procedure is intended for any ion where absorption data is available and for

this sense, the amplifying Transparent Glass Ceramics (TGC), and particularly
the fibers based on this technology, open new perspectives that combine the
mechanical and chemical properties of a glass host with the augmented
spectroscopic properties of embedded nanoparticles. This paper is an
opportunity to make a state of the art on silica-based optical fibers
containing nanoparticles of various types, particularly rare-earth-doped oxide
nanoparticles, and on the methods for making such fibers. In the first section
of this article, we will review basics on standard optical fibers and on
nanoparticle-doped fibers. In the second section we will recall some
fabrication methods used for standard optical fibers, and in the third section
we will describe how TGC fibers can be obtained. This new generation of fibers,
initiated a decade ago, already show very positive outlook and results
departing from those obtained previously in homogeneous silica fibers. The next
few years should see the emergence of new components based on these optical

galactic tidal interactions, provide a potentially significant contaminant to
measurements of cosmic shear. However, these intrinsic alignments are still
poorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear
analyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant
in determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic
ellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we
calculate the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model
from non-linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate
this to the contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured
cross-correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the CMB lensing potential.
On the scales relevant for CMB lensing observations, the squeezed limit of the
gravitational bispectrum dominates the correlation. Physically, the large-scale
mode that sources CMB lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the
intrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular
cross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in
the linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies.
The amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the
formation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift
when the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we
make simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the
correlation of forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current CMB lensing
measurements. We note that cosmic variance can be significantly reduced in
measurements of the difference in the intrinsic alignments for elliptical and
spiral galaxies if these can be separated (e.g., using colour).

the set of stabilizer states forms a 3-design. In addition, our study is
helpful to studying higher moments of the Clifford group, which are useful in

  We analysed the dependence of the final central helium abundance, of the

the main physical parameters that govern the protostellar evolution. The later
is the beginning of the late accretion and the lower are both the central

in ZAMS (Zero Age Main Sequence). In order to produce a relevant increase of
the central helium content the accretion of polluted matter should start at
ages lower than 1 Myr. The inclusion of the protostellar evolution has a strong
impact on the ZAMS models too. The adoption of a very low seed mass (i.e. 0.001

debate. Important diagnostics for discriminating between bulge models include
alpha-abundance trends with metallicity, and spatial abundance and metallicity
gradients. Due to the severe optical extinction in the inner Bulge region, only
a few detailed investigations have been performed of this region. Here we aim
at investigating the inner 2 degrees by observing the [alpha/Fe] element trends
versus metallicity, and by trying to derive the metallicity gradient.
[alpha/Fe] and metallicities have been determined by spectral synthesis of 2
micron spectra observed with VLT/CRIRES of 28 M-giants, lying along the
Southern minor axis at (l,b)=(0,0), (0,-1), and (0,-2). VLT/ISAAC spectra are
used to determine the effective temperature of the stars. We present the first
connection between the Galactic Center and the Bulge using similar stars, high
spectral resolution, and analysis techniques. The [alpha/Fe] trends in all our
3 fields show a large similarity among each other and with trends further out
in the Bulge, with a lack of an [\alpha/Fe] gradient all the way into the
centre. This suggests a homogeneous Bulge when it comes to the enrichment
process and star-formation history. We find a large range of metallicities
(-1.2<[Fe/H]<+0.3), with a lower dispersion in the Galactic center:
-0.2<[Fe/H]<+0.3. The derived metallicities get in the mean, progressively
higher the closer to the Galactic plane they lie. We could interpret this as a
continuation of the metallicity gradient established further out in the Bulge,
but due to the low number of stars and possible selection effects, more data of
the same sort as presented here is necessary to conclude on the inner
metallicity gradient from our data alone. Our results firmly argues for the
center being in the context of the Bulge rather than very distinct.

sequences may not seem compatible with the B-DNA structure because the sequence
information is hidden when it is used for joining the two strands.
Nevertheless, it has to be invoked to account for various biological data.
Using quantum chemistry, molecular mechanics, and hints from recent genetics
experiments I show here that direct recognition between homologous dsDNA is
possible through formation of short quadruplexes due to direct complementary
hydrogen bonding of major groove surfaces in parallel alignment. The
constraints imposed by the predicted structures of the recognition units
determine the mechanism of complexation between long dsDNA. This mechanism and
concomitant predictions agree with available experimental data and shed light
upon the sequence effects and the possible involvement of topoisomerase II in
the recognition.

local active galactic nuclei (AGN) obtained with CanariCam on the 10.4m Gran
Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) as part of an ESO/GTC large program. The sample
includes Seyferts and other low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) at a median distance of
35Mpc and luminous AGN, namely PG quasars, (U)LIRGs, and radio galaxies (RG) at
a median distance of 254Mpc. To date, this is the largest mid-IR spectroscopic
catalog of local AGN at sub-arcsecond resolution (median 0.3arcsec). The goal
of this work is to give an overview of the spectroscopic properties of the
sample. The nuclear 12micron luminosities of the AGN span more than four orders
of magnitude, nu*Lnu(12micron)~ 3e41-1e46erg/s. In a simple mid-IR spectral
index vs. strength of the 9.7micron silicate feature diagram most LLAGN,
Seyfert nuclei, PG quasars, and RGs lie in the region occupied by clumpy torus
model tracks. However, the mid-IR spectra of some might include contributions
from other mechanisms. Most (U)LIRG nuclei in our sample have deeper silicate
features and flatter spectral indices than predicted by these models suggesting
deeply embedded dust heating sources and/or contribution from star formation.
The 11.3micron PAH feature is clearly detected in approximately half of the
Seyfert nuclei, LLAGN, and (U)LIRGs. While the RG, PG quasars, and (U)LIRGs in
our sample have similar nuclear 12micron luminosities, we do not detect nuclear
PAH emission in the RGs and PG quasars.

$y'(x)=yJH(x)y(x)$, $x\in(a,b)$, whose Hamiltonian $H$ is non-negative and
locally integrable, and where Weyl's limit point case takes place at both
endpoints $a$ and $b$. We investigate a class of such systems defined by growth
restrictions on H towards a. For example, Hamiltonians on $(0,\infty)$ of the
form $H(x):=\begin{pmatrix}x^{-\alpha}&0\\ 0&1\end{pmatrix}$ where $\alpha<2$
are included in this class. We develop a direct and inverse spectral theory
parallel to the theory of Weyl and de Branges for systems in the limit circle
case at $a$. Our approach proceeds via - and is bound to - Pontryagin space
theory. It relies on spectral theory and operator models in such spaces, and on
the theory of de Branges Pontryagin spaces.
  The main results concerning the direct problem are: (1) showing existence of
regularized boundary values at $a$; (2) construction of a singular Weyl
coefficient and a scalar spectral measure; (3) construction of a Fourier
transform and computation of its action and the action of its inverse as
integral transforms. The main results for the inverse problem are: (4)
characterization of the class of measures occurring above (positive Borel
measures with power growth at $\pm\infty$); (5) a global uniqueness theorem (if
Weyl functions or spectral measures coincide, Hamiltonians essentially
coincide); (6) a local uniqueness theorem.
  In Part II of the paper the results of Part I are applied to Sturm--Liouville
equations with singular coefficients. We investigate classes of equations
without potential (in particular, equations in impedance form) and
Schr\""odinger equations, where coefficients are assumed to be singular but
subject to growth restrictions. We obtain corresponding direct and inverse
spectral theorems.

Fredricksen and Maiorana) to develop the first polynomial-time algorithm for
decoding minimal de Bruijn sequence of any rank n (it determines the position

outburst. Such transient post-nova supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are the
majority of the observed SSSs in M31. In this paper, we use the post-nova
evolutionary models of Wolf et al. to compute the expected population of
post-nova SSSs in M31. We predict that depending on the assumptions about the
WD mass distribution in novae, at any instant there are about 250-600 post-nova
SSSs in M31 with (unabsorbed) 0.2-1.0 keV luminosity L_x>10^36 erg/s. Their
combined unabsorbed luminosity is of the order of ~10^39 erg/s. Their
luminosity distribution shows significant steepening around log(L_x)~37.7-38
and becomes zero at L_x~2x10^38 erg/s, the maximum L_x achieved in the
post-nova evolutionary tracks. Their effective temperature distribution has a
roughly power law shape with differential slope of ~4-6 up to the maximum
temperature of T_eff~1.5x10^6 K.
  We compare our predictions with the results of the XMM-Newton monitoring of
the central field of M31 between 2006 and 2009. The predicted number of
post-nova SSSs exceed the observed number by a factor of ~2-5, depending on the
assumed WD mass distribution in novae. This is good agreement, considering the

Planarity asks to decide whether $G$ admits a windrose-planar drawing, that is,

  Although the problem is NP-hard in the general case, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm for testing whether there exists a windrose-planar
drawing that respects a given combinatorial embedding. This algorithm is based
on a characterization of the plane triangulations admitting a windrose-planar

windrose-planar drawing, we can construct one with at most one bend per edge
and with at most $2n-5$ bends in total, which lies on the $3n \times 3n$ grid.
The latter result contrasts with the fact that straight-line windrose-planar

Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) has become more interesting as a model

easier to accommodate the relatively high measured value, as compared to the
MSSM. One very distinctive feature of the NMSSM is the possible existence of a
light singlet-like pseudoscalar. As this pseudoscalar may be lighter than the
discovered Higgs boson without conflict with data, it may lead to LHC
signatures rather different to what is usually searched for in terms of new
physics. In these proceedings we will discuss studies concerning the
discoverability of such light pseudoscalars. It is demonstrated that heavier
scalars decaying to pairs of pseudoscalars or pseudoscalars and Z bosons may
lead to discovery in a large part of the parameter space. This is especially
important for the non-SM like of the two lightest scalars, as it may have an
almost 100% branching ratio for decay into pairs of pseudoscalars. In such a

encountered is that the desired symmetries tend to be anomalous in the
prevailing three generation constructions. The reason is that these models
utilise the symmetry breaking pattern $E_6\rightarrow SO(10)\times U(1)_\zeta$
by GGSO projections. Consequently, $U(1)_\zeta$ becomes anomalous. The
spinor--vector duality that was observed in the fermionic $Z_2\times Z_2$
orbifold compactifications is used to construct a phenomenological three
generation Pati--Salam heterotic--string model in which $U(1)_\zeta$ is anomaly
free and therefore can be a component of a low scale $Z^\prime$. The model
implies existence of matter states at the $Z^\prime$ breaking scale, which are
required for anomaly cancelation. Moreover, the string model gives rise to
exotic states, which are $SO(10)$ singlets but carry exotic $U(1)_\zeta$
charges. These states arise due to the breaking of $E_6$ by discrete Wilson
lines and provide natural dark matter candidates. Initial indications suggest
that the existence of additional gauge symmetries at the TeV scale may be
confirmed in run II of the LHC experiment.

  Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study video streaming over a slow fading wireless channel. In a streaming
application video packets are required to be decoded and displayed in the order
they are transmitted as the transmission goes on. This results in per-packet
delay constraints, and the resulting channel can be modeled as a physically
degraded fading broadcast channel with as many virtual users as the number of
packets. In this paper we study two important quality of user experience (QoE)
metrics, namely throughput and inter-decoding delay. We introduce several
transmission schemes, and compare their throughput and maximum inter-decoding
delay performances. We also introduce a genie-aided scheme, which provides
theoretical bounds on the achievable performance. We observe that adapting the
transmission rate at the packet level, i.e., periodically dropping a subset of
the packets, leads to a good tradeoff between the throughput and the maximum
inter-decoding delay. We also show that an approach based on initial buffering
leads to an asymptotically vanishing packet loss rate at the expense of a
relatively large initial delay. For this scheme we derive a condition on the
buffering time that leads to throughput maximization.

inhomogeneous atmospheres and circumstellar envelopes. These have been studied
by a variety of methods on various angular scales. In this paper we explore the
envelope of the well-studied carbon star TX Psc by the technique of
spectro-astrometry. Aims: We explore the potential of this method for detecting
asymmetries around AGB stars. Methods:We obtained CRIRES observations of
several CO $\Delta$v=1 lines near 4.6 $\mu$m and HCN lines near 3 $\mu$m in
2010 and 2013. These were then searched for spectro-astrometric signatures. For
the interpretation of the results, we used simple simulated observations.
Results: Several lines show significant photocentre shifts with a clear
dependence on position angle. In all cases, tilde-shaped signatures are found
where the positive and negative shifts (at PA 0deg) are associated with blue
and weaker red components of the lines. The shifts can be modelled with a
bright blob 70 mas to 210 mas south of the star with a flux of several percent
of the photospheric flux. We estimate a lower limit of the blob temperature of
1000 K. The blob may be related to a mass ejection as found for AGB stars or
red supergiants. We also consider the scenario of a companion object.
Conclusions: Although there is clear spectro-astrometric evidence of a rather
prominent structure near TX Psc, it does not seem to relate to the other
evidence of asymmetries, so no definite explanation can be given. Our data thus
underline the very complex structure of the environment of this star, but
further observations that sample the angular scales out to a few hundred
milli-arcseconds are needed to get a clearer picture.

({\alpha}_ox =-2.37). Furthermore, we were able to verify an X-ray flux of this
source in a reanalysis of the X-ray data taken in 2005. At that time, it was
fainter by a factor of 3.8 +- 0.9 with {\alpha}_ox=-2.55. The X-ray spectrum is
compatible with a normal quasar power-law spectrum ({\Gamma}=1.70_-0.45^+0.57)
with moderate intrinsic absorption (N_H=5.5_-3.9^+6.9 +- 10^21cm^-2) and
reflection. The UV/optical flux of PG 0043+039 has increased by a factor of 1.8
compared to spectra taken in the years 1990-1991. The FUV spectrum is highly
peculiar and dominated by broad bumps besides Ly{\alpha}. There is no
detectable Lyman edge associated with the BAL absorbing gas seen in the CIV
line. PG 0043+039 shows a maximum in the overall continuum flux at around
{\lambda} 2500{\AA} in contrast to most other AGN where the maximum is found at
shorter wavelengths. All the above is compatible with an intrinsically X-ray

design method of invariant manifolds is extended with the addition of
continuous low thrust propulsion. A reachable region is generated and it is
used to determine transfer opportunities, analogous to the intersection of
invariant manifolds. The reachable set is developed on a lower dimensional
Poincare section and used to design transfer trajectories. This is solved
numerically as a discrete optimal control problem using a variational
integrator. This provides for a geometrically exact and numerically efficient
method for the motion in the three-body problem. A numerical simulation is
provided developing a transfer from a $L_1$ periodic orbit in the Earth-Moon

two end hosts to set up communication regardless of the size of distributed

during their evolution, they are predicted to explode as pair-instability
supernovae (PISNe). One critical test for candidate events is whether their
nucleosynthesis yields and internal ejecta structure, being revealed through
nebular-phase spectra at t >~ 1 yr, match those of model predictions. Here we
compute theoretical spectra based on model PISN ejecta at 1-3 years
post-explosion to allow quantitative comparison with observations. The high
column densities of PISNe lead to complete gamma-ray trapping for t >~ 2 years
which, combined with fulfilled conditions of steady state, leads to bolometric
supernova luminosities matching the 56Co decay. Most of the gamma-rays are
absorbed by the deep-lying iron and silicon/sulphur layers. The ionization
balance shows a predominantly neutral gas state, which leads to emission lines
of Fe I, Si I, and S I. For low-mass PISNe the metal core expands slowly enough
to produce a forest of distinct lines, whereas high-mass PISNe expand faster
and produce more featureless spectra. Line blocking is complete below ~5000 A
for several years, and the model spectra are red. The strongest line is
typically [Ca II] 7291,7323, one of few lines from ionized species. We compare
our models with proposed PISN candidates SN 2007bi and PTF12dam, finding
discrepancies for several key observables and thus no support for a PISN
interpretation. We discuss distinct spectral features predicted by the models,
and the possibility of detecting pair-instability explosions among
non-superluminous supernovae.

applications in signal processing, finance, biology and other areas because it
allows to describe interesting and complex data patterns, such as asymmetry or
heavy tails, in contrast with the simpler and widely used Gaussian
distribution. The density associated with a general $\alpha$-stable
distribution cannot be obtained in closed form, which hinders the process of
estimating its parameters. A nonlinear population Monte Carlo (NPMC) scheme is
applied in order to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the
parameters of an $\alpha$-stable random variable given a set of random
realizations of the latter. The approximate posterior distribution is computed
by way of an iterative algorithm and it consists of a collection of samples in
the parameter space with associated nonlinearly-transformed importance weights.
A numerical comparison of the main existing methods to estimate the
$\alpha$-stable parameters is provided, including the traditional frequentist
techniques as well as a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and a likelihood-free
Bayesian approach. It is shown by means of computer simulations that the NPMC
method outperforms the existing techniques in terms of parameter estimation
error and failure rate for the whole range of values of $\alpha$, including the
smaller values for which most existing methods fail to work properly.
Furthermore, it is shown that accurate parameter estimates can often be
computed based on a low number of observations. Additionally, numerical results
based on a set of real fish displacement data are provided.

the analysis of the processes intended to measure and the practical goals of
the measurement. In this study, I propose a simple framework to measure and
predict an individual researcher's scientific performance that takes into
account the main regularities of publication and citation processes and the
requirements of practical tasks. Statistical properties of the new indicator -
a scientist's personal impact rate - are illustrated by its application to a
sample of Estonian researchers.

transition exhibits a clear inverse magnetic catalysis effect for magnetic
fields in the range $ 1 \lesssim eB/m_\pi^2 \lesssim 20 $. As for the BEC-BCS
crossover, the corresponding critical chemical potential is very weakly
sensitive to magnetic fields up to $eB \sim 9\ m_\pi^2$, showing a much smaller
inverse magnetic catalysis as compared to the BEC transition, and displays a
strong magnetic catalysis from this point on.

residue sets has been studied recently, where the correspondence between the
remainders and the integers in each residue set modulo several moduli is not
known. A robust CRT has also been proposed lately for robustly reconstruct a
single integer from its erroneous remainders. In this paper, we consider the
reconstruction problem of two integers from their residue sets, where the
remainders are not only out of order but also may have errors. We prove that
two integers can be robustly reconstructed if their remainder errors are less
than $M/8$, where $M$ is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli.
We also propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm. Finally, we present some
simulations to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The study is

(res. <=0.1pc), in particular the Jeans length and cylinder fragmentation
scale.
  Methods: We observed the prototypical high-mass star-forming filament
IRDC18223 with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) in the 3.2mm continuum
and N2H+(1-0) line emission in a ten field mosaic at a spatial resolution of
~4'' (~14000AU).
  Results: The dust continuum emission resolves the filament into a chain of at
least 12 relatively regularly spaced cores. The mean separation between cores
is ~0.40(+-0.18)pc. While this is approximately consistent with the
fragmentation of an infinite, isothermal, gravitationally bound gas cylinder, a
high mass-to-length ratio of M/l~1000M_sun/pc requires additional turbulent
and/or magnetic support against radial collapse of the filament. The N2H+(1-0)
data reveal a velocity gradient perpendicular to the main filament. Although
rotation of the filament cannot be excluded, the data are also consistent with
the main filament being comprised of several velocity-coherent sub-filaments.
Furthermore, this velocity gradient perpendicular to the filament resembles
recent results toward Serpens south that are interpreted as signatures of
filament formation within magnetized and turbulent sheet-like structures.
Lower-density gas tracers ([CI] and C18O) reveal a similar red/blueshifted
velocity structure on scales around 60'' east and west of the IRDC18223
filament. This may tentatively be interpreted as a signature of the large-scale
cloud and the smaller-scale filament being kinematically coupled. We do not
identify a velocity gradient along the axis of the filament. This may either be
due to no significant gas flows along the filamentary axis, but it may partly
also be caused by a low inclination angle of the filament with respect to the
plane of the sky that could minimize such signature.

dependence, i.e., $ V(\phi(t))=2\Lambda(t)$. We Use the Lagrangian formalism
for a scalar field $\phi$ with standard kinetic energy and arbitrary potential
$V(\phi)$ and apply this model to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW)cosmology. Exact solutions of the field equations are obtained by a
special ansatz to solve the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equation and a particular
potential for the scalar field and barotropic perfect fluid. We present the

  competing dynamics of local signaling events in geometric networks","Updated version of the paper",,,,"q-bio.MN math.DS physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Networks are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering. A number of
methods, including some from our own group, have explored how one goes about
computing or predicting the dynamics of networks given information about
internal models of individual nodes and network connectivity, possibly with
additional information provided by statistical or descriptive metrics that
characterize the network. But what can be inferred about network dynamics when
there is no knowledge or information about the internal model or dynamics of
participating nodes? Here, we explore how connected subsets of nodes
competitively interact in order to activate a common downstream node they
connect into. We achieve this by assuming a simple set of rules borrowed from
neurophysiology. The model we develop reflects a local process from which
global network dynamics emerges. We call this model a competitive refractory
dynanics model. It is derived from a consideration of spatial and temporal
summation in biological neurons, whereby summating post synaptic potentials
(PSPs) along the dendritic tree contribute towards the membrane potential at
the initial segment reaching a threshold potential. We first show how the
'winning node' or set of 'winning' nodes that achieve activation of a
downstream node is computable by the model. We then derive a formal definition
of optimized network signaling within our framework. We define a ratio between
the signaling latencies on the edges of the network and the internal time it
takes individual nodes to process incoming signals. We show that an optimal
ratio is one where the speed of information propagation between connected nodes
does not exceed the internal dynamic time scale of the nodes. We then show how
we can use these results to arrive at a unique interpretation for the
prevalence of the small world network topology in natural and engineered
systems.
