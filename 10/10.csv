first-principles calculations. We do so by constraining a specific component of
the electric displacement field along a variety of structural paths, and by
monitoring the evolution of the relevant physical properties of the crystal
along the way. We find a complex interplay of ferroelectric, antiferroelectric
and antiferrodistortive degrees of freedom that leads to an unusually rich
electrical phase diagram, which strongly departs from the paradigmatic
double-well model of simpler ferroelectric materials. In particular, we show
that many of the structural phases that were recently reported in the
literature, e.g. those characterized by a giant aspect ratio, can be accessed
via application of an external electric field starting from the $R3c$ ground
state. Our results also reveal ways in which non-polar distortions (e.g., the
antiferrodistortive ones associated with rotations of the oxygen octahedra in
the perovskite lattice) can be controlled by means of applied electric fields,
as well as the basic features characterizing the switching between the
ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases of BiFeO$_{3}$. We discuss the
multi-mode couplings behind this wealth of effects, while highlighting the
implications of our work as regards both theoretical and experimental

subdivision surfaces for boundary description with immersed finite elements for
the discretisation of the primal and adjoint problems of optimisation. Similar
to wavelets multiresolution surfaces represent the domain boundary using a
coarse control mesh and a sequence of detail vectors. Based on the
multiresolution decomposition efficient and fast algorithms are available for
reconstructing control meshes of varying fineness. During shape optimisation
the vertex coordinates of control meshes are updated using the computed shape
gradient information. By virtue of the multiresolution editing semantics,
updating the coarse control mesh vertex coordinates leads to large-scale
geometry changes and, conversely, updating the fine control mesh coordinates
leads to small-scale geometry changes. In our computations we start by
optimising the coarsest control mesh and refine it each time the cost function
reaches a minimum. This approach effectively prevents the appearance of
non-physical boundary geometry oscillations and control mesh pathologies, like
inverted elements. Independent of the fineness of the control mesh used for
optimisation, on the immersed finite element grid the domain boundary is always
represented with a relatively fine control mesh of fixed resolution. With the
immersed finite element method there is no need to maintain an analysis
suitable domain mesh. In some of the presented two- and three-dimensional
elasticity examples the topology derivative is used for creating new holes

derive a new stability criteria that differs from the one obtained for weak
magnetic fields with a poloidal component and reduces continuously to the
hydrodynamic Solberg-H{\o}iland criteria. Three fundamental unstable modes are
found in the locally isothermal limit. They comprise of overstable: (i)
acoustic oscillations, (ii) radial epicyclic (acoustic-inertial) oscillations
and (iii) vertical epicyclic (or vertical shear) oscillations. All three modes
are present for finite ranges of cooling times but they are each quickly
quenched past respective cut-off times. The acoustic and acoustic-inertial
overstable modes are driven by the background temperature gradient. When
vertical structure is excluded, we find that the radial epicyclic modes appear
as a nearly degenerate pair. One of these is the aforementioned
acoustic-inertial mode and the other has been previously identified in a
slightly different guise as the convective overstability. Inclusion of vertical
structure leads to the development of overstable oscillations destabilized by
vertical shear but also has the effect of suppressing the radial epicyclic
modes. Although our study does not explicitly account for non-ideal effects, we
argue that it may still shed light into the dynamics of protoplanetary disk
regions where a strong toroidal field generates as a result of the Hall-shear

varying dose rate and grain size up to a dose of 1.0 dpa in pure,
polycrystalline tungsten, subjected to a neutron irradiation having a PKA
spectrum corresponding to the High Flux Isotope Reactor. The present study
models defect cluster accumulation in tungsten, but does not consider the
impact of transmutation or pre-existing defects beyond the grain boundary
sinks, with varying grain size. With increasing dose rate, the vacancy cluster
density increases, while the number density of vacancies decreases.
Accordingly, the average vacancy cluster size and the fraction of vacancies
that are part of visible clusters decreases with increasing dose rate. With
increasing grain size, both the number densities of vacancies and vacancy
clusters decrease, while both the fraction of vacancies in visible clusters and
the average vacancy cluster size increase. This is caused by the
pseudo-ripening of the vacancy clusters due to the longer-lived
self-interstitial clusters in larger grains. The spatial ordering of vacancy
clusters along {110} planes was observed for both grain sizes and all dose
rates studied. Interplanar spacing increases with grain size; however, no clear
dependence on dose or dose rate was observed. The results of this study show
that 1D diffusion of self-interstitial clusters, while necessary, is not
sufficient to form a void lattice, and that the diffusion of vacancies is also
required. A methodology is suggested for choosing the simulation box dimensions
so as to represent more faithfully the effects of one-dimensional migrating
self-interstitial-atom clusters.

peak flux density ratio of 95 GHz to 44 GHz masers is close to unity, which is
two times higher than previous estimates. The flux densities of class I
methanol masers are more closely correlated with the associated BGPS core mass
than those of water or class II methanol masers. Using the large velocity
gradient (LVG) model and assuming unsaturated class I methanol maser emission,

because commodity equipment is more failure-prone. Each architecture has a
different network topology design with a specific level of redundancy. In this

taking the reliability and survivability requirements into account. We consider
the topologies of three alternative data center architecture: Fat-tree, BCube,

data center topology. Our analysis is independent of specific equipment,
traffic patterns, or network protocols, for the sake of generality. We derive
closed-form formulas for the Mean Time To Failure of each topology. The results
allow us to indicate the best topology for each failure scenario. In
particular, we conclude that BCube is more robust to link failures than the
other topologies, whereas DCell has the most robust topology when considering
switch failures. Additionally, we show that all considered alternative
topologies outperform a three-layer topology for both types of failures. We
also determine to which extent the robustness of BCube and DCell is influenced
by the number of network interfaces per server.

practical interest. In a master equation description, where the state of the
environment is unobserved, the effect of signal and noise is described by
system operators only. In this context it is well-known that noise that is
orthogonal on an external signal can be corrected for without perturbing the
signal, while similarly efficient strategies for non-orthogonal signal and
noise operators are not known. Here we make use of the fact that
system-environment interaction typically arises via local two-body interactions
describing the exchange of quanta between system and environment, which are
observable in principle. That two-body-interactions are usually orthogonal on
system operators, allows us to develop error corrected sensing supported by the
observation of the quanta that are emitted into the environment. We describe
such schemes and outline a realistic proof-of-principle experiment in an ion

does not support the existence of multiple identical copies of the world, which
the D-CTC model requires. This has been obscured because he often refers to the

interference by reference to parallel interacting definite worlds. But he
admits that this is only an approximation to Everett. The D-CTC model, however,
relies crucially on the existence of a multiverse of parallel interacting
worlds. Since his model is supplemented by structures that go significantly

explanations, it does not represent a quantum solution to the paradoxes of time
travel.

observations reveal a near edge-on debris disk that has a central cleared
region with radius $\sim$50 AU, and an outer extent $>$500 AU. The HST data
show the outer regions are highly asymmetric, resembling the ''needle''

The present study extends the work of Wang et al. (2015) by using an
alternative approach. We determine the polytropic index directly based on the
polytropic assumption instead of invoking the linear approximation. The same
results are obtained as in the linear approximation, indicating that the
nonlinearity effect is negligible. We find that the flare loop cools slower (by
a factor of 2-4) than expected from the classical Spitzer conductive cooling,
approximately consistent with the result of conduction suppression obtained
from the wave analysis. The modified Spitzer cooling timescales based on the
nonlocal conduction approximation are consistent with the observed, suggesting
that nonlocal conduction may account for the observed conduction suppression in
this event. In addition, the conduction suppression mechanism predicts that
larger flares may tend to be hotter than expected by the EM-$T$ relation

since the start of income measurements in 1947. The overall population consists
of two genders, however, which have different income distributions. The
difference between incomes earned by male and female population has been
experiencing dramatic changes over time. Here, we model the internal dynamics
of men and women PIDs separately and then describe their relative contribution
to the overall PID. Our original model is refined to match all principal
gender-dependent observations. We found that women in the U.S. are deprived of
higher job positions. This is the cause of the long term income inequality
between males and females in the U.S. It is unjust to women and has a negative
effect on real economic growth. Women have been catching up since the 1960s and
that improves the performance of the U.S. economy. It will take decades,
however, to full income equality between genders. There are no new defining
parameters included in the model except the critical age, when people start to
lose their incomes, was split into two critical ages for low-middle incomes and
the highest incomes, which obey a power law distribution. Such an extension
becomes necessary in order to match the observation that the female population
in the earlier 1960s was practically not represented in the highest incomes.

by real GDP per head, the curves of mean income and the portion of rich people
currently observed in three chasing countries one-to-one reproduce the curves

Topological semimetals, on the other hand, can exhibit protected
one-dimensional Fermi lines or zero-dimensional Fermi points, which arise due
to an intricate interplay between symmetry and topology of the electronic
wavefunctions. Here, we study how reflection symmetry, time-reversal symmetry,
SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry, and inversion symmetry lead to the topological
protection of line nodes in three-dimensional semi-metals. We obtain the
crystalline invariants that guarantee the stability of the line nodes in the
bulk and show that a quantized Berry phase leads to the appearance of protected
surfaces states with a nearly flat dispersion. By deriving a relation between
the crystalline invariants and the Berry phase, we establish a direct
connection between the stability of the line nodes and the topological surface
states. As a representative example of a topological semimetal with line nodes,
we consider Ca$_3$P$_2$ and discuss the topological properties of its Fermi
line in terms of a low-energy effective theory and a tight-binding model,
derived from ab initio DFT calculations. Due to the bulk-boundary
correspondence, Ca$_3$P$_2$ displays nearly dispersionless surface states,
which take the shape of a drumhead. These surface states could potentially give
rise to novel topological response phenomena and provide an avenue for exotic
correlation physics at the surface.

death like transitions, for which it is shown that for any state $i$, the rate
of two consecutive transitions from $i-1$ to $i+1$, coincides with the
corresponding rate from $i+1$ to $i-1$. This observation appears to be useful
in deriving well-known, as well as new, results for the Mn/Gn/1 and G/Mn/1

fields ranging from materials science to biology. However, to uncover finer
details approaching the nanoscale with greater sensitivity requires the
development of a radically new sensor technology. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
defect in diamond has emerged as a promising candidate for such a sensor based
on its atomic size and quantum-limited sensing capabilities afforded by long
spin coherence times. Although the NV center has been successfully implemented
as a nanoscale scanning magnetic probe at room temperature, it has remained an
outstanding challenge to extend this capability to cryogenic temperatures,
where many solid-state systems exhibit non-trivial magnetic order. Here we
present NV magnetic imaging down to 6 K with 6 nm spatial resolution and 3
{\mu}T/$\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ field sensitivity, first benchmarking the technique
with a magnetic hard disk sample, then utilizing the technique to image
vortices in the iron pnictide superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.7}$P$_{0.3}$)$_2$

temperatures represents an important advance in state-of-the-art magnetometry,
which will enable future studies of heretofore inaccessible nanoscale magnetism

black holes of a few $\rm 10^9~M_{\odot}$. One of the potential pathways to
explain their formation in the infant universe is the so-called direct collapse
model which provides massive seeds of $\rm 10^5-10^6~M_{\odot}$. An isothermal
direct collapse mandates that halos should be of a primordial composition and
the formation of molecular hydrogen remains suppressed in the presence of a
strong Lyman Werner flux. In this study, we perform high resolution
cosmological simulations for two massive primordial halos employing a detailed
chemical model which includes $\rm H^-$ cooling as well as realistic opacities
for both the bound-free $\rm H^-$ emission and the Rayleigh scattering of
hydrogen atoms. We are able to resolve the collapse up to unprecedentedly high
densities of $\rm \sim 10^{-3}~g/cm^3$ and to scales of about $\rm 10^{-4}$ AU.
Our results show that the gas cools down to $\rm \sim $ 5000 K in the presence
of $\rm H^-$ cooling, and induces fragmentation at scales of about 8000 AU in
one of the two simulated halos, which may lead to the formation of a binary. In
addition, fragmentation also occurs on the AU scale in one of the halos but the
clumps are expected to merge on short time scales. Our results confirm that
$\rm H^-$ cooling does not prevent the formation of a supermassive star and the
trapping of cooling radiation stabilises the collapse on small scales.

for sharing multi-dimensional datasets, as it provides direct access to a range
of different data visualization techniques, is fully-open source, and is a well
defined ISO standard. Unlike other earlier propositions to publish
multi-dimensional datasets via 3-D diagrams, the X3D pathway is not tied to
specific software (prone to rapid and unexpected evolution), but instead
compatible with a range of open-source software already in use by our
community. The interactive HTML branch of the X3D pathway is also actively
supported by leading peer-reviewed journals in the field of Astrophysics.
Finally, this article provides interested readers with a detailed set of
practical astrophysical examples designed to act as a stepping stone towards

XMM-Newton and simultaneous RXTE observations to obtain broad-band energy
coverage of both the disc and the hard X-ray Comptonization components. In most
cases the detection of reverberation lags is hampered by low levels of
variability signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. typically when the source is in a soft
state) and/or short exposure times. The most detailed study was possible for GX
339-4 in the hard state, which allowed us to characterize the evolution of
X-ray lags as a function of luminosity in a single source. Over all the sampled
frequencies (~0.05-9 Hz) we observe the hard lags intrinsic to the power law
component, already well-known from previous RXTE studies. The XMM-Newton soft
X-ray response allows us to detail the disc variability. At low-frequencies
(long time scales) the disc component always leads the power law component. On
the other hand, a soft reverberation lag (ascribable to thermal reprocessing)
is always detected at high-frequencies (short time scales). The intrinsic
amplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source luminosity and the
disc-fraction increase. This suggests that the distance between the X-ray
source and the region of the optically-thick disc where reprocessing occurs,
gradually decreases as GX 339-4 rises in luminosity through the hard state,
possibly as a consequence of reduced disc truncation.

physics during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis involves a careful, and subtle
measurement of the mass fraction of baryons consisting of helium. Recent
measurements of this quantity tentatively support new physics beyond the
standard model but, historically, this method has suffered from hidden
systematic uncertainties. In this letter, I show that a combined measurement of
the primordial deuterium abundance and the primordial helium isotope ratio has
the potential to provide a complementary and reliable probe of new physics
beyond the standard model. Using the recent determination of the primordial
deuterium abundance and assuming that the measured pre-solar 3He/4He meteoritic
abundance reflects the primordial value, a bound can be placed on the effective
number of neutrino species, Neff(BBN) = 3.01 (+0.95 -0.76, with 95 per cent
confidence). Although this value of Neff supports the standard model, it is
presently unclear if the pre-solar 3He/4He ratio reflects the primordial value.
New astrophysical measurements of the helium isotope ratio in near-pristine
environments, together with updated calculations and experimental values of
several important nuclear reactions (some of which are already being
attempted), will lead to much improved limits on possible departures from the
standard model. To this end, I describe an analysis strategy to measure the 3He
I flux emitted from nearby low metallicity H II regions. The proposed technique
can be attempted with the next generation of large telescopes, and will be
easier to realize in metal-poor H II regions with quiescent kinematics.

z>0.3 quasars are important for directly measuring black hole masses in these
distant objects, but so far there have been limited attempts and success given
the practical difficulties of RM in this regime. Here we report preliminary
results of 15 BLR lag measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project, a dedicated RM program with
multi-object spectroscopy designed for RM over a wide redshift range. The lags
are based on the 2014 spectroscopic light curves alone (32 epochs over 6
months) and focus on the Hbeta and MgII broad lines in the 100 lowest-redshift
(z<0.8) quasars included in SDSS-RM; they represent a small subset of the lags
that SDSS-RM (including 849 quasars to z~4.5) is expected to deliver. The
reported preliminary lag measurements are for intermediate-luminosity quasars
at 0.3<~z<0.8, including 9 Hbeta lags and 6 MgII lags, for the first time
extending RM results to this redshift-luminosity regime and providing direct
quasar black hole mass estimates over ~ half of cosmic time. The MgII lags also
increase the number of known MgII lags by several-fold, and start to explore
the utility of MgII for RM at high redshift. The location of these new lags at
higher redshifts on the observed BLR size-luminosity relationship is
statistically consistent with previous Hbeta results at z<0.3. However, an
independent constraint on the relationship slope at z>0.3 is not yet possible
due to the limitations in our current sample. Our results demonstrate the
general feasibility and potential of multi-object RM for z>0.3 quasars.

Here, we demonstrate that despite lacking a local order parameter, topological

nature. We focus on a general construction in which a topological phase is
extensively coupled to a second system, and we argue that in many cases, the
inverse topological order will be induced on the second system. To support our
arguments, we rigorously establish this ""bulk topological proximity effect"" for
all gapped free fermion topological phases and representative integrable models
of interacting topological phases. We present a terrace construction which
illustrates the phenomenological consequences of this proximity effect.
Finally, we discuss generalizations beyond our framework, including how
intrinsic topological order may also exhibit this effect.

  Stationary Accretion Shock Instability","Accepted to New Astronomy; 26 pages, 2 figures, 1 table",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spin of a number of black holes (BHs) in binary systems has been
measured. In the case of BHs found in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) the
observed values are in agreement with some theoretical predictions based on
binary stellar evolution. However, using the same evolutionary models, the
calculated spins of BHs in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) fall short compared
to the observations. A possible solution to this conundrum is the accretion of
high-specific-angular-momentum material after the formation of the BH, although
this requires accretion above the Eddington limit. Another suggestion is that
the observed high values of the BHs spin could be the result of an asymmetry
during Core Collapse (CC). The only available energy to spin up the compact
object during CC is its binding energy. A way to convert it to rotational
kinetic energy is by using a Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI), which
can develop during CC and push angular momentum into the central compact object
through a spiral mode ($m = 1$). Here we study the CC-SASI scenario and
discuss, in the case of LMXBs and HMXBs, the limits for the spin of a
stellar-mass BHs. Our results predict a strong dichotomy in the maximum spin of
low-mass compact objects and massive BHs found in HMXBs. The maximum spin value
($|a_\star|$) for a compact object near the mass boundary between BHs and NSs
is found to be somewhere between 0.27 and 0.38, depending on whether secular or
dynamical instabilities limit the efficiency of the spin up process. For more
massive BHs, such as those found in HMXBs, the natal spin is substantially
smaller and for $M_{\rm BH}\!>\!8~M_\odot$ spin is limited to values
$|a_\star|\!\lesssim\!0.05$. Therefore we conclude that the observed high spins
of BHs in HMXBs cannot be the result of a CC-SASI spin up.

verify the proposed approaches, we compare the performance of RFBN using

confirm the robustness and performance of the proposed hybrid DBF-RFBN concept

systems, and record linkage reduce to the core problem of inner product
similarity join (IPS join): identifying pairs of vectors in a collection that
have a sufficiently large inner product. IPS join is well understood when
vectors are normalized and some approximation of inner products is allowed.
However, the general case where vectors may have any length appears much more
challenging. Recently, new upper bounds based on asymmetric locality-sensitive
hashing (ALSH) and asymmetric embeddings have emerged, but little has been
known on the lower bound side. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of
inner product similarity join, showing new lower and upper bounds. Our main
results are:
  * Approximation hardness of IPS join in subquadratic time, assuming the
strong exponential time hypothesis.
  * New upper and lower bounds for (A)LSH-based algorithms. In particular, we
show that asymmetry can be avoided by relaxing the LSH definition to only
consider the collision probability of distinct elements.
  * A new indexing method for IPS based on linear sketches, implying that our
hardness results are not far from being tight.
  Our technical contributions include new asymmetric embeddings that may be of
independent interest. At the conceptual level we strive to provide greater
clarity, for example by distinguishing among signed and unsigned variants of
IPS join and shedding new light on the effect of asymmetry.

  Equations","17 pp",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider three types of subdiffusion models, namely single-term,
multi-term and distributed order fractional diffusion equations, for which the
maximum-principle holds and which, in particular, preserve nonnegativity. Hence
the solution is nonnegative for nonnegative initial data. Following earlier
work on the heat equation, our purpose is to study whether this property is
inherited by certain spatially semidiscrete and fully discrete piecewise linear
finite element methods, including the standard Galerkin method, the lumped mass
method and the finite volume element method. It is shown that, as for the heat
equation, when the mass matrix is nondiagonal, nonnegativity is not preserved
for small time or time-step, but may reappear after a positivity threshold. For
the lumped mass method nonnegativity is preserved if and only if the
triangulation in the finite element space is of Delaunay type. Numerical
experiments illustrate and complement the theoretical results.

DMD modes and eigenvalues capture the main temporal and spatial scales in the
dynamics belonging to different regimes. Our proposed classification method is
data-driven, robust w.r.t measurement noise, and exploits the dynamics
extracted from the DMD method. Namely, we construct an augmented DMD basis,
with ""built-in"" dynamics, given by the DMD eigenvalues. This allows us to
employ a short time-series of data from sensors, to more robustly classify flow
regimes, particularly in the presence of measurement noise. We also exploit the
incoherence exhibited among the data generated by different regimes, which
persists even if the number of measurements is small compared to the dimension
of the DNS data. The data-driven regime identification algorithm can enable
robust low-order modeling of flows for state estimation and control.

young stellar sources, which we classified into evolutionary classes. We
studied their spatial distribution across the molecular gas structures and

envelope of the central cluster in DR15, and we infer that the removal of this

dispersal timescale could be similar or shorter than the circumstellar disk
dissipation timescale. The presence of other groups with slightly older ages,
associated with much less prominent gaseous structures may imply that the
evolution of young clusters in this part of the complex proceeds in periods

an important role in plasma energization, but the physical mechanisms leading
to dissipation of the turbulent energy remain to be definitively identified.
Kinetic simulations in two dimensions (2D) have been extensively used to study
the dissipation process. How the limitation to 2D affects energy dissipation
remains unclear. This work provides a model of comparison between two- and
three-dimensional (3D) plasma turbulence using gyrokinetic simulations; it also
explores the dynamics of distribution functions during the dissipation process.
It is found that both 2D and 3D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of a low-beta
plasma generate electron velocity-space structures with the same
characteristics as that of linear Landau damping of Alfv\'en waves in a 3D
linear simulation. The continual occurrence of the velocity-space structures
throughout the turbulence simulations suggests that the action of Landau
damping may be responsible for the turbulent energy transfer to electrons in
both 2D and 3D, and makes possible the subsequent irreversible heating of the
plasma through collisional smoothing of the velocity-space fluctuations.
Although, in the 2D case where variation along the equilibrium magnetic field
is absent, it may be expected that Landau damping is not possible, a common
trigonometric factor appears in the 2D resonant denominator, leaving the
resonance condition unchanged from the 3D case. The evolution of the 2D and 3D
cases is qualitatively similar. However, quantitatively the nonlinear energy
cascade and subsequent dissipation is significantly slower in the 2D case.

independent of the size, shape and number of heat sources is derived. The
formalism is based on fluctuational electrodynamics, where fluctuating currents
due to thermal agitation are added to Maxwell's curl equations, and is thus
valid for heat sources in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Using a volume
integral formulation, it is shown that the proposed formalism is a
generalization of the classical electromagnetic scattering framework in which
thermal emission is implicitly assumed to be negligible. The near-field thermal
electromagnetic transport formalism is afterwards applied to a problem
involving three spheres with size comparable to the wavelength, where all
multipolar interactions are taken into account. Using the thermal discrete
dipole approximation, it is shown that depending on the dielectric function,
the presence of a third sphere slightly affects the spatial distribution of
power absorbed compared to the two-sphere case. A transient analysis shows that
despite a non-uniform spatial distribution of power absorbed, the sphere
temperature remains spatially uniform at any instant due to the fact that the
thermal resistance by conduction is much smaller than the resistance by
radiation. The formalism proposed in this paper is general, and could be used
as a starting point for adapting solution methods employed in traditional

cellular networks, enabling a large number of different possible antenna
architectures and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. It is still
unclear which MIMO technique is most desirable as a function of different
network parameters. This paper, therefore, compares the coverage and rate
performance of hybrid beamforming enabled multi-user (MU) MIMO and single-user
spatial multiplexing (SM) with single-user analog beamforming (SU-BF). A
stochastic geometry model for coverage and rate analysis is proposed for
MU-MIMO mmWave cellular networks, taking into account important mmWave-specific
hardware constraints for hybrid analog/digital precoders and combiners, and a
blockage-dependent channel model which is sparse in angular domain. The
analytical results highlight the coverage, rate and power consumption tradeoffs
in multiuser mmWave networks. With perfect channel state information at the
transmitter and round robin scheduling, MU-MIMO is usually a better choice than
SM or SU-BF in mmWave cellular networks. This observation, however, neglects
any overhead due to channel acquisition or computational complexity.
Incorporating the impact of such overheads, our results can be re-interpreted

  This work addresses active learning with labels obtained from strong and weak

extra weak labeler which may occasionally provide incorrect labels. An example
is learning to classify medical images where either expensive labels may be
obtained from a physician (oracle or strong labeler), or cheaper but
occasionally incorrect labels may be obtained from a medical resident (weak
labeler). Our goal is to learn a classifier with low error on data labeled by
the oracle, while using the weak labeler to reduce the number of label queries
made to this labeler. We provide an active learning algorithm for this setting,
establish its statistical consistency, and analyze its label complexity to
characterize when it can provide label savings over using the strong labeler

energy from RF signals radiated by a primary user (PU) to boost its available
energy before information transmission. In this paper, we consider that both
the PU and SU are rational and self-interested. Based on whether the SU helps
forward the PU's information, we develop two different operation modes for the
considered network, termed as non-cooperative and cooperative modes. In the
non-cooperative mode, the SU harvests energy from the PU and then use its
available energy to transmit its own information without generating any
interference to the primary link. In the cooperative mode, the PU employs the
SU to relay its information by providing monetary incentives and the SU splits
its energy for forwarding the PU's information as well as transmitting its own
information. Optimization problems are respectively formulated for both
operation modes, which constitute a Stackelberg game with the PU as a leader
and the SU as a follower. We analyze the Stackelberg game by deriving solutions
to the optimization problems and the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) is
subsequently obtained. Simulation results show that the performance of the
Stackelberg game can approach that of the centralized optimization scheme when
the distance between the SU and its receiver is large enough.

best predictive performance in areas such as speech and image recognition by
hierarchically composing simple local features into complex models. Although
DNNs have been used in drug discovery for QSAR and ligand-based bioactivity
predictions, none of these models have benefited from this powerful

how to apply the convolutional concepts of feature locality and hierarchical
composition to the modeling of bioactivity and chemical interactions. In
further contrast to existing DNN techniques, we show that AtomNet's application
of local convolutional filters to structural target information successfully
predicts new active molecules for targets with no previously known modulators.
Finally, we show that AtomNet outperforms previous docking approaches on a

Andreev reflection becomes vanishing, while the crossed Andreev reflection
becomes dominant in the scattering process. This indicates that our device can
serve as an extremely high-efficiency Cooper-pair splitter. Furthermore,
because of the chiral characteristic, our Cooper-pair splitter is robust

smooth functions such as images. Most wavelet frame based models exploit the
$l_1$ norm of frame coefficients for a sparsity constraint in the past. The
authors in \cite{ZhangY2013, Dong2013} proposed an $l_0$ minimization model,
where the $l_0$ norm of wavelet frame coefficients is penalized instead, and
have demonstrated that significant improvements can be achieved compared to the
commonly used $l_1$ minimization model. Very recently, the authors in

the single $l_0$ minimization based model in terms of better recovered image
quality. In this paper, we propose a truncated $l_0$-$l_2$ minimization model

equal-time correlation -- of an almost planar fluid membrane immersed in a
near-critical binary fluid mixture. One fluid component is usually
preferentially attracted by the membrane, and becomes more concentrated around
it because of the near criticality. This generates osmotic pressure, which
influences the amplitude. The amplitude is also affected by the reversible
dynamics of the mixture, which moves with the membrane. By assuming the
Gaussian free-energy functional and weak preferential attraction, the author
previously showed that a new term is added to the restoring force of the
membrane and tends to suppress the amplitude. Not assuming both of them, but
still focusing on modes with wavelength longer than the correlation length, we
here calculate the amplitude of a tensionless membrane. First, within the
Gaussian model, we solve the governing equations to show that, for long
wavelength, the additional term becomes predominant, although decreased
hydrodynamic effects make its numerical factor approximately half that of the
previous result. The change in the term turns out not to be monotonic with the
wavelength, which is mainly caused by the change in the induced mass. Second,
assuming the critical composition far from the membrane, we calculate the
amplitude beyond the regime of the Gaussian model. The result coincides roughly
with the corresponding result in the Gaussian model if the correlation length
is interpreted as one close to the membrane.

possible to capture time-varying and uncertain travel costs in a road network,
including travel time and fuel consumption. The current paradigm represents a
road network as a graph, assigns weights to the graph's edges by fragmenting
trajectories into small pieces that fit the underlying edges, and then applies
a routing algorithm to the resulting graph. We propose a new paradigm that
targets more accurate and more efficient estimation of the costs of paths by
associating weights with sub-paths in the road network. The paper provides a
solution to a foundational problem in this paradigm, namely that of computing
the time-varying cost distribution of a path.
  The solution consists of several steps. We first learn a set of random
variables that capture the joint distributions of sub-paths that are covered by
sufficient trajectories. Then, given a departure time and a path, we select an
optimal subset of learned random variables such that the random variables'
corresponding paths together cover the path. This enables accurate joint
distribution estimation of the path, and by transferring the joint distribution
into a marginal distribution, the travel cost distribution of the path is
obtained. The use of multiple learned random variables contends with data
sparseness, the use of multi-dimensional histograms enables compact
representation of arbitrary joint distributions that fully capture the travel
cost dependencies among the edges in paths. Empirical studies with substantial
trajectory data from two different cities offer insight into the design
properties of the proposed solution and suggest that the solution is effective
in real-world settings.

  reaction from the Coulomb dissociation of $^{16}$N","8 pages, 8 figures, To be published in Phy. Rev. C",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose : The aim of this paper is to calculate the $^{15}$N($n,
\gamma$)$^{16}$N radiative capture cross section and its subsequent reaction
rate by an indirect method and in that process investigate the effects of
spectroscopic factors of different levels of $^{16}$N to the cross section.
  Method : A fully quantum mechanical Coulomb breakup theory under the aegis of
post-form distorted wave Born approximation is used to calculate the Coulomb
breakup of $^{16}$N on Pb at 100 MeV/u. This is then related to the
photodisintegration cross section of $^{16}$N($\gamma, n$)$^{15}$N and
subsequently invoking the principle of detailed balance, the $^{15}$N($n,
\gamma$)$^{16}$N capture cross section is calculated.
  Results : The non-resonant capture cross section is calculated with
spectroscopic factors from the shell model and those extracted (including
uncertainties) from two recent experiments. The data seems to favor a more
single particle nature for the low-lying states of $^{16}$N. The total neutron
capture rate is also calculated by summing up non-resonant and resonant
(significant only at temperatures greater than 1 GK) contributions and
comparison is made with other charged particle capture rates. In the typical
temperature range of $0.1-1.2$ GK, almost all the contribution to the reaction
rate comes from capture cross sections below 0.25 MeV.
  Conclusion : We have attempted to resolve the discrepancy in the
spectroscopic factors of low-lying $^{16}$N levels and conclude that it would
certainly be useful to perform a Coulomb dissociation experiment to find the
low energy capture cross section for the reaction, especially below 0.25 MeV.

chemical modeling of observed molecular species detected towards it. We

Total hydrogen densities obtained from LVG analysis range between $2 \times

Comparison of models and observations favors a scenario where the cosmic-ray
ionization rate in the CND is high, but precise effects of other factors such

by developing a novel appearance modeling approach to provide accurate

algorithms that only consider the spatial structure of human appearances, we
exploit the temporal dynamic characteristics within temporal appearance
sequences to discriminate different persons. The temporal dynamic makes a
sufficient complement to the spatial structure of varying appearances in the
feature space, which significantly improves the affinity measurement between
trajectories and detections. We propose a feature selection algorithm to
describe the appearance variations with mid-level semantic features, and
demonstrate its usefulness in terms of temporal dynamic appearance modeling.
Moreover, the appearance model is learned incrementally by alternatively
evaluating newly-observed appearances and adjusting the model parameters to be
suitable for online tracking. Reliable tracking of multiple persons in complex
scenes is achieved by incorporating the learned model into an online
tracking-by-detection framework. Our experiments on the challenging benchmark

field evaporation of the III V semiconductor material GaSb reveals strong
variations in charge states, relative abundances of different cluster ions,
multiplicity of detector events and spatial correlation of evaporation events,
as a function of the effective electric field at the specimen surface. These
variations are discussed in comparison with the behaviour of two different
metallic specimen materials, an Al-6XXX series alloy and pure W, studied under
closely related experimental conditions in the same atom probe instrument. It
is proposed that the complex behaviour of GaSb originates from a combination of
spatially correlated evaporation events and the subsequent field induced
dissociation of cluster ions, the latter contributing to inaccuracies in the
overall atom probe composition determination for this material.

introducing a properly defined generator of the evolution nor does it represent
a quantum channel. On the other hand, the map is linear, positive, trace
preserving and unital as well as completely positive, but is not divisible and
therefore non-Markovian. Nevertheless, we provide quantitative criteria for
dynamical emergence of time-coarse-grained Markovianity, for exact dynamics of
an open system, as well as for operationally-defined approximation of a closed
or open many-particle system. A closed system never reaches a steady state,
while an open system may reach a unique steady state given by the L\"" uders-von
Neumann formula; where the smaller the open system, the faster a steady state
is attained. These generic findings extend the standard open quantum systems
theory and substantially tackle certain cosmological issues.

both modes condensed simultaneously. The first principles calculation revealed

also possible transverse modes, which derive their restoring force from

displacement term in transverse direction as the first non-vanishing term in
the potential energy. This results in solution of a composite longitudinal
motion superimposed by a transverse motion propagating along the length
direction identified as a plane polarized phonons. Interestingly, solutions of
the quartic nonlinear equation have been expressed accurately, though
approximately in terms of sinusoidal solutions by modifying the periodicity of
sin function. The phonons along the transverse direction, now with a weakened
frequency compared to the longitudinal has interesting impact- it gives rise to
negative Gruneisen parameter with a value of -1 and is responsible for negative
thermal expansion in the low temperature regime. Similar results of graphene
sheet based on consideration of transverse (surface ripple like) modes to the
planar direction, provides explanation to the observed negative thermal
expansion in low temperature regime. The concept of plane polarized phonons
seems new and interesting. All dynamics of atomic motion, despite involving
quartc nonlinear equation is expressible in terms of simple harmonic motion.
The most important feature of the transverse modes of an open surface or chain
is their dependence on lateral or longitudinal modes, and as soon as more
chains or more surfaces are added, bulk interactions are initiated and
longitudinal dependence of transverse motion is lost and so also very
distinguishing thermodynamic properties.

dopants depends on the temperature range of interest. The thermopowers of both
1 and 2 are negative and at room temperature are optimised by binding with TTF
alone, achieving thermpowers of -600 microvolts/K and -285 microvolts/K
respectively. At much lower temperatures, which are relevant to cascade

mainly concentrate on achieving utmost performance, with little consideration

nonlinear reaction diffusion model which has proven an extremely fast image
restoration approach with performance surpassing recent state-of-the-arts. We
retrain the model parameters, including the linear filters and influence

an optimized nonlinear diffusion model specialized for Poisson denoising. The
trained model provides strongly competitive results against state-of-the-art

advantage, that the diffusion process is well-suited for parallel computation
on GPUs. For images of size $512 \times 512$, our GPU implementation takes less

analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. This framework (termed TOADDI)
is capable of testing whether an individual tract as represented by the major
eigenvector of the diffusion tensor and its corresponding angular dispersion
are significantly different from a group of tracts on a voxel-by-voxel basis.
This work develops two complementary statistical tests based on the elliptical
cone of uncertainty (COU), which is a model of uncertainty or dispersion of the
major eigenvector of the diffusion tensor. The orientation deviation test
examines whether the major eigenvector from a single subject is within the
average elliptical COU formed by a collection of elliptical COUs. The shape
deviation test is based on the two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample test
between the normalized shape measures (area and circumference) of the
elliptical cones of uncertainty of the single subject against a group of
controls. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) and False Non-discovery Rate (FNR)
were incorporated in the orientation deviation test. The shape deviation test
uses FDR only. TOADDI was found to be numerically accurate and statistically
effective. Clinical data from two Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients and one
non-TBI subject were tested against the data obtained from a group of 45
non-TBI controls to illustrate the application of the proposed framework in
single-subject analysis. The frontal portion of the superior longitudinal
fasciculus seemed to be implicated in both tests as significantly different
from that of the control group. The TBI patients and the single non-TBI subject
were well separated under the shape deviation test at the chosen FDR level of
0.0005. TOADDI is a simple but novel geometrically based statistical framework
for analyzing DTI data.

of dynamical triangulation Monte Carlo, we have focused on the methods of Widom

methods can be employed in a variety of problems involving the cell membrane.
Specifically, we have shown that the chemical potential, computed using Widom
insertion, and the relative free energies, computed using thermodynamic
integration and Bennett acceptance method, are excellent measures to study the
transition from curvature sensing to curvature inducing behavior of membrane
associated proteins. The umbrella sampling and WHAM analysis has been used to
study the thermodynamics of tether formation in cell membranes and the
quantitative predictions of the computational model are in excellent agreement

membranes, and this remodeling event is essential for key biophysical processes
such as tubulation, exocytosis, and endocytosis. Curvature-inducing proteins
can act as curvature sensors as well as induce curvature in cell membranes to
stabilize emergent high curvature, non-spherical, structures such as tubules,
discs, and caveolae. A definitive understanding of the interplay between
protein recruitment and migration, the evolution of membrane curvature, and
membrane morphological transitions is emerging but remains incomplete. Here,
within a continuum framework and using the machinery of Monte Carlo
simulations, we introduce and compare three free-energy methods to delineate
the free-energy landscape of curvature-inducing proteins on bilayer membranes.
We demonstrate the utility of the Widom test-particle/field insertion
methodology in computing the excess chemical potentials associated with
curvature-inducing proteins on the membrane-- in particular, we use this method
to track the onset of morphological transitions in the membrane at elevated
protein densities. We validate this approach by comparing the results from the
Widom method with those of thermodynamic integration and Bennett acceptance
ratio methods. Furthermore, the predictions from the Widom method have been
tested against analytical calculations of the excess chemical potential at
infinite dilution. Our results are useful in precisely quantifying the
free-energy landscape, and also in determining the phase boundaries associated
with curvature-induction, curvature-sensing, and morphological transitions.
This approach can be extended to studies exploring the role of thermal
fluctuations and other external (control) variables, such as membrane excess
area, in shaping curvature-mediated interactions on bilayer membranes.

probabilistic stability: complicated, nonlinear functions of a large number of

sharply around their expected values. Information theory plays a key role in
the derivation of concentration inequalities. Indeed, both the entropy method

binding GTP or ATP is hydrolyzed to GDP (guanidine diphosphate) or ADP

assembly is characteristic of the cytoskeleton. To quantitatively evaluate the
assembly kinetics, we propose a nonlinear and non-equilibrium kinetic model,

disassembly oscillates in a chaos-like manner. We use a kinetic analysis of the

equivalent to planning with geometric margins if the scenario doses are
calculated using the static dose cloud approximation. If the scenario doses are
instead calculated more accurately, then our formulation provides a novel
robust planning method that overcomes many of the difficulties associated with
previous scenario-based robust planning methods. In particular, our method
protects only against uncertainties that can occur in practice, it gives a
sharp dose fall-off outside high dose regions, and it avoids underdosage of the
target in ``easy'' scenarios. The method shares the benefits of the previous
scenario-based robust planning methods over geometric margins for applications
where the static dose cloud approximation is inaccurate, such as irradiation
with few fields and irradiation with ion beams. These properties are
demonstrated on a suite of phantom cases planned for treatment with scanned
proton beams subject to systematic setup uncertainty.

continuous density in finite time, and this density can be approximated by that

signals are computationally limited. It is therefore critically important that
available computational resources are used rationally. In this paper we
consider directed searches, i.e. targets for which the sky position is known
accurately but the frequency and spindown parameters are completely unknown.
Given a list of such potential astrophysical targets, we therefore need to
prioritize. On which target(s) should we spend scarce computing resources? What
parameter space region in frequency and spindown should we search? Finally,
what is the optimal search set-up that we should use? In this paper we present
a general framework that allows to solve all three of these problems. This
framework is based on maximizing the probability of making a detection subject
to a constraint on the maximum available computational cost. We illustrate the
method for a simplified problem.

vortex beams (EVB) have been studied for the EVBs interacting with laser field.
In the scenario of paraxial beam, the cumulative effect of the orbit-orbit
interaction of EVBs and laser fields drives the orbital Hall effect, which in
turn produces a shift of the center of the beam from that of the field-free
case towards the polarization axis of photons. Besides, for non-paraxial beams
one can also perceive a similar shift of the center of the beam owing to spin
Hall effect involving spin-orbit interaction. Our analysis suggests that the
shift in the paraxial beams will always be larger than that in non-paraxial
beams.

an equation of state $\omega_\phi=-1$ now and a ghost-free Minkowski limit. We
find that the gravitational waves propagate much faster than the speed of light
unless these models are small perturbations of cubic Galileons and the Galileon
energy density is sub-dominant to a dominant cosmological constant. In this
case, the binary pulsar bounds on the speed of gravitational waves can be
satisfied and the equation of state can be close to -1 when the coupling to
matter and the coefficient of the cubic term of the Galileon Lagrangian are
related. This severely restricts the allowed cosmological behaviour of Galileon
models and we are forced to conclude that Galileons with a stable Minkowski
limit cannot account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the
universe on their own. Moreover any sub-dominant Galileon component of our
universe must be dominated by the cubic term. For such models with gravitons
propagating faster than the speed of light, the gravitons become potentially
unstable and could decay into photon pairs. They could also emit photons by
Cerenkov radiation. We show that the decay rate of such speedy gravitons into
photons and the Cerenkov radiation are in fact negligible. Moreover the time
delay between the gravitational signal and light emitted by explosive
astrophysical events could serve as a confirmation that a modification of
gravity acts on the largest scales of the Universe.

efficiency because if a market is efficient, it is extremely difficult to make

given their risk. However, there is a possibility of making excessive returns
if the market is not efficient. This article analyses the five popular stock
indices of BSE. This would not only test the efficiency of the Indian Stock
Market but also test the random walk nature of the stock market. The study
undertaken in this paper has provided strong evidence in favor of the
inefficient form of the Indian Stock Market. The series of stock indices in the
Indian Stock Market are found to be biased random time series and the random
walk model can't be applied in the Indian Stock Market. This study confirms
that there is a drift in market efficiency and investors can capitalize on this
by correctly choosing the securities that are undervalued.

argument [1] that any causal explanation of Bell-inequality violations must be

model turn out to be robust under variation of the only free parameter, even as
the probabilities deviate from standard quantum theory. The ultimate reason for
this robustness is then traced to a symmetry assumed by the original model. A
broader conclusion is that symmetry-based restrictions seem a natural and
acceptable form of fine-tuning, not an unnatural model-rigging. And if the
Wood-Spekkens argument is indicating the presence of hidden symmetries, this
might even be interpreted as supporting time-symmetric retrocausal models.

scene consisting of multiple interacting idealized targets. Each sensor is a
collocated transmit-receive pair that is capable of transmitting arbitrary
wideband waveforms. We address the problem of finding the space-time transmit
waveform that provides the best target detection performance in the sense of
maximizing the energy scattered back into the receivers. Our approach is based
on earlier work that constructed the solution by an iterative time-reversal
(TR) process. In particular, for the case of idealized point-like scatterers in
free space, we examine the frequency dependence of the eigenvalues of the TR
operator, and we show that their behavior depends on constructive and
destructive interference of the waves traveling along different paths. In
addition, we show how these eigenvalues are connected to the poles of the
Singularity Expansion Method. Our study of the frequency behavior distinguishes
this work from most previous TR work, which focused on single-frequency
waveforms and noninteracting targets. The main result of the present paper is
that the TR process provides an automated, guaranteed way to find the resonant
frequencies of the scattering system.
