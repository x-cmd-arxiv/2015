long-standing discrepancy between theory and observation will have finally been
resolved. However, if the older measurements are found to be correct, then the
agreement between theory and observation is simply a coincidence and the

oscillations of a coronal loop. Using the FLASH code, we solved the 3D ideal
magnetohydrodynamic equations. Our model consists of a straight, density
enhanced and gravitationally stratified magnetic flux tube. We perturbed the
system initially, leading to a transverse oscillation of the structure, and
followed its evolution for a number of periods. A realistic radiative cooling
is implemented. Results are compared to available analytical theory. We find
that in the linear regime (i.e. low amplitude perturbation and slow cooling)
the obtained period and damping time are in good agreement with theory. The
cooling leads to an amplification of the oscillation amplitude. However, the
difference between the cooling and non-cooling cases is small (around 6% after
6 oscillations). In high amplitude runs with realistic cooling, instabilities
deform the loop, leading to increased damping. In this case, the difference
between cooling and non-cooling is still negligible at around 12%. A set of
simulations with higher density loops are also performed, to explore what
happens when the cooling takes place in a very short time (tcool = 100 s). We
strengthen the results of previous analytical studies that state that the
amplification due to cooling is ineffective, and its influence on the
oscillation characteristics is small, at least for the cases shown here.
Furthermore, the presence of a relatively strong damping in the high amplitude
runs even in the fast cooling case indicates that it is unlikely that cooling
could alone account for the observed, flare-related undamped oscillations of
coronal loops. These results may be significant in the field of coronal
seismology, allowing its application to coronal loop oscillations with observed
fading-out or cooling behaviour.

all around the main belt. Most of them are members of the Vesta dynamical
family, but an increasingly large number appear to have no link with it. The
question that arises is whether all these basaltic objects do indeed come from
Vesta. To find the answer to the above questioning, we decided to perform a
statistical analysis of the spectroscopic and mineralogical properties of a
large sample of V-types, with the objective to highlight similarities and
differences among them, and shed light on their unique, or not, origin. The
analysis was performed using 190 visible and near-infrared spectra from the
literature for 117 V-type asteroids. The asteroids were grouped according to
their dynamical properties and their computed spectral parameters compared.
Comparison was also performed with spectral parameters of a sample of HED
meteorites and data of the surface of Vesta taken by the VIR instrument on
board of the Dawn spacecraft. Our analysis shows that although most of the
V-type asteroids in the inner main belt do have a surface composition
compatible with an origin from Vesta, this seem not to be the case for V-types
in the middle and outer main belt.

often in many network applications; for fixed $\delta$, such graphs are simply
called hyperbolic graphs and include non-trivial interesting classes of
""non-expander"" graphs. The main motivation of this paper is to investigate the
effect of the hyperbolicity measure $\delta$ on expansion and cut-size bounds
on graphs (here $\delta$ need not be a constant), and the asymptotic ranges of
$\delta$ for which these results may provide improved approximation algorithms
for related combinatorial problems. To this effect, we provide constructive
bounds on node expansions for $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs as a function of
$\delta$, and show that many witnesses (subsets of nodes) for such expansions
can be computed efficiently even if the witnesses are required to be nested or
sufficiently distinct from each other. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the first such constructive bounds proven. We also show how to find a large
family of s-t cuts with relatively small number of cut-edges when s and t are
sufficiently far apart. We then provide algorithmic consequences of these
bounds and their related proof techniques for two problems for
$\delta$-hyperbolic graphs (where $\delta$ is a function $f$ of the number of
nodes, the exact nature of growth of $f$ being dependent on the particular
problem considered).

dynamic graph approach in which each moment in time is a node and the
similarity in brain states at two different times is an edge, we identify two
primary brain states reminiscent of intrinsic and task-evoked systems. We
demonstrate that time spent in these two states increases over development, as
does the flexibility with which the brain switches between them. Increasing

revisit the algorithms for data generation and analysis due to various
concerns, such as higher degrees of concurrency, deeper memory hierarchies,
substantial I/O and communication constraints. Simulations today typically save
all data to analyze later. Simulations at the exascale will require us to
analyze data as it is generated and save only what is really needed for

sufficiently fast locally, limiting memory and disk usage, and avoiding the

  In this paper, we present a distributed method that enables in-situ data

analysis methods currently follow a centralized approach that moves the
trajectory datasets to a centralized node and processes the data only after
simulations have been completed. Our method, on the other hand, captures
conformational information in-situ using local data only while reducing the
storage space needed for the part of the trajectory under consideration. This
method processes the input trajectory data in one pass, breaks from the
centralized approach of traditional analysis, avoids the movement of trajectory
data, and still builds the global knowledge on the formation of individual

useful in explaining why sometimes, but not always, it is economical to build

smaller, distributed systems. The results indicate that there is not a single
set of infrastructure cost conditions under which optimally-designed networks
will have highly centralized architectures. Instead, as costs increase we find
that average network sizes increase gradually according to a power-law. When we
consider the reliability costs, however, we do observe a transition point at

measure intensity anisotropies and build maps using a linearized formula for
relating them to the temperature blackbody fluctuations. However, this
procedure also generates a signal in the maps in the form of y-type distortions
which is degenerate with the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. These are
small effects that arise at second-order in the temperature fluctuations not
from primordial physics but from such a limitation of the map-making procedure.
They constitute a contaminant for measurements of: our peculiar velocity, the
tSZ and primordial y-distortions. They can nevertheless be well-modeled and
accounted for. We show that the distortions arise from a leakage of the CMB
dipole into the y-channel which couples to all multipoles, mostly affecting the
range $\ell$ < ~400. This should be visible in Planck's y-maps with an
estimated signal-to-noise ratio of about 12. We note however that such
frequency-dependent terms carry no new information on the nature of the CMB
dipole. This implies that the real significance of Planck's Doppler coupling
measurements is actually lower than reported by the collaboration. Finally, we
quantify the level of contamination in tSZ and primordial y-type distortions

resource for quantum key distribution that is device independent on only one
side in that it certifies bipartite entanglement when one party's device is not
characterized while the other party's device is fully characterized. In this
work, we introduce two types of genuine tripartite EPR-steering, and derive two
steering inequalities to detect them. In a semi-device-independent scenario
where only the dimensions of two parties are assumed, the correlations which
violate one of these inequalities also certify genuine tripartite entanglement.
It is known that Alice can demonstrate bipartite EPR-steering to Bob if and
only if her measurement settings are incompatible. We demonstrate that quantum
correlations can also detect tripartite EPR-steering from Alice to Bob and
Charlie, even if Charlie's measurement settings are compatible.

while the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts are conveyed through
intensity modulation of LEDs, the sign information is conveyed through spatial
indexing of LEDs. The proposed DCM scheme, on the other hand, exploits the
polar representation of a complex symbol; it uses only two LEDs (hence the name
`dual-LED'), one LED to map the magnitude and another LED to map the phase of a
complex modulation symbol. These techniques do not need Hermitian symmetry
operation to generate LED compatible positive real transmit signals. We present
zero-forcing and minimum distance detectors and their performance for QCM-OFDM

{\em (spatial modulation-DCM)} scheme, which brings in the advantage of spatial
modulation (SM) to DCM. The proposed SM-DCM scheme uses two DCM BLOCKs with two
LEDs in each BLOCK, and an index bit decides which among the two BLOCKs will be
used in a given channel use. We study the bit error rate (BER) performance of
the proposed schemes through analysis and simulations. Using tight analytical
BER upper bounds and spatial distribution of the received signal-to-noise

to that of purely hydrodynamics models, and it is characterized by regular
oscillations which are visible also in the light curves. As the opacity is
decreased, the tori quickly and violently migrate towards the gas-pressure
dominated regime, collapsing towards the equatorial plane. When the spectra of
the $L_2$ norm of the mass density are considered, high frequency
inertial-acoustic modes of oscillations are detected (with the fundamental mode
at a frequency $68 M_{\rm BH}^{-1}\,\rm Hz$), in close analogy to the

external fertilizers, this selective pressure extends to eggs for which
spawning conditions can range from sperm limitation (competition among eggs) to
sexual conflict (overabundance of competing sperm toxic to eggs). Yet existing
fertilization models ignore dynamics that can alter the functional nature of
gamete interactions. These factors include attraction of sperm to eggs, egg
crowding effects or other nonlinearities in per capita rates of sperm-egg
interaction. Such processes potentially allow egg concentrations to drastically
affect viable fertilization probabilities. I experimentally tested whether such
egg effects occur using the urchin $\textit{Strongylocentrotus purpuratus}$ and
parameterized a newly derived model of fertilization dynamics and existing
models modified to include such interactions. The experiments revealed that at
low sperm concentrations, eggs compete for sperm while at high sperm
concentrations eggs cooperatively reduce abnormal fertilization (a proxy for
polyspermy). I show that these observations are consistent with declines in the
per capita rate at which sperm and eggs interact as eggs increase in density.
The results suggest a fitness trade-off of egg release during spawning: as
sperm range from scarce to superabundant, interactions among eggs transition
from highly competitive to cooperative in terms of viable fertilization
probabilities.

tolerance are examined systematically and point processes with rigidity of

determinantal point processes, zero sets of Gaussian entire functions and
perturbed lattices are examined from the point of view of rigidity, and general

exhibit arbitrarily high levels of rigidity (depending on the choice of
parameter value), answering a natural question on point processes with higher
levels of rigidity (beyond the known examples of rigidity of local mass and
center of mass). Our one parameter family is also related to a natural

recently commenced Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array as a worked example to
provide forecasts on astrophysical and cosmological parameter constraints. In
doing so we improve upon previous forecasts in a number of ways. First, we
provide updated forecasts using the latest best-fit cosmological parameters
from the Planck satellite, exploring the impact of different Planck datasets on
21 cm experiments. We also show that despite the exquisite constraints that
other probes have placed on cosmological parameters, the remaining
uncertainties are still large enough to have a non-negligible impact on
upcoming 21 cm data analyses. While this complicates high-precision constraints
on reionization models, it provides an avenue for 21 cm reionization
measurements to constrain cosmology. We additionally forecast HERA's ability to
measure the ionization history using a combination of power spectrum
measurements and semi-analytic simulations. Finally, we consider ways in which
21 cm global signal and power spectrum measurements can be combined, and
propose a method by which power spectrum results can be used to train a compact
parameterization of the global signal. This parameterization reduces the number
of parameters needed to describe the global signal, increasing the likelihood

neuronal dendrite. Each spine contains a synaptic contact site that may connect
its parent dendrite to the axons of neighboring neurons. Dendritic spines are
markedly distinct in shape and size, and certain types of stimulation prompt
spines to evolve, in fairly predictable fashion, from thin nascent morphologies
to the mushroom-like shapes associated with mature spines. This striking
progression is coincident with the (re)configuration of the neuronal network
during early development, learning and memory formation, and has been
conjectured to be part of the machinery that encodes these processes at the
scale of individual neuronal connections. It is well established that the
structural plasticity of spines is strongly dependent upon the actin
cytoskeleton inside the spine. A general framework that details the precise
role of actin in directing the transitions between the various spine shapes is
lacking. We address this issue, and present a quantitative, model-based
scenario for spine plasticity validated using realistic and physiologically
relevant parameters. Our model points to a crucial role for the actin
cytoskeleton. In the early stages of spine formation, the interplay between the
elastic properties of the spine membrane and the protrusive forces generated in
the actin cytoskeleton propels the incipient spine. In the maturation stage,
actin remodeling in the form of the combined dynamics of branched and bundled
actin is required to form mature, mushroom-like spines. Our model identifies
additional factors that plausibly aid the stabilization and maintenance of
spine morphology. Taken together, our model provides unique insights into the
fundamental role of actin remodeling and polymerization forces during spine
formation and maturation.

  disordered solids","242 pages, 37 figures, Ph.D. thesis",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fact that a disordered material is not constrained in its properties in
the same way as a crystal presents significant and yet largely untapped
potential for novel material design. However, unlike their crystalline
counterparts, disordered solids are not well understood. One of the primary
obstacles is the lack of a theoretical framework for thinking about disorder
and its relation to mechanical properties. To this end, we study an idealized
system of frictionless athermal soft spheres that, when compressed, undergoes a
jamming phase transition with diverging length scales and clean power-law
signatures. This critical point is the cornerstone of a much larger ""jamming
scenario"" that has the potential to provide the essential theoretical
foundation necessary for a unified understanding of the mechanics of disordered
solids. We begin by showing that jammed sphere packings have a valid linear
regime despite the presence of ""contact nonlinearities."" We then investigate
the critical nature of the transition, focusing on diverging length scales and
finite-size effects. Next, we argue that jamming plays the same role for
disordered solids as the perfect crystal plays for crystalline solids. Not only
can it be considered an idealized starting point for understanding disordered
materials, but it can even influence systems that have a relatively high amount
of crystalline order. The behavior of solids can thus be thought of as existing
on a spectrum, with the perfect crystal and the jamming transition at opposing
ends. Finally, we introduce a new principle wherein the contribution of an
individual bond to one global property is independent of its contribution to
another. This principle allows the different global responses of a disordered
system to be manipulated independently and provides a great deal of flexibility
in designing materials with unique, textured and tunable properties.

functions of the wave operator on metric perturbations in the de Donder gauge
make it possible to define classical Poisson brackets on the space of
functionals that are invariant under the action of the full diffeomorphism
group of spacetime. He therefore tried to exploit this property to define
invariant commutators for the quantized gravitational field, but the operator
counterpart of such classical Poisson brackets turned out to be a hard task. On
the other hand, the mathematical literature studies often an approximate
inverse, the parametrix, which is, strictly, a distribution. We here suggest
that such a construction might be exploited in canonical quantum gravity. We
begin with the simplest case, i.e. fundamental solution and parametrix for the
linear, scalar wave operator; the next step are tensor wave equations, again
for linear theory, e.g. Maxwell theory in curved spacetime. Last, the nonlinear
Einstein equations are studied, relying upon the well-established
Choquet-Bruhat construction, according to which the fifth derivatives of
solutions of a nonlinear hyperbolic system solve a linear hyperbolic system.
The latter is solved by means of Kirchhoff-type formulas, while the former
fifth-order equations can be solved by means of well-established parametrix
techniques for elliptic operators. But then the metric components that solve
the vacuum Einstein equations can be obtained by convolution of such a
parametrix with Kirchhoff-type formulas. Some basic functional equations for
the parametrix are also obtained, that help in studying classical and quantum
version of the Jacobi identity.

a high-velocity, very collimated nuclear outflow which we interpret as a
molecular jet with a projected length of +-150 pc. Along the jet axis we find
strong velocity reversals where the projected velocity swings from -150 km/s to
+150 km/s. A simple model of a molecular jet precessing around an axis close to
the plane of the sky can reproduce the observations. The velocity of the
outflowing gas is difficult to constrain due to the velocity reversals but we
estimate it to be between 240 and 850 km/s and the jet to precess with a period
P=0.3-1.1 Myr. The CO emission is clumpy along the jet and the total molecular
mass in the high-velocity (+-(60 to 150 km/s)) gas lies between 2e6 Msun (light
jet) and 2e7 Msun (massive jet). There is also CO emission extending along the
minor axis of NGC1377. It holds >40% of the flux in NGC1377 and may be a
slower, wide-angle molecular outflow which is partially entrained by the
molecular jet.
  We discuss the driving mechanism of the molecular jet and suggest that it is
either powered by a very faint radio jet or by an accretion disk-wind similar
to those found towards protostars. The nucleus of NGC1377 harbours intense
embedded activity and we detect emission from vibrationally excited HCN J=4-3
v_2=1f which is consistent with hot gas and dust. We find large columns of H2
in the centre of NGC1377 which may be a sign of a high rate of recent gas
infall. The dynamical age of the molecular jet is short (<1 Myr), which could
imply that it is young and consistent with the notion that NGC1377 is caught in
a transient phase of its evolution. However, further studies are required to
determine the age of the molecular jet, its mass and the role it is playing in
the growth of the nucleus of NGC1377.

reappear. To preserve finiteness, the time delay must be introduced directly at

However, strategies that promote antisocial behaviour are also surprisingly

or rewarding of freeriders who do not contribute to collective enterprises. We
therefore study the public goods game with antisocial and prosocial pool
rewarding in order to determine the potential negative consequences on the
effectiveness of positive incentives to promote cooperation. Contrary to a
naive expectation, we show that the ability of defectors to distribute rewards
to their like does not deter public cooperation as long as cooperators are able
to do the same. Even in the presence of antisocial rewarding the spatial
selection for cooperation in evolutionary social dilemmas is enhanced. Since
the administration of rewards to either strategy requires a considerable degree
of aggregation, cooperators can enjoy the benefits of their prosocial
contributions as well as the corresponding rewards. Defectors when aggregated,
on the other hand, can enjoy antisocial rewards, but due to their lack of
contributions to the public good they ultimately succumb to their inherent
inability to secure a sustainable future. Strategies that facilitate the
aggregation of akin players, even if they seek to promote antisocial behaviour,
thus always enhance the long-term benefits of cooperation.

remain allowed due to cancellations. Most interestingly, in some rare

naturally into a sum of several terms, where the individual terms are
relatively simple but the composite objective function can only be optimized
with iterative algorithms. In this paper, we are interested in optimization
problems of the form F(Kx) + G(x), where K is a fixed linear transformation,
while F and G are functions that may be nonconvex and/or nondifferentiable. In
particular, if either of the terms are nonconvex, existing alternating
minimization techniques may fail to converge; other types of existing
approaches may instead be unable to handle nondifferentiability. We propose the
MOCCA (mirrored convex/concave) algorithm, a primal/dual optimization approach
that takes local convex approximation to each term at every iteration. Inspired
by optimization problems arising in computed tomography (CT) imaging, this
algorithm can handle a range of nonconvex composite optimization problems, and
offers theoretical guarantees for convergence when the overall problem is
approximately convex (that is, any concavity in one term is balanced out by
convexity in the other term). Empirical results show fast convergence for
several structured signal recovery problems.

explanations invoke a degenerate star (white dwarf) which explodes upon
reaching close to the Chandrasekhar limit, by either steadily accreting mass
from a companion star or violently merging with another degenerate star. We
show that circumstellar interaction in young Galactic supernova remnants can be
used to distinguish between these single and double degenerate progenitor
scenarios. Here we propose a new diagnostic, the Surface Brightness Index,
which can be computed from theory and compared with Chandra and VLA
observations. We use this method to demonstrate that a double degenerate
progenitor can explain the decades-long flux rise and size increase of the
youngest known Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3. We disfavor a single degenerate scenario.
We attribute the observed properties to the interaction between a steep ejecta
profile and a constant density environment. We suggest using the upgraded VLA

supernovae in the Local Group of galaxies. This may settle the long-standing
debate over their progenitors.

millimeter-wavelength observations to constrain disk dust and gas masses. The

youth (<50 Myr), but also accretion rates spanning those of classical and

dip depth and WISE-2 excess, which we interpret as evidence that the dipper
phenomenon is related to occulting structures in the inner disk, although this
is difficult to reconcile with the weakly accreting aperiodic dippers. We
consider three mechanisms to explain the dipper phenomenon: inner disk warps
near the co-rotation radius related to accretion; vortices at the inner disk
edge produced by the Rossby Wave Instability; and clumps of circumstellar
material related to planetesimal formation.

accretion, yet somehow super-Earths accreted atmospheres that weigh only a few
percent of their total mass. We show that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths
formed late, as the last vestiges of their parent gas disks were about to
clear. This scenario would seem to present fine-tuning problems, but we show
that there are none. Ambient gas densities can span many (up to 9) orders of
magnitude, and super-Earths can still robustly emerge after $\sim$0.1-1 Myr
with percent-by-weight atmospheres. Super-Earth cores are naturally bred in
gas-poor environments where gas dynamical friction has weakened sufficiently to
allow constituent protocores to merge. So little gas is present at the time of
core assembly that cores hardly migrate by disk torques: formation of
super-Earths can be in situ. The picture --- that close-in super-Earths form in
a gas-poor (but not gas-empty) inner disk, fed continuously by gas that bleeds
inward from a more massive outer disk --- recalls the largely evacuated but
still accreting inner cavities of transitional protoplanetary disks. We also
address the inverse problem presented by super-puffs: an uncommon class of
short-period planets seemingly too voluminous for their small masses
(4-10$R_\oplus$, 2-6$M_\oplus$). Super-puffs easily acquire their thick
atmospheres as dust-free, rapidly cooling worlds outside $\sim$1 AU where
nebular gas is colder, less dense, and therefore less opaque. Unlike
super-Earths which can form in situ, super-puffs migrated in to their current
orbits; they are expected to form the outer links of mean-motion resonant
chains, and to exhibit greater water content. We close by confronting
observations and itemizing remaining questions.

characterized by a power-law relationship between temperature and density, with
a slope determined by the parameter $\gamma$. We describe a new method to
measure $\gamma$ using the ratio of flux curvature in the Lyman-$\alpha$ and
$\beta$ forests. At a given redshift, this curvature ratio incorporates
information from the different gas densities traced by Lyman-$\alpha$ and
$\beta$ absorption. It is relatively simple and fast to compute and appears
robust against several observational uncertainties. We apply this technique to
a sample of 27 high-resolution quasar spectra from the Very Large Telescope.
While promising statistical errors on $\gamma$ appear to be achievable with
these spectra, to reach its full potential, the dependence of the curvature
ratio on the thermal state of the gas in the foreground Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
will require further, detailed forward modelling.

a major limitation of the traditional latent class approach by taking account
of residual dependence among multivariate binary outcome given disease class,

inference. Such ""local dependence"" on a single subject is induced in the model
by nesting latent subclasses within each disease class. Measurement precision

generalize average-case instances (that is the submodular welfare problem (SWP)

studied in the theory community, existing work has focused on tight
approximation guarantees, and the resultant algorithms are not, in general,
scalable to very large real-world applications. This is in contrast to the
average case, where most of the algorithms are scalable. In the present paper,
we bridge this gap, by proposing several new algorithms (including those based
on greedy, majorization-minimization, minorization-maximization, and relaxation
algorithms) that not only scale to large sizes but that also achieve
theoretical approximation guarantees close to the state-of-the-art, and in some
cases achieve new tight bounds. We also provide new scalable algorithms that
apply to additive combinations of the robust and average-case extreme

distributed machine algorithms on parallel machines; 2) data clustering; and 3)
multi-label image segmentation with (only) Boolean submodular functions via

however, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient may be reduced, masking
the strength of the underlying correlation. In response, this article uses

the combined set to substantially below the average of the two. Moreover, even
mixing two sets of articles with the same correlation strength but different

perform the task of Magnetic Resonance (MR) thermal image reconstruction from a
limited number of observed samples on k-space. The key idea of the proposed
approach is to utilize information theoretic techniques to optimally detect
samples of k-space that are information rich with respect to a model of the
thermal data acquisition. These highly informative k-space samples are then
used to refine the mathematical model and reconstruct the image. The
information theoretic reconstruction is demonstrated retrospectively in data
acquired during MR guided Laser Induced Thermal Therapy (MRgLITT) procedures.
The approach demonstrates that locations of high-information content with
respect to a model based reconstruction of MR thermometry may be quantitatively
identified. The predicted locations of high-information content are sorted and
retrospectively extracted from the fully sampled k-space measurements data set.
The effect of interactively increasing the predicted number of data points used
in the subsampled reconstruction is quantified using the L2-norm of the
distance between the subsampled and fully sampled reconstruction. Performance
of the proposed approach is also compared with clinically available subsampling
techniques (rectilinear subsampling and variable-density Poisson disk
undersampling). It is shown that the proposed subsampling scheme results in
accurate reconstructions using small fraction of k-space points and suggest
that the reconstruction technique may be useful in improving the efficiency of
the thermometry data temporal resolution.

It is therefore
important to identify factors affecting citation scores that are unrelated to
scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be taken into account.
Regression is the most powerful statistical technique to identify these factors
and hence it is important to identify the best regression strategy for citation
data. Citation counts tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in
the absence of alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial
regression. Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data
rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better strategy is to
add one to the citations, take their log and then use the general linear
(ordinary least squares) model for regression (e.g., multiple linear
regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear model without the log.
Reasonable results can also be obtained if all the zero citations are
discarded, the log is taken of the remaining citation counts and then the
general linear model is used, or if the generalised linear model is used with
the continuous lognormal distribution. Similar approaches are recommended for
altmetric data, if it proves to be lognormally distributed.

Boltzmann models recover flow regimes beyond the Navier-Stokes level we observe
for several models significant deviations from reference results. We found this
to be caused by their inability to recover the Maxwell boundary condition
exactly. By using supplementary conditions for the gas-surface interaction it
is shown how to systematically generate discrete velocity models of any order
with the inherent ability to fulfill the diffuse Maxwell boundary condition
accurately. Both high-order quadratures and an exact representation of the

quantum dots in Si/SiGe heterostructures were formed on top of strain-graded
virtual substrates. The strain grading process necessarily introduces misfit
dislocations into a heterostructure, and these defects introduce lateral strain
inhomogeneities, mosaic tilt, and threading dislocations. The use of a SiGe
nanomembrane as the virtual substrate enables the strain relaxation to be
entirely elastic, eliminating the need for misfit dislocations. However, in
this approach the formation of the heterostructure is more complicated,
involving two separate epitaxial growth procedures separated by a wet-transfer
process that results in a buried non-epitaxial interface 625 nm from the
quantum dot. We demonstrate that in spite of this buried interface in close
proximity to the device, a double quantum dot can be formed that is
controllable enough to enable tuning of the inter-dot tunnel coupling, the
identification of spin states, and the measurement of a singlet-to-triplet
transition as a function of an applied magnetic field.

  Efficient Algorithms for Eigenvector Computation","Manuscript outdated. Updated version at arxiv:1605.08754",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG math.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide faster algorithms and improved sample complexities for
approximating the top eigenvector of a matrix.
  Offline Setting: Given an $n \times d$ matrix $A$, we show how to compute an
$\epsilon$ approximate top eigenvector in time $\tilde O ( [nnz(A) + \frac{d
\cdot sr(A)}{gap^2}]\cdot \log 1/\epsilon )$ and $\tilde O([\frac{nnz(A)^{3/4}
(d \cdot sr(A))^{1/4}}{\sqrt{gap}}]\cdot \log1/\epsilon )$. Here $sr(A)$ is the
stable rank and $gap$ is the multiplicative eigenvalue gap. By separating the
$gap$ dependence from $nnz(A)$ we improve on the classic power and Lanczos
methods. We also improve prior work using fast subspace embeddings and
stochastic optimization, giving significantly improved dependencies on $sr(A)$
and $\epsilon$. Our second running time improves this further when $nnz(A) \le
\frac{d\cdot sr(A)}{gap^2}$.
  Online Setting: Given a distribution $D$ with covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and
a vector $x_0$ which is an $O(gap)$ approximate top eigenvector for $\Sigma$,
we show how to refine to an $\epsilon$ approximation using $\tilde
O(\frac{v(D)}{gap^2} + \frac{v(D)}{gap \cdot \epsilon})$ samples from $D$. Here
$v(D)$ is a natural variance measure. Combining our algorithm with previous
work to initialize $x_0$, we obtain a number of improved sample complexity and
runtime results. For general distributions, we achieve asymptotically optimal
accuracy as a function of sample size as the number of samples grows large.
  Our results center around a robust analysis of the classic method of
shift-and-invert preconditioning to reduce eigenvector computation to
approximately solving a sequence of linear systems. We then apply fast SVRG
based approximate system solvers to achieve our claims. We believe our results
suggest the general effectiveness of shift-and-invert based approaches and
imply that further computational gains may be reaped in practice.

meaningful way. Such an automated system is crucial for deriving insights from
complex datasets found in many big data applications such as scientific and

  AIDE relies on a seamless integration of classification algorithms and data
management optimization techniques that collectively strive to accurately learn
the user interests based on his relevance feedback on strategically collected
samples. We present a number of exploration techniques as well as optimizations
that minimize the number of samples presented to the user while offering
interactive performance. AIDE can deliver highly accurate query predictions for
very common conjunctive queries with small user effort while, given a
reasonable number of samples, it can predict with high accuracy complex
disjunctive queries. It provides interactive performance as it limits the user
wait time per iteration of exploration to less than a few seconds.

learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by
deriving tight sample complexity bounds. However, in many real-world
applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded
period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer
service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic
fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity
exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of
episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC
guarantee). In this paper, we derive an upper PAC bound $\tilde
O(\frac{|\mathcal S|^2 |\mathcal A| H^2}{\epsilon^2} \ln\frac 1 \delta)$ and a
lower PAC bound $\tilde \Omega(\frac{|\mathcal S| |\mathcal A| H^2}{\epsilon^2}
\ln \frac 1 {\delta + c})$ that match up to log-terms and an additional linear
dependency on the number of states $|\mathcal S|$. The lower bound is the first
of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound leverages Bernstein's inequality
to improve on previous bounds for episodic finite-horizon MDPs which have a
time-horizon dependency of at least $H^3$.

(U and V). Interestingly, these QPOs are at half the X-ray QPO frequency at
0.16 Hz, which is classified as the type-C QPO; a weak sub-harmonic close to
the IR and optical QPO frequency is also detected in X-rays. The broad band
sub-second time scale variability is strongly correlated in IR/X-ray bands,
with X-rays leading the IR by over 100 ms. This short time delay, shape of the
cross correlation function and spectral energy distribution strongly indicate
that this broad band variable IR emission is the synchrotron emission from the
jet. A jet origin for the IR QPO is strongly favoured, but cannot be
definitively established with the current data. The spectral energy
distribution indicates a thermal disc origin for the bulk of the optical
emission, but the origin of the optical QPO is unclear. We discuss our findings

blind HU criterion, advocated by Craig in early 1990's, considers the vertices
of the minimum-volume enclosing simplex of the data cloud as good endmember
estimates, and it has been empirically and theoretically found effective even
in the scenario of no pure pixels. However, such kind of algorithms may suffer
from heavy simplex volume computations in numerical optimization, etc. In this
work, without involving any simplex volume computations, by exploiting a convex
geometry fact that a simplest simplex of N vertices can be defined by N
associated hyperplanes, we propose a fast blind HU algorithm, for which each of

constructed from N-1 affinely independent data pixels, together with an
endmember identifiability analysis for its performance support. Without
resorting to numerical optimization, the devised algorithm searches for the

spin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar
spin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking. We consider a range of
planet masses ($0.3-5\,M_J$) and initial semi-major axes ($1-5$AU), different
properties for the host star, and varying tidal dissipation strengths. The
fraction of systems that result in HJs depends on planet mass and stellar type,
with $f_{\rm HJ} = 1-4\%$ (depending on tidal dissipation strength) for
$M_p=1\,M_J$, and larger (up to $8\%$) for more massive planets. The production
efficiency of ""hot Saturns"" ($M_p=0.3M_J$) is much lower, because most
migrating planets are tidally disrupted. We find that the fraction of systems
that result in either HJ formation or tidal disruption, $f_{\rm mig} \simeq
11-14\%$ is roughly constant, having little variation with planet mass, stellar
type and tidal dissipation strength. This ""universal"" migration fraction can be
understood qualitatively from analytical migration criteria based on the
properties of octupole LK oscillations. The distribution of final HJ stellar
obliquities exhibits a complex dependence on the planet mass and stellar type.
For $M_p = (1-3)M_J$, the distribution is always bimodal, with peaks around
$30^{\circ}$ and $130^{\circ}$. The distribution for $5M_J$ planets depends on
host stellar type, with a preference for low obliquities for solar-type stars,
and higher obliquities for more massive ($1.4M_{\odot}$) stars.

Methods. We used data from XMM-Newton, the Australian Telescope Compact Array,
and the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey to study their broadband emission
and used Spitzer and HI data to gain a picture of their environments. We
performed a multi-wavelength morphological study and detailed radio and X-ray
spectral analyses to determine their physical characteristics. Results. Both
remnants were found to have bright X-ray cores, dominated by Fe L-shell
emission, consistent with reverse shock heated ejecta with determined Fe masses
in agreement with Type Ia explosion yields. A soft X-ray shell, consistent with
swept-up interstellar medium, was observed in MCSNR J0506-7025, suggestive of a
remnant in the Sedov phase. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedov
self-similar solution, we estimated the age of MCSNR J0506-7025 to be ~16-28
kyr, with an initial explosion energy of (0.07-0.84)x10^51 erg. A soft shell
was absent in MCSNR J0527-7104, with only ejecta emission visible in an
extremely elongated morphology extending beyond the optical shell. We suggest
that the blast wave has broken out into a low density cavity, allowing the
shock heated ejecta to escape. We found that the radio spectral index of MCSNR
J0506-7025 is consistent with the standard ~0.5 for SNRs. Radio polarisation at
6 cm indicates a higher degree of polarisation along the western front and at
the eastern knot, with a mean fractional polarisation across the remnant of
P~(20 \pm 6)%. Conclusions. The detection of Fe-rich ejecta in the remnants
suggests that both resulted from Type Ia explosions. The newly identified
Fe-rich cores in MCSNR J0506-7025 and MCSNR J0527-7104 makes them members of
the expanding class of evolved Fe-rich remnants in the Magellanic Clouds.

Both gas inflow and gas outflow reduce a gas-phase abundance of heavy elements

exclude the stellar nucleosynthesis from consideration, we analyze for the
sample of 14 spiral galaxies the radial distribution of the effective yield of
oxygen $y_{eff}$, which would be identical to the true stellar yield (per
stellar generation) $y_o$ if the evolution followed the closed box model. As
the initial data for gas-phase abundance we used the O/H radial profiles from
Moustakas, Kennicutt, Tremonti et al. (2010), based on two different
calibrations (Pilyugin & Thuan 2005 (PT2005) and Kobulnicky & Kewley 2004
(KK2004) methods). In most of galaxies with the PT2005 calibration, which we
consider as a preferred one, the yield $y_{eff}$ in the main disk ($R \ge
0.2~R_{25}$, where $R_{25}$ is the optical radius) increases with radius,
remaining lower than the empirically found true stellar yield $y_o$. This may
indicate the inflow of low-enriched gas predominantly to the inner disk
regions, which reduces $y_{eff}$.
  We show that the maximal values of the effective yield in the main disks of
galaxies, $y_{eff,max}$, anti-correlate with the total mass of galaxies and
with the mass of their dark halo enclosed within $R_{25}$. It allows to propose
the higher role of gas accretion for galaxies with massive halos. We also found
that the radial gradient of oxygen abundance normalized to $R_{25}$ has a
tendency to be shallower in the systems with lower dark halo to stellar mass
ratio within the optical radius, which, if confirmed, gives evidences of the
effective radial mixing of gas in galaxies with the relatively light dark
matter halo.

optimally controlling the phase shift of each element on the reflect-array, the
useful signals for each transmission pair can be enhanced while the
interferences can be canceled. As a result, multiple wireless users in the same

of planet pairs with period ratios just wide of mean motion resonances (MMR)
and a dearth of systems just narrow of them. In a recently published paper
Chatterjee & Ford (2015; henceforth CF15) has proposed that gas-disk migration
traps planets in a MMR. After gas dispersal, orbits of these trapped planets
are altered through interaction with a residual planetesimal disk. They found
that for massive enough disks planet-planetesimal disk interactions can break
resonances and naturally create moderate to large positive offsets from the
initial period ratio for large ranges of planetesimal disk and planet
properties. Divergence from resonance only happens if the mass of planetesimals
that interact with the planets is at least a few percent of the total planet
mass. This threshold, above which resonances are broken and the offset from
resonances can grow, naturally explains why the asymmetric large offsets were
not seen in more massive planet pairs found via past radial velocity surveys.
In this article we will highlight some of the key findings of CF15. In
addition, we report preliminary results from an extension of this study, that
investigates the effects of planet-planetesimal disk interactions on initially
non-resonant planet pairs. We find that planetesimal scattering typically
increases period ratios of non-resonant planets. If the initial period ratios
are below and in proximity of a resonance, under certain conditions, this
increment in period ratios can create a deficit of systems with period ratios
just below the exact integer corresponding to the MMR and an excess just above.
From an initially uniform distribution of period ratios just below a 2:1 MMR,
planetesimal interactions can create an asymmetric distribution across this MMR
similar to what is observed for the Kepler planet pairs.

not manifest at the level of the energy-momentum tensor. As a result, the full
solutions are axially symmetric only, possessing a single (timelike) Killing

Einstein--(complex) scalar field and Einstein--Yang-Mills theories. The basic
properties of these solutions are discussed, looking for generic features. For
example, we notice that the horizon has an oblate spheroidal shape for
solutions with a scalar field and a prolate one for black holes with Yang-Mills

in the holographic stress-tensor. Finally, based on the results obtained in the

angle $\theta_{13}$ using reactor $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ observed via the inverse
beta decay reaction in which the neutron is captured on hydrogen. This
measurement is based on 462.72 live days data, approximately twice as much data
as in the previous such analysis, collected with a detector positioned at an
average distance of 1050m from two reactor cores. Several novel techniques have
been developed to achieve significant reductions of the backgrounds and
systematic uncertainties. Accidental coincidences, the dominant background in
this analysis, are suppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect
to our previous publication by a multi-variate analysis. These improvements
demonstrate the capability of precise measurement of reactor
$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ without gadolinium loading. Spectral distortions from the
$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ reactor flux predictions previously reported with the
neutron capture on gadolinium events are confirmed in the independent data
sample presented here. A value of $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13} =
0.095^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$(stat+syst) is obtained from a fit to the observed
event rate as a function of the reactor power, a method insensitive to the
energy spectrum shape. A simultaneous fit of the hydrogen capture events and of
the gadolinium capture events yields a measurement of $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13} =
0.088\pm0.033$(stat+syst).

represents an attractive solution, as it lifts MMOG operators from the burden

provisioning and operational costs. P2P- based solutions present several
advantages, including the inherent scalability, self-repairing, and natural

select the ideal tradeoff between performance and economical costs. Using

  http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1470543",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major problem facing the realisation of scalable solid-state quantum
computing is that of overcoming decoherence - the process whereby phase
information encoded in a qubit is lost as the qubit interacts with its
environment. Due to the vast number of environmental degrees of freedom, it is
challenging to accurately calculate decoherence times $T_2$, especially when
the qubit and environment are highly correlated.
  Hybrid or mixed electron-nuclear spin qubits, such as donors in silicon,
possess 'optimal working points' (OWPs) which are sweet-spots for reduced
decoherence in magnetic fields. Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs
was previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid
qubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the
nuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding
of the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$.
  I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which
(i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in
multiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath
and (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and
classical-field decoherence. To achieve these, the cluster correlation
expansion was adapted to include electron-nuclear state mixing. In addition, an
analysis supported by experiment was carried out to characterise the nuclear
spin bath for a bismuth donor as the hybrid qubit, a simple analytical formula
for $T_2$ was derived with predictions in agreement with experiment, and the
established method of dynamical decoupling was combined with operating near
OWPs in order to maximise $T_2$. Finally, the decoherence of a $^{29}$Si spin
in proximity to the hybrid qubit was studied, in order to establish the
feasibility for its use as a quantum register.

complicated physiochemical batch process; generally it is difficult to perform

Based on the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) algorithm, we propose
two kinds of controllers, EWMA-I and II controllers for single product process
and mixed product process in semiconductor manufacturing in this paper. For the
single product process, the stabilities of systems with both controllers which
undergo different kinds of metrology delays are investigated. Necessary and
sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability are established.
Routh-Hurwitz criterion and Lyapunov's direct method are used to obtain the
stability regions for the system with fixed metrology delay. By using
Lyapunov's direct method, the stability region is established for the system
with fixed sampling metrology and with stochastic metrology delay. We also
extended the theorems of single product process to mixed product process. Based
on the proposed theorems, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate
the stability of the delay system.

model for the size of the correction and compare it to the results of detailed
reactor simulations for various real existing reactors, spanning 3 orders of

a fungal mycelium can contain millions of genetically diverse but totipotent
nuclei, each capable of founding new mycelia. Moreover a single mycelium can
potentially stretch over kilometers and it is unlikely that its distant parts
share resources or have the same fitness. Here we directly measure how a single
mycelium of the model ascomycete {\it Neurospora crassa} is patterned into
Reproductive Units (RUs); subpopulations of nuclei that propagate together as
spores, and function as reproductive individuals. The density of RUs is
sensitive to the geometry of growth; we detect 50-fold smaller RUs when mycelia
had expanding frontiers than when they were constrained to grow in one
direction only. RUs fragmented further when the mycelial network was perturbed.
In mycelia with expanding frontiers RU composition was strongly influenced by
the distribution of genotypes early in development. Our results provide a
concept of fungal individuality that is directly connected to reproductive
potential, and therefore to theories of how fungal individuals adapt and evolve
over time. Our data show that the size of reproductive individuals is a dynamic

effective field theory in the functional bosonization is written in terms of a
two-form gauge field, which couples to a $U(1)$ gauge field that arises by
gauging the continuous symmetry of the target system (the $U(1)$ particle

insulators as a condensation phase of the $U(1)$ gauge theory (or as a monopole

amplification of coherent states using successive photon addition, $(\hat
a^{\dagger})^2$, where $\hat a^\dagger$ is the photon creation operator. We
compare it with a previous proposal using the photon addition-then-subtraction,
$\hat a \hat a^\dagger$, where $\hat a$ is the photon annihilation operator,
that works as an appropriate amplifier only for weak light fields. We show that
when the amplitude of a coherent state is $|\alpha| \gtrsim 0.91$, the $(\hat
a^{\dagger})^2$ operation serves as a more efficient amplifier compared to the
$\hat a \hat a^\dagger$ operation in terms of equivalent input noise. Using
$\hat a \hat a^\dagger$ and $(\hat a^{\dagger})^2$ as basic building blocks, we
compare combinatorial amplifications of coherent states using $(\hat a \hat
a^\dagger)^2$, $\hat a^{\dagger 4}$, $\hat a \hat a^\dagger\hat a^{\dagger 2}$,
and $\hat a^{\dagger 2}\hat a \hat a^\dagger$, and show that $(\hat a \hat

4}$ exhibit strongest noiseless properties for $|\alpha| \lesssim 0.51$, $0.51
\lesssim |\alpha| \lesssim 1.05 $, and $|\alpha|\gtrsim 1.05 $, respectively.
We further show that the $(\hat a^{\dagger})^2$ operation can be used for
amplifying superpositions of the coherent states. In contrast to previous
studies, our work provides efficient schemes to implement a noiseless amplifier
for light fields with medium and large amplitudes.

possibilities of generating memory effects in simple isolated quantum systems.
By utilizing geometrical effects from a class of lattices supporting flat-bands
consisting of localized states, memory effects could be observed in ultracold
atoms in optical lattices. As the optical lattice continuously transforms from
a triangular lattice into a kagome lattice with a flat band, history-dependent
density distributions manifest quantum memory effects even in noninteracting
systems, including fermionic as well as bosonic systems in the proper ranges of
temperatures. Rapid growth in ultracold technology predicts a bright future for
quantum memory-effect systems, and here two prototypical applications of

recording the mechanical change rate in a coupled system and a rate-controlled
memvalve where the rate of ramping the lattice potential acts as a control of
the remnant density in the lattice.

in context-free languages are exchanged among communicating parties. Unparsing
these documents correctly is as important as parsing them correctly because
errors during unparsing result in injection vulnerabilities such as cross-site
scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. Injection attacks are not limited to the web
world. Every program that uses input to produce documents in a context-free
language may be vulnerable to this class of attack. Even for widely used
languages such as HTML and JavaScript, there are few approaches that prevent
injection attacks by context-sensitive encoding, and those approaches are tied
to the language. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to derive
context-sensitive encoder from context-free grammars to provide correct
unparsing of maliciously crafted input data for all context-free languages. The
presented solution integrates encoder definition into context-free grammars and
provides a generator for context-sensitive encoders and decoders that are used
during (un)parsing. This unparsing process results in documents where the input
data does neither influence the structure of the document nor change their
intended semantics. By defining encoding during language definition, developers
who use the language are provided with a clean interface for writing and
reading documents written in that language, without the need to care about
security-relevant encoding.

approach, where chiral fermion species doublers and their bosonic counter parts
are either identified as super partners or truncated by chiral conditions. We
claim that the super symmetry is exactly kept on the lattice. However the
formulation is nonlocal and breaks lattice translational invariance. We argue
that these features cause no fundamental difficulties in the continuum limit.
Although a naive version of this formulation breaks associativity of the
product of fields we have found a modified super doubler approach that recovers
the associativity and is applicable to super Yang-Mills theory. It turns out
that this formulation is essentially equivalent to the continuum formulation
and thus keeps all the symmetry exact even at a finite lattice constant.
Inspired by this formulation we propose a non-local lattice field theory
formulation which is free of chiral fermion problem and has the same exact
lattice symmetry as continuum theory.

with packet dropouts, additive noises and input power constraints. To overcome
the difficulty of optimally allocating channel resources among different

channels. An adaptive TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) scheduler is
proposed first, which is shown to be able to achieve a larger stabilizability
region than the conventional TDMA scheduler, and is optimal under some special

designed, which provides the necessary and sufficient condition for mean square
stabilization.

weighted norms with the weights specifically defined by the Forchheimer

weighted parabolic Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities and use them to facilitate
the iteration. Moreover, local in time $L^\infty$-bounds are combined with
uniform Gronwall-type energy inequalities to obtain long-time

the multicritical point at which the semimetallic and the spin- and

quantitative corrections as compared to the previous first-order $\epsilon$

is determined by the chiral Heisenberg universality class supplemented by a
decoupled, purely bosonic, Ising sector. At large $N_f$, a novel fixed point
with nontrivial couplings between all sectors becomes stable. At intermediate
$N_f$, including the graphene case ($N_f = 2$) no stable and physically

imaging of hard magnetic films have been studied. Firstly, we show that
topographic images made in tapping mode with probes characterized by the
moderate cantilever stiffness usual for MFM (1--4 N/m), contain artifacts due
to strong probe-sample interactions which lead to probe retraction. As a
result, stiffer cantilevers (e.g. 40 N/m) are better adapted to characterizing
such hard magnetic films. Secondly, imaging with probes coated by a hard
magnetic film leads to phase maps which show a twofold symmetry, with paired
dark/light contrast on opposite domain edges along the direction of the
cantilever. This is due to the tilt of the direction of tip magnetizaiton and
direction of oscillation, with respect to the sample normal. Thirdly, due to
the long-range nature of the stray field produced by hard magnetic films
containing micron-sized domains, MFM phase contrast reflects the stray field
itself, as opposed to that of its spatial derivatives, as is generally the case
in MFM.

L} \propto X^\alpha - V(\phi)$ where $\alpha \geq 1$ and $V$ is a sufficiently
flat potential. In this case the kinetic term in the Lagrangian behaves just
like a perfect fluid, whereas the potential term mimicks the cosmological
constant. For very large values, $\alpha \gg 1$, the equation of state of the
kinetic term drops to zero and the expansion rate of the universe mimicks
$\Lambda$CDM. The velocity of sound in this model, and the associated
gravitational clustering, is sensitive to the value of $\alpha$. For very large
values of $\alpha$ the clustering properties of our model resemble those of
cold dark matter (CDM). But for smaller values of $\alpha$, gravitational
clustering on small scales is suppressed, and our model has properties
resembling those of warm dark matter (WDM). Therefore our non-canonical model
has an interesting new property: while the background universe expands like
$\Lambda$CDM, its clustering properties can resemble those of either cold or
warm dark matter.

cool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar
ages from measured rotation pe- riods and HR Diagram positions. These relations
have few calibrators with known ages for old, long rotation period stars. There
is a significant sample of old Kepler objects of inter- est, or KOIs, which
have both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic
measurements from which ages can be accurately derived. In this work we
determine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs to both
compare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets and
enlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars. We use Kepler
photometric light curves to derive the stellar surface rotation peri- ods while
ages are obtained with asteroseismology using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal
in which individual mode frequencies are combined with high-resolution
spectroscopic pa- rameters. We thus determine surface rotation periods and ages
for 11 planet-hosting stars, all over 2 Gyr old. We find that the
planet-hosting stars exhibit a rotational behaviour that is consistent with the
latest age-rotation models and similar to the rotational behaviour of stars
without detected planets. We conclude that these old KOIs can be used to test
and calibrate gyrochronology along with stars not known to host planets.

Moreover, the set of fixed points of the dynamics form a nontrivial class of

nontrivial parameter ranges and further study their stability. We close several

Therefore, it
is independent of the energy-momentum tensor and is thus not linked to the
dynamics of gravitational fields. In this paper, we explore its possible
thermodynamical property (i.e. its relationship with the black hole entropy).
For a Schwarzschild black hole, the Weyl scalar invariant,
$C_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}C^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$, is proportional to its
Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. This observation inspires us to interpret
$C_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}C^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$ as the entropy density of the
gravitational fields of black holes. A dimensional analysis indicates that this
interpretation is only valid in 5-dimensional space-time. We calculate the
volume integrals of $C_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}C^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$ for the
5-dimensional Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild--anti-de Sitter black holes, and
find that these integrals indeed lead to the correct entropy formulae, only up

multi-way network is a suitable model for 3-user device-to-device
communications. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the capacity
region of the underlying Gaussian 3-way channel (3WC) within a constant gap. To
this end, a capacity outer bound is derived using cut-set bounds and
genie-aided bounds. For achievability, the 3WC is first transformed into an
equivalent star-channel. This latter is then decomposed into a set of
`successive' sub-channels, leading to a sub-channel allocation problem. Using
backward decoding, interference neutralization, and known results on the
capacity of the star-channel relying of physical-layer network coding, an
achievable rate region for the 3WC is obtained. It is then shown that the
achievable rate region is within a constant gap of the developed outer bound,
leading to the desired capacity approximation. Interestingly, in contrast to
the Gaussian two-way channel (TWC), adaptation is necessary in the 3WC.
Furthermore, message splitting is another ingredient of the developed scheme
for the 3WC which is not required in the TWC. The two setups are, however,
similar in terms of their sum-capacity pre-log which is equal to 2. Finally,
some interesting networks and their approximate capacities are recovered as
special cases of the 3WC, such as the cooperative BC and MAC.

the static atomic displacements from the ideal lattice positions and the local
internal strain. The short-range clustering (SRC) of a subset of atoms,
enriched in Hf and Zr takes place perpendicular to the <1 0 0> directions.
Furthermore, it becomes increasingly interconnected as a function of the
annealing time. This is revealed by the evaluation of diffuse XRD intensities,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and atom probe

modeled by molecular dynamics (MD) relaxations. The hardness and compressive

expected from the rule of mixture. The yield strength further increases by 76 %

our quantum capacitance is compared with the density functional theory (DFT).
Our results reveal that the transport gap for quantum capacitance is smaller
than that in conductance measurements due to the presence of localized states
near the band edge. The presence of localized states is confirmed by the
variable range hopping seen in our temperature-dependence conductivity. A large
asymmetry is observed between the electron and hole side. The asymmetric nature
is attributed to the anisotropic band dispersion of BP. Our measurements
establish the uniqueness of quantum capacitance in probing the localized states

determined by the maximization of this 'state-dependent expected utility'.

create a standard evolutionary model in which young and small radio-loud active

compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources, become large-scale radio objects.
However, many details of this evolutionary process are still unclear. We
explored evolution scenarios of radio-loud AGN using new radio, optical and
X-ray data of so far unstudied low luminosity compact (LLC) sources and we
summarize the results in this paper. Our studies show that the evolutionary
track is very 'personalized' although we can mention common factors affecting
it. These are interaction with the ambient medium and AGN power. The second
feature affects the production of the radio jets which if they are weak are
more vulnerable for instabilities and disruption. Thus not all GPS and CSS
sources will be able to develop large scale morphologies. Many will fade away
being middle-aged (10^5 years). It seems that only radio strong, high

the gain medium, the mode proliferation in these sources arises from four wave
mixing rather than saturable absorption. As a result, their optical output is
characterized by the tendency of small intensity modulation of the output

task. Usually, a trade-off between precision and coverage is hard to find, and
it depends on the methodology used to build the lexicon. Manually annotated
lexica provide a high precision but lack in coverage, whereas automatic
derivation from pre-existing knowledge guarantees high coverage at the cost of
a lower precision. Since the automatic derivation of prior polarities is less
time consuming than manual annotation, there has been a great bloom of these
approaches, in particular based on the SentiWordNet resource. In this paper, we
compare the most frequently used techniques based on SentiWordNet with newer
ones and blend them in a learning framework (a so called 'ensemble method'). By
taking advantage of manually built prior polarity lexica, our ensemble method
is better able to predict the prior value of unseen words and to outperform all
the other SentiWordNet approaches. Using this technique we have built
SentiWords, a prior polarity lexicon of approximately 155,000 words, that has
both a high precision and a high coverage. We finally show that in sentiment
analysis tasks, using our lexicon allows us to outperform both the single

that are being used as detectors of gravitational waves (GWs). Given current
sensitivity, projected improvements in PTAs and the predicted strength of the
GW signals, the detection of GWs with PTAs could occur within the next decade.
One way we can improve a PTA is to reduce the measurement noise present in the
pulsar timing residuals. If the pulsars included in the array display
uncorrelated noise, the root mean square (RMS) of the timing residuals is
predicted to scale as $\mathrm{T}^{-1/2}$, where T is the dwell time per
observation. In this case, the sensitivity of the array can be increased by
increasing T. We studied the 17 pulsars in the five year North American
Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) data set to determine
if the noise in the timing residuals of the pulsars observed was consistent
with this property. For comparison, we performed the same analysis on PSR
B1937+21, a pulsar that is known to display red noise. With this method, we
find that 15 of the 17 NANOGrav pulsars have timing residuals consistent with
the inverse square law. The data also suggest that these 15 pulsars can be
observed for up to eight times as long while still exhibiting an RMS that
scales as root T.

represents functions using a tensor-train ansatz by replacing the

contribution of this paper is a framework to compute the FT that employs
adaptive approximations of univariate fibers, and that is not tied to any

detection rate of magnetic fields in Herbig Ae stars can be explained by the
weakness of these fields and rather large measurement uncertainties.
Spectropolarimetric studies involving sharp-lined Herbig Ae stars appear to be
promising for the detection of such weak magnetic fields. These studies offer a
clear spectrum interpretation with respect to the effects of blending, local
velocity fields, and chemical abundances, and allow us to identify a proper
sample of spectral lines appropriate for magnetic field determination.
High-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the three sharp-lined
Herbig Ae stars HD101412, HD104237, and HD190073 have been obtained in recent
years with the HARPS. We used these archival observations to investigate the
behaviour of their longitudinal magnetic fields. To carry out the magnetic
field measurements, we used the multi-line singular value decomposition method.
We discovered that different line lists for HD101412 yield differences in both
the shape of the Stokes V signatures and their field strengths. They could be
interpreted in the context of the impact of the circumstellar matter and
elemental abundance inhomogeneities on the measurements of the magnetic field.
Due to the small size of the Zeeman features on the first three epochs and the
lack of near-IR observations, circumstellar and photospheric contributions
cannot be estimated unambiguously. In the Stokes V spectrum of HD104237, we
detect that the secondary component, a T Tauri star, possesses a rather strong
magnetic field <B_z>=129G, while no significant field is present in the primary
component. Our measurements of HD190073 confirm the presence of a variable
magnetic field and indicate that the circumstellar environment may have a
significant impact on the observed polarization features.

energy-time uncertainty principle is demonstrated in a system composed of two
strongly coupled bosonic modes. Working in the limit of a short interaction
time, we find that the inclusion of the antiresonant terms to the coupling
Hamiltonian leads the system to relax to a state which is not the ground state
of the system. This effect occurs passively by just presence of the
antiresonant terms and is explained in terms of the time-energy uncertainty
principle for the simple reason that at a very short interaction time, the
uncertainty in the energy is of order of the energy of a single excitation,
thereby leading to a distribution of the population among the zero, singly and
doubly excited states. The population distribution, correlations and
entanglement are shown to be substantially depend on whether the modes decay
independently or collectively to an exterior reservoir. In particular, when the
modes decay independently with equal rates, entanglement with the complete
distinguishability of the modes is observed. The modes can be made mutually
coherent if they decay with unequal rates. However, the visibility in the
single-photon interference cannot exceed $50\%$. When the modes experience
collective damping, they are indistinguishable even if decay with equal rates
and the visibility can, in principle, be as large as unity. We find that this
feature derives from the decay of the system to a pure entangled state rather
than the expected mixed state. When the modes decay with equal rates, the
steady-state values of the density matrix elements are found dependent on their
initial values.

developed are transparent to the user, and, as well as allowing up and

  gravitational lensing elliptical galaxies","Accepted for publication in A&A on september 28th, 2015","A&A 585, A84 (2016)","10.1051/0004-6361/201526910",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Luminosity profiles of galaxies acting as strong gravitational lenses can be
tricky to study. Indeed, strong gravitational lensing images display several
lensed components, both point-like and diffuse, around the lensing galaxy.
Those objects limit the study of the galaxy luminosity to its inner parts.
Therefore, the usual fitting methods perform rather badly on such images.
Previous studies of strong lenses luminosity profiles using software such as
GALFIT or IMFITFITS and various PSF-determining methods have resulted in
discrepant results. The present work aims at investigating the causes of those
discrepancies, as well as at designing more robust techniques for studying the
morphology of early-type lensing galaxies with the ability to subtract a lensed
signal from their luminosity profiles. We design a new method to independently
measure each shape parameter, namely, the position angle, ellipticity, and
half-light radius of the galaxy. Our half-light radius measurement method is
based on an innovative scheme for computing isophotes that is well suited to
measuring the morphological properties of gravitational lensing galaxies. Its
robustness regarding various specific aspects of gravitational lensing image
processing is analysed and tested against GALFIT. It is applied to a sample of
systems from the CASTLES database. Simulations show that when restricted to
small, inner parts of the lensing galaxy, the technique presented here is more
trustworthy than GALFIT. It gives more robust results than GALFIT, which shows
instabilities regarding the fitting region, the value of the Sersic index, and
the signal-to-noise ratio. It is therefore better suited than GALFIT for
gravitational lensing galaxies. It is also able to study lensing galaxies that
are not much larger than the PSF. New values for the half-light radius of the
objects in our sample are presented and compared to previous works.

  BG Simulation-based approach",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The BG-simulation is a powerful reduction algorithm designed for asynchronous
read/write crash-prone systems. It allows a set of $(t+1)$ asynchronous
sequential processes to wait-free simulate (i.e., despite the crash of up to
$t$ of them) an arbitrary number $n$ of processes under the assumption that at
most $t$ of them may crash. The BG simulation shows that, in read/write
systems, the crucial parameter is not the number $n$ of processes, but the
upper bound $t$ on the number of process crashes.
  The paper extends the concept of BG simulation to asynchronous
message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures. Byzantine failures are the
most general type of failure: a faulty process can exhibit any arbitrary
behavior. Because of this, they are also the most difficult to analyze and to
handle algorithmically. The main contribution of the paper is a signature-free
reduction of Byzantine failures to crash failures. Assuming $t<\min(n',n/3)$,
the paper presents an algorithm that simulates a system of $n'$ processes where
up to $t$ may crash, on top of a basic system of $n$ processes where up to $t$
may be Byzantine. While topological techniques have been used to relate the
computability of Byzantine failure-prone systems to that of crash failure-prone
ones, this simulation is the first, to our knowledge, that establishes this
relation directly, in an algorithmic way.
  In addition to extending the basic BG simulation to message-passing systems
and failures more severe than process crashes, being modular and direct, this
simulation provides us with a deeper insight in the nature and understanding of
crash and Byzantine failures in the context of asynchronous message-passing
systems. Moreover, it also allows crash-tolerant algorithms, designed for
asynchronous read/write systems, to be executed on top of asynchronous
message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures.

transform (HHT) for the evolution of a 4-Hz low-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillation (LFQPO) around the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1550-564. The
origin of LFQPOs is still debated. To understand the cause of the peak
broadening, we utilized a recently developed time-frequency analysis, HHT, for
tracking the evolution of the 4-Hz LFQPO from XTE J1550 564. By adaptively
decomposing the ~4-Hz oscillatory component from the light curve and acquiring
its instantaneous frequency, the Hilbert spectrum illustrates that the LFQPO is
composed of a series of intermittent oscillations appearing occasionally
between 3 Hz and 5 Hz. We further characterized this intermittency by computing
the confidence limits of the instantaneous amplitudes of the intermittent
oscillations, and constructed both the distributions of the QPO's high and low
amplitude durations, which are the time intervals with and without significant
~4-Hz oscillations, respectively. The mean high amplitude duration is 1.45 s
and 90% of the oscillation segments have lifetimes below 3.1 s. The mean low
amplitude duration is 0.42 s and 90% of these segments are shorter than 0.73 s.
In addition, these intermittent oscillations exhibit a correlation between the
oscillation's rms amplitude and mean count rate. This correlation could be
analogous to the linear rms-flux relation found in the 4-Hz LFQPO through
Fourier analysis. We conclude that the LFQPO peak in the power spectrum is
broadened owing to intermittent oscillations with varying frequencies, which
could be explained by using the Lense-Thirring precession model.

  Wirelessly Powered Communications (Extended Version)","Extended version of the paper with the same title accepted by IEEE
  JSAC",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The implementation of wireless power transfer in wireless communication
systems opens up a new research area, known as wirelessly powered
communications (WPC). In next-generation heterogeneous networks where
ultra-dense small-cell base stations are deployed,
simultaneous-wireless-information-and-power-transfer (SWIPT) is feasible over
short ranges. One challenge for designing a WPC system is the severe near-far
problem where a user attempts to decode an information-transfer (IT) signal in
the presence of extremely strong SWIPT signals. Jointly quantizing the mixed
signals causes the IT signal to be completely corrupted by quantization noise
and thus the SWIPT signals have to be suppressed in the analog domain. This
motivates the design of a framework in this paper for analog spatial
cancellation in a multi-antenna WPC system. In the framework, an analog circuit
consisting of simple phase shifters and adders, is adapted to cancel the SWIPT
signals by multiplying it with a cancellation matrix having unit-modulus
elements and full rank, where the full rank retains the spatial-multiplexing
gain of the IT channel. The unit-modulus constraints render the conventional
zero-forcing method unsuitable. Therefore, the paper presents a novel
systematic approach for constructing cancellation matrices. For the
single-SWIPT-interferer case, the matrices are obtained as truncated
Fourier/Hadamard matrices after compensating for propagation phase shifts over
the SWIPT channel. For the more challenging multiple-SWIPT-interferer case, it
is proposed that each row of the cancellation matrix is constructed as a
Kronecker-product of component vectors, with each component vectors designed to
null the signal from a corresponding SWIPT interferer similarly as in the
preceding case.

the stationary density profiles of the host medium particles around it. These

features: a) We show that, under certain conditions, the terminal velocity of
the driven tracer particle is a nonmonotonic function of the force, so that in
some parameter range the differential mobility becomes negative, and b) the
biased particle drives the whole system into a nonequilibrium steady-state with
a stationary particle density profile past the tracer, which decays

extract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with
increasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition
between the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated
to quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high
temperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the
contribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease
of the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in
terms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a
closer distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At
high temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the
color charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field
strength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In
turn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero
temperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate
increase with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge
associated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both
having the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the
quark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity. The implications
of these results for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon are discussed.

robust in vivo-like PS activity. PS activity formed spatiotemporal patterns
that started at early days in vitro (DIVs) and lasted until the end of the
recording sessions. Initially random-like and sparse PS patterns became robust
after three weeks in vitro (WIVs). They were characterized by a high number of
occurrences and short inter-paired spike intervals (IPSIs). Spatially, the
degree of complexity increased by recruiting new neighboring sites in PS as a
culture matured. Moreover, PS activity participated in establishing functional
connectivity between different sites within the developing network. Employing
transfer entropy (TE) as an information transfer measure, we show that PS
activity is robustly involved in establishing effective connectivities. Spiking
activity at both individual sites and network level robustly followed each PS
within a short time interval. PS may thus be considered a spiking predictor.
These findings suggest that PS activity is preserved in spontaneously active in
vitro networks as part of a robust coding mechanism as encountered in vivo. We
suggest that, presumably in lack of any external sensory stimuli, PS may act as
an internal surrogate stimulus to drive neural activity at different
developmental stages.

time dilation and spontaneous emission between two atomic levels. It has been
shown that gravitational time dilation can be an universal decoherence source.
Here, we consider decoherence induced by gravitational time dilation only in
the situation of spontaneous emission. Then, we obtain that the coherence of
particle's position state depends on reference frame due to the time dilation
changing the distinguishability of emission photon from two positions of
particle. Changing the direction of light field can also result in the
difference about the coherence of quantum superpositions. For observing the
decoherence effect mainly due to gravitational time dilation, time-delayed
feedback can be utilized to increase the decoherence of particle's
superpositions.

optical photons. In particular, cosmic-ray muons are detected as long, straight
tracks passing through multiple pixels. The distribution of track lengths can
be related to the thickness of the active (depleted) region of the camera image
sensor through the known angular distribution of muons at sea level. We use a
sample of cosmic-ray muon tracks recorded by the Distributed Electronic
Cosmic-ray Observatory to measure the thickness of the depletion region of the
camera image sensor in a commercial smart phone, the HTC Wildfire S. The track
length distribution prefers a cosmic-ray muon angular distribution over an
isotropic distribution. Allowing either distribution, we measure the depletion
thickness to be between 13.9~$\mu$m and 27.7~$\mu$m. The same method can be
applied to additional models of image sensor. Once measured, the thickness can
be used to convert track length to incident polar angle on a per-event basis.
Combined with a determination of the incident azimuthal angle directly from the
track orientation in the sensor plane, this enables direction reconstruction of
individual cosmic-ray events.

particle detectors coupled to quantum fields along stationary worldlines, by
testing whether the response of such a detector satisfies the detailed balance
version of the KMS condition at a constant temperature. This relation holds
when the interaction between the field and the detector has infinite time
duration. Operationally, however, detectors interact with fields for a finite
amount of time, controlled by a switching function of compact support, and the
KMS detailed balance condition cannot hold exactly for finite time interactions
at arbitrarily large detector energy gap. In this large energy gap regime, we
show that, for an adiabatically switched Rindler detector, the Unruh
temperature emerges asymptotically after the detector and the field have
interacted for a time that is polynomially long in the large energy. We comment
on the significance of the adiabaticity assumption in this result.

comparatively more tenuous relation between molecular biology and physics in
Brazil and USA. Other slight exceptions are the higher amount of citing of
physicists by chemists in South Korea, of chemists by molecular biologists in

are, by a sizable margin, the most cross-science citing scientists in this
group of three sciences. Physicist are, again by a sizable margin, the least

countries, the strongest cross-science citation is from chemistry to physics
and the weakest cross-science citation is from physics to molecular biology.
Our findings are consistent with a V-shaped backbone connectivity, as opposed
to a Delta connectivity, as also found in a previous study of earlier citation
years.
