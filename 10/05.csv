approach, we examine the thermoelectric properties of hetero-nanoribbons formed
from alternating lengths of graphene and boron nitride. In such structures, the
boron nitride acts as a tunnel barrier, which weakly couples states in the
graphene, to form mini-bands . In un-doped nanoribbons, the mini bands are
symmetrically positioned relative to the Fermi energy and do not enhance
thermoelectric performance significantly. In contrast, when the ribbons are
doped by electron donating or electron accepting adsorbates, the thermopower S
and electronic figure of merit are enhanced and either positive or negative
thermopowers can be obtained. In the most favourable case, doping with the
electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) increases the room-temperature
thermopower to -284 {\mu}v/K and doping by the electron acceptor
tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) increases S to 210 {\mu}v/K. After including both
electron and phonon contributions to the thermal conductance, figures of merit
ZT up to of order 0.9 are obtained.

second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation that is asymptotically
accurate in describing solution dynamics near Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations.
When the nonlinear coefficient in this normal form is complex, which occurs if
the second harmonic of the Hopf bifurcation frequency falls inside the
continuous spectrum of the system, the solution of this normal form will blow
up to infinity in finite time, meaning that solution oscillations near
Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations will strongly amplify and eventually get
destroyed. When the nonlinear coefficient of the normal form is real, the
normal form can admit periodic solutions, which correspond to long-lasting
solution oscillations in the original PDE system. Quantitative comparison
between the normal form's predictions and true PDE solutions is also made in
several numerical examples, and good agreement is obtained.

structure. However prediction of protein function and dynamics from its
sequence and structure is still a fundamental challenge in molecular biology.
Protein classification, which is typically done through measuring the
similarity be- tween proteins based on protein sequence or physical
information, serves as a crucial step toward the understanding of protein
function and dynamics. Persistent homology is a new branch of algebraic
topology that has found its success in the topological data analysis in a
variety of disciplines, including molecular biology. The present work explores
the potential of using persistent homology as an indepen- dent tool for protein
classification. To this end, we propose a molecular topological fingerprint
based support vector machine (MTF-SVM) classifier. Specifically, we construct
machine learning feature vectors solely from protein topological fingerprints,
which are topological invariants generated during the filtration process. To
validate the present MTF-SVM approach, we consider four types of problems.
First, we study protein-drug binding by using the M2 channel protein of
influenza A virus. We achieve 96% accuracy in discriminating drug bound and
unbound M2 channels. Additionally, we examine the use of MTF-SVM for the
classification of hemoglobin molecules in their relaxed and taut forms and
obtain about 80% accuracy. The identification of all alpha, all beta, and
alpha-beta protein domains is carried out in our next study using 900 proteins.
We have found a 85% success in this identifica- tion. Finally, we apply the
present technique to 55 classification tasks of protein superfamilies over 1357
samples. An average accuracy of 82% is attained. The present study establishes
computational topology as an independent and effective alternative for protein
classification.

understand the mechanical and flow behaviour of dense granular matter, and to
explore universal aspects of the transition from fluid to structurally arrested
or jammed states. Considerable attention has recently been focussed on
anisotropic packings of frictional grains generated by shear deformation
leading to shear jamming, which occurs below the jamming density for isotropic
packings of frictionless grains. With the aim of disentangling the role of
shear deformation induced structures and friction in generating shear jamming,
we study sheared assemblies of frictionless spheres computationally, over a
wide range of densities, extending far below the isotropic jamming point. We
demonstrate the emergence of a variety of geometric features characteristic of
jammed packings with the increase of shear strain. The average contact number
and the distributions of contact forces suggest the presence of a threshold
density, well below the isotropic jamming point, above which a qualitative
change occurs in the jamming behaviour of sheared configurations. We show that
above this threshold density, friction stabilizes the sheared configurations we
generate. Our results thus reveal the emergence of geometric features
characteristic of jammed states as a result of shear deformation alone, while
friction is instrumental in stabilising packings over a range of densities
below the isotropic jamming point.

interest in stochastic optimization and iterative estimation procedures.
Stochastic approximations are at the forefront of this recent development as
they yield procedures that are simple, general, and fast. However, standard
stochastic approximations are often numerically unstable. Deterministic
optimization, on the other hand, increasingly uses proximal updates to achieve
numerical stability in a principled manner. A theoretical gap has thus emerged.
While standard stochastic approximations are subsumed by the framework of
Robbins and Monro (1951), there is no such framework for stochastic
approximations with proximal updates. In this paper, we conceptualize a
proximal version of the classical Robbins-Monro procedure. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the proposed procedure has important stability
benefits over the classical Robbins-Monro procedure, while it retains the best
known convergence rates. Exact implementations of the proximal Robbins-Monro
procedure are challenging, but we show that approximate implementations lead to
procedures that are easy to implement, and still dominate classical procedures
by achieving numerical stability, practically without tradeoffs. Moreover,
approximate proximal Robbins-Monro procedures can be applied even when the
objective cannot be calculated analytically, and so they generalize stochastic
proximal procedures currently in use.

challenging. This has prompted an exploration of chemical signatures of CO
freeze-out. We present ALMA Cycle 1 observations of the N2H+ J=3-2 and DCO+
J=4-3 emission lines toward the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD~163296 at
~0.5"" (60 AU) resolution, and evaluate their utility as tracers of the CO snow
line location. The N2H+ emission is distributed in a ring with an inner radius
at 90 AU, corresponding to a midplane temperature of 25 K. This result is
consistent with a new analysis of optically thin C18O data, which implies a
sharp drop in CO abundance at 90 AU. Thus N2H+ appears to be a robust tracer of
the midplane CO snow line. The DCO+ emission also has a ring morphology, but
neither the inner nor the outer radius coincides with the CO snow line location
of 90 AU, indicative of a complex relationship between DCO+ emission and CO
freeze-out in the disk midplane. Compared to TW Hya, CO freezes out at a higher
temperature in the disk around HD 163296 (25 vs. 17 K in the TW Hya disk),
perhaps due to different ice compositions. This highlights the importance of
actually measuring the CO snow line location, rather than assuming a constant
CO freeze-out temperature for all disks.

identified with static magnetism in it. Here, a directional scalar spin chiral
order (DSSCO) phase is introduced that disobeys this basic principle: it breaks
TRS but has no density of static moments. It can be obtained by melting the
spin moments in a magnetically ordered phase but retaining residual broken TRS.
Orbital moments are then precluded by the spatial symmetries of the spin
rotation symmetric state. It can exist in one, two and three dimensions under
different conditions of temperature and disorder. Recently, polar Kerr effect
experiments in the mysterious pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates hinted
at a strange form of broken TRS below a temperature $T_{K}$, that exhibits a
hysteretic ""memory effect"" above $T_{K}$ and begs reconciliation with nuclear
magnetic resonance (which sees no moments), X-ray diffraction (which finds
charge ordering tendencies) and the Nernst effect (which detects nematicity).
Remarkably, the DSSCO provides a phenomenological route for reconciling all
these observations, and it is conceivable that it onsets at the pseudogap
temperature $\sim T^{*}$. A testable prediction of the existence of the DSSCO
in the cuprates is a Kerr signal above $T_{K}$ triggered and trainable by a
current driven along one of the in-plane axes, but not by a current along the
other.

propagating velocity perturbations in coronal loops. These ubiquitous
perturbations are observed to undergo strong damping as they propagate. Using
3D numerical simulations of footpoint-driven transverse waves propagating in a
coronal plasma with a cylindrical density structure, in combination with
analytical modelling, it is demonstrated that the observed velocity
perturbations can be understood in terms of coupling of different wave modes in
the inhomogeneous boundaries of the loops. Mode coupling in the inhomogeneous
boundary layers of the loops leads to the coupling of the transversal (kink)
mode to the azimuthal (Alfven) mode, observed as the decay of the transverse
kink oscillations. Both the numerical and analytical results show the spatial
profile of the damped wave has a Gaussian shape to begin with, before switching
to exponential decay at large heights. In addition, recent analysis of CoMP
(Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter) Doppler shift observations of large, off-
limb, trans-equatorial loops shows that Fourier power at the apex appears to be
higher in the high-frequency part of the spectrum than expected from
theoretical models. This excess high-frequency FFT power could be tentative
evidence for the onset of a cascade of the low-to-mid frequency waves into

by ion flows in presheaths and, when present, these instabilities can influence

The stability phase-space is characterized using the Penrose criterion and

instability-enhanced ion-ion friction force, are also briefly reviewed. Recent

trajectories. The current transition is to an unknown trajectory. There was
never any form of dramatic transition from stagnation to growth, described
often as a takeoff, because there was no stagnation in the growth of the world

GRB141121A, al- most ten years after its launch. Our observations covers radio
through X-rays, and extends for more than 30 days after discovery. The prompt
phase of GRB 141121A lasted 1410 s and, at the derived redshift of z = 1.469,
the isotropic energy is E{\gamma},iso = 8.0x10^52 erg. Due to the long prompt
duration, GRB141121A falls into the recently discovered class of UL-GRBs.
Peculiar features of this burst are a flat early-time optical light curve and a
radio-to-X-ray rebrightening around 3 days after the burst. The latter is
followed by a steep optical-to-X-ray decay and a much shallower radio fading.
We analyze GRB 141121A in the context of the standard forward-reverse shock
(FS,RS) scenario and we disentangle the FS and RS contributions. Finally, we
comment on the puzzling early-time (t ~3 d) behavior of GRB 141121A, and
suggest that its interpretation may require a two-component jet model. Overall,
our analysis confirms that the class of UL-GRBs represents our best opportunity
to firmly establish the prominent emission mechanisms in action during powerful
GRB explosions, and future missions (like SVOM, XTiDE, or ISS-Lobster) will
provide many more of such objects.

rarely reported in previous ground-based observations. Following the ergodic
hypothesis, we investigate in detail statistical properties of flare parameters
over a range of energy ($E_{r}$ $\simeq$ $10^{31}-10^{34}$ erg). As expected,
there are no statistical differences in the distributions of flare timescales,
energies, and frequencies among stars of the same age and mass group. We note
that our sample tend to have longer rise and decay timescales compared to those
seen in field flare stars of the same spectral type and be more energetic.

model. However, isotropy violations were reported in CMB temperature maps of
both WMAP and Planck data. We investigate the influence of different masks
employed in the analysis of CMB angular distribution, in particular in the
excess of power in the Southeastern quadrant (SEQ) and the lack of power in the
Northeastern quadrant (NEQ). We compare the two-point correlation function
(TPCF) computed for each quadrant of the CMB foreground-cleaned temperature
maps to 1000 simulations generated assuming the LCDM best-fit power spectrum
using four different masks. In addition to the quadrants, we computed the TPCF
for circular regions in the map where the excess and lack of power are present.
We also compare the effect of Galactic cuts in the TPCF calculations as
compared to the simulations. We found consistent results for three masks,
namely mask-rulerminimal, U73 and U66. The results indicate that the excess of
power in the SEQ tends to vanish as the portion of the sky covered by the mask
increases and the lack of power in the NEQ remains virtually unchanged. When
UT78 mask is applied, the NEQ becomes no longer anomalous and the excess of
power in the SEQ becomes the most significant one among the masks.
Nevertheless, the asymmetry between the SEQ and NEQ is independent of the mask
and it is in disagreement with the isotropic model with at least 95% C.L. We
find that UT78 is in disagreement with the other analysed masks, specially
considering the SEQ and the NEQ individual analysis. Most importantly, the use
of UT78 washes out the anomaly in the NEQ. Furthermore, we found excess of
kurtosis, compared with simulations, in the NEQ for the regions not masked by
UT78 but masked by the other masks, indicating that the previous result could
be due to non-removed residual foregrounds by UT78.

consisting of light quarks, such as the proton, emerges from the QCD Lagrangian
even in the limit of zero quark mass. If one requires the effective action
which underlies the QCD Lagrangian to remain conformally invariant and extends
the formalism of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to light-front Hamiltonian
theory, then a unique, color-confining potential with a mass parameter $\kappa$
emerges. The actual value of the parameter $\kappa$ is not set by the model -
only ratios of hadron masses and other hadronic mass scales are predicted. The
result is a nonperturbative, relativistic light-front quantum mechanical wave
equation, the Light-Front Schr\""odinger Equation which incorporates color
confinement and other essential spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron
physics, including a massless pion for zero quark mass and linear Regge
trajectories with the identical slope in the radial quantum number $n$ and
orbital angular momentum $L$. The same light-front equations for mesons with
spin $J$ also can be derived from the holographic mapping to QCD (3+1) at fixed
light-front time from the soft-wall model modification of AdS$_5$ space with a
specific dilaton profile. Light-front holography thus provides a precise
relation between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of AdS space
and the boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the internal
structure of hadrons in physical space-time. One can also extend the analysis
to baryons using superconformal algebra - $2 \times 2$ supersymmetric
representations of the conformal group. The resulting fermionic LF bound-state
equations predict striking similarities between the meson and baryon spectra.
In fact, the holographic QCD light-front Hamiltonians for the states on the

at the results of a non-sieving application of the Euler zeta function to the
prime shell function as well as to any integer-valued polynomial function in
general which has the ability to produce prime numbers when power $p$ is prime.
One familiar with the Euler zeta function, which established the remarkable
relationship between the prime and composite numbers, might naturally ponder
the results of the application of this special function in cases where there is
no known way to sieve composite numbers out of the product term in this famous
equation. Such would be case when an infinite series of numbers to be analyzed
are calculated by a polynomial expression that yields successively increasing
positive integer values and which has as its input domain the positive integers
themselves. In such cases there may not be an intuitive way to eliminate the
composite terms from the product term in the Euler zeta function equation by
either scaling a previous prime number calculation or by employing predictable
values of the domain of the function which would render outputs of the
polynomial prime. So the best one may be able to hope for in these cases is to
calculate some value to be added or subtracted from unity in the numerator
above the product term in the Euler Zeta function to make both sides of that
equation equal with the expectation that that value could be used to predict
the number of prime numbers that exist as outputs of the polynomial function
for some limit less than or equal to x of the input domain.

unresolved. We used forward-modelling to construct observational signatures
associated with a simple slow magneto-acoustic wave or periodic flow model.
Observational signatures were computed for the 171 {\AA} Fe ix and the 193
{\AA} Fe xii spectral lines. Although there are many differences between the
flow and wave models, we did not find any clear, robust observational
characteristics that can be used in isolation ( i.e. that do not rely on a
comparison between the models). For the waves model, a relatively rapid change
of the average line widths as a function of (shallow) line-of-sight angles was
found, whereas the ratio of the line width amplitudes to the Doppler velocity
amplitudes is relatively high for the flow model. The most robust observational
signature found is that the ratio of the mean to the amplitudes of the Doppler
velocity is always higher than one for the flow model. This ratio is
substantially higher for flows than for waves, and for the flows model used in
the study is exactly the same in the 171 {\AA} Fe ix and the 193 {\AA} Fe xii

treated cautiously because they are likely to be model-dependent.

successful to reproduce various empirical findings in social networks. However,
they have largely ignored the fact that individuals make decisions on whether
to create links to other individuals based on cost and benefit of linking, and
the fact that individuals may use perception of the network in their decision
making. In this paper, we study the evolution of social networks in terms of
perception-based strategic link formation. Here each individual has her own
perception of the actual network, and uses it to decide whether to create a
link to another individual. An individual with the least perception accuracy
can benefit from updating her perception using that of the most accurate
individual via a new link. This benefit is compared to the cost of linking in
decision making. Once a new link is created, it affects the accuracies of other
individuals' perceptions, leading to a further evolution of the actual network.
As for initial actual networks, we consider homogeneous and heterogeneous
cases. The homogeneous initial actual network is modeled by Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
(ER) random networks, while we take a star network for the heterogeneous case.
In any cases, individual perceptions of the actual network are modeled by ER
random networks with controllable linking probability. Then the stable link
density of the actual network is found to show discontinuous transitions or
jumps according to the cost of linking. As the number of jumps is the
consequence of the dynamical complexity, we discuss the effect of initial
conditions on the number of jumps to find that the dynamical complexity
strongly depends on how much individuals initially overestimate or
underestimate the link density of the actual network. For the heterogeneous
case, the role of the highly connected individual as an information spreader is
discussed.

measure associated with the random walk by transposition on $\mathfrak{S}(N)$.
This allows us to restrict our study to random walks on $\mathfrak{S}(N)$: we
prove theorems about asymptotics of random walks on $\mathfrak{S}(N)$ in a new
framework based on the geometric study of partitions and the Schur-Weyl-Jones's
dualities. In particular, given a sequence of conjugacy classes $(\lambda\_N

convergence for $(\lambda\_N)\_{N \in \mathbb{N}}$ which implies the
convergence in non-commutative distribution and in $\mathcal{P}$-expectation of
the $\lambda\_N$-random walk to a $\mathcal{P}$-free multiplicative L{\'e}vy
process. This limiting process is shown not to be a free multiplicative
L{\'e}vy process and we compute its log-cumulant functional. We give also a

The system is composed of two Neptune size planets close to the 3:2 mean-motion

observations of K2-19b and five additional radial velocity observations. These
were combined with K2 data and fitted simultaneously with the system dynamics
(photo-dynamical model) which increases the precision of the transit time
measurements. The higher transit time precision allows us to detect the
chopping signal of the dynamic interaction of the planets that in turn permits
to uniquely characterise the system. Although the reflex motion of the star was
not detected, dynamic modelling of the system allowed us to derive planetary
masses of $M_b= 44 \pm 12\, M_{\oplus}$ and $M_c = 15.9 \pm 7.0\, M_{\oplus}$

describes electron transport through a single barrier. Using the Fermi-Bose
equivalence in one dimension, we map the model onto a massless Thirring model
with a boundary interaction. A field theoretical perturbation theory for the
model has been developed and the chiral symmetry is found to play an important
role. The classical bulk action possesses a global $U_A(1)^4$ chiral symmetry,
since the fermion fields are massless. This global chiral symmetry is broken by
the boundary interaction and the bosonic degrees of freedom, corresponding to
the chiral phase transformation, become dynamical. They acquire an additional
kinetic action from the fermion path integral measure and govern the critical
behaviors of physical operators. On the critical line where the boundary
interaction becomes marginal, they decouple from the fermi fields. Consequently
the action reduces to the free field action, which contains only a fermion
bilinear boundary mass term as an interaction term. By a renormalization group
analysis, we obtain a new critical line, which differs from the previously
known critical lines in the literature. The result of this work implies that
the phase diagram of the one dimensional electron system may have a richer

reduce the population of mosquito vector, in order to maintain the proportion

so-called viability kernel is the set of initial states (mosquitoes and
infected individuals) for which such a fumigation control trajectory exists.

characterize so-called viable policies that produce, at each time, a fumigation

accuracy varies depending on the diminishing tail properties of the gradient of

the local convex properties of the loss and the proportion of the contaminated

boosting framework, {\it Arch Boost}, designed for augmenting the existing work
such that its corresponding classification algorithm is significantly more

framework, the non-convex losses lead to the new class of boosting algorithms,
named adaptive, robust, boosting (ARB). Furthermore, we present theoretical
examples that demonstrate the robustness properties of the proposed algorithms.
In particular, we develop a new breakdown point analysis and a new influence
function analysis that demonstrate gains in robustness. Moreover, we present
new theoretical results, based only on local curvatures, which may be used to
establish statistical and optimization properties of the proposed Arch boosting

routing table $\rho(r)$ to compute a neighbor $r'$ of $r$, a new header $h'$,
and the label $\ell(t')$ of an intermediate target $t'$. (The label of the
original target may be stored at the header $h'$.) The packet is then routed to
$r'$, and the procedure is repeated until the packet reaches $t$. The resulting

strongly favoring the view that the presence of CoFe2O4 does not induce the

cannot be attributed to some sort of proximity-induced magnetic moments at Pt
ions and subsequent magnetic-field dependent scattering. It thus follows that
either bulk (spin Hall and Inverse spin Hall Effects) or interface (Rashba)
spin-orbit related effects dominate the observed magnetoresistance.
Furthermore, comparison of bulk magnetization and XMCD data at (Fe,Co)-L2,3

may be relevant for the observed anomalous non-saturating field-dependence of

interfaces. In general the absorption in the typical studied materials can be
neglected and this technique is limited to the measurement of the reflectivity
only. In the case of strongly absorbing nuclei the number of neutrons is not
conserved and the absorption can be directly measured by using the
neutron-induced fluorescence technique which exploits the prompt particle
emission of absorbing isotopes. This technique is emerging from soft matter and
biology where highly absorbing nuclei, generally in very small quantities, are
used as a label for buried layers. Nowadays the importance of highly absorbing
layers is rapidly increasing, partially because of their application in neutron
detection; a field that has become more and more active also due to the
3He-shortage. In this manuscript we extend the neutron-induced fluorescence
technique to the study of thick layers of highly absorbing materials; in
particular 10B4C. The theory of neutron reflectometry is a commonly studied
topic, however the subtle relationship between the reflection and the
absorption of neutrons is not widely known, in particular when a strong
absorption is present. The theory for a general stack of absorbing layers has
been developed and compared to measurements. This new technique has potential
as a tool for characterization of highly absorbing layers. We also report on
the requirements that a 10B4C layer must fulfill in order to be employed as a

significant part of the online worldwide population~20% and has impressive
growth rates. The social graph of Twitter has been the subject of numerous
studies since it can reveal the intrinsic properties of large and complex
online communities. Despite the plethora of these studies, there is a limited
cover on the properties of the social graph while they evolve over time.
Moreover, due to the extreme size of this social network (millions of nodes,
billions of edges), there is a small subset of possible graph properties that
can be efficiently measured in a reasonable timescale. In this paper we propose
a sampling framework that allows the estimation of graph properties on large
social networks. We apply this framework to a subset of Twitter's social
network that has 13.2 million users, 8.3 billion edges and covers the complete
Twitter timeline (from April 2006 to January 2015). We derive estimation on the
time evolution of 24 graph properties many of which have never been measured on
large social networks. We further discuss how these estimations shed more light
on the inner structure and growth dynamics of Twitter's social network.

type IX universe and show that when the anisotropic pressures are stiffer on
average than any isotropic ultra-stiff fluid then, if they dominate on approach
to the singularity, it will be anisotropic. We include an isotropic ultra-stiff
ghost fluid with negative energy density in order to create a cosmological
bounce at finite volume in the absence of the anisotropic fluid. When the
dominant anisotropic fluid is present it leads to an anisotropic cosmological
singularity rather than an isotropic bounce. The inclusion of anisotropic

my DTI study. These tracts linked hippocampus to septum, and amygdala to BNST.
Septal and BNST axons passed by anteromedial thalamic nucleus to MHb, which
projected to pineal gland. Question is what is the MHb doing and why it
receives information from hippocampus via septum? This study explores the MHb
connectivity, predicts its functional role and how it is linked to memory.
Combination of known findings about the septum and MHb connectivity and
function led to this circuit-based idea that posterior septum activates MHb,
MHb activates IPN,and IPN stimulates MRN and its serotonin release. Proposed
idea is that this MHb-IPN-MRN circuit promotes slow wave sleep (SWS), high
serotonin and low acetylcholine state. My prediction is that this SWS-promoting
circuit reciprocally suppresses the theta oscillations promoting circuit,
linked to high acetylcholine levels in brain, and formed by supramamillary area
projections to the medial septum (MS) that induces theta rhythm in hippocampus
and other theta-coupled regions. The MHb-IPN-MRN pathway likely inhibits,
possibly reciprocally,some regions that have stimulating input to the
theta-generating SUM and MS, such as the wake promoting nucleus incertus,
posterior and lateral hypothalamus and LDT, but also the REM sleep inducing
neurons in LDT and PnO. Thus, proposed SWS- promoting circuit attenuates the
output of theta-promoting regions, both the active wake-on and REM-on regions.
The theta rhythm in wake state is linked to recording and binding information
with their spatio-temporal and relational context by hippocampus, while the SWS
supports rest and replay of hippocampaly stored information and their cortical
reactivations, e. g. in retrosplenial cortex linked to autobiographic memory or
in prefrontal cortex that can combine information from any source.

the carrier phase which allows for momentum exchange among both phases and to

radius ratio of the TC setup is fixed to $\eta=0.833$, and a maximum inner
cylinder Reynolds number of $Re_i=8000$ is reached. We vary the Froude number
($Fr$), which is the ratio of the centripetal to the gravitational acceleration
of the dispersed phase and study its effect on the net torque required to drive
the TC system. For the two-phase TC system, we observe drag reduction, i.e.,
the torque required to drive the inner cylinder is less compared to that of the
single phase system. The net drag reduction decreases with increasing Reynolds
number $Re_i$, which is consistent with previous experimental findings (Murai
et al. 2005, 2008). The drag reduction is strongly related to the Froude
number: for fixed Reynolds number we observe higher drag reduction when $Fr <
1$ than for with$ Fr > 1$. This buoyancy effect is more prominent in low $Re_i$
systems and decreases with increasing Reynolds number $Re_i$. We trace the drag
reduction back to the weakening of the angular momentum carrying Taylor rolls
by the rising bubbles.

jets caused by the velocity jumps near the jet surface. We derive a dispersion
equation with appropriate boundary condition for total pressure (including
centrifugal force of tube rotation), which governs the dynamics of
incompressible jets. Then, we obtain analytical instability criteria of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in various cases, which were verified by numerical
solutions to the dispersion equation. We find that twisted and rotating jets
are unstable to KH instability when the kinetic energy of rotation is more than
the magnetic energy of the twist. Our analysis shows that the azimuthal
magnetic field of 1-5 G can stabilize observed rotations in
spicule/macrospicules and X-ray/EUV jets. On the other hand, non-twisted jets
are always unstable to KH instability. In this case, the instability growth
time is several seconds for spicule/macrospicules and few minutes (or less) for
EUV/X-ray jets. We also find that standing kink and torsional Alfven waves are
always unstable near the antinodes due to the jump of azimuthal velocity at the
surface, while the propagating waves are generally stable. KH vortices may lead
to enhanced turbulence development and heating of surrounding plasma, therefore
rotating jets may provide energy for chromospheric and coronal heating.

photometry and spectroscopy for SN 2012ca, covering the period from 6~days
prior to maximum light, until 531 days after maximum. The spectroscopic time
series for SN 2012ca is essentially unchanged over 1.5 years, and appear to be
dominated at all epochs by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar
medium rather than the underlying supernova (SN). At late phases, we see a near
infrared excess in flux which is possibly associated with dust formation,
although without any signs of accompanying line shifts. SN 2012ca is a member
of the set of type of the ambiguous IIn/Ia-CSM SNe, the nature of which have
been debated extensively in the literature. The two leading scenarios are
either a type Ia SN exploding within a dense CSM from a non-degenerate, evolved
companion, or a core-collapse SN from a massive star. While some members of the
population have been unequivocally associated with type Ia SNe, in other cases
the association is less certain. While it is possible that SN 2012ca does arise
from a thermonuclear SN, this would require a relatively high (between 20 and
70 per cent) efficiency in converting kinetic energy to optical luminosity, and
a massive (~2.3-2.6 Msun) circumstellar medium. On the basis of energetics, and
the results of simple modelling, we suggest that SN 2012ca is more likely
associated with a core-collapse SN. This would imply that the observed set of
similar SNe to SN 2012ca is in fact originated by two populations, and while
these are drawn from physically distinct channels, they can have
observationally similar properties.

observed in the X-ray power spectra (PSDs) of stellar mass X-ray binaries

present in the active galactic nuclei. The first robust detection was a $\sim
1$ hr periodicity in the Seyfert galaxy RE J1034+396 from a $\sim 90$ ks
XMM-Newton observation, however, subsequent observations failed to detect the
QPO in the $0.3-10.0$ keV band. In this talk we present the recent detection of
the $\sim 1$ hr periodicity in the $1.0-4.0$ keV band of 4 further
low-flux/spectrally-harder observations of RE J1034+396 (see Alston et al

with the primary power-law continuum emission (Alston et al 2015). We conclude
these features are most likely analogous to the high-frequency QPOs observed in
XRBs. In both sources, we also see evidence for X-ray reverberation at the QPO
frequency, where soft X-ray bands and Iron K$\alpha$ emission lag the primary
X-ray continuum. These time delays may provide another diagnostic for
understanding the underlying QPO mechanism observed in accreting black holes.

H2 physical adsorption since they provide larger binding energies at

graphtriyne a flat minimum located right in the geometric center of the pore is
identified. A novel graphite composed of graphtriyne stacked sheets is then
proposed and an estimation of its 3D arrangement is obtained at the DFT level
of theory. In contrast to pristine graphite this new carbon material allow both
H2 intercalation and out-of-plane diffusion by exploiting the larger volume
provided by its nanopores. Related H2 binding energies for intercalation and
in-pore adsorption are around 0.1 eV and they could lead to high storage

them into disturbed and undisturbed. We also visually identify mergers.
Additionally, we provide a quantitative measure of the degree of disturbance
for each galaxy (""roughness""). The majority of elliptical and lenticular
galaxies have relaxed structure, showing no signs of ongoing star formation.
Structurally-disturbed galaxies, which tend to avoid the lowest-density
regions, have higher star-formation activity and younger stellar populations
than undisturbed systems. Cluster spirals with reduced/quenched star formation
have somewhat less disturbed morphologies than spirals with ""normal""
star-formation activity, suggesting that these ""passive"" spirals have started
their morphological transformation into S0s. Visually identified mergers and
galaxies not identified as mergers but with similar roughness have similar
specific star formation rates and stellar ages. The degree of enhanced star
formation is thus linked to the degree of structural disturbance, regardless of
whether it is caused by major mergers or not. This suggests that merging
galaxies are not special in terms of their higher-than-normal star-formation
activity. Any physical process that produces ""roughness"", or regions of
enhanced luminosity density, will increase the star-formation activity in a
galaxy with similar efficiency. An alternative explanation is that star
formation episodes increase the galaxies' roughness similarly, regardless of
whether they are merger-induced or not.

variational principle 'generically' admit linear surface waves, as was shown by
Serre [J. Funct. Anal. 2006]. At the weakly nonlinear level, the behavior of
surface waves is expected to be governed by an amplitude equation that can be
derived by means of a formal asymptotic expansion. Amplitude equations for
weakly nonlinear surface waves were introduced by Lardner [Int. J. Engng Sci.
1983], Parker and co-workers [J. Elasticity 1985] in the framework of
elasticity, and by Hunter [Contemp. Math. 1989] for abstract hyperbolic
problems. They consist of nonlocal evolution equations involving a complicated,
bilinear Fourier multiplier in the direction of propagation along the boundary.
It was shown by the authors in an earlier work [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2012]
that this multiplier, or kernel, inherits some algebraic properties from the
original IBVP. These properties are crucial for the (local) well-posedness of
the amplitude equation, as shown together with Tzvetkov [Adv. Math., 2011].
Properties of amplitude equations are revisited here in a somehow simpler way,
for surface waves in a variational setting. Applications include various
physical models, from elasticity of course to the director-field system for
liquid crystals introduced by Saxton [Contemp. Math. 1989] and studied by
Austria and Hunter [Commun. Inf. Syst. 2013]. Similar properties are eventually
shown for the amplitude equation associated with surface waves at reversible
phase boundaries in compressible fluids, thus completing a work initiated by
Benzoni-Gavage and Rosini [Comput. Math. Appl. 2009].

popular approach are ray-mapping methods, where first a ray mapping between the

The challenging part hereby is the to find an integrable mapping ensuring a
continuous surface. Based on the law of reflection/refraction and the
well-known integrability condition, we derive a general condition for the
surface and ray mapping for a collimated input beam. It is shown that in a
small-angle approximation a proper mapping can be calculated via optimal mass
transport. We show that the surface can be constructed by solving a linear
advection equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The results imply that
the optimal mass transport mapping is approximately integrable over a wide
range of distances between the freeform and the target plane and offer an
efficient way to construct the surface by solving standard integrals. The
efficiency is demonstrated by applying it to two challenging design examples.

high Rotation Measure (RM). These point-like objects show a strong
depolarisation at 21cm. This feature suggests the presence of a very dense
medium surrounding them in a combination of a strong magnetic field. This work
aims at selecting and studying a sample of radio sources with high RM, thus to
study their physical conditions and their status with respect to their
surrounding medium. We want to understand if any connection is present between
the AGN hosting galaxy medium with some evolutionary track and/or some
restarting phase of the AGN itself. Multifrequency single-dish observations
were performed with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope to define the initial
sample, to characterise the SED of the final sample (30 targets) and to
determine their RM in the 11 to 2 cm wavelength range. From the observations,
the SED together with polarisation information, i.e. the fractional
polarisation and the polarisation angle, have been determined. Three different
object types were revealed from the SEDs analysis: Older, GPS-like and Mixed.
For each of the targets, the rotation measure has been found and the
depolarisation has been modelled. No significant correlation have been found
between the depolarisation behaviours and the SEDs, while a correlation has
been found between sources with mixed SED (with an old component at low
frequency and compact components at high frequencies) and high values of the
rotation measure (with values in the rest frame larger than 1000 rad/m^2). This
work helps us to define and identify a sample of sources with high RM. From the
analysis we can conclude that the sources showing a restarting phase at high
frequency (with a Mixed SED), are characterised by a really dense and/or a
magnetised medium that strongly rotates the polarisation angle at the different
frequencies, leading to a high RM.

  Roscoff (France)",,"10.1051/eas/1573003",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A leap forward has been performed due to the space-borne missions, MOST,
CoRoT and Kepler. They provided a wealth of observational data, and more
precisely oscillation spectra, which have been (and are still) exploited to
infer the internal structure of stars. While an adiabatic approach is often
sufficient to get information on the stellar equilibrium structures it is not
sufficient to get a full understanding of the physics of the oscillation.
Indeed, it does not permit one to answer some fundamental questions about the
oscillations, such as: What are the physical mechanisms responsible for the
pulsations inside stars? What determines the amplitudes? To what extent the
adiabatic approximation is valid? All these questions can only be addressed by
considering the energy exchanges between the oscillations and the surrounding
medium.
  This lecture therefore aims at considering the energetical aspects of stellar
pulsations with particular emphasis on the driving and damping mechanisms. To
this end, the full non-adiabatic equations are introduced and thoroughly
discussed. Two types of pulsation are distinguished, namely the self-excited
oscillations that result from an instability and the solar-like oscillations
that result from a balance between driving and damping by turbulent convection.
For each type, the main physical principles are presented and illustrated using
recent observations obtained with the ultra-high precision photometry
space-borne missions (MOST, CoRoT and Kepler). Finally, we consider in detail
the physics of scaling relations, which relates the seismic global indices with
the global stellar parameters and gave birth to the development of statistical
(or ensemble) asteroseismology. Indeed, several of these relations rely on the
same cause: the physics of non-adiabatic oscillations.

typical urban journey requirements. Along this line, we present methods dealing
with the so-called asymmetric demand-offer problem (i.e. the unbalanced offer

severely affects their economic viability as it implies that considerable human
(and financial) resources should be engaged in relocating vehicles to satisfy
customer demand. The chapter covers all planning aspects that affect the
effectiveness and viability of vehicle sharing systems: the actual system
design (e.g. number and location of vehicle station facilities, vehicle fleet
size, vehicles distribution among stations); customer incentivisation schemes
to motivate customer-based distribution of bicycles/cars (such schemes offer
meaningful incentives to users so as to leave their vehicle to a station
different to that originally intended and satisfy future user demand);
cost-effective solutions to schedule operator-based repositioning of
bicycles/cars (by employees explicitly enrolled in vehicle relocation) based on
the current and future (predicted) demand patterns (operator-based and
customer-based relocation may be thought as complementary methods to achieve
the intended distribution of vehicles among stations).

Chebyshev polynomial expansion technique, we study the two-hole excitation
spectrum of the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the entire filling range from
the completely occupied band (n=2) down to half-filling (n=1). For strong
interactions, the spectra reveal multiplon physics, i.e., relevant final states
are characterized by two (doublon), three (triplon), four (quadruplon) and more
holes, potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite
lifetime. These give rise to several satellites in the spectra with largely
different spectral weights as well as to different continua. The complex
multiplon phenomenology is analyzed by interpreting not only local and
k-resolved two-hole spectra but also three- and four-hole spectra for the
Hubbard model and by referring to effective low-energy models. In addition, a
filter-operator technique is presented which allows to extract specific
information on the final states at a given excitation energy. While multiplons
composed of an odd number of holes do neither form stable compounds nor
well-defined resonances unless a nearest-neighbor density interaction V is
added to the Hamiltonian, the doublon and the quadruplon are well-defined
resonances. The k-resolved four-hole spectrum at n=2 represents an interesting
special case where a completely stable quadruplon turns into a resonance by
merging with the doublon-doublon continuum at a critical wave vector. For all
fillings with n > 1, the doublon lifetime is strongly k-dependent and is even
infinite at the Brillouin zone edges as demonstrated by k-resolved two-hole
spectra. This can be traced back to the ""hidden"" charge-SU(2) symmetry of the
model which is explicitly broken off half-filling and gives rise to a massive
collective excitation, even for arbitrary higher-dimensional but bipartite
lattices.

separating the contribution of the QNM and the bulk material, we give

orders of magnitude improvements over direct dipole simulations that

option prices are derived. Furthermore, through adopting data on daily VIX
future and option prices, we investigate our model along with the Heston model

illustrates that the 4/2 model with an instantaneous volatility of the form
$(a\sqrt{V_t}+b/\sqrt{V_t})$ for some constants $a, b$ presents considerable
advantages in pricing VIX derivatives.

the example of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) hierarchy. For each integrable
nonlinear evolution equation (NLEE) in the hierarchy, dual integrable
structures are characterized by the fact that the zero-curvature representation
of the NLEE can be realized by two Hamiltonian formulations stemming from two
distinct choices of the configuration space, yielding two inequivalent Poisson
structures on the corresponding phase space and two distinct Hamiltonians. This
is fundamentally different from the standard bi-Hamiltonian or generally
multitime structure. The first formulation chooses purely space-dependent
fields as configuration space; it yields the standard Poisson structure for
NLS. The other one is new: it chooses purely time-dependent fields as
configuration space and yields a different Poisson structure at each level of
the hierarchy. The corresponding NLEE becomes a {\it space} evolution equation.
We emphasize the role of the Lagrangian formulation as a unifying framework for
deriving both Poisson structures, using ideas from covariant field theory. One
of our main results is to show that the two matrices of the Lax pair satisfy
the same form of ultralocal Poisson algebra (up to a sign) characterized by an
$r$-matrix structure, whereas traditionally only one of them is involved in the
classical $r$-matrix method. We construct explicit dual hierarchies of
Hamiltonians, and Lax representations of the triggered dynamics, from the
monodromy matrices of either Lax matrix. An appealing procedure to build a
multi-dimensional lattice of Lax pair, through successive uses of the dual
Poisson structures, is briefly introduced.

multiple velocity components. The Fe XXV line is found to be shaped by
contributions from the intercombination line (in absorption), and the Fe XXVI

zones, depending on the source. The fastest components have velocities
approaching or exceeding 0.01c, increasing mass outflow rates and wind kinetic
power by orders of magnitude over prior single-zone models. The first-order
spectra require re-emission from the wind, broadened by a degree that is
loosely consistent with Keplerian orbital velocities at the photoionization
radius. This suggests that disk winds are rotating with the orbital velocity of
the underlying disk, and provides a new means of estimating launching radii --
crucial to understanding wind driving mechanisms. Some aspects of the wind
velocities and radii correspond well to the broad-line region (BLR) in active

influences the spectral energy distribution (SED) of stars. An uneven surface
  distribution of these elements, together with flux redistribution and stellar
rotation, are commonly believed to be the primary causes of the
  variability of chemically peculiar (CP) stars.
  Aims: We aim to model the photometric variability of the CP star PHI Dra
based on the assumption of inhomogeneous surface distribution of heavier
  elements and compare it to the observed variability of the star. We also
intend to identify the processes that contribute most significantly
  to its photometric variability.
  Methods: We use a grid of TLUSTY model atmospheres and the SYNSPEC code to
model the radiative flux emerging from the individual surface elements of PHI
Dra
  with different chemical compositions. We integrate the emerging flux over the
visible surface of the star at different phases throughout the entire
  rotational period to synthesise theoretical light curves of the star in
several spectral bands.
  Results: The synthetic light curves in the visible and in the near-UV regions
are in very good agreement with the observed variability of the star.
  The lack of usable far-UV measurements of the star precludes making any
conclusions about the correctness of our model in this spectral region. We
  also obtained 194 new BVRI observations of PHI Dra and improved its
rotational period to P=1.716500(2).
  Conclusions: We show that the inhomogeneous distribution of elements, flux
redistribution, and rotation of the star are fully capable of explaining the
stellar
  variability in the visible and the near-UV regions. The flux redistribution
is mainly caused by bound--free transitions of silicon and bound--bound
  transitions of iron.

coherence of a quantum sensor or qubit. For solid state spin qubits such as the
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, a dominant source of environmental
noise is magnetic field fluctuations due to nearby paramagnetic impurities and
instabilities in a magnetic bias field. In this work, we use ac stress
generated by a diamond mechanical resonator to engineer a dressed spin basis in
which a single NV center qubit is less sensitive to its magnetic environment.
For a qubit in the thermally isolated subspace of this protected basis, we
prolong the dephasing time $T_2^*$ from $2.7\pm0.1$ $\mu$s to $15\pm1$ $\mu$s
by dressing with a $\Omega=581\pm2$ kHz mechanical Rabi field. Furthermore, we
develop a model that quantitatively predicts the relationship between $\Omega$
and $T_2^*$ in the dressed basis. Our model suggests that a combination of
magnetic field fluctuations and hyperfine coupling to nearby nuclear spins
limits the protected coherence time over the range of $\Omega$ accessed here.
We show that amplitude noise in $\Omega$ will dominate the dephasing for larger
driving fields.

capacity to assess time irreversibility. Non-stationary signals are
(infinitely) irreversible by definition (independently of whether the process
is Markovian or producing entropy at a positive rate), and thus the link
between entropy production and time series irreversibility has only been
explored in non-equilibrium stationary states. Here we show that the visibility
formalism naturally induces a new working definition of time irreversibility,
which allows to quantify several degrees of irreversibility for stationary and
non-stationary series, yielding finite values that can be used to efficiently
assess the presence of memory and off-equilibrium dynamics in non-stationary
processes without needs to differentiate or detrend them. We provide rigorous
results complemented by extensive numerical simulations on several classes of

nor of an increase (beyond inflation) in the average requested funding per

as well as recent research on the time cost of proposal writing versus that of
producing publishable results. We conclude that an aspirational proposal
success rate of 30-35% would still provide a healthily competitive environment

semi-infinite crack in an isotropic solid comprising an infinite strip and a
half-plane joined together and having the same elastic constants. The crack
propagates along the interface at constant speed subject to time-independent
loading. By means of the Laplace and Fourier transforms the problem is
formulated as a vector Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the distance from the
crack to the boundary grows to infinity the problem admits a closed-form
solution. In the general case, a method of partial matrix factorization is
proposed. In addition to factorizing some scalar functions it requires solving
a certain system of integral equations whose numerical solution is computed by
the collocation method. The stress intensity factors and the associated weight
functions are derived. Numerical results for the weight functions are reported
and the boundary effects are discussed. The weight functions are employed to
describe propagation of a semi-infinite crack beneath the half-plane boundary
