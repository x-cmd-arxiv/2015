us to control the quality of layered structures? In this paper we numerically
model the dynamics of a long longitudinal strain solitary wave in a split,

matching two asymptotic multiple-scales expansions and the integrability theory

also employ a direct finite-difference method and compare the numerical results

confirms that delamination causes fission of an incident solitary wave and,
thus, can be used to detect the defect.

structure such as black phosphorus and monochalcogenide monolayers are an
exciting and novel material platform for a host of applications. Key to their
crystallinity, monolayers of these materials have a four-fold degenerate
structural ground state, and a single energy scale $E_C$ (representing the
elastic energy required to switch the longer lattice vector along the $x-$ or
$y-$direction) determines how disordered these monolayers are at finite
temperature. Disorder arises when nearest neighboring atoms become gently
reassigned as the system is thermally excited beyond a critical temperature
$T_c$ that is proportional to $E_C/k_B$. $E_C$ is tunable by chemical
composition and it leads to a classification of these materials into two
categories: (i) Those for which $E_C\ge k_BT_m$, and (ii) those having
$k_BT_m>E_C\ge 0$, where $T_m$ is a given material's melting temperature. Black
phosphorus and SiS monolayers belong to category (i): these materials do not
display an intermediate order-disorder transition and melt directly. All other
monochalcogenide monolayers with $E_C>0$ belonging to class (ii) will undergo a
two-dimensional transition prior to melting. $E_C/k_B$ is slightly larger than
room temperature for GeS and GeSe, and smaller than 300 K for SnS and SnSe
monolayers, so that these materials transition near room temperature. The onset
of this generic atomistic phenomena is captured by a planar Potts model up to
the order-disorder transition. The order-disorder phase transition in two
dimensions described here is at the origin of the {\em Cmcm} phase being

truly streaming, distributed, asynchronous, learning-rate-free, and
truncation-free. The key challenge in developing the framework, arising from
the fact that BNP models do not impose an inherent ordering on their
components, is finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP
posterior components before performing each update. To address this, the paper
develops a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences,
and provides an efficient solution technique. The paper concludes with an
application of the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental
results demonstrating its practical scalability and performance.

been shown to be a powerful tool to predict various thermodynamic properties of
hard-sphere systems. We employ this approach to determine not only one-particle
densities but also two-particle correlations in binary and six-component
mixtures of hard spheres in the vicinity of a hard wall. The broken isotropy
enables us to carefully test a large variety of theoretically predicted
two-particle features by quantitatively comparing them to the results of
Brownian dynamics simulations. Specifically, we determine and compare the
one-particle density, the total correlation functions, their contact values,
and the force distributions acting on a particle. For this purpose, we follow
the compressibility route and theoretically calculate the direct correlation
functions by taking functional derivatives. We usually observe an excellent
agreement between theory and simulations, except for small deviations in cases
where local crystal-like order sets in. Our results set the course for further
investigations on the consistency of functionals as well as for structural
analysis on, e.g., the primitive model. In addition, we demonstrate that due to
the suppression of local crystallization, the predictions of six-component
mixtures are better than those in bidisperse or monodisperse systems. Finally,
we are confident that our results of the structural modulations induced by the
wall lead to a deeper understanding of ordering in anisotropic systems in

dynamics close to a wall, as well as structural properties in systems with

used for state manipulation to Local Operations assisted by Classical
Communication (LOCC). Hence, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state
which can be transformed deterministically into any other state via LOCC. In
the multipartite setting no such state exists. There, rather a whole set, the
Maximally Entangled Set of states (MES), which we recently introduced, is
required. This set has on the one hand the property that any state outside of
this set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states within the set and on
the other hand, no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via
LOCC. Recently, we studied LOCC transformations among pure multipartite states
and derived the MES for 3- and generic 4-qubit states. Here, we consider the
non-generic 4-qubit states and analyze their properties regarding local
transformations. We prove that most SLOCC classes show a similar behavior as
the generic states, however we also identify three classes with very distinct
properties. The first consists of the GHZ and W class, where any state can be
transformed into some other state non-trivially. In particular, there exists no
isolation. On the other hand, there also exist classes where all states are
isolated. Last but not least we identify an additional class of states, whose
transformation properties differ drastically from all the other classes. Our
investigations do not only identify the most relevant classes of states for
LOCC entanglement manipulation, but also reveal new insight into the
similarities and differences between separable and LOCC transformations and
enable the investigation of LOCC transformations among arbitrary four qubit

data from the free proton target are in good agreement with previous
measurements and were only used to test the analysis procedures. The results
for differential cross sections (angular distributions and invariant-mass
distributions) for free and quasi-free protons are almost identical in shape,
but differ in absolute magnitude up to 15\%. Thus, moderate final-state
interaction effects are present. The data for quasi-free neutrons are similar
to the proton data in the second resonance region (final state invariant masses
up to $\approx$1550~MeV), where both reactions are dominated by the
$N(1520)3/2^-\rightarrow \Delta(1232)3/2^+\pi$ decay. At higher energies,
angular and invariant-mass distributions are different. A simple analysis of
the shapes of the invariant-mass distributions in the third resonance region is
consistent with strong contributions of an $N^{\star}\rightarrow N\sigma$ decay

an electric potential and a local distortion of the superconducting gap. A set
of equations for the quasiclassical Green functions is derived and solved.
Within one spin sector, pairing-potential impurities and weak spin-polarized
magnetic impurities have essentially the same effect on the density of states.
We show that if the gap is isotropic, an isolated impurity with suppressed
pairing supports an infinite number of Andreev states. With growing impurity
concentration, the energy-dependent density of states evolves from a sharp gap
edge with an impurity band below it to a smeared BCS singularity in the
so-called universal limit. If a gap anisotropy is present, the density of
states becomes sensitive to ordinary potential disorder, and the existence of
of Andreev states localized at pairing-potential impurities requires special
conditions. An unusual feature related to the anisotropy is a nonmonotonic
dependence of the gap edge smearing on impurity concentration.

ideal target since it hosts an H II region association. Column density and
temperature images derived from Herschel data were used together to model the
structure of HII bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. The resulting
observational constraints were used to follow the development of the Mon R2
ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. The
four hot bubbles associated with H II regions are surrounded by dense, cold,
and neutral gas envelopes. The radial density profiles are reminiscent of those
of low-mass protostellar envelopes. The inner parts of envelopes of all four
HII regions could be free-falling because they display shallow density
profiles. As for their outer parts, the two compact HII regions show a density
profile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.
In contrast, the central UCHii region shows a steeper outer profile, that could
be interpreted as material being forced to collapse. The size of the heated
bubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initial
neutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,
0.1Myr,for the dense UCHII and compact HII regions and 0.35 Myr for the

aperture photometry. Because of Kepler's large, undersampled pixels and the
presence of nearby sources, aperture photometry is not always the ideal way to
obtain high-precision photometry and, because of this, the data set has not
been fully exploited so far. We present a new method that builds on our
experience with undersampled HST images. The method involves a point-spread
function (PSF) neighbour-subtraction and was specifically developed to exploit
the huge potential offered by the K2 ""super-stamps"" covering the core of dense
star clusters. Our test-bed targets were the NGC 2158 and M 35 regions observed
during the K2 Campaign 0. We present our PSF modeling and demonstrate that, by
using a high-angular-resolution input star list from the Asiago Schmidt
telescope as the basis for PSF neighbour subtraction, we are able to reach
magnitudes as faint as Kp~24 with a photometric precision of 10% over 6.5
hours, even in the densest regions. At the bright end, our photometric
precision reaches ~30 parts-per-million. Our method leads to a considerable
level of improvement at the faint magnitudes (Kp>15.5) with respect to the
classical aperture photometry. This improvement is more significant in crowded
regions. We also extracted raw light curves of ~60,000 stars and detrended them
for systematic effects induced by spacecraft motion and other artifacts that
harms K2 photometric precision. We present a list of 2133 variables.

""geometric ferroelectricity"" in these materials is driven by the softening of a
single polar phonon mode consisting of rotations of the MF$_6$ octahedra
accompanied by polar displacements of the Ba cations, and in contrast to
conventional ferroelectrics involves minimal electronic rehybridization. We
therefore anticipate a different strain dependence of the polarization, and
alternative domain wall structures compared with those found in conventional
ferroelectric materials. Using first-principles calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) within the general gradient approximation (GGA), we
calculate the variation of the crystal structure and the ferroelectric
polarization under both compressive and tensile strain. We perform structural
relaxations of neutral domain walls between oppositely oriented directions of
the ferroelectric polarization and calculate their corresponding energies to
determine which are most likely to form. We compare our results to literature
values for conventional perovskite oxides to provide a source of comparison for
understanding the ferroelectric properties of alternative non-oxide materials

by tuning the frequency of a spatial modulation through the inhomogeneously
broadened vibrational absorption spectrum. We show that due to the presence of
multiple crossings, the population transfer depends on the direction of the
frequency sweep, in contrast to traditional ARP. In a second study, we control
these states by applying a pulse sequence involving both the displacement of
the optical lattice and modulation of the lattice depth. This pulse is
engineered via the GRAPE algorithm to maximize the number of atoms transferred
from the initial (ground) state to the first excited state. We find that the
ARP and the GRAPE techniques are superior to the previously tested techniques
at transferring population into the first excited state from the ground state:
$38.9\pm0.2\%$ and $39\pm2\%$ respectively. GRAPE outperforms ARP in leaving
the higher excited states unpopulated (less than $3.3\%$ of the ground state
population, at $84\%$ confidence level), while $18.7\pm0.3\%$ of the ground
state population is transferred into higher excited states by using ARP. On the

used in the sharp delineation of the computational phase transition that arises
in the approximation of the partition function of anti-ferromagnetic two-spin
models.
  Previous analyses of correlation-decay algorithms implicitly depended on the
occurrence of strong spatial mixing (SSM). This means that one uses worst-case
analysis of the recursive procedure that creates the sub-instances. We develop
a new analysis method that is more refined than the worst-case analysis. We
take the shape of instances in the computation tree into consideration and
amortise against certain ""bad"" instances that are created as the recursion
proceeds. This enables us to show correlation decay and to obtain an FPTAS even
when SSM fails.
  We apply our technique to the problem of approximately counting independent
sets in hypergraphs with degree upper-bound Delta and with a lower bound k on
the arity of hyperedges. Liu and Lin gave an FPTAS for k>=2 and Delta<=5 (lack
of SSM was the obstacle preventing this algorithm from being generalised to
Delta=6). Our technique gives a tight result for Delta=6, showing that there is
an FPTAS for k>=3 and Delta<=6. The best previously-known approximation scheme
for Delta=6 is the Markov-chain simulation based FPRAS of Bordewich, Dyer and
Karpinski, which only works for k>=8.
  Our technique also applies for larger values of k, giving an FPTAS for
k>=Delta. This bound is not substantially stronger than existing randomised
results in the literature. Nevertheless, it gives the first deterministic
approximation scheme in this regime. Moreover, unlike existing results, it
leads to an FPTAS for counting dominating sets in regular graphs with
sufficiently large degree.
  We further demonstrate that approximately counting independent sets in
hypergraphs is NP-hard even within the uniqueness regime.

noise present in the individual pulsar timing data. Noise may be either
intrinsic or extrinsic to the pulsar. Intrinsic sources of noise will include
rotational instabilities, for example. Extrinsic sources of noise include
contributions from physical processes which are not sufficiently well modelled,
for example, dispersion and scattering effects, analysis errors and
instrumental instabilities. We present the results from a noise analysis for 42
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed with the European Pulsar Timing Array. For
characterising the low-frequency, stochastic and achromatic noise component, or
""timing noise"", we employ two methods, based on Bayesian and frequentist
statistics. For 25 MSPs, we achieve statistically significant measurements of
their timing noise parameters and find that the two methods give consistent
results. For the remaining 17 MSPs, we place upper limits on the timing noise
amplitude at the 95% confidence level. We additionally place an upper limit on
the contribution to the pulsar noise budget from errors in the reference
terrestrial time standards (below 1%), and we find evidence for a noise
component which is present only in the data of one of the four used telescopes.
Finally, we estimate that the timing noise of individual pulsars reduces the
sensitivity of this data set to an isotropic, stochastic GW background by a
factor of >9.1 and by a factor of >2.3 for continuous GWs from resolvable,
inspiralling supermassive black-hole binaries with circular orbits.

  In the univariate case of degree $n$, Marco and Martinez showed that using
Neville elimination to solve the system exploits the total positivity of the

Remarkable as it may be, the Marco-Martinez algorithm has some drawbacks: The
derivation of the algorithm is quite technical; the interplay between the ideas
of total positivity and Neville elimination are not part of the standard
armoury of many non-specialists; and, the algorithm is strongly associated to
the univariate case.
  The present work addresses these issues. An alternative algorithm for the
inversion of the univariate Bernstein-Vandermonde system is presented that has:
The same complexity as the Marco-Martinez algorithm and whose stability does
not seem to be in any way inferior; a simple derivation using only the basic
theory of Lagrange interpolation (at least in the univariate case); and, a
natural generalisation to the multivariate case.

distinct structures and properties by nanosecond-duration applied electric
field pulses. Time-resolved synchrotron x-ray microdiffraction shows that the
steady-state transformation between phases is accompanied by a dynamical
component that is reversed upon the removal of the field. Steady-state
measurements reveal that approximately 20% of the volume of a BFO thin film
grown on a LaAlO3 substrate can be reproducibly transformed between
rhombohedral-like and tetragonal-like phases by electric field pulses with
magnitudes up to 2 MV/cm. A transient component, in which the transformation is
reversed following the end of the electric field pulse, can transform a similar
fraction of the BFO layer and occurs rapidly time scale limited by the charging
time constant of the thin film capacitor. The piezoelectric expansion of the
tetragonal-like phase leads to a strain of up to 0.1%, with a lower limit of 10
pm/V for the piezoelectric coefficient of this phase. Density functional theory
calculations provide insight into the mechanism of the phase transformation
showing that imparting a transient strain of this magnitude favors a
transformation from rhombohedral-like to tetragonal-like phase.

Q-Network (DQN), which decodes the output sequence iteratively. The aim here is
to enable the decoder to first tackle easier portions of the sequences, and
then turn to cope with difficult parts. Specifically, in each iteration, an
encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is employed to, from the
input sequence, automatically create features to represent the internal states
of and formulate a list of potential actions for the DQN. Take rephrasing a
natural sentence as an example. This list can contain ranked potential words.
Next, the DQN learns to make decision on which action (e.g., word) will be
selected from the list to modify the current decoded sequence. The newly
modified output sequence is subsequently used as the input to the DQN for the
next decoding iteration. In each iteration, we also bias the reinforcement
learning's attention to explore sequence portions which are previously
difficult to be decoded. For evaluation, the proposed strategy was trained to
decode ten thousands natural sentences. Our experiments indicate that, when
compared to a left-to-right greedy beam search LSTM decoder, the proposed
method performed competitively well when decoding sentences from the training
set, but significantly outperformed the baseline when decoding unseen
sentences, in terms of BLEU score obtained.

beyond Gaussian statistics for the initial conditions and investigate the
subsequent evolution of the two-point clustering of peaks through their

scale-dependencies induced by nonlinear gravitational evolution. While the
expected large-scale separation limit is recovered, significant deviations are

slit crossed a flare ribbon during the impulsive phase, when the helium line
intensities turned into emission at $<$ twice the continuum intensity. Their
linear polarization profiles are of the same sign across the multiplet
including 1082.9 nm, intensity-like, at $<5$\% of the continuum intensity.
Weaker Zeeman-induced linear polarization is also observed. Only the strongest
linear polarization coincides with hard X-ray (HXR) emission at 30-70 keV
observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager. The
polarization is generally more extended and lasts longer than the HXR emission.
The upper $J=0$ level of the 1082.9~nm component is unpolarizable, thus lower
level polarization is the culprit. We make non-LTE radiative transfer
calculations in thermal slabs optimized to fit only intensities. The linear
polarizations are naturally reproduced, through a systematic change of sign
with wavelength of the radiation anisotropy when slab optical depths of the
1082.9 component are $< 1$. Collisions with beams of particles are neither
needed nor can they produce the same sign of polarization of the 1082.9 and
1083.0 nm components. The He I line polarization merely requires heating
sufficient to produce slabs of the required thickness. Widely different
polarizations of H$\alpha$, reported previously, are explained by different
radiative anisotropies arising from slabs of different optical depths.

prototypical example for community detection, in which the community
corresponds to the support of the submatrix. The main result of this paper is
that in the regime $\Omega(\sqrt{n}) \leq K \leq o(n)$, the support of the
submatrix can be weakly recovered (with $o(K)$ misclassification errors on
average) by an optimized message passing algorithm if $\lambda = \mu^2K^2/n$,
the signal-to-noise ratio, exceeds $1/e$. This extends a result by Deshpande

algorithm can be extended to provide exact recovery whenever
information-theoretically possible and achieve the information limit of exact
recovery as long as $K \geq \frac{n}{\log n} (\frac{1}{8e} + o(1))$. The total
running time of the algorithm is $O(n^2\log n)$.
  Another version of the submatrix localization problem, known as noisy
biclustering, aims to recover a $K_1\times K_2$ submatrix of elevated mean

evaporation field of the surface atoms under high electric fields. We show how
the evaporation field of atoms is related to the charge density by comparing
the directionality and localization of the electrons with the evaporation of
single ions versus dimers. This evaporation mechanism is important for the
reconstruction of APT data, which is partially dependent on the input
evaporation fields of the atoms. In $L1_{2}-Al_{3}Sc$, $Al-Al$ surface atoms
are more likely to evaporate as dimers than $Al-Sc$ surface atoms. We find that
this is due to $Al-Al$ having a shared charge density, while $Al-Sc$ has an
increased density localized around the $Sc$ atom. Further, the role of
subsurface layers on the evaporation physics of the surface atoms as a function
of charge density is considered. Beyond the practical considerations of
improving reconstruction of APT data, this work provides an approach for design
of surface chemistry for extreme environments.

This solution shows that for low wall conductance ratios $c\ll1,$ an extremely
strong magnetic field with the Hartmann number $Ha\sim c^{-4}$ is required to
attain the asymptotic flow regime considered in the previous studies. We use a
vector stream function/vorticity formulation and a Chebyshev collocation method
to solve the eigenvalue problem for three-dimensional small-amplitude
perturbations in ducts with realistic wall conductance ratios $c=1,0.1,0.01$

sufficiently strong magnetic field is found to occur in the side-wall jets with
the characteristic thickness $\delta\sim Ha^{-1/2}.$ This results in the
critical Reynolds number and wavenumber increasing asymptotically with the
magnetic field as $Re_{c}\sim110Ha^{1/2}$ and $k_{c}\sim0.5Ha^{1/2}.$ The

debated, with a variety of candidates put forward for the critical exponents.
This includes those derived by Duplantier and Saleur (DS) for an exactly
solvable model. We use a representation of the problem via the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma
model in the limit $N \rightarrow 1$ to determine the stability of this
critical point. First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so
long as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice
model, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical
question. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,
apparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of
relevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about
the stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle
differences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not
strictly in the DS universality class). Next, we allow the polymer to cross
itself, as appropriate e.g. to the quasi-2D case. This introduces an additional
independent relevant perturbation, so we do not expect the DS exponents to
apply. The exponents in the case with crossings will be those of the generic
tricritical $O(n)$ model at $n=0$, and different to the case without crossings.
We also discuss interesting features of the operator content of the $CP^{N-1}$
model. Simple geometrical arguments show that two operators in this field
theory, with very different symmetry properties, have the same scaling
dimension for any value of $N$ (equivalently, any value of the loop fugacity).
Also we argue that for any value of $N$ the $CP^{N-1}$ model has a marginal
parity-odd operator which is related to the loops' winding angle.

nuclei contain stars, stellar mass black holes, and other stellar remnants,
which perturb the disk gas gravitationally. The resulting density perturbations
in turn exert torques on the embedded masses causing them to migrate through
the disk in a manner analogous to the behavior of planets in protoplanetary
disks. We determine the strength and direction of these torques using an
empirical analytic description dependent on local disk gradients, applied to
two different analytic, steady-state disk models of SMBH accretion disks. We
find that there are radii in such disks where the gas torque changes sign,
trapping migrating objects. Our analysis shows that major migration traps
generally occur where the disk surface density gradient changes sign from
positive to negative, around 20--300$R_{\rm g}$, where $R_{\rm g}=2GM/c^{2}$ is
the Schwarzschild radius. At these traps, massive objects in the AGN disk can
accumulate, collide, scatter, and accrete. Intermediate mass black hole
formation is likely in these disk locations, which may lead to preferential gap
and cavity creation at these radii. Our model thus has significant implications
for SMBH growth as well as gravitational wave source populations.

derived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completeness
and dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects. The unknown age
gradient in M31's disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in our
derived metallicity gradient. However, spectroscopic analyses of galaxies
similar to M31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make this
systematic error comparable to the 1$\sigma$ error on our metallicity gradient
measurement. In addition to the metallicity gradient, we observe an asymmetric
local enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3-6 kpc that appears to be

perturbative effects of long-range interactions were too weak to reach novel
quantum phases. Here we experimentally realize a bosonic lattice model with
competing short- and infinite-range interactions, and observe the appearance of
four distinct phases - a superfluid, a supersolid, a Mott insulator and a

optical lattice inside a high finesse optical cavity. The strength of the
short-ranged on-site interactions is controlled by means of the optical lattice
depth. The infinite-range interaction potential is mediated by a vacuum mode of
the cavity and is independently controlled by tuning the cavity resonance. When
probing the phase transition between the Mott insulator and the charge density
wave in real-time, we discovered a behaviour characteristic of a first order
phase transition. Our measurements have accessed a regime for quantum
simulation of many-body systems, where the physics is determined by the
intricate competition between two different types of interactions and the zero

For the [O III] targets, ~50 per cent have ionised gas velocities indicative of

overall line-widths >~600 km/s). The most luminous half (i.e., Lx>6x10^43

our results, we find no evidence that X-ray obscured AGN are more likely to

outflows, for a fixed AGN luminosity, despite an order-of-magnitude decrease in
average star-formation rates over this redshift range. Furthermore, we compare
our Halpha targets to a redshift-matched sample of star-forming galaxies and
despite a similar distribution of Halpha luminosities and likely star-formation
rates, we find extreme ionised gas velocities are up to ~10x more prevalent in
the AGN-host galaxies. Our results reveal a high prevalence of extreme ionised
gas velocities in high-luminosity X-ray AGN and imply that the most powerful
ionised outflows in high-redshift galaxies are driven by AGN activity.

limited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of
multi transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual
inclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in a
transit-based survey. This paper begins an exploration of the effectiveness of
dynamical mechanisms in exciting orbital inclination within exoplanetary
systems of this class. For these tightly packed systems, we determine that the
orbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably through
self-excitation. In contrast, the two Kepler multi-planet systems with
additional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of their
inclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations could
be due to planet-planet interactions alone. We also provide constraints and
predictions for the expected transit duration variations (TDVs) for each
planet. In these multi-planet compact Kepler systems, oscillations of their
inclination angles are remarkably hard to excite; as a result, they tend to
remain continually mutually transiting (CMT-stable). We study this issue
further by augmenting the planet masses and determining the enhancement factor
required for oscillations to move the systems out of transit. The oscillations
of inclination found here inform the recently suggested dichotomy in the sample

configurations, utilizing three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. We show that a quasi-steady equilibrium state is established as
rapidly for MHD as for HD models unless the initial magnetic field is very
strong or very weak, which requires more time to reach saturation. Remarkably,
models with initial magnetic energy varying by two orders of magnitude approach
the same asymptotic state. In the fully saturated state of the fiducial model,
the integrated energy proportions E_kin:E_th:E_mag,t:E_mag,o are

equilibrium SFR for a local region in a galaxy based on its observed gas and
stellar surface densities and velocity dispersions. As the ISM weight (or
dynamical equilibrium pressure) is fixed, an increase in $\eta$ from turbulent
magnetic fields reduces the predicted \Sigma_SFR by ~25% relative to the HD

reionization ended slightly later than observed. However, a simple temporal
rescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement with
observations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formation
history, CMB electron scattering optical depth and galaxy UV luminosity
function with their observed values. Photoionization heating suppressed the
star formation of haloes below ~2 x 10^9 Msun , decreasing the abun- dance of
faint galaxies around MAB_1600 = [-10,-12]. For most of reionization, star
formation was dominated by haloes between 10^10 - 10^11 Msun , so low-mass halo
suppression was not reflected by a distinct feature in the global star
formation history. (Abridged)

quasar host galaxy, to a jet launched by the supermassive black hole, or to
relativistic particles accelerated in a wide-angle radiatively-driven outflow.
In this paper we examine whether radio emission from radio-quiet quasars is a
byproduct of star formation in their hosts. To this end we use infrared
spectroscopy and photometry from Spitzer and Herschel to estimate or place
upper limits on star formation rates in hosts of ~300 obscured and unobscured
quasars at z<1. We find that low-ionization forbidden emission lines such as
[NeII] and [NeIII] are likely dominated by quasar ionization and do not provide
reliable star formation diagnostics in quasar hosts, while PAH emission
features may be suppressed due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the
quasar radiation field. While the bolometric luminosities of our sources are
dominated by the quasars, the 160 micron fluxes are likely dominated by star
formation, but they too should be used with caution. We estimate median star
formation rates to be 6-29 Msun/year, with obscured quasars at the high end of
this range. This star formation rate is insufficient to explain the observed
radio emission from quasars by an order of magnitude, with log(L_radio,
observed/L_radio, SF)=0.6-1.3 depending on quasar type and star formation
estimator. Although radio-quiet quasars in our sample lie close to the 8-1000
micron infrared / radio correlation characteristic of the star-forming
galaxies, both their infrared emission and their radio emission are dominated
by the quasar activity, not by the host galaxy.

(EO), EO=2\HP and 4\HP, for very low metallicity, Z=0.0005. The input physics,

By comparing the synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) obtained from the
different sets of models with envelope overshooting EO=0.7\HP (the standard
{\sl\,PARSEC} tracks), 2\HP and 4\HP, with deep observations of the Sagittarius
dwarf irregular galaxy (SagDIG), we find an overshooting scale EO=2\HP to best
reproduce the observed loops. This result is consistent with that obtained by
\citet{Tang_etal14} for Z in the range 0.001-0.004. We also discuss the
dependence of the blue loop extension on the adopted instability criterion and
find that, contrary to what stated in literature, the Schwarzschild criterion,
instead of the Ledoux criterion, favours the development of blue loops. Other
factors that could affect the CMD comparisons such as differential internal
extinction or the presence of binary systems are found to have negligible
effects on the results. We thus confirm that, in presence of core overshooting

generating a small-depth look-ahead tree. Our procedures can also be used in

in the scalar channel and generates dynamically the $f_0(500)$ pole, the pole
position lying within experimental determinations. Previous $T=0$ results with
this model are updated using newer analysis of pion scattering data. We
calculate the pion scattering amplitude at finite $T$ and show that it
satisfies exactly thermal unitarity, which had been assumed but not formally
proven in previous works. We discuss the main differences with the $T=0$ result
and we show that one can define a proper renormalization scheme with $T=0$
counterterms such that the renormalized amplitude can be chosen to depend only
on a few parameters. Next, we analyze the behaviour of the $f_0(500)$ pole at
finite $T$, which is consistent with chiral symmetry restoration when the
scalar susceptibility is saturated by the $f_0(500)$ state, in a second-order
transition scenario and in accordance with lattice and theoretical analysis.

  Our findings suggest that the onset of these events occurs primarily at large
distances from the cluster core ($>400$ kpc), and that the trajectories of the
affected galaxies feature high impact parameters. Simple models show that such
trajectories are highly improbable for galaxy infall along filaments but common
for infall at high velocities, even after observational biases are accounted
for, provided the duration of the resulting RPS events is $\lesssim$500 Myr. We
thus tentatively conclude that extreme RPS events are preferentially triggered
by cluster mergers, an interpretation that is supported by the disturbed
dynamical state of many of the host clusters. This hypothesis implies that
extreme RPS might occur also near the cores of merging poor clusters or even
merging groups of galaxies.

MHD there is a natural maximum aspect ratio (ratio of sheet length and breadth
to thickness) which may be reached for current sheets with a macroscopic length
L, the limit being provided by the fact that the tearing mode growth time
becomes of the same order as the Alfv\`en time calculated on the macroscopic
scale (Pucci and Velli (2014)). For current sheets with a smaller aspect ratio
than critical the normalized growth rate tends to zero with increasing
Lundquist number S, while for current sheets with an aspect ratio greater than
critical the growth rate diverges with S. Here we carry out a similar analysis
but with electron inertia as the term violating magnetic flux conservation:
previously found scalings of critical current sheet aspect ratios with the
Lundquist number are generalized to include the dependence on the ratio
$(d_e/L)^2$ where de is the electron skin depth, and it is shown that there are
limiting scalings which, as in the resistive case, result in reconnecting modes
growing on ideal time scales. Finite Larmor Radius effects are then included
and the rescaling argument at the basis of ""ideal"" reconnection is proposed to
explain secondary fast reconnection regimes naturally appearing in numerical

high fidelity is of central importance to quantum information science.
Unfortunately for the simplest system of a uniform chain (a spin chain or a
particle in a one-dimensional lattice), the state transfer time grows
exponentially in the chain length $N$ at fixed fidelity. In this work we show
that the addition of an impurity near each endpoint, coupled to the uniform
chain with strength $w$, is sufficient to ensure efficient and high-fidelity
state transfer. An eigenstate localized in the vicinity of the impurity can be
tuned into resonance with chain extended states by tuning $w(N)\propto
N^{1/2}$; the resulting avoided crossing yields resonant eigenstates with large
amplitudes on the chain endpoints and approximately equidistant eigenvalues.
The state transfer time scales as $t\propto N^{3/2}$ and its fidelity $F$
approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$; the error scales as
$1-F\propto N^{-1}$. Thus, with the addition of two impurities, asymptotically
perfect state transfer with a uniform chain is possible even in the absence of
external control.

graphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs
to be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case.
In addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is
close to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics.
We also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of
interventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized
adaptive learning algorithms.
  For general chordal graphs, we derive worst case lower bounds on the number
of interventions. Building on observations about induced trees, we give a new
deterministic adaptive algorithm to learn directions on any chordal skeleton
completely. In the worst case, our achievable scheme is an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm where $\alpha$ is the independence number of
the graph. We also show that there exist graph classes for which the sufficient
number of experiments is close to the lower bound. In the other extreme, there
are graph classes for which the required number of experiments is
multiplicatively $\alpha$ away from our lower bound.
  In simulations, our algorithm almost always performs very close to the lower
bound, while the approach based on separating systems for complete graphs is
significantly worse for random chordal graphs.

to urban crime, have employed machine learning tools to learn and predict
adversary behavior using available data about defender-adversary interactions.
Given these recent developments, this paper commits to an approach of directly
learning the response function of the adversary. Using the PAC model, this
paper lays a firm theoretical foundation for learning in SSGs (e.g.,
theoretically answer questions about the numbers of samples required to learn
adversary behavior) and provides utility guarantees when the learned adversary
model is used to plan the defender's strategy. The paper also aims to answer
practical questions such as how much more data is needed to improve an
adversary model's accuracy. Additionally, we explain a recently observed
phenomenon that prediction accuracy of learned adversary behavior is not enough
to discover the utility maximizing defender strategy. We provide four main
contributions: (1) a PAC model of learning adversary response functions in
SSGs; (2) PAC-model analysis of the learning of key, existing bounded
rationality models in SSGs; (3) an entirely new approach to adversary modeling
based on a non-parametric class of response functions with PAC-model analysis
and (4) identification of conditions under which computing the best defender
strategy against the learned adversary behavior is indeed the optimal strategy.
Finally, we conduct experiments with real-world data from a national park in

stars. Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by
the evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many
single O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular
momentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that
star blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin
rates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total
sample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and
other determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average
equatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s
for these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging
from 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\sim$ 100\% difference
between HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous
spins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been
measured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass
transfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the
evolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer
rapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational
velocity $v_e \sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars
in our sample is 65\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the
relatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing
rotational spin-down must be efficient. A challenge to tidal synchronization
theory is that the two longest-period binaries in our sample (with periods of
29.7 and 78.5 days) unexpectedly display super-synchronous rotation.

larger than previously reported because of inaccuracy in the code used by the

are also in tension with low-redshift data sets, including Planck's own
measurement of the CMB lensing power spectrum (2.4 sigma), and the most precise
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination (2.5 sigma). The Hubble

and delayed signals from neutron capture by either Gadolinium (Gd) or Hydrogen
(H). This paper is dedicated to the latest nH analysis in Double Chooz.
Typically, The Gd analysis is primary since fewer background events are
involved. However, with accurate estimates of backgrounds and a precise
reconstruction of energy, the nH analysis gives a powerful independent
measurement of $\theta_{13}$.

any strength, which Poincar\'e showed to be integrable. The absolute motion of
one vortex is generally biperiodic: in uniformly rotating axes, the motion is
periodic. There are two kinds of relative equilibrium configuration: two
equilateral triangles and one or three colinear configurations, their stability
conditions split the strengths space into three domains in which the sets of
trajectories are topologically distinct.
  According to the values of the strengths and the initial positions, all
possible %RC motions are classified. Two sets of strengths lead to generic
motions other than biperiodic. First, when the angular momentum vanishes,
besides the biperiodic regime there exists an expansion spiral motion and even
a triple collision in a finite time, but the latter motion is nongeneric.
Second, when two strengths are opposite, the system also exhibits the elastic
diffusion of a vortex doublet by the third vortex.
  For given values of the invariants, the volume of the phase space of this
Hamiltonian system is proportional to the period of the reduced motion, a well
known result of the theory of adiabatic invariants. We then formally examine
the behaviour of the quantities that Onsager defined only for a large number of
interacting vortices.

that the corresponding linearized Hamiltonian system at such an elliptic

$(n-2)$ systems is the essential part of the linearized Hamiltonian system at
an elliptic Euler collinear solution of a $3$-body problem whose mass parameter
is modified. Then the linear stability of such a solution in the $n$-body

solutions of the $3$-body problems, which for example then can be further
understood using numerical results of Martin\'ez, Sam\`a and Sim\'o in

any anisotropy with respect to the electron recoil direction is constrained to
have a magnitude of less than a tenth of that present in the proton recoil

how neurons integrate the input from so many synapses and what kind of
large-scale network behavior this enables. It has been previously proposed that
non-linear properties of dendrites enable neurons to recognize multiple
patterns. In this paper we extend this idea by showing that a neuron with
several thousand synapses arranged along active dendrites can learn to
accurately and robustly recognize hundreds of unique patterns of cellular
activity, even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation.
We then propose a neuron model where some of the patterns recognized by a
neuron lead to action potentials and define the classic receptive field of the
neuron, whereas the majority of the patterns recognized by a neuron act as
predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without immediately generating
an action potential. We then present a network model based on neurons with
these properties and show that the network learns a robust model of time-based
sequences. Given the similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex
and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose
that this form of sequence memory is a universal property of neocortical
tissue. We further propose that cellular layers in the neocortex implement
variations of the same sequence memory algorithm to achieve different aspects
of inference and behavior. The neuron and network models we introduce are
robust over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse
distributed code of cellular activations. The sequence capacity of the network
scales linearly with the number of synapses on each neuron. Thus neurons need
thousands of synapses to learn the many temporal patterns in sensory stimuli
and motor sequences.

the films form in a supersaturated state before transforming to a solid film.
Molecular aggregates corresponding to subcritical nuclei in the crystallization
process are inferred from optical spectroscopy measurements of the
supersaturated region. Strain-free solid films exhibit a temperature-dependent
blue shift of optical absorption peaks due to a continuous thermally driven
change of the crystalline packing. As crystalline films are cooled to ambient
temperature they become strained although cracking of thicker films is
observed, which allows the strain to partially relax. Below a critical
thickness, cracking is not observed and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
measurements confirm that the thinnest films are constrained to the lattice
constants corresponding to the temperature at which they were deposited.
Optical spectroscopy results show that the transition temperature between Form
I (room temperature phase) and Form II (high temperature phase) depends on the
film thickness, and that Form I can also be strain-stabilized up to
135$^\circ$C.

simple recipe to characterize the shape of these shadows and determine the

black hole, namely a black hole surrounded by a geometrically thin and
optically thick accretion disk. While the boundary of the shadow of black holes
surrounded by an optically thin emitting medium corresponds to the apparent
photon capture sphere, that of dressed black holes corresponds to the apparent
image of the innermost stable circular orbit. Even in this case, we can
characterize the shape of the shadow and infer the black hole spin and viewing
angle. The shape and the size of the shadow of a dressed black hole are
strongly affected by the black hole spin and inclination angle. Despite that,
it seems that we cannot extract any additional information from it. Here we
study the possibility of testing the Kerr metric. Even with the full knowledge
of the boundary of the shadow, those of Kerr and non-Kerr black holes are very
similar and it is eventually very difficult to distinguish the two cases.

for image retrieval from millions of images based on user-drawn sketches.
Unlike existing methods for this problem which are sensitive to even

scale (i.e. a similarity transformation) and small deformations. The object
boundaries are represented as chains of connected segments and the database
images are pre-processed to obtain such chains that have a high chance of
containing the object. This is accomplished using two approaches in this work:
a) extracting long chains in contour segment networks and b) extracting
boundaries of segmented object proposals. These chains are then represented by
similarity-invariant variable length descriptors. Descriptor similarities are
computed by a fast Dynamic Programming-based partial matching algorithm. This
matching mechanism is used to generate a hierarchical k-medoids based indexing
structure for the extracted chains of all database images in an offline process
which is used to efficiently retrieve a small set of possible matched images
for query chains. Finally, a geometric verification step is employed to test
geometric consistency of multiple chain matches to improve results. Qualitative
and quantitative results clearly demonstrate superiority of the approach over

sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the
distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the

massive particle is to be produced as a result of the high-energy collision,
which has negative energy and necessarily falls into the black hole, the upper
limit of the energy-extraction efficiency is increased to $(2+\sqrt{3})^2
\simeq 13.9$. Thus, higher efficiency of the energy extraction, which is
typically as large as 10, provides strong evidence for the production of a
heavy particle.

  Learning for Image Segmentation","IMT PhD thesis, 2015",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image segmentation is the problem of partitioning an image into different
subsets, where each subset may have a different characterization in terms of
color, intensity, texture, and/or other features. Segmentation is a fundamental
component of image processing, and plays a significant role in computer vision,
object recognition, and object tracking. Active Contour Models (ACMs)
constitute a powerful energy-based minimization framework for image
segmentation, which relies on the concept of contour evolution. Starting from
an initial guess, the contour is evolved with the aim of approximating better
and better the actual object boundary. Handling complex images in an efficient,
effective, and robust way is a real challenge, especially in the presence of
intensity inhomogeneity, overlap between the foreground/background intensity
distributions, objects characterized by many different intensities, and/or
additive noise. In this thesis, to deal with these challenges, we propose a
number of image segmentation models relying on variational level set methods
and specific kinds of neural networks, to handle complex images in both
supervised and unsupervised ways. Experimental results demonstrate the high
accuracy of the segmentation results, obtained by the proposed models on
various benchmark synthetic and real images compared with state-of-the-art
active contour models.

  The proposed hybrid algorithm was evaluated against solutions which base
their play-out strategy purely on bandwidth or buffer level assessment. The

with a mobile node. The evaluation shows that the hybrid approach in most cases
achieves better results compared to its competitors, being able to stream the

Matsumoto--Yor (MY) property on trees considered in \cite{MW04}. The parallel
concerns a multivariate version of the Kummer distribution, which is generated
by a tree. Given a tree of size $p$, we direct it by choosing a vertex, say
$r$, as a root. With such a directed tree we associate a map $\Phi_r$. For a
random vector ${\bf S}$ having a $p$-variate tree-Kummer distribution and any
root $r$, we prove that $\Phi_r({\bf S})$ has independent components. Moreover,
we show that if ${\bf S}$ is a random vector in $(0,\infty)^p$ and for any leaf
$r$ of the tree the components of $\Phi_r({\bf S})$ are independent, then one
of these components has a Gamma distribution and the remaining $p-1$ components
have Kummer distributions. Our point of departure is a relatively simple
independence property due to \cite{HV15}. It states that if $X$ and $Y$ are
independent random variables having Kummer and Gamma distributions (with
suitably related parameters) and $T:(0,\infty)^2\to(0,\infty)^2$ is the
involution defined by $T(x,y) =(y/(1+x), x+xy/(1+x))$, then the random vector
$T(X,Y)$ has also independent components with Kummer and gamma distributions.
By a method inspired by a proof of a similar result for the MY property, we
show that this independence property characterizes the gamma and Kummer laws.

deposited deep inside the atmospheres of these ""hot Jupiters"". Here, we study
extended power sources which distribute heat from the photosphere to the deep
interior of the planet. Our analytical treatment is a generalization of a
previous analysis of localized ""point sources"". We model the deposition profile
as a power law in the optical depth and find that planetary cooling and
contraction halt when the internal luminosity (i.e. cooling rate) of the planet
drops below the heat deposited in the planet's convective region. A slowdown in
the evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources
which do not extend to the planet's center. We estimate the Ohmic dissipation
resulting from the interaction between the atmospheric winds and the planet's
magnetic field, and apply our analytical model to Ohmically heated planets. Our
model can account for the observed radii of most inflated planets which have
equilibrium temperatures $\approx 1500\textrm{K}-2500\textrm{K}$, and are
inflated to a radius $\approx 1.6 R_J$. However, some extremely inflated
planets remain unexplained by our model. We also argue that Ohmically inflated
planets have already reached their equilibrium phase, and no longer contract.
Following Wu & Lithwick who argued that Ohmic heating could only suspend and
not reverse contraction, we calculate the time it takes Ohmic heating to
re-inflate a cold planet to its equilibrium configuration. We find that while
it is possible to re-inflate a cold planet, the re-inflation timescales are
longer by a factor of $\approx 30$ than the cooling time.

analysis that covers its application as a risk measure and as a vector norm.
For both areas of application the theory is revised in detail and examples are
given to show how to apply the concept in practice.
  In the first part, CVaR as a risk measure is introduced and the analysis
covers the mathematical definition of CVaR and different methods to calculate
it. Then, CVaR optimization is analysed in the context of portfolio selection
and how to apply CVaR optimization for hedging a portfolio consisting of
options. The original contributions in this part are an alternative proof of
Acerbi's Integral Formula in the continuous case and an explicit programme
formulation for portfolio hedging.
  The second part first analyses the Scaled and Non-Scaled CVaR norm as new
family of norms in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and compares this new norm family to the more
widely known $L_p$ norms. Then, model (or signal) recovery problems are
discussed and it is described how appropriate norms can be used to recover a
signal with less observations than the dimension of the signal. The last
chapter of this dissertation then shows how the Non-Scaled CVaR norm can be
used in this model recovery context. The original contributions in this part
are an alternative proof of the equivalence of two different characterizations
of the Scaled CVaR norm, a new proposition that the Scaled CVaR norm is
piecewise convex, and the entire \autoref{chapter:Recovery_using_CVaR}. Since
the CVaR norm is a rather novel concept, its applications in a model recovery
context have not been researched yet. Therefore, the final chapter of this

Fokker-Planck equation (GQFPE) appropriate for photo-induced quantum dynamical
processes. The path integral method pioneered by Caldeira and Leggett (CL)
[Caldeira and Leggett, Physica A 121, 587 (1983)] is extended for a
nonequilibrium influence functional, which has been obtained for general cases
where the ground and the excited electronic state baths can be different. Both
nonequilibrium and non-Markovian effects are accounted for consistently by
expanding the paths in the exponents of the influence functional with respect
to time up to the second order. This procedure results in approximations
involving only single time integrations for the exponents of the influence
functional but with additional time dependent boundary terms that have been
ignored in previous works. The boundary terms complicate the derivation of a
time evolution equation, but do not affect position dependent physical
observables or the dynamics in the steady state limit. For an effective density
operator with the boundary terms factored out, a time evolution equation is
derived through short time expansion of the effective action followed by
Gaussian integrations in analytically continued complex domain of space. This
leads to a compact form of GQFPE with time dependent kernels and additional
terms, which make the resulting equation the Dekker form [H. Dekker, Phys. Rep.
80, 1 (1981)]. Major terms of the equation are analyzed for the case of Ohmic
spectral density with Drude cutoff, which shows that the new GQFPE satisfies
the positive definiteness condition in medium to high temperature limit.

limit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that
simultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical
process. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum
mechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime
impossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as
any kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and
there has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the
properties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,
084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact
t=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and
that it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This
work seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these
suggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used
by HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by
virtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating
a t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis
calls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an
exact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+
limit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather
equal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate
expression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path
integral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear
response theory. It is shown that the t=0+ limit of the new rate expression
vanishes in the exact quantum limit.

  laws with discontinuous fluxes","15 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper proposes a scheme by combining the Runge-Kutta discontinuous
Galerkin method with a {\delta}-mapping algorithm for solving hyperbolic
conservation laws with discontinuous fluxes. This hybrid scheme is particularly
applied to nonlinear elasticity in heterogeneous media and multi-class traffic
flow with inhomogeneous road conditions. Numerical examples indicate the
scheme's efficiency in resolving complex waves of the two systems. Moreover,
the discussion implies that the so-called {\delta}-mapping algorithm can also
be combined with any other classical methods for solving similar problems in
general.

harmonic coupling Kuramoto system. A novel transformation is provided, and it
gives cluster synchronization by the periodic properties of the density
function. The periodic properties of the density function also make the cluster
sections' boundaries barrier-like, which helps to explain the sensitiveness of
cluster synchronization on the initial conditions of the oscillators. Detailed
numerical studies confirm the theoretical predictions from this new view of the
symmetry transformation. The work is very beneficial to the further study on
cluster synchronization in various systems.

interpolation in the flat, polynomial limit corresponding to Taylor expansion
and the Vandermonde basis of geometric moments. With this spectral
approximation, a top-down octree-scoping of an interpolant is found by
recursively decomposing the residual, similar to the work of Driscoll and
Heryudono (2007), except that in the current approach the grid is decoupled
from the low rank approximation, allowing partial separation of sampling errors
(the mesh) from representation errors (the polynomial order). Then, it is
possible to demonstrate roughly 5 orders of magnitude improvement in free-mesh
interpolation errors for the three-dimensional Franke function, relative to
previous benchmarks. As in related work on $N$-body methods for factorization
by square root iteration (Challacombe 2015), some emphasis is placed on
resolution of the identity.

criteria on the polynomial coefficients of $L$ which guarantees that $L$ is
essentially self-adjoint, $\bar{L}\geq-CI$ for some $C<\infty,$ and that
$\mathcal{S}$ is a core for $\left( \bar{L}+C\right) ^{r}$ for all $r\geq0.$
Given another polynomial coefficient differential operator, $\tilde{L},$ we
will further give criteria on the coefficients $L$ and $\tilde{L}$ which
implies operator comparison inequalities of the form $\left( \overline

tensor theory allows an enhanced coupling of its fundamental long-range real
scalar field as well as its external scalar field to the electromagnetic field,
according to the author's previous papers. Several possible sources that could
mimic the predicted effect have been ruled out. Finally, it seems likely that
the predicted effect is there with the right order of magnitude, as expected.

dimensional holographic superconductor is to start from the definition of a
time dependent $AdS_3$ background. As originally proposed, many of these
formulae were cast in exponential form, but the adoption of the numeric method
of expression throughout the bulk serves to show more clearly the relationship
between the various parameters. The time dependence behaviour of the scalar
condensation and Maxwell fields are fitted numerically. A usual value for
Maxwell field on AdS horizon is $\exp(-bt)$, and the exponential $\log$ ratio
is therefore $10^{-8} s^{-1}$. The coefficient $b$ of the time in the
exponential term $\exp(-bt)$ can be interpreted as a tool to measure the degree
of dynamical instability, its reciprocal $\frac{1}{b}$ is the time in which the
disturbance is multiplied in the ratio. A discussion of some of the exponential
formulae is given by the scalar field $\psi(z,t)$ near the AdS boundary. It
might be possible that a long interval would elapse the system which tends to
the equilibrium state when the normal mass and conformal dimensions emerged. A
somewhat curious calculation has been made, to illustrate the holographic
entanglement entropy for this system. The foundation of all this calculation
is, of course, a knowledge of multiple (connected and disconnected) extremal
surfaces. There are several cases in which exact and approximate solutions are
jointly used, a variable numerical quantity is represented by a graph, and the
principles of approximation are then applied to determine related numerical
quantities. In the case of the disconnected phase with a finite extremal are,
we find a discontinuity in the first derivative of the entanglement entropy as
the conserved charge $J$ is increased.
