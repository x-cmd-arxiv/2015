work of Kawai, Matsuo and Yokokura has shown that, under a few assumptions, the
collapse of matter does not lead to event horizon nor apparent horizon. In this
paper, we relax their assumptions and elaborate on the space-time geometry of a
generic collapsing body with spherical symmetry. The geometry outside the
collapsing sphere is found to be approximated by the geometry outside the
white-hole horizon, hence the collapsing matter remains outside the
Schwarzschild radius. As particles in Hawking radiation are created in the
vicinity of the collapsing matter, the information loss paradox is alleviated.
Assuming that the collapsing body evaporates within finite time, there is no
event horizon.

with low operational cost, loss tomography has received considerable attentions
in recent years. A number of parameter estimation methods have been proposed
for loss tomography of networks with a tree structure as well as a general
topological structure. However, these methods suffer from either high
computational cost or insufficient use of information in the data. In this
paper, we provide both theoretical results and practical algorithms for
parameter estimation in loss tomography. By introducing a group of novel
statistics and alternative parameter systems, we find that the likelihood
function of the observed data from loss tomography keeps exactly the same
mathematical formulation for tree and general topologies, revealing that
networks with different topologies share the same mathematical nature for loss
tomography. More importantly, we discover that a re-parametrization of the
likelihood function belongs to the standard exponential family, which is convex
and has a unique mode under regularity conditions. Based on these theoretical
results, novel algorithms to find the MLE are developed. Compared to existing
methods in the literature, the proposed methods enjoy great computational
advantages.

In Stage
1, they recognize the social dilemma structure of the decision problem at hand

have to choose between gathering additional information to learn the exact
payoffs corresponding to each of the two options or making a choice without
looking at the payoffs. While previous theoretical research suggests that the
mere act of considering one's strategic options in a social dilemma will be met
with distrust, no experimental study has tested this hypothesis. What does
""looking at payoffs"" signal in observers? Do observers' beliefs actually match
decision makers' intentions? Experiment 1 shows that the actual action of
looking at payoffs signals selfish behavior, but it does not actually mean so.
Experiments 2 and 3 show that, when the action of looking at payoffs is
replaced by a self-report question asking the extent to which participants look
at payoffs in their everyday lives, subjects in high looking mode are indeed
more selfish than those in low looking mode, and this is correctly predicted by
observers. These results support Rand and colleagues' Social Heuristics

processing when considering the performance of protocols at layer 2 and above.
This letter studies the impact of fronthaul latency on the performance of
standard Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) protocols, namely Stop and

lower bound of the protocol's key rate in the asymptotic scenario. Using this

rates less than this threshold, it is guaranteed that $A$ and $B$ may distill a
secure secret key; for error rates larger than this threshold, $A$ and $B$
should abort. We demonstrate that this error threshold compares favorably to
several fully quantum protocols. We also comment on some interesting
observations about the behavior of this protocol under certain noise scenarios.

evolutionary status of KIC 9821622 suggests that its Li-rich nature is the
result of internal fresh Li that is synthesized through the Cameron-Fowler

closely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To
test this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure
dependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an
87.47% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an
F1-score of 89.03%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is

  Conference USA, May 2015","Risk, August 2015, pp.48-53",,,"q-fin.PR q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article presents FVA and CVA of a bilateral derivative in a coherent
manner, based on recent developments in fair value accounting and ISDA
standards. We argue that a derivative liability, after primary risk factors
being hedged, resembles in economics an issued variable funding note, and
should be priced at the market rate of the issuer's debt. For the purpose of
determining the fair value, the party on the liability side is economically
neutral to make a deposit to the other party, which earns his current debt rate
and effectively provides funding and hedging for the party holding the
derivative asset. The newly derived partial differential equation for an option
discounts the derivative's receivable part with counterparty's curve and
payable part with own financing curve. The price difference from the
counterparty risk free price, or total counterparty risk adjustment, is
precisely defined by discounting the product of the risk free price and the
credit spread at the local liability curve. Subsequently the adjustment can be
broken into a default risk component -- CVA and a funding component -- FVA,
consistent with a simple note's fair value treatment and in accordance with the
usual understanding of a bond's credit spread consisting of a CDS spread and a
basis. As for FVA, we define a cost -- credit funding adjustment (CFA) and a
benefit -- debit funding adjustment (DFA), in parallel to CVA and DVA and
attributed to counterparty's and own funding basis. This resolves a number of
outstanding FVA debate issues, such as double counting, violation of the law of
one price, misuse of cash flow discounting, and controversial hedging of own
default risk. It also allows an integrated implementation strategy and reuse of
existing CVA infrastructure.

  Evolution",,,"10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.03.018",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of sediment transport, particularly
those during the formation and evolution of bedforms, is of critical scientific
importance and has engineering relevance. Traditional approaches of sediment
transport simulations heavily rely on empirical models, which are not able to
capture the physics-rich, regime-dependent behaviors of the process. With the
increase of available computational resources in the past decade, CFD-DEM
(computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) has emerged as a viable
high-fidelity method for the study of sediment transport. However, a
comprehensive, quantitative study of the generation and migration of different
sediment bed patterns using CFD-DEM is still lacking. In this work,
current-induced sediment transport problems in a wide range of regimes are
simulated, including 'flat bed in motion', `small dune', `vortex dune' and
suspended transport. Simulations are performed by using SediFoam, an
open-source, massively parallel CFD-DEM solver developed by the authors. This
is a general-purpose solver for particle-laden flows tailed for particle
transport problems. Validation tests are performed to demonstrate the
capability of CFD-DEM in the full range of sediment transport regimes.
Comparison of simulation results with experimental and numerical benchmark data
demonstrates the merits of CFD-DEM approach. In addition, the improvements of
the present simulations over existing studies using CFD-DEM are presented. The
present solver gives more accurate prediction of sediment transport rate by
properly accounting for the influence of particle volume fraction on the fluid
flow. In summary, this work demonstrates that CFD-DEM is a promising
particle-resolving approach for probing the physics of current-induced sediment
transport.

(1) We show that the initial segment complexity of a proper sequence $X$ is
bounded from below by a computable function (that is, $X$ is complex) if and
only if $X$ is random with respect to some computable, continuous measure. (2)
We prove that a uniform version of the previous result fails to hold: there is
a family of complex sequences that are random with respect to a single
computable measure such that for every computable, continuous measure $\mu$,
some sequence in this family fails to be random with respect to $\mu$. (3) We
show that there are proper sequences with extremely slow-growing initial
segment complexity, that is, there is a proper sequence the initial segment
complexity of which is infinitely often below every computable function, and
even a proper sequence the initial segment complexity of which is dominated by
all computable functions. (4) We prove various facts about the Turing degrees

$b$, precisely $b>2\chi$ if $f(u)=u(a-bu^\kappa)$ for some $a, b>0$, we show

curves of these galaxies. Our sample shows low mass-to-light ratios
(M/L=0.73$\pm0.39M_\odot/L_\odot$) as expected for young, star-forming dwarfs.
One of the galaxies in our sample has an apparently strongly-falling rotation
curve, reaching zero rotational velocity outside the turnover radius of
$r_{turn}=1.2r_e$. This may be 1) a polar ring galaxy, with a tilted bar within
a face-on disk; 2) a kinematic warp. These scenarios are indistinguishable with
our current data due to limitations of slit alignment inherent to MOS-mode
observations. We consider whether TDGs can be detected based on their tidal
radius, beyond which tidal stripping removes kinematic tracers such as
H$\alpha$ emission. When the tidal radius is less than about twice the turnover
radius, the expected falling rotation curve cannot be reliably measured. This
is problematic for as much as half of our sample, and indeed more generally,
galaxies in groups like these. Further to this, the H$\alpha$ light that
remains must be sufficiently bright to be detected; this is only the case for
three (14%) galaxies in our sample. We conclude that the falling rotation
curves expected of tidal dwarf galaxies are intrinsically difficult to detect.

is the vehicle speed profile across the route. The profile will translate
directly into energy requirements for a given vehicle. However, the vehicle
speed that a given driver chooses will vary from driver to driver and from time
to time, and may be slower, equal to, or faster than the average traffic flow.
If the specific driver speed profile can be predicted, the energy usage can be
optimized across the route chosen. The purpose of this paper is to research the
application of Deep Learning techniques to this problem to identify at the

individual driver repeated drive cycle, which can be used in an optimization

presence of burst oscillations can be used to predict the behaviour of the
blackbody radius during the cooling phase of the bursts. If a burst shows
oscillations, during the cooling phase the blackbody radius remains more or
less constant for ~2 - ~8s, whereas in bursts that do not show oscillations the
blackbody radius either remains constant for more than ~2 - ~8s or it shows a
rapid (faster than ~2s) decrease and increase. Both the presence of burst
oscillations and the time-dependent spectral behaviour of the bursts are
affected by accretion rate. We also found that the rise time and convexity of
the bursts' light curve are different in bursts with and without oscillations
in 4U 1728--34. Bursts with oscillations have a short rise time (~0.5s) and
show both positive and negative convexity, whereas bursts without oscillations
have a long rise time (~1s) and mostly positive convexity. This is consistent
with the idea that burst oscillations are associated with off-equator ignition.

theory relating the change in the apparent contact angle of charged solids to
the surface density of the electrical charge is introduced. Partial wetting,
inherent for polymer films, becomes possible until the threshold surface
density of the electrical charge is gained. The predictions of the theory are
illustrated by plasma-treated polymer films and inflatable latex balloons.
Deflating the plasma treated latex balloons resulted in an essential increase
in the surface charge density of the latex. This increase switched the wetting
regime from partial to complete wetting. The kinetics of hydrophobic recovery
follows the kinetics of the electrical charge leakage from the surfaces of the

Mathematical Finance. The objective of this manuscript is to present an
original self-contained treatment of the multidimensional pricing. During the
past decades the Black-Scholes this model, which essentially is based on the
log-normal assumption, has been increasingly criticised. In particular, it was
noticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more
concentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This
suggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy
processes instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied
in a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the
theory is not so advanced. We present a general method of high-dimensional
option pricing based on a wide range of jump-diffusion models. Namely, we
construct approximation formulas for the price of spread options. It is
important to get an efficient approximation for the respective density
function, since the reward function has usually a simple structure. Instead of
a commonly used tabulation approach, we use the respective m-widths to compare
a wide range of numerical methods. We give an algorithm of almost optimal, in
the sense of the respective m-widths, reconstruction of density functions. To
demonstrate the power of our approach we consider in details a concrete class
of Levy driven processes and present the respective rates of convergence of
approximation formulas. The interrelationship between the theory and tools
reflects the richness and deep connections in Financial Mathematics, Stochastic
Processes, Theory of Martingales, Functional Analysis, Topology and Harmonic
Analysis.

multiple processes: water migration and differentiation, geochemical reactions
and silicate phase transitions, compaction by self-gravity, and ablation. The
model further considers the following energy sources and sinks: tidal heating,
radiogenic heating, geochemical energy released by serpentinization or absorbed
by mineral dehydration, gravitational energy and insolation, and heat transport
by conduction, convection, and advection. We apply the model to Enceladus, by
guessing the initial conditions that would render a structure compatible with
present-day observations, assuming the initial structure to have been
homogeneous. Assuming the satellite has been losing water continually along its
evolution, we postulate that it was formed as a more massive, more icy and more
porous satellite, and gradually transformed into its present day state due to
sustained long-term tidal heating. We consider several initial compositions and
evolution scenarios and follow the evolution for the age of the Solar System,
testing the present day model results against the available observational
constraints. Our model shows the present configuration to be differentiated
into a pure icy mantle, several tens of km thick, overlying a rocky core,
composed of dehydrated rock at the center and hydrated rock in the outer part.
For Enceladus, it predicts a higher rock/ice mass ratio than previously assumed
and a thinner ice mantle, compatible with recent estimates based on gravity
field measurements. Although, obviously, the model cannot be used to explain
local phenomena, it sheds light on the internal structure invoked in
explanations of localized features and activities.

evidence against a local-hidden variable model (LHVM) given that we can collect
only a finite number of trials in any experiment. The notion of statistical
evidence is thereby formulated in the framework of hypothesis testing, where
the null hypothesis is that the experiment can be described by an LHVM. The
statistical confidence with which the null hypothesis of an LHVM is rejected is
quantified by the so-called P-value, where a smaller P-value implies higher

the number of trials is small, or the Bell violation very low. Here, we derive
the optimal P-value for a large class of Bell inequalities. What's more, we
obtain very sharp upper bounds on the P-value for all Bell inequalities. These
values are easily computed from experimental data, and are valid even if we
allow arbitrary memory in the devices. Our analysis is able to deal with

years ago was followed by findings of a series of similar structures in other
compressed elements. Incommensurately modulated structures of the host-guest
type consist of a tetragonal host structure and a guest structure. The guest
structure forms chains of atoms embedded in the channels of host atoms so that
the axial ratio of these subcells along the c axis is not rational. Two types
of the host-guest structures have been found so far: with the host cells
containing 8 atoms and 16 atoms; in these both types the guest cells contain 2
atoms. These crystal structures contain a non-integer number of atom in their
unit cell: tI11* in Bi, Sb, As, Ba, Sr, Sc and tI19* in Na, K, Rb. We consider
here a close structural relationship of these host-guest structures with the
binary alloy phase Au3Cd5-tI32. This phase is related to the family of the
Hume-Rothery phases that is stabilized by the Fermi sphere - Brillouin zone
interaction. From similar considerations for alkali and alkaline-earth elements
a necessary condition for structural stability emerges in which the valence
electrons band overlaps with the upper core electrons and the valence electron
count increases under compression.

can be best constrained by fitting models to observations of nearby low
luminosity galactic nuclei, in particular the well studied sources Sgr~A* and
M87. There has been considerable progress in modeling the central engine of
active galactic nuclei by an accreting supermassive black hole coupled to a
relativistic plasma jet. However, can a single model be applied to a range of
black hole masses and accretion rates? Here we want to compare the latest
three-dimensional numerical model, originally developed for Sgr A* in the
center of the Milky Way, to radio observations of the much more powerful and
more massive black hole in M87. We postprocess three-dimensional GRMHD models
of a jet-producing radiatively inefficient accretion flow around a spinning
black hole using relativistic radiative transfer and ray-tracing to produce
model spectra and images. As a key new ingredient to these models, we allow the
proton-electron coupling in these simulations depend on the magnetic properties
of the plasma. We find that the radio emission in M87 is well described by a
combination of a two-temperature accretion flow and a hot single-temperature
jet. The model fits the basic observed characteristics of the M87 radio core.
The best fit model has a mass-accretion rate of Mdot approx 9x10^{-3} MSUN/YR
and a total jet power of P_j \sim 10^{43} erg/s. Emission at 1.3mm is produced
by the counter jet close to the event horizon. Its characteristic crescent
shape surrounding the black hole shadow could be resolved by future
millimeter-wave VLBI experiments. The model was successfully derived from one
for the supermassive black hole in center of the Milky Way by appropriately
scaling mass and accretion rate. This suggests the possibility that this model
could also apply to a larger range of low-luminosity black holes.

  approximation",,,,,"cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The efficiency of boundary element methods depends crucially on the time
required for setting up the stiffness matrix. The far-field part of the matrix
can be approximated by compression schemes like the fast multipole method or
$\mathcal{H}$-matrix techniques. The near-field part is typically approximated
by special quadrature rules like the Sauter-Schwab technique that can handle
the singular integrals appearing in the diagonal and near-diagonal matrix
elements.
  Since computing one element of the matrix requires only a small amount of
data but a fairly large number of operations, we propose to use general-purpose
graphics processing units (GPGPUs) to handle vectorizable portions of the
computation: near-field computations are ideally suited for vectorization and
can therefore be handled very well by GPGPUs. Modern far-field compression
schemes can be split into a small adaptive portion that exhibits divergent
control flows, and should therefore be handled by the CPU, and a vectorizable
portion that can again be sent to GPGPUs.
  We propose a hybrid algorithm that splits the computation into tasks for CPUs
and GPGPUs. Our method presented in this article is able to reduce the setup
time of boundary integral operators by a significant factor of 19-30 for both
the Laplace and the Helmholtz equation in 3D when using two consumer GPGPUs

controller for a possibly hybrid system is obtained by algorithmically
computing a winning strategy in a two-player game. Such game-solving algorithms
scale poorly as the size of the game graph increases. However, in many
applications, the game graph has a natural hierarchical structure. In this
paper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits
this hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis.
  We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism which
decomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First,
the construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers,
where each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is
decomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the
higher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the
state space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis
problems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional
requirements on lower-level local games.
  Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for
local game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible
winning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of
environment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies
due to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step
of the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller
constructs a play which satisfies all local specifications. We illustrate our
results through an example controlling an autonomous robot in a known,
multistory building.

a novel approach for delivering computing resources to end devices, where
computing power of the devices are enhanced automatically once they are
connected to an Aqua Computing enabled network. The process of resource

constituent parts, and that attains higher levels of integrated information for
couplings for which either all its communities are highly synchronized, or
there is a mixed state of highly synchronized and desynchronized communities.
Both situations are characterized by relatively low chaotic behavior.

coherent state to a maximally spin squeezed Dicke state, relevant for quantum
metrology and quantum information processing. The initial state is the ground
state of an initial linear Hamiltonian which is gradually turned into a final
quadratic Hamiltonian whose ground state is the selected Dicke state. We use
compensating operators to suppress diabatic transitions to unwanted states that
would occur if the change were not slow. We discuss the possibilities of
constructing the compensating operators by sequential application of quadratic
Hamiltonians available in experiments.

Interface (BCI) based on sensorimotor rhythms. In contrast, little is known
about the influence of feedback on P300-based BCIs. There is still an open
question whether feedback affects the regulation of P300 and consequently the
operation of P300-based BCIs. In this paper, for the first time, the influence
of feedback on the P300-based BCI speller task is systematically assessed. For
this purpose, 24 healthy participants performed the classic P300-based BCI
speller task, while only half of them received feedback. Importantly, the
number of flashes per letter was reduced on a regular basis in order to
increase the frequency of providing feedback. Experimental results showed that
feedback could significantly improve the P300-based BCI speller performance, if
it was provided in short time intervals (e.g. in sequences as short as 4 to 6
flashes per row/column). Moreover, our offline analysis showed that providing
feedback remarkably enhanced the relevant ERP patterns and attenuated the
irrelevant ERP patterns, such that the discrimination between target and
nontarget EEG trials increased.

assessing mental workload. Such technology can effectively enhance the
performance of the human-machine interaction and the learning process. When
designing workload estimation algorithms, a crucial signal processing component
is the feature extraction step. Despite several studies on this field, the
spatial properties of the EEG signals were mostly neglected. Since EEG
inherently has a poor spacial resolution, features extracted individually from
each EEG channel may not be sufficiently efficient. This problem becomes more
pronounced when we use low-cost but convenient EEG sensors with limited
stability which is the case in practical scenarios. To address this issue, in
this paper, we introduce a filter bank common spatial patterns algorithm
combined with a feature selection method to extract spatio-spectral features
discriminating different mental workload levels. To evaluate the proposed
algorithm, we carry out a comparative analysis between two representative types
of working memory tasks using data recorded from an Emotiv EPOC headset which
is a mobile low-cost EEG recording device. The experimental results showed that
the proposed spatial filtering algorithm outperformed the state-of-the
algorithms in terms of the classification accuracy.

textiles consists in mechanical properties evaluation. The goal of this study
is to analyze the behavior of knitted fabrics undergoing stretch stress. In
this respect, three types of 2 colors Rib structure (backstripes jacquard,
twillback jacquard and double-layered 3x3 rib fabric) have been presented and
tested for tensile strength and elongation on three directions. First, the
elasticity and the behavior of knitted Rib fabrics were described The fabrics
were knitted using 100% PAN yarns with Nm 1/15x2 on a E5 CMS 330 Stoll V-bed
knitting machine, and have been tested using INSTROM 5587 Tensile Testing
Machine in respect of standards conditions. After a relaxation period, 15
specimens were prepared, being disposed at 0{\deg}, 45{\deg} and 90{\deg}
angles to the wale direction on the flat knitted panel. The tensile strength
and the elongation values were recorded and mean values were computed. After
strength and tensile elongation testing for 3 types of rib based knitted
fabrics, one can see that the double layer knit presents the best mechanical
behavior, followed by birds-eyebacking 2 colors Jacquard and then back striped
Jacquard. For tensile stress in bias direction, the twillbacking Jacquard has a
good breakage resistance value due to the higher number of rib sinker loops in
structure that are positioned on the same direction with the tensile force. The
twillbacking Jacquard structure could be considered as an alternative for the
base material for decorative and home textile products.

safety. The quality of fabric and sewing thread influence the final product and
therefore, sewing defects must be early and accurately detected, in order to
remove the item from production. Airbag seams assembly can take various forms,
using linear and circle primitives, with threads of different colors and length
densities, creating lockstitch or double threads chainstitch. The paper
presents a framework for the automatic detection of defects occurring during
the airbag sewing stage. Types of defects as skipped stitch, missed stitch or
superimposed seam for lockstitch and two threads chainstitch are detected and
marked. Using image processing methods, the proposed framework follows the
seams path and determines if a color pattern of the considered stitches is
valid.
