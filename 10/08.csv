  rings",,,,,"math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An intersection of sets $A = \bigcap_{i \in I}B_i$ is irredundant if no $B_i$
can be omitted from this intersection. We develop a topological approach to
irredundance by introducing a notion of a spectral representation, a spectral
space whose members are sets that intersect to a given set $A$ and whose
topology encodes set membership. We define a notion of a minimal representation
and show that for such representations, irredundance is a topological property.
We apply this approach to intersections of valuation rings and ideals. In the
former case we focus on Krull-like domains and Pr\""ufer $v$-multiplication
domains, and in the latter on irreducible ideals in arithmetical rings. Some of
our main applications are to those rings or ideals that can be represented with
a Noetherian subspace of a spectral representation.

majority of Bose-Fermi systems analyzed in solids and ultracold atomic gases,
the renormalized interaction between the polaritons and electrons in our system

rendered incommensurate with the Fermi momentum. We analyze the prospects for
experimental observation of superconductivity and find that critical
temperatures on the order of a few Kelvins can be achieved in heterostructures
consisting of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers that are embedded in
an open cavity structure. All optical control of superconductivity in

  The problems considered stem from questions about the dual spaces of these

multiplicative Hankel forms. We show that there are bounded, even Schatten

process we supply square function characterizations of the Hardy spaces

their origin. The NaI 5889.95 angstrom line is detected toward all but one
source, while the weaker KI 7698.96 angstrom line in about two thirds of the
sample. The similarity in their peak centroids and the significant positive
correlation between their equivalent widths demonstrate that these transitions
trace the same atomic gas. The absorption lines are present towards both disk
and diskless young stellar objects, which excludes cold gas within the
circumstellar disk as the absorbing material. A comparison of NaI and CO
detections and peak centroids demonstrates that the atomic and molecular gas
are not co-located, the atomic gas is more extended than the molecular gas. The
width of the atomic lines corroborates this finding and points to atomic gas
about an order of magnitude warmer than the molecular gas. The distribution of
NaI radial velocities shows a clear spatial gradient along the length of the
Taurus molecular cloud filaments. This suggests that absorption is associated
with the Taurus molecular cloud. Assuming the gradient is due to cloud
rotation, the rotation of the atomic gas is consistent with differential
galactic rotation while the rotation of the molecular gas, although with the
same rotation axis, is retrograde. Our analysis shows that narrow NaI and KI
absorption resonance lines are useful tracers of the atomic envelope of
molecular clouds. In line with recent findings from giant molecular clouds, our
results demonstrate that the velocity fields of the atomic and molecular gas
are misaligned. The angular momentum of a molecular cloud is not simply
inherited from the rotating Galactic disk from which it formed but may be
redistributed by cloud-cloud interactions.

quantum information using their exotic non-Abelian statistics. Theoretical
modeling of such low-dimensional semiconductors is generally based on
phenomenological effective models. However, a more microscopic understanding of
their band structure and, especially, of the spin-orbit coupling of electrons
in these devices is important for optimizing their parameters for applications
in quantum computing. In this paper, we approach this problem by first
obtaining a highly accurate effective tight-binding model from ab initio
calculations in the bulk. This model is symmetrized and correctly reproduces
both the band structure and the wavefunction character. It is then used to
determine Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit splittings induced by finite size
effects and external electric field in zincblende InSb one- and two-dimensional
nanostructures as a function of growth parameters. The method presented here
enables reliable simulations of realistic devices, including those used to
realize exotic topological states.

matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for quantum chemical applications

for quantum chemistry are based on the traditional formulation of the method,
which was developed from a viewpoint of Hilbert space decimation and attained a
higher performance compared to straightforward implementations of matrix
product based DMRG. The latter variationally optimizes a class of ansatz states
known as matrix product states (MPS), where operators are correspondingly
represented as matrix product operators (MPO). The MPO construction scheme
presented here eliminates the previous performance disadvantages while
retaining the additional flexibility provided by a matrix product approach; for
example, the specification of expectation values becomes an input parameter. In
this way, MPOs for different symmetries - abelian and non-abelian - and
different relativistic and non-relativistic models may be solved by an

reduced to the case of cubics, i.e., $d=3$, the main contribution of this work
is the resolution of this base case. The proposed proof proceeds by induction
on the dimension $n$ of the projective space via a specialization argument.
This reduces the proof to a large number of initial cases for the induction,
which were settled using a computer-assisted proof. The individual base cases
were computationally challenging problems. Indeed, the largest base case

between motor proteins and microtubules, but how these interactions yield such

motor-mediated microtubule interactions. We identify polarity-sorting and
crosslink tether relaxation as two polar-specific sources of active
destabilizing stress. We then develop a continuum Doi-Onsager model that
captures polarity sorting and the hydrodynamic flows generated by these
polar-specific active stresses. In simulations of active nematic flows on
immersed surfaces, the active stresses drive turbulent flow dynamics and
continuous generation and annihilation of disclination defects. The dynamics
follow from two instabilities, and accounting for the immersed nature of the

turning off the hydrodynamics in the Doi-Onsager model, we capture formation of
polar lanes as observed in the Brownian dynamics simulation.

procedures that, up to some fidelity, prepare a quantum object in a pure state.
Such processes occur within Landauer's framework if they rely on an interaction
between the object and a thermal reservoir. Landauer's principle dictates that
this must dissipate a minimum quantity of heat, proportional to the entropy
reduction that is incurred by the object, to the thermal reservoir. However,
this lower bound is only reachable for some specific physical situations, and
it is not necessarily achievable for any given reservoir. The main task of our
work can be stated as the minimisation of heat dissipation given probabilistic
information erasure, i.e., minimising the amount of energy transferred to the
thermal reservoir as heat if we require that the probability of preparing the
object in a specific pure state $|\varphi_1\rangle$ be no smaller than
$p_{\varphi_1}^{\max}-\delta$. Here $p_{\varphi_1}^{\max}$ is the maximum
probability of information erasure that is permissible by the physical context,
and $\delta\geqslant 0$ the error. To determine the achievable minimal heat
dissipation of quantum information erasure within a given physical context, we
explicitly optimise over all possible unitary operators that act on the
composite system of object and reservoir. Specifically, we characterise the
equivalence class of such optimal unitary operators, using tools from
majorisation theory, when we are restricted to finite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. Furthermore, we discuss how pure state preparation processes could be
achieved with a smaller heat cost than Landauer's limit, by operating outside
of Landauer's framework.

reveal an energetic preference for the TMs lying along the GB sites (TM/GB).
Such an energetic preference has been strengthened by increasing the
concentration of the TM adatoms; giving rise to TM nanolines on graphene ruled
by GBs. Further diffusion barrier calculations for Fe adatoms support the
formation of those TM nanolines. We find that the energy barriers parallel to
the GBs are sligthly lower in comparision with those obtained for the defect
free graphene; whereas, perpendicularly to the GBs the Fe adatoms face higher
energy barriers. Fe and Co (Mn) nanolines are ferromagnetic (ferrimagnetic), in
contrast the magnetic state of Ru nanolines is sensitive to the Ru/GB
adsorption geometry. The electronic properties of those TM nanolines were
characterized through extensive electronic band structure calculations. The
formation of metallic nanolines is mediated by a strong hybridization between
the TM and the graphene ($\pi$) orbitals along the GB sites. Due to the net
magnetization of the TM nanolines, our band structure results indicate an

player preferences from selfish behavior on the degradation of system
performance, Nikolova and Stier- Moses [16] defined the concept of the price of
risk aversion as the worst-case ratio of the cost of an equilibrium with
risk-averse players and that of an equilibrium with risk-neutral users. For
risk-averse users who seek to minimize the mean plus variance of travel time on
a path, they proved an upper bound on the price of risk aversion, which is
independent of the latency functions, and grows linearly with the size of the
graph and players' risk-aversion. In this follow-up paper, we provide a
matching lower bound for graphs with number of vertices equal to powers of two,
via the construction of a graph family inductively generated from the Braess
graph. We also provide conceptually different bounds, which we call functional,
that depend on the class of mean latency functions and provide
characterizations that are independent of the network topology (first derived,
in a more complicated way, by Meir and Parkes [10] in a different context with
different techniques). We also supplement the upper bound with a new
asymptotically-tight lower bound. Our third contribution is a tight bound on
the price of risk aversion for a family of graphs that generalize
series-parallel graphs which applies to users minimizing the mean plus standard
deviation of a path, a much more complex model of risk-aversion due to the cost
of a path being non-additive over edge costs. This is a refinement of previous
results in [16] that characterized the price of risk-aversion for

this property was not known to be ""robust"" - the marginals of such states to a
subset of the qubits containing all but a small constant fraction of them may
be only locally entangled, and hence approximable by shallow quantum circuits.
In this work we construct a family of 16-local Hamiltonians for which any

  This provides evidence that quantum entanglement is not very fragile, and
perhaps our intuition about its instability is an artifact of considering local
Hamiltonians which are not only local but spatially local. Formally, it
provides positive evidence for two wide-open conjectures in condensed-matter

the existence of ""good"" quantum LDPC codes, and the NLTS conjecture due to
Freedman and Hastings positing the existence of local Hamiltonians in which any

remain challenging to detect, numerous planetary systems have been discovered
that are very different from our own Solar System. The majority of systems
harbor a new class of planets, bodies that are typically several times more
massive than the Earth but that orbit their host stars well inside the orbit of
Mercury. These planets frequently show evidence for large Hydrogen and Helium
envelopes containing several percent of the planet's mass and display a large
diversity in mean densities. Here we show that this wide range can be achieved
by one or two late giant impacts, which are frequently needed to achieve
long-term orbital stability in multiple planet systems once the gas disk has
disappeared. We demonstrate using hydrodynamical simulations that a single
collision between similarly sized exoplanets can easily reduce the
envelope-to-core-mass ratio by a factor of two and show that this leads to a
corresponding increase in the observed mean density by factors of 2-3. In
addition we investigate how envelope-mass-loss depends on envelope mass, planet
radius, semi-major axis, and the mass distribution inside the envelope. We
propose that a small number of giant impacts may be responsible for the large
observed spread in mean densities, especially for multiple-planet systems
containing planets with very different densities and which have not been
significantly sculpted by photo evaporation.

extending the Standard Model to include a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry

a description of some classic lepton mixing patterns. Lepton mixing may be
regarded as a deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing, with charged lepton
corrections leading to solar mixing sum rules, or tri-maximal lepton mixing
leading to atmospheric mixing rules. We survey neutrino mass models, using a
roadmap based on the open questions in neutrino physics. We then focus on the
seesaw mechanism with right-handed neutrinos, where sequential dominance (SD)
can account for large lepton mixing angles and CP violation, with precise
predictions emerging from constrained SD (CSD). We define the flavour problem
and discuss progress towards a theory of flavour using GUTs and discrete family
symmetry. We classify models as direct, semidirect or indirect, according to
the relation between the Klein symmetry of the mass matrices and the discrete
family symmetry, in all cases focussing on spontaneous CP violation. Finally we
give two examples of realistic and highly predictive indirect models with CSD,
namely an A to Z of flavour with Pati-Salam and a fairly complete $A_4\times

leptogenesis.

dynamics. We study the evolution of hierarchical triples, following the secular
dynamical evolution up to the octupole-level of approximation, including
general relativity, tidal effects and post-main-sequence evolution, such as
mass loss, changes to stellar radii and supernovae. During the dynamical
evolution of the triple system, the ""eccentric Kozai-Lidov"" mechanism can cause
large eccentricity excitations in the LMXB progenitor, resulting in three main
BH-LMXB formation channels. Here we define BH-LMXB candidates as systems where
the inner BH companion star crosses its Roche limit. In the ""eccentric"" channel
(~ 81% of the LMXBs in our simulations), the donor star crosses its Roche limit
during an extreme eccentricity excitation, while still on a wide orbit. Second,
we find a ""giant"" LMXB channel (~ 11%), where a system undergoes only moderate
eccentricity excitations, but the donor star fills its Roche lobe after
evolving toward the giant branch. Third, we identify a ""classical"" channel
(~8%), where tidal forces and magnetic braking shrink and circularize the orbit
to short periods, triggering mass transfer. Finally, for the giant channel, we
predict an eccentric ($\sim 0.3-0.6$), preferably inclined (~40, ~140 degreed)

as Jupiter and Saturn, is to form solid `cores' of roughly 10 M$_\oplus$.
Getting the cores to form before the solar nebula dissipates
($\sim\!1-10\,$Myr) has been a major challenge for planet formation models.
Recently models have emerged in which `pebbles' (centimeter- to meter-size
objects) are first concentrated by aerodynamic drag and then gravitationally
collapse to form 100 --- 1000 km objects. These `planetesimals' can then
efficiently accrete leftover pebbles and directly form the cores of giant
planets. This model known as `pebble accretion', theoretically, can produce 10
M$_\oplus$ cores in only a few thousand years. Unfortunately, full simulations
of this process show that, rather than creating a few 10 M$_\oplus$ cores, it
produces a population of hundreds of Earth-mass objects that are inconsistent
with the structure of the Solar System. Here we report that this difficulty can
be overcome if pebbles form slowly enough to allow the planetesimals to
gravitationally interact with one another. In this situation the largest
planetesimals have time to scatter their smaller siblings out of the disk of
pebbles, thereby stifling their growth. Our models show that, for a large, and
physically reasonable region of parameter space, this typically leads to the
formation of one to four gas giants between 5 and 15 AU in agreement with the
observed structure of the Solar System.

describe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with
data from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that
no slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many
spectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract
interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014)
photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit
simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the
morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has
98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $JH_{IR}\leq 26$ and
22,548 with $JH_{IR}\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.

cool, condense, and form stars. How gas cools is thus a key to understand
galaxy formation. \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} infrared spectroscopy
revealed a population of galaxies with weak star formation and unusually
powerful H$_2$ line emission. This is a signature of turbulent dissipation,
sustained by large-scale mechanical energy injection. The cooling of the
multiphase interstellar medium is associated with emission in the H$_2$ lines.
These results have profound consequences on our understanding of regulation of
star formation, feedback and energetics of galaxy formation in general. The
fact that H$_2$ lines can be strongly enhanced in high-redshift turbulent

absence of long-range interactions, varying the spin-coupling anisotropy leads
to four distinct phases: a ferromagnetic Ising phase, a disordered XY phase, a
topological Haldane phase, and an antiferromagnetic Ising phase. If long-range
interactions are antiferromagnetic and thus frustrated, we find primarily a
quantitative change of the phase boundaries. On the other hand, ferromagnetic
(non-frustrated) long-range interactions qualitatively impact the entire phase
diagram. Importantly, for $\alpha\lesssim3$, long-range interactions destroy
the Haldane phase, break the conformal symmetry of the XY phase, give rise to a
new phase that spontaneously breaks a $U(1)$ continuous symmetry, and introduce
an exotic tricritical point with no direct parallel in short-range interacting
spin chains. We show that the main signatures of all five phases found could be
observed experimentally in the near future.

showing that the quantum spectrum can be derived from a set of Bohr-Sommerfeld

consistent with the classical orbital motion in the polariton band picture. The
underlying idea of our method is quite general and can be applied to other

star, HD 147513 (G5V), are presented here. Robust detections of Zeeman
signatures at all observed epochs indicate a surface magnetic field, with
longitudinal magnetic field strengths varying between 1.0-3.2 G. Radial
velocity variations from night to night modulate on a similar timescale to the
longitudinal magnetic field measurements. These variations are therefore likely
due to the rotational modulation of stellar active regions rather than the much
longer timescale of the planetary orbit (Porb=528 d). Both the longitudinal
magnetic field measurements and radial velocity variations are consistent with
a rotation period of 10 +/- 2 days, which are also consistent with the measured
chromospheric activity level of the star (log R'(HK)=-4.64). Together, these
quantities indicate a low inclination angle, i~18 degrees. We present
preliminary magnetic field maps of the star based on the above period and find
a simple poloidal large-scale field. Chemical analyses of the star have
revealed that it is likely to have undergone a barium-enrichment phase in its
evolution because of a higher mass companion. Despite this, our study reveals
that the star has a fairly typical activity level for its rotation period and
spectral type. Future studies will enable us to explore the long-term evolution
of the field, as well as to measure the stellar rotation period, with greater
accuracy.

for its use in optoelectronic applications. ReS$_2$ crystallizes in the

whose concomitant electronic structure might host a non-trivial topology. Here,
we report an overall evaluation of the anisotropic Raman response and the
transport properties of few-layered ReS$_2$ field-effect transistors. We find
that ReS$_2$ exfoliated on SiO$_2$ behaves as an $n$-type semiconductor with an
intrinsic carrier mobility surpassing $\mu_i$ ~30 cm$^2$/Vs at $T = 300$ K
which increases up to ~350 cm$^2$/Vs at 2 K. Semiconducting behavior is
observed at low electron densities $n$, but at high values of n the resistivity
decreases by a factor > 7 upon cooling to 2 K and displays a metallic
$T^2$-dependence. This indicates that the band structure of
1T$^{\prime}$-ReS$_2$ is quite susceptible to an electric field applied
perpendicularly to the layers. The electric-field induced metallic state
observed in transition metal dichalcogenides was recently claimed to result
from a percolation type of transition. Instead, through a scaling analysis of
the conductivity as a function of $T$ and $n$, we find that the metallic state
of ReS$_2$ results from a second-order metal to insulator transition driven by
electronic correlations. This gate-induced metallic state offers an alternative
to phase engineering for producing ohmic contacts and metallic interconnects in
devices based on transition metal dichalcogenides.

studies at these wavelengths have been limited by low signal to noise ratios
(S/Rs) for individual spectra. Our approach is to average CIRS FP3 spectra to
increase the S/R and use emissivity spectra to constrain the composition of the
dark material on Iapetus. We find an emissivity feature at ~855 cm-1 and a
possible doublet at 660 and 690 cm-1 that do not correspond to any known
instrument artifacts. We attribute the 855 cm-1 feature to fine-grained
silicates, similar to those found in dust on Mars and in meteorites, which are
nearly featureless at shorter wavelengths. Silicates on the dark terrains of
Saturn's icy moons have been suspected for decades, but there have been no
definitive detections until now. Serpentines reported in the literature at
ambient temperature and pressure have features near 855 and 660 cm-1. However,
peaks can shift depending on temperature and pressure, so measurements at
Iapetus-like conditions are necessary for more positive feature
identifications. As a first investigation, we measured muscovite at 125K in a
vacuum and found that this spectrum does match the emissivity feature near 855
cm-1 and the location of the doublet. Further measurements are needed to
robustly identify a specific silicate, which would provide clues regarding the

Directed-Distributed Gradient Descent (D-DGD), to solve multi-agent

with similar problems under the assumption of undirected networks, i.e.,
requiring the weight matrices to be doubly-stochastic. The row-stochasticity of

column-stochasticity ensures that each agent's local gradient contributes
equally to the global objective. In a directed graph, however, it may not be
possible to construct a doubly-stochastic weight matrix in a distributed

each agent to record the change in the state evolution. In each iteration, the
algorithm simultaneously constructs a row-stochastic matrix and a
column-stochastic matrix instead of only a doubly-stochastic matrix. The
convergence of the new weight matrix, depending on the row-stochastic and

optimality. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithm converges at a rate

applied to linear systems in reservoir simulation. In particular, large, sudden

reservoir simulation due to high costs and lack of parallelism. Secondly, we
test a physics-based subdomain-levelset deflation algorithm that constructs the

subdomain-levelset deflation is particularly suitable for a parallel

stars possess a non-trivial scalar field profile. An observer far from a star
is most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile that
decays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,
which is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.
The presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrain
extended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that
gravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been
constrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this
""lore"" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an
example, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density
in the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot
possess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary
pulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems
yielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic
gravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for
slowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,
either neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to
constrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary
constraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar
charge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black
hole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries. We estimate
these constraints to be ten times better than the current estimated bound, and
also include estimated constraints on generic quadratic gravity theories.

symmetry breaking or an instability in the renormalizable part of the potential

of the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down
to the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a
benchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could
be used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter
experiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal-
to-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The
performance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays,
gamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and

Researchers have presented various low-level features-based techniques for

classification and retrieval is still a challenging problem due to complex
nature of visual contents. In addition, the traditional information retrieval
techniques are vulnerable to security risks, making it easy for attackers to
retrieve personal visual contents such as patients records and law enforcement
agencies databases. Therefore, we propose a novel ontology-based framework
using image steganography for secure image classification and information
retrieval. The proposed framework uses domain-specific ontology for mapping the
low-level image features to high-level concepts of ontologies which
consequently results in efficient classification. Furthermore, the proposed
method utilizes image steganography for hiding the image semantics as a secret
message inside them, making the information retrieval process secure from third
parties. The proposed framework minimizes the computational complexity of
traditional techniques, increasing its suitability for secure and real-time
visual contents retrieval from personalized image databases. Experimental

respectively by $\lambda_{\max}^L(G), \lambda_{\max}^Q(G)$ (resp., $\rho^L(G),
\rho^Q(G)$). For a connected non-bipartite simple graph $G$,
$\lambda_{\max}^L(G)=\rho^L(G) < \rho^Q(G)$. But this does not hold for
non-odd-bipartite hypergraphs. We will investigate this problem by considering
a class of generalized power hypergraphs $G^{k,\frac{k}{2}}$, which are
constructed from simple connected graphs $G$ by blowing up each vertex of $G$
into a $\frac{k}{2}$-set and preserving the adjacency of vertices.
  Suppose that $G$ is non-bipartite, or equivalently $G^{k,\frac{k}{2}}$ is
non-odd-bipartite. We get the following spectral properties: (1)
$\rho^L(G^{k,{k \over 2}}) =\rho^Q(G^{k,{k \over 2}})$ if and only if $k$ is a
multiple of $4$; in this case
$\lambda_{\max}^L(G^{k,\frac{k}{2}})<\rho^L(G^{k,{k \over 2}})$. (2) If
$k\equiv 2 (\!\!\!\mod 4)$, then for sufficiently large $k$,
$\lambda_{\max}^L(G^{k,\frac{k}{2}})<\rho^L(G^{k,{k \over 2}})$. Motivated by
the study of hypergraphs $G^{k,\frac{k}{2}}$, for a connected non-odd-bipartite
hypergraph $G$, we give a characterization of $L(G)$ and $Q(G)$ having the same
spectra or the spectrum of $A(G)$ being symmetric with respect to the origin,
that is, $L(G)$ and $Q(G)$, or $A(G)$ and $-A(G)$ are similar via a complex
(necessarily non-real) diagonal matrix with modular-$1$ diagonal entries. So we
give an answer to a question raised by Shao et al., that is, for a
non-odd-bipartite hypergraph $G$, that $L(G)$ and $Q(G)$ have the same spectra
can not imply they have the same $H$-spectra.

computable, baseline properties. We instantiate our construction so as to apply
it to generalized hypercubes and obtain the datacenter networks GQ*. Our
construction automatically yields routing algorithms for GQ* and we empirically
compare GQ* (and its routing algorithms) with the established datacenter
networks FiConn and DPillar (and their routing algorithms); this comparison is
with respect to network throughput, latency, load balancing, fault-tolerance,

to blockages. As a result, mmWave connectivity will be likely to be
intermittent. One promising approach to increasing mmWave connectivity and
range is to use relays. Device-to-device (D2D) communications open the door to
the vast opportunities of D2D and device-to-network relaying for mmWave
cellular systems. In this correspondence, we study how to select a good relay
for a given source-destination pair in a two-hop mmWave cellular system, where
the mmWave links are subject to random Bernoulli blockages. In such a system,
probing more relays could potentially lead to the discovery of a better relay
but at the cost of more overhead. We find that the throughput-optimal relay
probing strategy is a pure threshold policy: the system can stop relay probing
once the achievable spectral efficiency of the currently probed two-hop link
exceeds some threshold. In general, the spectral efficiency threshold can be
obtained by solving a fixed point equation. For the special case with on/off
mmWave links, we derive a closed-form solution for the threshold. Numerical
results demonstrate that the threshold-based relay probing strategy can yield
remarkable throughput gains.

scanning the PUN-list of the itemset and the PUN-lists of long itemsets can be
fast constructed by the PUN-lists of short itemsets. Third, by employing the
utility upper bound lying in the PUN-lists as the pruning strategy, MIP
directly discovers high utility itemsets from the search space, called

compactly represent the target data with as small a distortion as possible. As
a selection method, we study the $\ell_0$- and $\ell_1$-based methods, which
employ the exhaustive search and $\ell_1$-norm regularization techniques,

between the representation distortion and the compression rate. First, we
evaluate the performance analytically in the case that the methods are carried

fact that the $\ell_0$-based method greatly outperforms the $\ell_1$-based one.
Second, we examine the practical performances of two well-known algorithms,
orthogonal matching pursuit and approximate message passing, when they are used
to execute the $\ell_0$- and $\ell_1$-based methods, respectively. Our
examination shows that orthogonal matching pursuit achieves a much better
performance than the exact execution of the $\ell_1$-based method, as well as
approximate message passing. However, regarding the $\ell_0$-based method,
there is still room to design more effective greedy algorithms than orthogonal
matching pursuit. Finally, we evaluate the performances of the algorithms when

sources and shows an explicit approximation to the minimum source coding rate
required to sustain the probability of exceeding distortion $d$ no greater than
$\epsilon$, which is simpler than known dispersion-based approximations.
  Our approach takes inspiration in the celebrated classical result stating
that the Shannon lower bound to rate-distortion function becomes tight in the
limit $d \to 0$. We formulate an abstract version of the Shannon lower bound
that recovers both the classical Shannon lower bound and the rate-distortion
function itself as special cases. Likewise, we show that a nonasymptotic
version of the abstract Shannon lower bound recovers all previously known
nonasymptotic converses.
  A necessary and sufficient condition for the Shannon lower bound to be
attained exactly is presented. It is demonstrated that whenever that condition
is met, the rate-dispersion function is given simply by the varentropy of the
source. Remarkably, all finite alphabet sources with balanced distortion
measures satisfy that condition in the range of low distortions.
  Most continuous sources violate that condition. Still, we show that lattice
quantizers closely approach the nonasymptotic Shannon lower bound, provided
that the source density is smooth enough and the distortion is low. This
implies that fine multidimensional lattice coverings are nearly optimal in the
rate-distortion sense even at finite $n$. The achievability proof technique is
based on a new bound on the output entropy of lattice quantizers in terms of
the differential entropy of the source, the lattice cell size and a smoothness
parameter of the source density. The technique avoids both the usual random
coding argument and the simplifying assumption of the presence of a dither
signal.

ordered pairs of a ""vertex set""; each color represents a ""constituent digraph.""
CCs arise in the study of permutation groups, combinatorial structures such as
partially balanced designs, and the analysis of algorithms; their history goes
back to Schur in the 1930s. A CC is primitive (PCC) if all its constituent
digraphs are connected.
  We address the problem of classifying PCCs with large automorphism groups.
This project was started in Babai's 1981 paper in which he showed that only the
trivial PCC admits more than $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$ automorphisms. (Here,
$n$ is the number of vertices and the $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic
factors.)
  In the present paper we classify all PCCs with more than
$\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$ automorphisms, making the first progress on Babai's
conjectured classification of all PCCs with more than $\exp(n^{\epsilon})$
automorphisms.
  A corollary to Babai's 1981 result solved a then 100-year-old problem on
primitive but not doubly transitive permutation groups, giving an
$\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$ bound on their order. In a similar vein, our result
implies an $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$ upper bound on the order of such groups,
with known exceptions. This improvement of Babai's result was previously known
only through the Classification of Finite Simple Groups (Cameron, 1981), while
our proof, like Babai's, is elementary and almost purely combinatorial.
  Our analysis relies on a new combinatorial structure theory we develop for
PCCs. In particular, we demonstrate the presence of ""asymptotically uniform
clique geometries"" on PCCs in a certain range of the parameters.

photonic channels requires excellent matching of central frequency and
bandwidth between both nodes and their interfacing photons. However,
pre-existing photon sources can not fulfill this requirement. Using a novel
conjoined double-cavity strategy, we report the generation of nondegenerate
narrow-band photon pairs by cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric
down-conversion. The central frequencies and bandwidths of the signal and idler
photons are independently set to match with trapped ions and solid-state
quantum memories. With this source we achieve the bandwidths and central
frequencies of 4 MHz at 935 nm and 5 MHz at 880 nm for the signal and idler
photons respectively, with a normalized spectrum brightness of 4.9/s/MHz/mW.
Due to the ability of being independently locked to two different wavelenghts,
the conjoined double-cavity is universally suitable for hybrid quantum network
consisting of various quantum nodes.

last outburst on 6 February 2014. This is the second symbiotic recurrent nova
whose light curve at low frequencies has been followed in detail, the first
being RS Ophiuchi in 2006. We fitted the 610 MHz light curve by a model of
synchrotron emission from an expanding shell being modified by radiative
transfer effects due to local absorbing gas consisting of a uniformly
distributed and a clumpy component. Using our model parameters, we find that
the emission at 235 MHz peaked around day 35 which is consistent with our GMRT
observations. The two main results of our study are: (1) The radio emission at
a given frequency is visible sooner after the outburst in successive outbursts
of both V745 Scorpii and RS Ophiuchi. The earlier detection of radio emission
is interpreted to be caused by decreasing foreground densities. (2) The clumpy
material, if exists, is close to the white dwarf and can be interpreted as
being due to the material from the hot accretion disk. The uniform density gas
is widespread and attributed to the winds blown by the white dwarf. We present
implications of these results on the evolution of both novae. Such studies
alongwith theoretical understanding have the potential of resolving several
outstanding issues such as why all recurrent novae are not detectable in
synchrotron radio and whether recurrent novae are progenitor systems of type 1a

magnetoresistance in a single molecule junction arising from negative
differential resistance that shifts in a magnetic field at a rate two orders of
magnitude larger than Zeeman shifts. This sensitivity to the magnetic field
produces two voltage-tunable forms of magnetoresistance, which can be selected
via the applied bias. The negative differential resistance is caused by
transient charging of an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule on a single layer
of copper nitride (Cu2N) on a Cu(001) surface, and occurs at voltages
corresponding to the alignment of sharp resonances in the filled and empty
molecular states with the Cu(001) Fermi energy. An asymmetric voltage-divider
effect enhances the apparent voltage shift of the negative differential
resistance with magnetic field, which inherently is on the scale of the Zeeman

metallic electrodes can have on transport through molecules, and highlight how
this coupling can be used to develop molecular spintronic applications.

similar features in the Beta Pictoris disk we propose that this wing-tilt
asymmetry traces either an outer planetesimal belt that is inclined with
respect to the disk midplane or radiation-pressure-driven dust blown out from a
yet unseen, inner belt which is inclined with respect to the disk midplane. The
misaligned inner or outer disk may be a result of interaction with a yet unseen
planet. Overall, the disk geometry resembles the nearby disk around Beta

problem, two processes numbered 0 and 1 can call two procedures: update and
Fscan. A parameter of the problem is a two- variable function $F(x_0,x_1)$.
Each process $p_i$ can assign values to variable $x_i$ by calling update(v)
with some data value v, and compute the value: $F(x_0,x_1)$ by executing an
Fscan procedure. The problem is interesting when the domain of $F$ is infinite
and the range of $F$ is finite. In this case, some ""access restrictions"" are
imposed that limit the size of the registers that the Fscan procedure can
access. Aguilera et al. provided a non-blocking solution and asked whether a
wait-free solution exists. A positive answer can be found in [7].
  The natural generalization of the two-process signaling problem to an
arbitrary number of processes turns out to yield an interesting generalization
of the fundamental snapshot problem, which we call the F-snapshot problem. In
this problem $n$ processes can write values to an $n$-segment array (each
process to its own segment), and can read and obtain the value of an n-variable
function $F$ on the array of segments. In case that the range of $F$ is finite,
it is required that only bounded registers are accessed when the processes
apply the function $F$ to the array, although the data values written to the
segments may be taken from an infinite set. We provide here an affirmative
answer to the question of Aguilera et al. for an arbitrary number of processes.
Our solution employs only single-writer atomic registers, and its time
complexity is $O(n \log n)$, which is also the time complexity of the fastest
snapshot algorithm that uses only single-writer registers.

in a form of a stream, have wide applications such as cyber security, social
networks and transportation networks. This paper studies the problem of
summarizing graph streams. Specifically, given a graph stream G, directed or
undirected, the objective is to summarize G as S with much smaller (sublinear)
space, linear construction time and constant maintenance cost for each edge
update, such that S allows many queries over G to be approximately conducted
efficiently. Due to the sheer volume and highly dynamic nature of graph
streams, summarizing them remains a notoriously hard, if not impossible,
problem. The widely used practice of summarizing data streams is to treat each
element independently by e.g., hash- or sampling-based method, without keeping
track of the connections between elements in a data stream, which gives these
summaries limited power in supporting complicated queries over graph streams.
This paper discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for summarizing graph
streams. We present gLava, a probabilistic graph model that, instead of
treating an edge (a stream element) as the operating unit, uses the finer
grained node in an element. This will naturally form a new graph sketch where
edges capture the connections inside elements, and nodes maintain relationships
across elements. We discuss a wide range of supported graph queries and
establish theoretical error bounds for basic queries.

molecular zone (CMZ) with exceptionally large column densities and unusual
excitation properties compared to diffuse local clouds. The detection of the
(3,3) metastable level has been suggested to be the signature of warm and
diffuse gas in the CMZ. We use the Meudon PDR code to re-examine the
relationship between the column density of H3+ and the cosmic-ray ionization
rate, $\zeta$, up to large values of $\zeta$. We study the impact of the
various mechanisms that can excite H3+ in its metastable state. We produce
grids of PDR models exploring different parameters ($\zeta$, size of clouds,
metallicity) and infer the physical conditions that best match the observations
toward ten lines of sight in the CMZ. For one of them, Herschel observations of
HF, OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ can be used as additional constraints. We check that
the results found for H3+ also account for the observations of these molecules.
We find that the linear relationship between N(H3+) and $\zeta$ only holds up
to a certain value of the cosmic-ray ionization rate, which depends on the
proton density. A value $\zeta \sim 1 - 11 \times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ explains
both the large observed H3+ column density and its excitation in the metastable
level (3,3) in the CMZ. It also reproduces N(OH+), N(H2O+) and N(H3O+) detected
toward Sgr B2(N). We confirm that the CMZ probed by H3+ is diffuse, nH
$\lesssim$ 100 cm-3 and warm, T $\sim$ 212-505 K. This warm medium is due to
cosmic-ray heating. We also find that the diffuse component probed by H3+ must
fill a large fraction of the CMZ. Finally, we suggest the warm gas in the CMZ
enables efficient H2 formation via chemisorption sites as in PDRs. This
contributes to enhance the abundance of H3+ in this high cosmic-ray flux
environment.

equations which have many applications in physics and life sciences. The
largest difference between QDEs and ODEs is the algebraic structure. On the
non-commutativity of the quaternion algebra, the algebraic structure of the
solutions to the QDEs is completely different from ODEs. It is actually a left-
or right- free module, not a linear vector space.
  This paper establishes a systematic frame work for the theory of linear QDEs,
which can be applied to quantum mechanics, fluid mechanics, Frenet frame in
differential geometry, kinematic modelling, attitude dynamics, Kalman filter
design and spatial rigid body dynamics, etc. We prove that the algebraic
structure of the solutions to the QDEs is actually a left- or right- module,
not a linear vector space. On the non-commutativity of the quaternion algebra,
many concepts and properties for the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can
not be used. They should be redefined accordingly. A definition of Wronskian is
introduced under the framework of quaternions which is different from standard
one in the ordinary differential equations. Liouville formula for QDEs is
given. Also, it is necessary to treat the eigenvalue problems with left- and
right-sides, accordingly. Upon these, we studied the solutions to the linear
QDEs. Furthermore, we present two algorithms to evaluate the fundamental
matrix. Some concrete examples are given to show the feasibility of the
obtained algorithms. Finally, a conclusion and discussion ends the paper.

analysis of the large deviation principle (LDP) that characterizes the
likelihood and pathway of large fluctuations of the slow variables away from
their mean behavior -- such fluctuations are rare on short timescales but
become ubiquitous eventually. This LDP involves an Hamilton-Jacobi equation
whose Hamiltonian is related to the leading eigenvalue of the generator of the
fast process, and is typically non-quadratic in the momenta -- in other words,
the LDP for the slow variables in fast-slow systems is different in general
from that of any stochastic differential equation (SDE) one would write for the
slow variables alone. It is shown here that the eigenvalue problem for the
Hamiltonian can be reduced to a simpler algebraic equation for this Hamiltonian
for a specific class of systems in which the fast variables satisfy a linear
equation whose coefficients depend nonlinearly on the slow variables, and the
fast variables enter quadratically the equation for the slow variables. These
results are illustrated via examples, inspired by kinetic theories of turbulent
flows and plasma, in which the quasipotential characterizing the long time
behavior of the system is calculated and shown again to be different from that
of an SDE.

written as a scale mixture of normals, which makes them particularly easy to
implement. We propose general conditions on the prior on the local variance in
scale mixtures of normals, such that posterior contraction at the minimax rate
is assured. The conditions require tails at least as heavy as Laplace, but not
too heavy, and a large amount of mass around zero relative to the tails, more
so as the sparsity increases. These conditions give some general guidelines for
choosing a shrinkage prior for estimation under a nearly black sparsity
assumption. We verify these conditions for the class of priors considered by
Ghosh and Chakrabarti (2015), which includes the horseshoe and the
normal-exponential gamma priors, and for the horseshoe+, the inverse-Gaussian
prior, the normal-gamma prior, and the spike-and-slab Lasso, and thus extend
the number of shrinkage priors which are known to lead to posterior contraction

the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions
while allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution. The
implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3,
partially split forward Euler, forward-backward). It is demonstrated that using
an explicit partially split scheme for the coarse integrator allows to avoid
the use of an implicit scheme while still achieving speedup.

hole accretion physics proceed in a mass-invariant way. One of the best
examples of this scaling is the empirical ""Fundamental Plane of Black Hole
Accretion"" relation linking mass, radio and X-ray luminosity over eight orders
of magnitude in black hole mass. The currently favored theoretical
interpretation of this relation is that the physics governing power output in
weakly accreting black holes depends more on relative accretion rate than on
mass. In order to test this theory, we explore whether a mass-invariant
approach can simultaneously explain the broadband spectral energy distributions
from two black holes at opposite ends of the mass scale but at similar
Eddington accretion fractions. We find that the same model, with the same value
of several fitted physical parameters expressed in mass-scaling units to
enforce self-similarity, can provide a good description of two datasets from
V404 Cyg and M81*, a stellar and supermassive black hole, respectively.
Furthermore, only one of several potential emission scenarios for the X-ray
band is successful, suggesting it is the dominant process driving the
Fundamental Plane relation at this accretion rate. This approach thus holds
promise for breaking current degeneracies in the interpretation of black hole
high-energy spectra, and for constructing better prescriptions of black hole
accretion for use in various local and cosmological feedback applications.

representation, the reacting system is thus classified as a set of geometrical
bodies (spheres) where each and every one reaction interface is represented by
similar and smooth characteristics of reaction curve. It brings an unsolved
question whether the sharp and even boundary factually exists or if it resides
jointly just inside the global whole of the sample entirety preventing
individual particles from having their individual reaction front. Most of the
derived expressions are specified in an averaged generalization in terms of the
three and two parameters equation (so called JMAK and SB models) characterized

As an alternative the logistic equation is proposed powered with fractal

principle of defects. Unfortunately, many of the solutions for the standard
kinetic equations are truncated by infinite series, unfriendly to mathematical
solutions. Based on the assumption that transformation rate is a product of two

that of a circular annulus where the stationary fluxon speed merely is
determined by the system losses. The interaction between the vortex magnetic
moment and a spatially homogeneous in-plane magnetic field gives rise to a
tunable periodic non-sinusoidal potential which is strongly dependent on the

sensor nodes in a sensor network. In the considered scenario, multiple acoustic
sensor nodes within communication range of a cluster head are grouped into
clusters. Acoustic sensor nodes in a cluster detect acoustic signals and
convert them into electric signals (packets). Detection by acoustic sensors can
be executed periodically or randomly and random detection by acoustic sensors
is event driven. As a result, each acoustic sensor generates their packets
(50bytes each) periodically or randomly over short time intervals
(400ms~4seconds) and transmits directly to a cluster head (coordinator node).
Our approach proposes to use a slotted carrier sense multiple access. All
acoustic sensor nodes in a cluster are allocated to time slots and the number
of allocated sensor nodes to each time slot is uniform. All sensor nodes
allocated to a time slot listen for packet transmission from the beginning of
the time slot for a duration proportional to their priority. The first node
that detect the channel to be free for its whole window is allowed to transmit.
The order of packet transmissions with the acoustic sensor nodes in the time
slot is autonomously adjusted according to the history of packet transmissions
in the time slot. In simulations, performances of the proposed scheme are
demonstrated by the comparisons with other low rate wireless channel access
schemes.

This leads to a partitioning of the state space of a system into regions of
macroscopically indistinguishable micro-states. The largest of these regions is
singled out as the equilibrium region of the system. What justifies this
association? We review currently available answers to this question and find
them wanting both for conceptual and for technical reasons. We propose a new
conception of equilibrium and prove a mathematical theorem which establishes in
full generality -- i.e. without making any assumptions about the system's
dynamics or the nature of the interactions between its components -- that the
equilibrium macro-region is the largest macro-region. We then turn to the
question of the approach to equilibrium, of which there exists no satisfactory
general answer so far. In our account, this question is replaced by the
question when an equilibrium state exists. We prove another -- again fully
general -- theorem providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of an equilibrium state. This theorem changes the way in which the
question of the approach to equilibrium should be discussed: rather than
launching a search for a crucial factor (such as ergodicity or typicality), the
focus should be on finding triplets of macro-variables, dynamical conditions,
and effective state spaces that satisfy the conditions of the theorem.

effects which, in turn, impose wide-ranging negative constraints on emotional
well being and neurocognitive performance (Kalueff:2007cp, Charles:2013eq,
Nadler:2010hk). Crucial cognitive functions such as memory and problem solving,
as well more short term emotional responses (e.g., anticipation of- and
response to- monetary rewards or losses) are influenced by mood. The negative
impact of these behavioural responses is felt at the individual level, but it
also imposes major economic burden on modern healthcare systems. Although much
research have been undertaken to understand the underlying mechanisms of
depressed mood and design efficient treatment pathways, comparatively little
was done to characterize mood modulations that remain within the boundaries of
a healthy mental functioning. In one placebo-controlled experiments, we applied
daily prefrontal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) at five points
in time, and found reliable improvements on self-reported mood evaluation. We
replicated this finding in an independent double-blinded placebo-controlled
experiment and showed that stimulation over a shorter period of time (3 days)
is sufficient to create detectable mood improvements. Taken together, our data
show that repeated bilateral prefrontal tDCS can reduce psychological distress
in nondepressed individuals.

increasing altitude, moving in the retrograde direction and slightly poleward
with increasing altitude. We also see a faint 'tail' of more reflective

using either two main cloud layers of a 5-layer aerosol model based on
Sromovsky et al. (2011) or by the simpler two-cloud-layer model of Tice et al.
(2013). The deep component appears to be due to an increase in reflectivity and
altitude of the main tropospheric cloud deck at 2 - 3 bars for both models,

thickening of the tropospheric haze of the 2-layer model or a vertical
extension of the upper tropospheric cloud of the 5-layer model, assumed to be

a black hole mass upper limit of 9.12e4 solar masses, assuming that the ULX is

Adding interactions the question arises whether the condensate is stable. For
repulsive interaction the answer is positive with regard to the ground-state,
but what about a condensation in an excited mode? We discuss some results that
have been obtained for a 2-mode bosonic Josephson junction, and for a 3-mode
minimal-model of a superfluid circuit. Additionally we mention the possibility
to stabilize an unstable condensate by introducing periodic or noisy driving
into the system: this is due to the Kapitza and the Zeno effects.

angular size astronomical radio sources via the distortive effects of spatially
and temporally varying electron density associated with outflows from the Sun.
These radio sources are a potential foreground contaminant signal for
redshifted HI emission from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) because they yield
time-dependent flux density variations in bright extragalactic point sources.
Contamination from foreground continuum sources complicates efforts to
discriminate the cosmological signal from other sources in the sky. In IPS, at
large angles from the Sun applicable to EoR observations, weak scattering
induces spatially and temporally correlated fluctuations in the measured flux
density of sources in the field, potentially affecting the detectability of the
EoR signal by inducing non-static variations in the signal strength. In this
work, we explore the impact of interplanetary weak scintillation on EoR power
spectrum measurements, accounting for the instrumental spatial and temporal
sampling. We use published power spectra of electron density fluctuations and
parameters of EoR experiments to derive the IPS power spectrum in the
wavenumber phase space of EoR power spectrum measurements. The contrast of IPS
power to expected cosmological power is used as a metric to assess the impact
of IPS. We show that IPS has a different spectral structure to power from
foregrounds alone, but the additional leakage into the EoR observation
parameter space is negligible under typical IPS conditions, unless data are
used from deep within the foreground contamination region.

and proplyd-like objects near the Galactic centre, we analyse the effect of a
potential outflow from the centre on bow shock properties. We show that due to
the non-negligible isotropic central outflow the bow-shock evolution along the
orbit becomes asymmetric between the pre-peribothron and post-peribothron
phases. This is demonstrated by the calculation of the bow-shock size
evolution, the velocity along the shocked layer, the surface density of the
bow-shock, and by emission-measure maps close to the peribothron passage.
Within the ambient velocity range of $\lesssim 2000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ the
asymmetry is profound and the changes are considerable for different outflow
velocities. As a case study we perform model calculations for the Dusty
S-cluster Object (DSO/G2) as a potential young stellar object that is currently
being monitored and has passed the pericentre at $\sim 2000$ Schwarzschild
radii from the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) in 2014. We show that the
velocity field of the shocked layer can contribute to the observed increasing
line width of the DSO source up to the peribothron. Subsequently, supposing
that the line emission originates in the bow shock, a decrease of the line
width is expected. Furthermore, the decline of the bow-shock emission measure
in the post-peribothron phase could help to reveal the emission of the putative
star. The dominant contribution of circumstellar matter (either inflow or
outflow) is consistent with the observed stable luminosity and compactness of
the DSO/G2 source during its pericentre passage.

These indicate strong spin-phonon coupling in SrFeO2 in contrast to that in

also been performed at temperatures from 5 K to 353 K in the antiferromagnetic
phase and analyzed using the ab-initio calculations. These suggest distortion
of the ideal infinite planer structure above 300 K. From our ab-initio
calculations in SrFeO2 as a function of volume, we suggest that the distortion
in SrFeO2 above 300 K is similar to that known in CaFeO2 at ambient conditions.
The distortion of the planer structure of CaFeO2 involves doubling of the
planer unit cell that may be usually expected to be due to a soft phonon mode
at the M-point (1/2 1/2 0). However, our ab-initio calculations show quite
unusually that all the M-point (1/2 1/2 0) phonons are stable, but two stable
M3+ and M2-modes anharmonically couple with an unstable Bu mode at the zone
centre and lead to the cell doubling and the distorted structure. Magnetic
exchange interactions in both the compounds have been computed on the basis of
the ideal planar structure (P4/mmm space group) and with increasing amplitude
of the Bu phonon mode. These reveal that the magnetic exchange interactions
reduce significantly with increasing distortion. We have extended the ab-initio
phonon calculation to high pressures, which reveal that, above 20 GPa of
pressure, the undistorted planer CaFeO2 becomes dynamically stable. We also
report computed phonon spectra in SrFeO3 that has a cubic structure, which is
useful to understand the role of the difference in geometry of oxygen atoms

The local
state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is encoded in the spectrum of a
background source (radio-loud quasars or gamma ray burst afterglow) by
absorption at the local 21-cm wavelength, resulting in a continuous and
fluctuating absorption level. Small-scale structures (filaments and minihaloes)
in the IGM are responsible for the strongest absorption features. The
absorption can also be modulated on large scales by inhomogeneous heating and
Wouthuysen-Field coupling.
  We present the results from a simulation that attempts to preserve the
cosmological environment while resolving some of the small-scale structures (a
few kpc resolution in a 50 Mpc/h box). The simulation couples the dynamics and
the ionizing radiative transfer and includes X-ray and Lyman lines radiative
transfer for a detailed physical modelling. As a result we find that soft X-ray
self-shielding, Lyman-alpha self-shielding and shock heating all have an impact
on the predicted values of the 21-cm optical depth of moderately overdense
structures like filaments. An correct treatment of the peculiar velocities is
also critical. Modelling these processes seems necessary for accurate
predictions and can be done only at high enough resolution. As a result, based
on our fiducial model, we estimate that LOFAR should be able to detect a few
(strong) absorptions features in a frequency range of a few tens of MHz for a
20 mJy source located at z=10, while the SKA would extract a large fraction of
the absorption information for the same source.

Psychol. 6 (2015) 01538",,,"physics.soc-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the psychological effect of preference reversal and show that it
finds a natural explanation in the frame of quantum decision theory. When
people choose between lotteries with non-negative payoffs, they prefer a more
certain lottery because of uncertainty aversion. But when people evaluate
lottery prices, e.g. for selling to others the right to play them, they do this
more rationally, being less subject to behavioral biases. This difference can
be explained by the presence of the attraction factors entering the expression
of quantum probabilities. Only the existence of attraction factors can explain
why, considering two lotteries with close utility factors, a decision maker
prefers one of them when choosing, but evaluates higher the other one when
pricing. We derive a general quantitative criterion for the preference reversal
to occur that relates the utilities of the two lotteries to the attraction
factors under choosing versus pricing and test successfully its application on
experiments by Tversky et al. We also show that the planning paradox can be
treated as a kind of preference reversal.

shallow water wave data and it is shown that the fitted model is able to
reproduce important statistics of the data such as its spectrum and marginal

that allows for a seamless transition from the traditional static scenario to a
arbitrary loading conditions, including inertia effects and body forces. The
strategy is formulated in the spirit of computational homogenization methods
(FE$^2$) and is based on the discrete version of Hill's averaging results
recently derived by the authors. In particular, the traditional static
multiscale scheme is proved here to be equivalent to a direct homogenization of
the principle of minimum potential energy and to hold exactly under a finite
element discretization. This perspective provides a unifying variational
framework for the FE$^2$ method, in the static setting, with Dirichlet or
Neumann boundary conditions on the representative volume element; and it
directly manifests the approximate duality of the effective strain energy
density obtained with these two types of boundary conditions in the sense of
Legendre transformation. Its generalization to arbitrary loading conditions and
material constitutive relations is then immediate through the incremental
minimum formulation of the dynamic problem \`a la Radovitzky and Ortiz (1999),
which, in the discrete setting, is in full analogy to the static problem. These
theoretical developments are then translated into an efficient multiscale
FE$^2$ computational strategy for the homogenization of a microscopic explicit
dynamics scheme, with two noteworthy properties. Firstly, each time incremental
problem can be solved exactly with a single Newton-Raphson iteration with a
constant Hessian, regardless of the specific non-linearities or
history-dependence of the micro-constituents' behavior. Secondly, the scheme
concurrently solves for the microscopic and macroscopic degrees of freedom, in
contrast to standard approaches based on sequential or nested minimizations.

parton-to-pion fragmentation functions from the recent DSS14 global analysis,
which prefer a smaller gluon-to-pion fragmentation function. The
$\pi^{0}A_{LL}$ results follow an increasingly positive asymmetry trend with
$p_T$ and $\sqrt{s}$ with respect to the predictions and are in excellent
agreement with the latest global analysis results. This analysis incorporated
earlier results on $\pi^0$ and jet $A_{LL}$, and suggested a positive
contribution of gluon polarization to the spin of the proton $\Delta G$ for the
gluon momentum fraction range $x>0.05$. The data presented here extend to a
currently unexplored region, down to $x\sim0.01$, and thus provide additional
constraints on the value of $\Delta G$. The results confirm the evidence for
nonzero $\Delta G$ using a different production channel in a complementary
kinematic region.

artificially generated self-propelled droplets. Here, we analyze deformable
bead-spring microswimmers in an externally imposed solvent flow field as simple
theoretical model systems. We focus on their behavior in a circular swirl flow
in two spatial dimensions. Linear (straight) two-bead swimmers are found to
circle around the swirl with a slight drift to the outside with increasing
activity. In contrast to that, we observe for triangular three-bead or
square-like four-bead swimmers a tendency of being drawn into the swirl and
finally getting drowned, although a radial inward component is absent in the
flow field. During one cycle around the swirl, the self-propulsion direction of
an active triangular or square-like swimmer remains almost constant, while
their orbits become deformed exhibiting an ``egg-like'' shape. Over time, the
swirl flow induces slight net rotations of these swimmer types, which leads to
net rotations of the egg-shaped orbits. Interestingly, in certain cases, the
orbital rotation changes sense when the swimmer approaches the flow
singularity. Our predictions can be verified in real-space experiments on
artificial microswimmers.

  Here, we extend the model introduced by Menezes et al (2009) to consider the
effect of not just copy number, but also of other molecular profiles such as
methylation changes and loss-of-heterozigosity (LOH), on gene expression
levels. We will consider again sets of measurements, to improve robustness of
results and increase the power to find associations. Our approach can be used
genome-wide to find associations, yields a test to help separate true
associations from noise and can include confounders.

genome-wide copy number, methylation and gene expression profiles are
available. Our findings include interesting gene expression-regulating
mechanisms, which may involve only one of copy number or methylation, or both
for the same samples. We even are able to find effects due to different
molecular mechanisms in different samples.

quantum optics. In this realistic condensed matter device, single electrons are
injected and travel along opposite chiral edge states of the integer quantum
Hall effect, colliding at a quantum point contact (QPC). We monitor the fate of
the colliding excitations by calculating zero-frequency current correlations at
the output of the QPC. In the simpler case of filling factor $\nu=1$, we
recover the standard result of a dip in the current noise as a function of the
time delay between electron injections. For simultaneous injection, the current
correlations exactly vanish, as dictated by the Pauli principle. This picture
is however dramatically modified when interactions are present, as we show in
the case of a filling factor $\nu=2$. There, each edge state is made out of two
co-propagating channels, leading to charge fractionalization, and ultimately to
decoherence. The latter phenomenon reduces the degree of indistinguishability
between the two electron wavepackets, yielding a reduced contrast in the HOM
signal. This naturally brings about the question of stronger interaction,
offering a natural extension of the present work to the case of fractional
quantum Hall effect where many open and fascinating questions remain.

These processes provide theoretically clean windows into physics beyond the

outside the charmonium resonance region are 1-2$\sigma$ higher than the LHCb

data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events
such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be
misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions
have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes.
Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies
might arise. Such ""process-agnostic"" approaches typically infer a tree for each
locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree
distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context
of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model
selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable
number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is
poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of
phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common
evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are
distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or
Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal
number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette
criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the
approach by (i) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast
species and (ii) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced
loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta. We release treeCl, a new

interactions; and (2) the proof of convergence for three different orders in
which the individuals are updated (updating schemes). Finally, computer
simulations are explored in two-dimensional lattices with the purpose to
recover the main features of the Naming Game and to describe the dynamics under

following timelike trajectories in stationary spacetimes are introduced and
analyzed systematically. These definitions are based on the $1+3$ (threading)
and $3+1$ (slicing) spacetime decomposition formalisms and defined relative to
two different sets of observers. After showing that Synge's definition of
spatial distance and 3-velocity are equivalent to those defined in the $1+3$
(threading) formalism, we exemplify differences between the two definitions, by
calculating them for particles in circular orbits in axially symmetric
stationary spacetimes. Illustrating its geometric nature, the relative linear
velocity between the corresponding observers is obtained in terms of the
spacetime metric components. Circular particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime, as
the prototype and the most well known of stationary spacetimes, are examined
with respect to these definitions to highlight their observer-dependent nature.
We also examine the Kerr-NUT spacetime in which the NUT parameter contributing
to the off-diagonal terms in the metric is mainly interpreted not as a rotation
parameter but as a gravitomagnetic monopole charge. Finally, in a specific
astrophysical setup which includes rotating black holes, it is shown how these
local definitions are related to the velocity measurements made by distant
observers using spectral line shifts.

high-order interactions are almost always built by modelling responses of a

implicitly by the filter coefficients. In contrast, we learn an explicit
high-order MGRF structure by considering the learning process in terms of
general exponential family distributions nested over base models, so that
potentials added later can build on previous ones. We relatively rapidly add
new features by skipping over the costly optimisation of parameters.
  We introduce the use of local binary patterns as features in MGRF texture
models, and generalise them by learning offsets to the surrounding pixels.
These prove effective as high-order features, and are fast to compute. Several
schemes for selecting high-order features by composition or search of a small
subclass are compared. Additionally we present a simple modification of the
maximum likelihood as a texture modelling-specific objective function which
aims to improve generalisation by local windowing of statistics.
  The proposed method was experimentally evaluated by learning high-order MGRF
models for a broad selection of complex textures and then performing texture
synthesis, and succeeded on much of the continuum from stochastic through
irregularly structured to near-regular textures. Learning interaction structure
is very beneficial for textures with large-scale structure, although those with
complex irregular structure still provide difficulties. The texture models were
also quantitatively evaluated on two tasks and found to be competitive with
other works: grading of synthesised textures by a panel of observers; and
comparison against several recent MGRF models by evaluation on a constrained
inpainting task.

scalar parameter (the target signal) in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where
each sensor receives a single snapshot of the field. We assume that the
observation at each node randomly falls into one of two modes: a valid or an
invalid observation mode. Specifically, mode one corresponds to the desired
signal plus noise observation mode (\emph{valid}), and mode two corresponds to
the pure noise mode (\emph{invalid}) due to node defect or damage. With no
prior information on such local sensing modes, we introduce a learning-based
distributed procedure, called the mixed detection-estimation (MDE) algorithm,
based on iterative closed-loop interactions between mode learning (detection)
and target estimation. The online learning step re-assesses the validity of the
local observations at each iteration, thus refining the ongoing estimation
update process. The convergence of the MDE algorithm is established
analytically. Asymptotic analysis shows that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime, the MDE estimation error converges to that of an ideal
(centralized) estimator with perfect information about the node sensing modes.
This is in contrast to the estimation performance of a naive average consensus
based distributed estimator (without mode learning), whose estimation error
blows up with an increasing SNR.

unfair, discriminatory, or offensive user treatment in data-driven
applications. The UA framework unifies and rationalizes a number of prior
attempts at formalizing algorithmic fairness. It uniquely combines multiple
investigative primitives and fairness metrics with broad applicability,
granular exploration of unfair treatment in user subgroups, and incorporation
of natural notions of utility that may account for observed disparities. We
instantiate the UA framework in FairTest, the first comprehensive tool that
helps developers check data-driven applications for unfair user treatment. It
enables scalable and statistically rigorous investigation of associations
between application outcomes (such as prices or premiums) and sensitive user
attributes (such as race or gender). Furthermore, FairTest provides debugging
capabilities that let programmers rule out potential confounders for observed
unfair effects. We report on use of FairTest to investigate and in some cases
address disparate impact, offensive labeling, and uneven rates of algorithmic
error in four data-driven applications. As examples, our results reveal subtle
biases against older populations in the distribution of error in a predictive

evolution, and the one-loop matching conditions at the electroweak scale. By
requiring the stability of the potential up to the Planck mass, significant
constraints on the masses of the heavy neutrinos, on the gauge couplings and
the mixing in the Higgs sector are identified.
