infrared galaxies identified with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) satellite. The majority of them is at high redshifts (z~2-3), at the
peak epoch of star formation in the Universe. Infrared, optical, radio, and
X-ray data suggest that hot DOGs contain heavily obscured, extremely luminous
active galactic nuclei (AGN). This class may represent a short phase in the
life of the galaxies, signifying the transition from starburst- to
AGN-dominated phases. Hot DOGs are typically radio-quiet, but some of them show
mJy-level emission in the radio (microwave) band. We observed four hot DOGs
using the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The 1.7-GHz
observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) revealed weak radio features
in all sources. The radio is free from dust obscuration and, at such high
redshifts, VLBI is sensitive only to compact structures that are characteristic
of AGN activity. In two cases (WISE J0757+5113, WISE J1603+2745), the flux
density of the VLBI-detected components is much smaller than the total flux
density, suggesting that ~70-90 per cent of the radio emission, while still
dominated by AGN, originates from angular scales larger than probed by the EVN.
The source WISE J1146+4129 appears a candidate compact symmetric object, and
WISE J1814+3412 shows a 5.1-kpc double structure, reminiscent of hot spots in a
medium-sized symmetric object. Our observations support that AGN residing in
hot DOGs may be genuine young radio sources where starburst and AGN activities
coexist.

opportunity to describe essences of objects more precisely, using their

proposes universal constructor of multisets of objects that gives us a
possibility to create arbitrary multisets of objects. In addition, a few
determined constructors of multisets of objects, which allow creating
multisets, using strictly defined schemas, also are proposed in the paper. Such

neural networks. A challenge in machine learning is to create models that
generalize to new data samples not seen in the training data. Recently, a
common flaw in several machine learning algorithms was discovered: small
perturbations added to the input data lead to consistent misclassification of
data samples. Samples that easily mislead the model are called adversarial
examples. Training a ""maxout"" network on adversarial examples has shown to
decrease this vulnerability, but also increase classification performance. This
paper shows that adversarial training has a regularizing effect also in
networks with logistic, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. A simple
extension to the back-propagation method is proposed, that adds an adversarial
gradient to the training. The extension requires an additional forward and
backward pass to calculate a modified input sample, or mini batch, used as
input for standard back-propagation learning. The first experimental results on
MNIST show that the ""adversarial back-propagation"" method increases the
resistance to adversarial examples and boosts the classification performance.
The extension reduces the classification error on the permutation invariant
MNIST from 1.60% to 0.95% in a logistic network, and from 1.40% to 0.78% in a
network with rectified linear units. Results on CIFAR-10 indicate that the
method has a regularizing effect similar to dropout in fully connected
networks. Based on these promising results, adversarial back-propagation is
proposed as a stand-alone regularizing method that should be further
investigated.

  In this paper we advance the theory of such inequalities for torsion-free

forward it is crucial to investigate the accretion disk physics near various
types of inner compact objects now to deduce later constraints on the central
objects from observations. A possible candidate for the inner object is the
boson star. Here, we will try to analyze the differences between accretion
structures surrounding boson stars and black holes. We aim at analysing the
physics of circular geodesics around boson stars and study simple thick
accretion tori (so-called Polish doughnuts) in the vicinity of these stars. We
realize a detailed study of the properties of circular geodesics around boson
stars. We then perform a parameter study of thick tori with constant angular
momentum surrounding boson stars. This is done using the boson star models
computed by a code constructed with the spectral solver library KADATH. We
demonstrate that all the circular stable orbits are bound. In the case of a
constant angular momentum torus, a cusp in the torus surface exists only for
boson stars with a strong gravitational scalar field. Moreover, for each inner
radius of the disk, the allowed specific angular momentum values lie within a
constrained range which depends on the boson star considered. We show that the
accretion tori around boson stars have different characteristics than in the
vicinity of a black hole. With future instruments it could be possible to use
these differences to constrain the nature of compact objects.

Comptonization. HEROIC models Comptonization via the Kompaneets equation, using
a quadratic approximation for the source function in the short characteristics
radiation solver. It employs a simple form of accelerated lambda iteration to
handle regions of high scattering opacity. In addition to solving for the
radiation field, HEROIC also solves for the gas temperature by applying the
condition of radiative equilibrium. We present benchmarks and tests of the
Comptonization module in HEROIC with simple 1D and 3D scattering problems. We
also test the ability of the code to handle various relativistic effects using
model atmospheres and accretion flows in a black hole space-time. We present
two applications of HEROIC to general relativistic MHD simulations of accretion
discs. One application is to a thin accretion disc around a black hole. We find
that the gas below the photosphere in the multi-dimensional HEROIC solution is
nearly isothermal, quite different from previous solutions based on 1D plane
parallel atmospheres. The second application is to a geometrically thick
radiation-dominated accretion disc accreting at 11 times the Eddington rate.
The multi-dimensional HEROIC solution shows that, for observers who are on axis
and look down the polar funnel, the isotropic equivalent luminosity could be
more than ten times the Eddington limit, even though the spectrum might still
look thermal and show no signs of relativistic beaming.

particle acceleration behaviours are recovered, which affect both electrons and
protons: (i) direct acceleration along field lines and (ii) tangential drifting
of guiding centres with respect to local magnetic field. However, up to 40\% of
all particles actually experience a form of (high energy) particle trap,
because of changes in the direction of the electric field and unrelated to the
strength of the magnetic field; such particles are included in the first
category. Additionally, category (i) electron and proton orbits undergo
surprisingly strong acceleration to non-thermal energies ($\lesssim42$MeV),
because of the strength and extent of super-Dreicer electric fields created by
the MHD simulation. Reducing the electric field strength of the MHD model does
not significantly affect the efficiency of the (electric field-based) trapping
mechanism, but does reduce the peak energies gained by orbits. We discuss the
implications for future experiments, which aim to simulate non-flaring active

for example) and because its low power consumption makes it suitable to be
embedded in smaller wearable devices, such as fitness trackers. 30 subjects
from two different organizations were provided with smartphones. The study
lasted for 8 weeks and was conducted in real working environments, with no
constraints whatsoever placed upon smartphone usage. The subjects reported
their perceived stress levels three times during their working hours. Using
combination of statistical models to classify self reported stress levels, we
achieved a maximum overall accuracy of 71% for user-specific models and an
accuracy of 60% for the use of similar-users models, relying solely on data
from a single accelerometer.

modeling step of conventional computing altogether. Data-driven solvers seek to
assign to each material point the state from a prespecified data set that is
closest to satisfying the conservation laws. Equivalently, data-driven solvers
aim to find the state satisfying the conservation laws that is closest to the
data set. The resulting data-driven problem thus consists of the minimization
of a distance function to the data set in phase space subject to constraints
introduced by the conservation laws. We motivate the data-driven paradigm and
investigate the performance of data-driven solvers by means of two examples of
application, namely, the static equilibrium of nonlinear three-dimensional
trusses and linear elasticity. In these tests, the data-driven solvers exhibit
good convergence properties both with respect to the number of data points and
with regard to local data assignment. The variational structure of the
data-driven problem also renders it amenable to analysis. We show that, as the
data set approximates increasingly closely a classical material law in phase
space, the data-driven solutions converge to the classical solution. We also
illustrate the robustness of data-driven solvers with respect to spatial
discretization. In particular, we show that the data-driven solutions of
finite-element discretizations of linear elasticity converge jointly with
respect to mesh size and approximation by the data set.

electronic excitation processes which is not obtainable from local
visualization methods such as transition densities, density differences, or
natural transition orbitals. The PHM is defined as a nonlocal function of two
spatial variables and provides information about the origins, destinations, and
connections of charge fluctuations during an excitation process; it is
particularly valuable to analyze charge-transfer excitonic processes. In
contrast with the transition density matrix, the PHM has a statistical
interpretation involving joint probabilities of individual states and their
transitions, it satisfies several sum rules and exact conditions, and it is
easier to read and interpret. We discuss and illustrate the properties of the
PHM and give several examples and applications to excitations in
one-dimensional model systems, in a hydrogen chain, and in a benzothiadiazole

For Galactic molecular cloud structures, we show that the characteristic volume

complementary to other available algorithms. Using 12CO(1-0) data for the

where angular momentum transport is driven by the mixing of a radial magnetic
field into the disk from a T-Tauri wind. Because the radial profile of the
imposed magnetic field is well constrained, a deterministic calculation of the
disk mass flow becomes possible. The vertical disk profiles obtained in Paper I
imply a stronger magnetization in the inner disk, faster accretion, and a
secular depletion of the disk material. Inward transport of solids allows the
disk to maintain a broad optical absorption layer even when the grain abundance
becomes too small to suppress its ionization. Thus a PPD may show a strong
middle-to-near infrared spectral excess even while its mass profile departs
radically from the minimum-mass solar nebula. The disk surface density is
buffered at $\sim 30$ g cm$^{-2}$: below this, X-rays trigger strong enough
magnetorotational turbulence at the midplane to loft mm-cm sized particles high
in the disk, followed by catastrophic fragmentation. A sharp density gradient
bounds the inner depleted disk, and propagates outward to $\sim 1$-2 AU over a
few Myr. Earth-mass planets migrate through the inner disk over a similar
timescale, whereas the migration of Jupiters is limited by the supply of gas.
Gas-mediated migration must stall outside 0.04 AU, where silicates are
sublimated and the disk shifts to a much lower column. A transition disk
emerges when the dust/gas ratio in the MRI-active layer falls below $X_d \sim
10^{-6}(a_d/\mu{\rm m})$, where $a_d$ is the grain size.

radial magnetic field. Our focus is on protoplanetary disks (PPDs), which are
exposed during their later evolution to an intense, magnetized wind from the
central star. A radial magnetic field is mixed into a thin surface layer, is
wound up by the disk shear, and is pushed downward by a combination of
turbulent mixing and ambipolar and Ohmic drift. The toroidal field reaches much
greater strengths than the seed vertical field that is usually invoked in PPD
models, even becoming superthermal. Linear stability analysis indicates that
the disk experiences the magnetorotational instability (MRI) at a higher
magnetization than a vertically magnetized disk when both the effects of
ambipolar and Hall drift are taken into account. Steady vertical profiles of
density and magnetic field are obtained at several radii between 0.06 and 1 AU
in response to a wind magnetic field $B_r \sim (10^{-4}$-$10^{-2})(r/{\rm
AU})^{-2}$ G. Careful attention is given to the radial and vertical ionization
structure resulting from irradiation by stellar X-rays. The disk is more
strongly magnetized closer to the star, where it can support a higher rate of
mass transfer. As a result, the inner $\sim 1$ AU of a PPD is found to evolve
toward lower surface density. Mass transfer rates around $10^{-8}\,M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ are obtained under conservative assumptions about the MRI-generated
stress. The evolution of the disk, and the implications for planet migration,
are investigated in the accompanying paper.

in particular in 2D systems due to increased stability resulting from reduced

Here, we use the most general form of the 2D free energy with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions constructed from general symmetry
considerations reflecting the underlying system. We predict that skyrmion phase
is robust and it is present even when the system lacks the in-plane rotational
symmetry. In fact, the lowered symmetry leads to increased stability of
vortex-antivortex lattices with four-fold symmetry and in-plane spirals, in
some instances even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results
relate different hexagonal and square cell phases to the symmetries of
materials used for realizations of skyrmions. This will give clear directions
for experimental realizations of hexagonal and square cell phases, and will
allow engineering of skyrmions with unusual properties. We also predict
striking differences in gyro-dynamics induced by spin currents for isolated
skyrmions and for crystals where spin currents can be induced by charge
carriers or by thermal magnons. We find that under certain conditions, isolated
skyrmions can move along the current without a side motion which can have
implications for realizations of magnetic memories.

causations, encouraging mistrust, rumors, and even conspiracy thinking. In
order to contrast such a trend attempts to \textit{debunk} are often
undertaken. Here, we examine the effectiveness of debunking through a
quantitative analysis of 54 million users over a time span of five years (Jan
2010, Dec 2014). In particular, we compare how users interact with proven
(scientific) and unsubstantiated (conspiracy-like) information on Facebook in
the US. Our findings confirm the existence of echo chambers where users
interact primarily with either conspiracy-like or scientific pages. Both groups
interact similarly with the information within their echo chamber. We examine
47,780 debunking posts and find that attempts at debunking are largely
ineffective. For one, only a small fraction of usual consumers of
unsubstantiated information interact with the posts. Furthermore, we show that
those few are often the most committed conspiracy users and rather than
internalizing debunking information, they often react to it negatively. Indeed,
after interacting with debunking posts, users retain, or even increase, their
engagement within the conspiracy echo chamber.

'FR0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio emission. A

requirements for a FR0 classification. Hence, the emerging FR0 population

The external magnetic field controls spin frustration in the system and induces
non-collinearity of the spin structure, which is essential for the two-magnon
decay processes. Our results include an intriguing field-evolution of the
regions of the Brillouin zone wherein decays of spin excitations are prominent,
a detailed classification of the decay channels involving magnons from both

spectra due to coupling to the two magnon continuum, all of which are
illustrated for several field and anisotropy values. We highlight a number of

paradigm, the vast majority of stars rapidly form along with multiple close-in
planets in the mass range of Mars to super-Earths/mini-Neptunes. Such systems
of tightly-packed inner planets (STIPs) are metastable, with the time scale of
the dynamical instability having a major influence on final planet types. In
most cases, the planets consolidate into a system of fewer, more massive
planets, but long after the circumstellar gas disk has dissipated. This can
yield planets with masses above the traditional critical core of $\sim$10
$M_\oplus$, yielding short-period giants that lack abundant gas. A rich variety
of physical states are also possible given the range of collisional outcomes
and formation time of the close-in planets. However, when dynamical
consolidation occurs before gas dispersal, a critical core can form that then
grows via gas capture into a short-period gas giant. In this picture the
majority of Hot and Warm Jupiters formed locally, rather than migrating down
from larger distances.

hydrodynamics (SPH), include radiative cooling, star formation, metal
enrichment and supernova feedback, and can be split in two different groups,
depending on whether feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is turned on or
off. Simulations are analyzed to account for HI self-shielding and the presence
of molecular hydrogen. We find that the mass in neutral hydrogen of dark matter
halos monotonically increases with the halo mass and can be well described by a
power-law of the form $M_{\rm HI}(M,z)\propto M^{3/4}$. Our results point out
that AGN feedback reduces both the total halo mass and its HI mass, although it
is more efficient in removing HI. We conclude that AGN feedback reduces the
neutral hydrogen mass of a given halo by $\sim50\%$, with a weak dependence on
halo mass and redshift. The spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen within
halos is also affected by AGN feedback, whose effect is to decrease the
fraction of HI that resides in the halo inner regions. By extrapolating our
results to halos not resolved in our simulations we derive astrophysical
implications from the measurements of $\Omega_{\rm HI}(z)$: halos with circular
velocities larger than $\sim25~{\rm km/s}$ are needed to host HI in order to
reproduce observations. We find that only the model with AGN feedback is
capable of reproducing the value of $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}$ derived from

interaction the fermions are gapped both at the boundary of the SPT states and
at the bulk quantum phase transition, thus these models at low energy can be
described completely by bosonic degrees of freedom. We show that the bulk of
these models is described by a Sp($N$) principal chiral model with a
topological $\Theta$-term, whose boundary is described by a Sp($N$) principal
chiral model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term at level-1. The quantum phase
transition between SPT states in the bulk is tuned by a particular interaction
term, which corresponds to tuning $\Theta$ in the field theory, and the phase
transition occurs at $\Theta = \pi$. The simplest version of these models with
$N=1$ is equivalent to the familiar O(4) nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) with a
topological term, whose boundary is a $(1+1)d$ conformal field theory with
central charge $c = 1$. After breaking the O(4) symmetry to its subgroups, this
model can be viewed as bosonic SPT states with U(1), or $Z_2$ symmetries, etc.
All these fermion models including the bulk quantum phase transitions can be
simulated with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method without the sign problem.
Recent numerical results strongly suggests that the quantum disordered phase of
the O(4) NLSM with precisely $\Theta = \pi$ is a stable $(2+1)d$ conformal
field theory (CFT) with gapless bosonic modes.

increases the duration of reionisation and boosts the small-scale 21cm power by
~ 2-3 at intermediate phases of reionisation. Introducing inhomogeneous
recombinations reduces ionised bubble sizes and suppresses large-scale 21cm
power by ~ 2-3. Moreover, gas clumping on sub-cell scales has a minimal effect
on the 21cm power, indicating that robust predictions do not depend on the
behaviour of kpc-scale structures. The superlinear ionisations significantly
increase the median halo mass scale for ionising photon output to >10^10 Mo,
giving greater hope for detecting most of ionising sources with next-generation
facilities. These results highlight the importance of more accurately treating
ionising sources and recombinations for modeling reionisation and its 21cm

quantum critical behavior with highly degenerate excited states. We show that
though interactions are an irrelevant perturbation in the ground state, they
drastically affect the structure of excited states: even arbitrarily weak
interactions split the degeneracies in favor of thermalization (weak disorder)
or spontaneously broken particle-hole symmetry, driving the system into a
many-body localized spin glass phase (strong disorder). In both cases, the
quantum critical properties of the non-interacting model are destroyed, either
by thermal decoherence or spontaneous symmetry breaking. This system then has
the interesting and counterintuitive property that edges of the many-body

infall into the Norma cluster. With sensitive and spatially-resolved MUSE
spectroscopy, we analyse the emission line diagnostics in the tail of
ESO137-001, finding high values of [NII]/H$\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\alpha$ that are
suggestive of the presence of shocks in turbulent gas. However, the observed
line ratios are not as strong as commonly seen in pure shock heating models,
suggesting that other emission mechanisms may contribute to the observed
emission. Indeed, part of the observed emission, particularly at close
separations from the galaxy disc, may originate from recombination of
photoionised gas stripped from the main body of ESO137-001. We also identify a
large number of bright compact knots within in the tail, with line ratios
characteristic of HII regions. These HII regions, despite residing in a
stripped gas tail, have quite typical line ratios, densities, temperatures, and
metallicity ($\sim0.7$ solar). The majority of these HII regions are embedded
within diffuse gas from the tail, which is dynamically cool ($\sigma \sim
25-50\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ ). This fact, together with a lack of appreciable
gradients in age and metallicity, suggests that these HII regions formed in
situ. While our analysis represents a first attempt to characterise the rich
physics of the ESO137-001 tail, future work is needed to address the importance
of other mechanisms, such as thermal conduction and magneto hydrodynamic waves,
in powering the emission in the tail.

declining SNe Ia, including SN 2001ay, and provides a more natural explanation
for its observed properties than other SN Ia explosion models. Previous
synthetic light curves and spectra of violent DD mergers demonstrate a strong
dependence on viewing angle, which is in conflict with observations. Here, we
demonstrate that the light curves and spectra of the spiral merger are less
sensitive to the viewing angle than violent mergers, in closer agreement with

binaries with properties suggestive of mass-transfer formation via Roche lobe
overflow, specifically through an asymptotic giant branch star transferring
mass to a main sequence secondary, yielding a BSS binary with a WD companion.
In NGC 188, a BSS formed by this mechanism within the past 400 Myr will have a
WD companion hot and luminous enough to be directly detected as a FUV
photometric excess with HST. Comparing expected BSS FUV emission to observed
photometry reveals four BSSs with WD companions above 12,000 K (younger than
250 Myr) and three WD companions with temperatures between 11,000-12,000 K.
These BSS+WD binaries all formed through recent mass transfer. The location of
the young BSSs in an optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) indicates that
distance from the zero-age main sequence does not necessarily correlate with
BSS age. There is no clear CMD separation between mass transfer-formed BSSs and
those likely formed through other mechanisms, such as collisions. The seven
detected WD companions place a lower limit on the mass-transfer formation
frequency of 33%. We consider other possible formation mechanisms by comparing
properties of the BSS population to theoretical predictions. We conclude that
14 BSS binaries likely formed from mass transfer, resulting in an inferred
mass-transfer formation frequency of approximately 67%.

matter-dominated phase grow linearly with the scale factor prior to the onset
of radiation domination, which leads to enhanced inhomogeneity on small scales
if dark matter thermally and kinetically decouples during the matter-dominated
phase. The microhalos that form from these enhanced perturbations significantly
boost the self-annihilation rate for dark matter. This has important
implications for indirect detection experiments: the larger annihilation rate
will result in observable signals from dark matter candidates that are usually
deemed untestable. As a proof of principle, we consider Binos in heavy
supersymmetry with an intermediate extended Higgs sector and all other
superpartners decoupled. We find that these isolated Binos, which lie under the
neutrino floor, can account for the dark matter relic density while also
leading to observable predictions for Fermi-LAT. Current limits on the
annihilation cross section from Fermi-LAT's observations of dwarf spheroidal

how the virtual crystal field fluctuations manifest in Er2Ti2O7 using a

that massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale
($\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present
study is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a
filament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can
expand $\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\gtrsim10^4
M_\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that
end, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\odot-10^5 M_\odot$) are
evolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the
computed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared
with those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\lesssim100$ Myr, in
the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the
above compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to
two-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by
primordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of
young massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the
observed ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the
expansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body
calculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with
$\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded
cluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their

provide new ways of generating the observed baryon asymmetry in the early
universe, as well as addressing the cosmic coincidence between dark matter and
baryon abundances. This suggests a new possible connection between weak scale
new particle physics and modern cosmology. This review summarizes the general
ideas and simple model examples of the two recently proposed WIMP baryogenesis
mechanisms: baryogenesis from WIMP dark matter annihilation during thermal
freezeout, and baryogenesis from metastable WIMP decay after thermal freezeout.
This letter also discusses the interesting phenomenology of these models, in
particular the experimental signals that can be probed in the intensity
frontier experiments and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments.

quarkonium hybrids from QCD. We identify the symmetries of the system made of a
heavy quark, a heavy antiquark, and glue in the static limit. Corrections to
this limit can be obtained order by order in an expansion in the inverse of the
mass $m$ of the heavy quark. At order $1/m$ in the expansion, we obtain at the
level of potential Non-Relativistic QCD a system of coupled Schr\""odinger
equations that describes hybrid spin-symmetry multiplets, including the mixing
of different static energies into the hybrid states, an effect known as
$\Lambda$-doubling in molecular physics. In the short distance, the static
potentials depend on two nonperturbative parameters, the gluelump mass and the
quadratic slope, which can be determined from lattice calculations. We adopt a
renormalon subtraction scheme for the calculation of the perturbative part of
the potential. We numerically solve the coupled Schr\""odinger equations and
obtain the masses for the lowest lying spin-symmetry multiplets for $c\bar{c}$,
$b\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ hybrids. The $\Lambda$-doubling effect breaks the
degeneracy between opposite parity spin-symmetry multiplets and lowers the mass
of the multiplets that get mixed contributions of different static energies. We
compare our findings to the experimental data, direct lattice computations, sum
rules calculations, and discuss the relation to the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

extreme regimes of wetting: the one called Cassie-Baxter (CB) with air pockets
trapped underneath the droplet and the one characterized by the homogeneous
wetting of the surface, called the Wenzel (W) state. A way to investigate the
transition between these two states is by means of evaporation experiments, in
which the droplet starts in a CB state and, as its volume decreases, penetrates
the surface's grooves, reaching a W state. Here we present a theoretical model
based on the global interfacial energies for CB and W states that allows us to
predict the thermodynamic wetting state of the droplet for a given volume and
surface texture. We first analyze the influence of the surface geometric
parameters on the droplet's final wetting state with constant volume, and show
that it depends strongly on the surface texture. We then vary the volume of the
droplet keeping fixed the geometric surface parameters to mimic evaporation and
show that the drop experiences a transition from the CB to the W state when its
volume reduces, as observed in experiments. To investigate the dependency of
the wetting state on the initial state of the droplet, we implement a cellular
Potts model in three dimensions. Simulations show a very good agreement with
theory when the initial state is W, but it disagrees when the droplet is
initialized in a CB state, in accordance with previous observations which show
that the CB state is metastable in many cases. Both simulations and theoretical

providing for the first time an opportunity to probe both interstellar gas at

galaxies. We observe distinct gas absorption properties among different lenses
and among sightlines of individual lenses. Specifically, while the quadruple
lens for HE0435-1223 shows no absorption features to very sensitive limits
along all four sightlines, strong Mg II, Fe II, Mg I, and Ca II absorption
transitions are detected along both sightlines near the double lens for
HE0047-1756, and in one of the two sightlines near the double lens for
HE1104-1805. The absorbers are resolved into 8-15 individual components with a
line-of-sight velocity spread of dv~300-600 km/s. The large ionic column
densities, log N>14, observed in two components suggest that these may be Lyman
limit or damped Lya absorbers with a significant neutral hydrogen fraction. The
majority of the absorbing components exhibit a uniform super solar Fe/Mg ratio
with a scatter of <0.1 dex across the full dv range. Given a predominantly old
stellar population in these lensing galaxies, we argue that the observed large

multi-sightline approach provide a powerful tool to resolve the origin of

Uncertainties in these rates translate to uncertainties in $^{34}$S production

have the potential to aid in the classification of presolar grains.
  Purpose: Determine resonance energies for the
$^{34g,m}$Cl($p,\gamma$)$^{35}$Ar reactions within the region of astrophyical
interest for classical novae to a precision of a few keV as an essential first
step toward constraining their thermonuclear reaction rates.
  Method: $^{35}$Ar excited states were populated by the
$^{36}$Ar($d,t$)$^{35}$Ar reaction at $E$(d)=22~MeV and reaction products were
momentum analyzed by a high resolution quadrupole-dipole-dipole-dipole (Q3D)
magnetic spectrograph.
  Results: Seventeen new $^{35}$Ar levels have been detected at a statistically
significant level in the region $E_x\approx$~5.9-6.7~MeV ($E_r$ \textless~800~
keV) and their excitation energies have been determined to typical
uncertainties of 3~keV. The uncertainties for five previously known levels have
also been reduced substantially. The measured level density was compared to
those calculated using the WBMB Hamiltonian within the $sd-pf$ model space.
  Conclusions: Most of the resonances in the region of astrophyical interest
have likely been discovered and their energies have been determined, but the
resonance strengths are still unknown, and experimentally constraining the
$^{34g,m}$Cl($p,\gamma$)$^{35}$Ar reaction rates will require further
experiments.

the underlying spin representation of the affine Hecke algebra in principal

a Higgs portal interaction. The global $U(1)$ symmetry of the complex singlet
can be either broken or unbroken and we study each scenario. In the unbroken
case, the global $U(1)$ symmetry protects the complex singlet from decaying,
leading to an ideal cold dark matter candidate with approximately 100 GeV mass
along with a significant proportion of thermal relic dark matter abundance. In
the broken case, we have developed a renormalization-scale optimization
technique to significantly narrow the parameter space and in some situations,
provide unique predictions for all the model's couplings and masses. We have
found there exists a second Higgs boson with a mass of approximately
$550\,\rm{GeV}$ that mixes with the known $125\,\rm{GeV}$ Higgs with a large
mixing angle $\sin\theta\approx 0.47$ consistent with current experimental
limits. The imaginary part of the complex singlet in the broken case could
provide axion dark matter for a wide range of models. Upon including
interactions of the complex scalar with an additional vector-like fermion, we
explore the possibility of a diphoton excess in both the unbroken and the
broken cases. In the unbroken case, the model can provide a natural explanation
for diphoton excess if extra terms are introduced providing extra contributions
to the singlet mass. In the broken case, we find a set of coupling solutions
that yield a second Higgs boson of mass $720\,\rm{GeV}$ and an $830\,\rm{GeV}$
extra vector-like fermion $F$, which is able to address the $750\,\rm{GeV}$ LHC

the system across boundaries between valleys. The mean square displacement time

gives a highly accurate account of the MD data; on the second ""crossover""

optimal power flow (OPF) problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
globally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for
which the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the
success or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether
the relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing
conditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical
conjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical
characteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two
equivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based
conditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation
fails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the
other formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success
(or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the
network physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the
SDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable
of solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization
theory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. We use the example
OPF problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for
polynomial optimization and a related ""mixed semidefinite/second-order cone
programming"" hierarchy.

offers the possibility that the Universe passes smoothly through it, without
any catastrophic effects. Then the question is if the effects of a Type IV
singularity can be detected in the process of cosmic evolution. In this paper
we address this question in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. As we demonstrate,
the effects of a Type IV singularity appear in the Hubble flow parameters,
which determine the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system. So we study
various inflation models incorporating a Type IV singularity, with the
singularity occurring at the end of inflation. Particularly we study a toy
model and a singular version of the $R^2$ gravity Hubble rate. As we evince,
some of the Hubble flow parameters become singular at the singularity, an
effect which indicates that at that point a dynamical instability occurs. This
dynamical instability eventually indicates the graceful exit from inflation. We
demonstrate that the toy model has an unstable de Sitter point at the
singularity, so indeed graceful exit could be triggered. In the case of the
singular inflation model, graceful exit proceeds in the standard way. In the
case of the singular inflation model, we found various scenarios for singular
evolution, most of which are compatible with observations, and only one leads
to severe instabilities. We also compare the ordinary Starobinsky with the
singular inflation model, and we point out the qualitative and quantitative
differences. Finally, we study the late-time dynamics of the toy model and of
the singular inflation model and we demonstrate that the unification of early
and late-time acceleration can be achieved. We also show that it is possible to
achieve late-time acceleration similar to the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model.

first-principles density functional theory calculations. Including van der
Waals forces in the density functional is essential to capture the interaction
between MoS2 and a metal surface, and obtain reliable interface potential steps
and Schottky barriers. Special care is taken to construct interface structures
that have a mismatch between the MoS2 and the metal lattices of <1%. MoS2 is
chemisorbed on the early transition metal Ti, which leads to a strong
perturbation of its (electronic) structure and a pinning of the Fermi level
0.54 eV below the MoS2 conduction band due to interface states. MoS2 is
physisorbed on Au, where the bonding hardly perturbs the electronic structure.
The bonding of MoS2 on other metals lies between these two extreme cases, with
interface interactions for the late 3d transition metals Co, Ni, Cu and the
simple metal Mg that are somewhat stronger than for the late 4d/5d transition
metals Pd, Ag, Pt and the simple metal Al. Even a weak interaction, such as in
the case of Al, gives interface states, however, with energies inside the MoS2
band gap, which pin the Fermi level below the conduction band.

Thus, live Avatar migration (i.e., migrating a UE's Avatar to a suitable
cloudlet based on the UE's location) is enabled to maintain low E2E delay
between each UE and its Avatar. On the other hand, the migration itself incurs
extra overheads in terms of resources of the Avatar, which compromise the
performance of applications running in the Avatar. By considering the gain

PRIMAL maximizes the profit in terms of maintaining the low average E2E delay
between UEs and their Avatars and minimizing the migration cost simultaneously.

off-resonance for the system, in the Fourier sense. We show that
superoscillating sources can temporarily induce resonance during the period

question as to how the system `undoes' the `false resonance' after the full

examples of systems which might be capable of distilling the temporary

at high frequencies, opening up the possibility of low frequency detection of
`fast' microphysics through superoscillations. We conclude that, either

the theory of equitable partitions it is referred to as an equitable

large and has a high degree of symmetry, we discuss how equitable
decompositions can be used to effectively bound both the network's spectral
radius and spectral gap, which are associated with dynamic processes on the

any position angle, brightness and abundance required. Most importantly, we

complementary approaches, one based on Nakajima--Zwanzig--Mori time-convolution

formulations provide a starting point to describe the time-evolution of the
reduced density matrix. A key in both approaches is to obtain the so called
""memory kernel"" or ""generator"", going beyond second or fourth order
perturbation techniques. While numerically converged techniques are available
for the TC memory kernel, the canonical approach to obtain the TCL generator is
based on inverting a super-operator in the \emph{full} Hilbert space, which is
difficult to perform and thus, all applications of the TCL approach rely on a
perturbative scheme of some sort. Here, the TCL generator is expressed using a
reduced system propagator which can be obtained from system observables alone
and requires the calculation of super-operators and their inverse in the
\emph{reduced }Hilbert space rather than the full one. This makes the
formulation amenable to quantum impurity solvers or to diagrammatic techniques,
such as the nonequilibrium Green's function. We implement the TCL approach for
the resonant level model driven away from equilibrium and compare the time
scales for the decay of the generator with that of the memory kernel in the TC
approach. Furthermore, the effects of temperature, source-drain bias, and gate
potential on the TCL/TC generators are discussed.

borrow stock from the securities lending market. Because of haircuts, she posts
additional cash margin to the lender which needs to be financed at her
unsecured debt rate. This paper incorporates funding asymmetry (borrowed cash
and invested cash earning different interest rates) and realistic stock
financing cost into the classic option pricing theory. It is shown that an
option position can be dynamically replicated and self financed in the presence
of these funding costs. Noting that the funding amounts and costs are different
for long and short positions, we extend Black-Scholes partial differential
equations (PDE) per position side. The PDE's nonlinear funding cost terms
create a free funding boundary and would result in the bid price for a long
position on an option lower than the ask price for a short position. An
iterative Crank-Nicholson finite difference method is developed to compute
European and American vanilla option prices. Numerical results show that
reasonable funding cost parameters can easily produce same magnitude of bid/ask
spread of less liquid, longer term options as observed in the market place.
Portfolio level pricing examples show the netting effect of hedges, which could
moderate impact of funding costs.

adaptation and domain generalization, are concerned with such tasks, where the
only difference between those frameworks is the availability of the unlabeled

domain generalization cannot. We propose Scatter Component Analyis (SCA), a
fast representation learning algorithm that can be applied to both domain
adaptation and domain generalization. SCA is based on a simple geometrical
measure, i.e., scatter, which operates on reproducing kernel Hilbert space. SCA
finds a representation that trades between maximizing the separability of
classes, minimizing the mismatch between domains, and maximizing the
separability of data; each of which is quantified through scatter. The
optimization problem of SCA can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem,
which results in a fast and exact solution. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmark cross-domain object recognition datasets verify that SCA performs
much faster than several state-of-the-art algorithms and also provides
state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both domain adaptation and domain
generalization. We also show that scatter can be used to establish a

treatment decision, Lu et al. (2013) proposed a penalized least squared
regression framework for a fixed number of predictors, which is robust against
the misspecification of the conditional mean model. Two problems arise: (i) in
a world of explosively big data, effective methods are needed to handle
ultra-high dimensional data set, for example, with the dimension of predictors
is of the non-polynomial (NP) order of the sample size; (ii) both the
propensity score and conditional mean models need to be estimated from data
under NP dimensionality.
  In this paper, we propose a two-step estimation procedure for deriving the
optimal treatment regime under NP dimensionality. In both steps, penalized
regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the
conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified.
The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection
consistency and oracle distributions, of the proposed estimators are
investigated. In addition, we study the limiting distribution of the estimated
value function for the obtained optimal treatment regime. The empirical
performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated by simulations and
an application to a depression dataset from the STAR*D study.

the traffic offloading process for current wireless networks. In this paper, we
investigate the incentive problem in SDN-at-edge of how to motivate a third
party access points (APs) such as WiFi and smallcells to offload traffic for
the central base stations (BSs). The APs will only admit the traffic from the
BS under the precondition that their own traffic demand is satisfied. Under the
information asymmetry that the APs know more about own traffic demands, the BS
needs to distribute the payment in accordance with the APs' idle capacity to
maintain a compatible incentive. First, we apply a contract-theoretic approach
to model and analyze the service trading between the BS and APs. Furthermore,
other two incentive mechanisms: optimal discrimination contract and linear
pricing contract are introduced to serve as the comparisons of the anti adverse
selection contract. Finally, the simulation results show that the contract can
effectively incentivize APs' participation and offload the cellular network
traffic. Furthermore, the anti adverse selection contract achieves the optimal
outcome under the information asymmetry scenario.

numerical calculations for the pairing gaps and nuclear level densities (NLD),
of which an anomalous enhancement has been experimentally observed at low

of classical interest: Gauss' class number problem asks for a determination of
those fields counted by F(h). The unconditional computation of F(h) for h up to
100 was completed by M. Watkins, using ideas of Goldfeld and Gross-Zagier;
Soundararajan has more recently made conjectures about the order of magnitude
of F(h) as h increases without bound, and determined its average order. In the
present paper, we refine Soundararajan's conjecture to a conjectural asymptotic
formula and also consider the subtler problem of determining the number F(G) of
imaginary quadratic fields with class group isomorphic to a given finite
abelian group G. Using Watkins' tables, one can show that some abelian groups
do not occur as the class group of any imaginary quadratic field (for instance
the elementary abelian group of order 27 does not). This observation is
explained in part by the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics, which have often been used
to study the distribution of the p-part of an imaginary quadratic class group.
We combine heuristics of Cohen-Lenstra together with our refinement of
Soundararajan's conjecture to make precise predictions about the asymptotic
nature of the entire imaginary quadratic class group, in particular addressing
the above-mentioned phenomenon of ""missing"" class groups, for the case of
p-groups as p tends to infinity. Furthermore, conditionally on the Generalized
Riemann Hypothesis, we extend Watkins' data, tabulating F(h) for odd h up to
10^6 and F(G) for G a p-group of odd order with |G| up to 10^6. The numerical
evidence matches quite well with our conjectures.

observational fact that low-mass dwarfs can be very gas-rich, and thereby
investigate the dynamical and chemical evolution of very gas-rich, dissipative
dwarf-dwarf mergers. We find that the remnants of dwarf-dwarf mergers can be
dominated by new stellar populations formed from the triggered starbursts and
consequently can have blue colors and higher metallicities (Z~[0.2-1]Z_sun). We
also find that the remnants of these mergers can have rather high
mass-densities (10^4 M_sun pc^-3) within the central 10 pc and small half-light
radii (40-100 pc). The radial stellar structures of some merger remnants are
similar to those of nucleated dwarfs. Star formation can continue in nuclear
gas disks (R<100 pc) surrounding stellar galactic nuclei (SGNs) so that the
SGNs can finally have multiple stellar populations with different ages and
metallicities. These very compact blue remnants can be identified as UCBDs soon
after merging and as nucleated dwarfs after fading of young stars. We discuss
these results in the context of the origins of metal-rich ultra-compact dwarfs
(UCDs) and SGNs.

dimension). We pose the problem of computing normal vectors to the inlier
subspace as a non-convex $\ell_1$ minimization problem on the sphere, which we
call Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) problem. We provide theoretical
guarantees under which every global solution to DPCP is a vector in the
orthogonal complement of the inlier subspace. Moreover, we relax the non-convex
DPCP problem to a recursion of linear programs whose solutions are shown to
converge in a finite number of steps to a vector orthogonal to the subspace. In
particular, when the inlier subspace is a hyperplane, the solutions to the
recursion of linear programs converge to the global minimum of the non-convex

In our previous paper [H. Tajima, {\it et. al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 89}, 033617
(2014)], including pairing fluctuations within an extended $T$-matrix
approximation (ETMA), we showed that strong pairing fluctuations cause the
so-called spin-gap phenomenon, where $\chi$ is anomalously suppressed even in
the normal state near the superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$.
In this paper, we extend this work to the superfluid phase below $T_{\rm c}$,
to clarify how this many-body phenomenon is affected by the superfluid order.
From the comparison of the ETMA $\chi$ with the Yosida function describing the
spin susceptibility in a weak-coupling BCS superfluid, we identify the region
where pairing fluctuations crucially affect this magnetic quantity below
$T_{\rm c}$ in the phase diagram with respect to the strength of a pairing
interaction and the temperature. This spin-gap regime is found to be consistent
with the previous pseudogap regime determined from the pseudogapped density of
states. We also compare our results with a recent experiment on a $^6$Li Fermi
gas. Since the spin susceptibility is sensitive to the formation of
spin-singlet preformed pairs, our results would be useful for the study of
pseudogap physics in an ultracold Fermi gas on the viewpoint of the spin

that due to the improved thermal stability of exchange spring media over

cases are investigated: first the case where the step-size is constant, and
second the case where the step-size is adapted using cumulative step-size
adaptation. We exhibit for each case a Markov chain describing the behaviour of
the algorithm. Stability of the chain implies, by applying a law of large
numbers, either convergence or divergence of the algorithm. Divergence is the
desired behaviour. In the constant step-size case, we show stability of the
Markov chain and prove the divergence of the algorithm. In the cumulative
step-size adaptation case, we prove stability of the Markov chain in the
simplified case where the cumulation parameter equals 1, and discuss steps to
obtain similar results for the full (default) algorithm where the cumulation
parameter is smaller than 1. The stability of the Markov chain allows us to
deduce geometric divergence or convergence , depending on the dimension,
constraint angle, population size and damping parameter, at a rate that we
estimate. Our results complement previous studies where stability was assumed.

choices for solving this problem. This paper proposes a new steganographic

transposition, secret key and cryptography. Both the secret key and secret
information are initially encrypted using multiple encryption algorithms
(bitxor operation, bits shuffling, and stego key-based encryption); these are,
subsequently, hidden in the host image pixels. In addition, the input image is
transposed before data hiding. Image transposition, bits shuffling, bitxoring,
stego key-based encryption, and gray-level modification introduce five
different security levels to the proposed scheme, making the data recovery
extremely difficult for attackers. The proposed technique is evaluated by
objective analysis using various image quality assessment metrics, producing
promising results in terms of imperceptibility and security. Moreover, the high
quality stego images and its minimal histogram changeability, also validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

matter fields in the undeformed Mini-Superspace approach, so the existence of a
non-vanishing Cosmological Constant is a direct consequence of the deformation
by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle. In fact, we are able to demonstrate
that a non-vanishing Cosmological Constant exists even in the deformed flat

Therefore, we introduce the lcm-filtration of a monomial ideal, and we study

observation of RX J2015.6+3711 performed in 2014, where we detected a coherent
X-ray modulation at a period of 7196+/-11 s, and discovered other significant
(>6sigma) small-amplitude periodicities which we interpret as the CV spin
period and the sidebands of a possible ~12 hr periodicity, respectively. The
0.3-10 keV spectrum can be described by a power law (Gamma = 1.15+/-0.04) with
a complex absorption pattern, a broad emission feature at 6.60+/-0.01 keV, and
an unabsorbed flux of (3.16+/-0.05)x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2. We observed a
significant spectral variability along the spin phase, which can be ascribed
mainly to changes in the density of a partial absorber and the power law
normalization. Archival X-ray observations carried out by the Chandra
satellite, and two simultaneous X-ray and UV/optical pointings with Swift,
revealed a gradual fading of the source in the soft X-rays over the last 13
years, and a rather stable X-ray-to-optical flux ratio (F_X/F_V ~1.4-1.7).
Based on all these properties, we identify this source with a magnetic CV, most
probably of the intermediate polar type. The 2 hr spin period makes RX
J2015.6+3711 the second slowest rotator of the class, after RX J0524+4244
(""Paloma"", P_spin~2.3 hr). Although we cannot unambiguously establish the true
orbital period with these observations, RX J2015.6+3711 appears to be a key

is obtained from $V_{low-k}$ by way of a folded-diagram effective interaction
method. For decimation momentum $\Lambda \simeq 2 fm^{-1}$, the $V_{low-k}$
interactions derived from different realistic $V_{NN}$ models are nearly model
independent, and so are the resulting shell-model effective interactions. For
nucleons in a low-density nuclear medium like valence nucleons near the nuclear
surface, such effective interactions derived from free-space $V_{NN}$ are
satisfactory in reproducing experimental nuclear properties. But it is not so
for nucleons in a nuclear medium with density near or beyond nuclear matter
saturation density. In this case it may be necessary to include the effects
from Brown-Rho (BR) scaling of hadrons and/or three-nucleon forces $V_{3N}$,
effectively changing the free-space $V_{NN}$ into a density-dependent one. The
density-dependent effects from BR scaling and $V_{3N}$ are compared with those
from empirical Skyrme effective interactions.

Tri II has a very negative radial velocity (<v_r>=-383.7^{+3.0}_{-3.3} km/s)

II has complex internal kinematics. Its radial velocity dispersion increases
from 4.4^{+2.8}_{-2.0} km/s in the central 2' to 14.1^{+5.8}_{-4.2} km/s

\sigma_{vr}=9.9^{+3.2}_{-2.2} km/s. From the two bright RGB member stars we
measure an average metallicity <[Fe/H]>=-2.6+/-0.2, placing Tri II among the
most metal-poor Milky Way dwarf galaxies. In addition, the spectra of the
fainter member stars exhibit differences in their line widths that could be the
indication of a metallicity dispersion in the system. All these properties
paint a complex picture for Tri II, whose nature and current state are largely

to favor a scenario in which Tri II is a dwarf galaxy that is either disrupting

accuracy in the human action detection, and proposed technique outperforms the

approaches in functional and longitudinal data analysis and we extend it to
analyze functional/longitudinal data observed on a general $d$-dimensional
domain. The computational issues emerging in the extension are fully addressed
with our proposed solutions. The local linear smoothing technique is employed
to perform estimation because of its capabilities of performing large-scale
smoothing and of handling data with different sampling schemes (possibly on
irregular domain) in addition to its nice theoretical properties. Besides
taking the fast Fourier transform strategy in smoothing, the modern GPGPU
(general-purpose computing on graphics processing units) architecture is
applied to perform parallel computation to save computation time. To resolve
the out-of-memory issue due to large-scale data, the random projection
procedure is applied in the eigendecomposition step. We show that the proposed
estimators can achieve the classical nonparametric rates for longitudinal data
and the optimal convergence rates for functional data if the number of
observations per sample is of the order $(n/ \log n)^{d/4}$. Finally, the
performance of our approach is demonstrated with simulation studies and the

history of programming languages is marked by innovations, diversifications,
lateral transfers and social influences; moreover, it represents an
intermediate case study between the evolution of human languages and the
evolution of technology. In this paper we study the application of the
Darwinian explanation to the programming languages evolution by discussing to
what extent the evolutionary mechanisms distinctive of biology can be applied
to this area. We show that a number of evolutionary building blocks can be
recognised in the realm of computer languages, but we also identify critical
issues. Far from being crystal clear, this fine-grained study shows to be a
useful tool to assess recent results about programming languages phylogenies.
Finally, we show that rich evolutionary patterns, such as co-evolution,
macro-evolutionary trends, niche construction and exaptation, can be
effectively applied to programming languages and provide for interesting

backward It\^o integral, and then for a given output function $h$, define the
$""gain\ operator""$ as the composition of output function $h$ and the

Suppose that the output function is either order-preserving or
anti-order-preserving in the usual vector order and the global Lipschitz
constant of the output function is less than the absolute of the negative
principal eigenvalue of linear matrix. Then we prove the so-called {\it

for input-to-state characteristic operator at the fixed point is a globally
attracting stochastic equilibrium for the random dynamical system generated by
the stochastic system. Under the same assumption for the relation between the

plasma towards equilibrium can be studied investigating a 5D gravitational
dual. The process driving the plasma out-of-equilibrium can be described by
boundary sourcing, a deformation of the boundary metric; the analysis of the
late-time dynamics allows to understand how the hydrodynamic regime settles in.
We apply the method to a boost-invariant case, considering the effects of
different quenches, solving the Einstein equations in the bulk and studying the
time-dependence of observables such as the effective temperature, the energy
density and the pressures.
  The main outcome is that, if the effective temperature of the system when the
quench is switched off is $T_{eff}(\tau^*)=500$ MeV, thermalization is reached
within a time of ${\cal O}$(1 fm/c), an important information if the case of
the QCD plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is considered.

investigated for a Kitaev model defined on a decorated honeycomb lattice by
using the quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the Majorana fermion
representation. The ground state of this quantum spin model is given by two
kinds of chiral spin liquids: one is topologically trivial with Abelian anyon
excitations, and the other is topologically nontrivial with non-Abelian anyon
excitations. While lowering temperature, the model exhibits several crossovers
in the paramagnetic state, which originate from the fractionalization of
quantum spins into Majorana fermions, in addition to a phase transition
associated with time reversal symmetry breaking. We show that the spin
correlation develops around the crossover temperatures, whereas it shows a
slight change at the critical temperature, as in other Kitaev-type models. We
also calculate the excitation spectrum in terms of Majorana fermions, and find
that the excitation gap in the non-Abelian phase is fragile against thermal
fluctuations of the $Z_2$ fluxes, while that in the Abelian phase remains open.

use of Monte Carlo simulation. The mobile Potts model is related to a diluted
Potts model which is also studied here by a mean-field approximation. We
consider a lattice where each site is either vacant or occupied by a $q$-state
Potts spin. The Potts spin can move from one site to a nearby vacant site. In
order to study the surface sublimation, we consider a system of Potts spins
contained in a recipient with a concentration $c$ defined as the ratio of the
number of Potts spins $N_s$ to the total number of lattice sites $N_L = N_x
\times N_y \times N_z$. Taking into account the attractive interaction between
the nearest-neighboring Potts spins, we study the phase transition as functions
of various physical parameters such as the temperature, the shape of the
recipient and the spin concentration. We show that as the temperature
increases, surface spins are detached from the solid phase to form a gas in the
empty space. Surface order parameters indicate different behaviors depending on
the distance to the surface. At high temperatures, if the concentration is high
enough, the interior spins undergo a first-order phase transition to an
orientationally disordered phase. The mean-field results are shown as functions
of temperature, pressure and chemical potential, which confirm in particular
the first-order character of the transition.

the model. Markov chain aggregation is then used to derive a macro chain for
the complete graph as well as a meso-level description for the two-community
graph composed of two (weakly) coupled sub-communities. In both cases, a
detailed understanding of the model behavior is possible using Markov chain
tools. More importantly, however, this setting provides an analytical scenario
to study the discrepancy between the homogeneous mixing case and the model on a
slightly more complex topology. We show that memory effects are introduced at
the macro level when we aggregate over agent attributes without sensitivity to
the microscopic details and quantify these effects using concepts from
information theory. In this way, the method facilitates the analysis of the
relation between microscopic processes and a their aggregation to a macroscopic
level of description and informs about the complexity of a system introduced by
heterogeneous interaction relations.

that offers different versions of the same media content to adapt the delivery
process over the Internet to dynamic bandwidth fluctuations and different user
device capabilities. The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm for video streaming allows
to leverage the cooperation among peers, guaranteeing to serve every video
request with increased scalability and reduced cost. We propose to combine
these two approaches in a P2P-DASH architecture, exploiting the potentiality of
both. The new platform is made of several swarms, and a different DASH
representation is streamed within each of them; unlike client-server DASH
architectures, where each client autonomously selects which version to download
according to current network conditions and to its device resources, we put
forth a new rate control strategy implemented at peer site to maintain a good
viewing quality to the local user and to simultaneously guarantee the
successful operation of the P2P swarms. The effectiveness of the solution is
demonstrated through simulation and it indicates that the P2P-DASH platform is
able to warrant its users a very good performance, much more satisfying than in
a conventional P2P environment where DASH is not employed. Through a comparison
with a reference DASH system modeled via the Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
approach, the new system is shown to outperform such reference architecture. To
further validate the proposal, both in terms of robustness and scalability,
system behavior is investigated in the critical condition of a flash crowd,
showing that the strong upsurge of new users can be successfully revealed and
gradually accommodated.

find that the gas flow between a trader and a consumer is unique whenever the
trader is modeled to exert market power in the consumer's market. We
demonstrate our findings by computing the extreme points of the polyhedral

Their precise role in the interplay between itinerance and localisation, long
known to underpin Mottness in d-band oxides, has however received much less
attention. We analyse the relevance of the GdFeO3 tilt in detail in a
representative setting of a partially-filled e g orbital system. We identify a
new generalised principle of broad relevance, namely, that this tilt acts like
a structural ""double exchange"" and acts contrary to the well-known
Anderson-Hasegawa double exchange. As a function of this tilt, therefore, a
phase transition from a Mott-Hubbard insulator to an incoherent bad-metal
occurs as an effective band-width-controlled Mott transition. We analyse the
incoherent metal in detail by studying one- and two-particle spectral responses
and propose that this selective-metal is a novel orbital analogue of the FL*

qualitatively discuss the effect of strain on thin films of such d-band oxides

relatively early merger state with two distinct nuclei separated by ~1.""5.
Previous Chandra observations have resolved the two nuclei, showing that they
are both active and obscured by Compton-thick material. Although they cannot be
resolved by NuSTAR, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the NuSTAR data at
energies >10 keV, we clearly detect, for the first time, both the primary and
the reflection continuum components. The NuSTAR hard X-ray spectrum is
dominated by the primary continuum piercing through an absorbing column density
which is mildly optically thick to Compton scattering (tau ~ 1.2, N_H ~ 1.5 x
10^(24) cm^-2). We detect moderate hard X-ray (> 10 keV) flux variability up to
20% on short (15-20 ksec) timescales. The amplitude of the variability is
maximum at ~30 keV and is likely to originate from the primary continuum of the
southern nucleus. Nevertheless, the mean hard X-ray flux on longer timescales
(years) is relatively constant. Moreover, the two nuclei remain Compton-thick,
although we find evidence of variability of the material along the line of
sight with column densities N_H <~ 2 x 10^(23) cm-2 over long (~3-15 years)
timescales. The observed X-ray emission in the NuSTAR energy range is fully
consistent with the sum of the best-fit models of the spatially resolved

dimensions with radial initial data in the energy space. We describe the global
dynamics of all the solutions of which the energy is at most slightly larger
than that of the ground states, according to whether it stays in a neighborhood
of them, blows up in finite time or scatters. In analogy with the paper by
Schlag and the first author on the subcritical equation, the proof uses an
analysis of the hyperbolic dynamics near them and the variational structure far
from them. The key step that allows to classify the solutions is the one-pass
lemma. The main difference from the subcritical case is that one has to
introduce a scaling parameter in order to describe the dynamics near them. One
has to take into account this parameter in the analysis around the ground
states by introducing some orthogonality conditions. One also has to take it
into account in the proof of the one-pass lemma by comparing the contribution
in the variational region and in the hyperbolic region.

random effects of small area means when some of these effects assume extreme

Fay-Herriot model, used for modeling area-level data, under normality
assumptions of the random effects may overestimate random effects variance,
thus provides less than ideal shrinkage towards the synthetic regression

substantive outliers of random effects result in a large estimate of the random
effects variance in the Fay-Herriot model, thereby achieving little shrinkage
to the synthetic part of the model or little reduction in posterior variance
associated with the regular Bayes estimator for any of the small areas. While a
scale mixture of normal distributions with known mixing distribution for the
random effects has been found to be effective in presence of outliers, the
solution depends on the mixing distribution. As a possible alternative solution
to the problem, a two-component normal mixture model has been proposed based on
noninformative priors on the model variance parameters, regression coefficients

28 years of radio observation. We identify that the time derivative of the
rotational frequency ($\nu$) varies quasi-periodically with a period of
$\sim$350 days, switching mainly between two spin-down states. The profile
shape of the pulsar is correlated with the $\dot \nu$ variation, producing two
slightly different profile shapes corresponding to high- and low-$\dot \nu$
states. In addition to these two normal emission states, we confirm the
occasional flare-state of the pulsar, in which the emission appears early in
spin phase compared to that of the common normal emission. The profile of the
flare-state is significantly different from that of the two normal emission
states. The correlation analysis further shows that the flare-state is not
directly linked with the $\dot \nu$ changes. With a simple emission beam model,
we estimate the emission altitude of the normal emission to be 240~km, and
explain the origin of the flare-state as an emission height variation from the
leading edge of the beam. We also argue that the emission of these states can
be explained with a partially active beam model. In this scenario, the trailing
portion of the radio beam is usually active and the normal emission is
produced. The flare-state occurs when the leading edge of the beam becomes
active while the trailing part is being blocked. This model estimates a fixed
emission altitude of 360~km. However, the cause of the flare-state (i.e. the
emission height variation, or the time-dependent activity across the radio

Since analyzing a scheduling algorithm is intractable using the conventional
mathematical tool, our goal is to minimize the largest queue-overflow
probability achieved by the algorithm. In the large deviation setting, this
problem is equivalent to maximizing the asymptotic decay rate of the largest
queue-overflow probability. We first derive an upper bound on the decay rate of
the queue overflow probability as the queue overflow threshold approaches
infinity. Then, we study several structural properties of the minimum-cost-path
to overflow of the queue with the largest length, which is basically equivalent
to the decay rate of the largest queue-overflow probability. Given these
properties, we prove that the queue with the largest length follows a sample
path with linear increment. For certain parameter value, the scheduling
algorithm is asymptotically optimal in reducing the largest queue length.
Through numerical results, we have shown the large deviation properties of the
queue length typically used in practice while varying one parameter of the
algorithm.

linking for Open Governamental Data Portals (ODPs). ODPs have been lately the
standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available
for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the
datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging
process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or
incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues
are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open
Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach
for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related
to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer
above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in
a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing
relations between tags.

turbulent flow, is proposed to model the growth of inertial particles as a
result of dynamic clustering at scales larger than the Kolmogorov length scale.
Particles able to stick or coalesce are expected to grow in size in flow
regions where preferential concentration is predicted by a critical Stokes
number $St=\tau_p/\tau_f \simeq 1 $. We postulate that, during growth, $St$
remains critical, with the particle response time $\tau_p$ evolving according
to the specific flow time scale $\tau_f$ defined by the vortices around which
progressively larger particles end up orbiting. This mechanism leads to the
prediction of the limiting size of aggregating particles in a turbulent flow.
Such limit is determined by the extent of the turbulent inertial range, which
can be formulated as a function of accessible integral-scale quantities. The
proposed dynamically critical Stokes growth provides a framework to interpret
particle aggregation, size growth and particle cluster growth in various
geophysical multi-phase flows.

then patterned and arrays of 75-nanometer-wide openings are etched in graphene

that they are biphasic. The core is a zinc blende monocrystal surrounded with

terminal (MT) and short range communications to save the bandwidth usage and
reduce the download delay in the cellular communication system. Specifically,
the MTs first cache in their local memories in off-peak hours and then exchange
the requested files with each other in the vicinity during peak hours. However,
prior works largely overlook MTs' heterogeneity in file preferences and their
selfish behaviours. In this paper, we practically categorize the MTs into
different interest groups according to the MTs' preferences. Each group of MTs
aims to increase the probability of successful file discovery from the
neighbouring MTs (from the same or different groups). Hence, we define the
groups' utilities as the probability of successfully discovering the file in
the neighbouring MTs, which should be maximized by deciding the caching
strategies of different groups. By modelling MTs' mobilities as homogeneous
Poisson point processes (HPPPs), we analytically characterize MTs' utilities in
closed-form. We first consider the fully cooperative case where a centralizer
helps all groups to make caching decisions. We formulate the problem as a
weighted-sum utility maximization problem, through which the maximum utility
trade-offs of different groups are characterized. Next, we study two benchmark
cases under selfish caching, namely, partial and no cooperation, with and
without inter-group file sharing, respectively. The optimal caching
distributions for these two cases are derived. Finally, numerical examples are
presented to compare the utilities under different cases and show the
effectiveness of the fully cooperative local caching compared to the two

recognized in the recent literature. In this work, we analyze the impact of the
masses of very neutron rich nuclei on the matter composition during collapse,
and the corresponding electron capture rate. To this aim, we introduce an
empirical modification of the popular Duflo-Zuker mass model to account for
possible shell quenching far from stability, and study the effect of the
quenching on the average electron capture rate. We show that the preeminence of
the $N=50$ and $N=82$ closed shells in the collapse dynamics is considerably
decreased if the shell gaps are reduced in the region of $^{78}$Ni and beyond.
As a consequence, local modifications of the overall electron capture rate up
to 30\% can be expected, with integrated values strongly dependent on the
stiffness of magicity quenching and progenitor mass and potential important
consequences on the entropy generation, the neutrino emissivity, and the mass
of the core at bounce. Our work underlines the importance of new experimental
measurements in this region of the nuclear chart, the most crucial information
being the nuclear mass and the Gamow-Teller strength. Reliable microscopic
calculations of the associated elementary rate, in a wide range of temperatures
and electron densities, optimized on these new empirical information, will be
additionally needed to get quantitative predictions of the collapse dynamics.

problems (CSPs) over a fixed template is that pp-interpretations between at
most countable \omega-categorical relational structures have two algebraic
counterparts for their polymorphism clones: a semantic one via the standard
algebraic operators H, S, P, and a syntactic one via clone homomorphisms
(capturing identities). We provide a similar characterization which
incorporates all relational constructions relevant for CSPs, that is,
homomorphic equivalence and adding singletons to cores in addition to
pp-interpretations. For the semantic part we introduce a new construction,
called reflection, and for the syntactic part we find an appropriate weakening
of clone homomorphisms, called h1 clone homomorphisms (capturing identities of
height 1).
  As a consequence, the complexity of the CSP of an at most countable
$\omega$-categorical structure depends only on the identities of height 1
satisfied in its polymorphism clone as well as the the natural uniformity
thereon. This allows us in turn to formulate a new elegant dichotomy conjecture
for the CSPs of reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures.
  Finally, we reveal a close connection between h1 clone homomorphisms and the
notion of compatibility with projections used in the study of the lattice of
interpretability types of varieties.

Trying to generalize this concept to the case of random vectors, or even
stochastic processes with continuous sample paths, the question arises how to

simple record is meant to be a stochastic process (or a random vector) $X_n$

complete record has to be larger than its predecessors in all components. The

assuming that the processes are in the max-domain of attraction of a max-stable
process. Furthermore, the distribution of $ X_n$, given that $ X_n$ is a record
is derived.

medium, the optical path difference and angular dispersion are boosted
proportionally, thereby allowing a smaller grating area and a smaller
spectrometer size. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy is used in
space-based monitoring of greenhouse and pollution gases in the Earth
atmosphere. On the extremely large telescopes currently under development,
mid-infrared high-resolution spectrographs will, among other things, be used to
characterize exo-planet atmospheres. At infrared wavelengths, Silicon is
transparent. This means that production methods used in the semiconductor
industry can be applied to the fabrication of immersed gratings. Using such
methods, we have designed and built immersed gratings for both space- and
ground-based instruments, examples being the TROPOMI instrument for the
European Space Agency Sentinel-5 precursor mission, Sentinel-5 (ESA) and the

the level of scattered light and the wavefront error induced. In this paper we

actual performance realized and present the results. In this paper, the
bread-board model (BBM) immersed grating developed for the SWIR-1 channel of

solving a maximization problem in the bounded space of the significant

challenge for understanding the fundamental processes in correlated materials.
Critical information underlying a phase transition, such as localized phase
competition, is difficult to reveal by measurements that are spatially averaged
over many phase separated regions. The ability to simultaneously track the
spatial and temporal evolution of such systems is essential to understanding
mesoscopic processes during a phase transition. Using state-of-the-art
time-resolved hard x-ray diffraction microscopy, we directly visualize the
structural phase progression in a VO2 film upon photoexcitation. Following a
homogenous in-plane optical excitation, the phase transformation is initiated
at discrete sites and completed by the growth of one lattice structure into the
other, instead of a simultaneous isotropic lattice symmetry change. The
time-dependent x-ray diffraction spatial maps show that the in-plane phase
progression in laser-superheated VO2 is via a displacive lattice transformation
as a result of relaxation from an excited monoclinic phase into a rutile phase.
The speed of the phase front progression is quantitatively measured, and is
faster than the process driven by in-plane thermal diffusion but slower than
the sound speed in VO2. The direct visualization of localized structural
changes in the time domain opens a new avenue to study mesoscopic processes in
driven systems.

a multitude of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebraic approximation properties pass from the

examples arises from compact group actions with the Rokhlin property. This
allows us to recover and extend the presently known permanence properties of
Rokhlin actions with a unified conceptual approach and a simple proof.
Moreover, this perspective allows us to obtain new results about such actions,

are found for the micro discharge when the water acts as a cathode, different
from the discharge when water behaves as an anode. Groups of snapshots of the
micro discharge formed at different discharge currents are captured by an
intensified charge-coupled device with controlled exposure time, and each group
consisted of 256 images taken in succession. Edge detection methods are used to
identify the water surface and then the total brightness is defined by adding
up the signal counts over the area of the micro discharge. Motions of the water
surface at different discharge currents show that the water surface lowers
increasingly rapidly when the water acts as a cathode. In contrast, the water
surface lowers at a constant speed when the water behaves as an anode. The
light curves are similar to logistic growth curves, suggesting that a
self-inhibition process occurs in the micro discharge. Meanwhile, the total
brightness increases linearly during the same time when the water acts as an
anode. Discharge-water interactions cause the micro discharge to evolve. The
charged particle bomb process is probably responsible for the different

that the correlation originates from two contributing factors. One seems to be
a power-law dependence between the two quantities for intermediate periods

R_Earth in short periods. This correlation may provide important constraints
for small-planet formation theories and for understanding the dynamical

The spatial pyramid and its variants have been very popular feature models due
to their success in balancing spatial location encoding and spatial invariance.
Although it seems straightforward to extend spatial pyramid to the temporal
domain (spatio-temporal pyramid), the large spatio-temporal diversity of
unconstrained videos and the resulting significantly higher dimensional
representations make it less appealing. This paper introduces the space-time
extended descriptor, a simple but efficient alternative way to include the
spatio-temporal location into the video features. Instead of only coding motion
information and leaving the spatio-temporal location to be represented at the
pooling stage, location information is used as part of the encoding step. This
method is a much more effective and efficient location encoding method as
compared to the fixed grid model because it avoids the danger of over
committing to artificial boundaries and its dimension is relatively low.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that, despite its
simplicity, this method achieves comparable or better results than
spatio-temporal pyramid.

arising as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson for the spontaneous breaking of scale
symmetry in walking technicolor. One interesting candidate for the walking
technicolor is the QCD with the large number of fermion flavors, involving the
one-family model having the eight-fermion flavors. The smallness of the
technidilaton mass can be ensured by the generic walking feature, Miransky
scaling, and the presence of the ""anti-Veneziano limit"" characteristic to the
large-flavor walking scenario. To tell the standard-model Higgs from the
technidilaton, one needs to wait for the precise estimate of the Higgs
couplings to the standard model particles, which is expected at the ongoing
LHC-Run II. In this talk the technidilaton phenomenology in comparison with the
LHC Run-I data is summarized with the special emphasis placed on the presence
of the anti-Veneziano limit supporting the lightness of technidilaton. Besides
the technidilaton, the walking technicolor predicts the rich particle spectrum

fundamental problem in signal processing. It has diverse applications in fields
ranging from hyperspectral imaging to denoising biomedical sensors. This paper
focuses on in-silico deconvolution of signals associated with complex tissues
into their constitutive cell-type specific components, along with a
quantitative characterization of the cell-types. Deconvolving mixed
tissues/cell-types is useful in the removal of contaminants (e.g., surrounding
cells) from tumor biopsies, as well as in monitoring changes in the cell
population in response to treatment or infection. In these contexts, the
observed signal from the mixture of cell-types is assumed to be a linear
combination of the expression levels of genes in constitutive cell-types. The
goal is to use known signals corresponding to individual cell-types along with
a model of the mixing process to cast the deconvolution problem as a suitable
optimization problem.
  In this paper, we present a survey of models, methods, and assumptions
underlying deconvolution techniques. We investigate the choice of the different
loss functions for evaluating estimation error, constraints on solutions,
preprocessing and data filtering, feature selection, and regularization to
enhance the quality of solutions, along with the impact of these choices on the
performance of regression-based methods for deconvolution. We assess different
combinations of these factors and use detailed statistical measures to evaluate
their effectiveness. We identify shortcomings of current methods and avenues
for further investigation. For many of the identified shortcomings, such as
normalization issues and data filtering, we provide new solutions. We summarize
our findings in a prescriptive step-by-step process, which can be applied to a
wide range of deconvolution problems.

failure probability less than $1/n^c$ (for any constant $c$ we choose), our
solution has worst case running time $O(\log^3 n)$ per edge insertion,
$O(\log^4 n)$ per edge deletion, and $O(\log n/\log\log n)$ per query, where
$n$ is the number of vertices. The previous best algorithm has worst case
running time $O(\log^4 n)$ per edge insertion and $O(\log^5 n)$ per edge

number depending on the distribution of eigenvalues. Both of these algorithms
use hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) matrices to approximate some
intermediate eigenvector matrices which are Cauchy-like matrices and are
off-diagonally low-rank. The difference of these two versions lies in using
different HSS construction algorithms, one (denoted by {ADC1}) uses a
structured low-rank approximation method and the other ({ADC2}) uses a
randomized HSS construction algorithm. For the ADC2 algorithm, a method is
proposed to estimate the off-diagonal rank. Numerous experiments have been done
to show their stability and efficiency. These algorithms are implemented in
parallel in a shared memory environment, and some parallel implementation
details are included. Comparing the ADCs with highly optimized multithreaded
libraries such as Intel MKL, we find that ADCs could be more than 6x times
faster for some large matrices with few deflations.

quiescent galaxies in our intermediate redshift sample are compact. After
accounting for important selection and systematic effects, the velocity
dispersion distribution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts is similar to
galaxies in the local universe. Galaxies at $z<0.6$ appear to be smaller

investigators to consider generalized approaches to defining an entropy
function. New insights are achieved by defining the average uncertainty in the
probability domain as a transformation of entropy functions. The Shannon
entropy when transformed to the probability domain is the weighted geometric
mean of the probabilities. For the exponential and Gaussian distributions, we
show that the weighted geometric mean of the distribution is equal to the
density of the distribution at the location plus the scale, i.e. at the width
of the distribution. The average uncertainty is generalized via the weighted
generalized mean, in which the moment is a function of the nonlinear source.
Both the Renyi and Tsallis entropies transform to this definition of the
generalized average uncertainty in the probability domain. For the generalized
Pareto and Student's t-distributions, which are the maximum entropy
distributions for these generalized entropies, the appropriate weighted
generalized mean also equals the density of the distribution at the location
plus scale. A coupled entropy function is proposed, which is equal to the
normalized Tsallis entropy divided by one plus the coupling.

`naturalness' in the Universe. Namely, two ratios of order unity. (1) The
combination of the stellar mass scale, M*, with the Planck mass, MPl, and the
Chandrasekhar mass leads to a ratio of order unity that reads
NPl*=MPl/[(M*)(mp)^2]^{1/3}=0.15-3, where mp is the proton mass. (2) A system
with a dynamical time equals to the nuclear life times of stars, tau, has a
density of rhoD = 1/[(G)(tau)^2]. The ratio of the dark energy density to this
density is NL*=rhoL/rhoD=10^{-7} - 10^{5}$. Although the range is large, it is
critically much smaller than the 123 orders of magnitude usually referred to
when rhoL is compered to the Planck density. In the pure fundamental particles
domain there is no naturalness; either naturalness does not exist or there is a
need for a new physics or new particles. The `Astrophysical Naturalness' offers
a third possibility: stars introduce the combinations of, or relations among,
known fundamental quantities that lead to naturalness.
