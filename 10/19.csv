  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A sequence number checking technique is proposed to improve the performance
of TCP connections in mobile ad hoc networks. While a TCP connection is
initialized, a routing protocol takes the responsibility for checking the hop
count between a source and destination pair. If the hop count is greater than a
predefined value, the routing protocol decides to use a proxy node. The
responsibility of a proxy node is to check the correctness of data packets and
inform the missing packets by sending an acknowledgement from a proxy node to
the source node. By doing so, the source node is able to retransmit any missing
packet in advance without waiting until an end-to-end acknowledgement is
received from the destination. Simulation results show that the proposed
mechanism is able to increase throughput up to 55% in static network and
decrease routing overhead up to 95% in mobile network.

dynamical spherically-symmetric black holes (BHs). However, they become
problematic in long-time simulations: Along the event horizon, the truncation
error grows exponentially in the outgoing Eddington null coordinate - which we
denote $v_e$ - and runs out of control for a sufficiently long interval of
$v_e$. This problem, if not properly addressed, would destroy the numerics both
inside and outside the black hole at late times (i.e. large $v_e$). In this
paper we explore the origin of this problem, and propose a resolution based on
adaptive gauge for the ingoing null coordinate $u$. This resolves the problem
outside the BH - and also inside the BH, if the latter is uncharged. However,
in the case of a charged BH, an analogous large-$v_e$ numerical problem occurs
at the inner horizon. We thus generalize our adaptive-gauge method in order to
overcome the IH problem as well. This improved adaptive gauge, to which we
refer as the maximal-$\sigma$ gauge, allows long-$v$ double-null numerical
simulation across both the event horizon and the (outgoing) inner horizon, and
up to the vicinity of the spacelike $r=0$ singularity. We conclude by
presenting a few numerical results deep inside a perturbed charged BH, in the
vicinity of the contracting Cauchy Horizon.

rigid body motion, using the framework of geometric mechanics. Rigorous
stability analyses of the estimation schemes presented here guarantee the
nonlinear stability of these schemes. The stability of these schemes does not
depend on the characteristics of the sensor measurement noise or external
disturbances. In addition, they are robust to initial errors in the state
estimates and do not need to be re-tuned when sensor noise properties change.
In the first part of this dissertation, estimation of rigid body states is
considered, given the dynamics model of the rigid body. In the second part, an
estimation scheme that does not require knowledge of the dynamics of the rigid
body is derived, based on onboard sensor measurements obtained at an
appropriate frequency. The frequency of such measurements must be suitably high
to resolve the motion of the rigid body. These attitude and pose estimation
schemes are obtained by applying the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle from
variational mechanics, to a Lagrangian constructed from state estimation errors
and a dissipative term linear in the velocity estimation errors.

of monolithic elements of ice or rock bound by gravity. Voids occupy a
significant fraction of the volume of a rubble pile. They can exist up to
pressure $P\approx \epsy\mu$, where $\epsy$ is the monolithic material's yield
strain and $\mu$ its rigidity. At low $P$, contacts between neighboring
elements are confined to a small fraction of their surface areas. As a result,
the effective thermal conductivity of a rubble pile, $\kcon\approx
k(P/(\epsy\mu))^{1/2}$, can be orders of magnitude smaller than, $k$, the
thermal conductivity of its monolithic elements. In a fluid-free environment,
only radiation can transfer energy across voids. It contributes an additional
component, $\krad=16\ell\sigma T^3/3$, to the total effective conductivity,
$\keff=\kcon +\krad$. Here $\ell$, the inverse of the opacity per unit volume,
is of order the size of the elements and voids. An important distinction
between $\kcon$ and $\krad$ is that the former is independent of the size of
the elements whereas the latter is proportional to it. Our expression for
$\keff$ provides a good fit to the depth dependence of thermal conductivity in
the top $140\,\mathrm{cm}$ of the lunar regolith. It also offers a good
starting point for detailed modeling of thermal inertias for asteroids and
satellites. Measurement of the response of surface temperature to variable
insolation is a valuable diagnostic of a regolith. There is an opportunity for
careful experiments under controlled laboratory conditions to test models of
thermal conductivity such as the one we outline.

are not permanent, but are characterized by temporal changes that are observed
along with abiotic and biotic variations. While work has been done describing
and quantifying these changes, little is known about their consequences for
species coexistence. Here, we investigate the extent to which changes of
species composition impacts the likelihood of persistence of the predator-prey
community in the highly seasonal Bialowieza Primeval Forest (NE Poland), and
the extent to which seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet)
modulate the expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent
developments on the study of structural stability in ecological communities. We
find that the observed species turnover strongly varies the likelihood of
community persistence between summer and winter. Importantly, we demonstrate
that the observed seasonal interaction changes minimize the variation in the
likelihood of persistence associated with species turnover across the year. We
find that these community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of
individual species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in
persistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our results
provide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species interactions, and
suggest that monitoring the association of interactions changes with the level
of variation in community dynamics can provide a good indicator of the response
of species to environmental pressures.

anisotropy and both stars and dark matter to explore the conditions that give
rise to the early-type galaxy scaling relations referred to as the Fundamental
Plane (FP) and Manifold (FM). The modelled scaling relations generally match
the observed relations and are remarkably robust to all changes allowed within
these models. The empirical relationships can fail beyond the parameter ranges
where they were calibrated and we discuss the nature of those failures. Because
the location of individual models relative to the FP and FM is sensitive to the
adopted physical scaling of the models, unconstrained rescaling produces a much
larger scatter about the scaling relations than that observed. We conclude that
only certain combinations of scaling values, which define the physical radial
and kinematic scale of the model, produce low scatter versions of the FP and
FM. These combinations further result in reproducing a condition observed
previously for galaxies, $r_c \rho_0 = $ constant, where $r_c$ is the scaling
radius and $\rho_0$ is the central density. As such, we conclude that this
empirical finding and global galaxy scaling relations are not independent and
that finding the physical cause of one should lead to the solution to the
other. Although our models are strictly for pressure supported galaxies, these
results may well hold generally because the central density constraint was
first identified in dwarf spheroidals but later extended to rotating giant
galaxies and the FM applies to galaxies of any morphological type and
luminosity class.

holonomic controlled two-qubit entangling gates, and thus provides a promising
procedure to maintain entanglement in charge qubits and a pathway toward
fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. We estimate the feasibility of

  B-Splines and Applications to Shape Constrained Estimation",,,,,"math.CA math.OC math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by shape constrained estimation under general nonnegative derivative
constraints, this paper considers the B-spline approximation of constrained
functions and studies the asymptotic performance of the constrained B-spline
estimator. By invoking a deep result in B-spline theory (known as de Boor's
conjecture) first proved by A. Shardin as well as other new analytic
techniques, we establish a critical uniform Lipschitz property of the B-spline
estimator subject to arbitrary nonnegative derivative constraints under the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with possibly non-equally spaced design points and knots.
This property leads to important asymptotic analysis results of the B-spline
estimator, e.g., the uniform convergence and consistency on the entire interval
under consideration. The results developed in this paper not only recover the
well-studied monotone and convex approximation and estimation as special cases,
but also treat general nonnegative derivative constraints in a unified
framework and open the door for the constrained B-spline approximation and
estimation subject to a broader class of shape constraints.

increasing availability of large-scale heterogenous datasets capturing online
user interactions and behaviors. Traditional analysis of techno-social systems
data has focused mainly on describing either the dynamics of social
interactions, or the attributes and behaviors of the users. However,
overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that the two dimensions affect one
another, and therefore they should be jointly modeled and analyzed in a
multi-modal framework. The benefits of such an approach include the ability to
build better predictive models, leveraging social network information as well
as user behavioral signals. To this purpose, here we propose the Constrained
Latent Space Model (CLSM), a generalized framework that combines Mixed
Membership Stochastic Blockmodels (MMSB) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
incorporating a constraint that forces the latent space to concurrently
describe the multiple data modalities. We derive an efficient inference
algorithm based on Variational Expectation Maximization that has a
computational cost linear in the size of the network, thus making it feasible
to analyze massive social datasets. We validate the proposed framework on two
problems: prediction of social interactions from user attributes and behaviors,
and behavior prediction exploiting network information. We perform experiments
with a variety of multi-modal social systems, spanning location-based social
networks (Gowalla), social media services (Instagram, Orkut), e-commerce and
review sites (Amazon, Ciao), and finally citation networks (Cora). The results
indicate significant improvement in prediction accuracy over state of the art

Haramaty and Shpilka [STOC 2010] showed that biased degree three or four
polynomials admit a strong structural property. We confirm that this is the
case for degree five polynomials also. Let $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_q$ be a prime
field.
  [1.] Suppose $f:\mathbb{F}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ is a degree five
polynomial with bias(f)=\delta. Then f can be written in the form $f=
\sum_{i=1}^{c} G_i H_i + Q$, where $G_i$ and $H_i$s are nonconstant polynomials
satisfying $deg(G_i)+deg(H_i)\leq 5$ and $Q$ is a degree $\leq 4$ polynomial.
Moreover, $c=c(\delta)$ does not depend on $n$ and $q$.
  [2.] Suppose $f:\mathbb{F}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ is a degree five
polynomial with $bias(f)=\delta$. Then there exists an $\Omega_\delta(n)$
dimensional affine subspace $V$ of $\mathbb{F}^n$ such that $f$ restricted to
$V$ is a constant.
  Cohen and Tal [Random 2015] proved that biased polynomials of degree at most
four are constant on a subspace of dimension $\Omega(n)$. Item [2.] extends
this to degree five polynomials. A corollary to Item [2.] is that any degree
five affine disperser for dimension $k$ is also an affine extractor for
dimension $O(k)$. We note that Item [2.] cannot hold for degrees six or higher.
  We obtain our results for degree five polynomials as a special case of
structure theorems that we prove for biased degree d polynomials when
$d<|\mathbb{F}|+4$. While the $d<|\mathbb{F}|+4$ assumption seems very
restrictive, we note that prior to our work such structure theorems were only
known for $d<|\mathbb{F}|$ by Green and Tao [Contrib. Discrete Math. 2009] and
Bhowmick and Lovett [arXiv:1506.02047]. Using algorithmic regularity lemmas for
polynomials developed by Bhattacharyya, et. al. [SODA 2015], we show that
whenever such a strong structure exists, it can be found algorithmically in
time polynomial in n.

optimize. In practice, however, clustering is being routinely carried out. One
approach for providing theoretical understanding of this seeming discrepancy is
to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically
interesting input data from worst-case data sets. The hope is that there will
be clustering algorithms that are provably efficient on such ""clusterable""
instances. This paper addresses the thesis that the computational hardness of
clustering tasks goes away for inputs that one really cares about. In other
words, that ""Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter"" (the
\emph{CDNM thesis} for short).
  I wish to present a a critical bird's eye overview of the results published
on this issue so far and to call attention to the gap between available and
desirable results on this issue. A longer, more detailed version of this note
is available as arXiv:1507.05307.
  I discuss which requirements should be met in order to provide formal support
to the the CDNM thesis and then examine existing results in view of these
requirements and list some significant unsolved research challenges in that
direction.

coordinator nodes, distributed in the network area, periodically schedule
contention-free time slots for all data transmissions/receptions in the
network, based on transmission requests from source nodes. Adjacent
coordinators exchange scheduling information to effectively increase spatial
spectrum reuse and avoid transmission collisions. Moreover, the proposed MAC
scheme allows a node to put its radio interface into a sleep mode when it is
not transmitting/receiving a packet, in order to reduce energy consumption.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves substantially
higher throughput and has significantly lower energy consumption in comparison

Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of electrically conducting fluids in presence of
external horizontal magnetic field. Three dimensional direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of the governing equations are performed for the
investigation. DNS shows that oscillatory instability is inhibited by the
magnetic field. The supercritical Rayleigh number for the onset of oscillation
is found to scale with the Chandrasekhar number $\mathrm{Q}$ as
$\mathrm{Q}^{\alpha}$ in DNS with $\alpha = 1.8$ for low Prandtl numbers
($\mathrm{Pr}$). Most interestingly, DNS shows $\mathrm{Q}$ dependent routes to
chaos for low Prandtl number fluids like mercury ($\mathrm{Pr} = 0.025$). For
low $\mathrm{Q}$, period doubling routes are observed, while, quasiperiodic
routes are observed for high $\mathrm{Q}$. The bifurcation structure associated
with $\mathrm{Q}$ dependent routes to chaos is then understood by constructing
a low dimensional model from the DNS data. The model also shows similar scaling
laws as DNS. Bifurcation analysis of the low dimensional model shows that
origin of different routes are associated with the bifurcation structure near
the primary instability. These observations show similarity with the previous
results of convection experiments performed with mercury.

absent. The absorbers toward Q0230-0334 and Q1418+0718 show potential

better understanding of how environment affects the gas content of galaxies, we
identified a sample of six HI-deficient galaxies from the HI Parkes All Sky

disks. We conclude that both ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions are
important gas removal mechanisms in low density environments.

the imaginary-time evolution. The algorithm follows the framework of the
quantum transfer matrix and finite-temperature Lanczos methods, but we extends
them to treat much larger system sizes without the negative sign problem by
optimizing the truncated Hilbert space on the basis of the time-dependent

stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method that has been frequently used for the
ground state to optimally truncate the Hilbert space. The obtained
finite-temperature states allow an interpretation based on the thermal pure

formation, internal structure, and longevity have not been studied in detail.
We report the results from a comprehensive numerical study that investigates
the characteristics, formation, and evolution of filaments arising from
magnetohydrodynamic interactions between supersonic winds and dense clouds.
Here we improve on previous simulations by utilising sharper density contrasts
and higher numerical resolutions. By following multiple density tracers, we
find that material in the envelopes of the clouds is removed and deposited
downstream to form filamentary tails, while the cores of the clouds serve as
footpoints and late-stage outer layers of these tails. Aspect ratios >12,
subsonic velocity dispersions ~0.1-0.3 of the wind sound speed, and magnetic
field amplifications ~100 are found to be characteristic of these filaments. We
also report the effects of different magnetic field strengths and orientations.
The magnetic field strength regulates vorticity production: sinuous filamentary
towers arise in non-magnetic environments, while strong magnetic fields inhibit
small-scale perturbations at boundary layers making tails less turbulent.
Magnetic field components aligned with the direction of the flow favour the
formation of pressure-confined flux ropes inside the tails, whilst transverse
components tend to form current sheets. Softening the equation of state to
nearly isothermal leads to suppression of dynamical instabilities and further
collimation of the tail. Towards the final stages of the evolution, we find
that small cloudlets and distorted filaments survive the break-up of the clouds
and become entrained in the winds, reaching velocities ~0.1 of the wind speed.

In this work, we investigate one more constraining relationship between the
cutoff energy and the phase lag during the early stages of an X-ray outburst of
the black-hole X-ray binary GX 339-4: the cutoff energy decreases while the
phase lag increases during the brightening of the hard state. We demonstrate
that our jet model naturally explains the above correlation, with a minor
modification consisting of introducing an acceleration zone at the base of the
jet. The observed correlation between the cutoff energy and the phase lag
suggests that the lags are produced by the hard component. Here we show that
this correlation arises naturally if Comptonization in the jet produces these
two quantities.

deplete in a uniform way and complete area remain covered by sensor nodes.

characterized by the rotation tensor, obtained from the polar decomposition of
the deformation gradient. Beyond its well-known merits, the polar rotation
tensor also has a lesser known dynamical inconsistency: it does not satisfy the
fundamental superposition principle of rigid-body rotations over adjacent time
intervals. As a consequence, the polar rotation diverts from the observed mean
material rotation of fibers in fluids, and introduces a purely kinematic memory
effect into computed material rotation. Here we derive a generalized polar
decomposition for linear processes that yields a unique, dynamically consistent
rotation component, the dynamic rotation tensor, for the deformation gradient.
The left dynamic stretch tensor is objective, and shares the principal strain
values and axes with its classic polar counterpart. Unlike its classic polar
counterpart, however, the dynamic stretch tensor evolves in time without spin.
The dynamic rotation tensor further decomposes into a spatially constant mean
rotation tensor and a dynamically consistent relative rotation tensor that is
objective for planar deformations. We also obtain simple expressions for
dynamic analogues of Cauchy's mean rotation angle that characterize a deforming
body objectively.

superconductors, however, its microscopic origin remains debated. Within the
framework of the fermion-spin theory, the nature of charge order in the
pseudogap phase and its evolution with doping are studied by taking into
account the electron self-energy (then the pseudogap) effect. It is shown that
the antinodal region of the electron Fermi surface is suppressed by the
electron self-energy, and then the low-energy electron excitations occupy the
disconnected Fermi arcs located around the nodal region. In particular, the
charge-order state is driven by the Fermi-arc instability, with a
characteristic wave vector corresponding to the hot spots of the Fermi arcs
rather than the antinodal nesting vector. Moreover, although the Fermi arc
increases its length as a function of doping, the charge-order wave vector
reduces almost linearity with the increase of doping. The theory also indicates
that the Fermi arc, charge order, and pseudogap in cuprate superconductors are
intimately related each other, and all of them emanates from the electron
self-energy due to the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin
excitations.

covering the 4500 to 5800 \AA{} wavelength range, were obtained using the
FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph attached to the ESO Very Large Telescopes (VLT). We
determined the atmospheric parameters using calibrations of the Geneva
photometry and by adjusting the $H_{\beta}$ profiles to synthetic ones. The
abundances of up to 20 chemical elements, were derived for 19 late B, 16 A and
9 F stars by iteratively adjusting synthetic spectra to the observations. We
also derived a mean cluster metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]=0.07\pm0.03}$ dex
from the iron abundances of the F-type stars. We find that, for most chemical
elements, the normal late B and A-type stars exhibit larger star-to-star
abundance variations than the F-type stars do probably because of the faster
rotation of the B and A stars. The abundances of C, O, Mg, Si and Sc appear to
be anticorrelated to that of Fe, while the opposite holds for the abundances of
Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Y, and Ba about as expected if radiative diffusion is
efficient in the envelopes of these stars. In the course of this analysis, we
discovered five new peculiar stars: one mild-Am, one Am, and one Fm star (HD

most likely a SB2. We performed a detailed modelling of HD 318101,the new
He-weak P-rich CP star, using the Montr\'eal stellar evolution code XEVOL which
treats self-consistently all particle transport processes. Although the overall
abundance pattern of this star is properly reproduced, we find that detailed

radiative magnetic reconnection, i.e., a reconnection regime where radiation
reaction influences reconnection dynamics, energetics, and nonthermal particle
acceleration. This influence be may be manifested via a number of
astrophysically important radiative effects, such as radiation-reaction limits
on particle acceleration, radiative cooling, radiative resistivity, braking of
reconnection outflows by radiation drag, radiation pressure, viscosity, and
even pair creation at highest energy densities. Self-consistent inclusion of
these effects in magnetic reconnection theory and modeling calls for serious
modifications to our overall theoretical approach to the problem. In addition,
prompt reconnection-powered radiation often represents our only observational
diagnostic tool for studying remote astrophysical systems; this underscores the
importance of developing predictive modeling capabilities to connect the
underlying physical conditions in a reconnecting system to observable radiative
signatures. This Chapter gives an overview of recent theoretical progress in
developing basic physical understanding of radiative reconnection, with a
special emphasis on astrophysically important radiation mechanisms like
synchrotron, curvature, and inverse-Compton. It also offers a broad review of
key high-energy astrophysical applications of radiative reconnection, such as:
pulsar wind nebulae and magnetospheres, accreting black-hole coronae and jets
in XRBs and AGN, magnetospheres of magnetars, and Gamma-Ray Bursts. Finally,
this Chapter discusses the most critical open questions and outlines the

analyzed. Spectrophotometric data of 11 PNe and two H II regions were obtained
with the OSIRIS spectrograph attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Data for
other 13 PNe and three H II regions were retrieved from the literature.
Physical conditions and chemical abundances of O, N, Ne, Ar and S were derived
for 19 PNe and 4 H II regions. Abundances in the PNe sample are widely
distributed showing 12+log(O/H) from 7.4 to 8.2 and 12+log(Ar/H) from 4.97 to
5.80. Two groups of PNe can be differentiated: one old, with low metallicity
(12+log(O/H)<8.0 and 12+log(Ar/H)<5.7) and another younger with metallicities
similar to the values of H II regions. The old objects are distributed in a
larger volume than the young ones. An important fraction of PNe (>30%) was
found to be highly N-rich (Type I PNe). Such PNe occur at any metallicity. In
addition, about 60% of the sample presents high ionization (He++/He >= 0.1),
possessing a central star with effective temperature larger than 10^6 K.
Possible biases in the sample are discussed. From comparison with stellar
evolution models by A. Karakas's group of the observed N/O abundance ratios,
our PNe should have had initial masses lower than 4 M_sun, although if the
comparison is made with Ne vs. O abundances, the initial masses should have
been lower than 2 M_sun. It appears that these models of stars of 2-3 M_sun are
producing too much 22Ne in the stellar surface at the end of the AGB. On the
other hand, the comparison with another set of stellar evolution models by P.
Ventura's group with a different treatment of convection and on the assumptions
concerning the overshoot of the convective core during the core H-burning
phase, provided a reasonable agreement between N/O and Ne/H observed and
predicted ratios if initial masses of more massive stars are of about 4 M_sun.

Medium resolution spectra have been used to determine the detailed chemical
composition of their atmosphere. We performed a standard 1D LTE analysis to

  Considering all the stars as representative of the same population of low

metallicity of the star increases in a way similar to what is found for the
population of stars belonging to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The main difference
is that the solar [alpha/Fe] is reached at a much lower metallicity for the
UfDSph than the dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
  We report for the first time the abundance of strontium in CVnI. The star we
analyzed in this galaxy has a very high [Sr/Fe] and a very low upper limit of
barium which makes it a star with an exceptionally high [Sr/Ba] ratio.
  Our results seem to indicate that the galaxies which have produced the bulk
of their stars before the reionization (fossil galaxies) have lower [X/Fe]
ratios at a given metallicity than the galaxies that have experienced a
discontinuity in their star formation rate (quenching).

$\Sigma^0 n^{m}=n^m$, and then recursively by $\Sigma^{r+1} n^{m}=\Sigma^{r}
1^{m}+\Sigma^{r} 2^{m}+\ldots + \Sigma^{r} n^{m}$. During the early
17th-century, polynomial expressions for the sums $\Sigma^r n^m$ and their
factorisation and polynomial basis representation properties were examined by
Johann Faulhaber, who published some remarkable theorems relating to these
$r$-fold sums in his Academia Algebrae (1631).
  In this paper we consider families of polynomials related to the Fibonacci
and Lucas polynomials which naturally lend themselves to representing sums and
differences of integer powers, as well as $\Sigma^r n^m$. Using summations over
polynomial basis representations for monomials we generalise this sum for any
polynomial $q(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$, encountering some interesting coefficient
families in the process. Other results include using our polynomial expressions
to state some theorems of Fermat, where in particular, we obtain an explicit
expression for the quotient in Fermat's Little Theorem.
  In the final two sections we examine these sums in the context of the three
pairs of Stirling number varieties and binomial decompositions. We also derive
an expression for $\Sigma n^m$ in terms of the Stirling numbers and Pochhammer
symbols, leading to a seemingly new relation between the Stirling numbers and
the Bernoulli numbers.

revealed that at low temperature the tunneling-induced surface charging with
holes reduces the energy barrier for the flipping of buckled dimers, thereby
giving rise to a sizable QT-driven frequency of the flip-flop motion. However,
such a QT phenomenon becomes marginal in the tunneling-induced surface charging

including 5 O-stars. The radial velocities of all target stars are in agreement
with their Sextans A membership, although three of them show significant
deviations. We determined the stellar parameters of the O-type stars using the
stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND, and revisited the sub-SMC temperature scale.
Two of the O-stars are consistent with relatively strong winds and enhanced
helium abundances, although results are not conclusive. We discuss the position
of the OB stars in the HRD. Initial stellar masses run from slightly below 20
up to 40 solar masses.
  The target selection method worked well for Sextans A, confirming the
procedure developed in Garcia \& Herrero (2013). The stellar temperatures are
consistent with findings in other galaxies. Some of the targets deserve
follow-up spectroscopy because of indications of a runaway nature, an enhanced
helium abundance or a relatively strong wind. We observe a correlation between
HI and OB associations similar to the irregular galaxy IC1613, confirming the

prototypical example is VO2, where previous studies indicated that the MIT
resistance change correlate with changes in carrier density and mobility. We
studied the MIT using Hall measurements with unprecedented resolution and
accuracy, simultaneously with resistance measurements. Contrast to prior
reports, we find that the MIT is not correlated with a change in mobility, but
rather, is a macroscopic manifestation of the spatial phase separation which
accompanies the MIT. Our results demonstrate that, surprisingly, properties of
the nano-scale spatially-separated metallic and semiconducting domains actually
retain their bulk properties. This study highlights the importance of taking
into account local fluctuations and correlations when interpreting transport
measurements in highly correlated systems.

two 50 $\mu$m thick single crystal CVD diamonds, stacked to form a ""sandwich""

14 MeV neutrons, impinging on one diamond, into $\alpha$ particles which were
detected in the second diamond in coincidence with nuclear recoil. For

gives access to the initial neutron energy value. The measured 14 MeV neutron
detection sensitivity through this reaction by a detector of effective area
3$\times$3 mm$^2$ was $5\times 10^{-7}$ counts cm$^2$/n. This value is in good

secondary ultraviolet (UV) field in cold and dense molecular clouds. UV photons
induce photochemistry and desorption of ice molecules. Experimental simulations
dedicated to ice analogs under astrophysically relevant conditions are needed
to understand these processes. We present UV-irradiation experiments of a pure
CO2 ice analog. Calibration of the QMS allowed us to quantify the
photodesorption of molecules to the gas phase. This information was added to
the data provided by the FTIR on the solid phase to obtain a complete
quantitative study of the UV photoprocessing of an ice analog. Experimental
simulations were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Ice samples were
deposited onto an infrared transparent window at 8K and were subsequently
irradiated with a microwave-discharged hydrogen flow lamp. After irradiation,
ice samples were warmed up until complete sublimation was attained. Photolysis
of CO2 molecules initiates a network of photon-induced chemical reactions
leading to the formation of CO, CO3 ,O2 , and O3 . During irradiation,
photon-induced desorption of CO and, to a lesser extent, O2 and CO2 took place
through a process called indirect desorption induced by electronic transitions
(DIET), with maximum photodesorption yields (Ypd) of 1.2 x 10-2
molecules/incident photon , 9.3 x 10-4 molecules/incident photon , and 1.1 x
10-4 molecules/incident photon , respectively. Calibration of mass
spectrometers allows a direct quantification of photodesorption yields instead
of the indirect values that were obtained from infrared spectra in most
previous works. Supplementary information provided by infrared spectroscopy
leads to a complete quantification, and therefore a better understanding, of
the processes taking place in UV-irradiated ice mantles.

changes the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the disk in
significant ways. To properly interpret observations of protoplanetary disks
and to place these observations in the context of the first steps of planet
formation, it is crucial to understand the optical properties of these complex
structures. We derive the optical properties of dust aggregates using detailed
computations of aggregate structures and compare these computa- tionally
demanding results with approximate methods that are cheaper to compute in
practice. In this way we wish to understand the merits and problems of
approximate methods and define the context in which they can or cannot be used
to analyze observations of objects where significant grain growth is taking
place. For the detailed computations we used the discrete dipole approximation
(DDA), a method able to compute the interaction of light with a complexly
shaped, inhomogeneous particle. We compared the results to those obtained using
spherical and irregular, homogeneous and inhomogeneous particles. While no
approximate method properly reproduces all characteristics of large dust
aggregates, the thermal properties of dust can be analyzed using irregularly
shaped, porous, inhomogeneous grains. The asymmetry of the scattering phase
function is a good indicator of aggregate size, while the degree of
polarization is probably determined by the size of the constituent particles.
Optical properties derived from aggregates significantly differ from the most
frequently used standard (""astronomical silicate"" in spherical grains). We
outline a computationally fast and relatively accurate method that can be used

requires a reconstruction in time for which we present a very general framework
first for odes and then apply the approach to conservation laws. The
reconstruction does not depend on the actual method used for evolving the
solution in time. Most importantly it covers in addition to implicit methods
also the wide range of explicit methods typically used to solve conservation
laws. For the spatial discretization, we allow for standard choices of
numerical fluxes. We use reconstructions of the discrete solution together with
the relative entropy stability framework, which leads to error control in the
case of smooth solutions. We study under which conditions on the numerical flux
the estimate is of optimal order pre-shock. While the estimator we derive is

their connections to other fields of mathematics, computer science, and

a unifying interpretation that relates a vast array of combinatorial
structures. In this paper, we introduce the notion of patterns in inversion
sequences. A sequence $(e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n)$ is an inversion sequence if $0
\leq e_i<i$ for all $i \in [n]$. Inversion sequences of length $n$ are in
bijection with permutations of length $n$; an inversion sequence can be
obtained from any permutation $\pi=\pi_1\pi_2\ldots \pi_n$ by setting $e_i =
|\{j \ | \ j < i \ {\rm and} \ \pi_j > \pi_i \}|$. This correspondence makes it
a natural extension to study patterns in inversion sequences much in the same

of the weights of the graph and using the geodesic distance as a means of
distance measurement. We thus have defined a wavelet transform based on a graph

for swarms of robots: Given a swarm of $n$ indistinguishable, point shaped
robots on a two dimensional grid. Initially, the robots form a closed chain on
the grid and must keep this connectivity during the whole process of their
gathering. Connectivity means, that neighboring robots of the chain need to be
positioned at the same or neighboring points of the grid. In our model,
gathering means to keep shortening the chain until the robots are located
inside a $2\times 2$ subgrid. Our model is completely local (no global control,
no global coordinates, no compass, no global communication or vision, \ldots).
Each robot can only see its next constant number of left and right neighbors on
the chain. This fixed constant is called the \emph{viewing path length}. All
its operations and detections are restricted to this constant number of robots.
Other robots, even if located at neighboring or the same grid point cannot be
detected. Only based on the relative positions of its detectable chain
neighbors, a robot can decide to obtain a certain state. Based on this state
and their local knowledge, the robots do local modifications to the chain by
moving to neighboring grid points without breaking the chain. These
modifications are performed without the knowledge whether they lead to a global
progress or not. We assume the fully synchronous $\mathcal{FSYNC}$ model. For
this problem, we present a gathering algorithm which needs linear time. This
result generalizes the result from \cite{hopper}, where an open chain with
specified distinguishable (and fixed) endpoints is considered.

hot and dense medium of a quark gluon plasma (QGP). Under the assumption that
the medium is not static and homogeneous, knowledge about the temporal
evolution of the processes involved can be of essential importance. Therefore,
parton fragmentation has been studied with a Monte-Carlo algorithm that
approximates the DGLAP-evolution of fragmentation functions via a set of parton
cascades. The presented work consists mainly of implementations of this kind of
algorithm and the application of a simple approximation, which gives the time
development of partonic cascades. As approximations to the parton-splitting
processes of gluons and massless quarks in the vacuum two different schemes
with the same leading-log contributions are investigated. Furthermore, the
temporal evolutions of quantities related to partonic cascades have been
examined: To our understanding, especially variables (like, e.g.: parton
multiplicities or virtualities) that give insight, when parton splittings take
place, are of great interest, as they allow identifying the parts of the

following open problem from the book, Free Lattices, by R.Freese, J.Jezek, and
J.B. Nation published in 1995: ""Which lattices (and in particular which
countable lattices) are sublattices of a free lattice?""
  Despite partial progress over the decades, the problem is still unsolved.
There is emphasis on the countable case because the current body of knowledge
on sublattices of free lattices is most concentrated on when these sublattices
are countably infinite.
  It is known that sublattices of free lattices which are finite can be
characterized as being those lattices which satisfy Whitman's condition and are
semidistributive. This assertion was conjectured by B. Jonsson in the 1960's
and proven by J.B. Nation in 1980. However, there is a desire for a new proof
to this deep result as Nation's proof is very involved and more insight into
sublattices of free lattices is sought after.
  In this article, a sufficient condition involving a construct known as a join
minimal pair, or just a minimal pair, implying J'onsson's conjecture is proven.
Minimal pairs were first defined by H. Gaskill when analysing sharply
transferable lattices. Using this sufficient condition, research by I.Rival and
B.Sands is used to compare this condition with properties of finite
semidistributive lattices and in the process refute the main assertion of a
manuscript by H.Muhle. Moreover, inspired by the approaches used by Henri
Muhle, I will make a partial result which investigates a possible forbidden
sublattice characterization involving breadth-two planar semidistributive
lattices. To the best of my knowledge, the two results of this article (the
sufficient condition for Jonsson's conjecture and the partial result
aforementioned) are new.

addressing pair interactions on planar interfaces and culminating with
curvature capillary migration. Particular care is given to the solution of the
associated boundary value problems to determine the energies of interaction.
Experimental exploration of these interactions on planar and curved interfaces

view. A signed graph $(G,\Sigma)$ is a graph $G$ where each edge is given a
sign, positive or negative; $\Sigma\subseteq E(G)$ denotes the set of negative
edges. Thus, $(G, \Sigma)$ is a $2$-edge-coloured graph with the property that
the edge-colours, $\{+, -\}$, form a group under multiplication. Central to the
study of signed graphs is the operation of switching at a vertex, that results
in changing the sign of each incident edge. We study two types of homomorphisms
of a signed graph $(G,\Sigma)$ to a signed graph $(H,\Pi)$: ec-homomorphisms
and s-homomorphisms. Each is a standard graph homomorphism of $G$ to $H$ with
some additional constraint. In the former, edge-signs are preserved. In the
latter, edge-signs are preserved after the switching operation has been applied
to a subset of vertices of $G$.
  We prove a dichotomy theorem for s-homomorphism problems for a large class of
(fixed) target signed graphs $(H,\Pi)$. Specifically, as long as $(H,\Pi)$ does
not contain a negative (respectively a positive) loop, the problem is
polynomial-time solvable if the core of $(H,\Pi)$ has at most two edges, and is
NP-complete otherwise. (Note that this covers all simple signed graphs.) The
same dichotomy holds if $(H,\Pi)$ has no negative digons, and we conjecture
that it holds always. In our proofs, we reduce s-homomorphism problems to

some machines or the congestion of some roads is not known far enough in
advance, or if we have to regularly solve a problem over instances that are
largely similar, e.g., daily airport scheduling with few charter flights.
Unlike robust optimization, which also studies settings like this, our goal
lies not in computing solutions that are (approximately) good for every

speed up finding an optimal solution once the missing data is known.
  We present efficient algorithms that given an instance with partially
uncertain input generate an instance of size polynomial in the amount of
uncertain data that is equivalent for every instantiation of the unknown part.
Concretely, we obtain such algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree, Minimum Weight
Matroid Basis, and Maximum Cardinality Bipartite Maxing, where respectively the

zero-temperature, within the framework of dynamical mean-field theory, and for
general particle-hole asymmetry where a doping-induced Mott transition occurs.
Our primary focus is the Mott insulator (MI) phase, and our main aim to
establish what can be shown exactly about it. To handle the locally
doubly-degenerate MI requires two distinct self-energies, which reflect the
broken symmetry nature of the phase and together determine the standard single
self-energy. Exact results are obtained for the local charge, local magnetic
moment and associated spin susceptibilities, the interaction-renormalised
levels, and the low-energy behaviour of the self-energy in the MI phase. The
metallic phase is also considered briefly, and shown to acquire an emergent
particle-hole symmetry as the Mott transition is approached. Throughout the
metal, Luttinger's theorem is reflected in the vanishing of the Luttinger
integral; for the generic MI by contrast this is shown to be non-vanishing, but
again to have a universal magnitude. Numerical results are also obtained using
NRG, for the metal/MI phase boundary, the scaling behaviour of the charge as
the Mott transition is aproached from the metal, and associated universal
scaling of single-particle dynamics as the low-energy Kondo scale vanishes.

dielectric surfaces and/or plasmas located on or near the inner surface of a
thin-wall hollow dielectric tube. Three frequencies were employed to improve
the data handling rate and the signal-to-noise. The test and performance

MIMO system emits in the environment, due to its power amplifiers (modeled by a

expression for the continuous-time cross-correlation of the transmit signals.
At a random spatial point, the same power is received at any frequency on
average with a MIMO base station as with a SISO base station when the two
radiate the same amount of power. For a specific channel realization however,
the received power depends on the channel. We show that the power received
out-of-band only deviates little from the average in a MIMO system with
multiple users and that the deviation can be significant with only one user.
Using an ergodicity argument, we conclude that out-of-band radiation is less of
a problem in massive MIMO, where total radiated power is lower compared to SISO
systems and that requirements on spectral regrowth can be relaxed in MIMO
systems without causing more total out-of-band radiation.

useful concentration inequalities for sparse subgaussian random vectors in two

independent subgaussian components, and $\xi =(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m) \in \{0,
1\}^m$ be independent Bernoulli random variables. We prove the large deviation
bound for a sparse quadratic form of $(X \circ \xi)^T A (X \circ \xi)$, where
$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is an $m \times m$ matrix, and random vector $X
\circ \xi$ denotes the Hadamard product of an isotropic subgaussian random
vector $X \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and a random vector $\xi \in \{0, 1\}^m$ such that
$(X \circ \xi)_{i} = X_{i} \xi_i$, where $\xi_1, \ldots,\xi_m$ are independent
Bernoulli random variables. The second type of sparsity in a quadratic form
comes from the setting where we randomly sample the elements of an anisotropic
subgaussian vector $Y = H X$ where $H \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ is an $m

$\ell_2$-norm of $D_{\xi} Y$ from its expected value, where for a given vector

correlation of systems. In wave physics, disordered potentials suppress wave
transport due to their localized eigenstates from random-walk scattering.
Although the variation of localization with tunable disorder has been
intensively studied as a bridge between ordered and disordered media, the
general trend of disorder-enhanced localization has remained unchanged, failing
in envisaging the existence of delocalization in highly-disordered potentials.
Here, we propose the concept of 'metadisorder': tunable random-walk systems
having a designed eigenstate with unnatural localization. We demonstrate that
one of the eigenstates in a randomly-coupled system can always be arbitrarily
molded, regardless of the degree of disorder, by adjusting the self-energy of
each element. Ordered waves are then achieved in highly-disordered systems,
including planewaves and globally- collective resonances. We also devise
counterintuitive functionalities in disordered systems, such as
'small-world-like' transport from non-Anderson-type localization,
phase-conserving disorder, and phase-controlled beam steering.

programming, refinement calculi have been tied to pointwise expression in terms
of state variables, with the curious exception of the ubiquitous but invisible
heap. To integrate pointwise with point-free, de Moor and Gibbons extended
lambda calculus with non-injective pattern matching interpreted using
relations. This article gives a semantics of that language using ``ideal
relations'' between partial orders, and a second semantics using predicate
transformers. The second semantics is motivated by its potential use with
separation algebra, for pattern matching in programs acting on the heap. Laws
including lax beta and eta are proved in these models and a number of open
problems are posed.

the relevant models by computer simulations is computationally demanding.
Accordingly, previous studies are either for stiff polymers in three dimensions

translocation of flexible polymers in three dimensions using Langevin dynamics.
We show that differences in binding mechanisms, more specifically, whether a
chaperone can bind to a single or multiple sites on the polymer, lead to
substantial differences in translocation dynamics in three dimensions. We show
that the single-binding mode leads to dynamics that is very much like that in
the constant-force driven translocation and accordingly mainly determined by
tension propagation on the cis side. We obtain $\beta \approx 1.26$ for the
exponent for the scaling of the translocation time with polymer length. This
fairly low value can be explained by the additional friction due to binding
particles. The multiple-site binding leads to translocation whose dynamics is
mainly determined by the trans side. For this process we obtain $\beta \approx
1.36$. This value can be explained by our derivation of $\beta = 4/3$ for
constant-bias translocation, where translocated polymer segments form a globule
on the trans side. Our results pave the way for understanding and utilizing
chaperone-assisted translocation where variations in microscopic details lead

a higher $H_0$ value in the presence of a bulk flow velocity dipole, finding
some evidence for this result which, however, cannot be claimed to be
significant due to the current large uncertainty in the SNe distance modulus.
Then, we conclude that the tension between different $H_0$ determinations can
plausibly be caused to the bulk flow motion of the local Universe, even though
the current incompleteness of the SNe data set, both in terms of celestial

have enabled pushing the scalability of the PIC method to extreme computational
scales. In this paper, we describe the methods developed to build a highly
parallelized PIC code across a broad range of supercomputer designs. This
particularly includes implementations on heterogeneous systems using NVIDIA GPU
accelerators and Intel Xeon Phi (MIC) co-processors and performance comparisons
with state-of-the-art homogeneous HPC systems such as Blue Gene/Q. New
discovery science capabilities in the magnetic fusion energy application domain
are enabled, including investigations of Ion-Temperature-Gradient (ITG) driven
turbulence simulations with unprecedented spatial resolution and long temporal
duration. Performance studies with realistic fusion experimental parameters are
carried out on multiple supercomputing systems spanning a wide range of cache
capacities, cache-sharing configurations, memory bandwidth, interconnects and
network topologies. These performance comparisons using a realistic
discovery-science-capable domain application code provide valuable insights on
optimization techniques across one of the broadest sets of current high-end
computing platforms worldwide.

fluxes emitted by a {\it spinning} particle in circular equatorial orbits about
a Kerr black hole. The particle dynamics is computed in the pole-dipole
approximation, solving the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations with the Tulczyjew
spin-supplementary-condition. The fluxes are computed, for the first time, by
solving the 2+1 Teukolsky equation in the time-domain using hyperboloidal and
horizon-penetrating coordinates. Denoting by $M$ the black hole mass and by
$\mu$ the particle mass, we cover dimensionless background spins
$a/M=(0,\pm0.9)$ and dimensionless particle spins $-0.9\leq S/\mu^2 \leq +0.9$.
Our results span orbits of Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radii $4\leq r/M \leq
30$; notably, we investigate the strong-field regime, in some cases even beyond
the last-stable-orbit. We confirm, numerically, the Tanaka {\it et al.} [Phys.\
Rev.\ D 54, 3762] 2.5th order accurate Post-Newtonian (PN) predictions for the
gravitational wave fluxes of a spinning particle in circular equatorial orbit:
we find an unambiguos trend of the PN-prediction towards the numerical results
when $r$ is large. At $r/M=30$ the fractional agreement between the full
numerical flux, approximated as the sum over the modes $m=1,2,3$, and the PN
prediction is $\lesssim0.5\%$ in all cases tested. This is close to our
fractional numerical accuracy ($\sim 0.2\%$). For smaller radii, the agreement
between the 2.5PN prediction and the numerical result progressively
deteriorates. Our numerical data will be essential to develop suitably resummed
expressions of the 2.5PN analytical fluxes in order to improve their accuracy
in the strong-field regime.

Erigone family confirm results obtained by other groups. The Erigone family,
however, is also characterized by its interaction with the $z_2$ secular
resonance. While less than 15% of its members are currently in librating states
of this resonance, the number of objects, members of the dynamical group, in
resonant states is high enough to allow to use the study of dynamics inside the
$z_2$ resonance to set constraints on the family age.
  Like the ${\nu}_{6}$ and $z_1$ secular resonances, the $z_2$ resonance is
characterized by one stable equilibrium point at $\sigma = 180^{\circ}$ in the
$z_2$ resonance plane $(\sigma, \frac{d\sigma}{dt})$, where $\sigma$ is the
resonant angle of the $z_2$ resonance. Diffusion in this plane occurs on
timescales of $\simeq 12$ My, which sets a lower limit on the Erigone family
age. Finally, the minimum time needed to reach a steady-state population of
$z_2$ librators is about 90 My, which allows to impose another, independent

substrate by releasing small quantity of a solvent. The solvent swells the
cylinder asymmetrically at one side and evaporates out of it from where it is
exposed to atmosphere. Because of inhomogeneous swelling, the cylinder bends
but tends to straighten out following evaporation of the solvent. Balance of
these two opposing effects induces the static state of the cylinder to
eventually bifurcate to a dynamic state of rolling. Similar to marangoni effect
in liquid, the rolling motion of cylinder is driven and sustained by the
curvature of the cylinder. The rolling velocity increases linearly with
curvature of the bent cylinder which ceases to locomote as the curvature
diminishes below a threshold limit. Similar to marangoni effect, the rolling
velocity increases also with temperature of the substrate and surroundings. A
scaling relation derived for the rolling velocity captures all these

atomic oscillations greatly exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons)
that determine the system temperature. Coherency and persistence of LAVs may
have drastic effect on quantum tunneling due to correlation effects discovered
by Schrodinger and Robertson in 1930. These effects have been applied to the
tunneling problem by a number of authors, who demonstrated a giant increase of
sub-barrier transparency during the increase of the correlation coefficient at
a special high-frequency periodic action on quantum system. Recently, it has
been proposed that discrete breathers (a sub-class of LAVs arising in periodic
systems) present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation
effects in regular crystals due to time-periodic modulation of the potential
well (or the Coulomb barrier) width and hence to act as breather nano-colliders
catalyzing low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids. It has been shown
that the tunneling probability for the D-D fusion under electrolysis of heavy
water increases enormously with increasing number of oscillations resulting in
the fusion rates comparable with those observed experimentally. In the present
paper, we discuss possible ways of engineering the nuclear-active environment

practical ways of catalyzing LENR that are based on a special electro-magnetic

the common definition is likely to generate large errors when dealing with

semiconductors using the traditional formula fails at giving the correct
electrostatic force between capacitor plates and reveals the existence of an
extra contribution to the standard electrostatic energy. This additional energy
is found to proceed from the generation of space charge regions which are
predicted when combining electrostatics laws with semiconductor statistics,
such as for accumulation and inversion layers. On the contrary, no such energy
exists when relying on electrostatics only, as for instance when adopting the
so-called full depletion approximation. The same holds for charged or neutral
insulators that are still consistent with the customary definition, but which
are in fact singular cases. In semiconductors, this additional free energy can
largely exceed the energy gained by the dipoles, thus becoming the dominant
term. Consequently, erroneous electrostatic forces in nanostructure systems
such as for MEMS and NEMS as well as incorrect energy calculations are expected
using the standard definition. This unexpected result clearly asks for a
generalization of electrostatic energy in matter in order to reconcile basic
concepts and to prevent flawed force evaluation in nanostructures with

  Polar Code Decoder","submitted to ISCAS2016",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an efficient hardware design approach for list successive
cancellation (LSC) decoding of polar codes. By applying path-overlapping
scheme, the l instances of (l > 1) successive cancellation (SC) decoder for LSC
with list size l can be cut down to only one. This results in a dramatic
reduction of the hardware complexity without any decoding performance loss. We
also develop novel approaches to reduce the latencyassociated with the pipeline
scheme. Simulation results show that with proposed design approach the hardware
efficiency is increased significantly over the recently proposed LSC decoders.

Dannert","The maximum force in a column under constant speed compression","11 pages, 4 figures","Acta Mechanica, 227(6), 1645-1652, 2016","10.1007/s00707-016-1586-5",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic buckling of an elastic column under compression at constant speed is
investigated assuming the first-mode buckling. Two cases are considered: (i) an
imperfect column (Hoff's statement), and (ii) a perfect column having an
initial lateral deflection. The range of parameters, where the maximum load
supported by a column exceeds Euler static force is determined. In this range,
the maximum load is represented as a function of the compression rate,
slenderness ratio, and imperfection/initial deflection. Considering the results
we answer the following question: ""How slowly the column should be compressed
in order to measure static load-bearing capacity?"" This question is important
for the proper setup of laboratory experiments and computer simulations of
buckling.
  Additionally, it is shown that the behavior of a perfect column having an
initial deflection differ significantlys form the behavior of an imperfect
column. In particular, the dependence of the maximum force on the compression
rate is non-monotonic. The analytical results are supported by numerical
simulations and available experimental data.

and B. The winning or losing of A and B game is defined by the change of one
unit of capital. Game A is a losing game if played continuously, with winning
probability $p=0.5-\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=0.003$. Game B is also losing and
it has two coins: a good coin with winning probability $p_g=0.75-\epsilon$ is
used if the player`s capital is not divisible by $3$, otherwise a bad coin with
winning probability $p_b=0.1-\epsilon$ is used. Parrondo paradox refers to the
situation that the mixture of A and B game in a sequence leads to winning in
the long run. The paradox can be resolved using Markov chain analysis. We
extend this setting of Parrondo game to involve players with one-step memory.
The player can win by switching his choice of A or B game in a Parrondo game
sequence. If the player knows the identity of the game he plays and the state
of his capital, then the player can win maximally. On the other hand, if the
player does not know the nature of the game, then he is playing a (C,D) game,
where either (C=A, D=B), or (C=B,D=A). For player with one-step memory playing
the AB3 game, he can achieve the highest expected gain with switching
probability equal to $3/4$ in the (C,D) game sequence. This result has been
found first numerically and then proven analytically. Generalization to AB
mod($M$) Parrondo game for other integer $M$ has been made for the general
domain of parameters $p_b<p=0.5=p_A <p_g$. (please read the PDF file for full

  minimal length scale","22 pages",,"10.13140/RG.2.1.2836.2961",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lie-type deformations provide a systematic way of generalising the symmetries
of modern physics. Deforming the isometry group of Minkowski spacetime through
the introduction of a minimal length scale $\ell$ leads to anti de Sitter
spacetime with isometry group $SO(2,3)$. Quantum spacetime on scales of the
order $\ell$ therefore carries negative curvature. Considering extended
particles of characteristic size $\ell$ carrying topological information and
requiring that their topological properties be compatible with those of the
underlying spacetime, we show that electroweak symmetries emerge from the
maximal compact subgroup of the anti de Sitter isometry group in a way that is
consistent with no-go theorems. It is speculated that additional deformation
outside the Lie-algebraic framework, such as $q$-deformations, could likewise
provide an explanation of the origin of the strong force.
