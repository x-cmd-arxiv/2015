the heating and substructure of coronal loops in the core of one such active

solar observations in two EUV channels (94 A and 335 A) from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We model the
evolution of a bundle of strands heated by a storm of nanoflares by means of a
hydrodynamic 0D loop model (EBTEL). The light curves obtained from the random
combination of those of single strands are compared to the observed light
curves either in a single pixel or in a row of pixels, simultaneously in the
two channels and using two independent methods: an artificial intelligent
system (Probabilistic Neural Network, PNN) and a simple cross-correlation
technique. We explore the space of the parameters to constrain the distribution
of the heat pulses, their duration and their spatial size, and, as a feedback
on the data, their signatures on the light curves. From both methods the best
agreement is obtained for a relatively large population of events (1000) with a
short duration (less than 1 min) and a relatively shallow distribution (power
law with index 1.5) in a limited energy range (1.5 decades). The feedback on
the data indicates that bumps in the light curves, especially in the 94 A
channel, are signatures of a heating excess that occurred a few minutes before.

sufficiently small perturbation of the right-hand-side vector, there exists a
dual solution that correctly ""prices"" the perturbation by computing the exact
change in the optimal objective function value. These properties may fail in
semi-infinite linear programming where the constraint vector space is infinite
dimensional. Unlike the finite-dimensional case, in semi-infinite linear
programs the constraint vector space is a modeling choice. We show that, for a
sufficiently restricted vector space, both (SD) and (DP) always hold, at the
cost of restricting the perturbations to that space. The main goal of the paper
is to extend this restricted space to the largest possible constraint space
where (SD) and (DP) hold. Once (SD) or (DP) fail for a given constraint space,
then these conditions fail for all larger constraint spaces. We give sufficient
conditions for when (SD) and (DP) hold in an extended constraint space. Our
results require the use of linear functionals that are singular or purely
finitely additive and thus not representable as finite support vectors. The key
to understanding these linear functionals is the extension of the

scattering, but the error of the theoretical cross section due to uncertainties
of $G_A$ remains to be established. Reversely, the extraction of $G_A$ from the
neutrino nucleus cross section suffers from large systematic errors due to
nuclear model dependencies, while the use of single parameter dipole fits
underestimates the errors and prevents an identification of the relevant
kinematics for this determination. We propose to use a generalized
axial-vector-meson-dominance (AVMD) in conjunction with large-$N_c$ and high
energy QCD constrains to model the nucleon axial form factor, as well as the
half width rule as an a priori uncertainty estimate. The minimal hadronic
ansatz comprises the sum of two monopoles corresponding to the lightest
axial-vector mesons being coupled to the axial current. The parameters of the
resulting axial form factor are the masses and widths of the two axial mesons
as obtained from the averaged PDG values. By applying the half width rule in a
Monte Carlo simulation, a distribution of theoretical predictions can then be
generated for the neutrino-nucleus quasielastic cross section. We test the
model by applying it to the $(\nu_\mu,\mu)$ quasielastic cross section from
$^{12}$C for the kinematics of the MiniBooNE experiment. The resulting
predictions have no free parameters. We find that the relativistic Fermi gas
model globally reproduces the experimental data, giving $\chi^2/ \# bins =
0.81$. A $Q^2$-dependent error analysis of the neutrino data shows that the
uncertainties in the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ are comparable to the ones
induced by the a priori half width rule. We identify the most sensitive region
to be in the range $0.2 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 0.6 \,{\rm GeV}^2$.

perpendicular to the jet. The HS emission is formed by a point source
surrounded by an extended emission. The viewing angle of the jet is about 30

explained based on a simple model comprising the isotropic superexchange and
the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This model explains the
magnetization behavior in the entire range of doping and temperature including
the magnetization reversal which results from an interplay of various DM
interactions such as, Fe-O-Fe, Cr-O-Cr and Fe-O-Cr.

of functionality but also with respect to security and privacy for subscribers.
  We carefully analyzed LTE access network protocol specifications and
uncovered several vulnerabilities. Using commercial LTE mobile devices in real
LTE networks, we demonstrate inexpensive, and practical attacks exploiting
these vulnerabilities. Our first class of attacks consists of three different
ways of making an LTE device leak its location: A semi-passive attacker can
locate an LTE device within a 2 sq.km area within a city whereas an active
attacker can precisely locate an LTE device using GPS co-ordinates or
trilateration via cell-tower signal strength information. Our second class of
attacks can persistently deny some or all services to a target LTE device. To
the best of our knowledge, our work constitutes the first publicly reported
practical attacks against LTE access network protocols.
  We present several countermeasures to resist our specific attacks. We also
discuss possible trade-offs that may explain why these vulnerabilities exist
and recommend that safety margins introduced into future specifications to
address such trade-offs should incorporate greater agility to accommodate
subsequent changes in the trade-off equilibrium.

the controlflow graphs of most programs. We allow for multiple possible
queries, which arise naturally in demand driven dataflow analysis. The study of
multiple queries allows us to consider the tradeoff between the resource usage
of the one-time preprocessing and for each individual query. The traditional
approach constructs the product graph of all components and applies the
best-known graph algorithm on the product. In this approach, even the answer to
a single query requires the transitive closure, which provides no room for
tradeoff between preprocessing and query time.
  Our main contributions are algorithms that significantly improve the
worst-case running time of the traditional approach, and provide various
tradeoffs depending on the number of queries. For example, in a concurrent
system of two components, the traditional approach requires hexic time in the
worst case for answering one query as well as computing the transitive closure,
whereas we show that with one-time preprocessing in almost cubic time, each
subsequent query can be answered in at most linear time, and even the
transitive closure can be computed in almost quartic time. Furthermore, we
establish conditional optimality results showing that the worst-case running
time of our algorithms cannot be improved without achieving major breakthroughs

be demonstrated, NO$\nu$A will be capable of a competitive indirect dark matter
search for low-mass WIMPs. The cosmic ray muon rate at the NO$\nu$A far

resummed, showing the exponential sensitivity of the curvature spectrum to
potential features. More generally, this exponential approximation provides a
power spectrum template which nonlinearly obeys relations between excitation
coefficients and whose parameters may be appropriately adjusted. For a large
sharp step in the potential, it greatly improves the analytic power spectrum
template and its dependence on potential parameters. For axionic oscillations
in the potential, it corrects the mapping between the potential and the
amplitude, phase and zero point of the curvature oscillations, which might
otherwise cause erroneous inferences in for example the tensor-scalar ratio,
formally even when that amplitude is $10^3$ times larger than the slow roll

limit of an infinite chain incommensurate with the substrate, Aubry predicted a
structural transition with increasing substrate potential, from the chain's
intrinsic arrangement free to slide on the substrate, to a pinned arrangement
favoring the substrate pattern. To date, the Aubry transition has not been
observed. Here, using a chain of cold ions subject to a periodic optical
potential we qualitatively and quantitatively establish a close relation
between Aubry's sliding-to-pinned transition and superlubricity breaking in
stick-slip friction. Using friction measurements with high spatial resolution
and individual ion detection, we experimentally observe the Aubry transition
and the onset of its hallmark fractal atomic arrangement. Notably, the observed
critical lattice depth for a finite chain agrees well with the Aubry prediction
for an infinite chain. Our results elucidate the connection between competing

amplitude, or fails to propagate. This has limited their ability to explain
graded neuronal responses. Recently, we have shown that pulse-gated synfire
chains are capable of propagating graded information coded in mean population
current or firing rate amplitudes. In particular, we showed that it is possible
to use one synfire chain to provide gating pulses and a second, pulse-gated
synfire chain to propagate graded information. We called these circuits
synfire-gated synfire chains (SGSCs). Here, we present SGSCs in which graded
information can rapidly cascade through a neural circuit, and show a
correspondence between this type of transfer and a mean-field model in which
gating pulses overlap in time. We show that SGSCs are robust in the presence of
variability in population size, pulse timing and synaptic strength. Finally, we
demonstrate the computational capabilities of SGSC-based information coding by
implementing a self-contained, spike-based, modular neural circuit that is
triggered by, then reads in streaming input, processes the input, then makes a
decision based on the processed information and shuts itself down.

applied to describe on the one hand passive colloidal suspensions, including

DDFT. Here we go one essential step further and combine these two approaches.
We establish a DDFT for active microswimmer suspensions. For this purpose,
simple minimal model microswimmers are introduced. These microswimmers
self-propel by setting the surrounding fluid into motion. They hydrodynamically
interact with each other through their actively self-induced fluid flows and
via the common ""passive"" hydrodynamic interactions. An effective soft steric
repulsion is also taken into account. We derive the DDFT starting from common
statistical approaches. Our DDFT is then tested and applied by characterizing a
suspension of microswimmers the motion of which is restricted to a plane within
a three-dimensional bulk fluid. Moreover, the swimmers are confined by a
radially symmetric trapping potential. In certain parameter ranges, we find
rotational symmetry breaking in combination with the formation of a
""hydrodynamic pumping state"", which has previously been observed in the
literature as a result of particle-based simulations. An additional instability
of this pumping state is revealed.

likelihoods. We show that, owing to strong correlations with the reionization
optical depth $\tau$ and the primordial perturbation amplitude $A_s$, a

the low ($\ell\leq 30$) and high ($30<\ell\lesssim 2500$) multipoles
likelihoods. With Hillipop, another high-$\ell$ likelihood built from Planck
data, this difference is lowered to $1.3\sigma$. In this case, the $A_L$ value
is still in disagreement with unity by $2.2\sigma$, suggesting a non-trivial
effect of the correlations between cosmological and nuisance parameters. To
better constrain the nuisance foregrounds parameters, we include the very high
$\ell$ measurements of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole

Hillipop+ACT+SPT likelihood estimate of the optical depth is
$\tau=0.052\pm{0.035,}$ which is now fully compatible with the low $\ell$

have a significant impact on deep learning and other machine-learning
applications. Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential
candidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these
state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main
limitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like
distribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\it
instance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical
temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be
possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this
work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple
effective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study
assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special
class of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can
serve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a
comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100.
Although assuming a suitable fixed effective temperature also allows us to
outperform one step contrastive divergence (CD-1), only when using an
instance-dependent effective temperature do we find a performance close to that
of CD-100 for the case studied here.

ascribed this feature to impurity phases, sample vacancies, and surface
reconstructions. Given the typical methods used to prepare SmB6 single
crystals, the flux and floating zone procedures, these ascriptions should not
be taken lightly. Here, we demonstrate how compositional variations and
observable amounts of impurity phases in SmB6 crystals grown by floating zone
and flux affect the physical properties. From neutron diffraction and X-ray
computed tomography experiments, we observe that a 154Sm11B6 crystal prepared
using aluminum flux contains co-crystallized, epitaxial aluminum. A large,
nearly stoichiometric crystal of SmB6 was successfully grown using the
float-zone technique; upon continuing the zone melting, samarium vacancies are
introduced. These samarium vacancies drastically alter the resistance and
plateauing magnitude of the low temperature resistance compared to
stoichiometric SmB6. These results highlight that small presences of impurity
phases and compositional variations must be considered when collecting and
analyzing physical property data of SmB6. Finally, a more accurate samarium-154
coherent neutron scattering length value, 8.9(1) fm, is reported.

virial estimators by combining our dataset with previous high redshift
measurements. This updated comparison spans a total of 3 decades in BH mass. We
calculate a virial factor for CIV/CIII] logf(CIV/CIII])=0.87 with an estimated

evolution of galaxies amid frequent gravitational encounters. These nearby
groups have conditions similar to those in the earlier universe when galaxies
were assembled and give us the opportunity to witness hierarchical formation in
progress. To understand how the compact group environment affects galaxy
evolution, we examine the gas and dust in these groups. We present new
single-dish GBT neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of 30 compact groups and
define a new way to quantify the group HI content as the HI-to-stellar mass
ratio of the group as a whole. We compare the HI content with mid-IR indicators
of star formation and optical [g-r] color to search for correlations between
group gas content and star formation activity of individual group members.
Quiescent galaxies tend to live in HI-poor groups, and galaxies with active
star formation are more commonly found in HI-rich groups. Intriguingly, we also
find ""rogue"" galaxies whose star formation does not correlate with group HI
content. In particular, we identify three galaxies (NGC 2968 in RSCG 34, KUG
1131+202A in RSCG 42, and NGC 4613 in RSCG 64) whose mid-IR activity is
discrepant with the HI. We speculate that this mismatch between mid-IR activity
and HI content is a consequence of strong interactions in this environment that
can strip HI from galaxies and abruptly affect star-formation. Ultimately,
characterizing how and on what timescales the gas is processed in compact
groups will help us understand the interstellar medium in complex, dense
environments similar to the earlier Universe.

estimated diameter $\sim$2.6 km (for assumed visual geometric albedo $p_V$ =
0.04). Variations in the brightness of the nucleus at the 10% to 15% level are
significant in both 2011 December and 2012 October but we possess too few data
to distinguish variations caused by activity from those caused by rotation. The
dust scattering cross-section in 2011 December is $\sim$40 km$^2$,
corresponding to a dust mass $\sim$9$\times$10$^6$ kg (88 $\mu$m mean particle
radius assumed). The full width at half maximum of the debris sheet varies from
$\sim$100 km near the nucleus to $\sim$1000 km 30arcsec (40,000 km) east of it.
Dust dynamical models indicate ejection speeds between 0.06 and 0.3 m s$^{-1}$,
particle sizes between 10 and 300 $\mu$m and an inverse square-root relation
between particle size and velocity. Overall, the data are most simply explained
by prolonged, low velocity ejection of dust, starting in or before 2011 July
and continuing until at least 2011 October. These properties are consistent
with the sublimation of near-surface ice aided by centrifugal forces. The high
spatial resolution of our HST images (52 km per pixel) reveals details that
remained hidden in previous ground-based observations, such as the
extraordinarily small vertical extent of the dust sheet, ejection speeds well
below the nucleus escape speed, and the possibility of a binary nucleus.

estimate uses the methodology developed previously by An et al. to study in
situ halo stars, but is based on a factor of two larger sample than available
before, with much-improved photometric errors and zero-points. The newly
obtained MDF can be divided into multiple populations of halo stars, with peak
metallicities at [Fe/H] $\approx -1.4$ and $-1.9$, which we associate with the
inner-halo and outer-halo populations of the Milky Way, respectively. We find
that the kinematics of these stars (based on proper-motion measurements at high
Galactic latitude) supports the proposed dichotomy of the halo, as stars with
retrograde motions in the rest frame of the Galaxy are generally more
metal-poor than stars with prograde motions, consistent with previous claims.
In addition, we generate mock catalogs of stars from a simulated Milk Way halo
system, and demonstrate for the first time that the chemically- and
kinematically-distinct properties of the inner- and outer-halo populations are
qualitatively in agreement with our observations. The decomposition of the
observed MDF and our comparison with the mock catalog results suggest that the
outer-halo population contributes on the order of $\sim35\%$-$55\%$ of halo
stars in the local volume.

all four stars have undetectable amounts of neutron-capture elements Sr and Ba,
with upper limits comparable to the lowest ever detected in the halo or in

over time, suggesting it to be in a binary system. Its variable velocity has
likely increased past determinations of the Boo II velocity dispersion. Our
four stars span a limited metallicity range, but their enhanced

interpretation that Boo II has been enriched by very few generations of stars.
The chemical abundance pattern in Boo II confirms the emerging trend that the

probably the simplest case of doping a Mott insulator. The motion of such a
single hole will generally induce a many-body phase shift, which can be
identified by an exact sign structure of the model known as the phase string.
We show that the sign structure is nontrivial even in this simplest problem,
which is responsible for the essential properties of Mott physics. We find that
the characteristic momentum structure, the Luttinger liquid behavior, and the
quantum phase interference of the hole under a periodic boundary condition, can
all be attributed to it. We use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
numerical simulation to make a comparative study of the $t$-$J$ chain and a
model in which the sign structure is switched off. We further show that the key
DMRG results can be reproduced by a variational wave function with
incorporating the correct sign structure. Physical implications of the sign
structure for doped Mott insulators in general are also discussed.

book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP
components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests

0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants.
It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels

(GMCT) of the glass transition, which seeks to describe the dynamics of
glass-forming liquids using only static structural information as input. This
theory amounts to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for multi-point
density correlations, the lowest-order closure of which is equivalent to
standard mode-coupling theory. Here we focus on simplified schematic GMCT
hierarchies, which lack any explicit wavevector-dependence and therefore allow
for greater analytical and numerical tractability. For one particular schematic
model, we derive the unique analytic solution of the infinite hierarchy, and
demonstrate that closing the hierarchy at finite order leads to uniform
convergence as the closure level increases. We also show numerically that a
similarly robust convergence pattern emerges for more generic schematic GMCT
models, suggesting that the GMCT framework is generally convergent, even though
no small parameter exists in the theory. Finally, we discuss how different
effective weights on the high-order contributions ultimately control whether
the transition is continuous, discontinuous, or strictly avoided, providing new
means to relate structure to dynamics in glass-forming systems.

a relativistic accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH)

scales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs of
gas for the continuing AGN activity. And on all scales from the black hole
outwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of the
host galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the AGN itself. In this review

the X-ray continuum by NuSTAR are pushing us to conclude that X-ray coronae are
radiatively-compact and have electron temperatures regulated by
electron-positron pair production. We show that the predominance of
rapidly-rotating objects in current surveys of SMBH spin is entirely
unsurprising once one accounts for the observational selection bias resulting
from the spin-dependence of the radiative efficiency. We review recent progress

of shocks and relativistic particle acceleration in these transient systems.
Although there is evidence for a spectral cut-off above energies ~1-100 GeV at
particular epochs in some novae, the maximum particle energy achieved in these
accelerators has remained an open question. The high densities of the nova
ejecta (~10 orders of magnitude larger than in supernova remnants) render the
gas far upstream of the shock neutral and shielded from ionizing radiation. The
amplification of the magnetic field needed for diffusive shock acceleration
requires ionized gas, thus confining the acceleration process to a narrow
photo-ionized layer immediately ahead of the shock. Based on the growth rate in
this layer of the hybrid non-resonant cosmic ray current-driven instability
(considering also ion-neutral damping), we quantify the maximum particle
energy, Emax, across the range of shock velocities and upstream densities of
interest. We find values of Emax ~ 10 GeV - 10 TeV, which are broadly
consistent with the inferred spectral cut-offs, but which could also in
principle lead to emission extending to higher energies >100 GeV accessible to
atmosphere Cherenkov telescopes, such as the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA). Detecting TeV neutrinos with IceCube in hadronic scenarios appears to be
more challenging, although the prospects are improved if the shock power during
the earliest, densest phases of the nova outburst is higher than is implied by
the observed GeV light curves, due to downscattering of the gamma-rays by
electrons within the ejecta. Novae provide ideal nearby laboratories to study
magnetic field amplification and the onset of cosmic ray acceleration, because
other time-dependent sources (e.g. radio supernovae) typically occur too
distant to detect as gamma-ray sources.

The enhanced gauge symmetry at the self-dual point and the Higgs-like mechanism

a small binary separation of only $\simeq{200}$ inner disk radii. This

mechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of
WD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is
highly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production
before the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly
employed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are
expected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more
susceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of
WD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation
ignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically
reducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the
fate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics
calculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of
the CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region
successfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He
shell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.
Although we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in
previous studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed
investigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.
This allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning
physics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary
calculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD
collisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components.

ultimately flow to the velocity of light, independently of the initial
conditions, the number of fermionic and bosonic flavors, and the value of the
couplings at the critical point. In three dimensions, due to the analyticity of
the gauge field propagator, both the $U(1)$ charge and the velocity of light
flow, which leads to a richer behavior than in two dimensions. We show that all
three velocities ultimately flow to a common terminal velocity, which is
non-universal and different from the original velocity of light. Therefore,

recoil from $\beta$-delayed nucleon emission can be used to measure the
energies of the nucleons. This method has never been tested using
$\beta$-delayed proton emission or applied to a recoil heavier than $A=10$.
  Purpose: To test and apply this Doppler broadening method using $\gamma$-ray
peaks from the $^{26}$P($\beta p\gamma$)$^{25}$Al decay sequence.
  Methods: A fast beam of $^{26}$P was implanted into a planar Ge detector,
which was used as a $^{26}$P $\beta$-decay trigger. The SeGA array of
high-purity Ge detectors was used to detect $\gamma$ rays from the
$^{26}$P($\beta p\gamma$)$^{25}$Al decay sequence.
  Results: Radiative Doppler broadening in $\beta$-delayed proton-$\gamma$
decay was observed for the first time. The Doppler broadening analysis method
was verified using the 1613 keV $\gamma$-ray line for which the proton energies
were previously known. The 1776 keV $\gamma$ ray de-exciting the 2720 keV
$^{25}$Al level was observed in $^{26}$P($\beta p\gamma$)$^{25}$Al decay for
the first time and used to determine that the center-of-mass energy of the
proton emission feeding the 2720-keV level is 5.1 $\pm$ 1.0 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.6
(syst.) MeV, corresponding to a $^{26}$Si excitation energy of 13.3 $\pm$ 1.0
(stat.) $\pm$ 0.6 (syst.) MeV for the proton-emitting level.
  Conclusions: The Doppler broadening method has been demonstrated to provide
practical measurements of the energies for $\beta$-delayed nucleon emissions
populating excited states of nuclear recoils at least as heavy as $A=25$.

The source of such a map is space-time, which can be curved due to gravity. The
map itself needs to be curved in its gauge field part so as to describe
interaction forces like those mediated by photons and gluons. In the present
article, we permit non-zero curvature also on the internal space, the target of
the field map.
  The action functional and the symmetries are constructed in such a way that
they reduce to those of standard Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) gauge theories
precisely when the curvature on the target of the fields is turned off. For
curved targets one obtains a new theory, a curved YMH gauge theory. It realizes
in a mathematically consistent manner an old wish in the community: replacing
structures constants by functions depending on the scalars of the theory. In
addition, we provide a simple 4d toy model, where the gauge symmetry is
abelian, but turning off the gauge fields, no rigid symmetry remains---another
possible manifestation of target curvature.
  It now remains to be seen, if internal curvature in the above sense is
realized in nature. Curvature of space-time is proven, but still negligible in
particle physics, except for the very early universe where quantum gravity must
have played an essential role. An important question therefore is, if glimpses
of target curvature can be visible in accelerator physics. We know that at
contemporary energy scales, the usual (flat) standard model describes nature to
a very high accuracy. Could it be that the alleged deviations in the B to
D-star-tau-nu decay reported by BaBar in 2012 and recently also by LHCb are
already a manifestation of target curvature? What kind of effects does target
curvature have on a YMH theory in general, for what kind of effects do we need
to look out for so as to detect it?

peak, the 0.5-5keV count rate had increased from that in the low flux state by
a factor of 10. A target of opportunity observation was triggered with NuSTAR,
catching the decline of the flare on 2014 September 20. We present a joint
analysis of Swift and NuSTAR observations to understand the cause of this
flare. The X-ray spectrum shows an increase in directly observed continuum flux
and the softening of the continuum spectrum to a photon index of 2.49
(-0.07,+0.08) compared to the previous low flux observations. The X-ray
spectrum remains well-described by the relativistically blurred reflection of
the continuum from the accretion disc whose emissivity profile suggests that it
is illuminated by a compact X-ray source, extending at most 5.2rg over the
disc. A very low reflection fraction of 0.41 (-0.15,+0.15) is measured,
unexpected for such a compact corona. The X-ray flare is, hence, interpreted as
arising from the vertical collimation and ejection of the X-ray emitting corona
at a mildly relativistic velocity, causing the continuum emission to be beamed
away from the disc. As the flare subsides, the base of this jet-like structure
collapses into a compact X-ray source that provides the majority of the
radiation that illuminates the disc while continuum emission is still detected
from energetic particles further out, maintaining the low reflection fraction.

stripped, leading to a rapid quenching of their star formation activity. This
dramatic environmental effect is generally not taken into account in the SFHs
usually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of these
galaxies, yielding to a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, a
biased estimate of the SFR. We aim at reproducing the SFH of galaxies that
underwent a rapid star formation quenching using a truncated delayed SFH that
we implemented in the SED fitting code CIGALE. We show that the ratio between
the instantaneous SFR and the SFR just before the quenching ($r_{SFR}$) is well
constrained as long as rest frame UV data are available. This SED modelling is
applied to the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) containing isolated galaxies and
sources falling in the dense environment of the Virgo cluster. The latter are
HI-deficient due to ram pressure stripping. We show that the truncated delayed
SFH successfully reproduces their SED while typical SFH assumptions fail. A
good correlation is found between $r_{SFR}$ and HI-def, the parameter
quantifying the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that SED fitting
results can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency of
galaxies for which HI observations are not available. The HRS galaxies are
placed on the SFR-$M_*$ diagram showing that the HI-deficient sources lie in
the quiescent region confirming previous studies. Using the $r_{SFR}$
parameter, we derive the SFR of these sources before quenching and show that
they were previously on the main sequence relation. We show that the $r_{SFR}$
parameter is also well recovered for deeply obscured high redshift sources, as
well as in absence of IR data. SED fitting is thus a powerful tool to identify
galaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching.

addressed, while other constraints from quark- and lepton-flavor physics are
met. In fact, the minimal structure of the setup allows for the implementation
of a very powerful flavor protection, which avoids the appearance of new
sources of flavor-changing neutral currents to very good approximation.
Finally, the new lepton sector provides a parametrically enhanced correction to
the Higgs mass, such that the need for ultra-light top partners is weakened
considerably, linking the mass of the latter with the size of the neutrino

azimuthally-averaged radial HI column-density profiles. All galaxies have an HI
disk that extends beyond the readily observable stellar disk, with an average
ratio and scatter of R_{HI}/R_{25}=1.35+/-0.22, and a majority of the galaxies
appear to have a warped HI disk. A tight correlation exists between total HI
mass and HI diameter, with the largest disks having a slightly lower average
column density. Galaxies with relatively large HI disks tend to exhibit an
enhanced stellar velocity dispersion at larger radii, suggesting the influence
of the gas disk on the stellar dynamics in the outer regions of disk galaxies.
We find a striking similarity among the radial HI surface density profiles,
where the average, normalized radial profile of the late-type spirals is
described surprisingly well with a Gaussian profile. These results can be used

range of studies. The entanglement spectrum is the spectrum of the reduced
density matrix, when we partition the system into two. For many quantum
systems, it unveils a unique feature: Computed from the bulk ground state wave
function, the entanglement spectrum give access to the physics of edge
excitations. Using this property, the entanglement spectroscopy has proved to
be a highly valuable tool to diagnose topological ordering. These lectures
intend to provide an overview of the entanglement spectroscopy, mainly in the
context of the fractional quantum Hall effect. We introduce the basic concepts
through the case of the quantum spin chains. We discuss the connection with the
entanglement entropy and the matrix product state representation. We show how
the entanglement spectrum can be computed for non-interacting topological
phases and how it reveals the edge excitation from the ground state. We then
present an extensive review of the entanglement spectra applied to the
fractional quantum Hall phases, showing how much information is encoded within
the ground state and how different partitions probe different type of
excitations. Finally, we discuss the application of this tool to study the
fractional Chern insulators.

amorphous ice crystallization can occur at depths corresponding to those of the
observed pits in a timescale shorter than 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's lifetime
in the comet's activity zone in the inner solar system. Sublimation of
crystalline ice down to such depths is possible only in the absence of a dust
mantle, which requires the presence of dust grains in the matrix small enough
to be dragged out by gas from the pores. Our results are consistent with both
pits formation via sinkholes or subsequent to outbursts, the dominant process
depending on the status of the subsurface porosity. A sealed dust mantle would
favor episodic and disruptive outgassing as a result of an increasing gas
pressure in the pores, while a high porosity should allow the formation of
large voids in the subsurface due to the continuous escape of volatiles. We
finally conclude that the subsurface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is not
uniform at a spatial scale of 100-200~m.

show how the observations can constrain the accretion models (e.g. clumpy

a galaxy-scale outflow. In many circumstances this hot gas radiates
inefficiently and is therefore difficult to observe directly. We present an
indirect method to detect the presence of a hot bubble using hydrostatic
photoionization calculations of the cold (~10^4 K) line-emitting gas. We
compare our calculations with observations of the broad line region, the inner
face of the torus, the narrow line region (NLR), and the extended NLR, and thus
constrain the hot gas pressure at distances 0.1 pc -- 10 kpc from the center.
We find that emission line ratios observed in the average quasar spectrum are
consistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models on all scales. On scales
<40 pc a dynamically significant hot gas pressure is ruled out, while on larger
scales the hot gas pressure cannot exceed six times the local radiation
pressure. In individual quasars, ~25% of quasars exhibit NLR ratios that are
inconsistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models, though in these objects
the hot gas pressure is also unlikely to exceed the radiation pressure by an
order of magnitude or more. The derived upper limits on the hot gas pressure
imply that the instantaneous gas pressure force acting on galaxy-scale outflows
falls short of the time-averaged force needed to explain the large momentum
fluxes \dot{p} >> L_AGN/c inferred for galaxy-scale outflows. This apparent
discrepancy can be reconciled if optical quasars previously experienced a
buried, fully-obscured phase during which the hot gas bubble was more
effectively confined and during which galactic wind acceleration occurred.

disc instability (VDI) in clumpy galaxies at high redshift, $z=1$--$5$. Our
simulated galaxies are not in the ideal state assumed in Toomre instability, of
linear fluctuations in an isolated, uniform, rotating disk. There, instability
is characterised by a $Q$ parameter below unity, and lower when the disk is
thick. Instead, the high-redshift discs are highly perturbed. Over long periods
they consist of non-linear perturbations, compact massive clumps and extended
structures, with new clumps forming in inter-clump regions. This is while the
galaxy is subject to frequent external perturbances. We compute the local,
two-component $Q$ parameter for gas and stars, smoothed on a $\sim1~{\rm kpc}$
scale to capture clumps of $10^{8-9}~{\rm M}_\odot$. The $Q<1$ regions are
confined to collapsed clumps due to the high surface density there, while the
inter-clump regions show $Q$ significantly higher than unity. Tracing the
clumps back to their relatively smooth Lagrangian patches, we find that $Q$
prior to clump formation typically ranges from unity to a few. This is unlike
the expectations from standard Toomre instability. We discuss possible
mechanisms for high-$Q$ clump formation, e.g. rapid turbulence decay leading to
small clumps that grow by mergers, non-axisymmetric instability, or clump
formation induced by non-linear perturbations in the disk. Alternatively, the
high-$Q$ non-linear VDI may be stimulated by the external perturbations such as
mergers and counter-rotating streams. The high $Q$ may represent excessive
compressive modes of turbulence, possibly induced by tidal interactions.

show that the GNM Kirchhoff matrix can be built from the ideal low-pass filter,
which is a special case of a wide class of correlation functions underpinning
the linear scaling flexibility-rigidity index(FRI) method. Based on the
mathematical structure of correlation functions, we propose a unified framework
to construct generalized Kirchhoff matrices whose matrix inverse leads to
gGNMs, whereas, the direct inverse of its diagonal elements gives rise to FRI
method.With this connection,we further introduce two multiscale elastic network
models, namely, multiscale GNM(mGNM) and multiscale ANM(mANM), which are able
to incorporate different scales into the generalized Kirchkoff matrices or
generalized Hessian matrices.We validate our new multiscale methods with
extensive numerical experiments. We illustrate that gGNMs outperform the
original GNM method in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins.We
demonstrate that for a given correlation function, FRI and gGNM methods provide
essentially identical B-factor predictions when the scale value in the
correlation function is sufficiently large.More importantly,we reveal intrinsic
multiscale behavior in protein structures. The proposed mGNM and mANM are able
to capture this multiscale behavior and thus give rise to a significant
improvement of more than 11% in B-factor predictions over the original GNM and
ANM methods. We further demonstrate benefit of our mGNM in the B-factor
predictions on many proteins that fail the original GNM method. We show that
the present mGNM can also be used to analyze protein domain separations.
Finally, we showcase the ability of our mANM for the simulation of protein
collective motions.

on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample at z ~ 0.1. This
implies a significant revision of the high mass end of the correlation between
stellar and halo mass. Inferences about the evolution of the luminosity and
stellar mass functions depend strongly on the assumed, and uncertain, k+e
corrections. In turn, these depend on the assumed age of the population.
Applying k+e corrections taken from fitting the models of Maraston et al.
(2009) to the colors of both SDSS and CMASS galaxies, the evolution of the
luminosity and stellar mass functions appears impressively passive, provided
that the fits are required to return old ages. However, when matched in
comoving number- or luminosity-density, the SDSS galaxies are less strongly
clustered compared to their counterparts in CMASS. This rules out the passive
evolution scenario, and, indeed, any minor merger scenarios which preserve the
rank ordering in stellar mass of the population. Potential incompletenesses in
the CMASS sample would further enhance this mismatch. Our analysis highlights
the virtue of combining clustering measurements with number counts.

apply FD technique at the PBS such that the PBS can send the desired signals

consider the narrowband single-user case, where the MBS serves a single macro
UE and each PBS serves a single PUE. We obtain the closed-form solution of the
optimal fICIC scheme, and analyze its asymptotical performance in ICI-dominated
scenario. We then investigate the general narrowband multi-user case, where
both MBS and PBSs serve multiple UEs. We devise a low-complexity algorithm to
optimize the fICIC aimed at maximizing the downlink sum rate of the PUEs
subject to user fairness constraint. Finally, the generalization of the fICIC
to wideband systems is investigated. Simulations validate the analytical
results and demonstrate the advantages of the fICIC on mitigating cross-tier

that can be treated as a neutralizing, screening background. In appropriately
scaled units, interactions are characterized entirely by a screening parameter,
$\kappa$. As a result, systems of similar $\kappa$ show the same dynamics,
regardless of the underlying parameters (e.g., density and temperature). We
demonstrate this behavior using ultracold neutral plasmas (UNP) created by
photoionizing a cold ($T\le10$ mK) gas. The ions in UNP systems are well
described by the Yukawa model, with the electrons providing the screening.
Creation of the plasma through photoionization can be thought of as a rapid
quench from $\kappa_{0}=\infty$ to a final $\kappa$ value set by the electron
density and temperature. We demonstrate experimentally that the post-quench
dynamics are universal in $\kappa$ over a factor of 30 in density and an order
of magnitude in temperature. Results are compared with molecular dynamics
simulations. We also demonstrate that features of the post-quench kinetic
energy evolution, such as disorder-induced heating and kinetic-energy
oscillations, can be used to determine the plasma density and the electron
temperature.

energy penalties and decoding to suppress and correct errors that degrade the
performance of quantum annealers in solving optimization problems. While QAC
has been experimentally demonstrated to successfully error-correct a range of
optimization problems, a clear understanding of its operating mechanism has
been lacking. Here we bridge this gap using tools from quantum statistical
mechanics. We study analytically tractable models using a mean-field analysis,
specifically the $p$-body ferromagnetic infinite-range transverse-field Ising
model as well as the quantum Hopfield model. We demonstrate that for $p=2$,
where the phase transition is of second order, QAC pushes the transition to
increasingly larger transverse field strengths. For $p\ge3$, where the phase
transition is of first order, QAC softens the closing of the gap for small
energy penalty values and prevents its closure for sufficiently large energy
penalty values. Thus QAC provides protection from excitations that occur near
the quantum critical point. We find similar results for the Hopfield model,
thus demonstrating that our conclusions hold in the presence of disorder.

is interested in recovering an unknown signal from the magnitude (intensity) of

retrieval, recent developments in compressed sensing and convex
optimization-based signal recovery have inspired a host of new ones. This work
presents an overview of these approaches.
  Since phase retrieval, by its very nature, is ill-posed, to make the problem
meaningful one needs to either assume prior structure on the signal (e.g.,
sparsity) or obtain additional measurements (e.g., masks, structured
illuminations). For both the cases, we review conditions for the
identifiability of the signal, as well as practical algorithms for signal
recovery. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to robustly and

importance in armed conflict such as the ongoing violence in Syria, as well as

For example, statistical estimates of death counts were cited as important
evidence in the trial of General Efra\'in R\'ios Montt for acts of genocide in
Guatemala. Estimation relies on both record linkage and multiple systems
estimation. A key first step in this process is identifying ways to partition
the records such that they are computationally manageable. This step is
referred to as blocking and is a major challenge for the Syrian database since
it is sparse in the number of duplicate records and feature poor in its
attributes. As a consequence, we propose locality sensitive hashing (LSH)
methods to overcome these challenges. We demonstrate the computational
superiority and error rates of these methods by comparing our proposed approach
with others in the literature. We conclude with a discussion of many challenges
of merging LSH with record linkage to achieve an estimate of the number of
uniquely documented deaths in the Syrian conflict.

part of Saturn's E ring. Both moons are embedded in an arc of dust particles.
To understand the amount of micron-sized dust and their spatial distribution in
these arcs, we model the source, dynamical evolution, and sinks of these dust
in the arc. We assume hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids on the moons as
source of these dust (Hedman et al., 2009), the so called impact-ejecta process
(Krivov et al., 2003; Spahn et al., 2006). After ejecting and escaping from the
moons, these micron-sized particles are subject to several perturbing forces,
including gravitational perturbation from Mimas, oblateness of Saturn, Lorentz
force, solar radiation pressure, and plasma drag. Particles can be either
confined in the arcs due to corotational resonance with Mimas, as their source
moons (Spitale et al., 2006; Cooper et al., 2008; Hedman et al., 2009), or
pushed outward by plasma drag. Particle sinks are recollisions with the source
moon, collision with other moons, or migrate out of the radial zone of
interest. In addition to that, the upper limit of the particle lifetimes are
controlled by plasma sputtering, which decreases the particle size in a rate of
order 1$\mu$m radius every 100 years (Johnson et al., 2008). Our simulation
results show that ejecta from both moons can form the arcs of maximal optical
depths $\tau$ in the order of $10^{-8} - 10^{-6}$, although the absolute amount
of dust have uncertainties. We also find out the longitudinal extension of the
arcs in our simulation are consistent with observation and the theory. Smaller
particles are more likely to escape the arc because of the stronger influence
of plasma drag. On the other hand, large particles can stay in arcs for longer
time and therefore are more likely to collide with the source moon.

Geyer (1992) shows that discarding $k-1$ out of every $k$ observations will not
improve statistical efficiency, as quantified through variance in a given
computational budget. That observation is often taken to mean that thinning
MCMC output cannot improve statistical efficiency. Here we suppose that it
costs one unit of time to advance a Markov chain and then $\theta>0$ units of
time to compute a sampled quantity of interest. For a thinned process, that
cost $\theta$ is incurred less often, so it can be advanced through more
stages. Here we provide examples to show that thinning will improve statistical
efficiency if $\theta$ is large and the sample autocorrelations decay slowly
enough. If the lag $\ell\ge1$ autocorrelations of a scalar measurement satisfy
$\rho_\ell\ge\rho_{\ell+1}\ge0$, then there is always a $\theta<\infty$ at
which thinning becomes more efficient for averages of that scalar. Many sample
autocorrelation functions resemble first order AR(1) processes with $\rho_\ell
=\rho^{|\ell|}$ for some $-1<\rho<1$. For an AR(1) process it is possible to
compute the most efficient subsampling frequency $k$. The optimal $k$ grows
rapidly as $\rho$ increases towards $1$. The resulting efficiency gain depends
primarily on $\theta$, not $\rho$. Taking $k=1$ (no thinning) is optimal when
$\rho\le0$. For $\rho>0$ it is optimal if and only if $\theta \le
(1-\rho)^2/(2\rho)$. This efficiency gain never exceeds $1+\theta$. This paper
also gives efficiency bounds for autocorrelations bounded between those of two
AR(1) processes.

the 320-km wide Encke gap in Saturn's rings (Porco et al., 2005). The ringlet
is mainly composed of micron-sized particles (Showalter, 1991, Hedman et al.,
2011), implying that these particles may be significantly perturbed by
non-gravitational forces, which can limit their lifetimes. We establish a
kinetic model considering the birth, evolution, and death of dust in the Encke
central ringlet allowing to evaluate the ringlet optical depth. First, we
investigate the generation of dust by micrometeorite impacts (the
`impact-ejecta' process) on putative, yet undetected embedded moonlets. Taking
into account the orbital evolution under the influence of the relevant
perturbation forces, the dominant loss mechanisms are collisions with ring
particles in the gap edges, the putative moonlets in the gap, or erosion by
sputtering in Saturn's plasma environment. However, our results show that this
impact-ejecta process alone can only sustain a ringlet of optical depth 3-4
orders of magnitude smaller than the observed values. Consequently, other
processes must be taken into account. For example, mutual collisions among
putative moonlets should produce dust at about the same rate, while further
disruption of ejecta, as proposed by Dikarev (1999), should increase the total
amount of particles. Furthermore, observations show an azimuthal asymmetry of
the material in the Encke gap ringlets (Ferrari and Brahic 1997, M.
Srem\v{c}evi\'c, private communication). We investigate the scenario proposed
by Hedman et al. (2013) that for the Encke central ringlet, the observed
asymmetry is mainly due to the combined action of plasma drag and Pan's gravity
causing a focusing of dust in the region leading Pan's orbit (Hedman et al.

the swim speed and $\tau_R$ is the reorientation time of the active particles.
The theory has a natural microscopic length scale over which concentration and
orientation distributions are confined near boundaries, but the microscopic

that the curvature with respect to the chemical potential is positive. This

tunneling conductance with SC leads of spin-orbit coupled
semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructures in the presence of a
Zeeman field, a system which has been extensively studied both theoretically
and experimentally using a metallic lead. We examine the $dI/dV$ spectra using
a SC lead for different sets of physical parameters including temperature,
tunneling strength, wire length, magnetic field, and induced SC pairing
potential in the SM nanowire. We conclude that in a finite wire the Majorana
splitting energy $\Delta E$, which has non-trivial dependence on these physical
parameters, remains responsible for the $dI/dV$ peak broadening, even when the
temperature broadening is suppressed by the SC gap in the lead. In a finite
wire the signatures of Majorana fermions with a SC lead are oscillations of
quasi-Majorana peaks about bias $V=\pm\Delta_{\text{lead}}$, in contrast to the
case of metallic leads where such oscillations are about zero bias. Our results
will be useful for analysis of future experiments on SM-SC heterostructures

scales. We break down the complexity of the problem and show that the hierarchy
of structures in natural images fuels a new class of learning algorithms based
on the theory of critical phenomena and stochastic processes. We approach this
problem from the perspective of the theory of critical phenomena, which was
developed in condensed matter physics to address problems with infinite
length-scale fluctuations, and build a framework to integrate the criticality
of natural images into a learning algorithm. The problem is broken down by
mapping images into a hierarchy of binary images, called bitplanes. In this
representation, the top bitplane is critical, having fluctuations in structures
over a vast range of scales. The bitplanes below go through a gradual
stochastic heating process to disorder. We turn this representation into a
directed probabilistic graphical model, transforming the learning problem into
the unsupervised learning of the distribution of the critical bitplane and the
supervised learning of the conditional distributions for the remaining
bitplanes. We learnt the conditional distributions by logistic regression in a
convolutional architecture. Conditioned on the critical binary image, this
simple architecture can generate large, natural-looking images, with many
shades of gray, without the use of hidden units, unprecedented in the studies

bulge stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{e}$ was determined from the
underlying stellar spectra. We compared our results with the existing BH mass -
velocity dispersion ($M_{BH}-\sigma_{e}$) correlations and found that the
majority of our sample lie in the low BH mass regime and below the
$M_{BH}-\sigma_{e}$ correlation. We analysed the effects of any systematic bias

of $\sigma_e$ and the increase of $\sigma_e$ due to the presence of bars and
found that these effects are insufficient to explain the observed offset in

BHs which probably are not in co-evolution with the host galaxy bulges. A
detailed study of the nature of the bulges and the role of dark matter in the

partitions as a summary graph. A query is decomposed into subqueries that can
be answered without inter-partition processing. The final results are derived
by perform summary graph matching and join the results generated by all matched
subqueries. In essence, SGDQ combines the merits of graph match processing and
relational join-based query implementation. It intentionally avoids maintain
huge intermediate results by organizing sub-query processing in a summary graph
driven fashion. Our extensive evaluations show that SGDQ is an effective
framework for efficient RDF query processing. Its query performance
consistently outperforms the representative state-of-the-art systems.

of -0.010 to -0.002 dex kpc-1, and dispersions in the range 0.06-0.25 dex. The

multi-agent model, which is based on combinatorial effects of homophily and
heterophily, is developed to investigate the evolution of scientific

similar traits aggregate to form community by homophily, while heterophily
plays a major role in the formation of inter-communal links. The pattern of
network evolution revealed in simulations is essentially consistent with what
is observed in empirical analyses, as in both cases the giant component evolves
from a small cluster to a structure of chained-communities, and then to a small

view on the underlying mechanisms for the formation of community and small

high-mass gamma-ray binary PSR B1259-63, which contains a non-accreting pulsar
and a Be star whose winds collide forming a complex interaction structure.
Given the strong eccentricity of this binary, the interaction structure should
be strongly anisotropic, which together with the complex evolution of the
shocked winds, could explain the origin of the observed moving X-ray feature.
We propose here that a fast outflow made of a pulsar-stellar wind mixture is
always present moving away from the binary in the apastron direction, with the
injection of stellar wind occurring at orbital phases close to periastron
passage. This outflow periodically loaded with stellar wind would move with a
high speed, and likely host non-thermal activity due to shocks, on scales
similar to those of the observed moving X-ray object. Such an outflow is thus a
very good candidate to explain this X-ray feature. This, if confirmed, would
imply pulsar-to-stellar wind thrust ratios of $\sim 0.1$, and the presence of a
jet-like structure on the larger scales, up to its termination in the ISM.

solutions? To answer this question, the 5-point central difference scheme is
applied to the semi-linear wave equation. A travelling wave ansatz leads to an
ordinary difference equation, whose solutions correspond to the numerical
scheme and can be compared to travelling wave solutions of the corresponding
PDE. For a discontinuous nonlinearity the difference equation is solved
exactly. For continuous nonlinearities the difference equation is solved using
a Fourier series, and resonances that depend on the grid-size are revealed for
a smooth nonlinearity. In general, the infinite dimensional functional
equation, which must be solved to get the travelling wave solutions, is
intractable, but backward error analysis proves to be a powerful tool, as it
provides a way to study the solutions of the equation through a simple ODE that
describes the behavior to arbitrarily high order. A general framework for using
backward error analysis to analyze preservation of travelling waves for other
equations and discretisations is presented. Then, the advantages that
multisymplectic methods have over other methods are briefly highlighted.

$d=\Omega(\log n)$, we want to design a decentralized, local algorithm that
transforms the graph into one that has good connectivity properties (low
diameter, expansion, etc.) without affecting the sparsity of the graph. To this
end, Mahlmann and Schindelhauer introduced the random ""flip"" transformation,
where in each time step, a random pair of vertices that have an edge decide to
`swap a neighbor'. They conjectured that performing $O(n d)$ such flips at
random would convert any connected $d$-regular graph into a $d$-regular
expander graph, with high probability. However, the best known upper bound for
the number of steps is roughly $O(n^{17} d^{23})$, obtained via a delicate
Markov chain comparison argument.
  Our main result is to prove that a natural instantiation of the random flip
produces an expander in at most $O(n^2 d^2 \sqrt{\log n})$ steps, with high
probability. Our argument uses a potential-function analysis based on the
matrix exponential, together with the recent beautiful results on the
higher-order Cheeger inequality of graphs. We also show that our technique can
be used to analyze another well-studied random process known as the `random
switch', and show that it produces an expander in $O(n d)$ steps with high
probability.

highly tangled magnetic fields, we derive the perturbation equations. We assume
that the field strength of the global magnetic structure is so small that such
fields are negligible compared with tangled fields, which may still be far from
a realistic configuration. Then, we systematically examine the spectra of the
magnetic oscillations, as varying the magnetic field strength and stellar mass.
The frequencies without crust elasticity are completely proportional to the
strength of the magnetic field, whose proportionality constant depends strongly
on the stellar mass. On the other hand, the oscillation spectra with crust
elasticity become more complicated, where the frequencies even for weak
magnetic fields are different from the crustal torsional oscillations without
magnetic fields. For discussing spectra, the critical field strength can play
an important role, and it is determined in such a way that the shear velocity
is equivalent to the Alfv\'{e}n velocity at the crust basis. Additionally, we
find that the effect of the crust elasticity can be seen strongly in the
fundamental oscillations with a lower harmonic index, $\ell$. Unlike the
stellar models with a pure dipole magnetic field, we also find that the spectra
with highly tangled magnetic fields become discrete, where one can expect many
of the eigenfrequencies. Maybe these frequencies could be detected after the
violent phenomena breaking the global magnetic field structure.

through an illustrative example, namely the Siah-1/beta-catenin/p14/19 ARF loop
of protein p53 dynamics. Its deterministic Boolean network model predicts that
two parallel pathways with comparable magnitudes of attractive basins should
exist after the protein p53 is activated when a cell becomes harmfully
disturbed. Once the low but non-neglectable intrinsic fluctuations are
incorporated into the model, we show that a phase transition phenomenon is
emerged: in one parameter region the probability weights of the normal pathway,
reported in experimental literature, are comparable with the other pathway
which is seemingly abnormal with the unknown functions, whereas, in some other
parameter regions, the probability weight of the abnormal pathway can even
dominate and become globally attractive. The theory of exponentially perturbed
Markov chains is applied and further generalized in order to quantitatively
explain such a phase transition phenomenon, in which the nonequilibrium
""activation energy barriers"" along each transiting trajectory between the
parallel pathways and the number of ""optimal transition paths"" play a central
part. Our theory can also determine how the transition time and the number of
optimal transition paths between the parallel pathways depend on each

  Astronomical Society (MNRAS)",,"10.1093/mnras/stv2458",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new technique for the statistical evaluation of the Tully-Fisher
relation (TFR) using spectral line stacking. This technique has the potential
to extend TFR observations to lower masses and higher redshifts than possible
through a galaxy-by-galaxy analysis. It further avoids the need for individual
galaxy inclination measurements.
  To quantify the properties of stacked HI emission lines, we consider a
simplistic model of galactic disks with analytically expressible line profiles.
Using this model, we compare the widths of stacked profiles with those of
individual galaxies. We then follow the same procedure using more realistic
mock galaxies drawn from the S3-SAX model (a derivative of the Millennium
simulation). Remarkably, when stacking the apparent HI lines of galaxies with
similar absolute magnitude and random inclinations, the width of the stack is
very similar to the width of the deprojected (= corrected for inclination) and
dedispersed (= after removal of velocity dispersion) input lines. Therefore,
the ratio between the widths of the stack and the deprojected/dedispersed input
lines is approximately constant - about 0.93 - with very little dependence on
the gas dispersion, galaxy mass, galaxy morphology, and shape of the rotation
curve.
  Finally, we apply our technique to construct a stacked TFR using HIPASS data
which already has a well defined TFR based on individual detections. We obtain
a B-band TFR with a slope of $-8.5\pm0.4$ and a K-band relation with a slope of
$-11.7\pm0.6$ for the HIPASS data set which is consistent with the existing
results.

  Mining",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental
for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For
example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be
explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical
variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain
in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on
finite samples, the interpretability of their quantification and the accuracy
when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not
equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on
different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more
categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure
estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable
to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when
quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking
dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the
interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between
variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting
procedure in random forests.

and astrophysics. Simple arguments suggest that a scenario of supernova
remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way as the dominant sources for the cosmic ray
population below the knee could work: in a generic calculation, it can be shown
that these objects can provide the energy budget necessary to explain the
observed flux of cosmic rays. However, this argument is based on the assumption
that all sources behave in the same way, i.e.\ they all have the same energy
budget, spectral behavior and maximum energy. In this paper, we investigate if
a realistic population of SNRs is capable of producing the cosmic ray flux as
it is observed below the knee. We use 21 SNRs that are well-studied from radio
wavelengths up to gamma-ray energies. It could be shown previously (Mandelartz
& Becker Tjus 2015) that the high-energy bump in the energy spectrum of these
21 sources can be dominated by hadronic emission. Here, gamma-rays are produced
via $\pi^{0}-$decays from cosmic ray interactions in molecular clouds near the
supernova remnant, which serves as the cosmic ray accelerator. The cosmic ray
spectra show a large variety in their energy budget, spectral behavior and
maximum energy. These sources are assumed to be representative for the total
class of SNRs, where we assume that about 100 - 200 cosmic ray emitting SNRs
should be present today. Finally, we use these source spectra to simulate the
cosmic ray transport from individual SNRs in the Galaxy with the GALPROP code
for cosmic ray propagation. We find that the cosmic ray budget can be matched
well for a diffusion coefficient that is close to $D\propto E^{0.3}$. A
stronger dependence on the energy, e.g. $E^{0.5}$, would lead to a spectrum at
Earth that is too steep when compared to what is detected and the energy budget
cannot be matched, in particular toward high energies.

After characterization of their thermodynamic and elastic properties (using
Differential Scanning Calorimetry around the glass-transition temperature, and
measuring mass density and sound velocity), their specific heat was measured at
low and very low temperatures. By directly comparing pristine amber samples

(GRB) 140801A in the 137 deg$^2$ 3-$\sigma$ error-box of the Fermi Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM). MASTER is the only observatory that automatically react to
all Fermi alerts. GRB 140801A is one of the few GRBs whose optical counterpart
was discovered solely from its GBM localization. The optical afterglow of GRB
140801A was found by MASTER Global Robotic Net 53 sec after receiving the
alert, making it the fastest optical detection of a GRB from a GBM error-box.
Spectroscopy obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the 6-m BTA
of SAO RAS reveals a redshift of $z=1.32$. We performed optical and
near-infrared photometry of GRB 140801A using different telescopes with
apertures ranging from 0.4-m to 10.4-m. GRB 140801A is a typical burst in many
ways. The rest-frame bolometric isotropic energy release and peak energy of the
burst is $E_\mathrm{iso} = 5.54_{-0.24}^{+0.26} \times 10^{52}$ erg and
$E_\mathrm{p, rest}\simeq280$ keV, respectively, which is consistent with the
Amati relation. The absence of a jet break in the optical light curve provides
a lower limit on the half-opening angle of the jet $\theta=6.1$ deg. The
observed $E_\mathrm{peak}$ is consistent with the limit derived from the
Ghirlanda relation. The joint Fermi GBM and Konus-Wind analysis shows that GRB
140801A could belong to the class of intermediate duration. The rapid detection
of the optical counterpart of GRB 140801A is especially important regarding the
upcoming experiments with large coordinate error-box areas.

to investigate the effects of intercalibrating data from observers with
different visual acuities. The tests are made by counting the number of groups
$R_B$ above a variable cut-off threshold of observed total whole-spot area
(uncorrected for foreshortening) to simulate what a lower acuity observer would
have seen. The synthesised annual means of $R_B$ are then re-scaled to the
observed RGO group number $R_A$ using a variety of regression techniques. It is
found that a very high correlation between $R_A$ and $R_B$ ($r_{AB}$ > 0.98)
does not prevent large errors in the intercalibration (e.g. sunspot maximum
values can be over 30% too large even for such levels of $r_{AB}$). In
generating the backbone sunspot number, Svalgaard and Schatten [2015] force
regression fits to pass through the scatter plot origin which generates
unreliable fits (the residuals do not form a normal distribution) and causes
sunspot cycle amplitudes to be exaggerated in the intercalibrated data. It is
demonstrated that the use of Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots to test for a normal
distribution is a useful indicator of erroneous and misleading regression fits.
Ordinary least squares linear fits, not forced to pass through the origin, are
sometimes reliable (although the optimum method used is shown to be different
when matching peak and average sunspot group numbers). However other fits are
only reliable if non-linear regression is used. From these results it is
entirely possible that the inflation of solar cycle amplitudes in the backbone
group sunspot number as one goes back in time, relative to related
solar-terrestrial parameters, is entirely caused by the use of inappropriate
and non-robust regression techniques to calibrate the sunspot data.

derive hierarchically from a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), or are
stochastic transitions that mutate differentiated cancer cells to CSCs
important? Here we argue that regulation must also be important. We sort human
melanoma cells using three distinct cancer stem cell (CSC) markers - CXCR6,
CD271 and ABCG2 - and observe that the fraction of non-CSC-marked cells first
overshoots to a higher level and then returns to the level of unsorted cells.
This clearly indicates that the CSC population is homeostatically regulated.
Combining experimental measurements with theoretical modeling and numerical
simulations, we show that the population dynamics of cancer cells is associated
with a complex miRNA network regulating the Wnt and PI3K pathways. Hence
phenotypic switching is not stochastic, but is tightly regulated by the balance
between positive and negative cells in the population. Reducing the fraction of
CSCs below a threshold triggers massive phenotypic switching, suggesting that a
therapeutic strategy based on CSC eradication is unlikely to succeed.

level-2 links, which are links between common-neighbors, most classical
similarity indices can be improved. Nevertheless, calculating the number of
level-2 links makes CAR index not efficient enough. Inspired by the idea of
employing local link/triangle information, we propose a new similarity index
with more local structure information. In our method, local link/triangle
structure information can be conveyed by clustering coefficient of common
neighbors directly. The reason why clustering coefficient has good
effectiveness in estimating the contribution of a common-neighbor is because
that it employs links existing between neighbors of the common-neighbor and
these links have the same structural position with the candidate link to this
common-neighbor. Ten real-world networks drawn from five various fields are
used to test the performance of our method against to classical similarity
indices and recently proposed CAR index. Two estimators: precision and AUP, are
used to evaluate the accuracy of link prediction algorithms. Generally
speaking, our new index only performs competitively with CAR, but it is a good
complement to CAR for networks with not very high LCP-corr, which is a measure
to estimate the correlation between number of common-neighbors and number of
links between common-neighbors. Besides, the proposed index is also more
efficient than CAR index.

$d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $X$ of special holonomy admitting gauge
instanton equations. Instantons are considered as particle-like solutions in
$d+1$ dimensions whose static configurations are concentrated on $X$. We study
how they evolve in time when considered as solutions of the Yang-Millsequations
on ${\mathbb R}\times X$ with moduli depending on time $t\in{\mathbb R}$. It is
shown that in the adiabatic limit, when the metric in the $X$ direction is
scaled down, the classical dynamics of slowly moving instantons corresponds to
a geodesic motion in the moduli space $\cal M$ of gauge instantons on $X$.
Similar results about geodesic motion in the moduli space of monopoles and
vortices in higher dimensions are briefly discussed.

have progressed rapidly in recent years. Bringing them together is an important
step in advancing our knowledge about the earliest phases of star formation.
  Aims: To compare synthetic continuum images and SEDs, calculated from
large-scale numerical simulations, to observational studies, thereby aiding in
both the interpretation of the observations and in testing the fidelity of the
simulations.
  Methods: The radiative transfer code RADMC-3D is used to create synthetic
continuum images and SEDs of protostellar systems in a large numerical
simulation of a molecular cloud. More than 13000 unique radiative transfer
models are produced of a variety of different protostellar systems.
  Results: Over the course of 0.76 Myr the simulation forms more than 500
protostars, primarily within two sub-clusters. Synthetic SEDs are used to the
calculate evolutionary tracers Tbol and Lsmm/Lbol. It is shown that, while the
observed distributions of the tracers are well matched by the simulation, they
generally do a poor job of tracking the protostellar ages. Disks form early in
the simulation, with 40 % of the Class 0 protostars being encircled by one. The
flux emission from the simulated disks is found to be, on average, a factor of
6 too low relative to real observations. The distribution of protostellar
luminosities spans more than three order of magnitudes, similar to the observed
distribution. Cores and protostars are found to be closely associated with one
another, with the distance distribution between them being in excellent
agreement with observations.
  Conclusions: The analysis and statistical comparison of synthetic
observations to real ones is established as a powerful tool in the
interpretation of observational results.

  Possibilities of study at X-ray free electron lasers","Text in Russian",,,,"cond-mat.soft q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under prolonged starvation, the nucleoid of E. coli bacteria forms
nanocrystalline complexes with the protein Dps. By one hypothesis, this effect
is considered to be a manifestation of a general strategy of self-preservation
of living organisms under adverse conditions by forming stable ordered
structures which do not require consumption of energy for maintaining the
order. The effect of nucleoid biocrystallization in starved bacteria has been
investigated in a number of studies using electron microscopy. However, this
method did not answer all questions regarding the structure of the
nanocrystals, and, primarily, the question of the true conformation of DNA in
these complexes. This issue is particularly important because it is related to
a more general, actively researched topic of organization of the genetic
material, which affects gene expression and is thus critical for the
functioning of organisms. The intracellular DNA-Dps nanocrystals have the size
in the range of hundreds of nanometers and are thus particularly suitable for
study at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). In this paper, we discuss the
possible configurations of XFEL experiments aimed at determining the
conformation of DNA in the DNA-Dps nanocrystals grown in vivo and in vitro, as
well as the specific features and challenges associated with this type of
sample. We conclude that the XFEL technique has a high potential for uncovering
the structural details of bacterial nucleoid restructuring under stress.

that the full potential of solid state lighting could be exploited only by

Such an approach requires direct emitting LEDs of different colors, in
particular in the green/yellow range ov the visible spectrum. This range,
however, suffers from a systematic drop in efficiency, known as the ""green

decrease in the radiative recombination coefficient with increasing Indium
content due to random fluctuations of the Indium concentration naturally
present in any InGaN alloy.

relativistically blurred disk emission, a powerlaw, a broad Iron line, two
narrow emission lines and two edges. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation
technique and the relativistic effects seen in the disk and broad Iron line
allow us to self-consistently constrain the inner disk radius, disk inclination
angle and distance to the source at 2.43$^{+0.39}_{-0.17}$ R$_g$ (GM/c$^2$),
69.5$^{+12.8}_{-4.2}$ degrees and 10.8$^{+1.6}_{-2.5}$ kpc respectively. For
the hard state, the spectrum is a power-law with a weakly broad Iron line and
an edge. The distance estimate gives a measure of the Eddington fraction,
$L_{2.0 - 80.0 keV}/L_{Edd}$, to be $\sim$1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ and $\sim$1.9
$\times$ 10$^{-3}$ for the soft and hard states respectively. Unlike many other
typical black hole systems which are always in a hard state at such low
Eddington fraction, V4641 Sgr shows a soft, disk dominated state. The soft
state spectrum shows narrow emission lines at $\sim 6.95$ and $\sim 8.31$ keV

Nickel in an X$-$ray irradiated wind respectively. If not due to instrumental

toward exact results upon increasing the number of modes. Convergence is
difficult to ascertain in practice due to the unfavourable scaling of required
resources for many-particle problems and therefore a simplified criterion based
on a threshold value for the least occupied mode function is often used. Here
we show how the separable quantum motion of the center of mass can be used to
sensitively detect unconverged numerical multi-particle dynamics in harmonic
potentials. Based on an experimentally relevant example of attractively
interacting bosons in one dimension, we demonstrate that the simplified
convergence criterion fails to assure qualitatively correct results.
Furthermore, the numerical evidence for the creation of two-hump fragmented
bright soliton-like states presented by Streltsov \emph{et al.} [PRL 100,

mode in heavy nuclei. Microscopic density functional studies of fission have
previously concentrated on adiabatic approaches based on constrained static
calculations ignoring dynamical excitations of the fissioning nucleus, and the
daughter products.
  Purpose: To explore the ability of dynamic mean-field methods to describe
induced fission processes, using quadrupole boosts in the nuclide $^{240}$Pu as
an example.
  Methods: Quadrupole constrained Hartree-Fock calculations are used to create
a potential energy surface. An isomeric state and a state beyond the second
barrier peak are excited by means of instantaneous as well as temporally
extended gauge boosts with quadrupole shapes. The subsequent deexcitation is
studied in a time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulation, with emphasis on fissioned
final states. The corresponding fission fragment mass numbers are studied.
  Results: In general, the energy deposited by the quadrupole boost is quickly
absorbed by the nucleus. In instantaneous boosts, this leads to fast shape
rearrangements and violent dynamics that can ultimately lead to fission. This
is a qualitatively different process than the deformation-induced fission.
Boosts induced within a finite time window excite the system in a relatively
gentler way, and do induce fission but with a smaller energy deposition.
  Conclusions: The fission products obtained using boost-induced fission in
time-dependent Hartree-Fock are more asymmetric than the fragments obtained in
deformation-induced fission, or the corresponding adiabatic approaches.

occurrence of the wide spreading regime, thus representing a predictor of the

history of the disease and on the pattern of contacts of the network with its
time variation. Based on the theoretical framework introduced in (Valdano et
al. PRX 2015) for a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model, we formulate here
an infection propagator approach to compute the epidemic threshold accounting
for more realistic effects regarding a varying force of infection per contact,
the presence of immunity, and a limited time resolution of the temporal
network. We apply the approach to two temporal network models and an empirical
dataset of school contacts. We find that permanent or temporary immunity do not
affect the estimation of the epidemic threshold through the infection
propagator approach. Comparisons with numerical results show the good agreement
of the analytical predictions. Aggregating the temporal network rapidly
deteriorates the predictions, except for slow diseases once the heterogeneity
of the links is preserved. Weight-topology correlations are found to be the
critical factor to be preserved to improve accuracy in the prediction.

still a difficult open problem. Currently, best results are generally obtained
by the so-called meta-analysis approach, which aggregates results from
individual datasets, instead of analyzing aggre-gated datasets. In order to
tackle such aggregation problems, it is necessary to correct for interstudy
variability prior to aggregation. The goal of this paper is to present a new
approach for microarray datasets merging, based upon explicit modeling of
interstudy variability and gene variability. We develop and demonstrate a new
algorithm for microarray datasets merging. The underlying model assumes
normally distributed intrinsic gene expressions, distorted by a study-dependent
nonlinear transformation, and study dependent (normally distributed)
observation noise. The algorithm addresses both parameter estimation (the
parameters being gene expression means and variances, observation noise
variances and the nonlinear transformations) and data adjustment, and yields as
a result adjusted datasets suitable for aggregation. The method is validated on
two case studies. The first one concerns E. Coli expression data, artificially
distorted by given nonlinear transformations and additive observation noise.
The proposed method is able to correct for the distortion, and yields adjusted
datasets from which the relevant biological effects can be recovered, as shown
by a standard differential analysis. The second case study concerns the
aggregation of two real prostate cancer datasets. After adjustment using the
proposed algorithm, a differential analysis performed on adjusted datasets
yields a larger number of differentially expressed genes (between control and
tumor data). The proposed method has been implemented using the statistical
software R 1, and Bioconductor packages 2. The source code (valid for merging
two datasets), as well as the datasets used for the validation, and some

By combining the complex scaling method with the relativistic mean-field model,
the influence of the Coulomb exchange term on the single-proton resonances is
investigated by taking Sn isotopes and $N=82$ isotones as examples. It is found
that the Coulomb exchange term reduces the single-proton resonance energy
within the range of $0.4-0.6$ MeV, and lead to similar isotopic and isotonic
trends of the resonance energy as those without the Coulomb exchange term.
Moreover, the single-proton resonance width is also reduced by the Coulomb
exchange term, whose influence generally decreases with the increasing neutron
number and increases with the increasing proton number. However, the influence
of the Coulomb exchange term cannot change the trend of the resonance width
with respect to the neutron number and proton number. Furthermore, the
influence of the Coulomb exchange term on the resonance width is investigated
for the doubly magic nuclei $^{40}$Ca, $^{56,78}$Ni, $^{100,132}$Sn, and

on Hamilton's law of varying action. From the action of the continuous system
we derive a spatially and temporally weak form of the governing equilibrium
equations. This expression is first discretized in space, considering standard
finite elements. The resulting system is then discretized in time,
approximating the displacement by piecewise cubic Hermite shape functions.
Within the time domain we thus achieve C1-continuity for the displacement field
and C0-continuity for the velocity field. From the discrete virtual action we
finally construct a class of one-step schemes. These methods are examined both
analytically and numerically. Here, we study both linear and nonlinear systems
as well as inherently continuous and discrete structures. In the numerical
examples we focus on one-dimensional applications. The provided theory,
however, is general and valid also for problems in 2D or 3D. We show that the
most favorable candidate -- denoted as p2-scheme -- converges with order four.
Thus, especially if high accuracy of the numerical solution is required, this
scheme can be more efficient than methods of lower order. It further exhibits,
for linear simple problems, properties similar to variational integrators, such
as symplecticity. While it remains to be investigated whether symplecticity
holds for arbitrary systems, all our numerical results show an excellent
long-term energy behavior.

offloading probability for a two-tier wireless caching system, where the
helpers and a part of users have caching ability. The offloading comes from the
local caching, D2D sharing and the helper transmission. In particular, to
maximize the offloading probability we reformulate the caching placement
problem for users and helpers into a difference of convex (DC) problem which
can be effectively solved by DC programming. Moreover, we analyze the two
extreme cases where there is only help-tier caching network and only user-tier.
Specifically, the placement problem for the helper-tier caching network is
reduced to a convex problem, and can be effectively solved by the classical
water-filling method. We notice that users and helpers prefer to cache popular
contents under low node density and prefer to cache different contents evenly
under high node density. Simulation results indicate a great performance gain
of the proposed caching placement over existing approaches.

is elusive even for simple flow within pipes and rectangular channels. Unlike
the onset of temporal disorder, which is identified as the universal route to
chaos in confined flows, characterization of the onset of spatio-temporal
disorder has been an outstanding challenge because turbulent domains
irregularly decay or spread as they propagate downstream. Here, through
extensive experimental investigation of channel flow, we identify a distinctive
transition with critical behavior. Turbulent domains continuously injected from
an inlet ultimately decayed, or in contrast, spread depending on flow rates.
Near a transition point, critical behavior was observed. We investigate both
spatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent clusters, measuring four critical
exponents, a universal scaling function and a scaling relation, all in
agreement with the (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation universality class.

introduce an approximate KR algorithm, still capable to represent exactly the

of confining propagators do not change the ultraviolet behavior of the theory,
in the sense that no new ultraviolet primitive divergences are generated, thus
securing the renormalizability of these confining theories. We illustrate these
properties by studying a variety of models, including bosonic and fermionic

momenta of a charged particle moving in the magnetic field. In this paper,
proceeding from the universal character of that relation, the applicability of
Pendry's effective electron mass $m_{\text{eff}}$ to the problem of electrons

analogy between the effective electron mass $m_{\text{eff}}$ and $m^{\ast}$
known in the solid-state theory was established. A physical interpretation of
$m_{\text{eff}}$ was proposed. It was demonstrated in several examples that,
despite the generality of the defining relation for the effective mass
$m_{\text{eff}}$, the use of $m_{\text{eff}}$ beyond the problem of the
dielectric response of metal wire mesh structures leads to incorrect results.

Wavelet spectra of the wave trains have characteristic tadpole features, with

spherical $N=184$ gap. For these functionals (NL3*, DD-ME2 and PC-PK1), there
is a band of spherical nuclei along and near the $Z=120$ and $N=184$ lines.
However, for other functionals (DD-PC1 and DD-ME$\delta$) oblate shapes
dominate at and in the vicinity of these lines. Available experimental data are
in general described with comparable accuracy and do not allow to discriminate
these predictions.

boundary operators in AdS/CFT. In the presence of the wormhole dual to the
thermofield double state of two CFTs, the existence of bulk gauge fields is in
some tension with the microscopic tensor factorization of the Hilbert space. I
explain how this tension can be resolved by splitting the gauge field into
charged constituents, and I argue that this leads to a new argument for the
""principle of completeness"", which states that the charge lattice of a gauge
theory coupled to gravity must be fully populated. I also claim that it leads
to a new motivation for (and a clarification of) the ""weak gravity conjecture"",
which I interpret as a strengthening of this principle. This setup gives a
simple example of a situation where describing low-energy bulk physics in CFT
language requires knowledge of high-energy bulk physics. This contradicts to
some extent the notion of ""effective conformal field theory"", but in fact is an
expected feature of the resolution of the black hole information problem. An
analogous factorization issue exists also for the gravitational field, and I
comment on several of its implications for reconstructing black hole interiors
and the emergence of spacetime more generally.

significant scattering from one spin state into the other and the reference

offers two main contributions from the optimization perspective: 1) We provide
several efficient algorithms to solve exclusive sparsity norm minimization with

optimal convergence rate $O(1/k^2)$ ($k$ is the iteration number). To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time to guarantee such convergence rate for
the general exclusive sparsity norm minimization; 2) When the group information

the sustainability of power-constrained wireless devices. This paper considers
the co-channel deployment of a macrocell overlaid with small cells. The small
cell base stations (SBSs) harvest energy from environmental sources whereas the
macrocell base station (MBS) uses conventional power supply. Given a stochastic
energy arrival process for the SBSs, we derive a power control policy for the
downlink transmission of both MBS and SBSs such that they can achieve their
objectives (e.g., maintain the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
at an acceptable level) on a given transmission channel. We consider a
centralized energy harvesting mechanism for SBSs, i.e., there is a central
energy storage (CES) where energy is harvested and then distributed to the
SBSs. When the number of SBSs is small, the game between the CES and the MBS is
modeled as a single-controller stochastic game and the equilibrium policies are
obtained as a solution of a quadratic programming problem. However, when the
number of SBSs tends to infinity (i.e., a highly dense network), the
centralized scheme becomes infeasible, and therefore, we use a mean field
stochastic game to obtain a distributed power control policy for each SBS. By
solving a system of partial differential equations, we derive the power control

achieves a long standing goal of removing entirely any cosmological constant

which dark energy is due to massive gravity and its extensions. We show how the

formulation of massive gravity. This is achieved in a framework where the other
universe is described by 5D AdS gravity, while our universe lives on its
boundary and is endowed with dynamical massive gravity. A non-dynamical
pullback of the bulk AdS metric acts as the fiducial metric for massive gravity
on the boundary. This framework also removes a difficulty caused by the quantum
strongly coupled behavior of massive gravity at the Lambda3 scale: in the
present approach, the massive gravity action does not receive any loop-induced
counterterms, despite being strongly coupled.

the different detection rates between low mass and high mass pre-main-sequence
stars (PMSs) in the mid-IR regime. We run disk models with stellar parameters
adjusted to spectral types B9 through M2, using the radiation thermo-chemical
disk modeling code ProDiMo. We produce convolved spectra at the resolution of
Spitzer IRS, JWST MIRI and VLT VISIR spectrographs. We apply random noise
derived from typical Spitzer spectra for a direct comparison with observations.
The strength of the mid-IR water lines correlates directly with the luminosity
of the central star. We explored a small parameter space around a standard disk
model, considering dust-to-gas mass ratio, disk gas mass, mixing coefficient
for dust settling, flaring index, dust maximum size and size power law
distribution index. The models show that it is possible to suppress the water
emission, however, current observations are not sensitive enough to detect
mid-IR lines in disks for most of the explored parameters. The presence of
noise in the spectra, combined with the high continuum flux (noise level is
proportional to the continuum flux), is the most likely explanation for the non
detections towards Herbig stars. Mid-IR spectra with resolution higher than
20000 are needed to investigate water in protoplanetary disks. Intrinsic
differences in disk structure, e.g. inner gaps, gas-to-dust ratio, dust size
and distribution, and inner disk scale height, between Herbig and TTauri star
disks are able to explain a lower water detection rate in disks around Herbig
stars.

carried out fully in practice. In its place roughly twenty years ago,
linearized wave packet dynamics was generalized to methods that include sets of
off-center, real trajectories for both classically integrable and chaotic
dynamical systems that completely capture the dynamical transport. The
connections between those methods and GGWPD are developed in a way that enables
a far more practical implementation of GGWPD. The generally complex saddle
point trajectories at its foundation are found using a multi-dimensional,
Newton-Raphson root search method that begins with the set of off-center, real
trajectories. This is possible because there is a one-to-one correspondence.
The neighboring trajectories associated with each off-center, real trajectory
form a path that crosses a unique saddle; there are exceptions which are
straightforward to identify. The method is applied to the kicked rotor to
demonstrate the accuracy improvement as a function of $\hbar$ that comes with
using the saddle point trajectories.

observations that risk to remain unexplored. To maximise the science return of
the SPIRE and PACS data sets, we are in the process of building the Herschel
Point Source Catalogue (HPSC) from all primary and parallel mode observations.
Our homogeneous source extraction enables a systematic and unbiased comparison
of sensitivity across the different Herschel fields that single programs will
generally not be able to provide. The catalogue will be made available online
through archives like the Herschel Science Archive (HSA), the Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA), and the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center (CDS).

this paper, we numerically confirm that, although with a disformal redefinition
of the metric the nontrivial $c_T$ may be set as unity, the power spectrum in
the frame with $c_T=1$ is completely the same as that in the original disformal
frame, i.e., the oscillating shape in the power spectrum is still reserved,
since here the effect of $c_T$ is actually encoded in the nontrivially varying
Hubble parameter. In addition, we also clarify how to obtain a blue-tilted GWs
spectrum by imposing a rapidly decreasing $c_T$ during inflation.

  measurement-models: a case study for IRMS evaluation","36 pages including 2 Tables",,,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The suitability of a mathematical-model Y = f({Xi}) in serving a purpose
whatsoever (should be preset by the function f specific input-to-output
variation-rates, i.e.) can be judged beforehand. We thus evaluate here the two
apparently similar models: YA = fA(SRi,WRi) = (SRi/WRi) and: YD = fd(SRi,WRi) =
([SRi,WRi] - 1) = (YA - 1), with SRi and WRi representing certain
measurable-variables (e.g. the sample S and the working-lab-reference W
specific ith-isotopic-abundance-ratios, respectively, for a case as the isotope
ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)). The idea is to ascertain whether fD should
represent a better model than fA, specifically, for the well-known IRMS
evaluation.
  The study clarifies that fA and fD should really represent different
model-families. For example, the possible variation, eA, of an absolute
estimate as the yA (and/ or the risk of running a machine on the basis of the
measurement-model fA) should be dictated by the possible
Ri-measurement-variations (u_S and u_W) only: eA = (u_S + u_W); i.e., at worst:
eA = 2ui. However, the variation, eD, of the corresponding differential (i.e.
YD) estimate yd should largely be decided by SRi and WRi values: ed = 2(|m_i |x
u_i) = (|m_i | x eA); with: mi = (SRi/[SRi - WRi]).
  Thus, any IRMS measurement (i.e. for which |SRi - WRi| is nearly zero is a
requirement) should signify that |mi| tends to infinity. Clearly, yD should be
less accurate than yA, and/ or even turn out to be highly erroneous (eD tends
to infinity). Nevertheless, the evaluation as the absolute yA, and hence as the
sample isotopic ratio Sri, is shown to be equivalent to our previously reported
finding that the conversion of a D-estimate (here, yD) into Sri should help to
improve the achievable output-accuracy and -comparability.

problem of the world. Nowadays, no effective treatment is available to overcome
the disease due to the level of dengue virus pathogeneses. A novel treatment
method such as antiviral drug is highly necessary for coping with the dengue
disease. Envelope protein is one of the non-structural proteins of DENV, which
engaged in the viral fusion process. The fusion process is mediated by the
conformational change in the protein structure from dimer to trimer state. The
previous research showed the existing cavity on the dimer structure of the
envelope protein. The existing ligand could get into cavity of the envelope
protein, stabilize the dimer structure or hamper the transition of dimer
protein into trimer. In this fashion, the fusion process can be prevented. The
aim of this research is designing the cyclic peptide with prolin-prolin bond as
fusion inhibitor of DENV envelope protein through molecular docking and
molecular dynamics simulation. The screening of 3,883 cyclic peptides, each of
them connected by prolin-prolin bond, through molecular docking resulted in
five best ligands. The pharmacological and toxicity character of these five
ligands were analised in silico. The result showed that PYRRP was the best
ligand. PAWRP was also chosen as the best ligand because it showed good
affinity with protein cavity. Stability of ligand-protein complex was analyzed
by molecular dynamics simulation. The result showed that PYRRP ligand was able
to support the stability of DENV envelope protein dimer structure at 310 K and
312 K. While PAWRP ligand actively formed complex with the DENV envelope
protein at 310 K compared to 312 K. Thus the PYRRP ligand has a potential to be
developed as DENV fusion inhibitor.

spectral Planckianity of the asymptotic Hawking modes in the conventional
treatments of the evaporating horizons. By considering an observer who analyzes
a causal horizon in a generic spacetime, we first clarify how the asymptotic
Planckian spectrum is imposed on the exponentially redshifted Hawking modes
through a geometric dispersion mechanism developed by a semiclassical
environment which is composed by all the modes that build up the curvature of
the causal patch of the asymptotic observer. We also discuss the actual
microscopic phenomenon of the Hawking evaporation of generic causal horizons.
Our quantum description is based on a novel holographic scheme of gravitational
open quantum systems in which the degrees of freedom that build up the
curvature of the observer's causal patch interact with the radiated Hawking
modes, initially as environmental quanta, and after a crossover time, as
quantum defects. Planckian dispersion of the modes would only be developed in
the strict thermodynamic limit of this quantum environment, called optimal
disperser, which is nevertheless avoided holographically. Finally, we outline
and characterize how our microscopic formulation of the observer-centric
holography, beyond the AdS/CFT examples and for generic causal patches, does
realize the information-theoretic processing of unitarity.

It contains a term which provides a mechanism for frequency downshifting in the
absence of wind and wave breaking. The equation does not preserve the spectral

decreases and that the spectral peak decreases for certain initial conditions.
The linear stability analysis of the plane-wave solutions of the viscous Dysthe

slowly than waves with wave numbers further from zero. Comparisons between

  We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing

follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of
individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive
processes in the evolution of a system.
  The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system -- an ecology of
interacting social subsystems -- each of which is also a living cognitive
system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social
systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The
Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics
and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of
Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work.

social governance -- which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on
stable structures within global society.

small particles and R^-6 for large ones (2). The law R^-6 also describes
moonlets with size ~ 0.1-1 km. Cut-off law from Brilliantov et al. model does
not describe moonlets and requires new mechanism for the origin of ~ 1 km size
bodies. This model does not take into account the key effects of
self-gravitation of large particles and differential rotation of the rings.
Longaretti used a more accurate model of destruction of particles: ""A relative
increase of the erosion/destruction rate of the large particles must take
place, because these particles have relative velocities of collision larger
than the dispersion velocity, due to the differential Keplerian motion"". The
new model does not explain the difference between the rings and the satellites
and the authors suggest that their calculations are applicable to the rings of
the Chariklo and Chiron. In fact, the Chariklo rings are not examples of
planetary rings, but proto-satellite disks. Simplified physical model that does
not describe moonlets and the outer boundary of the rings makes the new model
not a step forward but a step backwards in comparison with the papers of 20-30
