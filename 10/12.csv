processes that requires better understanding in the view of molecular biology
and biological physics. Here we develop a stochastic dynamical model on the DNA
renaturation. According to our model there are at least three steps in the
renaturation process viz. incorrect-contact formation, correct-contact
formation and nucleation, and zipping. Most of the earlier two-state models
combined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we
suggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with
the zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated
and zipping molecules are indistinguishable. Incorrect-contact formation step
is a pure three-dimensional diffusion controlled collision process. Whereas
nucleation involves several rounds of one-dimensional slithering dynamics of
one single strand of DNA on the other complementary strand in the process of
searching for the correct-contact and then initiate nucleation. Upon
nucleation, the stochastic zipping follows to generate a fully renatured double
stranded DNA. It seems that the square-root dependency of the overall
renaturation rate constant on the length of reacting single strands originates
mainly from the geometric constraints in the diffusion controlled
incorrect-contact formation step. Further the inverse scaling of the
renaturation rate on the viscosity of the reaction medium also originates from
the incorrect-contact formation step. On the other hand the inverse scaling of
the renaturation rate with the sequence complexity originates from the
stochastic zipping which involves several rounds of crossing over the
free-energy barrier at microscopic levels.

to understanding the connection between planetary formation and disk dispersal.
The disk around the Herbig star HD 139614 is of particular interest since it
presents a pretransitional nature with an au-sized gap, in the dust, that was
spatially resolved by mid-IR interferometry. Using new NIR interferometric
observations, we aim to characterize the 0.1-10~au region of the HD~139614 disk
further and identify viable mechanisms for the inner disk clearing. We report
the first multiwavelength radiative transfer modeling of the interferometric
data acquired on HD~139614 with PIONIER, AMBER, and MIDI, complemented by
Herschel/PACS photometries. We confirm a gap structure in the um-sized dust,
extending from about 2.5 au to 6 au, and constrained the properties of the
inner dust component: e.g., a radially increasing surface density profile, and
a depletion of 10^3 relative to the outer disk. Since self-shadowing and
photoevaporation appears unlikely to be responsible for the au-sized gap of
HD~139614, we thus tested if dynamical clearing could be a viable mechanism
using hydrodynamical simulations to predict the gaseous disk structure. Indeed,
a narrow au-sized gap is expected when a single giant planet interacts with the
disk. Assuming that small dust grains are well coupled to the gas, we found
that a ~ 3~Mjup planet located at 4.5 au from the star could, in less than 1
Myr, reproduce most of the aspects of the dust surface density profile, while

dust. However, the dust-depleted inner disk could be explained by the expected
dust filtration by the gap and the efficient dust growth/fragmentation in the

opening a gap and shaping the inner region of the HD~139614 disk.

correlated quasi-plateaus in the collision energy dependence of the entropy per
baryon, total pion number per baryon, and thermal pion number per baryon which

alternative approaches. In this work, we mostly focus on an inpainting
algorithm that was introduced in recent CMB analyses to cure cut-sky
suboptimalities of bispectrum estimators. First, we show that inpainting can
equally be applied to the problem of unbiased estimation of power spectra. We
then compare the performance of a novel inpainted CMB temperature power
spectrum estimator to the popular apodised pseudo-$C_l$ (PCL) method and
demonstrate, both numerically and with analytic arguments, that inpainted power
spectrum estimates significantly outperform PCL estimates. Finally, we study
the case of cut-sky bispectrum estimators, comparing the performance of three
different approaches: inpainting, apodisation and a novel low-l leaning scheme.
Providing an analytic argument why the local shape is typically most affected
we mainly focus on local type non-Gaussianity. Our results show that inpainting
allows to achieve optimality also for bispectrum estimation, but interestingly
also demonstrate that appropriate apodisation, in conjunction with low-l
cleaning, can lead to comparable accuracy.

a constrained finite-time optimal estimation problem in real-time at each
sample in a receding horizon fashion. The constrained estimation problem can be
solved by, e.g., interior-point (IP) or active-set (AS) methods, where the main
computational effort in both methods is known to be the computation of the
search direction, i.e., the Newton step. This is often done using generic
sparsity exploiting algorithms or serial Riccati recursions, but as parallel
hardware is becoming more commonly available the need for parallel algorithms
for computing the Newton step is increasing. In this paper a tailored,
non-iterative parallel algorithm for computing the Newton step using the
Riccati recursion is presented. The algorithm exploits the special structure of
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system for the optimal estimation problem. As a result
it is possible to obtain logarithmic complexity growth in the estimation
horizon length, which can be used to reduce the computation time for IP and AS
methods when applied to what is today considered as challenging estimation
problems. Promising numerical results have been obtained using an ANSI-C
implementation of the proposed algorithm running on true parallel hardware.
Beyond MHE, due to similarities in the problem structure, the algorithm can be
applied to various forms of on-line and off-line smoothing problems.

and constrain the two distributions of mass ejection and kick velocities
directly from observations with no a-priori assumptions regarding evolutionary
models and/or the types of the supernovae involved. We show that there is
strong evidence for two distinct types of supernovae in these systems, where
the second collapse in the majority of the observed systems involved small mass
ejection ($\Delta M\lesssim 0.5M_{\odot}$) and a corresponding low-kick
velocity ($v_{k}\lesssim 30 $km\,s$^{-1}$). This formation scenario is
compatible, for example, with an electron capture supernova. Only a minority of
the systems have formed via the standard SN scenario involving larger mass
ejection of $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$ and kick velocities of up to
$400$km\,s$^{-1}$. Due to the typically small kicks in most DNS (which are
reflected by rather low proper motion), we predict that most of these systems
reside close to the galactic disc. In particular, this implies that more NS-NS
mergers occur close to the galactic plane. This may have non-trivial
implications to the estimated merger rates of DNS and to the rate of LIGO /

distribution of quarks in impact paarmeter space. For transversely polarized
nucleons, these impact parameter distributions are transversely distorted and
this deviation from axial symmetry leads on average to a net transverse force
from the spectators on the active quark in a DIS experiment. %The strength of
that force can be related to twist-3 PDFs. This force when acting along the
whole trajectory of the active quark leads to a transverse single-spin
asymmetries. For a longitudinally polarized nucleon target, the transverse
force implies a torque acting on the quark Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). The
resulting change in OAM as the quark leaves the target equals the difference
between the Jaffe-Manohar and Ji OAMs.

measuring stationary and non-stationary spectral phenomena and in describing
pairwise relationships among multiple signals. Although a variety of WFDs see
frequent application in electrophysiological research, including the short-time
Fourier transform, continuous wavelets, band-pass filtering and
multitaper-based approaches, each carries certain drawbacks related to
computational efficiency and spectral leakage. This work surveys the advantages
of a WFD not previously applied in electrophysiological settings.
  New Methods: A computationally efficient form of complex demodulation, the
demodulated band transform (DBT), is described.
  Results: DBT is shown to provide an efficient approach to spectral estimation
with minimal susceptibility to spectral leakage. In addition, it lends itself
well to adaptive filtering of non-stationary narrowband noise.
  Comparison with existing methods: A detailed comparison with alternative WFDs
is offered, with an emphasis on the relationship between DBT and Thomson's
multitaper. DBT is shown to perform favorably in combining computational
efficiency with minimal introduction of spectral leakage.
  Conclusion: DBT is ideally suited to efficient estimation of both stationary
and non-stationary spectral and cross-spectral statistics with minimal
susceptibility to spectral leakage. These qualities are broadly desirable in
many settings.

Compton scattering of external infrared photons from a surrounding dusty torus.
The curved $\gamma$-ray spectrum observed during 2-8 April 2014 is well
explained by the external Compton of dust radiation. It is found that there is
a clear positive correlation between the curvature parameter $b$ of the EED and
the electron peak energy $\gamma'_{\rm pk}$. No clear correlation between $b$
and the synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$ is found, due to the varied
product of Doppler factor and fluid magnetic field from state to state. We
interpret the correlation of $b-\gamma'_{\rm pk}$ in a stochastic acceleration
scenario. This positive correlation is in agreement with the prediction in the

dominate over the contribution of the band structure. We also extract the value
of layer-dependent exciton binding energy and Bohr radius in the films by
fitting the experimental results with an intuitive model. The dominance of
excitonic effects is in stark contrast with what reported at conventional

holes. Those works focus only on the region close to the black hole thus it is
unknown whether or where the wind production stops at large radii. In this
paper, we investigate this problem by hydrodynamical simulations. We take into
account gravities of both the black hole and the nuclear star clusters. For the
latter, we assume that the velocity dispersion of stars is a constant and its
gravitational potential $\propto \sigma^2 \ln (r)$, where $\sigma$ is the
velocity dispersion of stars and $r$ is the distance from the center of the
galaxy. We focus on the region where the gravitational potential is dominated
by the star cluster. We find, same as the accretion flow at small radii, the
mass inflow rate decreases inward and the flow is convectively unstable.
However, trajectory analysis shows that there is very few wind launched from
the flow. Our result, combined with the results of Yuan et al. (2015),
indicates that the mass flux of wind launched from hot accretion flow
$\dot{M}_{\rm wind}=\dot{M}_{\rm BH}(r/20r_s)$, with $r\la R_A\equiv GM_{\rm
BH}/\sigma^2$. Here $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ is accretion rate at black hole horizon.
$R_A$ is similar to Bondi radius. We argue that the inward decrease of inflow
rate is not because of mass loss via wind, but because of convective motion.
The disappearance of wind outside of $R_A$ must be because of the change of the
gravitational potential, but the exact reason remains to be probed.

environment information, which in- volves three phases: detection of objects of
interest, recognition of detected objects, and tracking of objects in motion.
Since recognition and tracking often rely on the results from detection, the
ability to detect objects of interest effectively plays a crucial role in TSP.
In this paper, we focus on three important classes of objects: traffic signs,
cars, and cyclists. We propose to detect all the three important objects in a
single learning based detection framework. The proposed framework consists of a
dense feature extractor and detectors of three important classes. Once the
dense features have been extracted, these features are shared with all
detectors. The advantage of using one common framework is that the detection
speed is much faster, since all dense features need only to be evaluated once
in the testing phase. In contrast, most previous works have designed specific
detectors using different features for each of these objects. To enhance the
feature robustness to noises and image deformations, we introduce spatially
pooled features as a part of aggregated channel features. In order to further
improve the generalization performance, we propose an object subcategorization
method as a means of capturing intra-class variation of objects. We
experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
framework in three detection applications: traffic sign detection, car
detection, and cyclist detection. The proposed framework achieves the
competitive performance with state-of- the-art approaches on several benchmark

manifold that serves as a reference spacetime in relativistic geodesy for
conducting relativistic calculation of the geoid's undulation and the
deflection of the plumb line from the vertical. We chose an axisymmetric
ellipsoidal body made up of perfect homogeneous fluid uniformly rotating around
a fixed axis, as a source generating the reference geometry. We, then,
reformulate and extend hydrodynamic calculations of rotating fluids done by
previous researchers to the realm of relativistic geodesy to set up algebraic
equations defining the shape of the post-Newtonian reference ellipsoid. To
complete this task, we explicitly perform all integrals characterizing
gravitational field inside the fluid body and represent them in terms of the
elementary functions depending on its eccentricity. We fully explore the
coordinate freedom of the equations describing the post-Newtonian ellipsoid and
demonstrate that the fractional deviation of the post-Newtonian level surface
from the Maclaurin ellipsoid can be made much smaller than the previously
anticipated estimate based on the coordinate gauge advocated by Bardeen and
Chandrasekhar. We also derive the gauge-invariant relations of the
post-Newtonian mass and the angular velocity of the rotating fluid with the
parameters characterizing the shape of the post-Newtonian ellipsoid. We
formulate the post-Newtonian theorems of Pizzetti and Clairaut that are used in
geodesy to connect the geometric parameters of the reference ellipsoid to the
physically measurable force of gravity at the pole and equator. Finally, we
expand the post-Newtonian geodetic equations to the Taylor series with respect
to the eccentricity of the ellipsoid and discuss their practical applications.

most theories of pulsar glitches. Pinning of vortices to ions can decouple the
superfluid from the crust and create a reservoir of angular momentum. Sudden
large scale unpinning can lead to an observable glitch. In this paper we
investigate the scattering of a free vortex off a pinning potential and
calculate its mean free path, in order to assess whether unpinned vortices can
skip multiple pinning sites and come close enough to their neighbours to
trigger avalanches, or whether they simply hop from one pinning site to another
giving rise to a more gradual creep. We find that there is a significant range
of parameter space in which avalanches can be triggered, thus supporting the
hypothesis that they may lie at the origin of pulsar glitches. For realistic
values of the pinning force and superfluid drag parameters we find that
avalanches are more likely in the higher density regions of the crust where
pinning is stronger. Physical differences in stellar parameters, such as mass
and temperature, may lead to a switch between creep-like motion and avalanches,
explaining the different characteristics of glitching pulsars.

spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the database community.
Specifically, the spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending location-based
requests to workers, based on their current positions. In this paper, we
consider a spatial crowdsourcing scenario, in which each worker has a set of
qualified skills, whereas each spatial task (e.g., repairing a house,
decorating a room, and performing entertainment shows for a ceremony) is
time-constrained, under the budget constraint, and required a set of skills.
Under this scenario, we will study an important problem, namely multi-skill
spatial crowdsourcing (MS-SC), which finds an optimal worker-and-task
assignment strategy, such that skills between workers and tasks match with each
other, and workers' benefits are maximized under the budget constraint. We
prove that the MS-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable. Therefore, we propose
three effective heuristic approaches, including greedy, g-divide-and-conquer
and cost-model-based adaptive algorithms to get worker-and-task assignments.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness

found both for observed ($L_{\rm [O~III]}$) and extinction-corrected ($L_{\rm

($<$0.5\%) scattering fractions in soft X-rays show on average smaller $L_{\rm

other absorbed AGNs, while those in edge-on host galaxies do not. These results
suggest that a significant fraction of this population are buried in tori with
small opening angles. By using these $L_{\rm [O~III]}$ vs. $L_{\rm X}$
correlations, the X-ray luminosity function of local AGNs (including Compton
thick AGNs) in a standard population synthesis model gives much better

incompressible flows with moving contact lines. We use a sharp interface
Navier-Stokes model for the bulk phase fluid dynamics. Surface tension forces,
including Marangoni forces and viscous interfacial effects, are modeled. For
describing the moving contact we consider a class of continuum models which
contains several special cases known from the literature. For the whole model,
describing bulk fluid dynamics, surface tension forces and contact line forces,
we derive a variational formulation and a corresponding energy estimate. For
handling the evolving interface numerically the level-set technique is applied.
The discontinuous pressure is accurately approximated by using a stabilized
extended finite element space (XFEM). We apply a Nitsche technique to weakly
impose the Navier slip conditions on the solid wall. A unified approach for
discretization of the (different types of) surface tension forces and contact
line forces is introduced. The numerical methods are first validated for
relatively simple test problems, namely a stationary spherical droplet in
contact with a flat wall and a spherical droplet on a flat wall that spreads or
contracts to a stationary form. A further validation is done for a two-phase
Couette flow with contact lines. To illustrate the robustness of our FEM we
also present results of simulations for a problem with a curved contact wall
and for a problem with more complicated contact line dynamics.

effectively managed through inter-cell interference coordination and,
therefore, is not considered in this work. Instead, we focus on the intra-cell
interference and propose a D2D mode selection scheme to manage it inside a
finite cellular network region. The potential D2D users are controlled by the
base station (BS) to operate in D2D mode based on the average interference
generated to the BS. Using stochastic geometry, we study the outage probability
experienced at the BS and a D2D receiver, and spectrum reuse ratio, which
quantifies the average fraction of successfully transmitting D2D users. The
analysis shows that the outage probability at the D2D receiver varies for
different locations. Additionally, without impairing the performance at the BS,
if the path-loss exponent on the cellular link is slightly lower than that on
the D2D link, the spectrum reuse ratio can have negligible decrease while the
D2D users' average number of successful transmissions increases with increasing
D2D node density. This indicates that an increasing level of D2D communication
can be beneficial in future networks..

proton rejection capability of 1:10^5 and an aperture of 1200 cm^2 sr, it will
provide good statistics even well above one TeV, while also featuring an energy
resolution of 2%, which allows it to detect fine structures in the spectrum.
Such structures may originate from Dark Matter annihilation or decay, making
indirect Dark Matter search one of CALET's main science objectives among others
such as identification of signatures from nearby supernova remnants, study of
the heavy nuclei spectra and gamma astronomy. The latest results from AMS-02 on
positron fraction and total electron+positron flux can be fitted with a
parametrization including a single pulsar as an extra power law source with
exponential cut-off, which emits an equal amount of electrons and positrons.
This single pulsar scenario for the positron excess is extrapolated into the
TeV region and the expected CALET data for this case are simulated. Based on
this prediction for CALET data, the sensitivity of CALET to Dark Matter
annihilation in the galactic halo has been calculated. It is shown that CALET
could significantly improve the limits compared to current data, especially for
those Dark Matter candidates that feature a large fraction of annihilation

procedures either allocate each agent a collection of disconnected pieces, or
assume that the cake is a one-dimensional interval. In practice, however, the
two-dimensional shape of the allotted pieces is important. In particular, when
building a house or designing an advertisement in printed or electronic media,
squares are more usable than long and narrow rectangles. We thus introduce and
study the problem of fair two-dimensional division wherein the allotted pieces
must be of some restricted two-dimensional geometric shape(s), particularly
squares and fat rectangles. Adding such geometric constraints re-opens most
questions and challenges related to cake-cutting. Indeed, even the most
elementary fairness criterion --- proportionality --- can no longer be
guaranteed. In this paper we thus examine the level of proportionality that can
be guaranteed, providing both impossibility results and constructive division
procedures.

generic properties of images near the fold and cusp catastrophes in caustics

magnification ratios and ellipticities of extended images, and time delays
between images with temporally varying intensity. We show how these observables
constrain derivatives and ratios of derivatives of the lensing potential near a
critical curve. Based on these measured properties of the lensing potential,
classes of parametric lens models can then easily be restricted to such
parameter values compatible with the measurements, thus allowing fast scans of
large varieties of models. Applying our approach to a representative galaxy
(JVAS B1422+231) and a galaxy-cluster lens (MACS J1149.5+2223), we show which
model-independent information can be extracted in those cases and demonstrate
that the parameters obtained by our approach for known parametric lens models
agree well with those found by detailed model fitting.

constant limits under which the concentrations of a given set of species will
tend to infinity (the abundant species) while the concentrations of all other

in this limit, the fluctuations in the molecule numbers of non-abundant species
are accurately described by a hybrid stochastic description consisting of a
chemical master equation coupled to deterministic rate equations. This is a
reduced description when compared to the conventional chemical master equation
which describes the fluctuations in both abundant and non-abundant species. We
show that the reduced master equation can be solved exactly for a number of
biochemical networks involving gene expression and enzyme catalysis, whose
conventional chemical master equation description is analytically impenetrable.
We use the linear noise approximation to obtain approximate expressions for the
difference between the variance of fluctuations in the non-abundant species as
predicted by the hybrid approach and by the conventional chemical master
equation. Furthermore we show that surprisingly, irrespective of any separation
in the mean molecule numbers of various species, the conventional and hybrid

those who study or teach at the university level and school levels. The support
of electronic learning (elearning) is essential to making mobile learning
(m-learning) successful. This paper presents a study that applies mlearning to
a course at Qassim University, where 100 students attended during the academic
year 2014, including summer courses. The study aims to demonstrate that
m-learning provides students with the ability to engage in reflective thinking,
to share information among peers and to facilitate the construction of social
knowledge. 90 student questionnaires were filled correctly, remaining 10 had
various anomalies and thus were not considered. The study also aims to
demonstrate that learning provides methods for education strategies to be
easily and rapidly applied. Such strategies include team work, time management,
etc. In order to judge the feasibility of applying m-learning widely, a
questionnaire was developed. The results indicate that m-learning helps make
the process of education more convenient than in the past. A major disadvantage
of applying m-learning is inadequate wireless network bandwidth.

the renormalized phonons instead of phonons are responsible for heat transport
in nonlinear lattices. In this work, we directly study the temperature and
frequency dependent Mean Free Path (MFP) of renormalized phonons with the newly
developed numerical tuning fork method. The typical 1D nonlinear lattices such
as Fermi-Pasta-Ulam $\beta$ (FPU-$\beta$) lattice and $\phi^4$ lattice are
investigated in details. It is found that the MFPs are inversely proportional
to the frequencies of renormalized phonons rather than the square of phonon
frequencies predicted by existing phonon scattering theory.

  2015",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although extensively investigated, the capacity of the two-hop half-duplex
(HD) relay channel is not fully understood. In particular, a capacity
expression which can be evaluated straightforwardly is not available and an
explicit coding scheme which achieves the capacity is not known either. In this
paper, we derive a new expression for the capacity of the two-hop HD relay
channel based on a simplified converse. Compared to previous results, this
capacity expression can be easily evaluated. Moreover, we propose an explicit
coding scheme which achieves the capacity. To achieve the capacity, the relay
does not only send information to the destination by transmitting
information-carrying symbols but also with the zero symbols resulting from the
relay's silence during reception. As examples, we compute the capacities of the
two-hop HD relay channel for the cases when the source-relay and
relay-destination links are both binary-symmetric channels (BSCs) and additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, respectively, and numerically compare the
capacities with the rates achieved by conventional relaying where the relay
receives and transmits in a codeword-by-codeword fashion and switches between
reception and transmission in a strictly alternating manner. Our numerical
results show that the capacities of the two-hop HD relay channel for BSC and
AWGN links are significantly larger than the rates achieved with conventional
relaying.

  Incubation Periods","References added",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study explosiveness of age-dependent branching processes describing the
early stages of an epidemic-spread: both forward- and backward process are
analysed. For the classical age-dependent branching process $(h,G)$, where the
offspring has probability generating function $h$ and all individuals have
life-lengths independently picked from a distribution $G$, we focus on the
setting $h = h_{\alpha}^L$, with $L$ a function varying slowly at infinity and
$\alpha \in (0,1)$. Here, $h^L_{\alpha}(s) = 1 - (1-s)^{\alpha}
L(\frac{1}{1-s}),$ as $s \to 1$. For a fixed $G$, the process
$(h^L_{\alpha},G)$ explodes either for all $\alpha \in (0,1)$ or for no $\alpha
\in (0,1)$, regardless of $L$. Next, we add contagious periods to all
individuals and let their offspring survive only if their life-length is
smaller than the contagious period of their mother: a forward process. An
explosive process $(h^L_{\alpha},G)$, as above, stays explosive when adding a
non-zero contagious period. We extend this setting to backward processes with
contagious periods. Further, we consider processes with incubation periods
during which an individual has already contracted the disease but is not able
yet to infect her acquaintances. We let these incubation periods follow a
distribution $I$. In the forward process $(h^L_{\alpha},G,I)_{f}$, every
individual possesses an incubation period and only her offspring with life-time
larger than this period survives. In the backward process
$(h^L_{\alpha},G,I)_{b}$, individuals survive only if their life-time exceeds
their own incubation period. These two processes are the content of the third
main result that we establish: under a mild condition on $G$ and $I$,
explosiveness of both $(h,G)$ and $(h,I)$ is necessary and sufficient for
processes $(h^L_{\alpha},G,I)_{f}$ and $(h^L_{\alpha},G,I)_{b}$ to explode.

  development of senile cortical cataract","8 pages, figures",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In lens cataract, the clouding change in lens leads to a decline of
transparency of part of the lens. There are three types of senile cataract:
cortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and posterior/anterior sub-capsular
cataract. The most common senile cataract is cortical cataract. For
understanding cortical cataract, the pathology and the causing factors in
cortical cataract are analyzed. The clouding change in senile cortical cataract
begins from the edge of the lens and develops progressively to lens centre. The
pathology of clouding change in cortical cataract is characterized by
disruption of some lens fibers, swelling of some other fibers, and deposition
of water between fibers. Based on the property of a lens fiber, we propose here
a hypothesis on the mechanism of development of senile cortical cataract. I.
Cortical cataract is triggered by disruption of a cortical lens fiber as a
result of injury. The disrupted fiber will release water and crystallin
proteins. II. Neighbor fibers can absorb this water due to high intracellular
osmotic pressure (IOP) and become swollen. Swelling makes a fiber be stiff and
have increased risk to disrupt when it is curved during the accommodation of
the lens. These fibers will release water again when they disrupt, and the
water will make more local fibers swelling. In this way, the local fibers
become swollen and then disrupt successively. III. The successive swellings and
disruptions of local fibers result in enlargement of a clouding change in lens.
Since the fibers on the outer part of lens cortex have higher risk to be
injured than that in the inner part, a clouding change starts from the edge of
the lens. In conclusion, the progressive development of senile cortical
cataract is a result of successive swellings and disruptions of local lens
fibers, and this is driven by the high IOP in a lens fiber.

detected an extremely variable emission during both bright and low luminosity
phases, with dramatic variations of the hardness ratio on time scales of
~seconds. The analysis of the IBIS and SPI data reveals the presence of hard
spectra in the brightest phases, compatible with thermal Comptonization with
temperature kTe ~ 40 keV. The seed photons temperature is best fit by kT0 ~ 7
keV, that is too high to be compatible with blackbody emission from the disk.
This result is consistent with the seed photons being provided by a different
source, that we hypothesize to be a synchrotron driven component in the jet.
During the brightest phase of flares, the hardness shows a complex pattern of
correlation with flux, with a maximum energy released in the range 40-100 keV.
The hard X-ray variability for E > 50 keV is correlated with flux variations in
the softer band, showing that the overall source variability cannot originate
entirely from absorption, but at least part of it is due to the central
accreting source.

radiative and convective zones, and there are potentially important effects
arising from the interaction of magnetic fields at the boundaries between them.
Related to this, we discuss whether the Sun could harbour a magnetic field in
its core. Recent developments regarding the various convective and radiative

rotation rather than convection. Finally we turn to neutron stars with a

suggests ways of modifying existing i-vector extractors to make them more

system is a heavily doped quantum well, exhibiting a collective bright
electronic excitation in the mid-infrared. The spontaneous emission rate of
this collective mode strongly depends on the emission direction and, uncommonly

Consequently the incandescence spectrum undergoes strong modifications when the

consequences on the chemical composition of regions where stars are forming.
Recent observations show that many species formed onto dust are populating the
gas phase, especially in cold environments where UV and CR induced photons do
not account for such processes. Aims. The aim of this paper is to understand
and quantify the process that releases solid species into the gas phase, the
so-called chemical desorption process, so that an explicit formula can be
derived that can be included into astrochemical models. Methods. We present a
collection of experimental results of more than 10 reactive systems. For each
reaction, different substrates such as oxidized graphite and compact amorphous
water ice are used. We derive a formula to reproduce the efficiencies of the
chemical desorption process, which considers the equipartition of the energy of
newly formed products, followed by classical bounce on the surface. In part II
we extend these results to astrophysical conditions. Results. The equipartition
of energy describes correctly the chemical desorption process on bare surfaces.
On icy surfaces, the chemical desorption process is much less efficient and a
better description of the interaction with the surface is still needed.
Conclusions. We show that the mechanism that directly transforms solid species
to gas phase species is efficient for many reactions.

law of thermodynamics by imagining a tiny creature who could sort the molecules

The demon has been discussed largely using thought experiments, but it has
recently become possible to exert control over nanoscale systems, just as
Maxwell imagined, and the status of the second law has become a more practical
matter, raising the issue of how measurements manage our ignorance in a way
that can be exploited. The framework of stochastic thermodynamics extends
macroscopic concepts such as heat, work, entropy and irreversibility to small
systems and allows us explore the matter. Some arguments against a successful
demon imply a second law that can be suspended indefinitely until we dissipate
energy in order to remove the records of his operations. In contrast, under
stochastic thermodynamics the demon fails because on average more work is
performed upfront in making a measurement than is to be extracted by exploiting
the outcome. This requires us to exclude systems and a demon that evolve under
what might be termed self-sorting dynamics, and we reflect on the constraints
on control that this implies while still working within a thermodynamic
framework.

analysis of large alignments of homologs of the protein of interest. Our method

accelerated by the effect of the radiation pressure, have been presented. We
conducted an extensive observational campaign, from radio to optical band, to
collect information about their nature and test the models present in the
literature, the main dichotomy being between a young scenario and an
orientation one. We found a variety of possible orientations, morphologies, and
radio ages, not converging to a particular explanation for the BAL phenomenon.
From our latest observations in the m- and mm-band, we obtained an indication
of a lower dust abundance with respect to normal quasars, thus suggesting a
possible feedback process on the host galaxy. Also, in the low-frequency regime
we confirmed the presence of CSS components, sometime in conjunction with a GPS
one already detected at higher frequencies. Following this, about 70% of our
sample turns out to be in a GPS or CSS+GPS phase. We conclude that fast
outflows, responsible for the BAL features, can be more easily present among
objects going through a restarting or just-started radio phase, where radiation
pressure can substantially contribute to their acceleration.

from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. The approach to solving reachability problems
is based on the characterization of reachability paths between points which is
followed by the translation of numerical problems on matrices into

give a geometric interpretation of reachability paths and extend the
decidability results to matrix products represented by arbitrary labelled
directed graphs. Finally, we will use this technique to prove that a special

investigate how the estimation error behaves with a reduction in the number of

present extensive simulation results showing that the error is robust with
respect to the choice of states of a given rank, the random selection of

only a negligible increase in error. We present an argument to explain these

In the more general setup of random basis measurements we use this argument to
show that for certain rank $r$ states it suffices to measure in $O(r\log d)$
bases to achieve the average Fisher information over all bases. We present
numerical evidence for states upto 8 atoms, supporting a conjecture on a lower

on the Zero-tilting Moment Point (ZMP). The key to our development is the
generalization of ZMP support areas to take into account (a) frictional
constraints and (b) multiple non-coplanar contacts. We introduce and
investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas. First, we characterize and provide
a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact
forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the full
support area. Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots using the Linear
Pendulum Mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM
induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal floors.
We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call pendular support
area. We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the pendular support area is
a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these
developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible
multi-contact motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging
multi-contact scenarios.

sedimentation reinforces the formation of clusters of higher particle density.
We provide a quantitative analysis of cluster formation. We derive a nonlinear
moment closure model, which consists of evolution equations for the density and
second order moments and that uses the structure of spherical harmonics to
suggest a closure strategy. For a rectilinear flow we employ the moment closure
together with a quasi-dynamic approximation to derive an effective equation,

diffusion coupled to a Poisson equation, and belongs to the class of the
so-called flux-limited Keller-Segel models. For shear flows, we provide an
argument for the validity of the effective equation and perform numerical
comparisons that indicate good agreement between the original system and the

\emph{dynamic sketching}. In this model, the underlying data is partitioned
into a large \emph{static} part and a small \emph{dynamic} part and the goal is
to compute a summary of the static part (i.e, a \emph{sketch}) such that given
any \emph{update} for the dynamic part, one can combine it with the sketch to
compute a given function. We say that a sketch is \emph{compact} if its size is
bounded by a polynomial function of the length of the dynamic data,
(essentially) independent of the size of the static part.
  A graph optimization problem $P$ in this model is defined as follows. The
input is a graph $G(V,E)$ and a set $T \subseteq V$ of $k$ terminals; the edges
between the terminals are the dynamic part and the other edges in $G$ are the
static part. The goal is to summarize the graph $G$ into a compact sketch (of
size poly$(k)$) such that given any set $Q$ of edges between the terminals, one
can answer the problem $P$ for the graph obtained by inserting all edges in $Q$
to $G$, using only the sketch.
  We study the fundamental problem of computing a maximum matching and prove
tight bounds on the sketch size. In particular, we show that there exists a
(compact) dynamic sketch of size $O(k^2)$ for the matching problem and any such
sketch has to be of size $\Omega(k^2)$. Our sketch for matchings can be further
used to derive compact dynamic sketches for other fundamental graph problems
involving cuts and connectivities. Interestingly, our sketch for matchings can
also be used to give an elementary construction of a \emph{cut-preserving
vertex sparsifier} with space $O(kC^2)$ for $k$-terminal graphs; here $C$ is
the total capacity of the edges incident on the terminals. Additionally, we
give an improved lower bound (in terms of $C$) of $\Omega(C/\log{C})$ on size

temperature has potential to revolutionize nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and imaging. The prevalent methods for achieving DNP in solutions
are typically most effective in the regime of small interaction correlation
times between the electron and nuclear spins, limiting the size of accessible
molecules. To solve this limitation, we design a mechanism for DNP in the
liquid phase that is applicable for large interaction correlation times.
Importantly, while this mechanism makes use of a resonance condition similar to
solid-state DNP, the polarization transfer is robust to a relatively large
detuning from the resonance due to molecular motion. We combine this scheme
with optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds to
design a setup that employs optical pumping and is therefore not limited by
room temperature electron thermal polarisation. We illustrate numerically the
effectiveness of the model in a flow cell containing nanodiamonds immobilized

momentum distribution is broadly consistent with that theoretically predicted
for their dark matter halos, in terms of mean spin parameter <$\lambda$> ~
0.037 and its dispersion ($\sigma_{log(\lambda)}$~0.2). Spin parameters
correlate with the disk radial scale, and with their stellar surface density,
but do not depend significantly on halo mass, stellar mass, or redshift. Our
data thus support the long-standing assumption that on average, even at high
redshifts, the specific angular momentum of disk galaxies reflects that of
their dark matter halos (j_d = j_DM). The lack of correlation between $\lambda$
x (j_d/j_DM) and the nuclear stellar density $\Sigma_{*}$(1kpc) favors a
scenario where disk-internal angular momentum redistribution leads to
""compaction"" inside massive high-redshift disks. For our sample, the inferred
average stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio is ~2%, consistent with abundance
matching results. Including the molecular gas, the total baryonic disk-to-dark

three main topics -- validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), pulse
compression, and collisions of counter-propagating pulses. The cases of long

that the RWA does not give a correct description of chirped pulse interaction

stronger than of the chirped one, while the opposite is true for long pulses.
We demonstrate that the influence of chirp on the collisions of the long pulses
allows to control the state of the transmitted radiation: the transmission of
the chirp-free pulse can be dramatically changed under collision with the
chirped counter-propagating one, in sharp contrast to the case when both pulses
are chirped. On the other hand, the collisions of the chirped single-cycle
pulses can be used for precise control of medium excitation in a narrow spatial

locking, as seen in {\it Chlamydomonas}, and metachronal wave formation in the
respiratory cilia of higher organisms. Since the observations by Gray and
Rothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, it has been a
working hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between
beating filaments. Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of
flagella isolated from the multicellular alga {\it Volvox} has shown that
hydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony. However, the
situation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella. We
show that flagella of {\it Chlamydomonas} mutants deficient in filamentary
connections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization
from the wild type. We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella
and conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional
flagellar coupling. In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16
flagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the
flagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar
actuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling
and hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of
flagellar coordination in unicellular algae.

orders of magnitude as compared with the standard full model based on

connection between different layers of the solar atmosphere. However, it is not
clear whether these oscillations are externally driven or generated in-situ. We
address this question by using observations of propagating slow
magneto-acoustic waves along a coronal fan loop system. In addition to the
generally observed decreases in oscillation amplitudes with distance, the
observed wave amplitudes are also found to be modulated with time, with similar
variations observed throughout the propagation path of the wavetrain. Employing
multi-wavelength and multi-instrument data we study the amplitude variations
with time as the waves propagate through different layers of the solar
atmosphere. By comparing the amplitude-modulation period in different layers,
we find that slow magneto-acoustic waves observed in sunspots are externally
driven by photospheric p-modes, which propagate upwards into the corona before
becoming dissipated.

the consequence of gravitational interaction with additional bodies in the
system. However, TTVs can also be caused by deformations of the system transits
by starspots, which might thus pose a serious complication in their
interpretation. We therefore simulate transit light curves deformed by
spot-crossing events for different properties of the stellar surface and the
planet, such as starspot position, limb darkening, planetary period, and impact
parameter. Mid-transit times determined from these simulations can be
significantly shifted with respect to the input values; these shifts cannot be
larger than ~1% of the transit duration and depend most strongly on the
longitudinal position of the spot during the transit and the transit duration.
Consequently, TTVs with amplitudes larger than the above limit are very
unlikely to be caused by starspots. We also investigate whether TTVs from
sequences of consecutive transits with spot-crossing anomalies can be
misinterpreted as the result of an additional body in the system. We use the
Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for periods in TTVs and conclude
that low amplitude TTVs with statistically significant periods around active
stars are the most problematic cases. In those cases where the photometric
precision is high enough to inspect the transit shapes for deformations, it
should be possible to identify TTVs caused by starspots, however, especially
for cases with low transit signal to noise light curves (TSNR $\lesssim$ 15) it
becomes quite difficult to reliably decide whether these periods come from
starspots, physical companions in the system or if they are random noise
artifacts.

probe such crunching cosmologies with spacelike radial geodesics that compute
spatially antipodal correlators of large dimension boundary operators. At late
times, the geodesics lie on the FRW slice of maximal expansion behind the
horizon. The late time two-point functions factorise, and when transformed to

determined by the maximal value of the scale factor a_{max} . Radial geodesics
connecting antipodal points necessarily have de Sitter energy E \leq a_{max},
while geodesics with E > a_{max} terminate at the crunch, the two categories of
geodesics being separated by the maximal expansion slice. The spacelike crunch
singularity is curved ""outward"" in the Penrose diagram for the deformed AdS

directly probe the crunch. Beyond the geodesic limit, we point out that the

Gross regime (GR) and the fixed momentum transfer or Regge regime (RR). We
calculated in details high energy string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary
mass levels for both regimes. We discovered infinite linear relations among
fixed angle string amplitudes conjectured by Gross in 1988 from decoupling of
high energy zero-norm states (ZNS), and infinite recurrence relations among
Regge string amplitudes from Kummer function U and Appell function F_1.
However, the linear relations we obtained in the GR corrected [27-32] the
saddle point calculations of Gross, Gross and Mende and Gross and Manes [1-5].
Our results were consistent with the decoupling of high energy ZNS or unitarity
of the theory while those of them were not. In addition, for the case of high
energy closed string scatterings, our results [36] differ from theirs by an
oscillating prefactor which was crucial to recover the KLT relation valid for
all energies. In the GR/RR regime, all high energy string amplitudes can be
solved by these linear/recurrence relations so that all GR/RR string amplitudes
can be expressed in terms of one single GR/RR string amplitude. In addition, we
found an interesting link between string amplitudes of the two regimes, and
discovered that at each mass level the ratios among fixed angle amplitudes can
be extracted from Regge string scattering amplitudes. This result enables us to
argue that the known SL(5,C) dynamical symmetry of the Appell function F_1 is
crucial to probe high energy spacetime symmetry of string theory.

  Problem Determination","12 pages",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Database query performance problem determination is often performed by
analyzing query execution plans (QEPs) in addition to other performance data.
As the query workloads that organizations run, have become larger and more
complex, analyzing QEPs manually even by experts has become a very time
consuming. Most performance diagnostic tools help with identifying problematic
queries and most query tuning tools address a limited number of known problems
and recommendations. We present the OptImatch system that offers a way to (a)
look for varied user defined problem patterns in QEPs and (b) automatically get
recommendations from an expert provided and user customizable knowledge base.
Existing approaches do not provide the ability to perform workload analysis
with flexible user defined patterns, as they lack the ability to impose a
proper structure on QEPs. We introduce a novel semantic web system that allows
a relatively naive user to search for arbitrary patterns and to get
recommendations stored in a knowledge base either by experts or added by the
user tailored to the environment in which they operate. Our methodology
includes transforming a QEP into an RDF graph and transforming a GUI based
user-defined pattern into a SPARQL query through handlers. The SPARQL query is
matched against the abstracted RDF graph, and any matched portion of the
abstracted RDF graph is relayed back to the user. With the knowledge base, the
OptImatch system automatically scans and matches interesting stored patterns in
a statistical way as appropriate and returns the corresponding recommendations.
Although the knowledge base patterns and solution recommendations are not in
the context of the user supplied QEPs, the context is adapted automatically
through the handler tagging interface.

Even more serious discrepancies can arise for anisotropic materials, e.g.,
organic crystals, where off-diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor can
significantly contribute to the spectral features. Here, we present
LayerOptics, a versatile and user-friendly implementation, based on the
solution of the Maxwell's equations for anisotropic materials, to compute
optical coefficients in anisotropic layered materials. We apply this tool for
post-processing full dielectric tensors of molecular materials, including
excitonic effects, as computed from many-body perturbation theory using the

obtain dielectric tensors, with the solution of the Maxwell's equations to
compute optical coefficients accounting for optical anisotropy of layered

developed as an admissibility measure of wind generation. Then its linear

  Generation: An Adjustable Uncertainty Set Approach","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1510.03308",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses two vital issues which are barely discussed in the
literature on robust unit commitment (RUC): 1) how much the potential
operational loss could be if the realization of uncertainty is beyond the
prescribed uncertainty set; 2) how large the prescribed uncertainty set should
be when it is used for RUC decision making. In this regard, a robust
risk-constrained unit commitment (RRUC) formulation is proposed to cope with
large-scale volatile and uncertain wind generation. Differing from existing RUC
formulations, the wind generation uncertainty set in RRUC is adjustable via
choosing diverse levels of operational risk. By optimizing the uncertainty set,
RRUC can allocate operational flexibility of power systems over spatial and
temporal domains optimally, reducing operational cost in a risk-constrained
manner. Moreover, since impact of wind generation realization out of the
prescribed uncertainty set on operational risk is taken into account, RRUC
outperforms RUC in the case of rare events. Three algorithms based on column
and constraint generation (C&CG) are derived to solve the RRUC. As the proposed
algorithms are quite general, they can also apply to other RUC models to

manifestly holds in Yang's quantized space-time as the result of kinematical
reduction of spatial degrees of freedom caused by its own nature of
noncommutative geometry and plays an important role in our approach without any
recourse to the familiar hypothesis, so-called Holographic Principle. In the

that is in good quantitative agreement with the thermodynamics of
$(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD around the crossover transition for baryon chemical
potentials up to 400 MeV, which may be reached in the beam energy scan (BES) at
RHIC. We find that increasing the temperature $T$ and the baryon chemical

electric charge susceptibility, the DC and AC electric conductivities and the
electric charge diffusion as functions of $T$ and $\mu_B$. We find that
electric diffusive transport is suppressed as one increases $\mu_B$. At zero
baryon density, we compare our results for the DC electric conductivity and the
electric charge diffusion with the latest lattice data available for these

Therefore, our holographic results may be used to constraint the magnitude of

modes at surface of bulk SrTiO3. A two-dimensional system of charges at the
FeSe/SrTiO3 interface includes both the itinerant and immobile electrons. The
latter significantly change the interface characteristics, increasing screening
at the substrate surface and reducing thereby the strength of the electron-LO
phonon interactions. In that follows the dielectric constant serves as a free
parameter and is found from the ARPES data for the replicas. The
two-dimensional Coulomb screening is accounted for in the random phase
approximation. It is shown that the model is applicable within the whole range
of the parameters typical for current experiments. The estimates allow
concluding that the LO-phonon mediated pairing alone cannot account for the
temperatures of the superconducting transition Tc in the single-layer
FeSe/SrTiO3 reported in these experiments. This does not exclude that the
LO-phonons mechanism can become more significant in the differently and better
prepared single layer FeSe films. Available experiments are briefly discussed.
Thus far no data exist on the dependence of Tc on the concentration of

$r(t)$ - of the absorbing boundary $m(t)$ such that $\omega(x):=\lim_t h(x+m(t)

non-linear FKPP equation, we recover the celebrated $-(3/2)\log t$ correction
for initial conditions decaying faster than $x^\nu e^{-x}$ for some $\nu<-2$.
  Furthermore, when we are in this regime, the main result of the present work
is the identification (to first order) of the $r(t)$ term which ensures the
fastest convergence to $\omega(x)$. When $h_0(x)$ decays faster than $x^\nu
e^{-x}$ for some $\nu<-3$, we show that $r(t)$ must be chosen to be
$-3\sqrt{\pi/t}$ which is precisely the term predicted heuristically by
Ebert-van Saarloos in the non-linear case. When the initial condition decays as
$x^\nu e^{-x}$ for some $\nu \in [-3,-2)$, we show that even though we are
still in the regime where Bramson's correction is $-(3/2)\log t$, the Ebert-van
Saarloos correction has to be modified.

consider a two-level parameter-reduction for this function to simplify the
solution of the parquet equations. The resulting functions, which depend on
fewer arguments, are coined ""kernel functions"". With the use of the ""kernel
functions"", the open boundary of various vertex functions in the
Matsubara-frequency space can be faithfully satisfied. We justify our
implementation by accurately reproducing the dynamical mean-field theory
results from momentum-independent parquet calculations. The high-frequency
asymptotics of the single-particle self-energy and the two-particle vertex are
correctly reproduced, which turns out to be essential for the self-consistent
determination of the parquet solutions. The current implementation is also
feasible for the dynamical vertex approximation.

significant information in critical situations; examples abound in domains such
as finance, IT, security, medical, and energy. Yet detecting anomalies in
streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in
real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions.
There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time
anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which
attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source
tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The
perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no
false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of
domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these
characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for
streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled,
real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and
analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for
NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research
community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies

important for a number of problems in cosmology and astrophysics. All current
models addressing this question are one-dimensional and do not account for the
fact that magnetic fields can effectively channel ions and electrons, leading
to anisotropic transport of momentum, heat, and particle diffusion in the
weakly collisional intracluster medium (ICM). This anisotropy can lead to a
wide variety of instabilities, which could be relevant for understanding the
dynamics of heterogeneous media. In this paper, we consider the radial
temperature and composition profiles as obtained from a state-of-the-art Helium
sedimentation model and analyze its stability properties. We find that the
associated radial profiles are unstable, to different kinds of instabilities
depending on the magnetic field orientation, at all radii. The fastest growing
modes are usually related to generalizations of the Magnetothermal Instability
(MTI) and the Heat-flux-driven Buoyancy Instability (HBI) which operate in
heterogeneous media. We find that the effect of sedimentation is to increase
(decrease) the predicted growth rates in the inner (outer) cluster region. The
unstable modes grow fast compared to the sedimentation timescale. This suggests
that the composition gradients as inferred from sedimentation models, which do
not fully account for the anisotropic character of the weakly collisional
environment, might not be very robust. Our results emphasize the subtleties
involved in understanding the gas dynamics of the ICM and argue for the need of
a comprehensive approach to address the issue of Helium sedimentation beyond
current models.

  applications","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first step towards high critical currents in Bi-2212 wires was the
comprehension that the supercurrent is blocked over long lengths by
filament-diameter bubbles grown during the melt stage, which cause expansion of
the wire diameter and dedensification of the superconducting filaments. Whereas
the previous successful approach to reduce the problem of voids related to
bubbles was based on the application of a high overpressure during the heat
treatment, we fabricated Bi-2212 wires by applying a new concept of suitably
alternating groove-rolling and drawing techniques with the aim of densifying
the phase already during the working procedure prior to the heat treatment. We
here for the first time were able to reach in wires reacted with closed ends -
i.e. with gas trapped in the wire as it happens in long-length wires - the very
same values of critical current shown in short wires reacted with open ends.
This is the irrefutable evidence that, only by acting on the deformation
technique, we were able to raise the critical current by properly densifying
the superconducting powder inside the filaments already before the melt stage.
Whole-conductor current densities in our long length simulation wires already
reach 400 A/mm2 at 4.2 K and 5 T, which can be still easily increased through
architecture optimization. The actual breakthrough is that the densification is
optimized without further complex treatments through a technique which can be
straightforwardly applied to long-lengths wires.

the Kepler K2 mission Campaign 1 data. This star pulsates primarily in the
fundamental and first-overtone radial modes, and, in addition, a third
nonradial mode. The ratio of the period of the nonradial mode to that of the
first-overtone radial mode, 0.616285, is remarkably similar to that seen in 11
other triple-mode RR Lyr stars, and in 260 RRc stars observed in the Galactic
Bulge. This systematic character promises new constraints on RR Lyr star
models. We detected subharmonics of the nonradial mode frequency, which are a
signature of period doubling of this oscillation; we note that this phenomenon
is ubiquitous in RRc and RRd stars observed from space, and from ground with
sufficient precision. The nonradial mode and subharmonic frequencies are not
constant in frequency or in amplitude. The amplitude spectrum of EPIC 201585823
is dominated by many combination frequencies among the three interacting
pulsation mode frequencies. Inspection of the phase relationships of the
combination frequencies in a phasor plot explains the `upward' shape of the
light curve. We also found that raw data with custom masks encompassing all
pixels with significant signal for the star, but without correction for
pointing changes, is best for frequency analysis of this star, and, by
implication, other RR Lyr stars observed by the K2 mission. We compare several

characteristic polynomial computed from the normalized Laplacian matrix, we
show how the polynomial is linked to the Boltzmann partition function of a
network. This allows us to compute a number of thermodynamic quantities for the
network, including the average energy and entropy. Assuming that the system
does not change volume, we can also compute the temperature, defined as the
rate of change of entropy with energy. All three thermodynamic variables can be
approximated using low-order Taylor series that can be computed using the
traces of powers of the Laplacian matrix, avoiding explicit computation of the
normalized Laplacian spectrum. These polynomial approximations allow a smoothed
representation of the evolution of networks to be constructed in the
thermodynamic space spanned by entropy, energy, and temperature. We show how
these thermodynamic variables can be computed in terms of simple network
characteristics, e.g., the total number of nodes and node degree statistics for
nodes connected by edges. We apply the resulting thermodynamic characterization
to real-world time-varying networks representing complex systems in the
financial and biological domains. The study demonstrates that the method
provides an efficient tool for detecting abrupt changes and characterizing
different stages in network evolution.
