""solar activity'', IAU's Commission 10 was formally discontinued in 2015, to be
succeeded by C.E2 with the same area of responsibility. On this occasion, we
look back at the growth of the scientific disciplines involved around the world
over almost a full century. Solar activity and fields of research looking into
the related physics of the heliosphere continue to be vibrant and growing, with
currently over 2,000 refereed publications appearing per year from over 4,000
unique authors, publishing in dozens of distinct journals and meeting in dozens
of workshops and conferences each year. The size of the rapidly growing
community and of the observational and computational data volumes, along with
the multitude of connections into other branches of astrophysics, pose
significant challenges; aspects of these challenges are beginning to be
addressed through, among others, the development of new systems of literature
reviews, machine-searchable archives for data and publications, and virtual
observatories. As customary in these reports, we highlight some of the research
topics that have seen particular interest over the most recent triennium,
specifically active-region magnetic fields, coronal thermal structure, coronal
seismology, flares and eruptions, and the variability of solar activity on long
time scales. We close with a collection of developments, discoveries, and
surprises that illustrate the range and dynamics of the discipline.

Besides the celebrated example, Dirac and Weyl points which possess gapless

protected gapless spectrum can also occur along a ring, named Dirac and Weyl
nodal rings. Ultra-cold atomic gases provide an ideal platform for exploring
new topological materials with designed symmetries. However, whether Dirac and
Weyl rings can exist in the single-particle spectrum of cold atoms remains
elusive. Here we propose a realistic model for realizing Dirac and Weyl rings
in the single-particle band dispersion of a cold atom optical lattice. Our
scheme is based on previously experimentally already implemented Raman coupling
setup for realizing spin-orbit coupling. Without the Zeeman field, the model
preserves both pseudo-time-reversal and inversion symmetries, allowing Dirac
rings. The Dirac rings split into Weyl rings with a Zeeman field that breaks
the pseudo-time-reversal symmetry. We examine the superfluidity of attractive
Fermi gases in this model and also find Dirac and Weyl rings in the
quasiparticle spectrum.

Simultaneoulsy, the two atomic sites in the unit cell of these crystals form
inversion partners which gives rise to relativistic non-equilibrium spin
phenomena highly relevant for magnetic memories and other spintronic devices.
When the inversion-partner sites are occupied by the same atomic species,
electrical current can generate local spin polarization with the same magnitude
and opposite sign on the two inversion-partner sites. In CuMnAs, which shares
this specific crystal symmetry of the Si lattice, the effect led to the
demonstration of electrical switching in an antiferromagnetic memory at room
temperature. When the inversion-partner sites are occupied by different atoms,
a non-zero global spin-polarization is generated by the applied current which
can switch a ferromagnet, as reported at low temperatures in the diluted
magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. Here we demonstrate the effect of the global
current-induced spin polarization in a counterpart crystal-symmetry material
NiMnSb which is a member of the broad family of magnetic Heusler compounds. It
is an ordered high-temperature ferromagnetic metal whose other favorable
characteristics include high spin-polarization and low damping of magnetization
dynamics. Our experiments are performed on strained single-crystal epilayers of
NiMnSb grown on InGaAs. By performing all-electrical ferromagnetic resonance
measurements in microbars patterned along different crystal axes we detect
room-temperature spin-orbit torques generated by effective fields of the

medium (IGM) promises to shed light on both the nature of the first objects and
the cosmic history of baryons. Towards this goal, quasar absorption lines play
a unique role by probing the properties of diffuse gas on galactic and
intergalactic scales. In this review we examine the multiple ways in which
absorption lines trace the connection between galaxies and the IGM near the
reionization epoch. We first describe how the Ly$\alpha$ forest is used to
determine the intensity of the ionizing ultraviolet background and the global
ionizing emissivity budget. Critically, these measurements reflect the escaping
ionizing radiation from all galaxies, including those too faint to detect
directly. We then discuss insights from metal absorption lines into
reionization-era galaxies and their surroundings. Current observations suggest
a buildup of metals in the circumgalactic environments of galaxies over $z \sim
6$ to 5, although changes in ionization will also affect the evolution of metal
line properties. A substantial fraction of metal absorbers at these redshifts
may trace relatively low-mass galaxies. Finally, we review constraints from the
Ly$\alpha$ forest and quasar near zones on the timing of reionization. Along
with other probes of the high-redshift Universe, absorption line data are
consistent with a relatively late end to reionization ($5.5 \lesssim z \lesssim
7$); however the constraints are still fairly weak. Significant progress is
expected to come through improved analysis techniques, increases in the number
of known high-redshift quasars from optical and infrared sky surveys, large
gains in sensitivity from next-generation observing facilities, and synergies
with other probes of the reionization era.

exact Bethe-ansatz method and variational perturbation theory within the
degenerate ground state subspace of the system in the infinitely repulsive
limit. Based on the exact solution of the one-dimensional Bose-Fermi gas with
equal boson-boson and boson-fermion interaction strengths, we demonstrate that
the ground state energy is degenerate for different Bose-Fermi configurations
and the degeneracy is lifted when the interaction deviates the infinitely
interacting limit. We then show that the ground properties in the strongly
interacting regime can be well characterized by using the variational
perturbation method within the degenerate ground state subspace, which can be
applied to deal with more general cases with anisotropic interactions and in
external traps. Our results indicate that the total ground-state density
profile in the strongly repulsive regime behaves like the polarized
noninteracting fermions, whereas the density distributions of bosons and
fermions display different properties for different Bose-Fermi configurations
and are sensitive to the anisotropy of interactions.

fundamental studies of quantum electrodynamics and for the development of

atom interacting with a single photon at all regimes of coupling strength. We
report the spectroscopic observation of a resonant transition that breaks a
selection rule in the quantum Rabi model, implemented using an $LC$ resonator
and an artificial atom, a superconducting qubit. The eigenstates of the system
consist of a superposition of bare qubit-resonator states with a relative sign.
When the qubit-resonator coupling strength is negligible compared to their own
frequencies, the matrix element between excited eigenstates of different sign
is very small in presence of a resonator drive, establishing a sign-preserving
selection rule. Here, our qubit-resonator system operates in the ultrastrong
coupling regime, where the coupling strength is 10\% of the resonator
frequency, allowing sign-changing transitions to be activated and, therefore,
detected. This work shows that sign-changing transitions are an unambiguous,
distinctive signature of systems operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime
of the quantum Rabi model. These results pave the way to further studies of
sign-preserving selection rules in multiqubit and multiphoton models.

communication. The channel diagonalization is applied by using zero-forcing
beam-forming. After channel diagonalization, the channel is decomposed into
parallel sub-channels. Cyclic communication is then applied, where signal-space
alignment for network-coding is used over each sub-channel. The proposed
strategy achieves the optimal DoF region of the channel if $N\leq M$. To prove
this, a new degrees-of-freedom outer bound is derived. As a by-product, we

approach and introduce the pion transverse momentum distribution amplitude
(TMDA) which plays, in a covariant Lagrangian formulation, a role similar to
that of the pion wave function in the 3-dimensional Hamiltonian light-front
approach. We propose simple factorized models for soft TMDAs, and use them to
describe existing data on the pion transition form factor, thus fixing the
scale determining the size of the transverse-momentum effects. Finally, we
apply the VDA approach to the one-gluon exchange contribution for the pion
electromagnetic form factor. We observe a very late $Q^2 \gtrsim 20$ GeV$^2$
onset of transition to the asymptotic pQCD predictions and show that in the
$Q^2 \lesssim 10$ GeV$^2$ region there is essentially no sensitivity to the
shape of the pion distribution amplitude. Furthermore, the magnitude of the

magnitude below the Jefferson Lab data, thus leaving the Feynman mechanism as

we build and verify four distinct DA methods, and then, we perform a twin model

for the use of less observations in predicting flow reversals. We also show
that a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) of the temperature and velocity fields

approximation. We discuss the existence of two scaling limits when the cutoff
is taken to infinity. One scaling limit reproduces the results obtained by the
hypercubic regularisation of the Nambu-Goto string as well as by the use of the
dynamical triangulation regularisation of the Polyakov string. The other
scaling limit reproduces the results obtained by canonical quantisation of the
Nambu-Goto string.

starts its journey in the usual space of gravity, can reach the other side of
the singularity in a finite amount of proper time. As usual, an observer

unit area of the walls. If the filaments are arranged regular-tetrahedrally,
filament properties obey simple laws, reminiscent of angular-momentum
conservation. The model may be most useful in understanding spin correlations

intrinsic alignments between galaxies, essential to understand for accurate

necessarily requires complexification of the action and measure, and
consideration of complex saddle solutions. We demonstrate that complex saddle
points have a natural interpretation in terms of the Picard-Lefschetz theory.
Motivated in part by the semi-classical expansion of QCD with adjoint matter on
${\mathbb R}^3\times S^1$, we study quantum-mechanical systems with bosonic and
fermionic (Grassmann) degrees of freedom with harmonic degenerate minima, as
well as (related) purely bosonic systems with harmonic non-degenerate minima.
We find exact finite action non-BPS bounce and bion solutions to the
holomorphic Newton equations. We find not only real solutions, but also complex
solution with non-trivial monodromy, and finally complex multi-valued and
singular solutions. Complex bions are necessary for obtaining the correct
non-perturbative structure of these models. In the supersymmetric limit the
complex solutions govern the ground state properties, and their contribution to
the semiclassical expansion is necessary to obtain consistency with the
supersymmetry algebra. The multi-valuedness of the action is either related to
the hidden topological angle or to the resurgent cancellation of ambiguities.
We also show that in the approximate multi-instanton description the
integration over the complex quasi-zero mode thimble produces the most salient
features of the exact solutions. While exact complex saddles are more difficult
to construct in quantum field theory, the relation to the approximate thimble
construction suggests that such solutions may be underlying some remarkable
features of approximate bion saddles in quantum field theories.

the anti-symmetric part of the cross-correlation function, that is dominated by
the relativistic signal and offers a new way to measure the relativistic terms
at relatively small scales. The analysis shows that relativistic effects are
important when considering cross-correlations between tracers with very
different biases, and should be included in the data analysis of the current

complementary to other techniques and observable trying to isolate the effect

entropy perturbations have vanishing bi- and trispectra during the ekpyrotic
phase. However, as we show, the conversion process to curvature perturbations
induces local non-Gaussianity parameters $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$ at levels that
should be detectable by near-future observations. In fact, in order to obtain a
large enough amplitude and small enough bispectrum of the curvature
perturbations, as seen in current measurements, the conversion process must be
very efficient. Interestingly, for such efficient conversions the trispectrum
parameter $g_{NL}$ remains negative and typically of a magnitude ${\cal
O}(10^2) - {\cal O}(10^3),$ resulting in a distinguishing feature of
non-minimally coupled ekpyrotic models.

offset from both the dust and the optical continuum that is located ~90kpc from
the AGN. The UV line emission has a complex structure in emission and
absorption. The line emission is mostly due to i) a large scale ionisation cone
energised by the AGN, ii) a Ly-alpha emitting bridge of gas between the radio
galaxy and a heavily star-forming set of components. Strangely, the ionisation
cone has no Ly-alpha emission. We find this is due to an optically thick layer

least ~100kpc from the AGN. Other, less thick absorption components are
associated with Ly-alpha emitting gas within a few tens of kpc from the radio

quench, the system is described by a non-equilibrium initial state, which
relaxes towards thermal equilibrium, featuring prethermal behavior on
intermediate time and length scales. The model corresponds to the class of
interacting Luttinger Liquids, which extends the quadratic Luttinger theory by
a weak integrability breaking phonon scattering term. In order to solve for the
non-equilibrium time evolution, we use kinetic equations for the phonon
densities, exploiting the resonant but subleading character of the phonon
interaction term. The interplay between phonon scattering and the quadratic
Luttinger theory leads to the emergence of three distinct spatio-temporal
regimes for the fermionic real-space correlation function. It features the
crossover from a prequench to a prethermal state, finally evolving towards a
thermal state on increasing length and time scales. The characteristic
algebraically decaying real-space correlations in the prethermalized regime
become modulated by an amplitude, which, as an effect of the interactions, is
decaying in time according to a stretched-exponential, while in the thermal
regime exponentially decaying real-space correlations emerge. The asymptotic
thermalization dynamics is governed by energy transport over large distances
from the thermalized to the non-thermalized regions, which is carried out by
macroscopic, dynamical slow modes. This is revealed in an algebraic decay of
the system's effective temperature. The numerical value of the associated
exponent agrees with the dynamical critical exponent of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
universality class, which shares with the present interacting Luttinger Liquid
the conservation of total energy and momentum.

energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated at flares and which by shock waves
driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The association of
the large ""gradual"" SEP events with shock acceleration is supported by the
extensive spatial distribution of SEPs and by the delayed acceleration of the
particles. The relative abundances of the elements in these gradual events are
a measure of those in the ambient solar corona, differing from those in the
photosphere by a widely-observed function of the first ionization potential
(FIP) of the elements. SEP events we call ""impulsive"", the traditional
""3He-rich"" events with enhanced heavy-element abundances, are associated with
type III radio bursts, flares, and narrow CMEs; they selectively populate flux
tubes that thread a localized source, and they are fit to new particle-in-cell
models of magnetic reconnection on open field lines as found in solar jets.
These models help explain the strong enhancements seen in heavy elements as a
power (of 2 - 8) in the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q throughout the periodic table
from He to Pb. A study of the temperature dependence of A/Q shows that the
source plasma in impulsive SEP events must lie in the range of 2-4 MK to
explain the pattern of abundances. This is much lower than the temperatures of
>10 MK seen on closed loops in solar flares. Recent studies of A/Q-dependent
enhancements or suppressions from scattering during transport show source
plasma temperatures in gradual SEP events to be 0.8-1.6 MK in 69% of the

$m^{-2}=\Delta (p=0)$, where $\Delta(p)$ is the scalar function for the gluon
propagator in some chosen gauge, it is not a pole mass and is generally
gauge-dependent, except in the gauge-invariant Pinch Technique (PT). We
truncate the PT equations with a new method called the vertex paradigm that
automatically satisfies the QED-like Ward identity relating the 3-gluon PT
vertex function with the PT propagator. The mass is determined by a homogeneous
Bethe-Salpeter equation involving this vertex and propagator. This gap equation
also encapsulates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless scalar
excitations, essentially Nambu-Goldstone fields, that necessarily accompany
gauge-invariant gluon mass. The problem is to find a good approximate value for
$m$ and at the same time explain the bulge, which by itself leads, in the gap
equation for the gluon mass, to excessively large values for the mass. Our
point is not to give a high-accuracy determination of $m$ but to clarify the
way in which the propagator bulge and a fairly accurate estimate of $m$ can
co-exist, and we use various approximations that illustrate the underlying
mechanisms. The most critical point is to satisfy the Ward identity. In the PT
we estimate a gauge-invariant dynamical gluon mass of $m \approx Ng^2/(2.48
\pi)$. We translate these results to the Landau gauge using a
background-quantum identity involving a dynamical quantity $\kappa$ such that
$m=\kappa m_L$, where $m_L^{-2}\equiv \Delta_L(p=0)$. Given our estimates for

driving fluid out. Similarly, injecting fluid into a porous material can expand
the pore space, distorting the solid skeleton. This poromechanical coupling has
applications ranging from tissue mechanics to hydrogeology. The classical
theory of linear poroelasticity captures this coupling by combining Darcy's law
with Terzaghi's effective stress and linear elasticity in a linearized
kinematic framework. Linear poroelasticity is a good model for very small
deformations, but it becomes increasingly inappropriate for moderate to large
deformations, which are common in the context of phenomena such as swelling and
damage, and for soft materials such as gels and tissues. The well-known theory
of large-deformation poroelasticity combines Darcy's law with Terzaghi's
effective stress and nonlinear elasticity in a rigorous kinematic framework.
This theory has been used extensively in biomechanics to model large elastic
deformations in soft tissues, and in geomechanics to model large elastoplastic
deformations in soils. Here, we first provide an overview and discussion of
this theory with an emphasis on the physics of poromechanical coupling. We
present the large-deformation theory in an Eulerian framework to minimize the
mathematical complexity, and we show how this nonlinear theory simplifies to
linear poroelasticity under the assumption of small strain. We then compare the
predictions of linear poroelasticity with those of large-deformation
poroelasticity in the context of two uniaxial model problems: Fluid outflow
driven by an applied mechanical load (the consolidation problem) and
compression driven by a steady fluid throughflow. We use these problems to
explore the steady and dynamical errors associated with the linear model in

this term has been dropped, since there has not been found any equation of

degenerate electron-positron plasmas. We also present the non-linear Pauli

underlying control parameter. Our scaling theory predicts new exponents,
exponent equalities and scaling collapses for energy, pressure and shear stress

It also yields new insight into why the shear and bulk moduli exhibit different
scalings; the difference arises because the shear stress vanishes as
$1/\sqrt{N}$ while the pressure approaches a constant in the thermodynamic

exhibits an emergent scale invariance, and that it should be possible to
develop a renormalization-group theory for jamming.

constrained both by solar system experiments and by binary pulsar observations,
a large set of ST families remain consistent with these observations. Recent
work has suggested probing the unconstrained region of the parameter space of

Here, the dynamical evolution of very compact stars in a fully nonlinear code
demonstrates that the stars do become unstable and that the instability, in
some cases, drives the stars to collapse. We discuss the implications of these

subject to the instability for a certain regime; its existence therefore
supports a bound on the ST parameter space.

time-evolution equations for the hydrodynamic variables with three kinds of
terms on the right-hand sides: reversible, dissipative and fluctuating terms.

nonlocal terms in space and time which describe nonlocal memory effects.
Applying a few approximations the nonlocal properties and the memory effects
are removed. As a result we find the well known hydrodynamic equations of a
normal fluid with Gaussian fluctuating forces. In the following we investigate
if and how the time-inversion invariance is broken and how the second law of
thermodynamics comes about. Furthermore, we show that the hydrodynamic
equations with fluctuating forces are equivalent to stochastic Langevin

the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. One search disk

$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29""$, and the other
(B) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on
$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151""$. We explored the
frequency range of 50-1500 Hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times
10^{-9}$ Hz/s. A multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probing
more deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence length
with every stage.
  Rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70
candidates, to be examined manually. None of those 70 candidates proved to be
consistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidence
level upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. Near $169$
Hz we achieve our lowest 95% CL upper limit on worst-case linearly polarized
strain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of our
frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ for
all polarizations and sky locations.

is encoded by a unitary modular (tensor) category (UMC). A group symmetry of
the topological phase induces a group symmetry of its corresponding UMC.
Gauging is a well-known theoretical tool to promote a global symmetry to a
local gauge symmetry. We give a mathematical formulation of gauging in terms of
higher category formalism. Roughly, given a UMC with a symmetry group $G$,
gauging is a 2-step process: first extend the UMC to a $G$-crossed braided
fusion category and then take the equivariantization of the resulting category.
Gauging can tell whether or not two enriched topological phases of matter are
different, and also provides a way to construct new UMCs out of old ones. We
derive a formula for the $H^4$-obstruction, prove some properties of gauging,
and carry out gauging for two concrete examples.

frequency-dependent (chromatic) structure in antenna beam patterns. Chromatic
beams couple angular structures in Galactic foreground emission to spectral
structures that may not be removed by smooth functional forms. We report
results for simulations based on two dipole antennas used by the Experiment to
Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES). The residual levels in simulated
foreground-subtracted spectra are found to differ substantially between the two
antennas, suggesting that antenna design must be carefully considered.
Residuals are also highly dependent on the right ascension and declination of
the antenna pointing, with RMS values differing by as much as a factor of 20
across pointings. For EDGES and other ground-based experiments with zenith
pointing antennas, right ascension and declination correspond directly to the
local sidereal time and the latitude of the deployment site, hence chromatic
beam effects should be taken into account when selecting sites. We introduce
the ""blade"" dipole antenna and show, via simulations, that it has better
chromatic performance than the ""fourpoint"" antenna previously used for EDGES.
The blade antenna yields 1-5~mK residuals across the entire sky after a 5-term
polynomial is removed from simulated spectra, whereas the fourpoint antenna
typically requires a 6-term polynomial for comparable residuals. For both
antennas, the signal-to-noise ratio of recovered 21 cm input signals peaks for
a 5-term polynomial foreground fit given realistic thermal noise levels.

generalize the inverse and implicit function theorem (in differential, analytic
and algebraic setting) to sets of functions of larger multiplicities (or
ideals). This allows one to describe singularities given by a finite set of
generators or by ideals in a simpler form. In the special Cohen-Macaulay case
we obtain a singular analog of the inverse function theorem. The singular
implicit function theorem is closely related to a (proven here) extended
version of the Weierstrass-Hironaka-Malgrange division and preparation
theorems. The primary motivation for this paper comes from the
desingularization problem. As an illustration of the techniques used, we give
some applications of our theorems to desingularization extending some results
on Hironaka normal flatness, the Samuel stratification and the Hilbert-Samuel
function. The notion of the standard basis along Samuel stratum introduced in
the paper (inspired by the Bierstone-Milman and Hironaka constructions) allows
us to describe singularities along the Samuel stratum in a relatively simple
way. It leads to a canonical reduction of the strong Hironaka desingularization
with normally flat centers to a so called resolution of marked ideals.
Moreover, in characteristic zero, the standard basis along Samuel stratum
generates a unique canonical Rees algebra along Samuel startum giving a
straightforward proof of the strong desingularization in algebraic and analytic
cases.

supergraph identification problems for a large variety of target properties.
They have also attracted significant attention in recent years, particularly in
the area of parameterized complexity as the problems have rich parameter
ecologies.
  In this paper we examine generalisations of the notion of editing a graph to
obtain a regular subgraph. In particular we extend the notion of regularity to
include two variants of edge-regularity along with the unifying constraint of
strong regularity. We present a number of results, with the central observation
that these problems retain the general complexity profile of their
regularity-based inspiration: when the number of edits $k$ and the maximum
degree $r$ are taken together as a combined parameter, the problems are
tractable (i.e. in \FPT{}), but are otherwise intractable.
  We also examine variants of the basic editing to obtain a regular subgraph
problem from the perspective of parameterizing by the treewidth of the input

support Earth-like life. Focusing on planets orbiting Red Dwarf (RD) stars, the
most abundant stellar type, we show that including RDs as potential host stars
could increase the probability of finding biotic planets by a factor of up to a
thousand, and reduce the estimate of the distance to our nearest biotic
neighbor by up to 10. We argue that binary and multiple star systems need to be
taken into account when discussing exoplanet habitability. Early considerations
indicated that conditions on RD planets would be inimical to life, as their
Habitable Zones (where liquid water could exist) would be so close as to make
planets tidally locked to their star. This was thought to cause an erratic
climate and expose life forms to flares of ionizing radiation. Recent
calculations show that these negative factors are less severe than originally
thought. It has been argued that the lesser photon energy of the radiation of
the relatively cool RDs would not suffice for Oxygenic Photosynthesis (OP) and
other related energy expending reactions. Numerous authors suggest that OP on
RD planets may evolve to utilize photons in the infrared. We however argue, by
analogy to the evolution of OP and the environmental physiology and
distribution of land-based vegetation on Earth, that the evolutionary pressure
to utilize infrared radiation would be small. This is because vegetation on RD
planets could enjoy continuous illumination of moderate intensity, containing a
significant component of photosynthetic 400-700 nm radiation. We conclude that
conditions for OP could exist on RD planets and consequently the evolution of
complex life might be possible. Furthermore, the huge number and the long
lifetime of RDs make it more likely to find planets with photosynthesis and
life around RDs than around solar type stars.

accretion of He-rich matter onto CO WDs and explore a scenario in which a
strong wind forms on the surface of the WD if the total luminosity exceeds the
Eddington limit. Using a stellar evolution code called modules for experiments
in stellar astrophysics (MESA), we simulated the He accretion process onto CO
WDs for WDs with masses of 0.6-1.35Msun and various accretion rates of
10^{-8}-10^{-5}Msun/yr. If the contribution of the total luminosity is included
when determining the Eddington accretion rate, then a super-Eddington wind
could be triggered at relatively lower accretion rates than those of previous
studies based on steady-state models. The super-Eddington wind can prevent the
WDs with high accretion rates from evolving into red-giant-like He stars. We
found that the contributions from thermal energy of the WD are non-negligible,
judging by our simulations, even though the nuclear burning energy is the
dominating source of luminosity. We also provide the limits of the steady
He-burning regime in which the WDs do not lose any accreted matter and increase
their mass steadily, and calculated the mass retention efficiency during He
layer flashes for various WD masses and accretion rates. These obtained results
can be used in future binary population synthesis computations.

Although the cluster's underlying mass distribution is one of the critical

the galaxy distribution, however in contrast with the relatively simple binary

dominated by the two most massive clumps aligned north-south with a ~3:1 mass

the current weak-lensing result with the X-ray, galaxy, and radio-relic

peculiarity of the morphology necessitates involvement of additional

electron saturation current. The common assumption is that the probe collects
the random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies that
there is no electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity
space truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This
work provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they
are not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC)
simulations, a 1D model for the electron sheath and presheath is developed. In
the model, under low temperature plasma conditions ($T_e\gg T_i$), an electron
pressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity
that exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure
gradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by
ballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many
situations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much
further into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal
that the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around
the electron sheath and that this flow is due to 2D aspects of the sheath
geometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited
by the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which
result in sheath edge fluctuations. The 1D model and time averaged PIC
simulations are compared and it is shown that the model provides a good
description of the electron sheath and presheath.

jointly) to explore five popular dark energy models under assumption of spatial
flatness of the Universe. As standard rulers, we used a data set comprising 118
galactic-scale strong lensing systems (individual standard rulers if properly
calibrated for the mass density profile) combined with BAO diagnostics
(statistical standard ruler). Supernovae Ia served asstandard candles. Unlike
in the most of previous statistical studies involving strong lensing systems,
we relaxed the assumption of singular isothermal sphere (SIS) in favor of its
generalization: the power-law mass density profile. Therefore, along with
cosmological model parameters we fitted the power law index and its first
derivative with respect to the redshift (thus allowing for mass density profile
evolution). It turned out that the best fitted $\gamma$ parameters are in
agreement with each other irrespective of the cosmological model considered.
This demonstrates that galactic strong lensing systems may provide a
complementary probe to test the properties of dark energy. Fits for
cosmological model parameters which we obtained are in agreement with
alternative studies performed by the others. Because standard rulers and
standard candles have different parameter degeneracies, combination of standard
rulers and standard candles gives much more restrictive results for
cosmological parameters. At last, we attempted at model selection based on
information theoretic criteria (AIC and BIC). Our results support the claim,
that cosmological constant model is still the best one and there is no (at
least statistical) reason to prefer any other more complex model.

decades due to their interesting physical properties. Recently, much attention
has been paid to the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of these RTX compounds,

low temperature magnetic refrigeration. In this paper, we review the MCE of
RTSi and RTAl systems with R = Gd~Tm, T = Fe~Cu and Pd, which are widely
investigated in recent years. It is found that these RTX compounds exhibit
various crystal structures and magnetic properties, which then result in
different MCE. Large MCE has been observed not only in the typical
ferromagnetic materials but also in the antiferromagnetic materials. The
magnetic properties have been studied in detail to discuss the physical
mechanism of large MCE in RTX compounds. Particularly, some RTX compounds, such
as ErFeSi, HoCuSi, HoCuAl, etc, exhibit large reversible MCE under low magnetic
field change, which suggests that these compounds could be promising materials
for magnetic refrigeration in low temperature range.

relaying under statistical delay constraints, imposed on the limitations of the

assumed that there are queues of infinite size at both the source and relay
node, and the source can select the relay or destination for data reception.
Given selection relaying policy, the effective bandwidth of the arrival
processes of the queue at the relay is derived. Then, the maximum constant
arrival rate can be identified as the maximum effective capacity as a function
of the statistical end-to-end queueing delay constraints, signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) at the source and relay, the fading distributions of the links,
and the relay policy. Subsequently, a relay policy that incorporates the
statistical delay constraints is proposed. It is shown that the proposed relay
policy can achieve better performance than existing protocols. Moreover, it is
demonstrated that buffering relay model can still help improve the throughput
of relay systems in the presence of statistical delay constraints and

and 2) assessing feasibility of classification. Dimensionality reduction
assumes that the data lie on a manifold with dimension less than that of the
feature space. However, previous HFO analyses have assumed a linear manifold,
global across time, space (i.e. recording electrode/channel), and individual

b) the consistency of the manifold across time, space, and patients. We also
estimate bounds on the Bayes classification error to quantify the distinction

large-scale power deficit {\xi}(k) which for a radiation-dominated expansion is
found to have an approximate inverse-tangent dependence on k (assuming that the
width of the initial distribution is smaller than the width of the initial

form of {\xi}(k) is robust under changes in the initial nonequilibrium

under the addition of an inflationary era at the end of the radiation-dominated

function of k. Furthermore, with the inflationary phase the dependence of the
fitting parameters on the number of superposed pre-inflationary energy states

spatially explicit three species food chain model, where the top predator is
subjected to a strong Allee effect.
  We show the existence of a global attractor for the the model, that is upper
semicontinuous in the Allee threshold parameter $m$. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first robustness result, for a spatially explicit three
species food chain model with an Allee effect. Next, we numerically investigate
the decay rate to a target attractor, that is when $m=0$, in terms of $m$. We

middle predator. In particular overexploitation is not possible without an
Allee effect in place. We also uncover a rich class of Turing patterns in the

  International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM

by aligning them to the road network on a digital map. A growing number of
applications, e.g. energy-efficient localization and cellular provider side
localization, depend on the availability of only sparse and coarse-grained
positioning data; leading to a challenging map matching process.
  In this paper, we present semMatch: a system that can provide accurate
HMM-based map matching for challenging positioning traces. semMatch leverages
the smartphone's inertial sensors to detect different road semantics; such as
speed bumps, tunnels, and turns; and uses them in a mathe-matically-principled
way as hints to overcome the sparse, noisy, and coarse-grained input
positioning data, improving the HMM map matching accuracy and efficiency. To do
that, semMatch applies a series of preprocessing modules to handle the noisy
locations. The filtered location data is then processed by the core of semMatch
system using a novel incremental HMM algorithm that combines a
semantics-enriched digital map and the car's ambient road semantics in its
estimation process.
  We have evaluated semMatch using traces collected from different cities
covering more than 150km under different harsh scenarios including
coarse-grained cellular-based positioning data, sparse GPS traces with
extremely low sampling rate, and noisy traces with a large number of
back-and-force transitions. The results show that semMatch significantly
outperforms traditional map matching algorithms under all scenarios, with an
enhancement of at least 416% and 894% in precision and recall respectively in
the most difficult cases. This highlights its promise as a next generation map
matching algorithm for challenging environments.

diffusion regions (EDR). EDR are regions in proximity of reconnection sites
where electrons decouple from field lines, breaking the frozen in condition.
Decades of research on reconnection have produced a widely shared map of where
EDRs are. We expect reconnection to take place around a so called x-point
formed by the intersection of the separatrices dividing inflowing from
outflowing plasma. The EDR forms around this x-point as a small electron scale
box nested inside a larger ion diffusion region. But this point of view is
based on a 2D mentality. We have recently proposed that once the problem is
considered in full 3D, secondary reconnection events can form [Lapenta et al.,
Nature Physics, 11, 690, 2015] in the outflow regions even far downstream from
the primary reconnection site. We revisit here this new idea confirming that
even using additional indicators of reconnection and even considering longer
periods and wider distances the conclusion remains true: secondary reconnection
sites form downstream of a reconnection outflow causing a sort of chain
reaction of cascading reconnection sites. If we are right, MMS will have an
interesting journey even when not crossing necessarily the primary site. The
chances are greatly increased that even if missing a primary site during an
orbit, MMS could stumble instead on one of these secondary sites.

differential equations. The main purpose is to determine an approximation of
controls that drives the solution from a prescribed initial state at the

example, we mainly focus on the Stokes system for which the existence of
square-integrable controls have been obtained in [Fursikov \& Imanuvilov,
Controllability of Evolution Equations, 1996]) via Carleman type estimates. We
introduce a least-squares formulation of the controllability problem, and we
show that it allows the construction of strong convergent sequences of
functions toward null controls for the Stokes system. The approach consists
first in introducing a class of functions satisfying a priori the boundary
conditions in space and time-in particular the null controllability condition
at time T-, and then finding among this class one element satisfying the
system. This second step is done by minimizing a quadratic functional, among
the admissible corrector functions of the Stokes system. We also discuss
briefly the direct problem for the steady Navier-Stokes system. The method does
not make use of any duality arguments and therefore avoid the ill-posedness of

of a thick molecular torus that may hide the broad emission line region from
the view of observers near the equatorial direction. In this configuration, one
may expect that the far UV radiation from the central engine can be Raman
scattered by neutral hydrogen to reappear around Balmer and Paschen emission
lines which can be identified with broad wings. We produce H$\alpha$, H$\beta$
and Pa$\alpha$ wings using a Monte Carlo technique to investigate their
properties. The neutral scattering region is assumed to be a cylindrical torus
specified by the inner and outer radii and the height. While the covering
factor of the scattering region affects the overall strengths of the wings, the
wing widths are primarily dependent on the neutral hydrogen column density
$N_{\rm HI}$ being roughly proportional to $N_{\rm HI}^{1/2}$. In particular,
with $N_{\rm HI}=10^{23}{\rm\ cm^{-2}}$ the H$\alpha$ wings typically show a
width $\sim 2\times 10^4{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$. We also find that H$\alpha$ and

characteristic ICME parameters such as the impact speed, southward magnetic
field strength (Bz). The majority of ICMEs causes a distinct density
enhancement in the thermosphere, with up to a factor of eight compared to the
pre-event level. We find high correlations between ICME Bz and thermospheric
density enhancements (~0.9), while the correlation with the ICME impact speed
is somewhat smaller (~0.7). The geomagnetic indices revealing the highest

the magnetic structure of the ICME, we find that the Dst and SYM-H reveal a
tighter relation to the Bz minimum in the magnetic structure of the ICME,
whereas the polar cap indices show higher correlations with the Bz minimum in
the shock sheath region. Since the strength of the Bz component - either in the

subsequently slow the growth of small-scale structure and, via feedback
processes, can influence the formation of larger galaxies. We examine the
effect of streaming velocities on the galaxy correlation function, including
all leading-order contributions for the first time. We find that the impact on
the BAO peak is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of ~5) over the results of
previous investigations, with the primary new effect due to advection: if a
galaxy retains memory of the primordial streaming velocity, it does so at its
Lagrangian, rather than Eulerian, position. Since correlations in the streaming
velocity change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a
significant shift in the observed BAO position. If streaming velocities impact
tracer density at the 1% level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO
scale is shifted by approximately 0.5%. This new effect, which is required to
preserve Galilean invariance, greatly increases the importance of including
streaming velocities in the analysis of upcoming BAO measurements and opens a
new window to the astrophysics of galaxy formation.

dust growth model incorporating sintering and use it to simulate global dust
evolution due to sintering, coagulation, fragmentation, and radial inward drift
in a modeled HL Tau disk. We show that aggregates consisting of multiple
species of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile
up at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At
wavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically
thick rings with a spectral slope of $\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering
zones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\approx$
2.3--2.5. The observational features of the sintering and non-sintering zones
are consistent with those of the major bright and dark rings found in the HL

simultaneously if disk turbulence is weak and if monomers constituting the
aggregates are $\sim 1~{\rm \mu m}$ in radius. For the radial gas temperature

(HTSs) and permanent magnet guideway (PMG) is deemed promising technique for

reduce the investment of this superconducting levitation transit, the
optimization of the PMG is the most critical issue of practical interest since
it serves as the continuous rail to generate the magnetic field by the
rare-earth magnets. By the use of a generalized vector potential within the
quasistatic approximation as the state variable to mathematically describe the
HTS as well as the surrounding medium, an efficient scheme for optimizing the
superconducting levitation has been developed with the genetic algorithm as a
strategy to perform the global search of the PMG. This scheme directly
describes the HTS element without simplification of its intractable

i.e., the time cost is merely 3.6 hours with 3000 individuals evaluated on a
moderate desktop. Taking a HTS over the Halbach-derived PMG as a practice, a
set of case studies were carried out to understand how the working condition,
geometrical and material characteristics of the HTS affect its maximum
levitation force achievable at different constraints of the cross-section of
the PMG. The findings attained by the case studies, being inaccessible from the
experiments, are aimed to provide useful implications for the optimization of a

conventional paramagnetic metals. For the development of TI-based spin current
devices, it is essential to evaluate its conversion efficiency quantitatively
as a function of the Fermi level EF position. Here we exemplify a coefficient
of qICS to characterize the interface C-S conversion effect by using spin
torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) for (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 thin films whose EF
is tuned across the band gap. In bulk insulating conditions, interface C-S
conversion effect via Dirac surface state is evaluated as nearly constant large
values of qICS, reflecting that the qICS is inversely proportional to the Fermi
velocity vF that is almost constant. However, when EF traverses through the
Dirac point, the qICS is remarkably suppressed possibly due to the degeneracy
of surface spins or instability of helical spin structure. These results
demonstrate that the fine tuning of the EF in TI based heterostructures is
critical to maximizing the efficiency using the spin-momentum locking
mechanism.

models explaining the periodic variations in spin-down and beam-width of PSR
B1828-11. The available data consists of the time averaged spin-down rate,
which displays a distinctive double-peaked modulation, and measurements of the
beam-width. Two concepts exist in the literature that are capable of explaining
these variations; we formulate predictive models from these and quantitatively
compare them. The first concept is phenomenological and stipulates that the
magnetosphere undergoes periodic switching between two meta-stable states as
first suggested by Lyne et al. The second concept, precession, was first
considered as a candidate for the modulation of B1828-11 by Stairs et al.. We
quantitatively compare models built from these concepts using a Bayesian
odds-ratio. Because the phenomenological switching model itself was informed by
this data in the first place, it is difficult to specify appropriate
parameter-space priors that can be trusted for an unbiased model comparison.
Therefore we first perform a parameter estimation using the spin-down data, and
then use the resulting posterior distributions as priors for model comparison
on the beam-width data. We find that a precession model with a simple circular
Gaussian beam geometry fails to appropriately describe the data, while allowing
for a more general beam geometry provides a good fit to the data. The resulting
odds between the precession model (with a general beam geometry) and the
switching model are estimated as $10^{2.7 \pm 0.5}$ in favour of the precession
model.

zirconium-based alloy Zr65.0Al7.5Cu27.5 (ZAC) are prepared and their
phase-shifting properties are tested. The ZAC-alloy film is investigated by

compute the different levels independently. The search for parameters is
carried out using sample average approximation, which basically consists in
applying deterministic optimisation techniques to a Monte Carlo approximation
rather than resorting to stochastic approximation. Our innovative estimator
leads to a robust and efficient procedure reducing both the discretization
error (the bias) and the variance for a given computational effort. In the
setting of discretized diffusions, we prove that our estimator satisfies a
strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem with optimal limiting
variance, in the sense that this is the variance achieved by the best
importance sampling measure (among the class of changes we consider), which is

large region. Our main motive is to localize humans by localizing their WiFi
devices, e.g. during search-and-rescue operations after a natural disaster. We
use an active sensing approach that relies on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
to collect signal-strength measurements at informative locations. The problem
is challenging since the measurement is received at arbitrary times and they
are received only when the UAV is in close proximity to the device. For these
reasons, it is extremely important to make prudent decision with very few
measurements. We use the Bayesian optimization approach based on Gaussian

give reliable predictions with very few measurements while Bayesian
optimization makes a judicious trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
In field experiments conducted over a region of 1000 $\times$ 1000 $m^2$, we

embedded in a tubular membrane. We model inclusions as constraints coupled to
the curvature tensor of the membrane tube. First, as special test cases, we
analyze the interaction between ring and rod shaped inclusions. Using Monte
Carlo simulations, we further show how point-like inclusions interact to form
linear aggregates. Our results reveal that depending on the hard-core radius of
the inclusions, they arrange into either lines or rings to globally minimize
the curvature energy of the membrane.

flares are routinely observed on Sun-like stars, raising the question of
whether the same physical processes are responsible for both solar and stellar
flares. In this letter we present a white-light stellar superflare on the star
KIC9655129, observed by NASA's Kepler mission, with a rare multi-period
quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP) pattern. Two significant periodic processes were
detected using the wavelet and autocorrelation techniques, with periods of 78
+/- 12 min and 32 +/- 2 min. By comparing the phases and decay times of the two
periodicities, the QPP signal was found to most likely be linear, suggesting
that the two periodicities are independent, possibly corresponding either to
different magnetohydrodynamic modes of the flaring region, or different spatial
harmonics of the same mode. The presence of multiple periodicities is a good
indication that the QPPs were caused by magnetohydrodynamic oscillations, and
suggests that the physical processes in operation during stellar flares could
be the same as those in solar flares.

pair of vertices there exists a path which uses each color at most once. The
rainbow connection number, denoted by $rc(G)$, is the minimum number of colors
needed to make $G$ rainbow connected. Along with its variants, which consider
vertex colorings and/or so-called strong colorings, the rainbow connection
number has been studied from both the algorithmic and graph-theoretic points of
view.
  In this paper we present a range of new results on the computational
complexity of computing the four major variants of the rainbow connection
number. In particular, we prove that the \textsc{Strong Rainbow Vertex
Coloring} problem is $NP$-complete even on graphs of diameter $3$. We show that
when the number of colors is fixed, then all of the considered problems can be
solved in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Moreover, we provide a
linear-time algorithm which decides whether it is possible to obtain a rainbow
coloring by saving a fixed number of colors from a trivial upper bound.
Finally, we give a linear-time algorithm for computing the exact rainbow
connection numbers for three variants of the problem on graphs of bounded
vertex cover number.

chemical reactions. In this investigation, climbing image nudged elastic band
(CINEB) method, within the framework of density functional theory, is used to
report the activation energies (E a ) of water dissociation on Cu(111) surface
with a vacancy. Introduction of vacancy results in a reduced coordination of
the dissociated products, which facilitates their availability for reactions
that involve water dissociation as an intermediate step. Activation energy for
dissociation of water reduces by nearly 0.2 eV on Cu(111) surface with vacancy,
in comparison with that of pristine Cu(111) surface. We also find that surface
modification of the Cu upper surface is one of the possible pathways to
dissociate water when the vacancy is introduced. Activation energy, and the
minimum energy path (MEP) leading to the transition state remain same for
various product configurations. CINEB corresponding to hydrogen gas evolution
is also performed which shows that it is a two step process involving water
dissociation. We conclude that the introduction of vacancy facilitates the
water dissociation reaction, by reducing the activation energy by about 20%.

search of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on Virgo VSR2 and
VSR4 data. The search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 Hz and
128 Hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ Hz/s and $+1.5
\times 10^{-11}$ Hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. The starting
point was a set of short Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), of length 8192 seconds,
built from the calibrated strain data. Aggressive data cleaning, both in the
time and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much as
possible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. On each dataset a
number of candidates has been selected, using the FrequencyHough transform in
an incoherent step. Only coincident candidates among VSR2 and VSR4 have been
examined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the most
significant candidates have been selected. Selected candidates have been
subject to a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer FFTs followed by a
further incoherent analysis, still based on the FrequencyHough transform. No
evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals was found, therefore we have
set a population-based joint VSR2-VSR4 90$\%$ confidence level upper limit on
the dimensionless gravitational wave strain in the frequency range between 20
Hz and 128 Hz. This is the first all-sky search for continuous gravitational
waves conducted, on data of ground-based interferometric detectors, at
frequencies below 50 Hz. We set upper limits in the range between about
$10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ at most frequencies. Our upper limits on
signal strain show an improvement of up to a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to
the results of previous all-sky searches at frequencies below $80~\mathrm{Hz}$.

the case of rational functions, or, more generally, meromorphic functions f/g,
with coefficients in a local field of characteristic zero. This generalization
is far from being straightforward due to the fact that several new geometric
phenomena appear. Also, the oscillatory integrals have two different asymptotic
expansions: the 'usual' one when the norm of the parameter tends to infinity,
and another one when the norm of the parameter tends to zero. The first
asymptotic expansion is controlled by the poles (with negative real parts) of
all the twisted local zeta functions associated to the meromorphic functions
f/g - c, for certain special values c. The second expansion is controlled by
the poles (with positive real parts) of all the twisted local zeta functions

modeling (binary) joint distributions. Meanwhile, as a result of their
confining network structure, training RBMs confronts less difficulties
(compared with more complicated models, e.g., Boltzmann machines) when dealing
with approximation and inference issues. However, in certain computational
biology scenarios, such as the cancer data analysis, employing RBMs to model
data features may lose its efficacy due to the ""$p\gg N$"" problem, in which the
number of features/predictors is much larger than the sample size. The ""$p\gg
N$"" problem puts the bias-variance trade-off in a more crucial place when
designing statistical learning methods. In this manuscript, we try to address
this problem by proposing a novel RBM model, called elastic restricted
Boltzmann machine (eRBM), which incorporates the elastic regularization term
into the likelihood/cost function. We provide several theoretical analysis on
the superiority of our model. Furthermore, attributed to the classic
contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, eRBMs can be trained efficiently. Our
novel model is a promising method for future cancer data analysis.

sensitive techniques we have obtained evidence of such surface chemical
self-structuration in as-prepared crystals and unambiguously identified the
local composition. The contact surface potential at regions initially
consisting of majority single terminations (SrO and TiO2) is determined to be
smaller for SrO than for TiO2, in agreement with theoretical predictions,
although the measured difference below 100 meV is definitely smaller than
theoretical predictions for ideally pure single-terminated SrO and TiO2
surfaces. These relative values are maintained if samples are annealed in UHV
up to 200 degrees Celsius. Annealing in UHV at higher temperature (400 degrees
Celsius) preserves the surface morphology of self-assembled TiO2 and SrO rich
regions, although a non-negligible chemical intermixing is observed. The most
dramatic consequence is that the surface potential is reversed. It thus follows
that electronic and chemical properties of (001)SrTiO3, widely used in oxide

standard starting point for almost all multireference approaches required for
strongly-correlated molecular problems. The limitation of the approach is
generally given by the number of strongly-correlated orbitals in the molecule,
as its cost will grow exponentially with this number. We present a new
multi-configurational self-consistent field approach, wherein linear
determinant coefficients of a multi-configurational wavefunction are optimized
via the stochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo technique
at greatly reduced computational cost, with non-linear orbital rotation
parameters updated variationally based on this sampled wavefunction. This
extends this approach to strongly-correlated systems with far larger active
spaces than it is possible to treat by conventional means. By comparison with
this traditional approach, we demonstrate that the introduction of stochastic
noise in both the determinant amplitudes and the gradient and Hessian of the
orbital rotations does not preclude robust and reliable convergence of the
orbital optimization. It can even improve the ability to avoid convergence to
local minima in the orbital space, and therefore aid in finding variationally
lower-energy solutions. We consider the effect on the convergence of the
orbitals as the number of walkers and the sampling time within the active space
increases, as well as the effect on the final energy and error. The scope of
the new protocol is demonstrated with a study of the increasingly strongly
correlated electronic structure in a series of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, up to the large coronene molecule in a complete active space of

Cmax(3D)=0.326 (0.001). The second rule establishes permission to break the
first one with certain probability 0<=p<=1, thus the occupied sites can start
to share edges when p>0. In this case higher then 0.3638 concentrations are
accessible, even up to C=1. Therefore the percolation threshold Pc can be
reached. Its value depends on the value of the probability p. Our model
describes the kinetics of formation of thin films of particles attracted by the
substrate but repulsing each other.

compilation procedure synthesises deadlock-free, concurrent, and distributed
communicating processes from global, declarative descriptions of
communications, called choreographies. Previous work used choreographies for
the synthesis of programs. Alas, there is no formalisation that provides a
chain of correctness from choreographies to their implementations. This problem
originates from the gap between existing theoretical models, which abstract
communications using channel names (\`a la CCS/{\pi}-calculus), and their
implementations, which use low-level mechanisms for message routing. As a
solution, we propose the theoretical framework of Applied Choreographies. In
the framework, developers write choreographies in a language that follows the
standard syntax and name-based communication semantics of previous works. Then,
they use a compilation procedure to transform a choreography into a low-level,
implementation-adherent calculus of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC). To manage
the complexity of the compilation, we divide its formalisation and proof in
three stages, respectively dealing with: a) the translation of name-based
communications into their SOC equivalents (namely, using correlation mechanisms
based on message data); b) the projection of a choreography into a composition
of partial, single-participant choreographies (towards their translation into
SOC processes); c) the translation of partial choreographies and the
distribution of choreography-level state into SOC processes. We provide results
of behavioural correspondence for each stage. Thus, given a choreography
specification, we guarantee to synthesise its faithful and deadlock-free
service-oriented implementation.

the Dickson polynomial. Aly and Winterhof obtained a lower bound on the linear
complexity profile of a Dickson generator. Moreover Vasiga and Shallit studied
the state diagram given by the Dickson polynomial of degree two. However, they
do not specify sets of initial values which generate a long period sequence. In
this paper, we show conditions for parameters and initial values to generate
long period sequences, and asymptotic properties for periods by numerical
experiments. We specify sets of initial values which generate a long period
sequence. For suitable parameters, every element of this set occurs exactly
once as a component of generating sequence in one period. In order to obtain
sets of initial values, we consider a logistic generator proposed by Miyazaki,
Araki, Uehara and Nogami, which is obtained from a Dickson generator of degree
two with a linear transformation. Moreover, we remark on the linear complexity
profile of the logistic generator. The sets of initial values are described by
values of the Legendre symbol. The main idea is to introduce a structure of a
hyperbola to the sets of initial values. Our results ensure that generating

evolution. In close encounters, the transfer of angular momentum mediated by
the dynamical response of massive, extended haloes can reverse the direction of
orbital motion of the central galaxies after their first passage. Tidal
response is strongly correlated with the ratio $v_\mathrm{e} / v_\mathrm{c}$ of
escape to circular velocity within the participating discs. Moreover, the same
ratio also correlates with the rate at which tidal tails are reaccreted by
their galaxies of origin; consequently, merger remnants with `twin tails', such

can provide useful constraints on progenitor structure. In particular,
encounters in which halo dynamics reverses orbital motion exhibit a distinctive
morphology which may be recognized observationally. Detailed models attempting

of two-qubit density matrices for all ranks are given in terms of $R_{12}$.
Ansatz states satisfying these bounds are given and verified using various
numerical methods. In rank-2 case it is shown that the states satisfying the
lower bound on $R_{12}$ {\it vs} concurrence define a class of three qubit
states that maximizes the tripartite entanglement (the 3-tangle) given an
amount of entanglement between a pair of them. The measure $R_{12}$ is
conjectured, via numerical sampling, to be always larger than the concurrence
and negativity. In particular this is shown to be true for the physically
interesting case of $X$ states.

$\eta_\mathrm{EW}$ is the electroweak correction factor. Alternatively,
assuming the model-independent form-factor parameterization of Boyd, Grinstein

near the linear regime. For weak precompression, conical wave propagation is
still possible, but the resulting expanding circular wave front is of a
non-oscillatory nature, resulting from the complex interplay between the
discreteness, nonlinearity and geometry of the packing. The transition between
these two types of propagation is explored.

to this target by the INTEGRAL mission, and focus on the spectral behavior in
the hard X-ray domain, using both SPI and IBIS instruments. The source exhibits
extreme variability, and reaches fluxes of several tens of Crab. However, the
emission between 20 and 650 keV can be understood in terms of two main
components, varying on all the observable timescales, similar to what is
observed in the persistent black hole system Cyg X-1. The low energy component
(up to ~ 200 keV) presents a rather unusual shape, probably due to the
intrinsic source variability. Nonetheless, a satisfactory description is
obtained with a Comptonization model, if an unusually hot population of seed
photons ($kT_0$ ~ 7 keV) is introduced. Above this first component, a clear
excess extending up to 400-600 keV leads us to investigate a scenario where an
additional (cutoff) power law could correspond to the contribution of the jet
synchrotron emission, as proposed in Cyg X-1. A search for an annihilation
feature did not provide any firm detection, with an upper limit of 2 x $10^{-4}

evaluating the weight of two objects) and socio-cognitive uncertainty (e.g.,
evaluating which is the most suitable item in a specific context), and measured
by the participants' conformation to the iCub's answers to specific questions.
In particular, we were interested in understanding whether specific (i)
user-related features (i.e. desire for control), (ii) robot-related features
(i.e., attitude towards social influence of robots), and (iii) context-related
features (i.e., collaborative vs. competitive scenario), may influence their
trust towards the iCub robot. We found that participants conformed more to the
iCub's answers when their decisions were about functional issues than when they
were about social issues. Moreover, the few participants conforming to the
iCub's answers for social issues also conformed less for functional issues.
Trust in the robot's functional savvy does not thus seem to be a pre-requisite
for trust in its social savvy. Finally, desire for control, attitude towards
social influence of robots and type of interaction scenario did not influence
the trust in iCub. Results are discussed with relation to methodology of HRI

addresses the multidimensional nature of other accompanying physical processes
stochastically; thus reducing the complexity of their computation. This model
exhibits the experimentally observed features of solid surfaces that evolve
under continuous particle irradiation and allows for a way to study the effect
of the different mechanisms of the surface morphology and the nature of their
interplay in the dynamics of the surface evolution. Our study of the average
surface height reveals that it is constant when eroded particles are
redeposited but varies linearly with simulation time, when eroded particles are
not redeposited. Our studies also show that the roughening process is not

approach for understanding stochastic and spatial chemical kinetics. An

volume exclusion effects on stochastic kinetics due to a finite molecular
radius. We obtain an exact closed form solution of the RDME and of the cRDME
for a general chemical system in equilibrium conditions. The difference between
the two solutions increases with the ratio of molecular diameter to the
compartment length scale. We show that an increase in molecular crowding can
(i) lead to deviations from the classical inverse square root law for the
noise-strength; (ii) flip the skewness of the probability distribution from
right to left-skewed; (iii) shift the equilibrium of bimolecular reactions so
that more product molecules are formed; (iv) strongly modulate the Fano factors

particularly pronounced for chemical species not involved in chemical

similar SUSY structure for many common models of antiferromagnets including the

parameters of the interval exchange transformation, then minimality may become
an ""exotic"" property. We conjecture in this paper that this occurs if and only
if the linear restrictions contain a Lagrangian subspace of the first homology
of the suspension surface. We partially prove it in the ""only if"" direction and
provide a series of examples to support the converse one. We show that the

Sufficient sampling is either required for quality reconstruction or the error

inherent structure in a variety of signals relevant to engineering
applications. Hence, this paper proposes a new method of recovery built on
basis pursuit (BP), called Structure-Constrained Basis Pursuit (SCBP), that
constrains signals based on known structure rather than through extra sampling.
Preliminary assessments of this method on TIMIT recordings of the speech
phoneme /aa/ show a substantial decrease in error: with a fixed 5:1 compression
ratio the average recovery error is 23.8% lower versus vanilla BP. More
significantly, this method can be applied to any CS application that samples
structured data, such as FSK waveforms, speech, and tones. In these cases,
higher compression ratios can be reached with comparable error.

a Many-Body-Localization Transition seems sufficiently rich to produce critical
points with level statistics interpolating continuously between the Poisson
statistics of the Localized phase and the Wigner-Dyson statistics of the
Delocalized Phase. In this paper, we consider the strong disorder limit of the
MBL transition, where the critical level statistics is close to the Poisson
statistics. We analyse a one-dimensional quantum spin model, in order to
determine the statistical properties of the rare extensive resonances that are
needed to destabilize the MBL phase. At criticality, we find that the
entanglement entropy can grow with an exponent $0<\alpha < 1$ anywhere between
the area law $\alpha=0$ and the volume law $\alpha=1$, as a function of the
resonances properties, while the entanglement spectrum follows the strong
multifractality statistics. In the MBL phase near criticality, we obtain the
simple value $\nu=1$ for the correlation length exponent. Independently of the
strong disorder limit, we explain why for the Many-Body-Localization transition
concerning individual eigenstates, the correlation length exponent $\nu$ is not
constrained by the usual Harris inequality $\nu \geq 2/d$, so that there is no
theoretical inconsistency with the best numerical measure $\nu = 0.8 (3)$

at the LHC. Both double-parton scattering (DPS) and single-parton scattering
(SPS) contributions are included in the analysis. Each step of DPS is
calculated within $k_t$-factorization approach which effectively includes some
next-to-leading order corrections. The discussed mechanisms unavoidably lead to
the production of pairs of mesons: $D_i D_j$ (each containing $c$ quarks) or
$\bar D_i \bar D_j$ (each containing $\bar c$ antiquarks). We calculate
corresponding differential distribution for $(D^0 D^0$ + $\bar D^0 \bar D^0)$
production. Within large theoretical uncertainties the predicted DPS cross
section is fairly similar to the cross section measured recently by the LHCb
collaboration. We also present first results for the $2 \to 4$ single-parton
scattering $g g \to c \bar c c \bar c$ subprocess for the first time fully
within the $k_t$-factorization approach. In this calculation we have used an
off-shell matrix element squared calculated using recently developed
techniques. The results are compared with our earlier result obtained within
the collinear approach. Only slightly larger cross sections are obtained than
in the case of the collinear approach but still the SPS mechanism contribution
is much smaller than the DPS one. Inclusion of transverse momenta of gluons
entering the hard process leads to a much stronger azimuthal decorrelation
between $c c$ and $\bar c \bar c$ than in the collinear-factorization approach.
A comparison to predictions of double parton scattering (DPS) results and the
LHCb data strongly suggests that the assumption of two fully independent DPS
($g g \to c \bar c \otimes g g \to c \bar c$) may be too approximate.

field lines that globally wrap around an axis. The torus instability model
predicts that a magnetic flux rope of major radius $R$ undergoes an eruption
when its axis reaches a location where the decay index $-d(\ln B_{ex})/d(\ln
R)$ of the ambient magnetic field $B_{ex}$ is larger than a critical value. In
the current-wire model, the critical value depends on the thickness and
time-evolution of the current channel. We use magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations to investigate if the critical value of the decay index at the
onset of the eruption is affected by the magnetic flux rope's internal current
profile and/or by the particular pre-eruptive photospheric dynamics. The
evolution of an asymmetric, bipolar active region is driven by applying
different classes of photospheric motions. We find that the critical value of
the decay index at the onset of the eruption is not significantly affected by
either the pre-eruptive photospheric evolution of the active region or by the
resulting different magnetic flux ropes. As in the case of the current-wire
model, we find that there is a `critical range' $ [1.3-1.5]$, rather than a
`critical value' for the onset of the torus instability. This range is in good
agreement with the predictions of the current-wire model, despite the inclusion
of line-tying effects and the occurrence of tether-cutting magnetic
reconnection.

the exact user location has become a holy grail of almost every service that
lives in the digital world. Starting with the idea of location based services,
nowadays it is not only important to know where users are in real time, but
also to be able predict where they will be in future. Moreover, it is not
enough to know user location in form of latitude longitude coordinates provided
by GPS devices, but also to give a place its meaning (i.e., semantically label
it), in particular detecting the most probable home location for the given
user. The aim of this paper is to provide novel insights on differences among
the ways how different types of human digital trails represent the actual
mobility patterns and therefore the differences between the approaches
interpreting those trails for inferring said patterns. Namely, with the
emergence of different digital sources that provide information about user
mobility, it is of vital importance to fully understand that not all of them
capture exactly the same picture. With that being said, in this paper we start
from an example showing how human mobility patterns described by means of
radius of gyration are different for Flickr social network and dataset of bank
card transactions. Rather than capturing human movements closer to their homes,
Flickr more often reveals people travel mode. Consequently, home location
inferring methods used in both cases cannot be the same. We consider several
methods for home location definition known from the literature and demonstrate
that although for bank card transactions they provide highly consistent
results, home location definition detection methods applied to Flickr dataset
happen to be way more sensitive to the method selected, stressing the paramount
importance of adjusting the method to the specific dataset being used.

forget that the concept of type we understand nowadays is not the same it was
perceived in the sixties. Moreover, we conflate the concept of ""type"" in
programming languages with the concept of the same name in mathematical logic,
an identification that is only the result of the convergence of two different
paths, which started apart with different aims. The paper will present several
remarks (some historical, some of more conceptual character) on the subject, as
a basis for a further investigation. The thesis we will argue is that there are
three different characters at play in programming languages, all of them now
called types: the technical concept used in language design to guide
implementation; the general abstraction mechanism used as a modelling tool; the
classifying tool inherited from mathematical logic. We will suggest three
possible dates ad quem for their presence in the programming language
literature, suggesting that the emergence of the concept of type in computer
science is relatively independent from the logical tradition, until the
Curry-Howard isomorphism will make an explicit bridge between them.

inverse spin-Hall effect and a broadband Fabry-P\'erot resonance. Guided by an

systematic optimization. We find that a 5.8-nm-thick W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer
generates ultrashort pulses fully covering the 1-to-30-THz range. Our novel

displaying many anomalies that still challenge our understanding of such an a
priori simple system. The same is true when looking at nanoconfined water: The
liquid between constituents in a cell is confined to such dimensions, and there
is already evidence that such water can behave very differently from its bulk
counterpart. A striking finding has been reported from computer simulations for
two-dimensionally confined water: The liquid displays continuous or
discontinuous melting depending on its density. In order to understand this
behavior, we have analyzed the melting exhibited by a bilayer of nanoconfined
water by means of molecular dynamics simulations. At high density we observe
the continuous melting to be related to the phase change of the oxygens only,
with the hydrogens remaining liquid-like throughout. Moreover, we find an
intermediate hexatic phase for the oxygens between the liquid and a triangular
solid ice phase, following the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory
for two-dimensional melting. The liquid itself tends to maintain the local
structure of the triangular ice, with its two layers being strongly correlated,
yet with very slow exchange of matter. The decoupling in the behavior of the
oxygens and hydrogens gives rise to a regime in which the complexity of water
seems to disappear, resulting in what resembles a simple monoatomic liquid.
This intrinsic tendency of our simulated water may be useful for understanding
novel behaviors in other confined and interfacial water systems.

asymmetric capacitive couplings, photonic measurements can be used to probe the
finite low frequency admittance of the quantum conductor, the real part of
which being related to the differential conductance. In particular, when the
quantum dot is far from resonance, the charge susceptibility is directly
proportional to the admittance for a large range of frequencies and voltages.
However, when the quantum conductor is near a resonance, such a relation
generally holds only at low frequency and for equal tunnel coupling or low
voltage. Beyond this low-energy near equilibrium regime, the charge
susceptibility and thus the optical transmission offers new insights on the
quantum conductors since the optical observables are not directly connected to
transport quantities. For symmetric lead capacitive couplings, we show that the
optical measurements can be used to reveal the Korringa-Shiba relation,
connecting the reactive to the dissipative part of the susceptibility, at low
frequency and low bias.

reflection of the particle anti-particle content of the theory. This essential

unit volume from the vacuum in a uniform external electric field. The result is
further generalized for arbitrary spin $s$.

  Boucherie","Data retrieval time for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","14 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.SY cs.NI math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of retrieving a reliable estimate of an attribute
monitored by a wireless sensor network, where the sensors harvest energy from
the environment independently, at random. Each sensor stores the harvested
energy in batteries of limited capacity. Moreover, provided they have
sufficient energy, the sensors broadcast their measurements in a decentralized
fashion. Clients arrive at the sensor network according to a Poisson process
and are interested in retrieving a fixed number of sensor measurements, based
on which a reliable estimate is computed. We show that the time until an
arbitrary sensor broadcasts has a phase-type distribution. Based on this result
and the theory of order statistics of phase-type distributions, we determine
the probability distribution of the time needed for a client to retrieve a
reliable estimate of an attribute monitored by the sensor network. We also
provide closed-form expression for the retrieval time of a reliable estimate
when the capacity of the sensor battery or the rate at which energy is
harvested is asymptotically large. In addition, we analyze numerically the
retrieval time of a reliable estimate for various sizes of the sensor network,
maximum capacity of the sensor batteries and rate at which energy is harvested.
These results show that the energy harvesting rate and the broadcasting rate
are the main parameters that influence the retrieval time of a reliable
estimate, while deploying sensors with large batteries does not significantly
reduce the retrieval time.

probability for reaction-diffusion systems in which a first-order catalytic
reaction is performed over active particles. We apply this general method to
systems on metric graphs, which may be viewed as 1-dimensional approximations
of 3-dimensional systems, and obtain explicit formulas for conversion. We then
study numerically a class of 3-dimensional systems and test how accurately they
are described by model formulas obtained for metric graphs. The optimal
arrangement of active particles in a 1-dimensional multiparticle system is
found, which is shown to depend on the level of catalytic activity: conversion
is maximized for low catalytic activity when all particles are bunched together
close to the point of gas injection, and for high catalytic activity when the
particles are evenly spaced.

cells has been explored since 19th century, however, many aspects of mechanisms
underlying the perception of gravity at the molecular level are still not well
known. Perception of gravity in root and shoot gravitropisms is usually
attributed to gravisensitive cells, called statocytes, which exploit
sedimentation of macroscopic and heavy organelles, amyloplasts, to sense the
direction of gravity. Gravity stimulus is then transduced into distal
elongation zone, which is several mm far from statocytes, where it causes
stretching. It is suggested that gravity stimulus is conveyed by gradients in
auxin flux. We propose a theoretical model that may explain how concentration
gradients and/or stretching may indirectly affect the global orientation of
cortical microtubules, attached to the cell membrane and induce their dynamic
reorientation perpendicular to the gradients. In turn, oriented microtubules
arrays direct the growth and orientation of cellulose microfibrils, forming
part of the cell external skeleton and determine the shape of the cell.
Reorientation of microtubules is also observed in reaction to light in
phototropism and mechanical bending, thus suggesting universality of the
proposed mechanism.

gauge groups with N=1 supersymmetry in 3+1 (4D) dimensions. Our system consists
of three multiplets: (i) A super-Yang-Mills vector multiplet (YMVM)
$(A_\mu{}^I, \lambda^I)$, (ii) a dual vector multiplet (DVM) $(B_\mu{}^I,
\chi^I)$, and (iii) an unphysical tensor multiplet (TM) $(C_{\mu\nu}{}^I,
\rho^I, \varphi^I)$, with the index I for adjoint representation. The
multiplets YMVM and DVM are dual to each other like: $G_{\mu\nu}{}^I = (1/2)
\epsilon_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho\sigma} F_{\rho\sigma}{}^I$. The TM is unphysical, but
still plays an important role for establishing the total consistency of the
system, based on recently-developed tensor-hierarchy formulation. We also apply
this technique to non-Abelian electric-magnetic duality in 9+1 (10D)
dimensions. The extra bosonic auxiliary field $K_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_6}$ in 10D is
shown to play an important role for the closure of supersymmetry on fields.
