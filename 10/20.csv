  Matrix for Impulse Noise Removal",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, so called annihilating filer-based low rank Hankel matrix (ALOHA)
approach was proposed as a powerful image inpainting method. Based on the
observation that smoothness or textures within an image patch corresponds to
sparse spectral components in the frequency domain, ALOHA exploits the
existence of annihilating filters and the associated rank-deficient Hankel
matrices in the image domain to estimate the missing pixels. By extending this
idea, here we propose a novel impulse noise removal algorithm using sparse +
low rank decomposition of an annihilating filter-based Hankel matrix. The new
approach, what we call the robust ALOHA, is motivated by the observation that
an image corrupted with impulse noises has intact pixels; so the impulse noises
can be modeled as sparse components, whereas the underlying image can be still
modeled using a low-rank Hankel structured matrix. To solve the sparse + low
rank decomposition problem, we propose an alternating direction method of
multiplier (ADMM) method with initial factorized matrices coming from low rank
matrix fitting (LMaFit) algorithm. To adapt the local image statistics that
have distinct spectral distributions, the robust ALOHA is applied patch by
patch. Experimental results from two types of impulse noises - random valued
impulse noises and salt/pepper noises - for both single channel and
multi-channel color images demonstrate that the robust ALOHA outperforms the
existing algorithms up to 8dB in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio
(PSNR).

$\Theta\sim 1\deg$) and mildly relativistic (bulk velocity $\beta=V_{b}/c\sim
0.03-0.3$). Its X-ray spectrum is found by integrating over thin slices of
constant temperature, radiating in optically thin coronal regime. The
temperature profile along the jet and corresponding differential emission
measure distribution are calculated with full account for gas cooling due to
expansion and radiative losses. Since the model predicts both the spectral
shape and luminosity of the jet's emission, its normalisation is not a free
parameter if the source distance is known. We also explore the possibility of
using simple X-ray observables (such as flux ratios in different energy bands)
to constrain physical parameters of the jet (e.g. gas temperature and density
at its base) without broad-band fitting of high-resolution spectra. We
demonstrate this approach in application to Chandra HETGS spectra of SS 433 in
its 'edge-on' precession phase, when the contribution from non-jet spectral
components is expected to be low. Our model provides a reasonable fit to the
1-3 keV data, while some residuals remain at higher energies, which may be
partially attributed to a putative reflection component. Besides SS 433, the
model might be used for describing jet components in spectra of other Galactic
XRBs (e.g. 4U 1630-47), ULXs (e.g. Holmberg II X-1), and candidate SS 433

important to understand better the accretion process and the evolution of

accounting for up to a third of all traffic on several of the world's most

systems actually cause over and above activity that would have occurred via
other means (e.g., search) if recommendations were absent. Although the ideal
way to estimate the causal impact of recommendations is via randomized
experiments, such experiments are costly and may inconvenience users. In this
paper, therefore, we present a method for estimating causal effects from purely
observational data. Specifically, we show that causal identification through an
instrumental variable is possible when a product experiences an instantaneous
shock in direct traffic and the products recommended next to it do not. We then
apply our method to browsing logs containing anonymized activity for 2.1
million users on Amazon.com over a 9 month period and analyze over 4,000 unique
products that experience such shocks. We find that although recommendation
click-throughs do account for a large fraction of traffic among these products,
at least 75% of this activity would likely occur in the absence of
recommendations. We conclude with a discussion about the assumptions under
which the method is appropriate and caveats around extrapolating results to
other products, sites, or settings.

review in this Report, putting emphasis on theoretical developments. We discuss
the dynamics at the base-pair scale and its pivotal coupling with the polymer
one, with a polymerization index running from a few nucleotides to tens of
kilo-bases. This includes opening and closure of short hairpins and oligomers
as well as zipping and unwinding of long macromolecules. We review how
different physical mechanisms are either used by Nature or utilized in
biotechnological processes to separate the two intertwined DNA strands, by
insisting on quantitative results. They go from thermally-assisted denaturation
bubble nucleation to force- or torque- driven mechanisms. We show that the
helical character of the molecule, possibly supercoiled, can play a key role in
many denaturation and renaturation processes. We categorize the mechanisms
according to the relative timescales associated with base-pairing and chain
degrees of freedom such as bending and torsional elastic ones. In some specific
situations, these chain degrees of freedom can be integrated out, and the
quasi- static approximation is valid. The complex dynamics then reduces to the
diffusion in a low-dimensional free-energy landscape. In contrast, some
important cases of experimental interest necessarily appeal to
far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics.

properties of materials for given parameters, the inverse problem, identifying
which material parameters produce given, desired properties, is only beginning
to be addressed. Recently, several methods have emerged across disciplines that
draw upon optimization and simulation to create computer programs that tailor
material responses to specified behaviors. However, so far the methods
developed either involve black-box techniques, in which the optimizer operates
without explicit knowledge of the material's configuration space, or they
require carefully tuned algorithms with applicability limited to a narrow
subclass of materials. Here we introduce a formalism that can generate
optimizers automatically by extending statistical mechanics into the realm of
design. The strength of this new approach lies in its capability to transform
statistical models that describe materials into optimizers to tailor them. By
comparing against standard black-box optimization methods, we demonstrate how
optimizers generated by this formalism can be faster and more effective, while
remaining straightforward to implement. The scope of our approach includes new
possibilities for solving a variety of complex optimization and design problems
concerning materials both in and out of equilibrium.

baryons ablated from the surface by neutrinos is large and it does not allow
the outflow to achieve a bulk Lorentz factor high enough to produce a GRB; iii)
after the quark burning front reaches the stellar surface, baryon ablation
ceases and the jet becomes too baryon poor to produce a GRB; iv) however,
between these two phases a GRB can be produced over the finite timescale
required for the baryon pollution to cease; a characteristic timescale of the
order of $\sim 0.1 $ s naturally results from the time the conversion front
needs to cover the distance between the rotational pole and the latitude of the
last closed magnetic field line; v) we predict a correlation between the
luminosity of the sGRB and its duration, consistent with the data; vi) our
model also predicts a delay of the order of ten seconds between the time of the
merger event and the sGRB, allowing for the possibility of precursor emission

Minkowski space-time to calculate the energy carried away by gravitational
waves emitted by a time changing mass-quadrupole. However, by now there is
strong observational evidence for a positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$.
To incorporate this fact, Einstein's celebrated derivation is generalized by
replacing Minkowski space-time with de Sitter space-time. The investigation is
motivated by the fact that, because of the significant differences between the
asymptotic structures of Minkowski and de Sitter space-times, many of the
standard techniques, including the standard $1/r$ expansions, can not be used
for $\Lambda >0$. Furthermore since, e.g., the energy carried by gravitational
waves is always positive in Minkowski space-time but can be arbitrarily
negative in de Sitter space-time \emph{irrespective of how small $\Lambda$ is},
the limit $\Lambda\to 0$ can fail to be continuous. Therefore, a priori it is
not clear that a small $\Lambda$ would introduce only negligible corrections to
Einstein's formula. We show that, while even a tiny cosmological constant does
introduce qualitatively new features, in the end, corrections to Einstein's
formula are negligible for astrophysical sources currently under consideration
by gravitational wave observatories.

between capacitance and power delivery. Current efforts to boost the
capacitance of nanoporous supercapacitors focus on reducing the pore size so
that they can only accommodate a single layer of ions. However, this tight
packing compromises the charging dynamics and hence power density. We show via
an analytical theory and Monte Carlo simulations that charging is sensitively
dependent on the affinity of ions to the pores, and that high capacitances can
be obtained for ionophobic pores of widths significantly larger than the ion
diameter. Our theory also predicts that charging can be hysteretic with a
significant energy loss per cycle for intermediate ionophilicities. We use
these observations to explore the parameter regimes in which a
capacitance-power-hysteresis trilemma may be avoided.

(MoM), for the numerical electromagnetic analysis of scattering and radiation
from metallic or dielectric structures, or both structure types in the same
simulation, that are in contact with other metallic or dielectric structures.
The proposed method for solving the MoM junction problem consists of two
separate algorithms, one of which comprises a generalization for bodies in
contact of the surface integral equation (SIE) formulations. Unlike some other
published SIE generalizations in the field of computational electromagnetics,
this generalization does not require duplicating unknowns on the dielectric
separation surfaces. Additionally, this generalization is applicable to any
ordinary single-scatterer SIE formulations employed as baseline. The other
algorithm deals with enforcing boundary conditions and Kirchhoff's Law,
relating the surface current flow across a junction edge. Two important
features inherent to this latter algorithm consist of a mathematically compact
description in matrix form, and, importantly from a software engineering point
of view, an easy implementation in existing MoM codes which makes the debugging
process more comprehensible. A practical example involving a real grounded
monopole antenna for airplane-satellite communication is analyzed for
validation purposes by comparing with precise measurements covering different
electrical sizes.

removed from the RV variations, other significant peaks in the power spectrum

function's power spectrum to begin with. Even when fitting synthetic data with
time sampling identical to the original data, but devoid of any genuine
periodicities close to that of the planet candidate, the original model used to
infer the presence of Alpha Cen Bb leads to identical conclusions: viz., the
3$\sigma$ detection of a half-a-metre-per-second signal with 3.236 day period.
Our analysis underscores the difficulty of detecting weak planetary signals in

of quasinormal resonances. These two families of quasinormal resonances display
qualitatively different asymptotic behaviors in the extremal ($a/M\to 1$)
black-hole limit: The zero-damping modes (ZDMs) are characterized by relaxation
times which tend to infinity in the extremal black-hole limit ($\Im\omega\to 0$
as $a/M\to 1$), whereas the damped modes (DMs) are characterized by non-zero
damping rates ($\Im\omega\to$ finite-values as $a/M\to 1$). In this paper we
refute the claim made by Yang et. al. that co-rotating DMs of near-extremal
black holes are restricted to the limited range $0\leq
\mu\lesssim\mu_{\text{c}}\approx 0.74$, where $\mu\equiv m/l$ is the
dimensionless ratio between the azimuthal harmonic index $m$ and the spheroidal
harmonic index $l$ of the perturbation mode. In particular, we use an
analytical formula originally derived by Detweiler in order to prove the
existence of DMs (damped quasinormal resonances which are characterized by
finite $\Im\omega$ values in the $a/M\to 1$ limit) of near-extremal black holes
in the $\mu>\mu_{\text{c}}$ regime, the regime which was claimed by Yang et.
al. not to contain damped modes. We show that these co-rotating DMs (in the

community as it presents a direct bandgap of ~1.0 eV, shows remarkable

However, a study of the vibrational properties of TiS3, relevant to
understanding the electron-phonon interaction which can be the main mechanism
limiting the charge carrier mobility, is still lacking. In this work, we take
the first steps to study the vibrational properties of TiS3 through temperature
dependent Raman spectroscopy measurements of TiS3 nanoribbons and nanosheets.
Our investigation shows that all the Raman modes linearly soften (red shift) as
the temperature increases from 88 K to 570 K, due to the anharmonic vibrations
of the lattice which also includes contributions from the lattice thermal
expansion. This softening with the temperature of the TiS3 modes is more
pronounced than that observed in other 2D semiconductors such as MoS2, MoSe2,
WSe2 or black phosphorus (BP). This marked temperature dependence of the Raman
could be exploited to determine the temperature of TiS3 nanodevices by using
Raman spectroscopy as a non-invasive and local thermal probe. Interestingly,
the TiS3 nanosheets show a stronger temperature dependence of the Raman modes
than the nanoribbons, which we attribute to a lower interlayer coupling in the
nanosheets.

  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the Hierarchical Gravitational Fragmentation scenario through
numerical simulations of the prestellar stages of the collapse of a marginally
gravitationally unstable isothermal sphere immersed in a strongly
gravitationally unstable, uniform background medium. The core developes a
Bonnor-Ebert (BE)-like density profile, while at the time of singularity (the
protostar) formation the envelope approaches a singular-isothermal-sphere
(SIS)-like $r^-2$ density profile. However, these structures are never
hydrostatic. In this case, the central flat region is characterized by an
infall speed, while the envelope is characterized by a uniform speed. This
implies that the hydrostatic SIS initial condition leading to Shu's classical
inside-out solution is not expected to occur, and therefore neither should the
inside-out solution. Instead, the solution collapses from the outside-in,
naturally explaining the observation of extended infall velocities. The core,
defined by the radius at which it merges with the background, has a
time-variable mass, and evolves along the locus of the ensemble of observed
prestellar cores in a plot of $M/M_{BE}$ vs. $M$, where $M$ is the core's mass
and $M_{BE}$ is the critical Bonnor-Ebert mass, spanning the range from the
""stable"" to the ""unstable"" regimes, even though it is collapsing at all times.
We conclude that the presence of an unstable background allows a core to evolve
dynamically from the time when it first appears, even when it resembles a
pressure-confined, stable BE-sphere. The core can be thought of as a
ram-pressure confined BE-sphere, with an increasing mass due to the accretion
from the unstable background.

large-scale Rossby and Froude numbers, a small vertical to horizontal aspect
ratio, and no bounding horizontal surfaces. Using high-resolution simulations
of the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations and companion integrations of the
balanced quasi-geostrophic equations, we present evidence for a local route to
dissipation of balanced energy directly through interior turbulent cascades.
Analysis of simulations presented in this study suggest that a developing
baroclinic instability can lead to secondary instabilities that can cascade a
small fraction of the energy forward to unbalanced scales. Mesoscale shear and
strain resulting from the hydrostatic geostrophic baroclinic instability drive
frontogenesis. The fronts in turn support ageostrophic secondary circulation
and instabilities. These two processes acting together lead to a quick rise in
dissipation rate which then reaches a peak and begins to fall slowly when
frontogenesis slows down; eventually balanced and imbalanced modes decouple.
Dissipation of balanced energy by imbalanced processes scales exponentially
with Rossby number of the base flow. We expect that this scaling will hold more
generally than for the specific setup we consider given the fundamental nature
of the dynamics involved. A break is seen in the total energy spectrum at small
scales: While a steep $k^{-3}$ geostrophic scaling (where $k$ is the
three-dimensional wavenumber) is seen at intermediate scales, the smaller
scales display a shallower $k^{-5/3}$ scaling, reminiscent of the atmospheric
spectra of Nastrom & Gage. At higher Ro, the vertical shear spectrum has a

moves exists, even in type A, for arbitrary crystal graph intervals. In fact,
it is shown that there are relations of arbitrarily high degree amongst crystal
operators that are not implied by lower degree relations. Second, for crystals
associated to Kac-Moody algebras it is shown for lower intervals that the
Mobius function is always 0, 1, or -1, and in finite type this is also proven
for upper intervals, with a precise formula given in each case. Moreover, the
order complex for each of these intervals is proven to be homotopy equivalent
to a ball or to a sphere of some dimension, despite often not being shellable.
For general intervals, examples are constructed with arbitrarily large Mobius
function, again even in type A. Any interval having Mobius function other than
0, 1, or -1 is shown to contain within it a relation amongst crystal operators
that is not implied by the relations giving rise to the local structure of the
crystal, making precise a tight relationship between the Mobius function and
these somewhat unexpected relations appearing in crystals.
  New properties of the key map are also derived. The key is shown to be
determined entirely by the edge-colored poset-theoretic structure of the
crystal, and a recursive algorithm is given for calculating it.

some of their components are unstable in the temperature and pressure regimes

address the question of the state of matter. In this framework, several works
demonstrated that erosion and redistribution of core materials in the envelope
must be taken into account. These complex mechanisms thus may deeply modify
giant planet interiors for which signatures of strong tidal dissipation have
been obtained for Jupiter and Saturn. The best candidates to explain this
dissipation are the viscoelastic dissipation in the central dense core and
turbulent friction acting on tidal inertial waves in their fluid convective
envelope. In this work, we study the consequences of the possible melting of

For critical infrastructure like power grids, we need to understand their
resilience against large disturbances. Recently, new measures of the resilience
of dynamical systems have been developed in the complex system literature.
Basin stability and survivability respectively assess the asymptotic and
transient behavior of a system when subjected to arbitrary, localized but large
perturbations. To employ these methods to assess the resilience of power grids,
we need to choose a model of the power grid. So far the most popular model that
has been studied is the classical swing equation model for the frequency
response of generators and motors. In this paper we study a more sophisticated
model of synchronous machines that also takes voltage dynamics into account,
and compare it to the previously studied model. This model has been found to
give an accurate picture of the long term evolution of synchronous machines in
the engineering literature for post fault studies. We find evidence that some
stable fix points of the swing equation become unstable when we add voltage
dynamics. If this occurs the asymptotic behavior of the system can be
dramatically altered, and basin stability estimates obtained with the swing
equation can be dramatically wrong. We also find that the survivability does
not change significantly when taking the voltage dynamics into account.
Further, the limit cycle type asymptotic behaviour is strongly correlated with
transient voltages that violate typical operational voltage bounds. Thus,
transient voltage bounds are dominated by transient frequency bounds and play
no large role for realistic parameters.

the routine Talos to derive the quantitative star formation history as a
function of age and metallicity. The star formation history of the Fornax

(>10 Gyr) populations. Cluster Fornax 1,2 and 3 display metallicities as low as
[Fe/H]=-2.5 while Fornax 5 is slightly more metal-rich at [Fe/H]=-1.8,
consistent with resolved and unresolved metallicity tracers. Conversely, Fornax
4 is dominated by a more metal-rich~([Fe/H]=-1.2) and younger population at 10
Gyr, inconsistent with the other clusters. A lack of stellar populations
overlapping with the main body of Fornax argues against the nucleus cluster
scenario for Fornax 4. The combined stellar mass in globular clusters as
derived from the SFH is (9.57$\pm$0.93)$\times$10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ which
corresponds to 2.5$\pm$0.2 percent of the total stellar mass in Fornax. The
mass of the four most metal-poor clusters can be further compared to the
metal-poor Fornax field to yield a mass fraction of 19.6$\pm$3.1 percent.
Therefore, the SFH results provide separate supporting evidence for the
unusually high mass fraction of the GCs compared to the Fornax field
population.

the star formation rate is not. Star formation is regulated by stellar
feedback, keeping the gas out of thermal equilibrium for densities $n <$ 1

of chemical equilibrium throughout the simulation. Star formation is
well-correlated with cold ( T $\leqslant$ 100 K ) gas, but this dense and cold

addition, a significant fraction of H$_2$ resides in a diffuse, warm phase,

the evolution of the size-stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides a
good proxy for the evolution of individual galaxies, the evolution of
individual passive galaxies is not well represented by the observed size - mass
relation due to the evolving number density of passive galaxies. Observations
of z \approx 2 galaxies have revealed an abundance of massive red compact
galaxies, that depletes below z \approx 1. We find that a similar population
forms naturally in the simulation. Comparing these galaxies to their z = 0

high-redshift stars migrating outwards. Approximately 60% of the compact
galaxies increase in size further due to renewed star formation and/or mergers.

controlled by both diffuse HI patches in large-scale bubble morphology and

novel combination of analytic and numerical calculations to three scenarios:
(i) the `bubble' model, where only diffuse HI outside ionized bubbles is
present; (ii) the `web' model, where HI exists only in overdense self-shielded
gas; and (iii) the more realistic 'web-bubble' model, which contains both. Our
analysis confirms that there is a degeneracy between the ionization structure
of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the HI fraction inferred from LyA
surveys, as the three models suppress LyA flux equally with very different HI
fractions. We argue that a joint analysis of the LyA luminosity function and
the rest-frame equivalent width distribution/LyA fraction can break this
degeneracy and provide constraints on the reionization history and its
topology. We further show that constraints can improve if we consider the full
shape of the M_UV-dependent redshift evolution of the LyA fraction of Lyman
break galaxies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) a drop of LyA
fraction larger for UV-faint than for UV-bright galaxies can be reproduced with
web and web-bubble models and therefore does not provide exclusive evidence of
patchy reionization, and (ii) the IGM-transmission PDF is unimodal for bubble
models and bimodal in web models. We further highlight the importance of
galaxy-absorber cross-correlation. Comparing our models to observations, the
neutral fraction at z~7 is likely to be of order of tens of per cent when
interpreted with bubble or web-bubble models. Alternatively, we obtain a
conservative lower limit ~1% in the web models, if we allow for a drop in the
photoionization rate by a factor of ~100 from the post-reionized universe.

delays between the continuum bands as a function of wavelength, extending the
wavelength coverage from 1158\,\AA\ to the $z$ band ($\sim\!9160$\,\AA). We
find that the lags at wavelengths longer than the {\it V} band are equal to or
greater than the lags of high-ionization-state emission lines (such as He\,{\sc
ii}\,$\lambda 1640$ and $\lambda 4686$), suggesting that the continuum-emitting
source is of a physical size comparable to the inner broad-line region (BLR).
The trend of lag with wavelength is broadly consistent with the prediction for
continuum reprocessing by an accretion disk with $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$.
However, the lags also imply a disk radius that is 3 times larger than the
prediction from standard thin-disk theory, assuming that the bolometric
luminosity is 10\% of the Eddington luminosity ($L = 0.1L_{\rm Edd}$). Using
optical spectra from the Large Binocular Telescope, we estimate the bias of the
interband continuum lags due to BLR emission observed in the filters. We find
that the bias for filters with high levels of BLR contamination ($\sim\! 20\%$)
can be important for the shortest continuum lags, and likely has a significant
impact on the {\it u} and {\it U} bands owing to Balmer continuum emission.

resonances of massive scalar fields in their exterior regions. These spatially
regular scalar configurations are characterized by instability timescales which
are much longer than the timescale $M$ set by the geometric size (mass) of the
central black hole. It is well-known that, in the small-mass limit
$\alpha\equiv M\mu\ll1$ (here $\mu$ is the mass of the scalar field), these
quasi-stationary scalar resonances are characterized by the familiar hydrogenic
oscillation spectrum: $\omega_{\text{R}}/\mu=1-\alpha^2/2{\bar n}^2_0$, where
the integer $\bar n_0(l,n;\alpha\to0)=l+n+1$ is the principal quantum number of
the bound-state resonance (here the integers $l=1,2,3,...$ and $n=0,1,2,...$
are the spheroidal harmonic index and the resonance parameter of the field
mode, respectively). As it depends only on the principal resonance parameter
$\bar n_0$, this small-mass ($\alpha\ll1$) hydrogenic spectrum is obviously
degenerate. In this paper we go beyond the small-mass approximation and analyze
the quasi-stationary bound-state resonances of massive scalar fields in
rapidly-spinning Kerr black-hole spacetimes in the regime $\alpha=O(1)$. In
particular, we derive the non-hydrogenic (and, in general, non-degenerate)
resonance oscillation spectrum
${{\omega_{\text{R}}}/{\mu}}=\sqrt{1-(\alpha/{\bar n})^2}$, where $\bar
n(l,n;\alpha)=\sqrt{(l+1/2)^2-2m\alpha+2\alpha^2}+1/2+n$ is the generalized
principal quantum number of the quasi-stationary resonances. This analytically
derived formula for the characteristic oscillation frequencies of the composed
black-hole-massive-scalar-field system is shown to agree with direct numerical
computations of the quasi-stationary bound-state resonances.

feedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives outflows in a
turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). Because the ISM is turbulent, a given
patch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The
high-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and
self-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,
however, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can
self-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the
turbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\gtrsim 0.3$,
the ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is
sufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface
density less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical
time. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\eta \equiv M_{\rm
out}/M_{\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the
circular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for
local self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline
rapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive
winds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that
stellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \lesssim 1$ in
$M_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive
galaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'
those outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,
extended thin stellar disk. We provide simple fitting functions for $\eta$ that
should be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models. [abridged]

matching proxies: the peak halo mass and the peak halo maximal circular
velocity. This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy
luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this
interpolation scheme enables abundance matching models to have adjustable
assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new 400 Mpc/h DarkSky
Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show
that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from
SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence
and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.

that stars and star clusters form preferentially along dense filaments.
Understanding the formation and properties of filaments is therefore a crucial
step in understanding star formation. Here we perform three-dimensional
high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations that follow the evolution of
molecular clouds and the formation of filaments and stars. We apply a filament
detection algorithm and compare simulations with different combinations of
physical ingredients: gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and jet/outflow
feedback. We find that gravity-only simulations produce significantly narrower
filament profiles than observed, while simulations that include turbulence
produce realistic filament properties. For these turbulence simulations, we
find a remarkably universal filament width of 0.10 +/- 0.02 pc, which is
independent of the star formation history of the clouds. We derive a
theoretical model that provides a physical explanation for this characteristic
filament width, based on the sonic scale (lambda_sonic) of molecular cloud
turbulence. Our derivation provides lambda_sonic as a function of the cloud
diameter L, the velocity dispersion sigma_v, the gas sound speed c_s, and the
ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, plasma beta. For typical cloud
conditions in the Milky Way spiral arms, we find lambda_sonic = 0.04-0.16 pc,
in excellent agreement with the filament width of 0.05-0.15 pc from
observations. Consistent with the theoretical model assumptions, we find that
the velocity dispersion inside the filaments is subsonic and supersonic
outside. We further explain the observed p=2 scaling of the filament density
profile, rho ~ r^(-p) with the collision of two planar shocks forming a
filament at their intersection.

update the measurement settings, can greatly increase speed, precision, and
reliability of the characterization of quantum systems. However, decoherence
tends to make adaptive characterization difficult. As an example, we consider
two coupled discrete quantum systems. When one of the systems can be controlled
and measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown
frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements
can provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of
measurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy.
However, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating
between the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi
oscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless
carefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for
efficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We
find, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi
oscillations during its relaxation time $T_1$, $O(10^3)$ measurement shots are
sufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the
unknown frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$ by a factor $O(10^4)$ or larger. We also
develop policies optimized for extreme initial parameter uncertainty and for
the presence of imperfections in the readout.

expected assuming only hot gas in virial equilibrium with the dark matter

uncertainty on this percentage is only statistical and additional systematic
uncertainties enter at the 40 per cent level. The SEDs are dust dominated in
all bands and we consider various models for dust emission. While sufficiently
complex dust models can obviate the SZ effect, the SZ interpretation remains
favoured at the 3$\sigma$-4$\sigma$ level for most models.

These so-called non-global effects are present generically whenever a collider
physics measurement is not explicitly dependent on radiation throughout the
entire phase space. In this paper, we introduce a novel procedure based on
mutual information, which allows us to isolate these non-global correlations
between measurements made in different regions of phase space. We study this
procedure both analytically and in Monte Carlo simulations in the context of
observables measured on hadronic final states produced in $e^+e^-$ collisions,
though it is more widely applicable. The procedure exploits the sensitivity of
soft radiation at large angles to non-global correlations, and we calculate
these correlations through next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The bulk of
these non-global correlations are found to be described in Monte Carlo
simulation. They increase by the inclusion of non-perturbative effects, which
we show can be incorporated in our calculation through the use of a model shape
function. This procedure illuminates the source of non-global correlations and
has connections more broadly to fundamental quantities in quantum field theory.

test empirical relations in extreme conditions with low average gas density and

ultraviolet (XUV) disks, which often contain star forming regions with lower
Halpha-to-far-UV (FUV) flux ratios compared to inner disk star forming regions.
However, most previous studies lack measurements of molecular gas, which is
presumably the component of the interstellar medium out of which stars form. We
analyzed published CO measurements and upper limits for fifteen star forming
regions in the XUV or outer disk of three nearby spiral galaxies and a new CO
upper limit from the IRAM 30 m telescope in one star forming region at r = 3.4
r_25 in the XUV disk of NGC 4625. We found that the star forming regions are in
general consistent with the same molecular-hydrogen Kennicutt-Schmidt law that
applies within the optical radius, independent of whether we used Halpha or FUV
as the star formation rate (SFR) tracer. However, a number of the CO detections
are significantly offset towards higher SFR surface density for their molecular
hydrogen surface density. Deeper CO data may enable us to use the presence or
absence of molecular gas as an evolutionary probe to break the degeneracy
between age and stochastic sampling of the initial mass function as the
explanation for the low Halpha-to-FUV flux ratios in XUV disks.

star-forming and passive galaxies; ii) the intra-cluster light and its
properties; iii) the orbits of low- and high-mass passive galaxies; and iv) the
mass-size relation of ETGs. The stellar mass function of the star-forming
galaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passive
galaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. The color distribution of the
intra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. The
analysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have
tangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size
relation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,
and its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. Low-mass
galaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 Mpc. The ratio
between stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in the
center. The comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profiles
indicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. Our results are
consistent with a scenario in which the ""environmental quenching"" of low-mass
galaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to R200, starvation and
ram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of the
mass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passive
early-types in different regions. Our analyses support the idea that the
intra-cluster light is formed through the tidal disruption of subgiant
galaxies.

compatibility of this duality with time-reversal symmetry. We consider two
theories obtained by coupling a Dirac fermion with an ""inverted"" sign of the
mass $m$ to a $u(1)$ gauge field. Time-reversal in the two theories is
implemented respectively via the $T$ and $CT$ symmetries of the Dirac fermion.
It was recently conjectured (C. Wang and T. Senthil (arXiv:1505.03520), and M.
Metlitski and A.Vishwanath (arXiv:1505.05142)) that in the $|m| \to \infty$
limit these two theories are $S$-dual to each other. We provide support for
this conjecture by studying partition functions of the two theories on
non-orientable manifolds as a way to probe the realization of time-reversal.
Upon integrating out the Dirac fermion, topological terms in the actions of the
two theories are generated. While on an orientable manifold topological terms
in both theories reduce to a $\theta$-term with $\theta = \pi$, on a
non-orientable manifold they are distinct. We explicitly compute partition
functions of the two theories on the manifold $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and show that
they are equal; this result combined with certain physical arguments is
sufficient to establish the duality. The two theories can be viewed as a gauged
topological insulator in class AII and a gauged topological superconductor in
class AIII, and the bulk duality allows us to derive previously conjectured
non-trivial symmetric gapped surface states of these phases.

reproduction rates which are not constant but vary in response to environmental

Interestingly, we find that not only larger growth rates but also reduced
sensitivities to environmental changes substantially increase the fitness.
Thereby, depending on the noise level of the environment, it might be an
evolutionary successful strategy to minimize this sensitivity rather than to
optimize the reproduction speed. Also for neutral evolution, where species with
exactly the same properties compete, variability in the growth rates plays a
crucial role. The time for one species to fixate is strongly reduced in the
presence of environmental noise. Hence, environmental fluctuations constitute a

observable for understanding their origin and the neutral gas reservoirs of
galaxies. While the average colour-excess of DLAs, E(B-V), is known to be <15
milli-magnitudes (mmag), both detections and non-detections with ~2 mmag
precision have been reported. Here we find 3.2-sigma statistical evidence for
DLA dust-reddening of 774 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars by comparing
their fitted spectral slopes to those of ~7000 control quasars. The
corresponding E(B-V) is 3.0 +/- 1.0 mmag, assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC) dust extinction law, and it correlates strongly (3.5-sigma) with the
metal content, characterised by the SiII1526 absorption-line equivalent width,
providing additional confidence that the detection is due to dust in the DLAs.
Evolution of E(B-V) over the redshift range 2.1 < z < 4.0 is limited to <2.5
mmag per unit redshift (1-sigma), consistent with the known, mild DLA
metallicity evolution. There is also no apparent relationship with neutral
hydrogen column density, N(HI), though the data are consistent with a mean
E(B-V)/N(HI) = (3.5 +/- 1.0) x 10^{-24} mag cm^2, approximately the ratio
expected from the SMC scaled to the lower metallicities typical of DLAs. We
implement the SDSS selection algorithm in a portable code to assess the
potential for systematic, redshift-dependent biases stemming from its magnitude
and colour-selection criteria. The effect on the mean E(B-V) is negligible (<5
per cent) over the entire redshift range of interest. Given the broad potential
usefulness of this implementation, we make it publicly available.

merging and accretion of building blocks such as dwarf galaxies and massive
globular clusters. Recently, Deason et al. (2015) suggested that the Milky Way
outer halo formed mostly from big building blocks, such as dwarf spheroidal
galaxies, based on the similar number ratio of blue straggler (BS) stars to
blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars. Here we demonstrate, however, that this
result is seriously biased by not taking into detailed consideration on the
formation mechanism of BHB stars from helium enhanced second-generation
population. In particular, the high BS-to-BHB ratio observed in the outer halo
fields is most likely due to a small number of BHB stars provided by GCs rather
than to a large number of BS stars. This is supported by our dynamical
evolution model of GCs which shows preferential removal of first generation
stars in GCs. Moreover, there are a sufficient number of outer halo GCs which
show very high BS-to-BHB ratio. Therefore, the BS-to-BHB number ratio is not a
good indicator to use in arguing that more massive dwarf galaxies are the main
building blocks of the Milky Way outer halo. Several lines of evidence still
suggest that GCs can contribute a significant fraction of the outer halo stars.

center of two dark matter halos with $M_{\rm halo} \sim4\times10^7 M_\odot$ at
$z>10$ using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We find that
very compact ($\lesssim$ 1 pc) and massive ($\sim6\times10^5 M_\odot$) clusters
form rapidly when pristine gas collapses isothermally with the aid of efficient
Ly$\alpha$ emission during the transition from molecular-cooling halos to
atomic-cooling halos. Because the local free-fall time of dense star-forming
gas is very short ($\ll 1\,{\rm Myr}$), a large fraction of the collapsed gas
is turned into stars before stellar feedback processes blow out the gas and
shut down star formation. Although the early stage of star formation is limited
to a small region of the central star-forming disk, we find that the disk
quickly fragments due to metal enrichment from supernovae. Sub-clusters formed
in the fragmented clouds eventually merge with the main cluster at the center.
The simulated clusters closely resemble the local GCs in mass and size but show
a metallicity spread that is much wider than found in the local GCs. We discuss
a role of pre-enrichment by Pop III and II stars as a potential solution to the
latter issue. Although not without shortcomings, it is encouraging that a naive
blind (not tuned) cosmological simulation presents a possible channel for the
formation of at least some massive GCs.

contribution of the flares. In this paper, we update this correlation with the
data collected until June 2014, expanding the sample size with $\sim$35% more
objects, where the number of short GRBs doubled. With this larger sample we
confirm the existence of a universal correlation that connects the prompt and
afterglow properties of long and short GRBs. We show that this correlation does
not depend on the X-ray light-curve morphology and that further analysis is
necessary to firmly exclude possible biases derived by redshift measurements.
In addition we discuss about the behavior of the peculiar objects as ultra-long
GRBs and we propose the existence of an intermediate group between long and
short GRBs. Interestingly, two GRBs with uncertain classification fall into
this category. Finally, we discuss the physics underlying this correlation, in
the contest of the efficiency of conversion of the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission

proteins. Experimental methods are both expensive and time consuming. In this
thesis I introduce a new machine learning based method to predict the protein
structure. The new method improves the performance from two directions:
creating accurate protein alignments and predicting accurate protein contacts.
First, I present an alignment framework MRFalign which goes beyond
state-of-the-art methods and uses Markov Random Fields to model a protein
family and align two proteins by aligning two MRFs together. Compared to other
methods, that can only model local-range residue correlation, MRFs can model
long-range residue interactions and thus, encodes global information in a
protein. Secondly, I present a Group Graphical Lasso method for contact
prediction that integrates joint multi-family Evolutionary Coupling analysis
and supervised learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence
homologs. Different from single-family EC analysis that uses residue
co-evolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC
analysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target family and its related
families, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds. Our method can
also integrate supervised learning methods to further improve accuracy. We
evaluate the performance of both methods including each of its components on

Cloud of Magellan, the brightest supernova in 400 years. It spurred the
commencement of collaborative research in astrophysics between Japan and New
Zealand that is still ongoing after 25 years. The initial aim of the two
countries was to search for evidence of cosmic rays being emitted by the
supernova in a project named JANZOS. A large cosmic ray detector was installed
near the summit of the Black Birch range in Marlborough to monitor the
supernova but, after seven years of operations, the results proved to be
negative. In 1994 a second phase of research was commenced, this time at the Mt
John University Observatory in Canterbury under the emblem MOA. The aim of the
MOA project is to study dark matter and extrasolar planets using a novel
gravitational microlensing technique. A 1.8m telescope was built at the
observatory, and several planets were subsequently found. Some have exotic
properties, the most exotic being a new class of free-floating planets that
appear not to be orbiting stars. They are estimated to outnumber stars by about
two to one. In this article the work carried out by the JANZOS and MOA
collaborations is reviewed, and plans for the future are outlined.

Saturnian year) means that we have been able to track the seasonal evolution of
atmospheric temperatures, chemistry and cloud opacity over almost every season,
from solstice to solstice and from perihelion to aphelion. Cassini has built
upon the decades-long ground-based record to observe seasonal shifts in
atmospheric temperature, finding a thermal response that lags behind the
seasonal insolation with a lag time that increases with depth into the
atmosphere, in agreement with radiative climate models. Seasonal hemispheric
contrasts are perturbed at smaller scales by atmospheric circulation, such as
belt/zone dynamics, the equatorial oscillations and the polar vortices.
Temperature asymmetries are largest in the middle stratosphere and become
insignificant near the radiative-convective boundary. Cassini has also measured
southern-summertime asymmetries in atmospheric composition, including ammonia
(the key species for the topmost clouds), phosphine and para-hydrogen (both
disequilibrium species) in the upper troposphere; and hydrocarbons deriving
from the UV photolysis of methane in the stratosphere (principally ethane and
acetylene). These chemical asymmetries are now altering in subtle ways due to
(i) the changing chemical efficiencies with temperature and insolation; and
(ii) vertical motions associated with large-scale overturning in response to
the seasonal temperature contrasts. Similarly, hemispheric contrasts in
tropospheric aerosol opacity and coloration that were identified during the
earliest phases of Cassini's exploration have now reversed, suggesting an
intricate link between the clouds and the temperatures. [Abridged]

the simplifying assumptions made in analytical models. In particular, we
investigate feedback emanating from multiple stellar sources rather than from a
single source, as is usually assumed, and show that collisions betweens shells
of gas swept up by feedback leads to momentum cancellation and the formation of
high density clumps and filaments. This high density material is resistant both
to expulsion from the galaxy potential and to disruption by feedback; if it
falls back onto the NC, we expect the gas to be available for further star
formation or for feeding a central black hole. We also note our results may
have implications for the evolution of globular clusters and stellar clusters
in high redshift dark matter halos.

based on the similarity between them and neurons (specifically synapses and ion
pumps). The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a
short-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term
memory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate
the physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of
these current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing
returns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to
implement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential
logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full
Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's
short-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the
carry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also
outputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not
physically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port
with an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to
unexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's
slow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large
computation with such slow operations speeds. We propose that using spiking
logic, either in gates or as neuron-analogues, with plastic rewritable
connections between them, would allow the building of a neuromorphic computer.

The $rms$ of the intensity among the 25 PACS spaxels of a given pointing is
typically less than one third of the mean intensity, showing that the emission
is extended. [NII] is produced in gas in which hydrogen is ionized, and
collisional excitation is by electrons. The ratio of the two fine structure
transitions provides a direct measurement of the electron density, yielding
$n(e)$ largely in the range 10 to 50 cm$^{-3}$ with an average value of 29

emission is highly correlated with that of [CII], and we calculate that between

relatively high electron densities indicate that the source of the [NII]

necessary to populate the inner stellar halo. We also find that the accretion
rate of the galaxy from the stream alone underestimates the accretion rate

that is optimized for $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ measurements. It uses the upgraded NuMI
beam from Fermilab and measures electron-neutrino appearance and muon-neutrino
disappearance at its Far Detector in Ash River, Minnesota. The $\nu_e$
appearance analysis at NOvA aims to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy problem
and to constrain the CP-violating phase. The first data set of
$2.74\times10^{20}$ protons on target (POT) equivalent exposure taken by NOvA
has been analyzed. The first measurement of electron-neutrino appearance in
NOvA provides solid evidence of $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ oscillation with the NuMI
beam line. Electron-neutrino identification is the key ingredient for the
$\nu_e$ appearance analysis. The electron-identification algorithm used to
produce the primary results presented here compares 3-D shower-energy profiles
with Monte Carlo prototypes to construct likelihoods for each particle
hypothesis. Particle likelihoods, among other event-topology variables, are
used as inputs to an Artificial Neural Network for the final electron-neutrino
identification. The design and implementation of this algorithm is also
presented.

the cross-channels have arbitrary rank constraints, and the $k^{th}$

consolidates and significantly generalizes results from prior studies by
Krishnamurthy et al., of rank-deficient interference channels where all users

the $k^{th}$ user pair has $M_k$ antennas. The broader outcome of this work is
a novel class of replication-based outer bounds for arbitrary rank-constrained

auxiliary users and the network connectivity is chosen to ensure that any
achievable scheme for the original network also works in the new network. The
replicated network creates a new perspective of the problem, so that even
simple arguments such as user cooperation become quite powerful when applied in
the replicated network, giving rise to stronger outer bounds, than when applied
directly in the original network. Remarkably, the replication based bounds are
broadly applicable not only to MIMO interference channels with arbitrary

minimal actions of a free group on trees, up to scaling (also known as Outer
Space), embeds in infinite projective space via the map sending an action to
its projectivized length function. They also proved that the image of this map
has compact closure.
  For a right-angled Artin group whose defining graph is connected and
triangle-free, we investigate the space of minimal actions on 2-dimensional
CAT(0) rectangle complexes. Charney and Margolis showed that such actions are
completely determined by their length functions; hence this space embeds in
infinite projective space. Here it is shown that the image of the embedding

actions, has compact closure.

results in the three-peak structure of the spectral functions of peripheral

just-in-time via photonic subtraction, addition or replacement from incoming
Gaussian states - the entanglement-generation rate between stations via
non-Gaussian state transfer will be substantially less than that created by

quantum memory in altering this conclusion is discussed, and comparison with
entanglement rates produced via single-photon technologies is provided. Our
results suggest that in the near term entangled Gaussian states, squeezed

inhomogeneity takes place in a layer of arbitrary width and in arbitrary form.
The physical relevance of the solutions to the DRs is demonstrated by the
corresponding time-dependent computations. For all profiles examined, the
lowest-order kink modes are trapped regardless of longitudinal wavenumber $k$.
A continuous density distribution introduces a difference to their periods of
$\lesssim 13\%$ when $k$ is the observed range, relative to the case where the
density profile takes a step-function form. Sausage modes and other branches of
kink modes are leaky at small $k$, and their periods and damping times are
heavily influenced by how the transverse density profile is prescribed, the
lengthscale in particular. These modes have sufficiently high quality to be
observable only for physical parameters representative of flare loops. We
conclude that while the simpler DR pertinent to a step-function profile can be
used for the lowest-order kink modes, the detailed information on the
transverse density structuring needs to be incorporated into studies of sausage
modes and higher-order kink modes.

extragalactic astronomy, on a time scale that is short compared to a human
lifetime. In order to take advantage of this event, we produced seven
gravitational lens models with five independent methods, based on Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) Hubble Frontier Field images, along with extensive
spectroscopic follow-up observations by HST, the Very Large and the Keck
Telescopes. We compare the model predictions and show that they agree
reasonably well with the measured time delays and magnification ratios between
the known images, even though these quantities were not used as input. This
agreement is encouraging, considering that the models only provide statistical
uncertainties, and do not include additional sources of uncertainties such as
structure along the line of sight, cosmology, and the mass sheet degeneracy. We
then present the model predictions for the other appearances of SN ""Refsdal."" A
future image will reach its peak in the first half of 2016, while another image
appeared between 1994 and 2004. The past image would have been too faint to be
detected in existing archival images. The future image should be approximately
one third as bright as the brightest known image (i.e., H_AB~25.7 mag at peak
and H_AB~26.7 mag six months before peak), and thus detectable in single-orbit
HST images. We will find out soon whether our predictions are correct.

require the solution of the compressible Euler equations. The acoustic
time-scale is significantly faster than the advective scale, yet it is
typically not relevant to atmospheric and weather phenomena. The acoustic and
advective components of the hyperbolic flux are separated in the characteristic
space. High-order, conservative additive Runge-Kutta methods are applied to the
partitioned equations so that the acoustic component is integrated in time
implicitly with an unconditionally stable method, while the advective component
is integrated explicitly. The time step of the overall algorithm is thus
determined by the advective scale. Benchmark flow problems are used to
demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and convergence of the proposed algorithm.
The computational cost of the partitioned semi-implicit approach is compared
with that of explicit time integration.

Non-Born-Oppenheimer electron-nuclear interactions in molecules, electron-hole

quantum mechanical formalism. The central challenge in the theoretical
treatment of multicomponent systems is capturing the many-body correlation
effects that exist not only between particles of identical types

(electron-nuclear and electron-hole). In this work, the development and
implementation of multicomponent coupled-cluster (mcCC) theory for treating
particle-particle correlation in multicomponent systems is presented. This
method provides a balanced treatment of many-particle correlation in a general
multicomponent system while maintaining a size-consistent and size-extensive
formalism. The coupled-cluster ansatz presented here is the extension of the
electronic structure CCSD formulation for multicomponent systems and is defined
as $\vert \Psi_\mathrm{mcCC} \rangle =

demonstrated by computing biexciton binding energies for multiexcitonic systems

capturing electron-hole correlation in multiexcitonic systems.

arbitrary mixed states. Compared with some present methods, the approach based
on trace distance can provide an optimal bound to the speed of the evolution.
The dynamical transition from no speed-up region to speed-up region takes on in
the spontaneous decay of an two-level atom with detuning. The evolution is
characteristic of the alternating behavior between quantum speed-up and
speed-down in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime. Under the
off-resonance condition, the dynamical evolution can be accelerated for short
previous times and then decelerated to a normal process either in the weak or
strong coupling regime. From the time-energy uncertainty relation, we
demonstrate that the potential capacity for quantum speed-up evolution is
closely related to the energy flow-back from the reservoir to the system. The
negative decay rate for short time intervals leads to the speed-up process
where the photons previously emitted by the atom are reabsorbed at a later
time. The values of the spontaneous decay rate becomes positive after a long
enough time, which results in the normal evolution with no speed-up potential.

quantitative objectives that restrict the consumption of a resource modeled by
the weights, e.g., a battery that is charged and drained. Typically, upper
and/or lower bounds on the battery capacity are part of the problem
description. Here, we consider the problem of determining upper bounds on the
average accumulated energy or on the capacity while satisfying a given lower
bound, i.e., we do not determine whether a given bound is sufficient to meet
the specification, but if there exists a sufficient bound to meet it.
  In the classical setting with positive and negative weights, we show that the
problem of determining the existence of a sufficient bound on the long-run
average accumulated energy can be solved in doubly-exponential time. Then, we
consider recharge games: here, all weights are negative, but there are recharge
edges that recharge the energy to some fixed capacity. We show that bounding
the long-run average energy in such games is complete for exponential time.
Then, we consider the existential version of the problem, which turns out to be
solvable in polynomial time: here, we ask whether there is a recharge capacity
that allows the system player to win the game.
  We conclude by studying tradeoffs between the memory needed to implement
strategies and the bounds they realize. We give an example showing that memory
can be traded for bounds and vice versa. Also, we show that increasing the
capacity allows to lower the average accumulated energy.

of strongly coupled critical fields with a dynamical scaling $z$ are studied by
employing the holographic approach. The corresponding dual description is the
string moving in the 4+1-dimensional Lifshitz geometry. The squeezed vacuum
state is constructed from the Bogoliubov transformations of the creation and
annihilation operators of the pure vacuum state as a result from the perturbed
geometry. Then the influence on particle's velocity dispersion from the
squeezed vacuum is studied. With appropriate choices of squeezing parameters,
the velocity dispersion is found smaller than the value caused by the normal
vacuum fluctuations. This leads to a subvacuum effect. We find that the
reduction in the velocity dispersion is suppressed by a large coupling constant
of quantum critical fields, but is in principle observable. We then investigate
the effect of the squeezed vacuum to the decoherence dynamics of a quantum
particle. It is found possible for this decoherence to be below the level from
the pure vacuum, rendering another subvacuum phenomenon of recoherence. We make
some estimates of the degree of recoherence, and show that, in contrary to the
velocity dispersion, the recoherence effect is proportional to the large
coupling constant, and can potentially be observed. Finally we make a
comparison with the effect on the particle influenced by a relativistic free
field with the dynamical scaling $z=1$.

There is also considerable interest in the origins of life-forming and
life-sustaining molecules on Earth. Here, we perform reactive molecular
dynamics simulations to probe the formation of carbon-rich molecules and
clusters on carbonaceous surfaces resembling dust grains and meteoroids. Our
results show that large chains form on graphitic surfaces at low temperatures
(100K - 500K) and smaller fullerene-like molecules form at higher temperatures
(2000K - 3000K). The formation is faster on the surface than in the gas at low
temperatures but slower at high temperatures as surface interactions prevent
small clusters from coagulation. We find that for efficient formation of
molecular complexity, mobility about the surface is important and helps to
build larger carbon chains on the surface than in the gas phase at low

optimum composition (fraction of positively charged particles) required for the
stabilization corresponds to a minimum in the interaction energy per particle.
In addition, for each charge ratio, there is a range of compositions where

pattern formation at the emulsion interface is strongly influenced by the
charge ratio. We find well-mixed isotropic, square and hexagonal arrangement of

reorganization of their internal structures. While direct evidences for
entanglements have not been observed in the long ring polymers unlike linear
polymer melts, threading between the rings is suspected to be the main reason
for slowing down of ring polymer diffusion. It is, however, difficult to define
the threading configuration between two rings because the rings have no chain
end. In this work, evidences for threading dynamics of ring polymers are
presented by using molecular dynamics simulation and applying a novel analysis
method. The simulation results are analyzed in terms of the statistics of
persistence and exchange times that have proved useful in studying
heterogeneous dynamics of glassy systems. We find that the threading time of
ring polymer melts increases more rapidly with the degree of polymerization
than that of linear polymer melts. This indicates that threaded ring polymers
cannot diffuse until unthreading event occurs, which results in the slowing
down of ring polymer diffusion.

demonstrates a specific $q$-dependence varying as $q^{-3}$ at low wavevectors

nanoribbons (GNRs) is calculated with the three-phonon umklapp, SW and rough

Mermin and H. Wagner is caused by long wavelength density fluctuations. Those

one: They cause the Lindemann criterion to fail in 2D and the mean squared
displacement not to be limited. Comparing experimental data from 3D and 2D
amorphous solids with 2D crystals we disentangle Mermin-Wagner fluctuations

the problem of microgrid analysis and control. The starting point is an energy
function comprising the kinetic energy associated with the elements that
emulate the rotating machinery and terms taking into account the reactive power
stored in the lines and dissipated on shunt elements. We then shape this energy
function with the addition of an adjustable voltage-dependent term, and
construct incremental storage functions satisfying suitable dissipation
inequalities. Our choice of the voltage-dependent term depends on the voltage
dynamics/controller under investigation. Several microgrids dynamics that have
similarities or coincide with dynamics already considered in the literature are
captured in our incremental energy analysis framework. The twist with respect
to existing results is that our incremental storage functions allow for a large
signal analysis of the coupled microgrid obviating the need for simplifying
linearization techniques and for the restrictive decoupling assumption in which
the frequency dynamics is fully separated from the voltage one. A complete
Lyapunov stability analysis of the various systems is carried out along with a

harmonics instead of spherical harmonics. This indicates that the bound state
experiences a gauge field identical to a magnetic monopole at the center of the
sphere, with the monopole charge equal to the quantized relative angular
momentum of this bound state. We show that this emergent gauge field is due to
the coupling between the center-of-mass and the relative motion on curved

the emergent magnetic field is exactly the local Gaussian curvature. This

approach to extract the neutron electric dipole moment is based on the
calculation of the $CP$-odd electromagnetic form factor $F_3(Q^2)$ for small
values of the vacuum angle $\theta$ in the limit of zero Euclidean momentum
transfer $Q^2$. The limit $Q^2 \to 0$ is realized either by adopting a
parameterization of the momentum dependence of $F_3(Q^2)$ and performing a fit,
or by employing new position space methods, which involve the elimination of
the kinematical momentum factor in front of $F_3(Q^2)$. The computation in the
presence of a $CP$-violating term requires the evaluation of the topological
charge ${\cal Q}$. This is computed by applying the cooling technique and the
gradient flow with three different actions, namely the Wilson, the Symanzik
tree-level improved and the Iwasaki action. We demonstrate that cooling and

  Cryptography Blind Digital Signature Algorithm","17 pages, 6 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To strengthen the anonymity of Bitcoin, several centralized coin-mixing
providers (mixers) such as BitcoinFog.com, BitLaundry.com, and Blockchain.info
assist users to mix Bitcoins through CoinJoin transactions with multiple inputs
and multiple outputs to uncover the relationship between them. However, these
mixers know the output address of each user, such that they cannot provide true
anonymity. This paper proposes a centralized coin-mixing algorithm based on an
elliptic curve blind signature scheme (denoted as Blind-Mixing) that obstructs
mixers from linking an input address with an output address. Comparisons among
three blind signature based algorithms, Blind-Mixing, BlindCoin, and RSA
Coin-Mixing, are conducted. It is determined that BlindCoin may be deanonymized
because of its use of a public log. In RSA Coin-Mixing, a user's Bitcoins may
be falsely claimed by another. In addition, the blind signature scheme of
Blind-Mixing executes 10.5 times faster than that of RSA Coin-Mixing.

symmetric primitives seem less vulnerable against quantum computing: the main
known applicable result is Grover's algorithm that gives a quadratic speed-up

  In this work, we examine more closely the security of symmetric ciphers
against quantum attacks. Since our trust in symmetric ciphers relies mostly on
their ability to resist cryptanalysis techniques, we investigate quantum
cryptanalysis techniques. More specifically, we consider quantum versions of
differential and linear cryptanalysis. We show that it is usually possible to
use quantum computations to obtain a quadratic speed-up for these attack
techniques, but the situation must be nuanced: we don't get a quadratic
speed-up for all variants of the attacks. This allows us to demonstrate the
following non-intuitive result: the best attack in the classical world does not
necessarily lead to the best quantum one. We give some examples of application
on ciphers LAC and KLEIN. We also discuss the important difference between an
adversary that can only perform quantum computations, and an adversary that can

(010) has been investigated using temperature-programmed desorption. The effect
of defects on the desorption process has been probed by the use of a rough cut
forsterite surface prepared from the cleaved forsterite sample. Several
approaches have been used to extract the desorption energy and pre-exponential
factor describing the desorption kinetics. In the sub-monolayer coverage
regime, the NH$_3$ desorption shows a broad distribution of desorption
energies, indicating the presence of different adsorption sites, which results
in an apparent coverage-dependent desorption energy. This distribution is
sensitive to the surface roughness with the cut forsterite surface displaying a
significantly broader distribution of desorption energies compared to the
cleaved forsterite surface. The cut forsterite surface exhibits sites with
desorption energies up to 62.5 kJ mol$^{-1} $ in comparison to a desorption
energy of up to 58.0 kJ mol$^{-1} $ for the cleaved surface. Multilayer
desorption is independent of the nature of the forsterite surface used, with a
desorption energy of ($25.8\pm0.9$) kJ mol$^{-1} $. On astrophysically relevant
heating time-scales, the presence of a coverage dependent desorption energy
distribution results in a lengthening of the NH$_3$ desorption time-scale by
$5.9\times 10^4$ yr compared to that expected for a single desorption energy.
In addition, the presence of a larger number of high-energy adsorption sites on
the rougher cut forsterite surface leads to a further lengthening of ca. 7000
yr.

used to monitor the radial velocity of 13 low-metallicity carbon stars, among
which 7 Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars and 6 CH stars. All stars but
one show clear evidence for binarity. New orbits are obtained for 8 systems.
The sample covers an extended range in orbital periods, extending from 3.4 d
(for the dwarf carbon star HE 0024-2523) to about 54 yr (for the CH star HD 26,
the longest known among barium, CH and extrinsic S stars). Three systems
exhibit low-amplitude velocity variations with periods close to 1 yr
superimposed on a long-term trend. In the absence of an accurate photometric
monitoring of these systems, it is not clear yet whether these variations are
the signature of a very low-mass companion, or of regular envelope pulsations.
The period - eccentricity (P - e) diagram for the 40 low-metallicity carbon
stars with orbits now available shows no difference between CH and CEMP-s stars
(the latter corresponding to those CEMP stars enriched in s-process elements,
as are CH stars). We suggest that they must be considered as one and the same
family and that their different names only stem from historical reasons.
Indeed, these two families have as well very similar mass-function
distributions, corresponding to companions with masses in the range 0.5 - 0.7
Msun, indicative of white-dwarf companions, adopting 0.8 - 0.9 Msun for the
primary component. This result confirms that CH and CEMP-s stars obey the same
mass-transfer scenario as their higher-metallicity analogs, the barium stars.
The P - e diagrams of barium, CH and CEMP-s stars are indeed very similar. They
reveal two different groups of systems: one with short orbital periods (P <
1000 d) and mostly circular or almost circular orbits, and another with
longer-period and eccentric (e > 0.1) orbits.

additionally, the cell cycle generically influences circadian clocks in a
non-specific fashion: The regular, discrete jumps in gene-copy number arising
from DNA replication during the cell cycle cause a periodic driving of the
circadian clock, which can dramatically alter its behavior and impair its
function. A clock built on negative transcriptional feedback either phase locks
to the cell cycle, so that the clock period tracks the cell division time, or
exhibits erratic behavior. We argue that the cyanobacterium Synechococcus

disturbances, both of which are needed to fully insulate it from the cell cycle
and give it its observed robustness: a phosphorylation-based protein
modification oscillator, together with its accompanying push-pull read-out
circuit that responds primarily to the ratios of the different phosphoforms,
makes the clock less susceptible to perturbations in protein synthesis; and the
presence of multiple, asynchronously replicating copies of the same chromosome
diminishes the effect of replicating any single copy of a gene.

introduce a notion of differential, called Carnot differential, for Carnot
manifolds maps (i.e., maps that are compatible with the Carnot manifold
structure). This differential is obtained as a group map between the
corresponding tangent groups. We prove that, at every point, a Carnot manifold
map is osculated in a very precise way by its Carnot differential at the point.
We also show that, in the case of maps between nilpotent graded groups, the
Carnot differential is given by the Pansu derivative. Therefore, the Carnot
differential is the natural generalization of the Pansu derivative to maps
between general Carnot manifolds. Another main result is a construction of an
analogue for Carnot manifolds of Connes' tangent groupoid. Given any Carnot
manifold $(M,H)$ we get a smooth groupoid that encodes the smooth deformation
of the pair $M\times M$ to the tangent group bundle $GM$. This shows that, at
every point, the tangent group is the tangent space in a true
differential-geometric fashion. Moreover, the very fact that we have a groupoid
accounts for the group structure of the tangent group. Incidentally, this
answers a well-known question of Bella\""iche.

roughly zero (slight positive gain). We also consider the effect of not having

  Let $\gamma^k_i$ be the circulation of $u_0^k$ around the circle
$\{|x-z^k_i|=\varepsilon_k\}$. We prove that the homogenization limit retains
information on the circulations as a time-independent coefficient. More
precisely, we assume that: (1) $\omega_0^k = \mbox{ curl }u_0^k$ has a uniform
compact support and converges weakly in $L^{p_0}$, for some $p_0>2$, to
$\omega_0 \in L^{p_0}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, (2) $\sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \gamma^k_i

a weak solution $u$ of a modified Euler system in the full plane. This modified
Euler system is given, in vorticity formulation, by an active scalar transport
equation for the quantity $\omega=\mbox{ curl } u$, with initial data

to a fluctuating activation free energy. We include a Maxwellian elastic term
and assume that the corresponding shear modulus fluctuates as well with the
same distribution as that of the activation barriers. The model is solved in
coherent-potential approximation (CPA), for which a derivation is given. The
theory predicts an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the viscosity in
the vanishing-frequency limit, independent of the distribution of the
activation barriers. The theory implies that this activation energy is
generally different from that of a diffusing particle with the same
barrier-height distribution. If the distribution of activation barriers is
assumed to have Gaussian form, the finite-frequency version of the theory
describes well the typical low-temperature alpha relaxation peak of glasses.
Beta relaxation can be included by adding another Gaussian with center at much
lower energies than that responsible for the alpha relaxation. At high
frequencies our theory reduces to the description of an elastic medium with
spatially fluctuating elastic moduli (heterogeneous elasticity theory), which

large set of Cassini data, we determine Saturn's tidal parameters through their
current effects on the orbits of the eight main and four coorbital moons. We
have used the latter to make the first determination of Saturn's Love number,
$k_2=0.390 \pm 0.024$, a value larger than the commonly used theoretical value
of 0.341 (Gavrilov & Zharkov, 1977), but compatible with more recent models
(Helled & Guillot, 2013) for which $k_2$ ranges from 0.355 to 0.382. Depending
on the assumed spin for Saturn's interior, the new constraint can lead to a
reduction of up to 80% in the number of potential models, offering great
opportunities to probe the planet's interior. In addition, significant tidal
dissipation within Saturn is confirmed (Lainey et al., 2012) corresponding to a
high present-day tidal ratio $k_2/Q=(1.59 \pm 0.74) \times 10^{-4}$ and
implying fast orbital expansions of the moons. This high dissipation, with no
obvious variations for tidal frequencies corresponding to those of Enceladus
and Dione, may be explained by viscous friction in a solid core, implying a
core viscosity typically ranging between $10^{14}$ and $10^{16}$ Pa.s (Remus et
al., 2012). However, a dissipation increase by one order of magnitude at Rhea's
frequency could suggest the existence of an additional, frequency-dependent,
dissipation process, possibly from turbulent friction acting on tidal waves in
the fluid envelope of Saturn (Ogilvie & Li, 2004). Alternatively, a few of
Saturn's moons might themselves experience large tidal dissipation.

TMD PDFs (or in short TMDs) include spin-momentum correlations, including also
time-reversal-odd (T-odd) correlations. The latter are important in the
description of single spin asymmetries. In this way TMDs open up new ways of
studying the spin structure of hadrons or they can be used as tools that
incorporate hadronic structure also in non-collinear situations. The operator
structure of TMDs within QCD, in particular the structure of Wilson lines, is
more complex than that for collinear functions leading to various ways of
breaking of universality. This breaking of universality, however, can be

dust properties can be studied with their driving gases, measured
simultaneously with the same instrument or contemporaneously with another.

signatures composing an hyperspectral image and their relative abundance
fractions in each pixel. In practice, the identified signatures may vary
spectrally from an image to another due to varying acquisition conditions, thus
inducing possibly significant estimation errors. Against this background,
hyperspectral unmixing of several images acquired over the same area is of
considerable interest. Indeed, such an analysis enables the endmembers of the
scene to be tracked and the corresponding endmember variability to be
characterized. Sequential endmember estimation from a set of hyperspectral
images is expected to provide improved performance when compared to methods
analyzing the images independently. However, the significant size of
hyperspectral data precludes the use of batch procedures to jointly estimate
the mixture parameters of a sequence of hyperspectral images. Provided that
each elementary component is present in at least one image of the sequence, we
propose to perform an online hyperspectral unmixing accounting for temporal
endmember variability. The online hyperspectral unmixing is formulated as a
two-stage stochastic program, which can be solved using a stochastic
approximation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic
and real data. A comparison with independent unmixing algorithms finally
illustrates the interest of the proposed strategy.

information technologies. While remarkable progress has been made on single
photons and photon pairs, multipartite correlated photon states are usually
produced in purely optical systems by post-selection or cascading, with
extremely low efficiency and exponentially poor scaling. Multipartite states
enable improved tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics as well as
implementations of complex quantum optical networks and protocols. It would be
favorable to directly generate these states using solid state systems, for
better scaling, simpler handling, and the promise of reversible transfer of
quantum information between stationary and flying qubits. Here we use the
ground states of two optically active coupled quantum dots to directly produce
photon triplets. The wavefunctions of photogenerated excitons localized in
these ground states are correlated via molecular hybridization and Coulomb
interactions. The formation of a triexciton leads to a triple cascade
recombination and sequential emission of three photons with strong
correlations. The quantum dot molecule is embedded in an epitaxially grown
nanowire engineered for single-mode waveguiding and improved extraction
efficiency at the emission wavelength. We record 65.62 photon triplets per
minute, surpassing rates of all earlier reported sources, in spite of the
moderate efficiency of our detectors. Our structure and data represent a
breakthrough towards implementing multipartite photon entanglement and
multi-qubit readout schemes in solid state devices, suitable for integrated
quantum information processing.

pollution by mass transfer from a companion formerly on the thermally-pulsing

investigates the relationship between the s-process enrichment in the barium
star and the mass of its WD companion. It is expected that helium WDs, which
have masses smaller than about 0.5 Msun and never reached the AGB phase, should
not pollute with s-process elements their giant companion, which should thus
never turn into a barium star. Spectra with a resolution of R ~ 86000 were
obtained with the HERMES spectrograph on the 1.2-m Mercator telescope for a
sample of 11 binary systems involving WD companions of various masses. We use
standard 1D LTE MARCS model atmospheres coupled with the Turbospectrum
radiative-transfer code to derive the atmospheric parameters using equivalent
widths of FeI and Fe II lines. The abundances of s-process elements for the
entire sample of 11 binary stars were derived homogeneously. The sample
encompasses all levels of overabundances: from solar [s/Fe]=0 to 1.5 dex in the
2 binary systems with S-star primaries (for which dedicated MARCS model
atmospheres were used). The primary components of binary systems with a WD more
massive than 0.5 Msun are enriched in s-process elements. We also found a trend
of increasing [s/Fe] with [C/Fe] or [(C+N)/Fe]. Our results conform to the
expectation that binary systems with WD companions less massive than 0.5 Msun
do not host barium stars.

of the of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offer a powerful probe of
the physics of the early universe. In recent works a statistical procedure
based upon the calculation of the kurtosis and skewness of the data in patches
of CMB sky-sphere has been proposed and used to investigate the large-angle
deviation from Gaussianity in WMAP maps. Here we briefly address the question
as to how this analysis of Gaussianity is modified if the foreground-cleaned
Planck maps are considered. We show that although the foreground-cleaned Planck
maps present significant deviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when a
less severe mask is used, they become consistent with Gaussianity, as detected
by our indicators, when masked with the union mask U73.

surface axial anisotropy tends to align spins along the surface [111] normal

confinement is predicted to persist independently of the length of the

Monte-Carlo simulations on a lattice. SUSY is, however, broken on the lattice

compactified N=1 SYM theory with periodic fermion boundary conditions
corresponds to the Witten index. Therefore it can be used to test whether
supersymmetry is realized on the lattice. Results of our recent numerical

  Purpose: In this work we study the domain of applicability of microscopic
two-body chiral potentials in the construction of an optical potential.
  Methods: We basically follow the KMT approach to build a microscopic complex
optical potential and then we perform some test calculations on 16O at
different energies.
  Results: Our conclusion is that a particular set of potentials with a
Lippmann-Schwinger cutoff at relatively high energies (above 500 MeV) has the
best performances reproducing the scattering observables.
  Conclusions: Our work shows that building an optical potential within Chiral
Perturbation Theory is a promising approach to the description of elastic
proton scattering, in particular, in view of the future inclusion of many-body
forces that naturally arise in such framework.

Parity-odd extra vector multiplet $(B_\mu{}^I, \chi^I)$, and (iii) Scalar
multiplet $(C^I, \rho^I, f^I)$. The bosonic fields in these multiplets are the
same as the original JP-model, except for the auxiliary field $~f^I$ which is
new, while the fermions $\lambda^I, \chi^I$ and $\rho^I$ are their

of the kinetic term for $C^I$ with its modified field-strength $H_\mu{}^I
\equiv D_\mu C^I + m B_\mu{}^I$. The inclusion of the $C^I$-kinetic term is to
comply with the recently-developed tensor hierarchy formulation for
supersymmetrization.

both with the microwave power and the tunneling current. However, this
variation is not monotonous, but staircase-like. The phenomenon is caused by
mutual locking of positive and negative step series. A similar locking is
observed with Shapiro steps. As a result the superconducting gap assumes
quantized values equal to multiples of the quarter of the photon energy. The
quantization is a manifestation of nonequilibrium tuning (suppression or
enhancement) of superconductivity by the microwave field.

  ALICE detector","PhD thesis, Universita\^a degli Studi di Torino",,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main goal of the experimental programs on ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions at the LHC is the production and characterization of the Quark Gluon
Plasma (QGP), a phase of nuclear matter in which strongly interacting
constituents (quarks and gluons) are deconfined. Heavy quarks are considered
effective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a short
time scale, with respect to that of the QGP, and subsequently interact with it.
Moreover, for a proper assessment of the characteristics of the matter produced
in heavy-ion collisions, it is important to disentangle the final state effects
due to the formation of a QGP from the initial state effects due to the fact
that nuclei are present in the colliding system. Both initial and final state
effects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of
interest. The measurement of charmed meson production in proton-nucleus
collisions allows to assess initial state effects present in nuclear
collisions, under the assumption that an extended deconfined medium is not
created in this kind of interactions. The nuclear modification factor of $D$
mesons in p-Pb collisions ($R_{\rm pPb}$) is essential for a complete
understanding of the modification of $D$ mesons momentum distributions observed
in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$= 2.76 TeV, which is interpreted as
due to the $c$-quark energy loss in the medium. In addition, some of the
results obtained from high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions at LHC, such as the
ridge structure in the two-particle correlation function, turned out to be
unexpected, and have been interpreted in terms of final state effects such as
hydrodynamic flow. These aspects make a study of charmed meson production in
p-Pb collisions as a function of the event multiplicity of great interest.

  arXiv:1509.08742",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that if you represent all primes with less than n-digits as points in
n-dimensional space, then they can be stored and retrieved conveniently using
n-dimensional geometry. Also once you have calculated all the prime numbers
less than n digits, it is very easy to find out if a given number having less
than n-digits is or is not a prime. We do this by separating all the primes
which are represented by points in n-dimension space by planes. It so turns out
that the number of planes q, required to separate all the points represented by
primes less than n-digit, are very few in number. Thus we obtain a very
efficient storage and retrieval system in n-dimensional space. In addition the
storage and retieval repository has the property that when new primes are added
there is no need to start all over, we can begin where we last left off and add
the new primes in the repository and add new planes that separate them as and
when necessary. Also we can arrange matters such that the repository can begin
to accept larger primes which has more digits say n' where n' > n. The
algorithm does not make use of any property of prime numbers or of integers in
general,except for the fact that any n-digit integer can be represented as a
point in n-dimension space. Therefore the method can serve to be a storage and
retrieval repository of any set of given integers, in practical cases they can
represent information. Thus the algorithm can be used to devise a very
efficient storage and retrieval system for large amounts of digital data.
