have employed the coevolution of morphology and control to produce high-impact
work in multiple fields, including graphics, evolutionary computation,
robotics, and artificial life. However, in contrast to fixed-morphology
creatures, there has been no clear increase in the behavioral complexity of
EVCs in those two decades. This paper describes a method for moving beyond this
limit, making use of high-level human input in the form of a syllabus of
intermediate learning tasks--along with mechanisms for preservation, reuse, and
combination of previously learned tasks. This method--named ESP for its three
components: encapsulation, syllabus, and pandemonium--is presented in two
complementary versions: Fast ESP, which constrains later morphological changes
to achieve linear growth in computation time as behavioral complexity is added,
and General ESP, which allows this restriction to be removed when sufficient
computational resources are available. Experiments demonstrate that the ESP
method allows evolved virtual creatures to reach new levels of behavioral
complexity in the co-evolution of morphology and control, approximately
doubling the previous state of the art.

In our model, users are running elastic or inelastic traffic and each
application running on the user equipment (UE) is assigned a utility function
based on its type. Furthermore, each of the small cells users has a minimum
required target utility for its application. In order for users located under
the coverage area of the small cells' eNodeBs, with the 3.5 GHz band resources,
to meet their minimum required quality of experience (QoE), the network
operator makes a decision regarding the need for sharing the macro cell's
resources to obtain additional resources. Our objective is to provide each user
with a rate that satisfies its application's minimum required utility through
spectrum sharing approach and improve the overall QoE in the network. We
present an application-aware spectrum sharing algorithm that is based on
resource allocation with carrier aggregation to allocate macro cell permanent
resources and small cells' leased resources to UEs and allocate each user's

network according to their participation in shortest paths. Since an exact
computation is prohibitive in large networks, several approximation algorithms
have been proposed. Besides that, recent years have seen the publication of
dynamic algorithms for efficient recomputation of betweenness in networks that
change over time. In this paper we propose the first betweenness centrality
approximation algorithms with a provable guarantee on the maximum approximation
error for dynamic networks. Several new intermediate algorithmic results
contribute to the respective approximation algorithms: (i) new upper bounds on
the vertex diameter, (ii) the first fully-dynamic algorithm for updating an
approximation of the vertex diameter in undirected graphs, and (iii) an
algorithm with lower time complexity for updating single-source shortest paths
in unweighted graphs after a batch of edge actions. Using approximation, our
algorithms are the first to make in-memory computation of betweenness in
dynamic networks with millions of edges feasible. Our experiments show that our
algorithms can achieve substantial speedups compared to recomputation, up to
several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the approximation accuracy is usually
significantly better than the theoretical guarantee in terms of absolute error.
More importantly, for reasonably small approximation error thresholds, the rank
of nodes is well preserved, in particular for nodes with high betweenness.

induce large changes in polarization ellipticity and helicity. Furthermore, by
exploiting the ability of polarimetry to distinguish polarized from unpolarized
light, we quantify the contributions of different types of coherent and

standard model (SM) color sector to $SU(3)_{1c} \times SU(3)_{2c}$, with the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the extended gauge group to the diagonal QCD
facilitated by the renormalizable operators. It predicts the existence of the
beyond the SM massive color-octet gauge bosons (colorons), colored and
uncolored scalar degrees of freedom, as well as potential spectator fermions
necessary for anomaly-cancelation purposes. Furthermore, keeping the ordinary
chiral quark charge assignments under the extended color gauge group in their
most general form, the framework (effectively) captures a large class of models
available within the literature. This contribution summarizes the current
formal and phenomenological constraints on the free parameter space of the
theory, as well as the LHC $\sqrt s = 14$ TeV prospects for discovering its
heavy scalar. The model is well-constrained and highly predictive; in
particular, it is shown that the parameter space can be thoroughly probed by
the LHC and the next generation hadron colliders, making it a promising beyond
the SM candidate for exploration. In addition, the significance of the NLO
corrections to the coloron production cross section are discussed.

superposition of a large number of unresolved astrophysical sources and
phenomena in the early universe. Each component of the background (e.g., from
primordial metric perturbations, binary neutron stars, milli-second pulsars
etc.) has its own spectral shape. Many ongoing experiments aim to probe GWB at
a variety of frequency bands. In the last two decades, using data from
ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave (GW) observatories, upper
limits on GWB were placed in the frequency range of ~50-1000 Hz, considering
one spectral shape at a time. However, one strong component can significantly
enhance the estimated strength of another component. Hence, estimation of the
amplitudes of the components with different spectral shapes should be done
jointly. Here we propose a method for ""component separation"" of a statistically
isotropic background, that can, for the first time, jointly estimate the
amplitudes of many components and place upper limits. The method is rather
straightforward and needs negligible amount of computation. It utilises the
linear relationship between the measurements and the amplitudes of the actual
components, alleviating the need for a sampling based method, e.g., Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or matched filtering, which are computationally
intensive and cumbersome in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using this
formalism we could also study how many independent components can be separated
using a given dataset from a network of current and upcoming ground based
interferometric detectors.

plays a crucial role in many phylogenomic studies. Often such estimation is
based on the parsimony assumption, implying that the distance between two
genomes can be estimated as the rearrangement distance equal the minimal number
of genome rearrangements required to transform one genome into the other.
However, in reality the parsimony assumption may not always hold, emphasizing
the need for estimation that does not rely on the rearrangement distance. The
distance that accounts for the actual (rather than minimal) number of
rearrangements between two genomes is often referred to as the true
evolutionary distance. While there exists a method for the true evolutionary
distance estimation, it however assumes that genomes can be broken by
rearrangements equally likely at any position in the course of evolution. This
assumption, known as the random breakage model, has recently been refuted in
favor of the more rigorous fragile breakage model postulating that only certain
""fragile"" genomic regions are prone to rearrangements.
  We propose a new method for estimating the true evolutionary distance between
two genomes under the fragile breakage model. We evaluate the proposed method
on simulated genomes, which show its high accuracy. We further apply the
proposed method for estimation of evolutionary distances within a set of five

metastable form of water ice, so called cubic ice (Ic). Through its defective
nature and small particle size the surface film composed of such material is
incapable of creating any significant diffusion barrier. Above 160 K, cubic ice
gradually transforms to the stable hexagonal (Ih) form on laboratory time
scales. The annealing, coupled with a parallel decomposition of gas hydrates,
accelerates as temperature rises but already above 190 K the first process
prevails, transforming cubic stacking sequences in-to ordinary Ih ice within a
few minutes. Remaining stacking faults are removed through very slow isothermal
annealing or after heating up above 240 K. The role of the proportion of cubic
stacking on the decomposition rate is discussed. A better understanding of the
dissociation kinetics at low temperatures is particularly im-portant for the
critical evaluation of existing hypotheses that consider clathrates as a
potential medium that actively participate in geological processes or is able
to store gases (e.g. CH4, CO2 or Xe) in environments like comets, icy moons (i.

one-dimensional models the results of NLC are compared with exact
diagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well. The NLC
results are also obtained for two dimensional XXZ and transverse-field Ising

a finite temperature above which the negativity is zero. We use perturbation
theory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset (or sudden death).
The onset of EN or its magnitude are insensitive to classical

all theoretical studies so far the D-terms of various particles were found
negative. Early works gave rise to the assumption the negative sign could be
related to stability. The emerging question is whether it is possible to find a
field-theoretical system with a positive D-term. To shed some light on this
question we investigate Q-clouds, an extreme parametric limit in the Q-ball
system. Q-clouds are classically unstable solutions which delocalize, spread
out over all space forming an infinitely dilute gas of free quanta, and are
even energetically unstable against tunneling to plane waves. In short, these
extremely unstable field configurations provide an ideal candidate system for
our purposes. By studying the energy-momentum tensor we show that at any stage
of the Q-cloud limit one deals with perfectly well-defined and, when viewed in
appropriately scaled coordinates, non-dissipating non-topological solitonic
solutions. We investigate in detail their properties, and find new physical
interpretations by observing that Q-clouds resemble BPS Skyrmions in certain
aspects, and correspond to universal non-perturbative solutions in (complex)
|\Phi|^4 theory. In particular, we show that also Q-cloud solutions have
negative D-terms. Our findings do not prove that D-terms must always be
negative. But they indicate that it is unlikely to realize a positive D-term in

incorporate structured codes in this case, one can utilize matrix
decompositions that transform the channel into effective parallel scalar dirty

strongly depend on the chosen decomposition. It is shown that a recently
proposed decomposition, where the diagonals of the effective channel matrices

radiation, but rather reflects it back to space. The design is based on a
periodic layered structure composed of alternating SiO2 and Si3N4 layers with a
single GaAs defect layer in the middle. At low intensities, the layered
structure displays a strong resonant transmission via the localized defect
mode. At high intensities, the two-photon absorption in the GaAs layer
suppresses the localized mode along with the resonant transmission, the entire
layered structure turns highly reflective within a broad frequency range
covering the entire photonic band gap of the periodic layered structure. By
contrast, a stand-alone GaAs layer would absorb most of the high-level
radiation, thus acting as a basic absorptive optical limiter. The proposed
design can only perform at shortwave IR, where GaAs displays negligible linear
absorption and very strong nonlinear two-photon absorption. With judicious
choice of optical materials, the same principle can be replicated for any other

explained as follows: Although convexity brings more structure than
unimodality, for some worst-case design points this extra structure is
uninformative and the nonparametric rates of unimodal regression and convex
regression are both $n^{-2/3}$.

steering have been proposed and experimentally implemented. On the operational
side, however, the evaluation of the steerability degree of a given state has
shown to be a difficult task and only a few results are known. In this work, we
propose a measure of steering that is based on the maximal violation of well
established steering inequalities. Applying this approach to two-qubit states,
we managed to derive simple closed formulas for steering in the two- and

found that correctly satisfies the entanglement-steering-nonlocality hierarchy

dephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations
due to the Rydberg blockade. This description yields good agreement with our

times, the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively, suggesting additional
dephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van

by the absence of a soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking mass for the NMSSM
singlet S. In our framework, S is a meson in a hidden QCD. This QCD is
responsible for the dynamical SUSY breaking, forming S, and the soft SUSY
breaking mass for S, which is a key to explain the correct EWSB: all the
ingredients for successful phenomenology originate from the common dynamics.
From the requirement of the successful EWSB, the low-scale SUSY breaking around
100-1000 TeV is predicted. This is favored to avoid the large fine-tuning.

Data-driven approaches, on the other hand, can quickly deliver a solution, but
the results often suffer from lower accuracy or missing anatomical validity
compared to those obtained from model-based approaches. In this work we propose
a hybrid approach for hand pose estimation from a single depth image. First, a
learned regressor is employed to deliver multiple initial hypotheses for the 3D
position of each hand joint. Subsequently, the kinematic parameters of a 3D
hand model are found by deliberately exploiting the inherent uncertainty of the
inferred joint proposals. This way, the method provides anatomically valid and
accurate solutions without requiring manual initialisation or suffering from
track losses. Quantitative results on several standard datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art representatives of the
model-based, data-driven and hybrid paradigms.

secure spectroscopic ID, a date of $V$-band maximum light, and multiple spectra
at different phases. We analyze these spectra as a function of subtype and
phase in order to improve the SN identification scheme and constrain the
progenitors of different kinds of stripped SNe. By comparing spectra of SNe IIb
with those of SNe Ib, we find that the strength of H$\alpha$ can be used to
quantitatively differentiate between these two subtypes at all epochs.
Moreover, we find a continuum in observational properties between SNe IIb and

quite different from eta Car in duration. Their bright phases typically last
for 100~d or less, rather than persisting for several years. The transient
object UGC2773-OT had a similar peak absolute magnitude to other SN impostors,
but with a gradual 5-yr prediscovery rise. In the 6 yr since discovery, it has
faded very slowly (0.26 mag/yr). Overall, we suggest that its decade-long
eruption is so far the best known analog of eta Car's 19th century eruption. We
discuss extensive spectroscopy of the ongoing eruption. The spectra show
interesting changes in velocity and line shape that we discuss in detail,
including an asymmetric Halpha emission line that we show is consistent with
the ejection of a bipolar nebula that could be very much like the Homunculus of
eta Car. Moreover, changes in the line width, line profile, blue excess
emission resembling that of Type IIn supernovae, and the intensity of Halpha
suggest the presence of strong circumstellar interaction in the eruption at
late times. This supports the hypothesis that the extended plateau of eta Car's
eruption may have been powered by shock interaction as well. One interesting
difference compared to eta Car, however, is that UGC2773-OT so far does not
exhibit the repeated brief spikes in luminosity that have been associated with
binary periastron events.

infrared spectra of fifty stars hosting gas giant planets on short-period

of cool stellar companions in the spectra of our target stars, where we are
sensitive to companions with temperatures between 3500-5000 K and projected
separations less than 100 AU in most systems. We identify eight systems with
candidate low-mass companions, including one companion that was independently
detected in our AO imaging survey. For systems with radial velocity
accelerations, a spectroscopic non-detection rules out scenarios involving a
stellar companion in a high inclination orbit. We use these data to place an
upper limit on the stellar binary fraction at small projected separations, and
show that the observed population of candidate companions is consistent with
that of field stars and also with the population of wide-separation companions

neutral gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas, neutral}$), stellar mass ($M_{\rm stellar}$)
and star formation rate (SFR) account for most of the variance seen in the
population, with galaxies tracing a two-dimensional, nearly flat, surface in
the three-dimensional space of $f_{\rm gas, neutral}-M_{\rm stellar}-\rm SFR$

whereas galaxies themselves move along the plane as their $f_{\rm gas,

are highly correlated with gas metallicity. The metallicity can therefore be
robustly predicted from $f_{\rm gas, neutral}$, or from the $M_{\rm stellar}$
and SFR. We argue that the appearance of this ""fundamental plane of star

by the dependence of the SFR on gas density and metallicity. We analyse a large

Ia. This excess is consistent with 1E-5 M_solar of newly formed dust, which
would be the first time that newly formed dust has been observed to form in a
normal Type Ia. The excess, however, is also consistent with a dusty CSM that
was likely formed in pre-explosion mass-loss, thereby suggesting a single
degenerate progenitor system. Compared to other SNe Ia that show significant

degeneracy), we train Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) on a large ""model catalogs""
generated from appropriate Monte Carlo sampling of our fuzzy archetypes to
cluster the predicted observables in a topologically smooth fashion. Subsequent
sampling over the SOM then allows full reconstruction of the relevant
probability distribution functions (PDFs) using the associated set of inverse
mappings from the SOM to the underlying model parameters. This combined
approach enables the multi-modal exploration of known variation among galaxy
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using large numbers of archetypes with
minimal modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the power of this approach to
recover full redshift PDFs using discrete Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling methods combined with SOMs constructed from model catalogs based on
LSST $ugrizY$ and Euclid $YJH$ mock photometry.

build, optimize and train several estimators to predict metallicity. We use the
observed photometry, as well as derived quantities such as stellar mass and
photometric redshift, as features, and we build two sample data sets at median
redshifts of 0.103 and 0.218 and median r-band magnitude of 17.5 and 18.3
respectively. We find that ensemble methods, such as Random Forests of Trees

comparably well and can measure metallicity with a Root Mean Square Error

complex relationships between data and target, our technique performs better

analytic fitting formula, and has 3x more constraining power than SED
fitting-based methods. Additionally, this method is extremely forgiving of
contamination in the training set, and can be used with very satisfactory
results for training sample sizes of just a few hundred objects. We distribute

the full depth of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) observations, which brings
the number of multiply imaged systems to 61, ten of which are spectroscopically
confirmed. The total number of images comprised in these systems rises to 165.
Our analysis uses a parametric mass reconstruction technique, as implemented in
the Lenstool software, to constrain a mass distribution composed of four
large-scale mass components + galaxy-scale perturbers. We find a superposition
of cored isothermal mass components to provide a good fit to the observational
constraints, resulting in a very shallow mass distribution for the smooth
(large-scale) component. Given the implications of such a flat mass profile, we
investigate whether a model composed of ""peaky"" non-cored mass components can
also reproduce the observational constraints. We find that such a non-cored
mass model reproduces the observational constraints equally well. Although the
total mass distributions of both models are consistent, as well as the
integrated two dimensional mass profiles, we find that the smooth and the
galaxy-scale components are very different. We conclude that, even in the HFF
era, the generic degeneracy between smooth and galaxy-scale components is not
broken, in particular in such a complex galaxy cluster. Consequently, insights
into the mass distribution of MACS J0717 remain limited, underlining the need
for additional probes beyond strong lensing. Our findings also have
implications for estimates of the lensing magnification: we show that the
amplification difference between the two models is larger than the error
associated with either model. This uncertainty decreases the area of the image
plane where we can reliably study the high-redshift Universe by 50 to 70%.

filtering semantics is identical to the classical MTL semantics. We also

Beyond these standard applications, the information contained in the data may
be richer than expected and may lead to a better understanding of the wind
dynamics in a geographical area. In this work we propose a statistical analysis
based on the wind velocity vectors, which we propose may be grouped in ""wind
states"" associated to binormal distribution functions. We found that the
velocity plane defined by the anemometric velocity data may be used as a phase
space, where a finite number of states may be found and sorted using standard
clustering methods. The main result is a discretization technique useful to
model the wind with Markov chains. We applied such ideas in anemometric data
for two different sites in Mexico where the wind resource is considered
reliable. The approximated Markov chains of both places give a set of values
for transition probabilities and residence times that may be regarded as a
signature of the dynamics of the site. We consider the results may impact
either the technical decisions for the design of wind generators or the
detailed resource assessment in sites with non-standard features.

between gas and star formation rate across a range in size scales from 20 pc to

recursion relations. We compute corrections to the anomalous dimension of large
spin operators due to the exchange of a primary and its descendants in the
crossed channel and show that this leads to a Borel-summable expansion. We
analyse higher order corrections to the microscopic CFT data in the direct
channel and its matching to infinite towers of operators in the crossed
channel. We apply this method to the critical $O(N)$ model. At large $N$ we
reproduce the first few terms in the large spin expansion of the known two-loop
anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in the traceless symmetric
representation of $O(N)$ and make further predictions. At small $N$ we present
the results for the truncated large spin expansion series of anomalous
dimensions of higher spin currents.

provide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold
atmospheres. The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target
for such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high
levels of variability. Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the
Solar system, allowing precise astrometric investigations with ground-based
facilities. Aims. The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and
study the astrometric motion of both components. Methods. We have monitored
Luhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on
the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla, through a special i+z long-pass filter,
which allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects.
An intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which
we observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 \pm 0.02 mag and 0.34 \pm 0.02
mag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. Results. We used the 16-night
time-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. We
found that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 \pm 0.1 hr, in very good
agreement with previous measurements. For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates
slower than its companion and, even though we were not able to get a robust
determination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 hr. This
implies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and
suggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion
process. The 2-year complete dataset was used to study the astrometric motion
of Luhman 16AB. We predict a motion of the system that is not consistent with a
previous estimate based on two months of monitoring, but cannot confirm or
refute the presence of additional planetary-mass bodies in the system.

agricultural, and industrial processes. By systematically investigating
important variables such as impact energy, the size of impinging drops and the
degree of liquid saturation in granular beds, we uncover a novel scaling for
the size of impact craters. We show that this scaling can be explained by
considering the balance between the inertia of impinging drops and the strength
of impacted surface. Such a theoretical understanding confirms that the unique
energy partition originally proposed for liquid-drop impact cratering in dry
granular media also applies for impact cratering in wet granular media.
Moreover, we demonstrate that compressive stresses, instead of shear stresses,
control granular impact cratering. Our study enriches the picture of generic
granular impact cratering and sheds light on the familiar phenomena of raindrop
impacts in granular media.

stochastic setting in which agents learn about each other through repeated
interactions and maintain/break links on the basis of what they learn from
these interactions. Agents have homophilous preferences and limited capacity,
so they maintain links with others who are learned to be similar to themselves
and cut links to others who are learned to be dissimilar to themselves. Thus
learning influences the evolution of the network, but learning is imperfect so
the evolution is stochastic. Homophily matters. Higher levels of homophily
decrease the (average) number of links that agents form. However, the effect of
homophily is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped before
learning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and less
clustering than under complete information. There may be big differences
between the networks that emerge under complete and incomplete information.
Homophily matters here as well: initially, greater levels of homophily increase
the difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, but
sufficiently high levels of homophily eventually decrease the difference.
Complete and incomplete information networks differ the most when the degree of
homophily is intermediate. With multiple stages of life, the effects of
incomplete information are large initially but fade somewhat over time.

between excitations in the topological order and defects in the long-ranged

reaction. The IBD results for fragments with neutron-excess $I = $ 0 and 1 are
obtained. A small difference is found in the IBDs with the $b1$ and $b2$

quite similar in the AMD + GEMINI simulated reactions. \item[Conclusions] The
IBDs for the $I =$ 0 and 1 chains are mainly determined by the central
collisions, which reflects the nuclear density in the core region of the

the difference between the densities in the peripheral collisions of the

the same time, law enforcement agents attempt to dismantle the growing
organization using pursuit strategies that initiate on the lower level nodes
and that unfold as self-avoiding random walks. The global details of the
organization are unknown to law enforcement, who must explore the hierarchy

assumed to be eradicated if the kingpin is arrested. We first analyze
recruitment and study the large scale properties of the growing network; later
we add pursuit and use numerical simulations to study the eradication

expressions for the shear modulus, viscosity, and fragility in terms of the

are able to link the steepness of the interionic repulsion to the Thomas-Fermi
screened Coulomb repulsion and to the Born-Mayer valence-electron overlap

the fragility of the supercooled liquid metal in terms of few crucial

up opportunities to fabricate alloys with tailored thermo-elasticity and

programs from specifications - has become a hot research topic in the past few
years. For decades the problem was thought to be insurmountable: the search
space of possible programs is far too massive to efficiently traverse. Advances
in efficient constraint solving have overcome this barrier, enabling a new
generation of effective synthesis systems. Most existing systems compile
synthesis tasks down to low-level SMT instances, sacrificing high-level
semantic information while solving only first-order problems (i.e., filling
integer holes). Recent work takes an alternative approach, using the
Curry-Howard isomorphism and techniques from automated theorem proving to
construct higher-order programs with algebraic datatypes.
  My thesis involved extending this type-directed synthesis engine to handle
product types, which required significant modifications to both the underlying
theory and the tool itself. Product types streamline other language features,
eliminating variable-arity constructors among other workarounds employed in the
original synthesis system. A form of logical conjunction, products are
invertible, making it possible to equip the synthesis system with an efficient
theorem-proving technique called focusing that eliminates many of the
nondeterministic choices inherent in proof search. These theoretical
enhancements informed a new version of the type-directed synthesis prototype
implementation, which remained performance-competitive with the original
synthesizer. A significant advantage of the type-directed synthesis framework
is its extensibility; this thesis is a roadmap for future such efforts to
increase the expressive power of the system.

powerful outflows of matter in the Universe. The formation process of powerful

jet formation are currently hotly debated. In this paper, we report an
unambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close to
the black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launched
from the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive black
holes. In these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole is
characterized by a power law at X-ray energies during times when the jets are
produced. We find that the photon index of this power law, which gives
information on the underlying particle distribution, correlates with the
characteristic break frequency in the jet spectrum, which is dependent on
magnetohydrodynamical processes in the outflow. The observed range in break
frequencies varies by five orders of magnitude, in sources that span nine
orders of magnitude in black hole mass, revealing a similarity of jet
properties over a large range of black hole masses powering these jets. This
correlation demonstrates that the internal properties of the jet rely most
critically on the conditions of the plasma close to the black hole, rather than
other parameters such as the black hole mass or spin, and will provide a
benchmark that should be reproduced by the jet formation models.

on the AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as holography. In a Landau Fermi
Liquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin
at low temperature $T$. The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the
competition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction
between two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-$1/2$
impurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a
Kondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one
another. Our holographic model is based on a $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT
description of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with
negligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally
anti-symmetric representation of an $SU(N)$ spin symmetry. We employ a
large-$N$ limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and
both Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace
operators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic
renormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY
couplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS. We numerically compute the
phase diagram of our model in the plane of RKKY coupling versus $T$, finding
evidence for a quantum phase transition from a trivial phase, with neither
Kondo nor inter-impurity screening, to a non-trivial phase, with both Kondo and
anti-ferromagnetic inter-impurity screening. More generally we show, just using
$SU(N)$ representation theory, that ferromagnetic correlations must be absent
at leading order in the large-$N$ limit. Our holographic model may be useful
for studying many open problems involving strongly-interacting quantum
impurities, including for example the Kondo lattice, relevant for describing
the heavy fermion compounds.

asymmetry is observed in both the ${\nu}_e$ and ${\nu}_{\mu}$ samples at 8.0
{\sigma} and 6.0 {\sigma} significance, respectively, and an indication that
the asymmetry dipole angle changes depending on the zenith angle was seen at
the 2.2 {\sigma} level. The measured energy and azimuthal spectra are
consistent with the current flux models within the estimated systematic
uncertainties. A study of the long-term correlation between the atmospheric
neutrino flux and the solar magnetic activity cycle is also performed, and a
weak indication of a correlation was seen at the 1.1 {\sigma} level, using SK
I-IV data spanning a 20 year period. For particularly strong solar activity
periods known as Forbush decreases, no theoretical prediction is available, but
a deviation below the typical neutrino event rate is seen at the 2.4 {\sigma}
level.

defined by invariant one-forms on Lie groups. As an instance, the first order
differential equations describing the extremal solutions of an optimal control
problem for a single spinning particle, obtained by using Pontryagin's Maximum

matrix differential equations. The reduction of the implicit system will show
that the reduced space for them is the product of the space of states for the
independent systems, implying the absence of `entanglement' in this instance.

three matrix polynomial differential equations determined by the optimal

theoretical studies with open issues in the field. We develop an entanglement
density matrix renormalization group (En-DMRG) algorithm to accurately target
the entanglement patterns of highly excited states for MBL systems. By studying
the one dimensional Heisenberg spin chain in a random field, we demonstrate the
high accuracy of the method in obtaining statistical results of quantum states

demonstrate that the transition from the MBL phase to the delocalized ergodic
phase is driven by rare events where the locally entangled spin pairs develop
long-range power-law correlations. The corresponding phase diagram contains an
intermediate regime, which has power-law spin-z correlations resulting from
contributions of the rare events. We discuss the physical picture for the

this as a correlated variation in the ages of halo stars, from older to
younger, spanning a range of a few Gyrs. We have applied this approach to a
sample of some 4700 spectroscopically confirmed BHB stars selected from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey to produce the first ""chronographic map"" of the halo

conditional distributions in hierarchical and mixed models, which arise
frequently in many settings in the health, social, and biological sciences.
Variational inference in a frequentist context works by approximating
intractable conditional distributions with a tractable family and optimizing
the resulting lower bound on the log-likelihood. The variational objective
function is typically less computationally intensive to optimize than the true
likelihood, enabling scientists to fit rich models even with extremely large
datasets. Despite widespread use, little is known about the general theoretical
properties of estimators arising from variational approximations to the
log-likelihood, which hinders their use in inferential statistics. In this
paper we connect such estimators to profile M-estimation, which enables us to
provide regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of
variational estimators. Our theory also motivates three methodological
improvements to variational inference: estimation of the asymptotic
model-robust covariance matrix, a one-step correction that improves estimator
efficiency, and an empirical assessment of consistency. We evaluate the
proposed results using simulation studies and data on marijuana use from the
National Longitudinal Study of Youth.

scenes. Intuitively, instances of pedestrians with different spatial scales may
exhibit dramatically different features. Thus, large variance in instance
scales, which results in undesirable large intra-category variance in features,
may severely hurt the performance of modern object instance detection methods.
We argue that this issue can be substantially alleviated by the
divide-and-conquer philosophy. Taking pedestrian detection as an example, we
illustrate how we can leverage this philosophy to develop a Scale-Aware Fast
R-CNN (SAF R-CNN) framework. The model introduces multiple built-in
sub-networks which detect pedestrians with scales from disjoint ranges. Outputs
from all the sub-networks are then adaptively combined to generate the final
detection results that are shown to be robust to large variance in instance
scales, via a gate function defined over the sizes of object proposals.
Extensive evaluations on several challenging pedestrian detection datasets well
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAF R-CNN. Particularly, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Caltech, INRIA, and ETH, and
obtains competitive results on KITTI.

regime-switching between a normal market phase represented by a geometric
Brownian motion (GBM) and a bubble regime represented by the stochastic
super-exponential Sornette-Andersen (2002) bubble model. The calibration of the
HMM provides the probability at each time for a given security to be in the
bubble regime. Conditional on two assets being qualified in the bubble regime,
we then use the transfer entropy to quantify the influence of the returns of
one asset $i$ onto another asset $j$, from which we introduce the adjacency
matrix of the SIN among securities. We apply our technology to the Chinese
stock market during the period 2005-2008, during which a normal phase was
followed by a spectacular bubble ending in a massive correction. We introduce
the Net Speculative Influence Intensity (NSII) variable as the difference
between the transfer entropies from $i$ to $j$ and from $j$ to $i$, which is
used in a series of rank ordered regressions to predict the maximum loss
(\%{MaxLoss}) endured during the crash. The sectors that influenced other
sectors the most are found to have the largest losses. There is a clear
prediction skill obtained by using the transfer entropy involving industrial
sectors to explain the \%{MaxLoss} of financial institutions but not vice
versa. We also show that the bubble state variable calibrated on the Chinese
market data corresponds well to the regimes when the market exhibits a strong
price acceleration followed by clear change of price regimes. Our results

  Optical Wireless Systems","26 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectrally and energy efficient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(SEE-OFDM) is an optical OFDM technique based on combining multiple
asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) signals into one OFDM signal. By
summing different components together, SEE-OFDM can achieve the same spectral
efficiency as DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) without an energy-inefficient
DC-bias. This paper introduces multiple methods for decoding a SEE-OFDM symbol
and shows that an iterative decoder with hard decisions gives the best
performance. Being a multi-component format, different energy allocation
amongst the different components of SEE-OFDM is possible. However, equal energy
allocation performs 1.5 dB better than unequal energy allocation. A
hard-decision, iterative subtraction receiver can further increase performance
by another 1.5 dB over soft-decision subtraction and reconstruction receivers.
SEE-OFDM consistently performs 3 dB or better and with higher spectral
efficiency than ACO-OFDM at the same bit-error-rate (BER). Comparing other
combination methods at the same BER, SEE-OFDM performs up to 3 dB better than
hybrid asymmetrically clipped optical (OFDM) (HACO-OFDM) and up to 1.5 dB
better than asymmetrically and symmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ASCO-OFDM)
and enhanced unipolar OFDM (eU-OFDM) when using hard decisions at the receiver.
Additionally, SEE-OFDM has the best peak-to-average-power rate (PAPR) as
compared to the other combination OFDM formats and ACO-OFDM, which makes it
excellent for any range limited optical source, such as laser diodes and
light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In summary, SEE-OFDM is shown to have excellent
properties to glean additional capacity from an intensity modulation and direct

technirho for the 2 TeV diboson excesses reported by the ATLAS collaboration,
with a special emphasis on the hidden local symmetry (HLS) constraints. We
first show that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs Lagrangian is equivalent to the
scale-invariant nonlinear chiral Lagrangian, which is further gauge equivalent
to the scale-invariant HLS model, with the scale symmetry realized nonlinearly
via SM Higgs as a (pseudo-) dilaton. The scale symmetry forbids the new vector
boson decay to the 125 GeV Higgs plus W/Z boson, in sharp contrast to the
conventional ""equivalence theorem"" which is invalidated by the conformality.
The HLS forbids mixing between the iso-triplet technirho's, rho_{Pi} and
rho_{P}, of the one-family walking technicolor (with four doublets
N_D=N_F/2=4), which, without the HLS, would be generated when switching on the
standard model gauging. We also present updated analyses of the walking
technrho's for the diboson excesses by fully incorporating the constraints from
the conformal barrier and the HLS as well as possible higher order effects:
still characteristic of the one-family walking technirho is its smallness of
the decay width, roughly of order Gamma/M_rho ~ [3/N_C x 1/N_D] x
[Gamma/M_rho]_{QCD} ~ 70 GeV/2TeV (N_D= N_C=4), in perfect agreement with the
expected diboson resonance with Gamma<100 GeV. The model is so sharply
distinguishable from other massive spin 1 models without the conformality and
HLS that it is clearly testable at the LHC Run II. If the 2 TeV boson decay to
WH/ZH is not observed in the ongoing Run II, then the conformality is operative
on the 125 GeV Higgs, strongly suggesting that the 2 TeV excess events are
responsible for the walking technirhos and the 125 GeV Higgs is the
technidilaton.

measure the observable properties from synthetic column density maps. We
confirm that a significant fraction of unbound clouds forms naturally in a
galactic disc environment and that a mixed population of bound and unbound
clouds can match observed scaling relations and distributions for extragalactic
molecular clouds. By dividing the clouds into inner and outer disc populations,
we compare their distributions of properties and test whether there are
statistically significant differences between them. We find that clouds in the
outer disc have lower masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions as compared to
those in the inner disc for reasonable choices of the inner/outer boundary. We
attribute the differences to the strong impact of galactic shear on the disc
stability at large galactocentric radii. In particular, our Toomre analysis of
the disc shows a narrowing envelope of unstable masses as a function of radius,
resulting in the formation of smaller, lower mass fragments in the outer disc.
We also show that the star formation rate is affected by the environment of the
parent cloud, and is particularly influenced by the underlying surface density
profile of the gas throughout the disc. Our work highlights the strengths of
using galaxy-scale simulations to understand the formation and evolution of
cloud properties - and the star formation within them - in the context of their
environment.

a threshold refractive index contrast that depends on the crystal structure. In

All mechanisms known to us currently make use of electromagnetic interaction to
accelerate charged particles. In this paper we propose a mechanism exclusively
based on gravity rather than electromagnetic interaction. We show that it is
possible to generate ultra-high-energy particles starting from particles with
moderate energies using the collisional Penrose process in an overspinning Kerr
spacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,
with the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider two massive particles starting from rest at
infinity that collide at $r=M$ with divergent center-of-mass energy and produce
two massless particles. We show that massless particles produced in the
collision can escape to infinity with the ultra-high energies exploiting the
collisional Penrose process with the divergent efficiency $\eta \sim
{1}/{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \rightarrow \infty$. Assuming the isotropic emission of
massless particles in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding particles, we
show that half of the particles created in the collisions escape to infinity
with the divergent energies. To a distant observer, ultra-high-energy particles
appear to originate from a bright spot which is at the angular location $\xi

at national metrology institutes, is supposed to generate strong and uniform
magnetic field in an air gap in the radial direction. However, in reality the
fringe effect due to the finite height of the air gap will introduce an
undesired vertical magnetic component to the air gap, which should either be
measured or modeled towards some optimizations of the watt balance. A recent
publication, i.e., {\it Metrologia} 52(4) 445 [1], presented a full field
mapping method, which in theory will supply useful information for profile
characterization and misalignment analysis. This article is an additional
material of [1], which develops a different analytical algorithm to represent
the 3D magnetic field of a watt balance magnet based on only one measurement
for the radial magnetic flux density along the vertical direction, $B_r(z)$.
The new algorithm is based on the electromagnetic nature of the magnet, which
has a much better accuracy.

difficult logistical challenge. Instead, we describe the design of a new type
of QR code that not only enables the use of multiple QR codes in close

evaluation with 20 users, it was found that the new QR codes were as usable as
traditional ones, and that they were superior for selecting one code from many.

further work is required on that front. We conclude with a discussion of the

structure, including luminous red galaxies (LRGs), emission line galaxies
(ELGs) and quasars (both as a direct probe of structure and through the
Ly-$\alpha$ forest). Focusing on discrete tracers, we forecast the expected
accuracy of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space
distortion (RSD) measurements, the $f_{\rm NL}$ parameter quantifying the
primordial non-Gaussianity, the dark energy and modified gravity parameters. We
also use the line-of-sight clustering in the Ly-$\alpha$ forest to constrain
the total neutrino mass. We find that eBOSS LRGs ($0.6<z<1.0$) (combined with
the BOSS LRGs at $z>0.6$), ELGs ($0.6<z<1.2$) and Clustering Quasars (CQs)
($0.6<z<2.2$) can achieve a precision of 1%, 2.2% and 1.6% precisions,
respectively, for spherically averaged BAO distance measurements. Using the
same samples, the constraint on $f\sigma_8$ is expected to be 2.5%, 3.3% and
2.8% respectively. For primordial non-Gaussianity, eBOSS alone can reach an
accuracy of $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})\sim10-15$, depending on the external
measurement of the galaxy bias and our ability to model large-scale systematic
errors. eBOSS can at most improve the dark energy Figure of Merit (FoM) by a
factor of $3$ for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation, and can
well constrain three eigenmodes for the general equation-of-state parameter

Half Maximum of a Point Spread Function, is a basic property of an image. Here,
we present a new statistical definition of image resolution based on the
cross-correlation properties of the pixels in an image. It is shown that the
new definition of image resolution depends not only on the PSF of an imaging
device, but also on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and on the structures
of an object. In an image, the resolution does not have to be uniform. Our new
definition is also suitable for the interpretation of the result of a
deconvolution. We illustrate this, in this paper, with a Wiener deconvolution.
It is found that weak structures can be extracted from low signal-to-noise
ratio data, but with low resolution; a high-resolution image was obtained from
high signal-to-noise ratio data after a Wiener deconvolution. The new
definition can also be used to compare various deconvolution algorithms on
their processing effects, such as resolution, sensitivity and sidelobe level,
etc.

gravitational potential by a non-zero mass distribution along the line of sight
is usually referred to as Shapiro delay. Shapiro delay has been extensively
measured in the Solar system and in binary pulsars, enabling stringent tests of
general relativity as well as measurement of neutron star masses . However,
Shapiro delay is ubiquitous and experienced by all astrophysical messengers on
their way from the source to the Earth. We calculate the ""one-way"" static
Shapiro delay for the first discovered millisecond pulsar PSR~B1937+21, by
including the contributions from both the dark matter and baryonic matter
between this pulsar and the Earth. We find a value of approximately 5 days (of
which 4.74 days is from the dark matter and 0.22 days from the baryonic
matter). We also calculate the modulation of Shapiro delay from the motion of a
single dark matter halo, and also evaluate the cumulative effects of the motion
of matter distribution on the change in pulsar's period and its derivative. The
time-dependent effects are too small to be detected with the current timing
noise observed for this pulsar. Finally, we would like to emphasize that
although the one-way Shapiro delay is mostly of academic interest for
electromagnetic astronomy, its ubiquity should not be forgotten in the era of
multi-messenger astronomy.

deriving complexity results for first-order descent methods in convex
minimization. In a first stage, this objective led us to revisit the interplay
between error bounds and the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) inequality. One can
show the equivalence between the two concepts for convex functions having a
moderately flat profile near the set of minimizers (as those of functions with
H\""olderian growth). A counterexample shows that the equivalence is no longer
true for extremely flat functions. This fact reveals the relevance of an
approach based on KL inequality. In a second stage, we show how KL inequalities
can in turn be employed to compute new complexity bounds for a wealth of
descent methods for convex problems. Our approach is completely original and
makes use of a one-dimensional worst-case proximal sequence in the spirit of
the famous majorant method of Kantorovich. Our result applies to a very simple
abstract scheme that covers a wide class of descent methods. As a byproduct of
our study, we also provide new results for the globalization of KL inequalities
in the convex framework.
  Our main results inaugurate a simple methodology: derive an error bound,
compute the desingularizing function whenever possible, identify essential
constants in the descent method and finally compute the complexity using the
one-dimensional worst case proximal sequence. Our method is illustrated through
projection methods for feasibility problems, and through the famous iterative
shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA), for which we show that the complexity
bound is of the form $O(q^{k})$ where the constituents of the bound only depend
on error bound constants obtained for an arbitrary least squares objective with
$\ell^1$ regularization.

armchair direction is determined to be 86.25-131.2 Wm-1K-1 with a flake length
of 5-100 um, and the corresponding value in the zigzag direction is
approximately 42% of that in the armchair direction. Other important thermal
properties of M2CO2 are also considered, including their specific heat and
thermal expansion coefficients. The theoretical room temperature thermal
expansion coefficient of Hf2CO2 is 6.094x10-6 K-1, which is lower than that of
most metals. Moreover, Hf2CO2 is determined to be a semiconductor with a band
gap of 1.657 eV and to have high and anisotropic carrier mobility. At room

direction) is determined to be as high as 13.5x103 cm2V-1s-1 (17.6x103

Hf2CO2 as a material for nanoelectronics is likely because of its moderate band

excellent carrier mobility. The corresponding thermal and electrical properties
of Ti2CO2 and Zr2CO2 are also provided here for comparison. Notably, Ti2CO2

significant importance in the signal processing community. While the original
idea was to utilize sparsity assumptions to design powerful recovery algorithms
of vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the concept has been extended to cover many
other types of problems. A noteable example is low-rank matrix recovery. Many
methods used for recovery rely on solving convex programs.
  A particularly nice trait of compressed sensing is its geometrical intuition.
In recent papers, a classical optimality condition has been used together with
tools from convex geometry and probability theory to prove beautiful results
concerning the recovery of signals from Gaussian measurements. In this paper,
we aim to formulate a geometrical condition for stability and robustness, i.e.
for the recovery of approximately structured signals from noisy measurements.
  We will investigate the connection between the new condition with the notion
of restricted singular values, classical stability and robustness conditions in
compressed sensing, and also to important geometrical concepts from complexity
theory. We will also prove the maybe somewhat surprising fact that for many
convex programs, exact recovery of a signal $x_0$ immediately implies some
stability and robustness when recovering signals close to $x_0$.

$\gamma$-stable and $\gamma$-rigid axial vibration-rotation is used to describe
the collective properties of few neutron rich transitional nuclei. The coupling
between the two types of collective motion is managed through a rigidity
parameter which also influences the geometry of the shape-phase space. While
the $\gamma$-angular part of the problem associated to axially symmetric shapes
is treated within the small angles approximation and the stiff $\gamma$
oscillation hypothesis, the $\beta$ vibration is described by means of a
Davidson potential. The resulting model have three free parameters not counting
the scale and was successfully applied for the description of the collective
spectra for few heavier isotopes of Gd and Dy. In both cases a critical nucleus
was identified through a discontinuous behavior in respect to the rigidity
parameter and relevant experimental observables.

central observation of the paper is that the fluctuations of multi-time or

models which share the same asymptotic behavior of the recurrence matrices,
also share the same asymptotic behavior for the global fluctuations. An
important special case is when the recurrence matrices have limits along the
diagonals, in which case we prove Central Limit Theorems for the linear
statistics. We then show that these results prove Gaussian Free Field
fluctuations for the random surfaces associated to these systems. To illustrate
the results, several examples will be discussed, including non-colliding

edges. We investigate the same when queries are on nodes. In this setting a
graph $G = (V, E)$ on $n$ vertices and a property $\mathcal{P}$ are given. A
black-box access to an unknown subset $S \subseteq V$ is provided via queries
of the form `Does $i \in S$?'. We are interested in the minimum number of
queries needed in worst case in order to determine whether $G[S]$, the subgraph
of $G$ induced on $S$, satisfies $\mathcal{P}$.
  Apart from being combinatorially rich, this setting allows us to initiate a
systematic study of breaking symmetry in the context of query complexity of
graph properties. In particular, we focus on hereditary graph properties. The
monotone functions in the node-query setting translate precisely to the
hereditary graph properties. The famous Evasiveness Conjecture asserts that
even with a minimal symmetry assumption on $G$, namely that of
vertex-transitivity, the query complexity for any hereditary graph property in
our setting is the worst possible, i.e., $n$.
  We show that in the absence of any symmetry on $G$ it can fall as low as
$O(n^{1/(d + 1) })$ where $d$ denotes the minimum possible degree of a minimal
forbidden sub-graph for $\mathcal{P}$. In particular, every hereditary property
benefits at least quadratically. The main question left open is: can it go
exponentially low for some hereditary property?
  We show that the answer is no for any hereditary property with {finitely

the number $N$ of degrees of freedom become large and focus upon collective
observables. Mean-field quantities scaling as $1/N$ tend to commute, whence
complexity at the quantum level can only be inherited from complexity at the
classical level. Instead, fluctuations of microscopic observables scale as
$1/\sqrt{N}$ and exhibit collective Bosonic features, typical of a mesoscopic
regime half-way between the quantum one at the microscopic level and the
classical one at the level of macroscopic averages. Here, we consider the
mesoscopic behaviour emerging from an infinite quantum spin chain undergoing a
microscopic dissipative, irreversible dynamics and from global states without
long-range correlations and invariant under lattice translations and dynamics.
We show that, from the fluctuations of one site spin observables whose linear
span is mapped into itself by the dynamics, there emerge bosonic operators
obeying a mesoscopic dissipative dynamics mapping Gaussian states into Gaussian
states. Instead of just depleting quantum correlations because of decoherence
effects, these maps can generate entanglement at the collective, mesoscopic
level, a phenomenon with no classical analogue that embodies a peculiar complex
behaviour at the interface between micro and macro regimes.

determined to maximize the retailer's profit (upper level problem). The

a bilevel optimization problem. To overcome the weakness and infeasibility of
conventional Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) approach for this particular type of

multi-population genetic algorithms for the upper level problem and distributed
individual optimization algorithms for the lower level problem, is proposed.

find that (i) as predicted, there is a peak near i_m~40 deg in the distribution

signal-to-noise optical spectroscopy. The advent of a new generation of high
resolution near-IR spectrographs opens the possibility of using classic
spectroscopic methods with high resolution and high signal-to-noise in the NIR
spectral window. Aims: We aim to compile a new iron line list in the NIR from a
solar spectrum to derive precise stellar atmospheric parameters, comparable to
the ones already obtained from high resolution optical spectra. The spectral
range covers 10 000 {\AA} to 25 000 {\AA}, which is equivalent to the Y, J, H,
and K bands. Methods: Our spectroscopic analysis is based on the iron
excitation and ionization balance done in LTE. We use a high resolution and
high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the Sun from the Kitt Peak telescope as
a starting point to compile the iron line list. The oscillator strengths (log
gf) of the iron lines were calibrated for the Sun. The abundance analysis was
done using the MOOG code after measuring equivalent widths of 357 solar iron
lines. Results: We successfully derived stellar atmospheric parameters for the
Sun. Furthermore, we analysed HD20010, a F8IV star, from which we derived
stellar atmospheric parameters using the same line list as for the Sun. The
spectrum was obtained from the CRIRES- POP database. The results are compatible
with the ones found in the literature, confirming the reliability of our line
list. However, due to the quality of the data we obtain large errors.

the order of 10--30~km~s$^{-1}$, respectively, i.e., they are considerably
smaller than free fall velocities. These cold blobs contain a mixture of
ionized and neutral material that must be dynamically coupled in order to fall
together, as observed. We investigate this coupling by means of hydrodynamic
simulations in which the coupling arises from the friction between ions and
neutrals. The numerical simulations presented here are an extension of those of
\citet{oliver2014} to the partially ionized case. We find that, although the
relative drift speed between the two species is smaller than 1~m~s$^{-1}$ at
the blob center, it is sufficient to produce the forces required to strongly
couple charged particles and neutrals. The ionization degree has no discernible
effect on the main results of our previous work for a fully ionized plasma: the
condensation has an initial acceleration phase followed by a period with
roughly constant velocity and, in addition, the maximum descending speed is
clearly correlated with the ratio of initial blob to environment density.

foundation for homotopy probability theory by establishing its basic principles
and practices. The notion of a homotopy probability space is an enrichment of
the notion of an algebraic probability space with ideas from algebraic homotopy
theory. This enrichment uses a characterization of the laws of random variables
in a probability space in terms of symmetries of the expectation. The laws of
random variables are reinterpreted as invariants of the homotopy types of
infinity morphisms between certain homotopy algebras. The relevant category of
homotopy algebras is determined by the appropriate notion of independence for
the underlying probability theory. This theory will be both a natural
generalization and an effective computational tool for the study of classical
algebraic probability spaces, while keeping the same central limit. This
article is focused on the commutative case, where the laws of random variables
are also described in terms of certain affinely flat structures on the formal
moduli space of a naturally defined family attached to the given algebraic
probability space. Non-commutative probability theories will be the main
subject of the sequels.
  (This work is a spin-off from the author's program to characterize path
integrals of quantum field theory in terms of the symmetries of the quantum
expectation which should satisfy a certain coherence with a particular weight
filtration generated by the Planck constant $\hbar$. A similar idea is adopted
here in a simplified form, without the $\hbar$-conditions, and, in return, many
results in this paper will be used as background materials in the forthcoming
work on homotopy theory of quantum fields).

interrelated with its computational capacity. Empirical data analyzed here
indicate a certain hierarchy in local cortical composition. Specifically,
neural wire, i.e., axons and dendrites take each about 1/3 of cortical space,
spines and glia/astrocytes occupy each about $(1/3)^{2}$, and capillaries
around $(1/3)^{4}$. Moreover, data analysis across species reveals that these
fractions are roughly brain size independent, which suggests that they could be
in some sense optimal and thus important for brain function. Is there any
principle that sets them in this invariant way? This study first builds a model
of local circuit in which neural wire, spines, astrocytes, and capillaries are
mutually coupled elements and are treated within a single mathematical
framework. Next, various forms of wire minimization rule (wire length, surface
area, volume, or conduction delays) are analyzed, of which, only minimization
of wire volume provides realistic results that are very close to the empirical
cortical fractions. As an alternative, a new principle called ""spine economy
maximization"" is proposed and investigated, which is associated with
maximization of spine proportion in the cortex per spine size that yields
equally good but more robust results. Additionally, a combination of wire cost
and spine economy notions is considered as a meta-principle, and it is found
that this proposition gives only marginally better results than either pure
wire volume minimization or pure spine economy maximization, but only if spine
economy component dominates. In sum, these results suggest that the new spine
economy principle may be important for brain evolutionary design in a broader

transfer of complex baseband signals to and from a central unit (CU) over
digital fronthaul links to enable the virtualization of the baseband processing
functionalities of distributed radio units (RUs). The standard design of
digital fronthauling is based on either scalar quantization or on more
sophisticated point to-point compression techniques operating on baseband
signals. Motivated by network-information theoretic results, techniques for
fronthaul quantization and compression that improve over point-to-point
solutions by allowing for joint processing across multiple fronthaul links at
the CU have been recently proposed for both the uplink and the downlink. For
the downlink, a form of joint compression, known in network information theory
as multivariate compression, was shown to be advantageous under a
non-constructive asymptotic information-theoretic framework. In this paper,
instead, the design of a practical symbol-by-symbol fronthaul quantization
algorithm that implements the idea of multivariate compression is investigated
for the C-RAN downlink. As compared to current standards, the proposed
multivariate quantization (MQ) only requires changes in the CU processing while
no modification is needed at the RUs. The algorithm is extended to enable the
joint optimization of downlink precoding and quantization, reduced-complexity
MQ via successive block quantization, and variable-length compression.
Numerical results, which include performance evaluations over standard cellular
models, demonstrate the advantages of MQ and the merits of a joint optimization
with precoding.

of ionization cooling to evaluate the feasibility of the technique. To carry
out this program, MICE requires an efficient particle-identification (PID)
system to identify muons. The Electron-Muon Ranger (EMR) is a fully-active
tracking-calorimeter that forms part of the PID system and tags muons that
traverse the cooling channel without decaying. The detector is capable of
identifying electrons with an efficiency of 98.6%, providing a purity for the
MICE beam that exceeds 99.8%. The EMR also proved to be a powerful tool for the
reconstruction of muon momenta in the range 100-280 MeV/$c$.

an out-of-plane energy term. This novel potential is developed from density
functional theory (DFT) calculations for small numbers of atoms, and can be
used for configurations with millions of atoms. Our simulations show that
buckling caused by typical defects such as the Stone-Wales (SW) defect extends
to hundreds of nanometers. Surprisingly, this long-range relaxation lowers the
defect formation energy dramatically - by a factor of $2$ or $3$ - implying
that previously published DFT-calculated defect formation energies suffer from
large systematic errors. We also show the applicability of the novel potential
to other long-range defects including line dislocations and grain boundaries,
all of which exhibit pronounced out-of-plane relaxations. We show that the
energy as a function of dislocation separation diverges logarithmically for
flat graphene, but converges to a constant for free standing buckled graphene.
A potential in which the atoms are attracted to the 2D plane restores the
logarithmic behaviour of the energy. Future simulations employing this
potential will elucidate the influence of the typical long-range buckling and
rippling on the physical properties of graphene.

a steep cost for realizing the full imaging potential of these powerful

Correlator (EPIC), we present the first software demonstration of a generalized
direct imaging algorithm, namely, the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF)
imager. Not only does it bring down the cost for dense layouts to
$\mathcal{O}(N_\textrm{A}\log_2 N_\textrm{A})$ but can also image from
irregular layouts and heterogeneous arrays of antennas. EPIC is highly modular,
parallelizable, implemented in object-oriented Python, and publicly available.
We have verified the images produced to be equivalent to those from traditional
techniques to within a precision set by gridding coarseness. We have also
validated our implementation on data observed with the Long Wavelength Array

Antenna layouts with dense filling factors consisting of a large number of

gain significant computational advantage by deploying an optimized version of

Accurate photometry with ground based solar telescopes requires
characterization of straylight. Scattering in Earth's atmosphere and in the
telescope optics are potentially significant sources of straylight, for which
the point spread function (PSF) has wings that reach very far. This kind of
straylight produces an aureola, extending several solar radii off the solar
disk. Aims. We want to measure such straylight using the ordinary science
instrumentation. Methods. We scanned the intensity on and far off the solar
disk by use of the science cameras in several different wavelength bands on a
day with low-dust conditions. We characterized the far wing straylight by
fitting a model to the recorded intensities involving a multi-component
straylight PSF and the limb darkening of the disk. Results. The measured
scattered light adds an approximately constant fraction of the local
granulation intensity to science images at any position on the disk. The
fraction varied over the day but never exceeded a few percent. The PSFs have
weak tails that extend to several solar radii but most of the scattered light
originates within ~1'. Conclusions. Far-wing scattered light contributes only a
small amount of straylight in SST data. Other sources of straylight are
primarily responsible for the reduced contrast in SST images.

We prove that the formulation yields price distortions that are bounded by the

that when the price distortions are zero, day-ahead quantities converge to the
quantile of real-time counterparts. The undesired effects of price distortions
suggest that stochastic settings provide significant benefits over
deterministic ones that go beyond social surplus improvements. We propose
additional metrics to evaluate these benefits.

BFGS (LBFGS), a common subproblem is a line search minimizing the loss function
along a descent direction. Commonly used line searches iteratively find an
approximate solution for which the Wolfe conditions are satisfied, typically
requiring multiple function and gradient evaluations per line search, which is
expensive in parallel due to communication requirements. In this paper we
propose a new line search approach for cases where the loss function is
analytic, as in least squares regression, logistic regression, or low rank
matrix factorization. We approximate the loss function by a truncated Taylor
polynomial, whose coefficients may be computed efficiently in parallel with
less communication than evaluating the gradient, after which this polynomial
may be minimized with high accuracy in a neighbourhood of the expansion point.
Our Polynomial Expansion Line Search (PELS) was implemented in the Apache Spark
framework and used to accelerate the training of a logistic regression model on
binary classification datasets from the LIBSVM repository with LBFGS and the
Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (NCG) method. In large-scale numerical experiments
in parallel on a 16-node cluster with 256 cores using the URL, KDDA, and KDDB
datasets, the PELS approach produced significant convergence improvements
compared to the use of classical Wolfe line searches. For example, to reach the
final training label prediction accuracies, LBFGS using PELS had speedup
factors of 1.8--2 over LBFGS using a Wolfe line search, measured by both the
number of iterations and the time required, due to the better accuracy of step
sizes computed in the line search. PELS has the potential to significantly
accelerate large-scale regression and factorization computations, and is
applicable to continuous optimization problems with smooth loss functions.

carried out a calibration of the main shock parameters (the shock formation
radius and the effective adiabatic index) using the circumstellar HCN
abundances recently measured for a populous sample of pulsating TP-AGB stars.
Our models recover the range of the observed HCN concentrations as a function
of the mass-loss rates, and successfully reproduce the systematic increase of
HCN moving along the M-S-C chemical sequence of TP-AGB stars, that traces the
increase of the surface C/O ratio. The chemical calibration brings along two
important implications: i) the first shock should emerge very close to the
photosphere, and ii) shocks are expected to have a dominant isothermal
character in the denser region close to the star (within ~ 3-4 R), implying
that radiative processes should be quite efficient. Our analysis also suggests
that the HCN concentrations in the inner circumstellar envelopes are critically
affected by the H-H2 chemistry during the post-shock relaxation stages.

$\phi(T)$ for every $\phi\in \Phi$, then $\overline\Omega$ is complete
$K$-spectral for $T$ for some constant $K$. In particular, we prove that under
a geometric transversality condition, the intersection of finitely many
$K'$-spectral sets for $T$ is again $K$-spectral for some $K\ge K'$. These
theorems generalize and complement results by Mascioni, Stessin, Stampfli,
Badea-Beckerman-Crouzeix and others. We also extend to non-convex domains a
result by Putinar and Sandberg on the existence of a skew dilation of $T$ to a
normal operator with spectrum in $\partial\Omega$. As a key tool, we use the
results from our previous paper on traces of analytic uniform algebras.

propagation of the electron correlation effects to elucidate their roles for
accurate evaluations of the matrix elements. We also demonstrate contributions
explicitly from the Dirac-Coulomb interactions, frequency independent Breit

Uncertainties to these matrix elements due to different possible sources of
errors are estimated. By combining our calculated radiative matrix elements
with the experimental values of the transition wavelengths, we obtain the
transition probabilities due to both the allowed and lower order forbidden

inconsistencies between the earlier theoretical calculations and the

given only quantum black box access, into one of several classes without
necessarily determining the entire function. Generally, QOC captures a very
wide range of problems in quantum query complexity. However, relatively little
is known about many of these problems.
  In this work, we analyze the a subclass of the QOC problems where there is a
group structure. That is, suppose the range of the unknown function A is a
commutative group G, which induces a commutative group law over the entire
function space. Then we consider the case where A is drawn uniformly at random
from some subgroup A of the function space. Moreover, there is a homomorpism f
on A, and the goal is to determine f(A). This class of problems is very
general, and covers several interesting cases, such as oracle evaluation;
polynomial interpolation, evaluation, and extrapolation; and parity. These
problems are important in the study of message authentication codes in the
quantum setting, and may have other applications.
  We exactly characterize the quantum query complexity of every instance of QOC
with group structure in terms of a particular counting problem. That is, we
provide an algorithm for this general class of problems whose success
probability is determined by the solution to the counting problem, and prove
its exact optimality. Unfortunately, solving this counting problem in general
is a non-trivial task, and we resort to analyzing special cases. Our bounds
unify some existing results, such as the existing oracle evaluation and parity
bounds. In the case of polynomial interpolation and evaluation, our bounds give
new results for secret sharing and information theoretic message authentication
codes in the quantum setting.

describe thermogravitational cycles which have the same efficiencies as the
Carnot, Rankine or Brayton cycles. Considering a working fluid, enclosed in a
balloon, inside a column filled with a transporting fluid, the cycle is
composed of four steps. Starting from the top of the column, the balloon goes
down by gravity, receives heat from a hot source at the bottom, rises and
delivers heat to a cold source at the top. Unlike classic power cycles which
need external work to operate the compressor, thermogravitational cycles can
operate as ""pure power cycle"" where no external work is provided to drive the
cycle. To illustrate this concept, the prototype of a thermogravitational
electrical generator is presented. It uses a hot source of low temperature
(average temperature near 57{\deg}C) and relies on the gravitational energy
exchanges of an organic fluorinated fluid inside a balloon attached to a
magnetic marble producing an electromotive force of 50 mV peak to peak by the
use of a linear alternator. This heat engine is well suited to be operated

spin-field coupling on the particle's trajectory in ultra-relativistic regime.
The Lagrangian with minimal spin-gravity interaction yields the equations
equivalent to the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD) equations of a
rotating body. We show that they have unsatisfactory behavior in the
ultra-relativistic limit. In particular, three-dimensional acceleration of the
particle increases with velocity and becomes infinite in the ultra-relativistic
limit. The reason is that in the equation for trajectory emerges the term which
can be thought as an effective metric generated by the minimal spin-gravity
coupling. Therefore we examine the non-minimal interaction through the
gravimagnetic moment $\kappa$, and show that the theory with $\kappa=1$ is free
of the problems detected in MPTD-equations. Hence the non-minimally interacting
theory seem more promising candidate for description of a relativistic rotating
body in general relativity.
  The Lagrangian for the particle in an arbitrary electromagnetic field in
Minkowski space leads to generalized Frenkel and Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi
equations. The particle with magnetic moment in electromagnetic field and the
particle with gravimagnetic moment in gravitational field have very similar
structure of equations of motion. In particular, the spin-electromagnetic
coupling also produces an effective metric for the particle with anomalous
magnetic moment. If we use the usual special-relativity notions for time and
distance, then the critical speed, which the particle cannot exceed during its
evolution in electromagnetic field, is different from the speed of light. This
can be corrected assuming that the three-dimensional geometry should be defined
with respect to the effective metric.

  should be (1-e_2^2)^2, and in Eq.14: (4+3e_1) should be (4+3 e_1^2). Thanks

dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes) with tertiary companions in hierarchical
triple systems. As the inner binary (with initially negligible eccentricity)
undergoes orbital decay due to gravitational radiation, its eccentricity can be
excited by gravitational forcing from the tertiary. This excitation occurs when
the triple system passes through an ""apsidal precession resonance"", when the
precession rate of the inner binary, driven by the gravitational perturbation
of the external companion and general relativity, matches the precession rate
of the outer binary. The eccentricity excitation requires the outer companion
to be on an eccentric orbit, with the mutual inclination between the inner and
outer orbits less than $\sim 40^\circ$. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from
the inner binary can be significantly modified as the system evolves through
the apsidal precession resonance. For some system parameters (e.g., a white
dwarf binary with a brown dwarf tertiary), the resonance can happen when the
binary emits GWs in the $10^{-4}-10^{-1}$~Hz range (the sensitivity band of
LISA).

Arabic roots are being utilized for many tasks; the process of extracting a
word root is referred to as stemming. Stemming is an essential part of most
Natural Language Processing tasks, especially for derivative languages such as
Arabic. However, stemming is faced with the problem of ambiguity, where two or
more roots could be extracted from the same word. On the other hand,
distributional semantics is a powerful co-occurrence model. It captures the
meaning of a word based on its context. In this paper, a distributional
semantics model utilizing Smoothed Pointwise Mutual Information (SPMI) is
constructed to investigate its effectiveness on the stemming analysis task. It
showed an accuracy of 81.5%, with a at least 9.4% improvement over other
stemmers.
