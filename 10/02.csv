processes. We compare two different approaches used for calculating cross
sections for two-photon $p p \to l^+ l^- X$ process. In one of the approaches
photon is treated as a collinear parton in the proton. In the second approach
recently proposed a $k_T$-factorization method is used. We discuss how results
of the collinear parton model depend on the initial condition for the QCD
evolution and discuss an approximate treatment where photon is excluded from
the combined QCD-QED evolution. We demonstrate that it is not necessary to put
photon into the evolution equation as often done recently but it is sufficient
to use a simplified approach in which photon couples to quarks and antiquarks
which by themselves undergo DGLAP evolution equations. We discuss sensitivity
of the results to the choice of structure function parametrization and
experimental cuts in the $k_T$-factorization approach. A new optimal structure
function parametrization is proposed. We compare results of our calculations
with recent experimental data for dilepton production and find that in most
cases the contribution of the photon-photon mechanism is rather small. We
discuss how to enhance the photon-photon contribution. We also compare our
results to those of recent measurements of exclusive and semi-exclusive $e^+
e^-$ pair production with certain experimental data by the CMS collaboration.

  Ascending Auction",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The simultaneous multiple-round auction (SMRA) and the combinatorial clock
auction (CCA) are the two primary mechanisms used to sell bandwidth. Under
truthful bidding, the SMRA is known to output a Walrasian equilibrium that
maximizes social welfare provided the bidder valuation functions satisfy the
gross substitutes property. Recently, it was shown that the combinatorial clock
auction (CCA) provides good welfare guarantees for general classes of valuation
functions. This motivates the question of whether similar welfare guarantees
hold for the SMRA in the case of general valuation functions.
  We show the answer is no. But we prove that good welfare guarantees still
arise if the degree of complementarities in the bidder valuations are bounded.
In particular, if bidder valuations functions are $\alpha$-near-submodular
then, under truthful bidding, the SMRA has a welfare ratio (the worst case
ratio between the social welfare of the optimal allocation and the auction
allocation) of at most $(1+\alpha)$. The special case of submodular valuations,
namely $\alpha=1$, and produces individually rational solutions. However, for
$\alpha>1$, this is a bicriteria guarantee, to obtain good welfare under
truthful bidding requires relaxing individual rationality.
  Finally, we examine what strategies are required to ensure individual
rationality in the SMRA with general valuation functions. First, we provide a
weak characterization, namely \emph{secure bidding}, for individual
rationality. We then show that if the bidders use a profit-maximizing secure
bidding strategy the welfare ratio is at most $1+\alpha$. Consequently, by
bidding securely, it is possible to obtain the same welfare guarantees as
truthful bidding without the loss of individual rationality.

  Transactions on Signal Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2016.2546233",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of selecting the best sampling set for bandlimited
reconstruction of signals on graphs. A frequency domain representation for
graph signals can be defined using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of
variation operators that take into account the underlying graph connectivity.
Smoothly varying signals defined on the nodes are of particular interest in
various applications, and tend to be approximately bandlimited in the frequency
basis. Sampling theory for graph signals deals with the problem of choosing the
best subset of nodes for reconstructing a bandlimited signal from its samples.
Most approaches to this problem require a computation of the frequency basis
(i.e., the eigenvectors of the variation operator), followed by a search
procedure using the basis elements. This can be impractical, in terms of
storage and time complexity, for real datasets involving very large graphs. We
circumvent this issue in our formulation by introducing quantities called graph
spectral proxies, defined using the powers of the variation operator, in order
to approximate the spectral content of graph signals. This allows us to
formulate a direct sampling set selection approach that does not require the
computation and storage of the basis elements. We show that our approach also
provides stable reconstruction when the samples are noisy or when the original
signal is only approximately bandlimited. Furthermore, the proposed approach is
valid for any choice of the variation operator, thereby covering a wide range
of graphs and applications. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various
numerical experiments.

covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), which link physically-based directions of
perturbations to growth/decay rates. The model is obtained via a severe
truncation of quasi-geostrophic equations for the two fluids, and includes a
simple yet physically meaningful representation of their
dynamical/thermodynamical coupling. The model has 36 degrees of freedom, and
the parameters are chosen so that a chaotic behaviour is observed. One finds
two positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs), sixteen negative LEs, and eighteen
near-zero LEs. The presence of many near-zero LEs results from the vast
time-scale separation between the characteristic time scales of the two fluids,
and leads to nontrivial error growth properties in the tangent space spanned by
the corresponding CLVs, which are geometrically very degenerate. Such CLVs
correspond to two different classes of ocean/atmosphere coupled modes. The
tangent space spanned by the CLVs corresponding to the positive and negative
LEs has, instead, a non-pathological behaviour, and one can construct robust
large deviations laws for the finite time LEs, thus providing a universal model
for assessing predictability on long to ultra-long scales along such
directions. It is somewhat surprising to find that the tangent space of the
unstable manifold has strong projection on both atmospheric and oceanic
components. Our results underline the difficulties in using hyperbolicity as a
conceptual framework for multiscale chaotic dynamical systems, whereas the
framework of partial hyperbolicity seems better suited, possibly indicating an
alternative definition for the chaotic hypothesis. Our results suggest the need
for accurate analysis of error dynamics on different time scales and domains
and for a careful set-up of assimilation schemes when looking at coupled
atmosphere-ocean models.

This requires the computation of precise and accurate theoretical frequencies,

errors. To overcome this problem, an empirical correction has been introduced
by Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L175) and is now commonly used for seismic
inferences. Nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing for
the quantification of the surface-effect corrections. We used a grid of these
simulations computed with the CO$^5$BOLD code to model the outer layers of
solar-like stars. Upper layers of the corresponding 1D standard models were
then replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3D models.
The frequency differences between these patched models and the 1D standard
models were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us to
constrain the Kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a Lorentzian formulation.
We find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly on
both the effective temperature and the surface gravity. We further provide the
variation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections using
their power law as well as a Lorentzian formulation. Scaling relations between
these parameters and the elevation (related to the Mach number) is also
provided. The Lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the whole
frequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequency
shifts in the frequency range above $\nu_{\rm max}$.

properties of graphene. By using advanced imaging techniques with
high-resolution transmission electron microscopes, we have measured the strain

sensitivity. These fields differ qualitatively from those given by conventional
linear elasticity. However, atom positions calculated from two dimensional (2D)
discrete elasticity and three dimensional discrete periodized F\""oppl-von
K\'arm\'an equations (dpFvKEs) yield fields close to experiments when
determined by geometric phase analysis. 2D theories produce symmetric fields
whereas those from experiments exhibit asymmetries. Numerical solutions of
dpFvKEs provide strain and rotation fields of dislocation dipoles and pairs
that also exhibit asymmetries and, compared with experiments, may yield
information on out-of-plane displacements of atoms. While discrete theories
need to be solved numerically, analytical formulas for strains and rotation
about dislocations can be obtained from 2D Mindlin's hyperstress theory. These
formulas are very useful for fitting experimental data and provide a template
to ascertain the importance of nonlinear and nonplanar effects. Measuring the
parameters of this theory, we find two characteristic lengths between three and
four times the lattice spacings that control dilatation and rotation about a
dislocation. At larger distances from the dislocation core, the elastic fields
decay to those of conventional elasticity. Our results may be relevant for
strain engineering in graphene and other 2D materials of current interest.

the overlap between momentum states and post-quench eigenstates and whether
these latter states are extended or localized. We find that the post-quench
momentum distribution directly reflects these overlaps. For the local density,
we show that disorder generically prevents the equilibration of quantum
expectation values to a steady state and that the persistent fluctuations have
a nonmonotonic dependence on the strength of disorder. We identify two distinct
types of fluctuations, namely, temporal fluctuations describing the
time-dependent fluctuations of the local density around its time average and
sample-to-sample fluctuations characterizing the variations of these time
averages from one realization of disorder to another. We demonstrate that both
of these fluctuations vanish for extremely extended as well as extremely
localized states, peaking at some intermediate value.

show from explicit solution of the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation that
for distances $z$ far from the interface, where the profile decays
exponentially, $S(z;q)$ splits unambiguously into bulk and interfacial
contributions. On each side of the interface, the interfacial contributions can
be characterised by distinct liquid and gas wavevector dependent surface
tensions, $\sigma_l(q)$ and $\sigma_g(q)$, which are determined solely by the
$bulk$ two-body and three-body direct correlation functions. At high
temperatures, the wavevector dependence simplifies and is determined almost
entirely by the appropriate bulk structure factor, leading to positive rigidity
coefficients. Our predictions are confirmed by explicit calculation of $S(z;q)$
within square-gradient theory and the Sullivan model. The results for the
latter predict a striking temperature dependence for $\sigma_l(q)$ and
$\sigma_g(q)$, and have implications for fluctuation effects. Our results

close binary system, with an orbital period of 60.753$\pm$0.003 d. We observed
MWC 314 with a combination of optical spectroscopy, broad-band ground- and
space-based photometry, as well as with long baseline, near-infrared
interferometry. We have revised the single-lined spectroscopic orbit and
explored the photometric variability. The orbital light curve displays two
minima each orbit that can be partially explained in terms of the tidal
distortion of the primary that occurs around the time of periastron. The
emission lines in the system are often double-peaked and stationary in their
kinematics, indicative of a circumbinary disc. We find that the stellar wind or
circumbinary disc is partially resolved in the K\prime-band with the longest
baselines of the CHARA Array. From this analysis, we provide a simple,
qualitative model in an attempt to explain the observations. From the
assumption of Roche Lobe overflow and tidal synchronisation at periastron, we
estimate the component masses to be M1 $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ and M2$\approx 15$
M$_\odot$, which indicates a mass of the LBV that is extremely low. In addition
to the orbital modulation, we discovered two pulsational modes with the MOST
satellite. These modes are easily supported by a low-mass hydrogen-poor star,
but cannot be easily supported by a star with the parameters of an LBV. The
combination of these results provides evidence that the primary star was likely
never a normal LBV, but rather is the product of binary interactions. As such,
this system presents opportunities for studying mass-transfer and binary
evolution with many observational techniques.

e.g., visual, auditory, and haptic information, which can be observed by
performing actions on an object. However, performing many actions on a target
object requires a long time. In a real-time scenario, i.e., when the time is
limited, the robot has to determine the set of actions that is most effective
for recognizing a target object. We propose an MHDP-based active perception
method that uses the information gain (IG) maximization criterion and lazy
greedy algorithm. We show that the IG maximization criterion is optimal in the
sense that the criterion is equivalent to a minimization of the expected
Kullback--Leibler divergence between a final recognition state and the
recognition state after the next set of actions. However, a straightforward
calculation of IG is practically impossible. Therefore, we derive an efficient
Monte Carlo approximation method for IG by making use of a property of the
MHDP. We also show that the IG has submodular and non-decreasing properties as
a set function because of the structure of the graphical model of the MHDP.
Therefore, the IG maximization problem is reduced to a submodular maximization
problem. This means that greedy and lazy greedy algorithms are effective and
have a theoretical justification for their performance. We conducted an
experiment using an upper-torso humanoid robot and a second one using synthetic
data. The experimental results show that the method enables the robot to select
a set of actions that allow it to recognize target objects quickly and
accurately. The results support our theoretical outcomes.

placental carnivores and primates apparently follows species invariant
quantitative laws. Dynamical optimization models assuming that neurons
coordinate their stimulus preferences throughout cortical circuits linking
millions of cells specifically predict these invariants. This might indicate
that V1's intrinsic connectome and its functional architecture adhere to a
single optimization principle with high precision and robustness. To validate
this hypothesis, it is critical to closely examine the quantitative predictions
of alternative candidate theories. Random feedforward wiring within the
retino-cortical pathway represents a conceptually appealing alternative to
dynamical circuit optimization because random dimension-expanding projections
are believed to generically exhibit computationally favorable properties for
stimulus representations.
  Here, we ask whether the quantitative invariants of V1 architecture can be
explained as a generic emergent property of random wiring. We generalize and
examine the stochastic wiring model proposed by Ringach and coworkers, in which
iso-orientation domains in the visual cortex arise through random feedforward
connections between semi-regular mosaics of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and
visual cortical neurons. We derive closed-form expressions for cortical
receptive fields and domain layouts predicted by the model for perfectly
hexagonal RGC mosaics [...] We conclude that V1 layout invariants are specific
quantitative signatures of visual cortical optimization, which cannot be
explained by generic random feedforward-wiring models.

that, in a countable theory, any such relation restricted to the set of

stationary channels with time structure including the result by Kadota and
Wyner (1972) on continuous-time real-valued channels as special cases. As main
contribution the coding theorem is proved for a significantly weaker condition
on the channel output memory - called total ergodicity w.r.t. finite alphabet
block-memoryless input sources - and under a crucial relaxation of the
measurability requirement for the channel. These improvements are achieved by
introducing a suitable characterization of information rate capacity. It is
shown that the $\psi$-mixing output memory condition used by Kadota and Wyner
is quite restrictive and excludes important channel models, in particular for
the class of Gaussian channels. In fact, it is proved that for Gaussian (e.g.,
fading or additive noise) channels the $\psi$-mixing condition is equivalent to
finite output memory. Further, it is demonstrated that the measurability
requirement of Kadota and Wyner is not satisfied for relevant continuous-time
channel models such as linear filters, whereas the condition used in this paper
is satisfied for these models. Moreover, a weak converse is derived for all
stationary channels with time structure. Intersymbol interference as well as
input constraints are taken into account in a general and flexible way,
including amplitude and average power constraints as special case. Formulated
in rigorous mathematical terms complete, explicit, and transparent proofs are
presented. As a side product a gap in the proof of Kadota and Wyner -
illustrated by a counterexample - is closed by providing a corrected proof of a
lemma on the monotonicity of some sequence of normalized mutual information
quantities. An abstract framework is established to treat discrete- and

MIMO multi-way relay channel that consists of K users, where each user is
equipped with M antennas, and a decode-and-forward relay equipped with N
antennas. In this channel, each user wants to convey K-1 private messages to
the other users in addition to a common message to all of them. Due to the
absence of direct links between the users, communication occurs through the
relay in two phases; a multiple access channel phase (MAC) and a broadcast (BC)
phase. We drive cut-set bounds on the total DoF of the network, and show that
the network has DoF less than or equal to K min(N,M). Achievability of the
upper bound is shown by using signal space alignment for network coding in the
MAC phase, and zero-forcing precoding in the BC phase. We show that introducing
the common messages besides the private messages leads to achieving higher
total DoF than using the private messages only.

electron gas are calculated from quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature
and density as functions of temperature, chemical potential, frequency, and
wavevector. The polarization and the magnetization depend linearly on both
electric and magnetic fields, and are the sum of a zero-temperature and
zero-density vacuum part with a temperature- and chemical potential-dependent
medium part. Analytic calculations lead to generalized expressions that depend
on three scalar functions. In the nonrelativistic limit, results reproduce the
Lindhard formula. In the relativistic case, and in the long wavelength limit,
we obtain: i) for $\omega=0$, generalized susceptibilities that reduce to known
nonrelativistic limits; ii) for $\omega \neq 0$, Drude-type responses at zero
and at high temperatures. The latter implies that one may have both $\epsilon$
and $\mu$ simultaneously negative, a behavior characteristic of metamaterials.
This unambiguously indicates that the relativistic electron plasma is one of
nature's candidates for the realization of a negative index of refraction
system. Moreover, Maxwell's equations in the medium yield the dispersion
relation and the index of refraction of the electron plasma. Present results
should be relevant for plasma physics, astrophysical observations,
synchrotrons, and other environments with fast moving electrons.

detected only at HV, clearly associated with the compact north-south outflows
traced by extremely HV low-J CO. The mass-loss rate and energetics of derived

outflows in G5.89--0.39 are driven by the jet system seen in [OI]. The far-IR

to the cooling in the outflow. Our study shows the importance of
spectroscopically resolved data of [OI]63micron for using this line as
diagnostic of SFRs. While this was not possible until now, the GREAT receiver
onboard SOFIA has recently opened the possibility of detailed studies of this

operators that include derivatives. For sufficiently low-derivative operators,
we find an algorithm that gives the number of invariant operators, properly
accounting for redundancies due to the equations of motion and integration by
parts. Specifically, the technique can be applied whenever there is only one
Lorentz invariant for a given partitioning of derivatives among the fields. At
higher numbers of derivatives, equation of motion redundancies can be removed,
but the increased number of Lorentz contractions spoils the subtraction of
integration by parts redundancies. While restricted, this technique is
sufficient to automatically generate the complete set of invariant operators of
the Standard Model effective field theory for dimensions 6 and 7 (for arbitrary
numbers of flavors). At dimension 8, the algorithm does not automatically
generate the complete operator set; however, it suffices for all but five
classes of operators. For these remaining classes, there is a well defined
procedure to manually determine the number of invariants. Using these methods,
we thereby derive the set of 535 dimension-8 $N_f = 1$ operators.

optical lattice with negative effective tunneling energies paves the way to
study frustrated systems in a controlled environment. Here, we explore the
critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in such a frustrated lattice
in three dimensions. We represent the low-energy action of the lattice system
as a two-component Bose gas corresponding to the two minima of the dispersion.
The contact repulsion between the bosons separates into intra- and
inter-component interactions, referred to as $V_{0}$ and $V_{12}$,
respectively. We first employ a Huang-Yang-Luttinger approximation of the free
energy. For $V_{12}/V_{0} = 2$, which corresponds to the bare interaction, this
approach suggests a first order phase transition, at which both the U$(1)$
symmetry of condensation and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the emergent chiral
order are broken simultaneously. Furthermore, we perform a renormalization
group calculation at one-loop order. We demonstrate that the coupling regime
$0<V_{12}/V_0\leq1$ shares the critical behavior of the Heisenberg fixed point
at $V_{12}/V_{0}=1$. For $V_{12}/V_0>1$ we show that $V_{0}$ flows to a
negative value, while $V_{12}$ increases and remains positive. This results in
a breakdown of the effective quartic field theory due to a cubic anisotropy,
and again suggests a discontinuous phase transition.

both the IAU HG model and the Hapke model are consistent with a flat and
featureless spectrum of Ceres, although the values are ~10% higher than
previous measurements. Our models also suggest a wavelength dependence of
Ceres' phase function. The IAU G-parameter and the Hapke single-particle phase
function parameter, g, are both consistent with decreasing (shallower) phase
slope with increasing wavelength. Such a wavelength dependence of phase
function is consistent with reddening of spectral slope with increasing phase
angle, or phase-reddening. This phase reddening is consistent with previous
spectra of Ceres obtained at various phase angles archived in the literature,
and consistent with the fact that the modeled geometric albedo spectrum of
Ceres is the bluest of all spectra because it represents the spectrum at 0

study the luminosity functions (LF) and the dependence of the specific star
formation rate (SSFR) on stellar mass, galaxy type, and projected distance to
the groups that define the filaments. We find that the LF of galaxies in
filaments and in the isotropic infalling region are basically indistinguishable
between them, with the possible exception of late-type galaxies. On the other
hard, regardless of galaxy type, their LFs are clearly different from that of
field or group galaxies. Both of them have characteristic absolute magnitudes
and faint end slopes in between the field and group values. More significant
differences between galaxies in filaments and in the isotropic infall region
are observed when we analyse the SSFR. We find that galaxies in filaments have
a systematically higher fraction of galaxies with low SSFR as a function of

pattern in previous measurements. In the two-point correlation function (2PCF),
they appear to be strongly clustered on small-scales, indicating a tendency to
reside in massive haloes as satellite galaxies. However, their weak clustering
on large scales suggests that they are more likely to be found in low mass
haloes. The interpretation of the clustering pattern suffers from the large
sample variance in the 2PCF measurements, given the small volume of the
volume-limited sample of such faint galaxies. We introduce a method to improve
the clustering measurements of faint galaxies by making a full use of a
flux-limited sample to obtain volume-limited measurements with an increased
effective volume. In the improved 2PCF measurements, the fractional
uncertainties on large-scales drop by more than 40 per cent, and the strong
contrast between small-scale and large-scale clustering amplitudes seen in
previous work is no longer prominent. From halo occupation distribution
modelling of the measurements, we find that a considerable fraction of faint
red galaxies to be satellites in massive haloes, a senario supported by the
strong covariance of small-scale 2PCF measurements and the relative spatial
distribution of faint red galaxies and luminous galaxies. However, the
satellite fraction is found to be degenerate with the slope of the distribution
profile of satellites in inner haloes. We compare the modelling results with
semi-analytic model predictions and discuss the implications.

GI-induced arms at NIR wavelengths can reach a factor of ~3, and their pitch
angles are about 10-15 degree. The dominant azimuthal wavenumber of GI-induced
spiral arms roughly obeys m~1/q in the range 2<~1/q<~8. In particular, a
massive disk with q~0.5 can exhibit grand-design m=2 spirals. GI-induced arms
are in approximate corotation with the local disk, and may therefore trap dust
particles by pressure drag. Although GI can produce NIR spiral arms with
morphologies, contrasts, and pitch angles similar to those reported in recent
observations, it also makes other demands that may or may not be satisfied in

saturating the upper fine-structure transition state at gas temperatures above

greenhouse gas emissions, their uncoordinated charging could have adverse
effects on power system operation. Nevertheless, the task of optimal electric
vehicle charging scales unfavorably with the fleet size and the number of
control periods, especially when distribution grid limitations are enforced. To
this end, vehicle charging is first tackled using the recently revived
Frank-Wolfe method. The novel decentralized charging protocol has minimal
computational requirements from vehicle controllers, enjoys provable
acceleration over existing alternatives, enhances the security of the pricing
mechanism against data attacks, and protects user privacy. To comply with
voltage limits, a network-constrained EV charging problem is subsequently
formulated. Leveraging a linearized model for unbalanced distribution grids,
the goal is to minimize the power supply cost while respecting critical voltage
regulation and substation capacity limitations. Optimizing variables across
grid nodes is accomplished by exchanging information only between neighboring
buses via the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical tests
corroborate the optimality and efficiency of the novel schemes.

sub-millimetre emission and optical scattered light. These structures can be
the result of planet(s) or companions embedded in the disk.
  Aims. We aim to detect and analyse the scattered light of the transition disk
J160421.7-213028, identify disk structures, and compare the results with
previous observations of this disk at other wavelengths.
  Methods. We obtained and analysed new polarised intensity observations of the
transition disk J160421.7-213028 with VLT/SPHERE using the visible light
instrument ZIMPOL at $R'$ band (0.626$\mu$m). We probe the disk gap down to a
radius of confidence of 0.1'' (${\sim}15$ AU at 145 pc). We interpret the
results in the context of dust evolution when planets interact with the
parental disk.
  Results. We observe a gap from 0.1 to 0.3'' (${\sim}15$ to 40AU) and a bright
annulus as previously detected by HiCIAO $H$ band observations at $1.65\mu$m.
The radial width of the annulus is around $40$AU, and its centre is at
${\sim}61$AU from the central star. The peak of the reflected light at
0.626$\mu$m is located 20 AU inward of the cavity detected in the
submillimetre. In addition, we detect a dip at a position angle of ${\sim}46.2
\pm 5.4^\circ$. A dip was also detected with HiCIAO, but located at
${\sim}85^\circ$. If the dip observed with HiCIAO is the same, this suggests an
average dip rotation of ${\sim}12^\circ/$year, which is inconsistent with the
local Keplerian angular velocity of $\sim$0.8$^\circ$/yr at $\sim$61AU.
  Conclusions. The spatial discrepancy in the radial emission in
J160421.7-213028 at different wavelengths is consistent with dust filtration at
the outer edge of a gap carved by a massive planet. The dip rotation can be
interpreted by fast variability of the inner disk and/or the presence of a warp
or circumplanetary material of a planet at ${\sim}9.6$ AU.

this framework then becomes an intermediate step, pointing us toward the next

the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) could play in this context,

minimum in brightness, however, V1184 Tau is rather similar to UX Orionis
objects. The deep drop in brightness began in 2003 ended in 2015 as the star
has returned to maximum light. The light curve during the drop is obviously
asymmetric as the decrease in brightness lasts two times longer than the rise.
The observed colour reverse on the colour-magnitude diagrams is also

into a box with hard walls and preparing it in a special initial state. We
show, by solving the nonstationary problem of a free particle in a 1D hard-wall

expected back-and-forth motion of a free particle moving in a confined space.
Under suitable conditions, the state of the whole gas can then be made to recur

introduce this problem here as a modern instance of the discussions giving rise

the initial state observed [T. Kinoshita et al, Nature 440, 900 (2006)] in
trapped 1D Bose gases of cold atoms, for which our estimated recurrence time is
in fair agreement with the period of the oscillations observed; but this

which are long thought to be a possible candidate to explain the influence of
weak magnetic fields on living organisms ranging from magnetotactic bacteria to
fishes, birds, rats, bats and other mammals including humans. The core of the
model is provided by a short chain of magnetosomes serving as a sensor which is
coupled by elastic linkers to the gating elements of ion channels forming a
small cluster in the cell membrane. The magnetic sensor is fixed by one end on
cytoskeleton elements attached to the membrane and is exposed to viscoelastic
cytosol. Its free end can reorient stochastically and subdiffusively in
viscoelastic cytosol responding to external magnetic field changes and open the
gates of coupled ion channels. The sensor dynamics is generally bistable due to
bistability of the gates which can be in two states with probabilities which
depend on the sensor orientation. For realistic parameters, it is shown that
this model channel can operate in the magnetic field of Earth for a small
number (5 to 7) of single-domain magnetosomes constituting the sensor rod each
of which has a typical size found in magnetotactic bacteria and other
organisms, or even just one sufficiently large nanoparticle of a characteristic
size also found in nature. It is shown that due to viscoelasticity of medium
the bistable gating dynamics generally exhibits power law and stretched
exponential distributions of the residence times of the channels in their open
and closed states. This provides a generic physical mechanism for explanation
of the origin of such anomalous kinetics for other ionic channels whose sensors
move in viscoelastic environment provided by either cytosol or biological
membrane, in a quite general context, beyond the fascinating hypothesis of

paramagnetic at any positive temperature as already reported in some previous
studies. We also examine random directed graphs and show that contrary to
undirected ones, percolation of directed bonds does not guarantee ferromagnetic
ordering. Only above a certain threshold a random directed graph can support
finite-temperature ferromagnetic ordering. Such behaviour is found also for
out-homogeneous random graphs, but in this case the analysis of magnetic and
percolative properties can be done exactly. Directed random graphs also differ
from undirected ones with respect to zero-temperature freezing. Only at low
connectivity they remain trapped in a disordered configuration. Above a certain
threshold, however, the zero-temperature dynamics quickly drives the model
toward a broken symmetry (magnetized) state. Only above this threshold, which
is almost twice as large as the percolation threshold, we expect the Ising
model to have a positive critical temperature. With a very good accuracy, the
behaviour on directed random graphs is reproduced within a certain approximate

if a more realistic synaptic coupling mechanism is used in this class of
models, then a bifurcation or transition to an abnormal brain state does not
occur in the same parameter space. We show that the more realistic coupling has
additional mathematical parameters that require a fundamentally different

We found one of these, IRS 7, to be variable with a period of 37.14 +/- 0.04
days and an amplitude of approximately 2 mag in the Ks band. The light curve
consists of a quiescent phase with little or no variation, and a rapid outburst

light echoes that propagate into the surrounding molecular cloud, allowing a
measurement of the distance to IRS 7 of 404 pc +/- 35 pc. We observed only a
marginally significant change in the H - K color during the outburst phase. The
K-band spectrum of IRS 7 shows CO bandhead emission but its equivalent width
does not change significantly with the phase of the light curve. The H_2 1-0

also used the imaging data for a proper motion study of the outflows

when sampling around phase transitions, or when a few hard-to-find
configurations dominate the statistical averages. We introduce a generalized RE

challenges. The key feature of our approach is to inform the simulation with
readily available, but commonly unused, information on the the density of

improvements, namely, the introduction of resampling moves that actively move
the system towards equilibrium, and the continual adaptation of the optimal

configuration flow in temperature space is optimized and that the overall
convergence of RE simulations can be dramatically accelerated.

popular architectures to emulate the brain. In SNN, information is temporally

In such networks, spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms require the
online programming of synapses based on the temporal information of spikes
transmitted by spiking neurons. In this work, we propose a spintronic synapse
with decoupled spike transmission and programming current paths. The spintronic
synapse consists of a ferromagnet-heavy metal heterostructure where programming
current through the heavy metal generates spin-orbit torque to modulate the
device conductance. Low programming energy and fast programming times
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed device as a nanoelectronic synapse. We
perform a simulation study based on an experimentally benchmarked
device-simulation framework to demonstrate the interfacing of such spintronic
synapses with CMOS neurons and learning circuits operating in transistor
sub-threshold region to form a network of spiking neurons that can be utilized
for pattern recognition problems.

on the inner leg of its regular orbit swap with Epimetheus. During this period,
the edge exhibits a regular 7-lobed pattern with an amplitude of 12.8 km and
one minimum aligned with the orbital longitude of Janus, as has been found by
previous investigators. However, between 2010 and 2014, the Janus/Epimetheus
orbit swap moves the Janus 7:6 LR away from the A ring outer edge, and the
7-lobed pattern disappears. In addition to several smaller-amplitudes modes,
indeed, we found a variety of pattern speeds with different azimuthal wave
numbers, and many of them may arise from resonant cavities between the ILR and
the ring edge; also we found some other signatures consistent with tesseral

discovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light
curves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability
mechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability
supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up
to Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether
PISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light
curve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of
macroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting
observational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN
evolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova
evolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The
greatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an
extreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the
hydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of
chemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric
temperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider
range of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light
curves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two
well-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme
chemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore,
alternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still
to be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe.

states can emerge from a coupling between photons and excitons combined with a

We show that in photonic crystals the opening of the gap can be substantially
simplified close to photonic Dirac points. Coupling to Zeeman-split excitons
breaks time reversal symmetry and allows to gap out the Dirac cones in a
non-trival way, leading to a topological gap similar to the strength of the
periodic exciton potential. Compared to the original topolariton proposal

increases the size of the topological gap over a wide range of parameters.

scattering of transversely polarized electrons from unpolarized nuclei. The
asymmetry arises from the interference of the imaginary part of the two-photon
exchange with the one-photon exchange amplitude. The $Q_{\rm weak}$ experiment
has made the first measurement of $B_{\rm n}$ in the production of the
$\Delta$(1232) resonance, using the $Q_{\rm weak}$ apparatus in Hall-C at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The final transverse asymmetry,
corrected for backgrounds and beam polarization, is $B_{\rm n}$ = 43 $\pm$ 16
ppm at beam energy 1.16 GeV at an average scattering angle of about 8.3
degrees, and invariant mass of 1.2 GeV. The measured preliminary $B_{\rm n}$
agrees with a preliminary theoretical calculation. $B_{\rm n}$ for the $\Delta$
is the only known observable that is sensitive to the $\Delta$ elastic
form-factors ($\gamma$*$\Delta\Delta$) in addition to the generally studied
transition form-factors ($\gamma$*N$\Delta$), but extracting this information
will require significant theoretical input.

decompositions of the velocity fields in the Fourier space, which are similar
to the decomposition in large eddy simulations. It also uses a hierarchy of
local domains with different resolutions as in multigrid methods. The effective
diffusivity from finer scale is used for the next coarser level computation and
this process is repeated up to the coarsest scale of interest. The grids are
only in local domains whose sizes decrease depending on the resolution level so
that the overall computational complexity increases linearly as the number of
different resolution grids increases. The method captures interactions between
finer and coarser scales but has to sacrifice some of the interaction between
the fine scales. The proposed method is numerically tested with 2D examples
including a successful approximation to a continuous spectrum flow.

approach, vector and axial-vector mesons are implemented as gauge bosons of a
local chiral gauge group. We have previously shown that this model can describe
the experimentally measured vector and axial-vector spectral functions in
vacuum. Here, we carry the analysis to finite temperatures by evaluating medium
effects in a pion gas and calculating thermal spectral functions. We find that
the spectral peaks in both channels broaden along with a noticeable downward
mass shift in the a_1 spectral peak and negligible movement of the rho peak.
The approach toward spectral function degeneracy is accompanied by a reduction
of chiral order parameters, i.e., the pion decay constant and scalar
condensate. Our findings suggest a mechanism where the chiral mass splitting
induced in vacuum is burned off. We explore this mechanism and identify future

devices have been proposed to emulate biological synapses, spintronic devices
have proved to be efficient at performing the thresholding operation of the
neuron at ultra-low currents. In this work, we propose an All-Spin Artificial
Neural Network where a single spintronic device acts as the basic building
block of the system. The device offers a direct mapping to synapse and neuron
functionalities in the brain while inter-layer network communication is
accomplished via CMOS transistors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of a neural architecture where a single nanoelectronic
device is able to mimic both neurons and synapses. The ultra-low voltage
operation of low resistance magneto-metallic neurons enables the low-voltage
operation of the array of spintronic synapses, thereby leading to ultra-low
power neural architectures. Device-level simulations, calibrated to
experimental results, was used to drive the circuit and system level
simulations of the neural network for a standard pattern recognition problem.
Simulation studies indicate energy savings by ~ 100x in comparison to a
corresponding digital/ analog CMOS neuron implementation.

Procyon A, orbited in a 40.84 yr period by the faint DQZ white dwarf Procyon B.
Using images obtained over two decades with the Hubble Space Telescope, and
historical measurements back to the 19th century, we have determined precise
orbital elements. Combined with measurements of the parallax and the motion of
the A component, these elements yield dynamical masses of 1.478 +/- 0.012 Msun
and 0.592 +/- 0.006 Msun for A and B, respectively.
  The mass of Procyon A agrees well with theoretical predictions based on
asteroseismology and its temperature and luminosity. Use of a standard
core-overshoot model agrees best for a surprisingly high amount of core
overshoot. Under these modeling assumptions, Procyon A's age is ~2.7 Gyr.
  Procyon B's location in the H-R diagram is in excellent agreement with
theoretical cooling tracks for white dwarfs of its dynamical mass. Its position
in the mass-radius plane is also consistent with theory, assuming a
carbon-oxygen core and a helium-dominated atmosphere. Its progenitor's mass was
1.9-2.2 Msun, depending on its amount of core overshoot.
  Several astrophysical puzzles remain. In the progenitor system, the stars at
periastron were separated by only ~5 AU, which might have led to tidal
interactions and even mass transfer; yet there is no direct evidence that these
have occurred. Moreover the orbital eccentricity has remained high (~0.40). The
mass of Procyon B is somewhat lower than anticipated from the
initial-to-final-mass relation seen in open clusters. The presence of heavy
elements in its atmosphere requires ongoing accretion, but the place of origin
is uncertain.

Next K-means cluster analysis is applied on the independent components, to find
the optimum number of homogeneous groups having an underlying structure. The
properties of the four groups of globular clusters thus uncovered are used to
explain the formation mechanism of the host galaxy. It is suggested that M87
formed in two successive phases. First a monolithic collapse, which gave rise
to an inner group of metal-rich clusters with little systematic rotation and an
outer group of metal-poor clusters in eccentric orbits. In a second phase, the
galaxy accreted low-mass satellites in a dissipationless fashion, from the gas
of which the two other groups of globular clusters formed. Evidence is given
{\bf for a blue stellar population in the more metal rich clusters, which we
interpret by Helium enrichment.} Finally, it is found that the clusters of M87

two doublets (2HDM), where $U(1)$ and $Z_{2}$ symmetries are considered to
protect the $CP$ symmetry in the Higgs potential and to avoid Flavor Changing
Neutral Currents at tree level in the Yukawa sector. In the Inert Higgs Model
case, a detailed comparison is made between both models by using the energy
evolution of couplings, which should satisfy energy scale dependent relations
deduced for minima and stationary points of the Higgs potential at tree level.
Besides, perturbative unitarity constraints at tree level are considered to
generate the allowed parameter space compatible with perturbativity (absence of
Landau poles). Our studies illustrate exclusion regions for Higgs masses and
other combinations of couplings in the scalar sector, in particular for
splittings of mass square for neutral scalars $A^{0}$ and $H^{0}$, as well as
the difference between the sum of these and the charged Higgs mass square. From
the vacuum stability for inert-2HDM at the tree and one loop levels, analyses
lead us to find out new hierarchical structures for scalar masses. To complete
vacuum studies on the Inert model, and based on reparameterization invariance
of the Higgs potential, we compute original discriminants that allow ensuring
the presence of a global electroweak minimum at tree level. Moreover, the
behavior in high energy scales drives out analyzing criticality phenomena for
the additional parameters of extended Higgs sectors. Finally, and using the
consistency with the electroweak precision analyses of oblique parameters, we
describe several implications from different regimes of the inert model on
charged and pseudoscalar Higgs searches.

quasilinear viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation $\partial\_t u-\Delta\_p u+|\nabla

finite time when $2N/(N+1) \textless{} p \leq 2$ and $q\in(0,p-1)$. Further
properties of this extinction phenomenon are established herein:
\emph{instantaneous shrinking} of the support is shown to take place if the
initial condition $u\_0$ decays sufficiently rapidly as $|x|\to\infty$, that
is, for each $t \textgreater{} 0$, the positivity set of $u(t)$ is a bounded
subset of $\real^N$ even if $u\_0 \textgreater{} 0$ in $\real^N$. This decay
condition on $u\_0$ is also shown to be optimal by proving that the positivity
set of any solution emanating from a positive initial condition decaying at a
slower rate as $|x|\to\infty$ is the whole $\real^N$ for all times. The time
evolution of the positivity set is also studied: on the one hand, it is
included in a fixed ball for all times if it is initially bounded
(\emph{localization}). On the other hand, it converges to a single point at the
extinction time for a class of radially symmetric initial data, a phenomenon
referred to as \emph{single point extinction}. This behavior is in sharp
contrast with what happens when $q$ ranges in $[p-1,p/2)$ and $p\in

shrinking and single point extinction take place in particular for the

the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and
expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be
used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial
design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty
has its roots in both the Bayesian and the multi-objective optimization
literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle
objectives and constraints in a unified way, and a corresponding expected
hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion is
naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and
reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria---the classical Expected
Improvement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective
extensions---as soon as at least one feasible point is available. The
calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential
Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset
simulation method, which is well known in the field of structural reliability,
is used to estimate the criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian
Multi-Objective Optimization), is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for
single- and multi-objective constrained optimization.

when combined with appropriate regularizers, have been shown to be efficient at
performing this task. Sparse models with the 1-norm or low rank models with the
nuclear norm are examples of such successful combinations. Stable recovery
guarantees in these settings have been established using a common tool adapted
to each case: the notion of restricted isometry property (RIP). In this paper,
we establish generic RIP-based guarantees for the stable recovery of cones
(positively homogeneous model sets) with arbitrary regularizers. These
guarantees are illustrated on selected examples. For block structured sparsity
in the infinite dimensional setting, we use the guarantees for a family of
regularizers which efficiency in terms of RIP constant can be controlled,
leading to stronger and sharper guarantees than the state of the art.

System Objects (Gaia-FUN-SSO) play a key role in ensuring that moving objects
first detected by ESA's Gaia mission remain recoverable after their discovery.
An observation campaign on the potentially hazardous asteroid (99 942) Apophis
was conducted during the asteroid's latest period of visibility, from
12/21/2012 to 5/2/2013, to test the coordination and evaluate the overall
performance of the Gaia-FUN-SSO . The 2732 high quality astrometric
observations acquired during the Gaia-FUN-SSO campaign were reduced with the
Platform for Reduction of Astronomical Images Automatically (PRAIA), using the
USNO CCD Astrograph Catalogue 4 (UCAC4) as a reference. The astrometric
reduction process and the precision of the newly obtained measurements are
discussed. We compare the residuals of astrometric observations that we
obtained using this reduction process to data sets that were individually
reduced by observers and accepted by the Minor Planet Center. We obtained 2103
previously unpublished astrometric positions and provide these to the
scientific community. Using these data we show that our reduction of this
astrometric campaign with a reliable stellar catalog substantially improves the
quality of the astrometric results. We present evidence that the new data will
help to reduce the orbit uncertainty of Apophis during its close approach in
2029. We show that uncertainties due to geolocations of observing stations, as
well as rounding of astrometric data can introduce an unnecessary degradation
in the quality of the resulting astrometric positions. Finally, we discuss the
impact of our campaign reduction on the recovery process of newly discovered
asteroids.

sequence. We first adapt Landauer's lower bound, which relates the energy
variation of the environment $\mathcal{E}$ to a decrease of entropy of the
system $\mathcal{S}$ during the evolution, to the peculiar discrete time
dynamics of RIS. Then we consider RIS with a structured environment
$\mathcal{E}$ displaying small variations of order $T^{-1}$ between the
successive probes encountered by $\mathcal{S}$, after $n\simeq T$ interactions,
in keeping with adiabatic scaling. We establish a discrete time non-unitary
adiabatic theorem to approximate the reduced dynamics of $\mathcal{S}$ in this

that saturation of Landauer's bound is equivalent to a detailed balance
condition on the repeated interaction system, reflecting the non-equilibrium

in the cases of complex temperature or complex external field (Fisher and

we find an integral representation for the partition function which, in the
case $\lambda > 5$, reproduces the zeros for the Ising model on a complete

Fisher zeros impact onto the real temperature axis. This, in turn, gives access
to the $\lambda$-dependent universal values of the critical exponents and
critical amplitudes ratios. Our analysis of the Lee-Yang zeros reveals a
difference in their behaviour for the Ising model on a complete graph and on an

tendons based on the geometrical arrangement of their fibrils is derived. The
distribution of the crimp angles of the fibrils is used to determine the
stress-strain response of a single fascicle, and this stress-strain response is
used to determine the form of the strain energy function, the parameters of
which can all potentially be directly measured via experiments - unlike those
of commonly used strain energy functions such as the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden
(HGO) model, whose parameters are phenomenological. We compare the new model
with the HGO model and show that the new model gives a better match to existing
stress-strain data for human patellar tendon than the HGO model, with the
average relative error in matching this data when using the new model being
0.053 (compared with 0.57 when using the HGO model), and the average absolute
error when using the new model being 0.12 MPa (compared with 0.31 MPa when
using the HGO model).

distributions can be highly discriminative while being extremely efficient to
compute, which is in contrast to the models based on the global structure of
images. Motivated by such works, we propose to use higher-order statistics of
local non-binarized pixel patterns for the image description. The proposed
model does not require either (i) user specified quantization of the space (of
pixel patterns) or (ii) any heuristics for discarding low occupancy volumes of
the space. We propose to use a data driven soft quantization of the space, with
parametric mixture models, combined with higher-order statistics, based on
Fisher scores. We demonstrate that this leads to a more expressive
representation which, when combined with discriminatively learned classifiers
and metrics, achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging texture and
facial analysis datasets, in low complexity setup. Further, it is complementary
to higher complexity features and when combined with them improves performance.

that if $D$ is $s$-shellable for some $s\geq\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$, then
$D$ has at least $H(n)$ crossings. This is the first combinatorial condition on
a drawing that guarantees at least $H(n)$ crossings. In this work, we
generalize the concept of $s$-shellability to bishellability, where the former
implies the latter in the sense that every $s$-shellable drawing is, for any $b
\leq s-2$, also $b$-bishellable. Our main result is that $(\lfloor \frac{n}{2}
\rfloor\!-\!2)$-bishellability of a drawing $D$ of $K_n$ also guarantees, with
a simpler proof than for $s$-shellability, that $D$ has at least $H(n)$
crossings. We exhibit a drawing of $K_{11}$ that has $H(11)$ crossings, is
3-bishellable, and is not $s$-shellable for any $s\geq5$. This shows that we
have properly extended the class of drawings for which the Harary-Hill
Conjecture is proved. Moreover, we provide an infinite family of drawings of

often fitted by a procedure that maximizes the likelihood, such as the EM
algorithm. At convergence, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates are
typically reported, but in most cases little emphasis is placed on the
variability associated with these estimates. In part this may be due to the
fact that standard errors are not directly calculated in the model-fitting
algorithm, either because they are not required to fit the model, or because
they are difficult to compute. The examination of standard errors in
model-based clustering is therefore typically neglected. The widely used R
package mclust has recently introduced bootstrap and weighted likelihood
bootstrap methods to facilitate standard error estimation. This paper provides
an empirical comparison of these methods (along with the jackknife method) for
producing standard errors and confidence intervals for mixture parameters.
These methods are illustrated and contrasted in both a simulation study and in

multiple components of this union, as do the non-holomorphic maps. Each of the

early universe is examined. The model is based on a potential motivated by
symmetries being found in field theory at high energy. For various parameter
sets of the potential the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations that are
expected to originate from this scenario are calculated. Also the beginning of
the reheating epoch connecting the second inflation with thermal equilibrium is
studied. Perturbations with wavelengths leaving the horizon around the
transition between the two inflations are special: It is demonstrated that the
power spectrum at such scales deviates significantly from expectations based on
measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This supports the
conclusion that parameters for which this part of the spectrum leaves
observable traces in the CMB must be excluded. Parameters entailing a very
efficient second inflation correspond to standard small-field inflation and can
meet observational constraints. Particular attention is paid to the case where
the second inflation leads solely to a shift of the observable spectrum from
the first inflation. A viable scenario requires this shift to be small.

signals characterizing both the visual appearance and motion dynamics of the
involved humans and objects. Inspired by the success of convolutional neural
networks (CNN) for image classification, recent attempts have been made to
learn 3D CNNs for recognizing human actions in videos. However, partly due to
the high complexity of training 3D convolution kernels and the need for large
quantities of training videos, only limited success has been reported. This has
triggered us to investigate in this paper a new deep architecture which can
handle 3D signals more effectively. Specifically, we propose factorized
spatio-temporal convolutional networks (FstCN) that factorize the original 3D
convolution kernel learning as a sequential process of learning 2D spatial
kernels in the lower layers (called spatial convolutional layers), followed by
learning 1D temporal kernels in the upper layers (called temporal convolutional
layers). We introduce a novel transformation and permutation operator to make
factorization in FstCN possible. Moreover, to address the issue of sequence
alignment, we propose an effective training and inference strategy based on
sampling multiple video clips from a given action video sequence. We have
tested FstCN on two commonly used benchmark datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51).
Without using auxiliary training videos to boost the performance, FstCN
outperforms existing CNN based methods and achieves comparable performance with
a recent method that benefits from using auxiliary training videos.

sources; roughly 10% of all sources in the field are doubles with a separation
smaller than 1 arcmin. The spectral fit of the four components is consistent
with a scenario in which the outer lobes are still active or the jets recently
switched off, while emission of the inner lobes is the result of a mix-up of
new and old jet activity. From the presence of the newly extended features in
the inner lobes of the DDRG, we can infer that the mechanism responsible for
their formation is the bow shock that is driven by the newly launched jet. We
find that the density of the small doubles exceeds the density of FR-II sources
with similar properties at 1.4 GHz, but this difference becomes smaller for low
flux densities.

for the singlet BFKL. After this modification the adjoint NLO BFKL eigenvalue
is expressed through holomorphic and antiholomophic parts of the leading order

expression is supported by the fact that it is possible to obtain the same
result in a relatively straightforward way directly from the singlet NLO BFKL

the remainder function of the BDS amplitude. However, the notion of the adjoint
BFKL eigenvalue is vaguely defined due to removal of the infrared divergences

important in resolving the issue of the non-vanishing adjoint NNLO eigenvalue

autonomous Hamiltonian systems introduced in [25]. This mechanism is based on
shadowing of pseudo-orbits generated by two dynamics: an `outer dynamics',
given by homoclinic trajectories to a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold,
and an `inner dynamics', given by the restriction to that manifold. On the
inner dynamics the only assumption is that it preserves area. Unlike other
approaches, [25] does not rely on the KAM theory and/or Aubry-Mather theory to
establish the existence of diffusion. Moreover, it does not require to check
twist conditions or non-degeneracy conditions near resonances. The conditions
are explicit and can be checked by finite precision calculations in concrete
systems.
  As an application, we study the planar elliptic restricted three-body
problem. We present a rigorous theorem that shows that if some concrete
calculations yield a non zero value, then for any sufficiently small, positive
value of the eccentricity of the orbits of the main bodies, there are orbits of
the infinitesimal body that exhibit a change of energy that is bigger than some
fixed number, which is independent of the eccentricity.
  We verify numerically these calculations for values of the masses close to
that of the Jupiter/Sun system. The numerical calculations are not completely
rigorous, because we ignore issues of round-off error and do not estimate the
truncations, but they are not delicate at all by the standard of numerical
analysis. (Standard tests indicate that we get 7 or 8 figures of accuracy where
1 would be enough). The code of this verifications is available. We hope that
some full computer assisted proofs will be obtained in a near future since
there are packages (CAPD) designed for problems of this type.

attempted transitions between all different patches. The results are
patchworked to cover the whole state space. We extend the concept of truncated
Markov chains which is originally formulated for processes which obey detailed
balance to processes not fulfilling detailed balance. The method is illustrated
by three examples, describing the one-dimensional diffusion of an overdamped

is often necessary to know all possible objects in advance, so that a database
with models of all objects can be generated for visual identification. However,
this constraint cannot always be fulfilled. Due to that reason, a model based
object recognition cannot be used to guide the robot's interactions. Therefore,
this paper proposes a system that analyzes features of encountered objects and
then uses these features to compare unknown objects to already known ones. From
the resulting similarity appropriate actions can be derived. Moreover, the
system enables the robot to learn object categories by grouping similar objects
or by splitting existing categories. To represent the knowledge a hybrid form
is used, consisting of both symbolic and subsymbolic representations.

complexity and system performance in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. This
type of precoding allows mmWave systems to leverage large antenna array gains
that are necessary for sufficient link margin, while permitting low cost and
power consumption hardware. Most prior work has focused on hybrid precoding for
narrowband mmWave systems, with perfect or estimated channel knowledge at the
transmitter. MmWave systems, however, will likely operate on wideband channels
with frequency selectivity. Therefore, this paper considers wideband mmWave
systems with a limited feedback channel between the transmitter and receiver.
First, the optimal hybrid precoding design for a given RF codebook is derived.
This provides a benchmark for any other heuristic algorithm and gives useful
insights into codebook designs. Second, efficient hybrid analog/digital
codebooks are developed for spatial multiplexing in wideband mmWave systems.
Finally, a low-complexity yet near-optimal greedy frequency selective hybrid
precoding algorithm is proposed based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
Simulation results show that the developed hybrid codebooks and precoder
designs achieve very good performance compared with the unconstrained solutions
while requiring much less complexity.

conduction band electrons in the temperature regime of a few eVs. The

the size distribution and cross-sectional area of dust released in the original
asteroid disruption, before it is lost to orbital and collisional decay. We
find that the Emilkowalski cluster is the source of this partial band and that
the dust released in the disruption would correspond to a regolith layer
$\sim$3 m deep on the $\sim$10 km diameter source body's surface. The dust in
this band is described by a cumulative size-distribution inverse power-law
index with a lower bound of 2.1 (implying domination of cross-sectional area by
small particles) for dust particles with diameters ranging from a few $\mu$m up
to a few cm. The coadded observations show that the thermal emission of the
dust band structure is dominated by large (mm--cm size) particles. We find that
dust particle ejection velocities need to be a few times the escape velocity of
the Emilkowalski cluster source body to provide a good fit to the inclination
dispersion of the observations. We discuss the implications that such a
significant release of material during a disruption has for the temporal
evolution of the structure, composition, and magnitude of the zodiacal cloud.

wireless networks to move towards new networking paradigms that are able to
efficiently support resource-demanding applications such as personalized mobile
services. Examples of such paradigms foreseen for the emerging fifth generation
(5G) cellular networks include very densely deployed small cells and
device-to-device communications. For 5G networks, it will be imperative to
search for spectrum and energy-efficient solutions to the resource allocation
problems that i) are amenable to distributed implementation, ii) are capable of
dealing with uncertainty and lack of information, and iii) can cope with users'
selfishness. The core objective of this article is to investigate and to
establish the potential of multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to address this
challenge. In particular, we provide a brief tutorial on bandit problems,
including different variations and solution approaches. Furthermore, we discuss
recent applications as well as future research directions. In addition, we
provide a detailed example of using an MAB model for energy-efficient small
cell planning in 5G networks.

the Fibonacci sequence, and also its q-deformed or quantum extension, in the
study of the genetic code(s). First, after the presentation of a new formula,
an indexed double Fibonacci sequence, comprising the first six Fibonacci
numbers, is shown to describe the 20 amino acids multiplets and their
degeneracy as well as a characteristic pattern for the 61 meaningful codons.
Next, the twenty amino acids, classified according to their increasing
atom-number (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur), exhibit several Fibonacci
sequence patterns. Several mathematical relations are given, describing various
atom-number patterns. Finally, a q-Fibonacci simple phenomenological model,
with q a real deformation parameter, is used to describe, in a unified way, not
only the standard genetic code, when q=1, but also all known slight variations
of this latter, when q~1, as well as the case of the 21st amino acid
(Selenocysteine) and the 22nd one (Pyrrolysine), also when q~1. As a by-product
of this elementary model, we also show that, in the limit q=0, the number of
amino acids reaches the value 6, in good agreement with old and still
persistent claims stating that life, in its early development, could have used
only a small number of amino acids.

has provided insights into how quantum mechanics might modify the classical
general relativistic description of space-time, an exact quantum description of
space-times with matter has remained elusive. In this note we outline how the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation theory of Einstein spaces might be generalized
to include matter by transplanting the theory to the 25+1 dimensional
Lorentzian Leech lattice. Remarkably when a hexagonal section of the Leech
lattice is set aside as the stage for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the
discrete automorphism group of the complex Leech lattice with one complex
direction fixed can be lifted to continuous Lie group symmetries. In this
setting the wave function becomes an 11x11 complex matrix which represents
matter degrees of freedom consisting of a 2-form abelian gauge field and vector
nonabelian SU(3)xE6 gauge fields together with their supersymmetric partners.
The lagrangian field equations for this matrix wave function appear to be a
promising starting point for resolving the unphysical features inherent in the
general relativistic descriptions of gravitational collapse and the big bang.

of these objects in the modern density does not exceed the total density of

among dark matter candidates. However, we reveal a nontrivial property of
compact objects with de Sitter interior to induce proton decay or decay of
neutrons in neutron stars. The point is that they can form graviatoms, binding
electrically charged particles. Their observational signatures as dark matter
candidates provide also signatures for inhomogeneity of the early universe. In
graviatoms, the cross-section of the induced proton decay is strongly enhanced,
what provides the possibility of their experimental searches. We predict proton
decay paths induced by graviatoms in the matter as an observational signature
for heavy dark matter searches at the IceCUBE experiment.

correctness properties of safety and liveness. As these systems have
concurrency, and often have dynamic environment, the formal specification and
verification of these systems along with step-wise refinement from abstract to
concrete concepts play a major role in system correctness. Formal verification
is used for exhaustive investigation of the system space thus ensuring that
undetected failures in the behavior are excluded. We construct the system
incrementally from subcomponents, based on software architecture. The challenge
is to develop a safe multi-agent robotic system, more specifically to ensure
the correctness properties of safety and liveness. Formal specifications based
on model-checking are flexible, have a concrete syntax, and play vital role in
correctness of a multi-agent robotic system. To formally verify safety and
liveness of such systems is important because they have high concurrency and in
most of the cases have dynamic environment. We have considered a case-study of
a multi-agent robotic system for the transport of stock between storehouses to
exemplify our formal approach. Our proposed development approach allows for
formal verification during specification definition. The development process
has been classified in to four major phases of requirement specifications,
verification specifications, architecture specifications and implementation.
