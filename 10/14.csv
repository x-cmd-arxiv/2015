(ICM) and the member galaxies are of crucial importance in order to understand
the dynamics in galaxy clusters, the chemical enrichment processes and the
validity of their hydrostatic mass estimates. Recently, several X-ray tails
associated to gas which was partly stripped of galaxies have been discovered.
Here we report on the X-ray tail in the 3 keV galaxy cluster Zwicky 8338, which
might be the longest ever observed. We derive the properties of the galaxy
cluster environment and give hints on the substructure present in this X-ray
tail, which is very likely associated to the galaxy CGCG254-021. The X-ray tail
is extraordinarily luminous ($2\times10^{42}$ erg/s), the thermal emission has
a temperature of 0.8 keV and the X-ray luminous gas might be stripped off
completely from the galaxy. From the assumptions on the 3D geometry we estimate
the gas mass fraction (< 0.1%) and conclude that the gas has been compressed
and/or heated.

gas-bearing debris disk, where the CO 3-2 transition was successfully detected.
No other individual system exhibited a measurable CO signal. Our Herschel Space
Observatory far-infrared images of HD 131835 marginally resolved the disk both
at 70 and 100$\mu$m, with a characteristic radius of ~170 au. While in stellar
properties HD 131835 resembles $\beta$ Pic, its dust disk properties are
similar to those of the most massive young debris disks. With the detection of
gas in HD 131835 the number of known debris disks with CO content has increased
to four, all of them encircling young ($\leq$40 Myr) A-type stars. Based on
statistics within 125 pc, we suggest that the presence of detectable amount of
gas in the most massive debris disks around young A-type stars is a common
phenomenon. Our current data cannot conclude on the origin of gas in HD 131835.
If the gas is secondary, arising from the disruption of planetesimals, then HD
131835 is a comparably young and in terms of its disk more massive analogue of
the $\beta$ Pic system. However, it is also possible that this system similarly
to HD 21997 possesses a hybrid disk, where the gas material is predominantly
primordial, while the dust grains are mostly derived from planetesimals.

challenging task, as the number of parameters to estimate easily is much larger

model likelihood. In network models, this is often done locally in the
neighbourhood of each node or gene. However, estimation of the many
regularization parameters is often difficult and can result in large
statistical uncertainties. In this paper we propose to combine local
regularization with global shrinkage of the regularization parameters to borrow
strength between genes and improve inference. We employ a simple Bayesian model
with non-sparse, conjugate priors to facilitate the use of fast variational
approximations to posteriors. We discuss empirical Bayes estimation of
hyper-parameters of the priors, and propose a novel approach to rank-based
posterior thresholding. Using extensive model- and data-based simulations, we
demonstrate that the proposed inference strategy outperforms popular (sparse)
methods, yields more stable edges, and is more reproducible.

Continuous photometry from the K2 mission on Campaign Two has revealed the
presence of additional eclipses due to the presence of a third star in the
system. These are explained by a system composed of the two previously known
members of the eclipsing system (Ba and Bb) with a period of 1.63 d, orbiting
around an F7-F8V star with a period of 33.945 +/- 0.002 d in an eccentric orbit
(e_A = 0.2652 +/- 0.0003). The timing of the eclipses of Ba and Bb reveals the
same 33.9 d periodicity, which we interpret as the combination of a light time
effect combined with dynamical perturbations on the close system. Here we
combine radial velocities and analytical approximations for the timing of the
eclipses to derive masses and radii for the three components of the system. We
obtain a mass of 1.44 +/- 0.04 M_sun and radius of 2.41 +/- 0.03 R_sun for the
A component, and almost identical masses and radii of about 0.96 M_sun and 1.33

material phenomena, yet a fundamental understanding of the effect of surface
structure, energetics and kinetics on the underlying thermo-mechanical response
remains elusive. Here, we employ non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)
simulations to describe the nanoscale dynamics of the high velocity impact
between commensurate and incommensurate monocrystalline (001) copper surfaces.
For impact velocities in the range 100-1200 m/s, the kinetic energy dissipation
involves nucleation and emission of dislocation loops from defective sites
within the rapidly forming interface, well below the bulk single-crystal yield
point. At higher velocities, adiabatic dissipation occurs via
plasticity-induced heating as the interface structurally melts following the
impact. The adhesive strength of the reformed interface is controlled by the
formation and nucleation of dislocations and point defects as they modify the
interfacial energy relative to the deformed bulk. As confirmation, the excess
interface energy decreases monotonically with increasing impact velocity. The
relative crystal orientation of the surfaces equally important; the grain
boundaries formed following incommensurate impact exhibit higher impact
resistance, with smaller defect densities and interfacial enthalpies,
suggesting an enhanced ability of the grain boundaries to absorb the
non-equilibrium damage and therefore facilitate particle bonding. Our study
highlights the key role played by the atomic-scale surface structure in
determining the impact resistance and adhesion of crystalline surfaces.

constant regardless of the number of explanatory variables. The model
parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm which is scalable and leads to
significantly faster convergence, compared with simulation-based methods.

on a transmission filter that consists of finite number of transmission steps.
A discrete optimization algorithm is proposed for the design of the
transmission filter that is optimized for ground-based telescopes with central
obstructions and spider structures.We discussed the algorithm that is applied
for our coronagraph design. To demonstrate the performance of the coronagraph,
a filter was manufactured and laboratory tests were conducted. The test results
show that the coronagraph can achieve a high contrast of 10 to -6.5 at an inner
working angle of 5{\lambda}/D, which indicates that our coronagraph can be
immediately used for the direct imaging of Jupiter-like exoplanets with
ground-based telescopes.

uncertainty. Specifically, we consider the following objectives that we would
like to accomplish. The first one being of a controllability-type that consists
of guaranteeing the terminal state to reach a target set starting from an
initial condition, while the second one is keeping the state trajectory of the
system close to a given reference trajectory over a finite time interval. We
introduce the following framework. First, we partition the control subdomain
into two disjoint open subdomains, with smooth boundaries, that are compatible
with the strategy subspaces of the {\it leader} (which is responsible for the
controllability-type criterion) and that of the {\it follower} (which is
associated with the second criterion), respectively. Moreover, we account at
the optimization stage for model uncertainty by allowing the {\it leader} to
choose its control strategy based on a class of alternative models about the
system, whereas the {\it follower} makes use of an approximate model about the
system. Using the notion of Stackelberg's optimization, we provide conditions
on the existence of optimal control strategies for such a hierarchical control
problem, under which the {\it follower} is required to respond optimally to the
strategy of the {\it leader} so as to achieve the overall objectives. Apart
from the issue of modeling and uncertainty, this paper is a companion to our
previous work.

diffeomorphism group. For template matching (template deformation), the
Euler-Lagrangian equation, arising from minimizing an energy function, falls
into the Euler-Poincar\'e theory and can be recast into the EP equations. By
casting the EP equations in the Lagrangian (or characteristics) form, we
formulate the equations as a finite dimensional particle system. The evolution
of this particle system describes the geodesic motion of landmark points on a
Riemann manifold. In this paper we present a class of novel algorithms that
take advantage of the structure of the particle system to achieve a fast
matching process between the reference and the target templates. The strong
suit of the proposed algorithms includes (1) the efficient feedback control
iteration, which allows one to find the initial velocity field for driving the
deformation from the reference template to the target one, (2) the use of the
conical kernel in the particle system, which limits the interaction between
particles and thus accelerates the convergence, and (3) the availability of the
implementation of fast-multipole method for solving the particle system, which
could reduce the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N\log N)$, where $N$ is
the number of particles. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithms
are analyzed. Finally, we present several examples for both exact and inexact
matchings, and numerically analyze the iterative process to illustrate the
efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithms.

optimal exponent of the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality is obtained when
the functional is Morse-Bott, improving on similar results due to Chill (2003,

arXiv:1903.01953, we apply our abstract Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities
to prove a Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities for the harmonic map energy
functional using Sobolev spaces which impose minimal regularity requirements on
maps between closed, Riemannian manifolds. Those inequalities for the harmonic
map energy functional generalize those of Kwon (2002), Liu and Yang (2010),
Simon (1983, 1985), and Topping (1997). In our monograph arXiv:1510.03815, we
prove Lojasiewicz--Simon gradient inequalities for coupled Yang--Mills energy
functions using Sobolev spaces which impose minimal regularity requirements on
pairs of connections and sections. Those inequalities generalize that of the
pure Yang--Mills energy function due to the first author (Theorems 23.1 and
23.17 in arXiv:1409.1525) for base manifolds of arbitrary dimension and due to

democracy, the idea that it is a form of governance based on collective
decision making seems to be uncontested. On the premise that in the
high-quality democracy citizens (agents) not only must have equal participation
rights but must want to participate in shaping decision, as an effective
measure of democracy in a two party political system we propose the percentage
of the total population that actually voted in a given elections only for two
major parties. Thus, we disregard not only nonvoters but also smaller parties
voters whom votes will not have a substantial impact on the election and
consequently they will not be in the loop, even theoretically. To describe such
a system a sociophysics model based on the $S=1$ Ising model (Blume-Capel) is
proposed. The measure of democracy, V_D index, as a function of inter-party
conflict is analyzed.

performance on the practically important task of sentence classification (kim
2014, kalchbrenner 2014, johnson 2014). However, these models require
practitioners to specify an exact model architecture and set accompanying
hyperparameters, including the filter region size, regularization parameters,
and so on. It is currently unknown how sensitive model performance is to
changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We
thus conduct a sensitivity analysis of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of
architecture components on model performance; our aim is to distinguish between
important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence
classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex
models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance,
which makes it a modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine
(SVMs) and logistic regression. We derive practical advice from our extensive
empirical results for those interested in getting the most out of CNNs for
sentence classification in real world settings.

  Proxies Within the Neutral Interstellar Medium of Star-Forming Galaxies","8 pages, 3 figures, published by ApJ","853:124 (7pp), 2018 February 1",,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The abundance of oxygen in galaxies is widely used in furthering our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Unfortunately, direct
measurements of O/H in the neutral gas are extremely difficult to obtain, as
the only OI line available within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV
wavelength range (1150-3200 A) is often saturated. As such, proxies for oxygen
are needed to indirectly derive O/H via the assumption that solar ratios based
on local Milky Way sight lines hold in different environments. In this paper we
assess the validity of using two such proxies, PII and SII, within more typical
star-forming environments. Using HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) far-UV
(FUV) spectra of a sample of nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and the oxygen
abundances in their ionized gas, we demonstrate that both P and S are mildly
depleted with respect to O and follow a trend, log(PII/SII)= -1.73+/-0.18, in
excellent agreement with the solar ratio of log(P/S)_sol=-1.71+/-0.04 over the
large range of metallicities (0.03-3.2 Z_sol) and H I column densities (log[N(H
I)/cm^-2] =18.44-21.28) spanned by the sample. From literature data we show
evidence that both elements individually trace oxygen according to their
respective solar ratios across a wide range of environments. Our findings
demonstrate that the solar ratios of log(P/O)_sol=-3.28+/-0.06 and
log(S/O)_sol=-1.57+/-0.06 can both be used to derive reliable O/H abundances in
the neutral gas of local and high-redshift SFGs. The difference between O/H in
the ionized- and neutral-gas phases is studied with respect to metallicity and
H I content. The observed trends are consistent with galactic outflows and/or
star formation inefficiency affecting the most metal-poor galaxies, with the
possibility of primordial gas accretion at all metallicities.

years. A rich body of these studies is related to influence maximization, which
aims to select a set of seed nodes for maximizing the expected number of active
nodes at the end of the process. However, the set of active nodes can not fully
represent the true coverage of information propagation. A node may be informed
of the information when any of its neighbours become active and try to activate
it, though this node (namely informed node) is still inactive. Therefore, we
need to consider both active nodes and informed nodes that are aware of the
information when we study the coverage of information propagation in a network.
Along this line, in this paper we propose a new problem called Information
Coverage Maximization that aims to maximize the expected number of both active
nodes and informed ones. After we prove that this problem is NP-hard and
submodular in the independent cascade model and the linear threshold model, we
design two algorithms to solve it. Extensive experiments on three real-world
data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

orientation at low temperatures. The system exhibits rich physical properties,
such as infinite number of ground states, memory effect and aging phenomena.
There are two main ingredients considered to be pivotal for the existence of SG
behavior, namely, frustration and randomness. For the canonical SG system,
frustration is led by the presence of competing interaction between
ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings. Previously, Bartolozzi
{\it et al.} [ Phys. Rev. B{\bf 73}, 224419 (2006)], reported the SG properties
of the AF Ising spins on scale free network (SFN). It is a new type of SG,
different from the canonical one which requires the presence of both FM and AF
couplings. In this new system, frustration is purely caused by the topological
factor and its randomness is related to the irregular connectvity. Recently,
Surungan {\it et. al.} [Journal of Physics: Conference Series 640, 012001
(2015)] reported SG bahavior of AF Heisenberg model on SFN. We further
investigate this type of system by studying an AF Heisenberg model on rewired
square lattices. We used Replica Exchange algorithm of Monte Carlo Method and
calculated the SG order parameter to search for the existence of SG phase.

stochastic model, assuming that the observed data may be dependent and
non-identically distributed and the prior distribution of the change point is
arbitrary, not necessarily geometric. Tartakovsky and Veeravalli (2004)
developed a general asymptotic theory of changepoint detection in the non-iid
case and discrete time, and Baron and Tartakovsky (2006) in continuous time
assuming certain stability of the log-likelihood ratio process. This stability
property was formulated in terms of the r-quick convergence of the normalized
log-likelihood ratio process to a positive and finite number, which can be
interpreted as the limiting Kullback-Leibler information between the ""change""
and ""no change"" hypotheses. In these papers, it was conjectured that the
r-quick convergence can be relaxed in the r-complete convergence, which is
typically much easier to verify in particular examples. In the present paper,
we justify this conjecture by showing that the Shiryaev change detection
procedure is nearly optimal, minimizing asymptotically (as the probability of
false alarm vanishes) the moments of the delay to detection up to order r
whenever r-complete convergence holds. We also study asymptotic properties of
the Shiryaev-Roberts detection procedure in the Bayesian context.

fraction. Assuming $f_{\Xi_b^-}/f_{\Lambda_b^0}$ is bounded between 0.1 and
0.3, the branching fraction ${\cal{B}}(\Xi_b^-\to\Lambda_b^0\pi^-)$ would lie

convective-type cloud and precipitation to temperature changes. Yet, it is
unclear if precipitation intensities will increase mainly due to modified
thermodynamic forcing or due to stronger convective dynamics. In gradual
self-organization, convective events produce highest intensities late in the
day. Tracking rain cells throughout their life cycles, we find that interacting
events respond strongly to changes in boundary conditions. Conversely, events
without interaction remain unaffected. Increased surface temperature indeed
leads to more interaction and higher precipitation extremes. However, a similar
intensification occurs when leaving temperature unchanged but simply granting
more time for self-organization.Our study implies that the convective field as
a whole acquires a memory of past precipitation and inter-cloud dynamics,
driving extremes. Our results implicate that the dynamical interaction between
convective clouds must be incorporated in global climate models to describe
convective extremes and the diurnal cycle more realistically.

breaking of the time-reversal symmetry in the system. We derive a general
expression for the supercurrent for a class of short topological junctions in
terms of the normal state scattering matrix. The result is strongly asymmetric
with respect to the superconducting gaps in the ordinary ($\Delta_0$) and
topological ($\Delta_{\mathrm{top}}$) leads. We apply the general result to a
simple model of a nanowire setup with strong spin-orbit coupling in an external
magnetic field and proximity-induced superconductivity. The system shows
parametrically strong suppression of the critical current $I_c \propto
\Delta_{\mathrm{top}}/R_N^2$ in the tunneling limit ($R_N$ is the normal state
resistance). This is in strong contrast with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation
applicable to junctions with preserved time-reversal symmetry. We also consider
the case of a generic junction with a random scattering matrix and obtain a
more conventional scaling law $I_c \propto \Delta_{\mathrm{top}}/R_N$.

so widespread and common that they are often used without references to the
rigorous definitions or pioneering works. The survey is devoted to the finite
dimensional dynamical systems in Euclidean space and its aim is to explain, in
a simple but rigorous way, the connection between the key works in the area: by
Kaplan and Yorke (the concept of Lyapunov dimension, 1979), Douady and Oesterle

(estimation of the Lyapunov dimension via the direct Lyapunov method, 1991),
and numerical methods for the computation of Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov
dimension. In this survey a concise overview of the classical results is
presented, various definitions of Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension are
discussed.
  An effective analytical method for the estimation of Lyapunov dimension is
presented, its application to the self-excited and hidden attractors of
well-known dynamical systems is demonstrated, and analytical formulas of exact

near-earth objects (NEOs) via lunar monitoring. The project involves upgrading
the 1.2m Kryoneri telescope at the National Observatory of Athens, procuring
two fast-frame cameras, and developing a software system, which will control
the telescope and the cameras, process the images and automatically detect NEO
impacts. NELIOTA will provide a web-based user interface, where the impact
events will be reported and made available to the scientific community and the
general public. The objective of this 3.5 year activity is to design, develop
and implement a highly automated lunar monitoring system, which will conduct an
observing campaign for 2 years in search of NEO impact flashes on the Moon. The
impact events will be verified, characterised and reported. The 1.2m telescope
will be capable of detecting flashes much fainter than current, small-aperture,
lunar monitoring telescopes. NELIOTA is therefore expected to characterise the
frequency and distribution of NEOs weighing as little as a few grams.

the rho-decay plane method for tau-to-rho decays and the impact parameter

measurement uncertainties on the signal and background distributions. We obtain
that the mixing angle can be determined with an uncertainty of 15 degree (9

remnant black holes, then many must be accreting at super-Eddington rates. It
is predicted that such high accretion rates should give rise to massive,
radiatively-driven winds. However, observational evidence of a wind, in the
form of absorption or emission features, has remained elusive. As such, the
reported detection of X-ray spectral residuals in XMM-Newton spectra of NGC
5408 X-1, which could be related to absorption in a wind is potentially very
exciting. However, it has previously been assumed by several authors that these
features simply originate from background diffuse plasma emission related to
star-formation in the ULX's host galaxy. In this work we utilise the spatial
resolving power of Chandra to test whether we can rule out this latter
interpretation. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity in these
spectral features is emitted from a highly localised region close to the ULX,
and appears point-like even with Chandra. It is therefore highly likely that
the spectral features are associated with the ULX itself, and little of the
flux in this spectral component originates from spatially extended emission in
the host galaxy. This may be consistent with the suggestion of absorption in an
optically thin phase of a super-Eddington wind. Alternatively, we could be
seeing emission from collisionally ionised material close to the black hole,
but critically this would be difficult to reconcile with models where the
source inclination largely determines the observed X-ray spectral and timing
properties.

correlation function, this model is in agreement with the estimates of
confusion present in stacked Parkes telescope data, and was used to predict how
confusion will limit stacking in the deepest SKA-precursor HI surveys. Stacking
with LADUMA and DINGO UDEEP data will only be mildly impacted by confusion if
their target synthesised beam size of 10 arcsec can be achieved. Any beam size
significantly above this will result in stacks that contain a mass in confused
sources that is comparable to (or greater than) that which is detectable via
stacking, at all redshifts. CHILES' 5 arcsec resolution is more than adequate
to prevent confusion influencing stacking of its data, throughout its bandpass
range. FAST will be the most impeded by confusion, with HI surveys likely
becoming heavily confused much beyond z = 0.1. The largest uncertainties in our
model are the redshift evolution of the HI density of the Universe and the HI
correlation function. However, we argue that the two idealised cases we adopt
should bracket the true evolution, and the qualitative conclusions are
unchanged regardless of the model choice. The profile shape of the signal due

that it can take the form of a double Gaussian with a narrow and wide

speed-ups and provides a striking example of a phenomenon with no classical
counterpart. An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three
slit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in
terms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits.
This is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the
interference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who
asked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit
experiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of
quantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope
of determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer
from pathological--or at least undesirable--features. In this paper two
proposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density
Cubes proposed by Dakic et al., which has been shown to exhibit irreducible
interference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of
Zyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage
over quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a
well-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory. Despite
this, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient
to uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is
well-defined and we show that it exhibits irreducible interference to all
orders. This feature of the theory is argued not to be a genuine phenomenon,
but to arise from an ambiguity in the current definition of higher-order
interference. To understand why quantum theory has limited interference
therefore, a new operational definition of higher-order interference is needed.

low-energy excitation, with matter existing as deconfined but gapped
excitations of the system. It is found that, for a given bipartition of the
system, the elements of the entanglement spectrum can be grouped according to
the electric flux between the two regions, leading to a useful interpretation
of the entanglement spectrum in terms of electric charges living on the
boundary. The entanglement spectrum is also given additional structure due to
the presence of the gapless photon. Making use of the Bisognano-Wichmann
theorem and a local thermal approximation, these two contributions to the
entanglement (particle and photon) are recast in terms of boundary and bulk
contributions, respectively. Both pieces of the entanglement structure give
rise to universal subleading terms (relative to the area law) in the
entanglement entropy, which are logarithmic in the system size (log L), as
opposed to the subleading constant term in gapped topologically ordered
systems. The photon subleading logarithm arises from the low-energy conformal
field theory and is essentially local in character. The particle subleading
logarithm arises due to the constraint of closed electric loops in the
wavefunction and is shown to be the natural generalization of topological
entanglement entropy to the U(1) spin liquid. This contribution to the

far-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct
consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit
order-of-magnitude SFR variations over timescales of a few Myr. We show that
the difference in the scatter between the simulated H$\alpha$- and FUV-derived
SFR--$M_*$ relations at $z=2$ is consistent with observational constraints. We
also find that the H$\alpha$/FUV ratios predicted by the simulations at $z=0$
are similar to those observed for local galaxies except for a population of
low-mass ($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5} {\rm M}_\odot$) simulated galaxies with lower

widely adopted single Sersic fits from previous studies to the results from a
full morphological decomposition, and address the issue of how biased the
inferred properties of AGN hosts are by a potential nuclear contribution from
the AGN itself. We find that the AGN hosts are mixed systems which have higher
bulge fractions than the control sample in our highest redshift bins at the
>99.7% confidence level, according to all model fits even those which adopt a
point-source component. This serves to alleviate concerns that previous, purely
single Sersic, analyses of AGN hosts could have been spuriously biased towards
higher bulge fractions. This dataset allows us to further probe the physical
nature of these point-source components; we find no strong correlation between
the point-source component and AGN activity, and that these point-source
components are best modelled physically by nuclear starbursts. Our analysis of
the bulge and disk fractions of these AGN hosts in comparison to a mass-matched
control sample reveals a similar morphological evolutionary track for both the
active and non-active populations, providing further evidence in favour of a
model where AGN activity is triggered by secular processes.

may thermalize, a general disorder-free many-body Hamiltonian of a typical
atomic system has solid-like eigenstates at low energies and fluid-type (and
gaseous, plasma) eigenstates associated with energy densities exceeding those
present in the melting (and, respectively, higher energy) transition(s). In
particular, the lowest energy density at which the eigenstates of such a clean
many body atomic system undergo a non-analytic change is that of the melting
(or freezing) transition. We invoke this observation to analyze the evolution
of a liquid upon supercooling (i.e., cooling rapidly enough to avoid
solidification below the freezing temperature). Expanding the wavefunction of a
supercooled liquid in the complete eigenbasis of the many-body Hamiltonian,
only the higher energy liquid-type eigenstates contribute significantly to
measurable hydrodynamic relaxations (e.g., those probed by viscosity) while
static thermodynamic observables become weighted averages over both solid- and
liquid-type eigenstates. Consequently, when extrapolated to low temperatures,
hydrodynamic relaxation times of deeply supercooled liquids (i.e., glasses) may
seem to diverge at nearly the same temperature at which the extrapolated
entropy of the supercooled liquid becomes that of the solid. In this formal
quantum framework, the increasingly sluggish (and spatially heterogeneous)
dynamics in supercooled liquids as their temperature is lowered stems from the
existence of the single non-analytic change of the eigenstates of the clean
many-body Hamiltonian at the equilibrium melting transition present in low
energy solid-type eigenstates. We derive a single (possibly computable)
dimensionless parameter fit to the viscosity and suggest other testable
predictions of our approach.

[alpha/Fe]=-0.19+-0.14. If this result is representative of the average cluster
properties, H4 is the only known system with a low [alpha/Fe] ratio and a
moderately low metallicity embedded in an intact birth environment. For the
field stars we find a clear sequence, seen as an early depletion in [alpha/Fe]
at low metallicities, in good agreement with previous measurements. H4 falls on
top of the observed field star [alpha/Fe] sequence and clearly disagrees with
the properties of Milky Way halo stars. We therefore conclude that within a
galaxy, the chemical enrichment of globular clusters may be closely linked to
the enrichment pattern of the field star population. The low [alpha/Fe] ratios
of H4 and similar metallicity field stars in Fornax give evidence that slow
chemical enrichment environments, such as dwarf galaxies, may be the original
hosts of alpha-depleted clusters in the halos of the Milky Way and M31.

Here, we compare the accretion rates of 16 red quasars at $z \sim 0.7$ to those

reminiscent of the double Dirac cone St\""uckelberg interferometer that was
recently studied in the continuum limit [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 155302 (2014)].
Although the two problems share similarities -- such as the appearance of a

make them truly different. The particle dynamics in the presence of a force is
described by the Bloch Hamiltonian $H(\boldsymbol{k})$ defined from the
tight-binding Hamiltonian and the position operator. This leads to many
interesting effects for the lattice St\""uckelberg interferometer: a twisting of
the two Landau-Zener tunnelings, saturation of the inter-band transition
probability in the sudden (infinite force) limit and extended periodicity or
even non-periodicity beyond the first Brillouin zone. In particular,
St\""uckelberg interferometry gives access to the overlap matrix of
cell-periodic Bloch states thereby allowing to fully characterize the geometry

2014, we give our perspective on the external field problem in quantum
electrodynamics (QED), i.e., QED without photons in which the sole interaction
stems from an external, time-dependent, four-vector potential. Among others,
this model was considered by Dirac, Schwinger, Feynman, and Dyson as a model to
describe the phenomenon of electron-positron pair creation in regimes in which
the interaction between electrons can be neglected and a mean field description
of the photon degrees of freedom is valid (e.g., static field of heavy nuclei
or lasers fields). Although it may appear as second easiest model to study, it
already bares a severe divergence in its equations of motion preventing any
straight-forward construction of the corresponding evolution operator. In
informal computations of the vacuum polarization current this divergence leads
to the need of the so-called charge renormalization. In an attempt to provide a
bridge between physics and mathematics, this work gives a review ranging from
the heuristic picture to our rigorous results in a way that is hopefully also
accessible to non-experts and students. We discuss how the evolution operator
can be constructed, how this construction yields well-defined and unique
transition probabilities, and how it provides a family of candidates for charge
current operators without the need of removing ill-defined quantities. We
conclude with an outlook of what needs to be done to identify the physical
charge current among this family.

(anti)neutrino mass. We assume that the incoming (anti)neutrino beam comes from
the polarized muon decay at rest and is the left-right chiral mixture with
assigned direction of the transversal spin polarization with respect to the
production plane. We display that the azimuthal asymmetry in the angular
distribution of recoil electrons is generated by the interference terms between
the standard and exotic couplings, which are proportional to the transversal
(anti)neutrino spin polarization and independent of the neutrino mass. This
asymmetry for the Majorana neutrinos is distinct from the one for the Dirac
neutrinos through the absence of interference between the standard and tensor
couplings. Additionally, the interference term between the standard and scalar

of an external magnetic field using Wilson fermions in the quenched
approximation. Motivated by qualitative differences observed in the spectra of
overlap and Wilson fermions for large magnetic fields, we investigate the
dependence of the additive quark mass renormalisation on the magnetic field. We
provide evidence that the magnetic field changes the critical quark mass both
in the free case and on our quenched ensemble. The associated change of the
bare quark mass with the magnetic field affects the spectrum and is relevant
for the magnetic field dependence of a number of related quantities. We derive
Ward identities for lattice and continuum QCD+QED from which we can extract the
current quark masses. We also report on a first test of the tuning of the quark
masses with the magnetic field using the current quark masses, and show that
this tuning resolves the qualitative discrepancy between the Wilson and overlap
spectra.

the solutions to a set of $3$ transport equations derived under the assumption
of supergauge equilibrium and the diffusion approximation. The result is then
rederived efficiently using a technique we present involving a parametrized
ansatz which turns the process of deriving a solution into an almost elementary
problem. We then show how both the derivation and the parametrized ansatz
technique can be generalized to solve an arbitrary number of transport

terms at the bubble wall and through the symmetric phase.

prevalence of Earth-size planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. To determine the
occurrence of planets having different sizes, orbital periods, and other
properties, I conducted a survey of extrasolar planets using data collected by
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. This project involved writing new algorithms to
analyze Kepler data, finding planets, and conducting follow-up work using
ground-based telescopes. I found that most stars have at least one planet at or
within Earth's orbit and that 26% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size planet
with an orbital period of 100 days or less.
  The second topic is the connection between the properties of planets and
their host stars. The precise characterization of exoplanet hosts helps to
bring planet properties like mass, size, and equilibrium temperature into
sharper focus and probes the physical processes that form planets. I studied
the abundance of carbon and oxygen in over 1000 nearby stars using optical
spectra taken by the California Planet Search. I found a large range in the
relative abundance of carbon and oxygen in this sample, including a handful of
carbon-rich stars. I also developed a new technique called SpecMatch for
extracting fundamental stellar parameters from optical spectra. SpecMatch is
particularly applicable to the relatively faint planet-hosting stars discovered
by Kepler.

Using a novel approach, we recover discrete photon statistics from the
cumulants of a continuous distribution of field quadrature measurements. The
use of cumulants allows the separation between the signal of interest and
experimental noise. Using a parametric amplifier as the first stage of the

  Recognition and Action Unit Detection",,,,,"cs.CV cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated recognition of facial expressions of emotions, and detection of
facial action units (AUs), from videos depends critically on modeling of their
dynamics. These dynamics are characterized by changes in temporal phases
(onset-apex-offset) and intensity of emotion expressions and AUs, the
appearance of which may vary considerably among target subjects, making the
recognition/detection task very challenging. The state-of-the-art Latent
Conditional Random Fields (L-CRF) framework allows one to efficiently encode
these dynamics through the latent states accounting for the temporal
consistency in emotion expression and ordinal relationships between its
intensity levels, these latent states are typically assumed to be either
unordered (nominal) or fully ordered (ordinal). Yet, such an approach is often
too restrictive. For instance, in the case of AU detection, the goal is to
discriminate between the segments of an image sequence in which this AU is
active or inactive. While the sequence segments containing activation of the
target AU may better be described using ordinal latent states, the inactive
segments better be described using unordered (nominal) latent states, as no
assumption can be made about their underlying structure (since they can contain
either neutral faces or activations of non-target AUs). To address this, we
propose the variable-state L-CRF (VSL-CRF) model that automatically selects the
optimal latent states for the target image sequence. To reduce the model
overfitting either the nominal or ordinal latent states, we propose a novel
graph-Laplacian regularization of the latent states. Our experiments on three
public expression databases show that the proposed model achieves better
generalization performance compared to traditional L-CRFs and other related
state-of-the-art models.

push these developments even further by exploiting the different modes of a

that allows for the generation of engineered gauge fields. We show how this

delivered to users on demand via Internet. There are several areas that can
benefit from cloud computing and one in special is gaining much attention: the
flash-crowd handling. Flash-crowd events happen when servers are unable to
handle the volume of requests for a specific content (or a set of contents)
that actually reach it, thus causing some requests to be denied. For the
handling of flash-crowd events in Web applications, clouds can offer elastic
computing and storage capacity during these events in order to process all
requests. However, it is important that flash-crowd events are quickly detected
and the amount of resources to be instantiated during flash crowds is correctly
estimated. In this paper, a new mechanism for detection of flash crowds based
on concepts of entropy and total correlation is proposed. Moreover, the
Flash-Crowd Handling Problem (FCHP) is precisely defined and formulated as an
integer programming problem. A new algorithm for solving it, named FCHP-ILS, is
also proposed. With FCHP-ILS the Web provider is able to replicate contents in
the available resources and define the types and amount of resources to
instantiate in the cloud during a flash-crowd event. Finally we present a case
study, based on a synthetic dataset representing flash-crowd events in small
scenarios aiming at comparing the proposed approach with de facto standard
Amazon's Auto Scaling mechanism.

the role of companions in the AGB-pPN transition. We have carried out high
resolution $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ and $^{13}$CO $J=2-1$ observations of CIT 6 with
the Submillimeter Array combined with the Submillimeter Telescope (single-dish)

HC$_3$N segments in a continuous form, and an asymmetric outflow corresponding
to the near-infrared bipolar nebula. Rotation of the $^{12}$CO channel peak
position may be related to the inner spiral winding and/or the bipolar outflow.
An eccentric orbit binary is suggested for the presences of an anisotropic mass
loss to the west and a double spiral pattern. The lack of interarm emission to
the west may indicate a feature corresponding to the periastron passage of a
highly eccentric orbit of the binary. Spatially-averaged radial and spectral
profiles of $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ and $^{13}$CO $J=2-1$ are compared with simple
spherical radiative transfer models, suggesting a change of $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO

millimeter continuum emission is decomposed into extended dust thermal emission
(spectral index $\sim-2.4$) and compact emission from radio photosphere

method when applied to scatter and map plots for three common visualization
goals: regression, density estimation, and clustering. The key to our sampling
method's success is in choosing tuples which minimize a visualization-inspired
loss function. Our user study confirms that optimizing this loss function
correlates strongly with user success in using the resulting visualizations. We
also show the NP-hardness of our optimization problem and propose an efficient
approximation algorithm. Our experiments show that, compared to previous

Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series

weakly ionized, with ionization fraction $f$ as low as $10^{-4}$. In galactic

circumstances, the Hall current can couple low frequency Alfv\'en and
magneto\-acoustic waves via the dimensionless Hall parameter
$\epsilon=\omega/\Omega_\text{i}f$, where $\omega$ is the wave frequency and
$\Omega_\text{i}$ is the mean ion gyrofrequency. This is analysed in the
context of a cold (zero-$\beta$) plasma, and in less detail for a warm plasma.
It is found that Hall coupling preferentially occurs where the wave vector is
nearly field-aligned. In these circumstances, Hall coupling in theory produces
a continual oscillation between fast and Alfv\'en modes as the wave passes
through the weakly ionized region. At low frequencies (mHz), characteristic of
solar and stellar normal modes, $\epsilon$ is probably too small for more than
a fraction of one oscillation to occur. On the other hand, the effect may be
significant at the far higher frequencies (Hz) associated with magnetic
reconnection events. In another context, characteristic parameters for star
forming gas clouds suggest that $\mathcal{O}(1)$ or more full oscillations may
occur in one cloud crossing. This mechanism is not expected to be effective in
sunspots, due to their high ion gyrofrequencies and Alfv\'en speeds, since the
net effect depends inversely on both and therefore inverse quadratically on
field strength.

this paper, we propose a hard decision based CSS algorithm using energy
detection with taking into account the noise uncertainty effect. In the
proposed algorithm, two dynamic thresholds are toggled based on predicting the
current PU activity, which can be successfully expected using a simple
successive averaging process with time. Also, their values are evaluated using
an estimated value of the noise uncertainty factor. These dynamic thresholds
are used to compensate the noise uncertainty effect and increase (decrease) the
probability of detection (false alarm), respectively. Theoretical analysis is
performed on the proposed algorithm to deduce its enhanced false alarm and
detection probabilities compared to the conventional hard decision CSS.

transformations between graph signals. Graph filters can be represented by
matrix polynomials of the graph-shift operator, which captures the structure of
the graph and is assumed to be given. Thus, graph-filter design consists in
choosing the coefficients of these polynomials (known as filter coefficients)
to resemble desired linear transformations. Due to the local structure of the
graph-shift operator, graph filters can be implemented distributedly across
nodes, making them suitable for networked settings. We determine spectral
conditions under which a specific linear transformation can be implemented
perfectly using graph filters. Furthermore, for the cases where perfect
implementation is infeasible, the design of optimal approximations for
different error metrics is analyzed. We introduce the notion of a node-variant
graph filter, which allows the simultaneous implementation of multiple
(regular) graph filters in different nodes of the graph. This additional
flexibility enables the design of more general operators without undermining
the locality in implementation. Perfect and approximate implementation of
network operators is also studied for node-variant graph filters. We
demonstrate the practical relevance of the developed framework by studying in
detail the application of graph filters to the problems of finite-time
consensus and analog network coding. Finally, we present additional numerical
experiments comparing the performance of node-invariant and node-variant

effective quasiparticle interaction should overcome the repulsive Coulomb

alternative pairing mechanism, the excitonic mechanism, was proposed 50 years

mechanism is revisited here and we show that the effective quasiparticle

regular universal patterns, but it is true that people try to find a
satisfactory state of life regarding commute issues. Commute time and distance
are most important indicators to measure the degree of this satisfaction.
Marchetti states a certain regularity in human commute time distribution -
specifically, it states that no matter when, where and how far away people
live, they always tend to spend approximately the same average time for their
daily commute. However, will the rapid development of cities nowadays as well
as serious challenges brought by economic development affect this constant? If
there are novel characteristics? We revisit these problems using fine grained
communication data in two Chinese major cities during recent two years. The
results indicate that the commute time has been slightly increased from
Marchetti's constant with the development of society. People's overall travel
budgets have been increased, more concretely speaking, for medium and long
distance commuters, their endurance limit for commute time is enhanced during
the passing years, and fluctuates around a constant; for short distance
commuters, their commute time increases with the distance. Moreover, the
population distribution in every commute distance shows strong cross-city

discard damaged data regardless of the application's wishes, violating the

gently redesigns a commodity network architecture to support

potentially damaged data. Unlike previous schemes that targeted video or media

operator algebra of observables which has recently been used in experiments

Importantly, this solution makes surprisingly detailed statements about the
relations between measurement outcomes and the unknown target observable. In
the present paper, we investigate this relation by performing a sequence of two
measurements on the polarization of a photon, so that the first measurement
commutes with the target observable and the second measurement is sensitive to
a complementary observable. While the initial measurement can be evaluated
using classical statistics, the second measurement introduces the effects of
quantum correlations between the non-commuting physical properties. By varying
the resolution of the initial measurement, we can change the relative
contribution of the non-classical correlations and identify their role in the
evaluation of the quantum measurement. It is shown that the most striking
deviation from classical expectations is obtained at the transition between
weak and strong measurements, where the competition between different
statistical effects results in measurement values well outside the range of

learning the way in which treatments act against disease. However, pinpointing
such mechanisms is difficult, due to the fact that small perturbations to the
cell can have wide-ranging downstream effects. Given a snapshot of cellular
activity, it can be challenging to tell where a disturbance originated. The
presence of an ever-greater variety of high-throughput biological data offers
an opportunity to examine cellular behavior from multiple angles, but also
presents the statistical challenge of how to effectively analyze data from
multiple sources. In this setting, we propose a method for mechanism-of-action
inference by extending network filtering to multi-attribute data. We first
estimate a joint Gaussian graphical model across multiple data types using
penalized regression and filter for network effects. We then apply a set of
likelihood ratio tests to identify the most likely site of the original
perturbation. In addition, we propose a conditional testing procedure to allow
for detection of multiple perturbations. We demonstrate this methodology on
paired gene expression and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA).

research issue in the field of wireless communication. With the rapid
improvement of various wireless network technologies, it is now possible to
provide high quality video transmission over wireless networks. The high
quality video streams need higher bandwidth. Hence, during the video
transmission through wireless networks, it is very important to make the best
utilization of the limited bandwidth. Therefore, when many broadcasting video
sessions are active, the bandwidth per video session can be allocated based on
popularity of the video sessions (programs). Instead of allocating equal
bandwidth to each of them, our proposed scheme allocates bandwidth per
broadcasting video session based on popularity of the video program. When the
system bandwidth is not sufficient to allocate the demanded bandwidth for all
the active video sessions, our proposed scheme efficiently allocates the total
system bandwidth among all the scalable active video sessions in such a way
that higher bandwidth is allocated to higher popularity one. Using the
mathematical and simulation analyses, we show that the proposed scheme
maximizes the average user satisfaction level and achieves the best utilization
of bandwidth. The simulation results indicate that a large number of
subscribers can receive a significantly improved quality of video. To improve
the video quality for large number of subscribers, the only tradeoff is that a
very few subscribers receive slightly degraded video quality.

limited radio resources that assures the highest standard of Quality of Service

maximum utilization of bandwidth is not only the key issue to be considered,
rather some other factors like interference, call blocking probability etc. are
also needed to keep under deliberation. The lower performances of these factors
may retrograde the overall cellular networks performances. Keeping these
difficulties under consideration, we propose an effective dynamic channel
borrowing model that safeguards better QoS, other factors as well. The proposed
scheme reduces the excessive overall call blocking probability and does
interference mitigation without sacrificing bandwidth utilization. The proposed
scheme is modeled in such a way that the cells are bifurcated after the channel
borrowing process if the borrowed channels have the same type of frequency band
(i.e. reused frequency). We also propose that the unoccupied interfering
channels of adjacent cells can also be inactivated, instead of cell bifurcation
for interference mitigation. The simulation endings show satisfactory
performances in terms of overall call blocking probability and bandwidth
utilization that are compared to the conventional scheme without channel
borrowing. Furthermore, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) level,
capacity, and outage probability are compared to the conventional scheme

the computation of a discrete LBB constant that can be obtained from the
numerical solution of an eigenvalue problem for the Stokes system. This
eigenvalue problem does not fall into a class for which standard results about

under fairly weak conditions on the approximation of the domain, the LBB

image understanding. However, compared with object recognition and scene
recognition, event recognition has received much less research attention in
computer vision community. This paper addresses the problem of cultural event
recognition in still images and focuses on applying deep learning methods on
this problem. In particular, we utilize the successful architecture of
Object-Scene Convolutional Neural Networks (OS-CNNs) to perform event
recognition. OS-CNNs are composed of object nets and scene nets, which transfer
the learned representations from the pre-trained models on large-scale object
and scene recognition datasets, respectively. We propose four types of
scenarios to explore OS-CNNs for event recognition by treating them as either
""end-to-end event predictors"" or ""generic feature extractors"". Our experimental
results demonstrate that the global and local representations of OS-CNNs are
complementary to each other. Finally, based on our investigation of OS-CNNs, we
come up with a solution for the cultural event recognition track at the ICCV

computer [3-5], call for extreme performance in thermal engineering at the
nanoscale [6]. Importantly, quantum mechanics sets a fundamental upper limit
for the flow of information and heat, which is quantified by the quantum of
thermal conductance [7,8]. The physics of this kind of quantum-limited heat
conduction has been experimentally studied for lattice vibrations, or phonons
[9], for electromagnetic interactions [10], and for electrons [11]. However,
the short distance between the heat-exchanging bodies in the previous
experiments hinders the applicability of these systems in quantum technology.
Here, we present experimental observations of quantum-limited heat conduction
over macroscopic distances extending to a metre. We achieved this striking
improvement of four orders of magnitude in the distance by utilizing microwave
photons travelling in superconducting transmission lines. Thus it seems that
quantum-limited heat conduction has no fundamental restriction in its distance.
This work lays the foundation for the integration of normal-metal components
into superconducting transmission lines, and hence provides an important tool
for circuit quantum electrodynamics [12-14], which is the basis of the emerging
superconducting quantum computer [15]. In particular, our results demonstrate
that cooling of nanoelectronic devices can be carried out remotely with the
help of a far-away engineered heat sink. In addition, quantum-limited heat
conduction plays an important role in the contemporary studies of
thermodynamics such as fluctuation relations and Maxwell's demon [16,17]. Here,
the long distance provided by our results may, for example, lead to an ultimate
efficiency of mesoscopic heat engines with promising practical applications

properties of the observed variability in the lag phase of amyloid assembly
currently not accounted for by deterministic nucleation dependent mechanisms,
we formulate a new stochastic minimal model that is capable of describing the

converts a compressable operator to an operator on bundles associated to
completely reducible representations on relative Lie algebra homology groups.
  Applying this machinery to a specific compressable invariant differential

phenomena, and their potential for application is great. However, we understand
the interaction effects unsatisfactorily, and should have clarified issues
about the roles of the Fermi sea term and Fermi surface term of the
conductivity of the intrinsic AHE or SHE of an interacting multiorbital metal
and about the effects of spin-Coulomb drag on the intrinsic SHE. Here we
resolve the first issue and provide the first step about the second issue by
developing a general formalism in the linear response theory with appropriate
approximations and using analytic arguments. The most striking result is that
even without impurities the Fermi surface term, a non-Berry-curvature term,
plays dominant roles at high or slightly low temperatures. In particular, this
Fermi surface term causes the temperature dependence of the dc anomalous Hall
or spin Hall conductivity due to the interaction-induced quasiparticle damping
and the correction of the dc spin Hall conductivity due to the spin-Coulomb
drag. Those results revise our understanding of the intrinsic AHE and SHE. We
also find that the differences between the dc anomalous Hall and longitudinal
conductivities arise from the difference in the dominant multiband excitations.
This not only explains why the Fermi sea term such as the Berry-curvature term
becomes important in clean and low-temperature case only for interband
transports but also provides the useful principles on treating the
electron-electron interaction in an interacting multiorbital metal for general
formalism of transport coefficients. Several correspondences between our
results and experiments are finally discussed.

these classes are equal. Natural generalizations of unit interval graphs called
$k$-length interval graphs were considered in which the number of different
lengths of intervals is limited by $k$. Even after decades of research, no
insight into their structure is known and the complexity of recognition is open
even for $k=2$. We propose generalizations of proper interval graphs called
$k$-nested interval graphs in which there are no chains of $k+1$ intervals
nested in each other. It is easy to see that $k$-nested interval graphs are a
superclass of $k$-length interval graphs.
  We give a linear-time recognition algorithm for $k$-nested interval graphs.
This algorithm adds a missing piece to Gajarsk\'y et al. [FOCS 2015] to show
that testing FO properties on interval graphs is FPT with respect to the
nesting $k$ and the length of the formula, while the problem is W2-hard when

pursue the phaseless reconstruction from far-field data with the help of the

stability analysis of both phased and phaseless problems and compare the degree
of ill-posedness of the phased and phaseless reconstructions. The phaseless
reconstruction is highly nonlinear and much more severely ill-posed. Algorithms
are provided to solve both the phased and phaseless reconstructions in the
linearized case. Stability is studied by estimating the condition number of the
inversion process for both the phased and phaseless cases. An optimal strategy
is suggested to attain the infimum of the condition numbers of the phaseless
reconstruction, which may provide an important guidance for efficient phaseless
measurements in practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, the
stability analysis in terms of condition numbers are new for the phased and
phaseless inverse scattering problems, and are very important to help us
understand the degree of ill-posedness of these inverse problems. Numerical
experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical asymptotic behavior, as
well as the effectiveness and robustness of the phaseless reconstruction

analyze a simplified diffusion model that includes some aspects of a complex
environment in the framework of a nonlinear friction process: at low particle
speeds, friction grows linearly with the particle velocity as for regular
viscous friction; it grows more than linearly at higher particle velocities;
finally, at a maximum of the possible particle speed the friction diverges. In
addition to bare diffusion, we study the influence of a constant drift force
acting on the diffusing particle. While the corresponding stationary velocity
distributions can be derived analytically, the displacement statistics
generally must be determined numerically. However, as a benefit of our model,
analytical progress can be made in one case of a special maximum particle
speed. The effect of a drift force in this case is analytically determined by
perturbation theory. It will be interesting in the future to compare our
results to real experimental systems. One realization could be magnetic
colloidal particles diffusing through a shear-thickening environment such as
starch suspensions, possibly exposed to an external magnetic field gradient.

same sublattice move towards the value of the magnetic moment per isolated
vacancy with the increase of the distance between the vacancies, which is
ascribed to the different contributions due to $\pi$ electrons. Moreover, it is
also found that the local magnetic moments for vacancies in the same sublattice
are in parallel configuration, while they have different orientations when the
vacancies are created in different sublattices. So, our findings have clearly
evidenced how difficult it would be to observe experimentally the emergence of
magnetic order in graphene-based systems containing randomly created atomic
vacancies, since the energy difference between cases of antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic order decreases quickly with the increase in the distance
separating each vacancy pair.

relatively high luminosity RIAF are dominated by the inverse Compton emission
with a sharp, super-exponential cut-off in the very-high-energy gamma-ray band.
The cut-off energy is determined by the properties of the RIAF and is largely
independent of the structure of magnetosphere and geometry of the gap.The
spectra of the gap residing in low-luminosity RIAFs are dominated by
synchrotron / curvature emission with the spectra extending into 1-100 GeV

supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946, the prototype of the small class of

Using Suzaku and deep XMM-Newton observations, we have extracted X-ray spectra
from the softest area, finding clear line features at 1 keV and 1.35 keV. These
lines can be best explained as Ne Ly-alpha and Mg He-alpha from a thermal
emission component. Since the abundance ratios of metals to Fe are much higher
than solar values in the thermal component, we attribute the thermal emission
to reverse-shocked SN ejecta. The measured Mg/Ne, Si/Ne, and Fe/Ne ratios of
2.0-2.6, 1.5-2.0, and <0.05 solar suggest that the progenitor star of RX
J1713.7-3946 was a relatively low-mass star (<~20 M_sun), consistent with a
previous inference based on the effect of stellar winds of the progenitor star
on the surrounding medium. Since the mean blastwave speed of ~6000 km/s (the
radius of 9.6 pc divided by the age of 1600 yr) is relatively fast compared
with other core-collapse SNRs, we propose that RX J1713.7-3946 is a result of a
Type Ib/c supernova whose progenitor was a member of an interacting binary.
While our analysis provides strong evidence for X-ray line emission, our
interpretation of its nature as thermal emission from SN ejecta requires
further confirmation especially through future precision spectroscopic

modeling the traffic patterns of large scale towers deployed in a metropolitan
city. To achieve this goal, we need to address several challenges, including
lack of appropriate tools for processing large scale traffic measurement data,
unknown traffic patterns, as well as handling complicated factors of urban
ecology and human behaviors that affect traffic patterns. Our core contribution
is a powerful model which combines three dimensional information (time,
locations of towers, and traffic frequency spectrum) to extract and model the
traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers. Our empirical analysis
reveals the following important observations. First, only five basic
time-domain traffic patterns exist among the 9,600 cellular towers. Second,
each of the extracted traffic pattern maps to one type of geographical
locations related to urban ecology, including residential area, business
district, transport, entertainment, and comprehensive area. Third, our
frequency-domain traffic spectrum analysis suggests that the traffic of any
tower among the 9,600 can be constructed using a linear combination of four
primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors. We believe that
the proposed traffic patterns extraction and modeling methodology, combined
with the empirical analysis on the mobile traffic, pave the way toward a deep
understanding of the traffic patterns of large scale cellular towers in modern
metropolis.

its detectability. The quantum discord of inflationary perturbations is
calculated for an arbitrary splitting of the system, and shown to be very large
on super-Hubble scales. This entails the presence of large quantum
correlations, due to the entangled production of particles with opposite
momentums during inflation. To determine how this is reflected at the
observational level, we study whether quantum correlators can be reproduced by
a non-discordant state, i.e. a state with vanishing discord that contains
classical correlations only. We demonstrate that this can be done for the power
spectrum, the price to pay being twofold: first, large errors in other
two-point correlation functions and second, the presence of intrinsic
non-Gaussianity. The detectability of these two features remains to be
determined but could possibly rule out a non-discordant description of the
cosmic microwave background. If one abandons the idea that perturbations should
be modeled by quantum mechanics and wants to use a classical stochastic
formalism instead, we show that any two-point correlators on super-Hubble
scales can be exactly reproduced regardless of the squeezing of the system. The

tasks in music information retrieval. The specific case of flamenco singing
transcription poses a particular challenge due to its complex melodic
progressions, intonation inaccuracies, the use of a high degree of
ornamentation and the presence of guitar accompaniment. In this study, we
explore the limitations of existing state of the art transcription systems for
the case of flamenco singing and propose a specific solution for this genre: We
first extract the predominant melody and apply a novel contour filtering
process to eliminate segments of the pitch contour which originate from the
guitar accompaniment. We formulate a set of onset detection functions based on
volume and pitch characteristics to segment the resulting vocal pitch contour
into discrete note events. A quantised pitch label is assigned to each note
event by combining global pitch class probabilities with local pitch contour
statistics. The proposed system outperforms state of the art singing
transcription systems with respect to voicing accuracy, onset detection and
overall performance when evaluated on flamenco singing datasets.

investigating the linear stability of two main classes of forces, parameter
regions with unstable homogeneous states are identified. In this unstable
regime it is then checked whether phase transitions or stop-and-go waves occur.
Results based on numerical simulations show, however, that the investigated
models lead to unrealistic behavior in form of backwards moving pedestrians and
overlapping. This is one reason why stop-and-go waves have not been observed in
these models. The unrealistic behavior is not related to the numerical
treatment of the dynamic equations but rather indicates an intrinsic problem of
this model class. Identifying the underlying generic problems gives indications
how to define models that do not show such unrealistic behavior. As an example
we introduce a new force-based model which produces realistic jam dynamics

partly segmental (VFT kinetics) featuring magnetic-field tunability, whereas in
the LS/IS-spin disordered state above 30K, it is uncorrelated (Arrhenic
kinetics) and almost impervious to the H-field. Kinetics-switchover defines the
dipolar-glass transition temperature Tg(H), below which the
magneto-thermally-activated cooperative relaxations freeze-out by the VFT
temperature T_0(H). Applied H-field facilitates thermally-activated SST and
accelerates the dipolar relaxations; a critical 5T field collapsing the entire

optical elements (e.g. mirrors, lenses, etc.) and to steer light beams with

resonators, e.g. iterative ray tracing or generalized ray transfer matrices,
are either computationally expensive or rely on overparametrized models of
optical elements. By exploiting Fermat's principle, we develop a novel method
to compute the steady-state beam configurations in resonant optical cavities
formed by spherical mirrors, as a function of mirror positions and curvature
radii. The proposed procedure is based on the geometric Newton method on matrix
manifold, a tool with second order convergence rate that relies on a second

parametrize the beam position on mirror surfaces, the computation of the second
order model does not involve the second derivatives of the parametrization.
With the help of numerical tests, we show that the convergence properties of
our procedure hold for non-planar polygonal cavities, and we assess the

$n$-step random walk in $R^d$ does not contain the origin, under the assumption
that the distribution of increments of the walk is centrally symmetric and puts
no mass on affine hyperplanes. This extends the formula by Sparre Andersen
(1949) for the probability that such random walk in dimension one stays
positive. Our result is distribution-free, that is, the probability does not
depend on the distribution of increments.
  This probabilistic problem is shown to be equivalent to either of the two
geometric ones: 1) Find the number of Weyl chambers of type $B_n$ intersected
by a generic linear subspace of $R^n$ of codimension $d$; 2) Find the conic
intrinsic volumes of a Weyl chamber of type $B_n$. We solve the first geometric
problem using the theory of hyperplane arrangements. A by-product of our method
is a new simple proof of the general formula by Klivans and Swartz (2011)
relating the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a linear
hyperplane arrangement to the conic intrinsic volumes of the chambers
constituting its complement.
  We obtain analogous distribution-free results for Weyl chambers of type
$A_{n-1}$ (yielding the probability of absorption of the origin by the convex
hull of a generic random walk bridge), type $D_n$, and direct products of Weyl
chambers (yielding the absorption probability for the joint convex hull of
several random walks or bridges). The simplest case of products of the form
$B_1\times \dots \times B_1$ recovers the Wendel formula (1962) for the
probability that the convex hull of an i.i.d. multidimensional sample chosen
from a centrally symmetric distribution does not contain the origin.
  We also give an asymptotic analysis of the obtained absorption probabilities
as $n \to \infty$, in both cases of fixed and increasing dimension $d$.

different perturbative and phenomenological models with measurements from
$N$-body simulations obtained with a modal bispectrum estimator. Using shape
and amplitude correlators, we directly compare simulated data with theoretical
models over the full three-dimensional domain of the bispectrum, for different
redshifts and scales. We review and investigate the main perturbative methods
in the literature that predict the one-loop bispectrum: standard perturbation
theory, effective field theory, resummed Lagrangian and renormalised
perturbation theory, calculating the latter also at two loops for some triangle
configurations. We find that effective field theory (EFT) succeeds in extending
the range of validity furthest into the mildly nonlinear regime, albeit at the
price of free extra parameters requiring calibration on simulations. For the
more phenomenological halo model, we confirm that despite its validity in the
deeply nonlinear regime it has a deficit of power on intermediate scales, which
worsens at higher redshifts; this issue is ameliorated, but not solved, by
combined halo-perturbative models. We show from simulations that in this
transition region there is a strong squeezed bispectrum component that is
significantly underestimated in the halo model at earlier redshifts. We thus
propose a phenomenological method for alleviating this deficit, which we
develop into a simple phenomenological ""three-shape"" benchmark model based on
the three fundamental shapes we have obtained from studying the halo model.
When calibrated on the simulations, this three-shape benchmark model accurately
describes the bispectrum on all scales and redshifts considered, providing a
prototype bispectrum HALOFIT-like methodology that could be used to describe
and test parameter dependencies.

resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the highest challenges in
magnetic microscopy. Recent development in dynamical-decoupling- (DD) enhanced
diamond quantum sensing has enabled single-nucleus NMR and nanoscale NMR.
Similar to conventional NMR and MRI, current DD-based quantum sensing utilizes
the frequency fingerprints of target nuclear spins. The frequency fingerprints
by their nature cannot resolve different nuclear spins that have the same noise
frequency or differentiate different types of correlations in nuclear-spin
clusters, which limit the resolution of single-molecule MRI. Here we show that
this limitation can be overcome by using wave-function fingerprints of target
nuclear spins, which is much more sensitive than the frequency fingerprints to
the weak hyperfine interaction between the targets and a sensor under resonant
DD control. We demonstrate a scheme of angstrom-resolution MRI that is capable
of counting and individually localizing single nuclear spins of the same
frequency and characterizing the correlations in nuclear-spin clusters. A
nitrogen-vacancy-center spin sensor near a diamond surface, provided that the
coherence time is improved by surface engineering in the near future, may be
employed to determine with angstrom resolution the positions and conformation
of single molecules that are isotope labeled. The scheme in this work offers an
approach to breaking the resolution limit set by the frequency gradients in
conventional MRI and to reaching the angstrom-scale resolution.

conditions of the forcing notion are themselves classes) in the context of an
extension of Morse-Kelley class theory, called MK$^{**}$. We define this
forcing by using a symmetry between MK$^{**}$ models and models of ZFC$^-$ plus
there exists a strongly inaccessible cardinal (called SetMK$^{**}$). We develop
a coding between $\beta$-models $\mathcal{M}$ of MK$^{**}$ and transitive
models $M^+$ of SetMK$^{**}$ which will allow us to go from $\mathcal{M}$ to
$M^+$ and vice versa. So instead of forcing with a hyperclass in MK$^{**}$ we
can force over the corresponding SetMK$^{**}$ model with a class of conditions.
For class-forcing to work in the context of ZFC$^-$ we show that the
SetMK$^{**}$ model $M^+$ can be forced to look like $L_{\kappa^*}[X]$, where
$\kappa^*$ is the height of $M^+$, $\kappa$ strongly inaccessible in $M^+$ and
$X\subseteq\kappa$. Over such a model we can apply definable class forcing and
we arrive at an extension of $M^+$ from which we can go back to the
corresponding $\beta$-model of MK$^{**}$, which will in turn be an extension of
the original $\mathcal{M}$. Our main result combines hyperclass forcing with
coding methods of [BJW82] and [Fri00] to show that every $\beta$-model of
MK$^{**}$ can be extended to a minimal such model of MK$^{**}$ with the same
ordinals. A simpler version of the proof also provides a new and analogous
minimality result for models of second-order arithmetic.

the resulting Smarr relation is a direct consequence of the Lifshitz Cardy

case of electrically charged Lifshitz black holes satisfying as well a Smarr

energy and the charge of the ground state which is played by a magnetically
charged soliton obtained through a double Wick rotation. The expression also
involves a factor multiplying the chemical potentials which varies in function
of the electromagnetic theory considered. This factor is precisely the one that
appears in the Smarr formula for charged Lifshitz black holes. We test the
validity of this Cardy formula in different situations where electrically
Lifshitz charged black holes satisfying a Smarr relation are known. We then
extend these results to electrically charged black holes with hyperscaling

complex-valued functions defined on finite (or, more generally, locally
compact) groups. A simple Fourier-analytic argument yields an inverse theorem,
which shows that a bounded function with a large $U^2$ norm defined on a finite
Abelian group must correlate significantly with a character. In this paper we
generalize this statement to functions that are defined on arbitrary finite
groups and that take values in M$_n(\mathbb C)$. The conclusion now is that the
function correlates with a representation -- though with the twist that the
dimension of the representation is shown to be within a constant of $n$ rather
than being exactly equal to $n$. There are easy examples that show that this
weakening of the obvious conclusion is necessary. The proof is much less
straightforward than it is in the case of scalar functions on Abelian groups.
  As an easy corollary, we prove a stability theorem for near representations.
It states that if $G$ is a finite group and $f:G\to$M$_n(\mathbb C)$ is a
function that is close to a representation in the sense that $f(xy)-f(x)f(y)$
has a small Hilbert-Schmidt norm (also known as the Frobenius norm) for every
$x,y\in G$, then there must be a representation $\rho$ such that $f(x)-\rho(x)$
has small Hilbert-Schmidt norm for every $x$. Again, the dimension of $\rho$
need not be exactly $n$, but it must be close to $n$. We also obtain stability
theorems for other Schatten $p$-norms. A stability theorem of this kind was
obtained for the operator norm by Grove, Karcher and Ruh in 1974 and in a more
general form by Kazhdan in 1982. (For the operator norm, the dimension of the
approximating representation is exactly $n$.)

2MASSJ22560844+5954299 shows the deepest eclipse amongst the known nova-like
stars. It was reproduced by totally covering a very luminous accretion disk by
a red secondary component. The temperature distribution of the disk is flatter
than that of steady-state disk. The target is unusual with the combination of a
low mass ratio q~1.0 (considerably below the limit q=1.2 of stable mass
transfer of CVs) and an M-star secondary. The intensity of the observed three
emission lines, H_alpha, He 5875, and He 6678, sharply increases around phase
0.0, accompanied by a Doppler jump to the shorter wavelength. The absence of
eclipses of the emission lines and their single-peaked profiles means that they
originate mainly in a vertically extended hot-spot halo. The emission H_alpha
line reveals S-wave wavelength shifts with semi-amplitude of around 210 km/s

luminous accretion disk of 2MASSJ22560844+5954299 was attributed to the low

altitude of the coronal X-ray source is observed to increase with energy by
~+0.2 arcsec/keV between 10 and 25 keV. Although an isothermal model can fit
the thermal X-ray spectrum observed by RHESSI, such a model cannot account for

the added value of output products is intended to compensate in time the costs
of temporary binding of input products that initially have their value. The

spin-polarized as a whole. However, it has been recently shown that the
electronic structure in these crystals can in fact show regions of high
spin-polarization, as long as it is probed locally in real and in reciprocal
space. In this article we present the first observation of this type of
compensated polarization in MoS$_2$ bulk crystals. Using spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we directly observed a
spin-polarization of more than 65% for distinct valleys in the electronic band
structure. By additionally evaluating the probing depth of our method we find
that these valence band states at the $\overline{\text{K}}$ point in the
Brillouin zone are close to fully polarized for the individual atomic trilayers
of MoS$_2$, which is confirmed by our density functional theory calculations.
Furthermore, we show that this spin-layer locking leads to the observation of
highly spin-polarized bands in ARPES since these states are almost completely
confined within two dimensions. Our findings prove that these highly desired
properties of MoS$_2$ can be accessed without thinning it down to the monolayer
limit.

developing the ""resource intensity"" indicator. The development of this

restoration (CSR) in the hadronic sector (via the Schwinger mechanism) on top
of the deconfinement phase transition as implemented in PHSD. Especially the
$K^+/\pi^+$ and the $(\Lambda+\Sigma^0)/\pi^-$ ratios in central Au+Au
collisions are found to provide information on the relative importance of both
transitions. The modelling of chiral symmetry restoration is driven by the
pion-nucleon $\Sigma$-term in the computation of the quark scalar condensate
$<q {\bar q}>$ that serves as an order parameter for CSR and also scales
approximately with the effective quark masses $m_s$ and $m_q$. Furthermore, the
nucleon scalar density $\rho_s$, which also enters the computation of $<q {\bar
q}>$, is evaluated within the nonlinear $\sigma-\omega$ model which is
constraint by Dirac-Brueckner calculations and low energy heavy-ion reactions.
The Schwinger mechanism (for string decay) fixes the ratio of strange to light
quark production in the hadronic medium. We find that above $\sim$80 A GeV the
reaction dynamics of heavy nuclei is dominantly driven by partonic
degrees-of-freedom such that traces of the chiral symmetry restoration are hard
to identify. Our studies support the conjecture of 'quarkyonic matter' in

explanation for the maximum in the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio at about 30 A GeV which
only shows up if a transition to partonic degrees-of-freedom is incorporated in

viable progenitor for some Type Ia supernovae. However, it has been argued that
the strong ejecta asymmetries produced by this model might be inconsistent with
the low degree of polarisation typically observed in Type Ia supernova
explosions. Here, we test this claim by carrying out a spectropolarimetric
analysis for the model proposed by Pakmor et al. (2012) for an explosion
triggered during the merger of a 1.1 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.9 M$_{\odot}$
carbon-oxygen white dwarf binary system. Owing to the asymmetries of the
ejecta, the polarisation signal varies significantly with viewing angle. We
find that polarisation levels for observers in the equatorial plane are modest
($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) and show clear evidence for a dominant axis, as a
consequence of the ejecta symmetry about the orbital plane. In contrast,
orientations out of the plane are associated with higher degrees of
polarisation and departures from a dominant axis. While the particular model
studied here gives a good match to highly-polarised events such as SN 2004dt,
it has difficulties in reproducing the low polarisation levels commonly
observed in normal Type Ia supernovae. Specifically, we find that significant
asymmetries in the element distribution result in a wealth of strong
polarisation features that are not observed in the majority of currently
available spectropolarimetric data of Type Ia supernovae. Future studies will
map out the parameter space of the merger scenario to investigate if
alternative models can provide better agreement with observations.

resolutions at which the impact of mesoscale eddies has to be parameterized. We
present results of a state-of-the-art eddy-resolving global ocean model with a
closed Drake Passage, and compare with results of the same model at non-eddying
resolution. An analysis of the pathways of heat by decomposing the meridional
heat transport into eddy, horizontal, and overturning circulation components
indicates that the model behavior on the large scale is qualitatively similar
at both resolutions. Closing Drake Passage induces (i) sea surface warming
around Antarctica due to changes in the horizontal circulation of the Southern
Ocean, (ii) the collapse of the overturning circulation related to North
Atlantic Deep Water formation leading to surface cooling in the North Atlantic,
(iii) significant equatorward eddy heat transport near Antarctica. However,
quantitative details significantly depend on the chosen resolution. The warming
around Antarctica is substantially larger for the non-eddying configuration
(5.5{degree sign}C) than for the eddying configuration (2.5{degree sign}C).
This is a consequence of the subpolar mean flow which partitions differently
into gyres and circumpolar current at different resolutions. We conclude that
for a deciphering of the different mechanisms active in Eocene-Oligocene
climate change detailed analyses of the pathways of heat in the different
climate subsystems are crucial in order to clearly identify the physical

steadily gained importance in statistical modeling and financial applications.
The authors introduce a new semiparametric quantile regression method based on
sequentially fitting a likelihood optimal D-vine copula to given data resulting
in highly flexible models with easily extractable conditional quantiles. As a
subclass of regular vine copulas, D-vines enable the modeling of multivariate
copulas in terms of bivariate building blocks, a so-called pair-copula
construction (PCC). The proposed algorithm works fast and accurate even in high
dimensions and incorporates an automatic variable selection by maximizing the
conditional log-likelihood. Further, typical issues of quantile regression such
as quantile crossing or transformations, interactions and collinearity of
variables are automatically taken care of. In a simulation study the improved
accuracy and saved computational time of the approach in comparison with
established quantile regression methods is highlighted. An extensive financial
application to international credit default swap (CDS) data including stress
testing and Value-at-Risk (VaR) prediction demonstrates the usefulness of the
proposed method.

overproduction of the LSPs. The saxion field can be stabilized with relatively
simple Kahler potentials, not inducing a too large axion dark radiation.
Despite the large entropy production, the observed baryon number is explained
by the Affleck-Dine mechanism. Furthermore, the constraint from isocurvature
perturbations is relaxed, and the Hubble constant during inflation can be as
large as several $\times$ $10^{10}$ GeV.

nearby disc galaxies can be explained by a mean-field dynamo operating in the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Additionally, vertical-flux initial
conditions are potentially able to influence this dynamo via the occurrence of
the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We aim to study the influence of
various initial field configurations on the saturated state of the mean-field
dynamo. This is motivated by the observation that different saturation behavior
was previously obtained for different supernova rates. We perform direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of three-dimensional local boxes of the vertically
stratified, turbulent interstellar medium, employing shearing-periodic boundary
conditions horizontally. Unlike in our previous work, we also impose a vertical
seed magnetic field. We run the simulations until the growth of the magnetic
energy becomes negligible. We furthermore perform simulations of equivalent 1D
dynamo models, with an algebraic quenching mechanism for the dynamo
coefficients. We compare the saturation of the magnetic field in the DNS with
the algebraic quenching of a mean-field dynamo. The final magnetic field
strength found in the direct simulation is in excellent agreement with a
quenched $\alpha\Omega$~dynamo. For supernova rates representative of the Milky
Way, field losses via a Galactic wind are likely responsible for saturation. We
conclude that the relative strength of the turbulent and regular magnetic
fields in spiral galaxies may depend on the galaxy's star formation rate. We
propose that a mean field approach with algebraic quenching may serve as a
simple sub-grid scale model for galaxy evolution simulations including a
prescribed feedback from magnetic fields.

three-dimensional spatio-temporal correlator (STC) that combines the techniques
of holographic correlation and photon echo based temporal pattern recognition.
The STC is shift invariant in space and time. It can be used to recognize
rapidly an event (e.g., a short video clip) that may be present in a large
video file, and determine the temporal location of the event. Using polar
Mellin transform, it is possible to realize an STC that is also scale and
rotation invariant spatially. Numerical simulation results of such a system are
presented using quantum mechanical equations of evolution. For this simulation
we have used the model of an idealized, decay-free two level system of atoms
with an inhomogeneous broadening that is larger than the inverse of the
temporal resolution of the data stream. We show how such a system can be
realized by using a lambda-type three level system in atomic vapor, via
adiabatic elimination of the intermediate state. We have also developed
analytically a three dimensional transfer function of the system, and shown
that it agrees closely with the results obtained via explicit simulation of the
atomic response. The analytical transfer function can be used to determine the
response of an STC very rapidly. In addition to the correlation signal, other
nonlinear terms appear in the explicit numerical model. These terms are also
verified by the analytical model. We describe how the AER can be operated in a
manner such that the correlation signal remains unaffected by the additional
nonlinear terms. We also show how such a practical STC can be realized using a
combination of a porous-glass based Rb vapor cell, a holographic video disc,

simulating particulate and multiphase flows through periodic channels of
arbitrary smooth shape in two dimensions. The authors consider a particular
system---multiple vesicles suspended in a periodic channel of arbitrary
shape---to describe the numerical method and test its performance. Rather than
relying on the periodic Green's function as classical BIE methods do, the
method combines the free-space Green's function with a small auxiliary basis,
and imposes periodicity as an extra linear condition. As a result, we can
exploit existing free-space solver libraries, quadratures, and fast algorithms,
and handle a large number of vesicles in a geometrically complex channel.
Spectral accuracy in space is achieved using the periodic trapezoid rule and
product quadratures, while a first-order semi-implicit scheme evolves particles
by treating the vesicle-channel interactions explicitly. New
constraint-correction formulas are introduced that preserve reduced areas of
vesicles, independent of the number of time steps taken. By using two types of
fast algorithms, (i) the fast multipole method (FMM) for the computation of the
vesicle-vesicle and the vesicle-channel hydrodynamic interaction, and (ii) a
fast direct solver for the BIE on the fixed channel geometry, the computational
cost is reduced to $O(N)$ per time step where $N$ is the spatial discretization
size. Moreover, the direct solver inverts the wall BIE operator at $t = 0$,
stores its compressed representation and applies it at every time step to
evolve the vesicle positions, leading to dramatic cost savings compared to
classical approaches. Numerical experiments illustrate that a simulation with
$N=128, 000$ can be evolved in less than a minute per time step on a laptop.

current multiscale stochastic models, such as stationary random fields, which
are based on precise probability theory, are not capable of correctly
characterizing uncertainty in fiber composites. Next, we motivate the

novel fuzzy-stochastic model, which can more accurately describe uncertainties
in fiber composites. The new model is constructed by combining stochastic
fields and fuzzy variables through a simple calibration-validation approach.
Finally, we construct a global-local multiscale algorithm for efficiently
computing output quantities of interest. The method aims at approximating
required quantities, such as displacements and stresses, in regions of
