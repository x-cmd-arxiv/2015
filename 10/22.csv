Individual abundances are based on high spectral resolution (R ~ 38,000) and
high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ~ 50-300) spectra collected with UVES at ESO
VLT for the DIONYSOS project. Taking account for similar Cepheid abundances
provided either by our group (111 stars) or available in the literature, we end
up with a sample of 435 Cepheids covering a broad range in iron abundances
(-1.6 < [Fe/H] < 0.6). We found, using homogeneous individual distances and
abundance scales, well defined gradients for the above elements. However, the
slope of the light s-process element (Y) is at least a factor of two steeper
than the slopes of heavy s- (La, Ce, Nd) and r- (Eu) process elements. The s to
r abundance ratio ([La/Eu]) of Cepheids shows a well defined anticorrelation
with of both Eu and Fe. On the other hand, Galactic field stars attain an
almost constant value and only when they approach solar iron abundance display
a mild enhancement in La. The [Y/Eu] ratio shows a mild evidence of a
correlation with Eu and, in particular, with iron abundance for field Galactic
stars. We also investigated the s-process index - [hs/ls] - and we found a well
defined anticorrelation, as expected, between [La/Y] and iron abundance.
Moreover, we found a strong correlation between [La/Y] and [La/Fe] and, in
particular, a clear separation between Galactic and Sagittarius red giants.
Finally, the comparison between predictions for low-mass asymptotic giant
branch stars and the observed [La/Y] ratio indicate a very good agreement over
the entire metallicity range covered by Cepheids. However, the observed spread,
at fixed iron content, is larger than predicted by current models.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowdsourcing systems commonly face the problem of aggregating multiple
judgments provided by potentially unreliable workers. In addition, several
aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining
worker's bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge
of the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this
work we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that
simultaneously estimates a task's duration and obtains reliable aggregations of
crowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight
that the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of
the likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses
latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers' completion
time, the tasks' duration and the workers' accuracy. To relate the quality of a
judgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each
task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a
propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are
expected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower
propensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are
assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required
by normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian
inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion
matrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker,
(iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task.
Using two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that
BCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more
informative estimates of a task's duration compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

modulation in the BABAR data on the proton timelike form factors, in the
reaction $e^++e^-$ $\rightarrow$ $\bar{p}+p$. Here we deepen our previous data
analysis, and confirm that in the case of several standard parametrizations it
is possible to write the form factor in the form $F_0$ $+$ $F_{osc}$, where
$F_0$ is a parametrization expressing the long-range trend of the form factor
(for $q^2$ ranging from the $\bar{p}p$ threshold to 36 GeV$^2$), and $F_{osc}$
is a function of the form $\exp(-Bp)\cos(Cp)$, where $p$ is the relative
momentum of the final $\bar{p}p$ pair. Error bars allow for a clean
identification of the main features of this modulation for $q^2$ $<$ 10
GeV$^2$. Assuming this oscillatory modulation to be an effect of final state
interactions between the forming proton and the antiproton, we propose a
phenomenological model based on a double-layer imaginary optical potential.
This potential is flux-absorbing when the distance between the proton and
antiproton centers of mass is $\gtrsim$ 1.7-1.8 fm and flux-generating when it
is $\lesssim$ 1.7-1.8 fm. The main features of the oscillations may be
reproduced with some freedom in the potential parameters, but the transition
between the two layers must be sudden (0-0.2 fm) to get the correct oscillation
period. The flux-absorbing part of the $\bar{p}p$ interaction is due to the
annihilation of $\bar{p}p$ pairs into multi-meson states. We interpret the
flux-creating part of the potential as due to the creation of a $1/q$-ranged
state when the virtual photon decays into a set of current quarks and
antiquarks, including heavy ones, that may exist for a short time. The decay of
these large mass states leads to an intermediate stage regeneration of the
$\bar{p}p$ channel.

version of the model we provide maps of optical depth, average event duration
and event rate for resolved source populations and for difference imaging (DIA)
events. We also compare the predicted event timescale distribution to that
observed. The simulation follows the selection criteria of the MOA-II survey
(Sumi et al. 2013). We modify the Besan\c{c}on model to include M dwarfs and
brown dwarfs. Our best fit model requires a brown dwarf mass function slope of
$-0.4$. The model provides good agreement with the observed average duration,
and respectable consistency with the shape of the timescale distribution
(reduced $\chi^2 \simeq 2.2$). The DIA and resolved source limiting yields
bracket the observed number of events by MOA-II ($2.17\times$ and $0.83\times$

spatial distribution to predict the optical depth and event rate across the
Galactic bulge. The most serious difficulty for the model is that it provides
only $\sim 50\%$ of the measured optical depth and event rate per star at low
Galactic latitude around the inner bulge ($|b|<3{^\circ}$). This discrepancy
most likely is associated with known under-estimated extinction and star counts
in the innermost regions and therefore provides additional support for a

flux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the mass
accretion rate. Here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized X-ray
gas in high-resolution X-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event.
Variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas is
relatively close to the black hole. Narrow line widths indicate that the gas
does not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume filling
factor. Modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second are
observed, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set by
variability. The gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,
super-Eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament of
disrupted stellar gas near to the apocenter of an elliptical orbit. Flows of

scenarios are analyzed: first, based on HI line absorption, assuming a Galactic
origin, we infer a distance upper bound of <2 kpc, which poses a constraint on
the height over the Galactic plane of <200 pc and on the linear size of the
system of <2.3 pc. In this case, the X-ray luminosities are >10^32 erg/s and
>7.5 x 10^32 erg/s, for the point-like and extended sources, respectively;
second, an extra-Galactic nature is discussed, where the point-like source
might be the core of a radio galaxy and the extended source its lobe. In this
case, we compare derived fluxes, spectral indices, and spatial correlation with
those typical from the radio galaxy population, showing the feasibility of this

we suggest that the most promising scenario to explain the nature of these

point-like source is an active galactic nucleus and the extended source
corresponds to the emission from its lobe. Other possibilities include a
PSR/PWN origin, where the radio/X-ray emission originates from the synchrotron

Abelian group $\mathbb{G}$, with particular interest for their so-called
diffraction. Given such a measure $\Lambda$, its diffraction $\widehat{\gamma}$
is another measure on the Pontryagin dual $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$, whose
decomposition into the sum $\widehat{\gamma} = \widehat{\gamma}_{\mathrm{p}}+
\widehat{\gamma}_{\mathrm{c}}$ of its atomic and continuous parts is central in
diffraction theory. The problem we address here is whether the above
decomposition of $\widehat{\gamma}$ lifts to $\Lambda$ itself, that is to say,
whether there exists a decomposition $\Lambda = \Lambda _{\mathrm{p}} + \Lambda
_{\mathrm{c}}$, where $\Lambda _{\mathrm{p}}$ and $\Lambda _{\mathrm{c}}$ are
translation-bounded measures having diffraction $\widehat{\gamma}_{\mathrm{p}}$
and $\widehat{\gamma}_{\mathrm{c}}$ respectively. Our main result here is the
almost sure existence, in a sense to be made precise, of such a decomposition.
It will also be proved that a certain uniqueness property holds for the above
decomposition. Next we will be interested in the situation where
translation-bounded measures are weighted Meyer sets. In this context, it will
be shown that the decomposition, whether it exists, also consists of weighted
Meyer sets. We complete this work by discussing a natural generalization of the
considered problem.

During the endosomal journey, acidification triggers a conformational change of
the virus spike protein hemagglutinin (HA) that results in escape of the viral
genome from the endosome to the cytoplasm. A quantitative understanding of the
processes involved in HA mediated fusion with the endosome is still missing. We
develop here a stochastic model to estimate the change of conformation of HAs
inside the endosome nanodomain. Using a Markov-jump process to model the
arrival of protons to HA binding sites, we compute the kinetics of their
accumulation and the mean first time for HAs to be activated. This analysis
reveals that HA proton binding sites possess a high chemical barrier, ensuring
a stability of the spike protein at sub-acidic pH. Finally, we predict that
activating more than 3 adjacent HAs is necessary to prevent a premature fusion.

Galactic dwarf stars spanning the metallicity range between about one-third and
twice the solar value. We performed a detailed feasibility study about the
effectiveness of the P, S, and Sr line diagnostics in the Y band between 1.03

one-dimensional model atmospheres computed in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE). We computed the line formation assuming LTE for P, while we performed
non-LTE analysis to derive S and Sr abundances. We were able to derive
phosphorus abundance for three stars and an upper limit for one star, while we
obtained the abundance of sulphur and strontium for all of the stars. We find
[P/Fe] and [S/Fe] abundance ratios consistent with solar-scaled or slightly
depleted values, while the [Sr/Fe] abundance ratios are more scattered (by
+/-0.2 dex) around the solar-scaled value. This is fully consistent with
previous studies using both optical and infrared spectroscopy. We verified that
high-resolution, Y-band spectroscopy as provided by GIANO is a powerful tool to
study the chemical evolution of P, S, and Sr in dwarf stars.

waves for advanced ground-based detectors. These mergers are also expected to
power bright electromagnetic signals, in the form of short gamma-ray bursts,
infrared/optical transients, and radio emission. Simulations of these mergers
with fully general relativistic codes are critical to understand the merger and
post-merger gravitational wave signals and their neutrinos and electromagnetic
counterparts. In this paper, we employ the SpEC code to simulate the merger of
low-mass neutron star binaries (two $1.2M_\odot$ neutron stars) for a set of
three nuclear-theory based, finite temperature equations of state. We show that
the frequency peaks of the post-merger gravitational wave signal are in good
agreement with predictions obtained from simulations using a simpler treatment
of gravity. We find, however, that only the fundamental mode of the remnant is
excited for long periods of time: emission at the secondary peaks is damped on
a millisecond timescale in the simulated binaries. For such low-mass systems,
the remnant is a massive neutron star which, depending on the equation of
state, is either permanently stable or long-lived. We observe strong
excitations of l=2, m=2 modes, both in the massive neutron star and in the form
of hot, shocked tidal arms in the surrounding accretion torus. We estimate the
neutrino emission of the remnant using a neutrino leakage scheme and, in one
case, compare these results with a gray two-moment neutrino transport scheme.
We confirm the complex geometry of the neutrino emission, also observed in
previous simulations with neutrino leakage, and show explicitly the presence of
important differences in the neutrino luminosity, disk composition, and outflow
properties between the neutrino leakage and transport schemes.

fully consistent with a recent detection of reappearance. We then construct
catalogs of $z\sim 6-9$ dropout galaxies behind the four clusters and estimate
magnification factors for these dropout galaxies with our best-fitting mass

factor of more than 10. Some of the high-redshift galaxies detected in the HFF

black hole mass and cooling radius at z = 0 for each central galaxy in a dark

upon SAMs and demonstrably place ML as a promising and a computationally

near to their host to have formed in situ, but distant enough to retain a
significant eccentricity in the face of tidal damping. These planets are
curiously absent around stars larger than two solar radii. We hypothesize that
the warm jupiters are migrating due to Kozai-Lidov oscillations, which leads to
transient episodes of high eccentricity and a consequent tidal decay.
  As their host evolves, such planets would be rapidly dragged in or engulfed
at minimum periapse, leading to a rapid depletion of the population with
increasing stellar radius, as is observed. Using numerical simulations, we
determine the relationship between periapse distance and orbital migration rate
for planets 0.1 to 10 Jupiter masses and with orbital periods between 10 and
100 days. We find that Kozai-Lidov oscillations effectively result in planetary
removal early in the evolution of the host star, possibly accounting for the
observed deficit. While the observed eccentricity distribution is inconsistent
with the simulated distribution for an oscillating and migrating warm jupiter
population, observational biases may explain the discrepancy.

very different mass profiles and stellar masses for the Galaxy. The
dark-matter-only version of the Illustris simulation enables us to compute the
effects of galaxy formation on such constraints on a halo-by-halo basis; on
small scales, galaxy formation enhances the density relative to
dark-matter-only runs, while the total mass density is approximately 20% lower
at large Galactocentric distances. We are also able to quantify how current and
future constraints on the mass of the MW within specific radii will be
reflected in uncertainties on its virial mass: even a measurement of M(<50 kpc)
with essentially perfect precision still results in a 20% uncertainty on the
virial mass of the Galaxy, while a future measurement of M(<100 kpc) with 10%

metal line emission from galactic halos in our simulations arises primarily
from collisionally ionized gas and is strongly time variable, with

luminosity correspond closely to massive and energetic mass outflow events,

galactic halos to power the metal line emission. The strong time variability

Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we first estimate distances between opposite
polarity umbrae. Opposite polarity pairs having distances of less that 2
degrees are then identified, and if these pairs are found to share a common
penumbra, they are identified as a magnetic delta configuration. The algorithm
was compared to manual delta detections reported by the Space Weather

right-handed (RH) neutrinos per generation are added to the particles of the
Standard Model (SM), implemented with the symmetry of fermionic contents. The
ordinary one is decoupled via the high scale type-I seesaw mechanism, while the
extra pairs off with its left-handed (LH) partner. The symmetry of lepton and
quark contents was merely used as a guideline to the choice of parameters
because it is not a proper symmetry. Here we argue that the underlying symmetry
to take for this correspondence is presymmetry, the hidden electroweak symmetry
of the SM extended with RH neutrinos defined by transformations which exchange
lepton and quark bare states with the same electroweak charges and no Majorana
mass terms in the underlying Lagrangian. It gives a topological character to
fractional charges, relates the number of families to the number of quark
colors, and now guarantees the great disparity between the couplings of the two
RH neutrinos. Thus, Dirac neutrinos with extremely small masses appear as
natural predictions of presymmetry, satisfying the 't Hooft's naturalness
conditions in the extended seesaw where the extra RH neutrinos serve to
adulterate the mass properties in the low scale effective theory, which retains
without extensions the gauge and Higgs sectors of the SM. However, the high
energy threshold for the seesaw implies new physics to stabilize the quantum
corrections to the Higgs boson mass in agreement with the naturalness
requirement.

(1.5$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{50}$ erg/s, comparable to the highest values observed
by a blazar so far. During the flare the increase of flux was accompanied by a
significant change of the spectral properties. Moreover significant flux
variations on a 6-h time-scale were observed, compatible with the light
crossing time of the event horizon of the central black hole. The broad band
X-ray spectra of PKS 2149-306 observed by Swift-XRT and NuSTAR are well
described by a broken power-law model, with a very hard spectrum ($\Gamma$$_1$

$\Gamma$$_2$ $\sim$ 1.4-1.5 above the break energy. The steepening of the

the small variability amplitude and the lack of spectral changes in that part

to develop versatile tools to quantify the constraining power and consistency

the relative entropy to compute the information gained by Bayesian updates in
units of bits. This measure quantifies both the improvement in precision and
the 'surprise', i.e. the tension arising from shifts in central values. Our
starting point is a WMAP9 prior which we update with observations of the
distance ladder, supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and weak
lensing as well as the 2015 Planck release. We consider the parameters of the
flat $\Lambda$CDM concordance model and some of its extensions which include
curvature and Dark Energy equation of state parameter $w$. We find that,
relative to WMAP9 and within these model spaces, the probes that have provided
the greatest gains are Planck (10 bits), followed by BAO surveys (5.1 bits) and
SNe experiments (3.1 bits). The other cosmological probes, including weak
lensing (1.7 bits) and {$\rm H_0$} measures (1.7 bits), have contributed
information but at a lower level. Furthermore, we do not find any significant
surprise when updating the constraints of WMAP9 with any of the other
experiments, meaning that they are consistent with WMAP9. However, when we
choose Planck15 as the prior, we find that, accounting for the full
multi-dimensionality of the parameter space, the weak lensing measurements of
CFHTLenS produce a large surprise of 4.4 bits which is statistically
significant at the 8 $\sigma$ level. We discuss how the relative entropy
provides a versatile and robust framework to compare cosmological probes in the
context of current and future surveys.

changes in noise level. We show how the sensitivity optimization can be
decoupled from the data selection problem. To find optimal semicoherent search
parameters we apply a numerical optimization using as example the semicoherent

Thus the outcome of the numerical optimization consists of the optimal search

procedure under ideal conditions and show that we can reproduce the results of
the analytical method. Then we gradually relax the conditions on the data and
find that a compact data selection algorithm yields higher sensitivity compared

massive star (VMS) after a giant eruption -- i.e., following a supernova
impostor event. Beginning with reasonable models for evolved VMSs with masses
of $80~M_\odot$ and $120~M_\odot$, we simulate the change of state caused by a
giant eruption via two methods that explicitly conserve total energy: 1.
Synthetically removing outer layers of mass of a few $M_\odot$ while reducing
the energy of the inner layers. 2. Synthetically transferring energy from the
core to the outer layers, an operation that automatically causes mass ejection.
Our focus is on the aftermath, not the poorly-understood eruption itself. Then,
using a radiation-hydrodynamic code in 1D with realistic opacities and
convection, the interior disequilibrium state is followed for about 200 years.
Typically the star develops a $\sim 400 ~\rm{km}~\rm{s}^{-1}$ wind with a mass
loss rate that begins around $0.1 ~M_\odot~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and gradually
decreases. This outflow is driven by $\kappa$-mechanism radial pulsations. The
1D models have regular pulsations but 3D models will probably be more chaotic.
In some cases a plateau in the mass-loss rate may persist about 200 years,
while other cases are more like $\eta$ Car which lost $>10~M_\odot$ and then
had an abnormal mass loss rate for more than a century after its eruption. In
our model, the post-eruption outflow carried more mass than the initial
eruption. These simulations constitute a useful preliminary reconnaissance for
3D models which will be far more difficult.

fits to the multiple asymmetric transits that we observe, we confirm that the
transit egress timescale is usually longer than the ingress timescale, and that
the transit duration is longer than expected for a solid body at these short
periods, all suggesting that these objects have cometary tails streaming behind
them. The precise orbital periods of the planetesimals in this system are
unclear from the transit-times, but at least one object, and likely more, have
orbital periods of ~4.5 hours. We are otherwise unable to confirm the specific
periods that have been reported, bringing into question the long-term stability
of these periods. Our high precision photometry also displays low amplitude
variations suggesting that dusty material is consistently passing in front of
the white dwarf, either from discarded material from these disintegrating

transits we observe, we compare the transit depths in the V- and R-bands of our

  inference","4 pages, 4 figures, proceedings of the SF2A meeting, June 2015, in
  the session ""Phenom\`enes dynamiques et atmosph\'eriques, plasmas spatiaux""",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present some new accurate CCD photometry analysis of the white light solar
corona at the time of the last 20 March 2015 total eclipse (airborne
observations on a Falcon 7X and at ground-based Svalbard). We measured coronal
brightness profiles taken along radial directions from 1.001 to 3 solar radii
in the northern, southern and equatorial regions, after removing the F corona
and the sky background. These studies allow to evaluate the density gradients,
structures and temperature heterogeneity, by considering the Thomson scattering
in white light of the K corona and also emissions of the EUV Fe XII 193A (1 to
2 MK) and Fe XI 171/174 (lower temperature) simultaneously observed by SDO/AIA
and SWAP Proba2 space missions. Some dispersion between the regions is noticed.
The limitation of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption in the solar
atmosphere is discussed as well as the contribution of the magnetic field
pressure gradients as illustrated by a comparison with the model stationary
magnetic corona from Predictive Sc. Inc. These results are compared with the
results of the quieter 2010 total solar eclipse corona analyzed with the same
method. This photometric analysis of the inner and intermediate white light
corona will contribute to the preparation of the Aspiics/Proba 3 flying
formation future coronagraphic mission of ESA for new investigation at time of
artificial eclipses produced in Space. Note that Aspiics will also observe in
the He I D3 line at 5876 A, and will record intensities of the Fe XIV line
5303A simultaneously with the analysis of the orange white- light continuum,
including precise polarimetry analysis.

problems leveraging quantum physics. The newest version features over 1000
qubits and was released in August 2015. We were given access to such a machine,
currently hosted at NASA Ames Research Center in California, to explore the
potential for hard optimization problems that arise in the context of
databases.
  In this paper, we tackle the problem of multiple query optimization (MQO). We
show how an MQO problem instance can be transformed into a mathematical formula
that complies with the restrictive input format accepted by the quantum
annealer. This formula is translated into weights on and between qubits such
that the configuration minimizing the input formula can be found via a process
called adiabatic quantum annealing. We analyze the asymptotic growth rate of
the number of required qubits in the MQO problem dimensions as the number of
qubits is currently the main factor restricting applicability. We
experimentally compare the performance of the quantum annealer against other
MQO algorithms executed on a traditional computer. While the problem sizes that
can be treated are currently limited, we already find a class of problem
instances where the quantum annealer is three orders of magnitude faster than
other approaches.

of a next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). The ngVLA is an interferometric
array with 10x larger effective collecting area and 10x higher spatial
resolution than the current VLA and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA),
optimized for operation in the wavelength range 0.3cm to 3cm. The ngVLA opens a
new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and
continuum emission down to milliarcecond resolution, as well as unprecedented
broad band continuum polarimetric imaging of non-thermal processes. The
continuum resolution will reach 9mas at 1cm, with a brightness temperature
sensitivity of 6K in 1 hour. For spectral lines, the array at 1"" resolution
will reach 0.3K surface brightness sensitivity at 1cm and 10 km/s spectral
resolution in 1 hour. These capabilities are the only means with which to
answer a broad range of critical scientific questions in modern astronomy,
including direct imaging of planet formation in the terrestrial-zone, studies
of dust-obscured star formation and the cosmic baryon cycle down to pc-scales
out to the Virgo cluster, making a cosmic census of the molecular gas which
fuels star formation back to first light and cosmic reionization, and novel
techniques for exploring temporal phenomena from milliseconds to years. The
ngVLA is optimized for observations at wavelengths between the superb
performance of ALMA at submm wavelengths, and the future SKA1 at few centimeter
and longer wavelengths. This memo introduces the project. The science
capabilities are outlined in a parallel series of white papers. We emphasize
that this initial set of science goals are simply a starting point for the
project. We invite comment on these programs, as well as new ideas, through our
public forum link on the ngVLA web page https://science.nrao.edu/futures/ngvla

microwave radiation by splitting into multiple peaks with the position and
height depending on the frequency and amplitude of the microwaves. The

from photon-assisted phase-incoherent tunneling of pairs, rather than the more
conventional phase-coherent tunneling of pairs that yields Shapiro steps.

kinematic Sunyaev-Ze\v{l}dovich (kSZ) effect over the redshift range z = 0.4 -
0.7. We use galaxy positions and the continuity equation to obtain a
reconstruction of the line-of-sight velocity field. We stack the cosmic
microwave background temperature at the location of each halo, weighted by the
corresponding reconstructed velocity. The resulting best fit kSZ model is
preferred over the no-kSZ hypothesis at 3.3sigma and 2.9sigma for two
independent velocity reconstruction methods, using 25,537 galaxies over 660

youngest HII regions and high-mass protostellar jets, (2) Unveiling
binary/multiple protostars at higher resolution, (3) Mapping planet formation
regions in nearby disks on scales down to 1 AU, (4) Studying the formation of

and groups of genetically related long-period comets (other than the Kreutz
sungrazing system). Members of a comet pair or group move in nearly identical
orbits and their origin as fragments of a common parent comet is
unquestionable. The only variable is the time of perihelion passage, which
differs from member to member considerably due primarily to an orbital-momentum
increment acquired during breakup. Meter-per-second separation velocities
account for gaps of years or tens of years, thanks to the orbital periods of
many millennia. The physical properties of individual members may not at all be
alike, as illustrated by the trio of C/1988 A1, C/1996 Q1, and C/2015 F3. We
exploit orbital similarity to examine whether the celebrated and as yet
unidentified object, discovered from the Lick Observatory near the Sun at
sunset on 1921 August 7, happened to be a member of such a pair and to track
down the long-period comet to which it could be genetically related. Our search
shows that the Lick object, which could not be a Kreutz sungrazer, was most
probably a companion to comet C/1847 C1 (Hind), whose perihelion distance was
~9 R_sun and true orbital period approximately 8300 years. The gap of 74.4
years between their perihelion times is consistent with a separation velocity
of ~1 m/s that set the fragments apart following the parent's breakup in a
general proximity of perihelion during the previous return to the Sun in the
7th millennium BCE.

years and contains more than 200 nightly averaged velocity measurements for
each star. This means that it is sensitive to both long-period and low-mass
planets and also to the effects induced by stellar activity cycles. We modelled
the data using Keplerian functions that correspond to planetary candidates and
included the short- and long-term effects of magnetic activity. A Bayesian
approach was taken both for the data modelling, which allowed us to include
information from activity proxies such as $\log{(R'_{\rm HK})}$ in the velocity
modelling, and for the model selection, which permitted determining the number
of significant signals in the system. The Bayesian model comparison overcomes
the limitations inherent to the traditional periodogram analysis. We report an
additional super-Earth planet in the HD1461 system. Four out of the six planets

remaining two proposed signals. In particular, we show that when the systematic

short-length packets, it is inefficient to follow the current multiple access
schemes to allocate transmission resources due to heavy signaling overhead. We
propose a non-orthogonal many-access scheme that is well suited for the future
communication systems equipped with many receive antennas. The system is
modeled as having a block-sparsity pattern with unknown sparsity level (i.e.,
unknown number of transmitted messages). Block precoding is employed at each
single-antenna transmitter to enable the simultaneous transmissions of many
users. The number of simultaneously served active users is allowed to be even
more than the number of receive antennas. Sparsity-aware recovery is designed
at the receiver for joint user detection and symbol demodulation. To reduce the
effects of channel fading on signal recovery, normalized block orthogonal
matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm is introduced, and based on its approximate
performance analysis, we develop interference cancellation based BOMP (ICBOMP)
algorithm. The ICBOMP performs error correction and detection in each iteration
of the normalized BOMP. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in small packet services, as well as the advantages of ICBOMP
in improving signal recovery accuracy and reducing computational cost.

monopoles). The term magnetoelectric potential is sometimes used to signify the
magnetic-monopole induced dual to the usual electromagnetic potential. To this
end, we introduce a general theory for describing modes and characteristics of
waveguides based on mixed-monopole materials, with both electric and magnetic
responses. Our theory accommodates exotic media such as double-negative,
near-zero and zero-index materials, and we demonstrate that our general theory
exhibits the electromagnetic duality that would arise if we were to incorporate
magnetic monopoles into the media. We consider linear, homogeneous, isotropic
waveguide materials with slab and cylindrical geometries. To ensure manifest
electromagnetic duality, we construct generic electromagnetic susceptibilities
that are dual in both electric charges and magnetic monopoles using a
generalized Drude-Lorentz model that manifests this duality. Our model reduces
to standard cases in appropriate limits. We consider metamaterials and
metamaterial waveguides, as well as metal guides, as examples of waveguides
constructed of mixed-monopole materials, to show the generality of our
waveguide theory. In particular, we show that, in slab and cylindrical
waveguides, exchanging electric and magnetic material properties leads to the
exchange of transverse magnetic and transverse electric modes and dispersion
equations, which suggests a good test of the potential duality of waveguides.
This theory has the capability to predict waveguide behavior under an exchange

computation in which ancillas are used to mediate gates on a well-isolated
`quantum memory' register and which may be applied to the setting of qubits,
qudits (for $d>2$) or QCVs. More specifically, we present a model in which
universal quantum computation may be implemented on a register using only:
repeated applications of a single fixed two-body ancilla-register interaction
gate, ancillas prepared in a single state, and local measurements of these
ancillas. In order to maintain determinism in the computation, adaptive
measurements via a classical-feedforward of measurement outcomes are used, with
the method similar to that in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). We
show that our model has the same hybrid quantum-classical processing advantages
as MBQC, including the power to implement any Clifford circuit in essentially
one layer of quantum computation. In some physical settings, high-quality
measurements of the ancillas may be highly challenging or not possible, and
hence we also present a globally unitary model which replaces the need for
measurements of the ancillas with the requirement for ancillas to be prepared
in states from a fixed orthonormal basis. Finally, we discuss settings in which
these models may be of practical interest.

price paid for ambiguity on demand distribution over $T$ periods. When there
are guarantees on the latter's separation from the critical newsvendor

Without any prior information on the demand distribution, we show that the

hope for. Simulation studies involving this along with other policies are also

systems) is investigated and a precise relationship between this powerful model
and qudit quantum circuits is derived in terms of computational depth and size
complexity. To facilitate this investigation a qudit `unbounded fan-out'
circuit model, in which a qudit may be quantum-copied into an arbitrary number
of ancillas in a single time-step, is introduced and shown to be capable of
implementing interesting $n$-qudit unitaries in constant depth. A procedure for
reducing the quantum computational depth in the measurement-based model is then
proposed and using this it is then shown that there is a logarithmic depth
separation between the depth complexity of qudit measurement-based computation
and circuits composed of gates act on a bounded number of qudits. The
relationship is made precise by showing that the depth complexity of the qudit
measurement-based model is exactly equivalent to that of unbounded fan-out
circuits. These results illustrate that the well-known advantages inherent in
qubit measurement-based quantum computation are also applicable to the
higher-dimensional generalisation. As qudits are both naturally available and
have been shown to provide fundamental advantages over binary logic encodings,

quantifying the symmetry-breaking properties of both states and operations
relative to a given symmetry. In the special case where the symmetry is the set
of translations generated by a fixed observable, asymmetry can be interpreted
as coherence relative to the observable eigenbasis, and the resource theory of
asymmetry provides a framework to study this notion of coherence. We here show
that this notion of coherence naturally arises in the context of quantum speed
limits. Indeed, the very concept of speed of evolution, i.e., the inverse of
the minimum time it takes the system to evolve to another (partially)
distinguishable state, is a measure of asymmetry relative to the time
translations generated by the system Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the celebrated
Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin speed limits can be interpreted as upper
bounds on this measure of asymmetry by functions which are themselves measures
of asymmetry in the special case of pure states. Using measures of asymmetry
that are not restricted to pure states, such as the Wigner-Yanase skew
information, we obtain extensions of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound which are
significantly tighter in the case of mixed states. We also clarify some
confusions in the literature about coherence and asymmetry, and show that
measures of coherence are a proper subset of measures of asymmetry.

by new physics scenarios are normally carried out resorting to a variety of
probes emerging from the initial state, in the form of single-jet, -photon and
-$Z$ boson signatures. These are particularly effective for models of
Supersymmetry (SUSY) in presence of $R$-parity conservation, owing to the
presence in their spectra of a stable neutralino as dark matter candidate. We
assume here as theoretical framework Supersymmetric ($B-L$) extension of the
Standard Model (BLSSM), wherein a mediator for invisible decays can be $Z'$
boson. The peculiarity of the signal is thus that the final state objects carry
a very large (transverse) missing energy, since the $Z'$ is naturally massive
and constrained by direct searches and electro-weak precision tests to be at
least in TeV scale region. Under these circumstances the efficiency in
accessing the invisible final state and rejecting the standard model background
is very high. This somehow compensates the rather meagre production rates.
Another special feature of this invisible BLSSM signal is its composition,
which is often dominated by sneutrino decays (alongside the more traditional
neutrino and neutralino modes). Sensitivity of the CERN machine to these two
features can therefore help disentangling the BLSSM from more popular SUSY
models. We assess in this analysis the scope of the LHC in establishing the
aforementioned invisible signals through a sophisticated signal-to-background
simulation carried out in presence of parton shower, hadronisation and detector
effects. We find that significant sensitivity exists already after 300
fb$^{-1}$ during Run 2. We find that mono-jet events can be readily accessible
at the LHC, so as to enable one to claim a prompt discovery, while mono-photon
and -$Z$ signals can be used as diagnostic tools of the underlying scenario.

combination with the nontrivial topology has two remarkable consequences: (i)
coexistence of light and heavy surface states at low temperatures. While heavy
surface states are formed directly in the surface layer, light surface states
are formed in the next-nearest surface layer. Furthermore, (ii) with increasing
the temperature, the heavy surface states become incoherent and only light

applicable to the candidate topological Kondo insulator SmB6.

others. 2H-NbS2 is a particular case within the family, because it is the only
one that is superconductor without exhibiting a CDW order. Although no long
range magnetic order was experimentally observed in the TMDC, we show here that
the single monolayer of NbS2 is on the verge of a spin density wave (SDW)

in the NbS2 monolayer in the presence of magnetic defects or within zig-zag
nanoribbons, due to the presence of unpaired electrons. We calculate the real
part of the bare electronic susceptibilty and the corresponding nesting
function of the clean NbS2 monolayer, showing that there are strong electronic
instabilities at the same wavevector asociated with the calculated SDWs, also
corresponding with one of the main nesting vectors of the Fermi surface. We
conclude that the physical mechanism behind the spin-wave instabilities are the
nesting properties, accentuated by the quasi 2D character of this system, and
the rather strong Coulomb interactions of the 4d band of the Nb atom. We also
estimate the amplitude of the spin-fluctuations and find that they are rather

Traditional approaches aim to simultaneously maximize the number of conserved

similarity to higher-order structures and provides a new objective function
that maximizes the number of aligned substructures. This objective function
corresponds to an integer programming problem, which is NP-hard. Consequently,
we identify a closely related surrogate function whose maximization results in
a tensor eigenvector problem. Based on this formulation, we present an
algorithm called Triangular AlignMEnt (TAME), which attempts to maximize the
number of aligned triangles across networks. Using a case study on the
NAPAbench dataset, we show that triangular alignment is capable of producing
mappings with high node correctness. We further evaluate our method by aligning
yeast and human interactomes. Our results indicate that TAME outperforms the
state-of-art alignment methods in terms of conserved triangles. In addition, we
show that the number of conserved triangles is more significantly correlated,
compared to the conserved edge, with node correctness and co-expression of
edges. Our formulation and resulting algorithms can be easily extended to

trajectories over collectors patterned with nano-scale heterogeneity, the
non-uniform distribution of which creates locally attractive and repulsive
areas within the collector. High energy barriers in strong locally repulsive
areas cannot be overcome by Brownian motion, such that particle deposition on
patchy collectors is controlled by spatially varying DLVO interactions and not
by Brownian motion. The overall adhesive behavior of the system remains
unaffected by the introduction of Brownian motion effects in the simulations,

to neglect Brownian motion effects entirely.

adaptive local basis set. We quantify the accuracy of the Hellmann-Feynman
forces for a range of physical systems, benchmarked against converged planewave
calculations, and find that the adaptive local basis set is efficient for both

per atom to attain accuracy required in practice. Since the adaptive local
basis set has implicit dependence on atomic positions, Pulay forces are in
general nonzero. However, we find that the Pulay force is numerically small and
systematically decreasing with increasing basis completeness, so that the

attracted lots of research efforts. Polar codes can be efficiently decoded by
the low-complexity successive cancelation (SC) algorithm and the SC list (SCL)
decoding algorithm. The belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm not only is
an alternative to the SC and SCL decoders, but also provides soft outputs that
are necessary for joint detection and decoding. Both the BP decoder and the
soft cancelation (SCAN) decoder were proposed for polar codes to output soft
information about the coded bits. In this paper, first a belief propagation
decoding algorithm, called reduced complexity soft cancelation (RCSC) decoding
algorithm, is proposed. Let $N$ denote the block length. Our RCSC decoding
algorithm needs to store only $5N-3$ log-likelihood ratios (LLRs),
significantly less than $4N-2+\frac{N\log_2N}{2}$ and $N(\log_2N+1)$ LLRs
needed by the BP and SCAN decoders, respectively, when $N\geqslant 64$.
Besides, compared to the SCAN decoding algorithm, our RCSC decoding algorithm
eliminates unnecessary additions over the real field. Then the simplified SC
(SSC) principle is applied to our RCSC decoding algorithm, and the resulting
SSC-aided RCSC (S-RCSC) decoding algorithm further reduces the computational
complexity. Finally, based on the S-RCSC decoding algorithm, we propose a
corresponding memory efficient decoder architecture, which has better error
performance than existing architectures. Besides, our decoder architecture
consumes less energy on updating LLRs.

Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations taken with OASIS on the William Herschel

outflows across the central regions of the galaxy. The jet-driven outflow in
3C293 is detected along the inner radio lobes with a mass outflow rate ranging
from $\sim 0.05-0.17$ solar masses/yr (in ionised gas) and corresponding
kinetic power of $\sim 0.5-3.5\times 10^{40}$ erg/s. Investigating the
kinematics of the gas surrounding the radio jets (i.e. not directly associated
with the outflow), we find line-widths broader than $300$ km/s up to 5 kpc in
the radial direction from the nucleus (corresponding to 3.5 kpc in the
direction perpendicular to the radio axis at maximum extent). Along the axis of
the radio jet line-widths $>400$ km/s are detected out to 7 kpc from the

nucleus, indicating that the disturbed kinematics clearly extend well beyond
the high surface brightness radio structures of the jets. This is suggestive of
the cocoon structure seen in simulations of jet-ISM interaction and implies
that the radio jets are capable of disturbing the gas throughout the central

Semiconductor quantum dots inserted in photonic structures are ultrabright

they intrinsically generate multiphoton events and hence must be operated at

deterministically fabricated devices is shown to fully cancel charge noise
effects. Under resonant excitation, an indistinguishability of

impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular subject, yet
much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups.
Thus a personality-aware coupled reconstruction loss is utilized to learn the

resonant excitation of the QWs allow us to rule out carrier escape and

To explore the hypothesis of a high concentration of nonradiative defects at
the interfaces between wells and barriers, we analyze Ga- and N-polar QWs
prepared on 6H-SiC as a function of the well width. Intense luminescence is
observed for both Ga- and N polar samples. As expected, the luminescence of the
Ga-polar QWs quenches and red-shifts with increasing well width due to the
quantum confined Stark effect. In contrast, both the intensity and the energy
of the luminescence from the N-polar samples are essentially independent of
well width. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the N-polar QWs
exhibit abrupt interfaces and homogeneous composition, excluding emission from
In-rich clusters as the reason for this anomalous behavior. The microscopic
origin of the luminescence in the N-polar QWs is elucidated using spatially
resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Regardless of well width, the
luminescence is found to not originate from the N-polar QWs, but from the
semipolar facets of v-pit defects. These results cast serious doubts on the
potential of N-polar QWs grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy for

is quite promising as an essential part of multiscale methodology for chemical

interaction potential force field, it uses diagrammatic analysis of the
solvation free energy to derive integral equations for correlation functions
between molecules in solution in the statistical-mechanical ensemble. The
infinite chain of coupled integral equations for many-body correlation
functions is reduced to a tractable form for 2- or 3-body correlations by
applying the so-called closure relations. Solving these equations produces the
solvation structure with accuracy comparable to molecular simulations that have
converged but has a critical advantage of readily treating the effects and
processes spanning over a large space and slow time scales, by far not feasible
for explicit solvent molecular simulations. One of the versions of this
formalism, the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM)
integral equation complemented with the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closure
approximation, yields the solvation structure in terms of 3D maps of
correlation functions, including density distributions, of solvent interaction
sites around a solute (supra)molecule with full consistent account for the
effects of chemical functionalities of all species in the solution. The
solvation free energy and the subsequent thermodynamics are then obtained at

thermodynamic integration analytically.

luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions collected by
the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The signal is defined
by the production of either of the two lightest scalars, h[1] or h[2], via
gluon-gluon fusion and subsequent decay into a pair of the lightest Higgs
bosons, a[1] or h[1]. The h[1] or h[2] boson is identified with the observed
state at a mass of 125 GeV. The analysis searches for decays of the a[1] (h[1])
states into pairs of tau leptons and covers a mass range for the a[1] (h[1])
boson of 4 to 8 GeV. The search reveals no significant excess in data above
standard model background expectations, and an upper limit is set on the signal

combine two novel ideas: the use of lazy deletion and re-insertion to do

of a tree or set of trees to represent a heap. Lazy deletion produces hollow
nodes (nodes without items), giving the data structure its name.

then numerically calculate the Casimir energy between a metallic (gold) sphere

explore its dependence on the sphere radius, grating-sphere separation, and
lateral displacement. We quantitatively investigate the geometrical dependence
of the interaction, which is sensitive to the grating height and filling

force geometric features. To this purpose we mostly concentrate on separations
and sphere radii of the same order of the grating parameters (here of the order
of one micrometer). We also investigate the lateral component of the Casimir
force, resulting from the absence of translational invariance. We compare our
results with those obtained within the proximity force approximation (PFA).
When applied to the sphere only, PFA overestimates the strength of the
attractive interaction, and we find that the discrepancy is larger in the
sphere-grating than in the sphere-plane geometry. On the other hand, when PFA
is applied to both sphere and grating, it provides a better estimate of the
exact results, simply because the effect of a single grating is underestimated,
thus leading to a partial compensation of errors.

require tools to analyze and interpret these, tools to turn the content into
information and knowledge. Topic modeling have been developed to solve these
problems. Topic models such as LDA [Blei et. al. 2003] allow salient patterns
in data to be extracted automatically. When analyzing texts, these patterns are
called topics. Among numerous extensions of LDA, few of them can reliably
analyze multiple groups of documents and extract topic similarities. Recently,
the introduction of differential topic modeling (SPDP) [Chen et. al. 2012]
performs uniformly better than many topic models in a discriminative setting.
  There is also a need to improve the sampling speed for topic models. While
some effort has been made for distributed algorithms, there is no work
currently done using graphical processing units (GPU). Note the GPU framework
has already become the most cost-efficient platform for many problems.
  In this thesis, I propose and implement a scalable multi-GPU distributed
parallel framework which approximates SPDP. Through experiments, I have shown
my algorithms have a gain in speed of about 50 times while being almost as
accurate, with only one single cheap laptop GPU. Furthermore, I have shown the
speed improvement is sublinearly scalable when multiple GPUs are used, while
fairly maintaining the accuracy. Therefore on a medium-sized GPU cluster, the
speed improvement could potentially reach a factor of a thousand.
  Note SPDP is just a representative of other extensions of LDA. Although my
algorithm is implemented to work with SPDP, it is designed to be a general
enough to work with other topic models. The speed-up on smaller collections
(i.e., 1000s of documents), means that these more complex LDA extensions could
now be done in real-time, thus opening up a new way of using these LDA models
in industry.

soft X-rays of the order $10^{-12}$erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ deg$^{-2}$. The
origin of this gas is unclear, but so far numerical models of galactic star
formation have failed to reproduce such a large surface brightness by several
orders of magnitude. In this paper, we analyze simulations of the turbulent,
magnetized, multi-phase interstellar medium including thermal feedback by
supernova explosions as well as cosmic-ray feedback. We include a
time-dependent chemical network, self-shielding by gas and dust, and
self-gravity. Pure thermal feedback alone is sufficient to produce the observed
surface brightness, although it is very sensitive to the supernova rate. Cosmic
rays suppress this sensitivity and reduce the surface brightness because they
drive cooler outflows. Self-gravity has by far the largest effect because it
accumulates the diffuse gas in the disk in dense clumps and filaments, so that
supernovae exploding in voids can eject a large amount of hot gas into the
halo. This can boost the surface brightness by several orders of magnitude.
Although our simulations do not reach a steady state, all simulations produce
surface brightness values of the same order of magnitude as the observations,
with the exact value depending sensitively on the simulation parameters. We
conclude that star formation feedback alone is sufficient to explain the origin
of the hot halo gas, but measurements of the surface brightness alone do not
provide useful diagnostics for the study of galactic star formation.

events by minor bodies and rings, and evaluate their potential scientific
value. These predictions depend critically on accurate a priori knowledge of
the orbit of JWST near the Sun-Earth Lagrange-point 2 (L2). We also explore the
possibility of serendipitous stellar occultations by very small minor bodies as
a by-product of other JWST observing programs. Finally, to optimize the
potential scientific return of stellar occultation observations, we identify
several characteristics of JWST's orbit and instrumentation that should be
taken into account during JWST's development.

investigate the possibility of using chemical tracers to differentiate between
the possible formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs. In this work, we model the
formation of a pre-brown dwarf core through turbulent fragmentation by
following the depth-dependent chemistry in a molecular cloud through the step
change in density associated with an isothermal shock and the subsequent
freefall collapse once a bound core is produced. Trends in the fractional
abundance of molecules commonly observed in star forming cores are then
explored to find a diagnostic for identifying brown dwarf mass cores formed
through turbulence. We find that the cores produced by our models would be
bright in CO and NH$_3$ but not in HCO$^+$. This differentiates them from
models using purely freefall collapse as such models produce cores that would
have detectable transitions from all three molecules.

  We define quantities which measure how ""close"" an arbitrary prime ideal of a

quasi-separated, its separator exists if and only if the schematic closure of
the diagonal projects on both factors by flat morphisms of finite type. In
particular, f admits a separator if T is Noetherian Dedekind and S=Spec(Z), or
if f is \'etale of finite presentation and S is normal. Any normal scheme of
finite type over a Noetherian ring admits an open subset containing all the
points of codimension 1, which has a separator. A contrario, we give several
examples of morphisms f that do not admit a separator.
  As an application, we attach to every smooth scheme T over a normal base S a
morphism to a separated \'etale S-scheme of finite presentation, which is
universal (a kind of separated alternative for ""scheme of connected components

This pebble, called Hypatia, is composed of almost pure carbon. Transmission
Electron Microscopy and X-ray diffraction results reveal that Hypatia is made
of defect-rich diamond containing lonsdaleite and deformation bands. These
characteristics are compatible with an impact origin on Earth and/or in space.
We analyzed concentrations and isotopic compositions of all five noble gases
and nitrogen in several mg sized Hypatia samples. These data confirm that
Hypatia is extra-terrestrial. The sample is rich in trapped noble gases with an
isotopic composition close to the meteoritic Q component. 40Ar/36Ar ratios in
individual steps are as low as 0.4. Concentrations of cosmic-ray produced 21Ne
correspond to a nominal cosmic-ray exposure age of ca. 0.1 Myr if produced in a
typical m-sized meteoroid. Such an atypically low nominal exposure age suggests
high shielding in a considerably larger body. In addition to the Xe-Q
composition, an excess of radiogenic 129Xe (from the decay of extinct 129I) is
observed (129Xe/132Xe = 1.18 +/- 0.03). Two N components are present, an
isotopically heavy component ({\delta}15N = +20 permil) released at low temp.
and a major light component ({\delta}15N = -110 permil) at higher temp. This
disequilibrium in N suggests that the diamonds in Hypatia were formed in space.
Our data are broadly consistent with concentrations and isotopic compositions
of noble gases in at least three different types of carbon-rich meteoritic
materials. However, Hypatia does not seem to be related to any of these
materials, but may have sampled a similar cosmochemical reservoir. Our study
does not confirm the presence of exotic noble gases that led Kramers et al. to
propose that Hypatia is a remnant of a comet that impacted the Earth.

and William Herschel (WHT) Telescopes. After correcting the observations for
the recession velocity of M82 and for Milky Way and host galaxy extinction, we
measured expansion velocities from spectral line blueshifts and
pseudo-equivalent width of the strongest features in the spectra, which gives
an idea on how elements are distributed within the ejecta. We position SN 2014J
in the Benetti (2005), Branch et al. (2006) and Wang et al. (2009) diagrams.
These diagrams are based on properties of the Si II features and provide
dynamical and chemical information about the SN ejecta. The nearby SN 2011fe,
which showed little evidence for reddening in its host galaxy, is shown as a
reference for comparisons. SN 2014J is a border-line object between the
Core-normal (CN) and Broad-line (BL) groups, which corresponds to an
intermediate position between Low Velocity Gradient (LVG) and High Velocity
Gradient (HVG) objects. SN 2014J follows the R(Si II)-\Delta m15 correlation,
which confirms its classification as a relatively normal SN Ia. Our description
of the SN Ia in terms of the evolution of the pseudo-equivalent width of
various ions as well as the position in the various diagrams put this specific
SN Ia into the overall sample of SN Ia.

plays a key role for the wrapping process, besides the size and shape of the
nanoparticles that have been investigated in recent years. For membrane
segments that initially bulge away from nanoparticles by having a mean
curvature of the same sign as the mean curvature of the particle surface, we
find strongly stable partially wrapped states that can prevent full wrapping.
For membrane segments that initially bulge towards the nanoparticles, in
contrast, partially wrapped states can constitute a significant energetic
barrier for the wrapping process.

A Complex in the centre of the Milky Way. The Herschel HIFI is used to search
for the 487 and 774 GHz emission lines of O2. No O2 emission is detected
towards the Sgr A +50 km/s Cloud, but a number of strong emission lines of
methanol (CH3OH) and absorption lines of chloronium (H2Cl+) are observed. A 3
sigma upper limit for the fractional abundance ratio of (O2)/(H2) in the Sgr A
+50 km/s Cloud is found to be X(O2) less than 5 x 10(-8). However, since we can
find no other realistic molecular candidate than O2 itself, we very tentatively
suggest that two weak absorption lines at 487.261 and 487.302 GHz may be caused
by the 487 GHz line of O2 in two foreground spiral arm clouds. By considering
that the absorption may only be apparent, the estimated upper limit to the O2
abundance of less than (10-20) x 10(-6) in these foreground clouds is very
high. This abundance limit was determined also using Odin non-detection limits.
If the absorption is due to a differential Herschel OFF-ON emission, the O2
fractional abundance may be of the order of (5-10) x 10(-6). With the
assumption of pure absorption by foreground clouds, the unreasonably high
abundance of (1.4-2.8) x 10(-4) was obtained. The rotation temperatures for
CH3OH-A and CH3OH-E lines in the +50 km/s Cloud are found to be 64 and 79 K,

are similar to the quantum double models (QDM) of Kitaev where such domain
walls are dynamically generated making them a part of the spectrum. These
systems have a local symmetry and may or may not have a global symmetry leading
to the possibility of a ground state degeneracy arising from both, global
symmetry breaking and a topological degeneracy. The domain wall states now
separate the different topologically ordered phases belonging to the different
sectors controlled by the global symmetry, when present. They have interesting
properties including fusion with the deconfined anyons of the topologically
ordered phase, to either create new domain walls, or their annihilation. They
can also act like a scatterer permuting anyons of the topologically ordered
phases on either side of the domain wall. Thus these domain wall states can be
thought of as a synthetic scatterer which can be created in any part of the
lattice. We show these effects for the simplest case of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
toric code phase decorated with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and then make
remarks about the case when we have the QDM based on two arbitrary groups $G_1$

applied to the special case of two fluids, having in mind the usual radiation

an unambiguous definition of a vacuum state up to the given adiabatic order.
Using this basis, we show that particle creation is well defined for a suitable
choice of vacuum and canonical variables, so that the time evolution of the
corresponding quantum fields is unitary. This provides constraints for setting
initial conditions for an arbitrary number of fluids and background time
evolution. We also show that the common choice of variables for quantization
can lead to an ill-defined vacuum definition. Our formalism is not restricted

star formation in massive, high-redshift galaxies during their major growth
period was truncated when powerful AGNs launched galaxy-wide outflows of gas
that removed large parts of the interstellar medium. The most powerful radio
galaxies at z~2 show clear signatures of such winds, but are too rare to be
good representatives of a generic phase in the evolution of all massive
galaxies at high redshift. Here we present SINFONI imaging spectroscopy of 12
radio galaxies at z~2 that are intermediate between the most powerful radio and
vigorous starburst galaxies in radio power, and common enough to represent a
generic phase in the early evolution of massive galaxies.
  The kinematic properties are diverse, with regular velocity gradients with
amplitudes of Delta v=200-400 km s^-1 as in rotating disks as well as irregular
kinematics with multiple velocity jumps of a few 100 km s^-1. Line widths are
generally high, typically around FWHM=800 km s^-1, consistent with wind
velocities in hydrodynamic models. A broad H-alpha line in one target implies a
black hole mass of a few 10^9 M$_sun. The ratio of line widths, sigma, to bulk
velocity, v, is so large that even the gas in galaxies with regular velocity
fields is unlikely to be gravitationally bound. It is unclear, however, whether
the large line widths are due to turbulence or unresolved, local outflows as
are sometimes observed at low redshifts. Comparison of the kinetic energy with
the energy supply from the AGN through jet and radiation pressure suggests that
the radio source still plays a dominant role for feedback, consistent with
low-redshift radio-loud quasars.

quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's
nonlocality. Experimentally Bell's nonlocality is usually tested by quantum
violation of the Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in the two-qubit
system. Bell's nonlocality is the strongest type of nonlocality, also due this
reason Bell-test experiments have encountered both the locality loophole and
the detection loophole for a very long time. As a weaker nonlocality, EPR
steering naturally escapes from the locality loophole and is correspondingly
easier to be demonstrated without the detection loophole. In this work, we
trigger an extraordinary approach to investigate Bell's nonlocality, which is
strongly based on the EPR steering. We present a theorem, showing that for any
two-qubit state $\tau$, if its mapped state $\rho$ is EPR steerable, then the
state $\tau$ must be Bell nonlocal. The result not only pinpoints a deep
connection between EPR steering and Bell's nonlocality, but also sheds a new
light to realize a loophole-free Bell-test experiment (without the CHSH
inequality) through the violation of steering inequality.

Several new techniques to determine the metallicity of M dwarfs with
better precision have been developed over the last decades. However, most of
these studies were based on empirical methods. In order to enable detailed
abundance analysis, standard methods established for warmer solar-like stars,
i.e. model-dependent methods using fitting of synthetic spectra, still need to
be used. Aims. In this work we continue the reliability confirmation and
development of metallicity determinations of M dwarfs using high- resolution
infrared spectra. The reliability was confirmed though analysis of M dwarfs in
four binary systems with FGK dwarf companions and by comparison with previous
optical studies of the FGK dwarfs. Methods. The metallicity determination was
based on spectra taken in the J band (1.1-1.4 {\mu}m) with the CRIRES
spectrograph. In this part of the infrared, the density of stellar molecular
lines is limited, reducing the amount of blends with atomic lines enabling an
accurate continuum placement. Lines of several atomic species were used to
determine the stellar metallicity. Results. All binaries show excellent
agreement between the derived metallicity of the M dwarf and its binary
companion. Our results are also in good agreement with values found in the
literature. Furthermore, we propose an alternative way to determine the
effective temperature of M dwarfs of spectral types later than M2 through
synthetic spectral fitting of the FeH lines in our observed spectra.
Conclusions. We have confirmed that a reliable metallicity determination of M
dwarfs can be achieved using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We also
note that metallicites obtained with photometric metallicity calibrations
available for M dwarfs only partly agree with the results we obtain from
high-resolution spectroscopy.

laboratories for the study of stellar physics and also delineating the
structure and recent star formation history of the Milky Way. In order to
exploit these opportunities we have undertaken a multi-epoch spectroscopic
survey of the red supergiant dominated young massive clusters thought to be
present at both near and far ends of the Galactic Bar. Significant
spectroscopic variability suggestive of radial pulsations was found for the
yellow supergiant VdBH 222 #505. Follow-up photometric investigations revealed
modulation with a period of ~23.325d; both timescale and pulsational profile
are consistent with a Cepheid classification. As a consequence #505 may be
recognised as one of the longest period Galactic cluster Cepheids identified to
date and hence of considerable use in constraining the bright end of the
period/luminosity relation at solar metallicities. In conjunction with extant
photometry we infer a distance of ~6kpc for VdBH222 and an age of ~20Myr. This
results in a moderate reduction in both integrated cluster mass (~2x10^4Msun)
and the initial stellar masses of the evolved cluster members (~10Msun). As
such, VdBH222 becomes an excellent test-bed for studying the properties of some
of the lowest mass stars observed to undergo type-II supernovae. Moreover, the
distance is in tension with a location of VdBH 222 at the far end of the
Galactic Bar. Instead a birthsite in the near 3kpc arm is suggested; providing
compelling evidence of extensive recent star formation in a region of the inner
Milky Way which has hitherto been thought to be devoid of such activity.

The approach is made possible through a reduction of the water-wave equations
to a complex-valued integral equation that can be studied using the method of
steepest descents. The main result is a theory that establishes a
correspondence between a given physical flow geometry, with the topology of the
Riemann surface formed by the steepest descent paths. Then, when a geometrical
feature of the body is modified, a corresponding change to the Riemann surface
is observed, and the resultant effects to the water waves can be derived. This
visual procedure is demonstrated for the case of two-dimensional free-surface
flow past a surface-piercing ship and over an angled step in a channel.

modes of an uncharged scalar field with mass $m$ around a Schwarzschild black
hole with mass $M$, at zero and non-zero temperatures. The procedure consists
of calculating the energy eigenvalues starting from the exact solutions found
for the dynamics of the scalar field, considering a frequency cutoff in which
the particle is not absorbed by the black hole. From this result, we obtain the
exterior contributions for the vacuum energy associated to the stationary
states of the scalar field, by considering the half-summing of the levels of
energy and taking into account the respective degeneracies, in order to better
capture the nontrivial topology of the black hole spacetime. Then we use the
Riemann's zeta function to regularize the vacuum energy thus found. Such a
regularized quantity is the Casimir energy, whose analytic computation we show
to yield a convergent series. The Casimir energy obtained does not take into
account any boundaries artificially imposed on the system, just the nontrivial
spacetime topology associated to the source and its singularity. We suggest
that this latter manifests itself through the vacuum tension calculated on the
event horizon. We also investigate the problem by considering the thermal
corrections via Helmholtz free energy calculation, computing the Casimir
internal energy, the corresponding tension on the event horizon, the Casimir
entropy, and the thermal capacity of the regularized quantum vacuum, analyzing
their behavior at low and high temperatures, pointing out the thermodynamic
instability of the system in the considered regime, i.e., $mM\ll 1$.

policy for the minimization of the long-term average cost of one-dimensional
diffusion inventory models. The class of such models under consideration have
general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points that are
consistent with the notion that demand should tend to decrease the inventory
level. Characterization of the cost of a general $(s,S)$ policy as a function
$F$ of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear optimization problem over
the ordering levels $s$ and $S$. Existence of an optimizing pair $(s_*,S_*)$ is
established for these models. Using the minimal value $F_*$ of $F$, along with
$(s_*,S_*)$, a function $G$ is identified which is proven to be a solution of a
quasi-variational inequality provided a simple condition holds. At this level
of generality, optimality of the $(s_*,S_*)$ ordering policy is established
within a large class of ordering policies such that local martingale and
transversality conditions involving $G$ hold. For specific models, optimality
of an $(s,S)$ policy in the general class of admissible policies can be
established using comparison results. This most general optimality result is
shown for the classical drifted Brownian motion inventory model with holding
and fixed plus proportional ordering costs and for a geometric Brownian motion
inventory model with fixed plus level-dependent ordering costs. However, for a
drifted Brownian motion process with reflection at $\{0\}$, a new class of
non-Markovian policies is introduced which have lower costs than the $(s,S)$
policies. In addition, interpreting reflection at $\{0\}$ as ""just-in-time""
ordering, a necessary and sufficient condition is given that determines when
just-in-time ordering is better than traditional $(s,S)$ policies.

Littlewood. Namely, suppose $h : \mathbb{R}^2 \to\mathbb{R}^2$ is an
orientation preserving planar homeomorphism, and let $C$ be a continuum such
that $h^{-1}(C)\cup C$ is acyclic. If there is a $c\in C$ such that
$\{h^{-i}(c):i\in\mathbb{N}\}\subseteq C$, or
$\{h^i(c):i\in\mathbb{N}\}\subseteq C$, then $C$ also contains a fixed point of
$h$. Our approach is based on Morton Brown's short proof of the result of
Cartwright and Littlewood. In addition, making use of a linked periodic orbits
theorem of Bonino we also prove a counterpart of the aforementioned result for
orientation reversing homeomorphisms, that guarantees a $2$-periodic orbit in
$C$ if it contains a $k$-periodic orbit ($k>1$).

the computational and memory costs. Here, we overcome this difficulty by
proposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections
literally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory.
This is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering
of coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of
classification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database,
the experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the
corresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for
applications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.
We discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels,
speed, memory consumption and different problems.

aim is to reproduce the large scale structure and the gross properties of dark

structure of the halos. By adjusting global and local time-steps in an N-body
code, we demonstrate that we recover halo masses to better than 0.5% and the
power spectrum to better than 1% both in real and redshift space for k =
1h/Mpc, while requiring a factor of 4 less CPU time. We also calibrate the
redshift spacing of outputs required to generate simulated light cones. We find
that outputs separated by every z = 0.05 allow us to interpolate particle
positions and velocities to reproduce the real and redshift space power spectra
to better than 1% (out to k = 1h/Mpc). We apply these ideas to generate a suite
of simulations spanning a range of cosmologies, motivated by the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) but broadly applicable to future large
scale structure surveys including eBOSS and DESI. As an initial demonstration
of the utility of such simulations, we calibrate the shift in the baryonic
acoustic oscillation peak position as a function of galaxy bias with higher

demonstrates that entanglement can be distributed to at least three user pairs
of a network from a single source. Additionally, we verify for the best
demultiplexer that the violation is maintained when the pairs are distributed
over a total channel attenuation corresponding to 20 km of optical fiber. These

cylinder were placed on his tomb near Syracuse. Usually, it is admitted that to
find this formula, Archimedes used a half polygon inscribed in a semicircle;
then he performed rotations of these two figures to obtain a set of trunks in a
sphere. This set of trunks allowed him to determine the volume. In our opinion,
Archimedes was so clever that he found the proof with shorter demonstration.

women at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step
in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing STEM
fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested
in STEM and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking
Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a STEM major or are dissuaded
from STEM disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on
mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for
academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman
being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for
a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material
well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women
and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find
women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence
than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack
of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of
women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women
in STEM at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that simply
increasing the retention of women starting in college calculus would almost
double the number of women entering the STEM workforce.
