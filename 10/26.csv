largest Lyapunov exponent computational technique. Obtained results show that
besides the usual way where behavior of the system in the presence of external
forces is studied by analyzing its dynamical response function, the largest
Lyapunov exponent analysis can represent a very convenient tool to examine
system dynamics. In the dc driven systems, the critical depinning force for
particular structure could be estimated by computing the largest Lyapunov
exponent. In the dc+ac driven systems, if the substrate potential is the
standard sinusoidal one, calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent offers a
more sensitive way to detect the presence of Shapiro steps. When the amplitude
of the ac force is varied the behavior of the largest Lyapunov exponent in the
pinned regime completely reflects the behavior of Shapiro steps and the
critical depinning force, in particular, it represents the mirror image of the
amplitude dependence of critical depinning force. This points out an advantage
of this technique since by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent in the
pinned regime we can get an insight into the dynamics of the system when
driving forces are applied.

classification applies to all semisimple affine Hecke algebras $\mathcal{H}$,

out to be rational. This implies that for each $b\in \mathcal{B}_{gm}$ there
exists a universal rational constant $d_b$ determining the formal degree in the
family of discrete series characters
$\epsilon(b;\mathbf{v})\operatorname{Ind}_{D}(b;\mathbf{v})$. We will compute

predict values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio up to about 0.05 is presented.
Larger values of this ratio would require unacceptably large running of the
scalar spectral index. The underlying supersymmetric particle physics model
possesses, for the chosen values of the parameters, practically two
inflationary paths, the trivial and the semi-shifted one. The trivial path is
stabilized by supergravity and supports a first stage of inflation with a
limited number of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio can become appreciable
with the scalar spectral index remaining acceptable, as a result of the
competition between the relatively mild supergravity and the strong radiative
corrections to the inflationary potential. The additional number of e-foldings
required for solving the puzzles of hot big bang cosmology are generated by a
second stage of inflation along the semi-shifted path. This is possible only
because the semi-shifted path is almost orthogonal to the trivial one and,
thus, not affected by the strong radiative corrections on the trivial path and
also because the supergravity effects remain mild. The model predicts the
formation of an unstable network of open cosmic strings connecting monopoles to
antimonopoles. This network decays to gravity waves well before recombination
leading to possibly detectable signatures in future space-based laser
interferometer gravitational-wave detectors.

methods to address problems with intractable likelihood. One approach is a set
of algorithms known as Approximate Bayesian Computational (ABC) methods. One of
the problems of these algorithms is that the performance depends on the tuning
of some parameters, such as the summary statistics, distance and tolerance
level. To bypass this problem, Mengersen, Pudlo and Robert (2013) introduced an
alternative method based on empirical likelihood, which can be easily
implemented when a set of constraints, related to the moments of the
distribution, is known. However, the choice of the constraints is sometimes
challenging. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative method based
on a bootstrap likelihood approach. The method is easy to implement and in some
cases it is faster than the other approaches. The performance of the algorithm
is illustrated with examples in Population Genetics, Time Series and Stochastic
Differential Equations. Finally, we test the method on a real dataset.

states of growth, shrinkage and pause. In this paper, we first introduce a
three states random evolution model as a framework for studying MTs dynamics in
three transition states of growth, pause and shrinkage. Then, we introduce a
non-traditional stack run encoding scheme with 5 symbols for detecting
transition states as well as to encode MT experimental data. The peak detection
is carried out in the wavelet domain to effectively detect these three
transition states. One of the added advantages of including peak information
while encoding being that it enables to detect the peaks efficiently and
encodes them simultaneously in the wavelet domain without having the need to do
further processing after the decoding stage. Experimental results show that
using this form of non-traditional stack run encoding has better compression
and reconstruction performance as opposed to traditional stack run encoding and
run length encoding schemes. Parameters for MTs modeled in the three states are
estimated and is shown to closely approximate original MT data for lower
compression rates. As the compression rate increases, we may end up throwing
away details that are required to detect transition states of MTs. Thus,
choosing the right compression rate is a trade-off between admissible level of
error in signal reconstruction, its parameter estimation and considerable rate
of compression of MT data.

biasing and uplink/downlink decoupling. The results show that with the dual
slope path loss models, the bias maximizing the median rate is not optimal for
other users, e.g., edge users. Furthermore, optimal downlink biasing is shown
to realize most of the gains from downlink-uplink decoupling. Moreover, the

generalist predators as biological control agents. Theory suggests, generalist
predators are poor agents for biological control, primarily due to mutual
interference. However field evidence shows they are actually quite effective in
regulating pest densities. In this work we provide a plausible answer to this
paradox. We analyze a three species model, where a generalist top predator is
introduced into an ecosystem as a biological control, to check the population
of a middle predator, that in turn is depredating on a prey species. We show
that the inclusion of predator interference alone, can cause the solution of
the top predator equation to blow-up in finite time, while there is global
existence in the no interference case. This result shows that interference
could actually cause a population explosion of the top predator, enabling it to
control the target species, thus corroborating recent field evidence. Our
results might also partially explain the population explosion of certain
species, introduced originally for biological control purposes, such as the
cane toad (\emph{Bufo marinus}) in Australia, which now functions as a
generalist top predator. We also show both Turing instability and
spatio-temporal chaos in the model. Lastly we investigate time delay effects.

other mathematical devices that serve to pretend that the objects are
indiscernible (when they are not: all objects that obey classical logic are

the particular tissue using LCDM distances. To extract more of the information
provided by LCDM distances, we perform pooling and censoring of LCDM distances.
In particular, we employ Brown-Forsythe (BF) test of homogeneity of variance
(HOV) on the LCDM distances. HOV analysis of pooled distances provides an
overall analysis of morphometric variability of the LCDMs due to the disease in
question, while the HOV analysis of censored distances suggests the location(s)
of significant variation in these differences (i.e., at which distance from the
GM/WM surface the morphometric variability starts to be significant). We also
check for the influence of assumption violations on the HOV analysis of LCDM
distances. In particular, we demonstrate that BF HOV test is robust to
assumption violations such as the non-normality and within sample dependence of
the residuals from the median for pooled and censored distances and are robust
to data aggregation which occurs in analysis of censored distances. We
illustrate the methodology on a real data example, namely, LCDM distances of GM
voxels in ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) to see the effects of
depression or being of high risk to depression on the morphometry of VMPFCs.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering software into peer groups based on its apparent functionality
allows for simple, intuitive categorization of software that can, in
particular, help identify which software uses comparatively more privilege than
is necessary to implement its functionality. Such relative comparison can
improve the security of a software ecosystem in a number of ways. For example,
it can allow market operators to incentivize software developers to adhere to
the principle of least privilege, e.g., by encouraging users to use
alternative, less-privileged applications for any desired functionality. This
paper introduces software peer group analysis, a novel technique to identify
least privilege violation and rank software based on the severity of the
violation. We show that peer group analysis is an effective tool for detecting
and estimating the severity of least privilege violation. It provides
intuitive, meaningful results, even across different definitions of peer groups
and security-relevant privileges. Our evaluation is based on empirically
applying our analysis to over a million software items, in two different online
software markets, and on a validation of our assumptions in a medium-scale user

exchangeable random partitions, but do not require constituent sets to be

One class of such objects, known as Indian buffet processes, has become a
popular tool in machine learning. Based on an equivalence between Indian buffet
and scale-invariant Poisson processes, we identify a random scaling variable
whose role is similar to that played in exchangeable partition models by the
total mass of a random measure. Analogous to the construction of exchangeable
partitions from normalized subordinators, random families of sets can be
constructed from randomly scaled subordinators. Coupling to a heavy-tailed
scaling variable induces a power law on the number of sets containing the first
$n$ elements. Several examples, with properties desirable in applications, are
derived explicitly. A relationship to exchangeable partitions is made precise
as a correspondence between scaled subordinators and Poisson-Kingman measures,
generalizing a result of Arratia, Barbour and Tavare on scale-invariant

expressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn
the attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such
temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example,
many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through
machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we
propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an
expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce
probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe
controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption
that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables.
One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is
adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its
beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We
demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL
specifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and
autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.

photoluminescence of the quantum dot microlens using a square-wave voltage,
single-photon emission is triggered with a response time as short as 270 ps

gating of emission from the quantum dot placed in the intrinsic region of a

executed in two phases, the training phase, which does not recur, and the test
phase. First, the noise-free speech power spectral density (PSD) is modeled as
a MoG, representing the phoneme based diversity in the speech signal. An NN is
then trained with phoneme labeled database for phoneme classification with
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as the input features. Given the
phoneme classification results, a speech presence probability (SPP) is obtained
using both the generative and discriminative models. Soft spectral subtraction
is then executed while simultaneously, the noise estimation is updated. The
discriminative NN maintain the continuity of the speech and the generative
phoneme-based MoG preserves the speech spectral structure. Extensive
experimental study using real speech and noise signals is provided. We also
compare the proposed algorithm with alternative speech enhancement algorithms.

inflow, and is similar in morphology to past observations of the H$\beta$

indispensible in many fields of science including, e.g., electronics, optics,
acoustics, and thermodynamics. Manipulating phonons using such nonreciprocal
devices may have a range of applications such as phonon diodes, transistors,
switches, etc. One way of achieving nonreciprocal phononic devices is to use
materials with strong nonlinear response to phonons. However, it is not easy to
obtain the required strong mechanical nonlinearity, especially for few-phonon
situations. Here, we present a general mechanism to amplify nonlinearity using
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric structures, and show that an on-chip micro-scale
phonon diode can be fabricated using a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mechanical
system, in which a lossy mechanical-resonator with very weak mechanical
nonlinearity is coupled to a mechanical resonator with mechanical gain but no
mechanical nonlinearity. When this coupled system transits from the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime to the broken-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime,
the mechanical nonlinearity is transferred from the lossy resonator to the one
with gain, and the effective nonlinearity of the system is significantly
enhanced. This enhanced mechanical nonlinearity is almost lossless because of
the gain-loss balance induced by the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric structure. Such
an enhanced lossless mechanical nonlinearity is then used to control the
direction of phonon propagation, and can greatly decrease (by over three orders
of magnitude) the threshold of the input-field intensity necessary to observe
the unidirectional phonon transport. We propose an experimentally realizable
lossless low-threshold phonon diode of this type. Our study opens up new
perspectives for constructing on-chip few-phonon devices and hybrid
phonon-photon components.

generated by either a classical or quantum source. In the classical setting,
two honest parties (Alice and Bob) use public discussion and local randomness
to distill secret key from some distribution $p_{XYZ}$ that is shared with an
unwanted eavesdropper (Eve). In the quantum settings, the correlations
$p_{XYZ}$ are delivered to the parties as either an \textit{incoherent} mixture
of orthogonal quantum states or as \textit{coherent} superposition of such
states; in both cases, Alice and Bob use public discussion and local quantum
operations to distill secret key. While the power of quantum mechanics
increases Alice and Bob's ability to generate shared randomness, it also equips
Eve with a greater arsenal of eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, it is not
obvious who gains the greatest advantage for distilling secret key when
replacing a classical source with a quantum one.
  In this paper we first demonstrate that the classical key rate is equivalent
to the quantum key rate when the correlations are generated incoherently in the
quantum setting. For coherent sources, we next show that the rates are
incomparable, and in fact, their difference can be arbitrarily large in either
direction. However, we identify a large class of non-trivial distributions
$p_{XYZ}$ that possess the following properties: (i) Eve's advantage is always
greater in the quantum source than in its classical counterpart, and (ii) for
the quantum entanglement shared between Alice and Bob in the coherent source,
the so-called entanglement cost/squashed entanglement/relative entropy of
entanglement can all be computed. With property (ii), we thus present a rare
instance in which the various entropic entanglement measures of a quantum state

applications of this generalized Kunz-Souillard method to almost periodic
Schr\""odinger operators are presented.
  On the one hand, we show that the Schr\""odinger operators on
$l^2(\mathbb{Z})$ with limit-periodic potential that have pure point spectrum
form a dense subset in the space of all limit-periodic Schr\""odinger operators
on $l^2(\mathbb{Z})$. More generally, for any bounded potential, one can find
an arbitrarily small limit-periodic perturbation so that the resulting operator
has pure point spectrum. Our result complements the known denseness of
absolutely continuous spectrum and the known genericity of singular continuous
spectrum in the space of all limit-periodic Schr\""odinger operators on
$l^2(\mathbb{Z})$.
  On the other hand, we show that Schr\""odinger operators on $l^2(\mathbb{Z})$
with arbitrarily small one-frequency quasi-periodic potential may have pure
point spectrum for some phases. This was previously known only for
one-frequency quasi-periodic potentials with $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ norm exceeding
$2$, namely the super-critical almost Mathieu operator with a typical frequency
and phase. Moreover, this phenomenon can occur for any frequency, whereas no

stripe domains via strong bending or stretching. Our theory provides an
explanation to the experiments and is supported by the new experiments.

becomes strategyproof; we also provide a matching lower bound of $2$ on the

technique of partial measurements. We find that post partial measurement can
greatly enhance the teleported QFI, while the combination of prior partial

teleportation. Our work extends the ability of partial measurements as a

prior distribution, which is expressed as the mixture of a one-point
distribution and a proper prior distribution. In this paper, we develop an
empirical Bayes approach for estimating area-level means, using the uncertain
prior distribution in the context of a natural exponential family, which we
call the empirical uncertain Bayes (EUB) method. The regression model
considered in this paper includes the Poisson-gamma and the binomial-beta, and
the normal-normal (Fay-Herriot) model, which are typically used in small area
estimation. We obtain the estimators of hyperparameters based on the marginal
likelihood by using a well-known Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and
propose the EUB estimators of area means. For risk evaluation of the EUB
estimator, we derive a second-order unbiased estimator of a conditional mean
squared error by using some techniques of numerical calculation. Through
simulation studies and real data applications, we evaluate a performance of the
EUB estimator and compare it with the usual empirical Bayes estimator.

coordinate is ambiguous. We note here, that within the tetrad formalism of
general relativity, it is possible to perform a Wick rotation directly in the
tangent space using considerably less structure: a timelike, future pointing
vector field, which need not be Killing or hypersurface orthogonal. This method
has the advantage of yielding real Euclidean metrics, even in spacetimes which
are not static. When applied to a black hole exterior, the null generators of
the event horizon reduce to points in the Euclidean spacetime. Requiring that
the Wick rotated holonomy of the null generators be trivial ensures the absence
of a `conical singularity' in the Euclidean space. To illustrate the basic

features and distinct from the geography of irradiation, suggesting an
endogenous identity. Identifying the endogenous composition is of particular
interest for revealing the subsurface composition. However, its spectrum is not
consistent with linear mixtures of the salt minerals previously considered
relevant to Europa. The spectrum of this component is distinguished by
distorted hydration features rather than distinct spectral features, indicating
hydrated minerals but making unique identification difficult. In particular, it
lacks features common to hydrated sulfate minerals, challenging the traditional

requires a conversion of the ordinal response to a vector of binary category

assumptions, we adopt the weighted scores method which is essentially an

theoretically sound methodology for analyzing multivariate discrete data based
only on moments up to second order and it is robust to dependence and nearly as
efficient as maximum likelihood. There is no need to convert the ordinal
response to binary indicators, thus the weight matrices have smaller dimensions
and it is not necessary to guess the correlations of indicator variables for
different categories. We focus on important issues that would interest the data

important to investigate morphological properties. In present work, HfO2 thin
films have been deposited at several oblique angles. Morphological statistical

been explained by varying column slanting angle and film porosity with

autonomous robot operating under uncertainty. In its most general form, SLAP
induces a continuous POMDP (partially-observable Markov decision process),
which needs to be repeatedly solved online. This paper addresses this problem
and proposes a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space. The underlying POMDP,
which is continuous in state, action, and observation space, is approximated
offline via sampling-based methods, but operates in a replanning loop online to
admit local improvements to the coarse offline policy. This construct enables
the proposed method to combat changing environments and large localization
errors, even when the change alters the homotopy class of the optimal
trajectory. It further outperforms the state-of-the-art FIRM (Feedback-based
Information RoadMap) method by eliminating unnecessary stabilization steps.
Applying belief space planning to physical systems brings with it a plethora of
challenges. A key focus of this paper is to implement the proposed planner on a
physical robot and show the SLAP solution performance under uncertainty, in
changing environments and in the presence of large disturbances, such as a
kidnapped robot situation.

comprised of a source, an FD relay, and a destination, where a direct
source-destination link does not exist and the FD relay is impaired by residual
self-interference. We adopt the worst-case linear self-interference model with
respect to the channel capacity, and model the residual self-interference as a
Gaussian random variable whose variance depends on the amplitude of the
transmit symbol of the relay. For this channel, we derive the capacity and
propose an explicit capacity-achieving coding scheme. Thereby, we show that the
optimal input distribution at the source is Gaussian and its variance depends
on the amplitude of the transmit symbol of the relay. On the other hand, the
optimal input distribution at the relay is discrete or Gaussian, where the
latter case occurs only when the relay-destination link is the bottleneck link.
The derived capacity converges to the capacity of the two-hop ideal FD relay
channel without self-interference and to the capacity of the two-hop
half-duplex (HD) relay channel in the limiting cases when the residual
self-interference is zero and infinite, respectively. Our numerical results
show that significant performance gains are achieved with the proposed
capacity-achieving coding scheme compared to the achievable rates of
conventional HD relaying and/or conventional FD relaying.

regular, i.e., a finite unranked algebra in which the operations are defined by

of a transmitter nano-machine is signal modulation. In particular, the
transmitter has to be able to control the release of signaling molecules for
modulation of the information bits. An important class of control mechanisms in
natural cells for releasing molecules is based on ion channels which are
pore-forming proteins across the cell membrane whose opening and closing may be
controlled by a gating parameter. In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on
ion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are
released from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal.
Exploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying
modulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal,
i.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is
derived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a
closed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is
obtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released
molecules regardless of this assumption. The derived average modulated signal
is compared to results obtained with a particle based simulator. The numerical
results show that the derived upper bound is tight if the number of ion
channels distributed across the transmitter (cell) membrane is small.

voids using the CO line emission as a tracer. The observations were done using
the 45m Nobeyama Radio Telescope. Void galaxies lie in the most under dense
parts of our universe and a significant fraction of them are gas rich, late
type spiral galaxies. Although isolated, they have ongoing star formation but
appear to be slowly evolving compared to galaxies in denser environments. Not
much is known about their star formation properties or cold gas content. In
this study we searched for molecular gas in five void galaxies. The galaxies
were selected based on their relatively high IRAS fluxes or Ha line
luminosities, both of which signify ongoing star formation. All five galaxies
appear to be isolated and two lie within the Bootes void. We detected CO line
emission from four of the five galaxies in our sample and the molecular gas
masses lie between 10^8 to 10^9 Msolar. We did follow-up Ha imaging
observations of three detected galaxies using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope
and determined their star formation rates (SFRs). The SFR varies from 0.2 to 1
Msolar/yr, which is similar to that observed in local galaxies. Our study
indicates that although void galaxies reside in under dense regions, their
disks contain molecular gas and have star formation rates similar to galaxies
in denser environments.

double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) with an accuracy sufficient to
finally obtain the masses of the components with relative errors as small as 1
% when combined with Gaia astrometric measurements. In order to validate the
masses derived from Gaia, interferometric observations are obtained for three
SB2s in our sample with F-K components: HIP 14157, HIP 20601 and HIP 117186.
The masses of the six stellar components are derived. Due to its edge-on
orientation, HIP 14157 is probably an eclipsing binary. We note that almost all
the derived masses are a few percent larger than the expectations from the
standard spectral-type-mass calibration and mass-luminosity relation. Our
calculation also leads to accurate parallaxes for the three binaries, and the
Hipparcos parallaxes are confirmed.

range of metallicities (Z) and explore the effect of convective boundary mixing
(CBM). With decreasing metallicity and evolution along the TP phase, the
He-shell flash and the third dredge-up (TDU) occur closer together in time.
After some time (depending upon the CBM parameterisation), efficient TDU begins
while the pulse-driven convection zone (PDCZ) is still present, causing a
convective exchange of material between the PDCZ and the convective envelope.
This results in the ingestion of protons into the convective He-burning pulse.
Even small amounts of CBM encourage the interaction of the convection zones
leading to transport of protons from the convective envelope into the He layer.
H-burning luminosities exceed $10^9$ (in some cases $10^{10}$)
$\mathrm{L}_\odot$. We also calculate models of dredge-out in the most massive
super-AGB stars and show that the dredge-out phenomenon is another likely site
of convective-reactive H-$^{12}$C combustion. We discuss the substantial
uncertainties of stellar evolution models under these conditions. Nevertheless,
the simulations suggest that in the convective-reactive H-combustion regime of
H ingestion the star may encounter conditions for the intermediate neutron
capture process (i process). We speculate that some CEMP-s/r stars could
originate in i-process conditions in the H-ingestion phases of low-Z SAGB
stars. This scenario would however suggest a very low electron-capture
supernova rate from super-AGB stars. We also simulate potential outbursts
triggered by such H-ingestion events, present their light curves and briefly

increasing the energy between the ground and first excited states. Our methods
are even more general. They can be used to shift a Hamiltonian's density of
states away from the ground state, so that fewer states occupy the low-lying
energies near the minimum, hence allowing for faster adiabatic passages to find
the ground state with less risk of getting caught in an undesired low-lying
excited state during the passage. Even more generally, our methods can be used
to transform a discrete optimization problem into a new one whose unique
minimum still encodes the desired answer, but with the objective function's
values forming a different landscape. Aspects of the landscape such as the
objective function's range, or the values of certain coefficients, or how many
different inputs lead to a given output value, can be decreased *or* increased.
One of the many examples for which these methods are useful is in finding the
ground state of a Hamiltonian using NMR: If it is difficult to find a molecule
such that the distances between the spins match the interactions in the
Hamiltonian, the interactions in the Hamiltonian can be changed without at all
changing the ground state. We apply our methods to an AQC algorithm for integer
factorization, and the first method reduces the maximum runtime in our example
by up to 754%, and the second method reduces the maximum runtime of another
example by up to 250%. These two methods may also be combined.

dataset of almost 400 convex shape models and their rotation states. This
amount already provided a deep insight into physical properties of main-belt
asteroids or large collisional families. We aim to increase the number of
asteroid shape models and rotation states. Such results are an important input
for various further studies such as analysis of asteroid physical properties in
different populations, including smaller collisional families, thermophysical
modeling, and scaling shape models by disk-resolved images, or stellar
occultation data. This provides, in combination with known masses, bulk density
estimates, but constrains also theoretical collisional and evolutional models
of the Solar System. We use all available disk-integrated optical data (i.e.,
classical dense-in-time photometry obtained from public databases and through a
large collaboration network as well as sparse-in-time individual measurements
from a few sky surveys) as an input for the convex inversion method, and derive
3D shape models of asteroids, together with their rotation periods and
orientations of rotation axes. The key ingredient is the support of more that
one hundred observers who submit their optical data to publicly available
databases. We present updated shape models for 36 asteroids, for which mass
estimates are currently available in the literature or their masses will be
most likely determined from their gravitational influence on smaller bodies,
which orbital deflection will be observed by the ESA Gaia astrometric mission.
This was achieved by using additional optical data from recent apparitions for
the shape optimization. Moreover, we also present new shape model
determinations for 250 asteroids, including 13 Hungarias and 3 near-Earth

the STM spectra are shown to consist of a complicated superposition of orbital
contributions, with different orbital symmetries, self-energies and Kondo
temperatures. For the Mn adatom, which is close to half-filling, the STM
spectra are featureless near the Fermi level. On the other hand, the
quasiparticle peak for Co adatom gives rise to strongly position-dependent Fano
line-shapes.

the following variation on the random geometric graph: in each of $n$ rounds in
total, a player is offered two random points from the unit square, and has to
select exactly one of these two points for inclusion in the evolving geometric
graph. We study the problem of avoiding a linear-sized (or ""giant"") component
in this setting. Specifically, we show that for any $r\ll(n\log\log n)^{-1/3}$
there is a strategy that succeeds in keeping all component sizes sublinear,
with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$. We also show that this is
tight in the following sense: for any $r\gg(n\log\log n)^{-1/3}$, the player
will be forced to create a component of size $(1-o(1))n$, no matter how he
plays, again with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$. We also prove
that the corresponding offline problem exhibits a similar threshold behaviour
at $r(n)=\Theta(n^{-1/3})$. These findings should be compared to the existing
results for the (ordinary) random geometric graph: there a giant component
arises with high probability once $r$ is of order $n^{-1/2}$. Thus, our results
show, in particular, that in the geometric setting the power of choices can be
exploited to a much larger extent than in the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
random graph, where the appearance of a giant component can only be delayed by
a constant factor.

coherent dynamics from environmental noise. Here, we propose a concept of

sufficiently strong driving fields to suppress the effect of environmental
noise, while at the same time being insusceptible to both the amplitude and
phase noise in the continuous driving fields. This combination of robust
features significantly enhances coherence times under realistic conditions, and
at the same time provides new flexibility in Hamiltonian engineering that
otherwise is not achievable. We demonstrate theoretically applications of our

physical systems of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and of trapped ions.

'Kuranishi spaces' were introduced in the work of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono in
symplectic geometry (see e.g. arXiv:1503.07631), as the geometric structure on
moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves. We propose a new definition of
Kuranishi space, which has the nice property that they form a 2-category $\bf
Kur$. Thus the homotopy category Ho$({\bf Kur})$ is an ordinary category of
Kuranishi spaces.
  Any Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono (FOOO) Kuranishi space $\bf X$ can be made into a
compact Kuranishi space $\bf X'$ uniquely up to equivalence in $\bf Kur$ (that
is, up to isomorphism in Ho$({\bf Kur})$), and conversely any compact Kuranishi
space $\bf X'$ comes from some (nonunique) FOOO Kuranishi space $\bf X$. So
FOOO Kuranishi spaces are equivalent to ours at one level, but our definition
has better categorical properties. The same holds for McDuff and Wehrheim's
'Kuranishi atlases' in arXiv:1508.01556.
  Using results of Yang on polyfolds and Kuranishi spaces surveyed in
arXiv:1510.06849, a compact topological space $X$ with a 'polyfold Fredholm
structure' in the sense of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder (see e.g.
arXiv:1407.3185) can be made into a Kuranishi space $\bf X$ uniquely up to
equivalence in $\bf Kur$.
  Our Kuranishi spaces are based on the author's theory of Derived Differential
Geometry (see e.g. arXiv:1206.4207), the study of classes of derived manifolds
and orbifolds that we call 'd-manifolds' and 'd-orbifolds'. There is an
equivalence of 2-categories ${\bf Kur}\simeq{\bf dOrb}$, where $\bf dOrb$ is
the 2-category of d-orbifolds. So Kuranishi spaces are really a form of derived
orbifold. We discuss the differential geometry of Kuranishi spaces.

spins in antiparallel between $n$-mers and along $a$-axis. Among them, the
lowest energy states are quasi-degenerate staggered dimer and staggered trimer
AFM states as well as their any staggered combinations. Thus, to have the
largest entropy to minimize the free energy at low temperature, the most
favorable state is such a quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet in which along
$b$-axis a variety of $n$-mers, mostly dimers and trimers, are randomly
antiparallel aligned while along $a$-axis spins are antiparallel aligned, i.e.
actually a nematic paramagnet. This finding accounts well for the absence of
long-range magnetic order in bulk FeSe and meanwhile indicates the dominant
stripe spin fluctuation and the nematicity as spin-driven.

was a signature of an orbital period; the longer period was possibly due to
precession of an accretion disk and KIC 9202990 was a cataclysmic variable with
an accretion disk which is always in a bright state (a nova-like system). Using
the full Kepler dataset on KIC 9202990 which covers 1421 d (Quarter 2--17), and
includes 1 min cadence data from the whole of Quarters 5 and 16, we find that
the 4 hr period is stable and therefore a signature of the binary orbital
period. In contrast, the 10--12 d period is not stable and shows an amplitude
between 20--50 percent. This longer period modulation is similar to those
nova-like systems which show `stunted' outbursts. We discuss the problems that
a precessing disk model has in explaining the observed characteristics and
indicate why we favour a stunted outburst model. Although such stunted events
are considered to be related to the standard disk instability mechanism, their
origin is not well understood. KIC 9202990 shows the lowest amplitude and
shortest period of continuous stunted outburst systems, making it an ideal
target to better understand stunted outbursts and accretion instabilities in

which is perturbed by a passing star on a parabolic orbit. The aim is to test
whether a single stellar flyby is capable to excite significant disc
inclinations which would favour the formation of so-called misaligned planets.
We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study inclination, disc mass and
angular momentum changes of the disc for passing stars with different masses.
We explore different orbital configurations for the perturber's orbit to find
the parameter spaces which allow significant disc inclination generation.
Prograde inclined parabolic orbits are most destructive leading to significant
disc mass and angular momentum loss. In the remaining disc, the final disc
inclination is only below $20^\circ$. This is due to the removal of disc
particles which have experienced the strongest perturbing effects. Retrograde
inclined parabolic orbits are less destructive and can generate disc
inclinations up to $60^\circ$. The final disc orientation is determined by the
precession of the disc angular momentum vector about the perturber's orbital
angular momentum vector and by disc orbital inclination changes.
  We propose a sequence of stellar flybys for the generation of misalignment
angles above $60^\circ$. The results taken together show that stellar flybys
are promising and realistic for the explanation of misaligned Hot Jupiters with
misalignment angles up to 60\degr.

forces, is revisited using modern NN potentials and their low-momentum
equivalent interactions, detailed account of the saturation curve of the Ch-EFT

it to an effective two-body interaction by folding the third nucleon degrees of
freedom. Uncertainties due to the choice of the 3NF low-energy constants $c_D$

that the self-dual Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski metric can be brought into the

We show that the self-dual Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution admits two
independent Killing spinors in the framework of $N=2$ minimal gauged
supergravity, whereas the non-self-dual solution admits only a single Killing
spinor. This can be demonstrated by casting the self-dual
Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski metric into two distinct Przanowski-Tod forms. As a
by-product, a new example of the three-dimensional Einstein-Weyl space is
presented. We also prove that the self-dual Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski metric
falls into two different Calderbank-Pedersen families, which are determined by
a single function subjected to a linear equation on the two dimensional
hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we consider the hyper-K\""ahler case for which
the metric falls into the Gibbons-Hawking class. We find that the condition for
the nonexistence of Dirac-Misner string enforces the solution with a
nonvanishing acceleration parameter to the Eguchi-Hanson space.

that estimating content popularities becomes essential to manage and distribute

content popularities from a traffic trace.
  Specifically, we consider the problem of the popularity inference in order to
tune content-level performance models, e.g. caching models. In this context,
special care must be brought on the fact that an observer measures only the
flow of requests, which differs from the model parameters, though both
quantities are related by the model assumptions. Current studies, however,
ignore this difference and use the observed data as model parameters. In this
paper, we highlight the inverse problem that consists in determining parameters
so that the flow of requests is properly predicted by the model. We then show
how such an inverse problem can be solved using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
Based on two large traces from the Orange network and two synthetic datasets,
we eventually quantify the importance of this inversion step for the
performance evaluation accuracy.

This allows us to utilize state-of-the-art undirected MST algorithms whose run

tree is then inferred from the undirected MST and is subsequently improved with
respect to the directed parsing model through local greedy updates, both steps
running in O(n) time. In experiments with 18 languages, a variant of the

corresponding surface quasi-geostrophic case. Results show that, while surface
quasi-geostrophic dynamics is dominated by a symmetric population of
cyclones-anticyclones, surface semi-geostrophic dynamics features a more
prominent role of fronts and filaments. The resulting distribution of potential
temperature is strongly skewed and peaked at non-zero values at and close to
the active boundary, while symmetry is restored in the interior of the domain,
where small-scale frontal structures do not penetrate. In surface
semi-geostrophic turbulence energy spectra are less steep than in the surface
quasi-geostrophic case, with more energy concentrated at small scales for
increasing Rossby number. Energy connected to frontal structures, lateral
strain rate and vertical velocities are largest close to the active boundary.
These results show that the semi-geostrophic model could be of interest for

  International Cosmic Ray Conference, The Hague, The Netherlands",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The positron fraction in cosmic rays was found to be steadily increasing in
function of energy, above $\sim$10 GeV. This behaviour contradicts standard
astrophysical mechanisms, in which positrons are secondary particles, produced
in the interactions of primary cosmic rays during the propagation in the
interstellar medium. The observed anomaly in the positron fraction triggered a
lot of excitement, as it could be interpreted as an indirect signature of the
presence of dark matter species in the Galaxy. Alternatively, it could be
produced by nearby astrophysical sources, such as pulsars. Both hypotheses are
probed in this work in light of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction
measurements. The transport of primary and secondary positrons in the Galaxy is
described using a semi-analytic two-zone model. MicrOMEGAs is used to model the
positron flux generated by dark matter species. We provide mass and
annihilating cross section that best fit AMS-02 data for each single
annihilating channel as well as for combinations of channels. We find that the
mass of the favoured dark matter candidates is always larger than 500 GeV. The
description of the positron fraction from astrophysical sources is based on the
pulsar observations included in the ATNF catalogue. The region of the
distance-to-age plane that best fits the positron fraction for a single source
is determined and a list of five pulsars from the ATNF catalogue is given.
Those results are obtained with the cosmic ray transport parameters that best
fit the B/C ratio. Uncertainties in the propagation parameters turn out to be
very significant.

convolutional neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance for image
classification and retrieval problems. It has also been shown that the
activations from the convolutional layers can be interpreted as local features
describing particular image regions. These local features can be aggregated
using aggregation approaches developed for local features (e.g. Fisher
vectors), thus providing new powerful global descriptors.
  In this paper we investigate possible ways to aggregate local deep features
to produce compact global descriptors for image retrieval. First, we show that
deep features and traditional hand-engineered features have quite different
distributions of pairwise similarities, hence existing aggregation methods have
to be carefully re-evaluated. Such re-evaluation reveals that in contrast to
shallow features, the simple aggregation method based on sum pooling provides
arguably the best performance for deep convolutional features. This method is
efficient, has few parameters, and bears little risk of overfitting when e.g.
learning the PCA matrix. Overall, the new compact global descriptor improves
the state-of-the-art on four common benchmarks considerably.

F\tilde{F} term highly suppressed in the QCD Lagrangian when it seems necessary
to explain why there are three and not four light pions? The most elegant
solution posits a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry which
requires the existence of the axion field a. The axion field settles to the
minimum of its potential thus removing the offensive term but giving rise to
the physical axion whose coherent oscillations can make up the cold dark
matter. Only now are experiments such as ADMX beginning to explore QCD axion
parameter space. Since a bonafide scalar particle-- the Higgs boson-- has been
discovered, one might expect its mass to reside at the axion scale f_a~ 10^{11}
GeV. The Higgs mass is elegantly stabilized by supersymmetry: in this case the
axion is accompanied by its axino and saxion superpartners. Requiring
naturalness also in the electroweak sector implies higgsino-like WIMPs so then
we expect mixed axion-WIMP dark matter. Ultimately we would expect detection of
both an axion and a WIMP while signals for light higgsinos may show up at LHC

for a largely unexploited reef fish, we found both population density and
stochastic food supply impacted adult survival. The estimated effect of
variable survival on adult abundance (both mean and variability) rivaled that
of variable recruitment. Moreover, we show density dependent adult survival can
dampen impacts of stochastic recruitment. Thus, food variability may alter
population fluctuations by simultaneously regulating recruitment and
compensatory adult survival. These results provide an additional mechanism for
why intensified density independent mortality (via harvest or other means)
amplifies population fluctuations and emphasizes need for research evaluating
the causes and consequences of variability in adult survival.

reduce decoding latency of polar decoders, maximum likelihood (ML) decoding
units are used by successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders as well as
successive cancellation (SC) decoders. This paper proposes an approximate ML
(AML) decoding unit for SCL decoders first. In particular, we investigate the
distribution of frozen bits of polar codes designed for both the binary erasure
and additive white Gaussian noise channels, and take advantage of the
distribution to reduce the complexity of the AML decoding unit, improving the
area efficiency of SCL decoders. Furthermore, a multi-mode SCL decoder with
variable list sizes and parallelism is proposed. If high throughput or small
latency is required, the decoder decodes multiple received codewords in
parallel with a small list size. However, if error performance is of higher
priority, the multi-mode decoder switches to a serial mode with a bigger list
size. Therefore, the multi-mode SCL decoder provides a flexible tradeoff
between latency, throughput and error performance, and adapts to different
throughput and latency requirements at the expense of small overhead. Hardware
implementation and synthesis results show that our polar decoders not only have

theory methods in the low energy domain involve two different aspects:
dependence of the quantities of interest on the quark masses and dependence on
the momenta. While the lattice approach gives an excellent handle on the low
energy constants that govern the quark mass dependence, the most efficient tool
to pin down the momentum dependence is dispersion theory. At the same time, the
dispersive analysis enlarges the energy range where the effective theory
applies. In the meson sector, the interplay of the various sources of
information has led to a coherent framework that describes the low energy
structure at remarkably high resolution. The understanding of the low energy
properties in the baryon sector is less well developed. There is significant
progress in the dispersive analysis of $\pi N$ scattering, for example, but it

regular observations of comet C/2013 A1(Siding Spring) with TRAPPIST in Chile,
along with low-resolution spectra obtained with the ESO/VLT FORS 2 instrument.
The comet made a close approach to Mars on October 19, 2014 and was then
observed by many space and ground-based telescopes. We followed the evolution
of the OH, NH, CN, $\mathrm{C_3}$, and $\mathrm{C_2}$ production rates as well
as the $Af\rho$ parameter as a proxy for the dust production. We detected an
outburst two weeks after perihelion, with gas and dust production rates being
multiplied by a factor five within a few days. By modelling the shape of the CN
and $\mathrm{C_2}$ radial profiles, we determined that the outburst happened
around on November 10 around 15:30 UT ($\pm$ 5h) and measured a gas ejection
velocity of $1.1\pm0.2$ km/s. We used a thermal evolution model to reproduce
the activity pattern and outburst. Our results are consistent with the
progressive formation of a dust mantle explaining the shallow dependence of gas
production rates, which may be partially blown off during the outburst. We
studied the evolution of gas composition, using various ratios such as CN/OH,
$\mathrm{C_2}$/OH, or $\mathrm{C_3}$/OH, which showed little or no variation
with heliocentric distance including at the time of the outburst. This
indicates a relative level of homogeneity of the nucleus composition.

nuclear saturation density, that the high-density equation of state is limited
by causality and the largest high-accuracy neutron star mass measurement, and
that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity. We explore the role
of prior assumptions by considering two classes of equation of state models. In
a first, the intermediate- and high-density behavior of the equation of state
is parameterized by piecewise polytropes. In the second class, the high-density
behavior of the equation of state is parameterized by piecewise continuous line
segments. The smallest density at which high-density matter appears is varied
in order to allow for strong phase transitions above the nuclear saturation
density. We critically examine correlations among the pressure of matter,
radii, maximum masses, the binding energy, the moment of inertia, and the tidal
deformability, paying special attention to the sensitivity of these
correlations to prior assumptions about the equation of state. It is possible
to constrain the radii of $1.4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ neutron stars to a be larger
than 10 km, even without consideration of additional astrophysical
observations, for example, those from photospheric radius expansion bursts or
quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. We are able to improve the accuracy of known
correlations between the moment of inertia and compactness as well as the
binding energy and compactness. We also demonstrate the existence of a
correlation between the neutron star binding energy and the moment of inertia.

nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) with a focus on improving the robustness
and reliability of the solution, which is a challenging task in computational
science and engineering. The proposed algorithm utilizes the Rayleigh-Ritz
procedure to compute all eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors lying
within a given contour in the complex plane. The main novelties are the
following. First and foremost, the approximate eigenspace is constructed by
using the values of the resolvent at a series of sampling points on the
contour, which effectively circumvented the unreliability of previous schemes
that using high-order contour moments of the resolvent. Secondly, an improved
Sakurai-Sugiura algorithm is proposed to solve the projected NEPs with
enhancements on reliability and accuracy. The user-defined probing matrix in
the original algorithm is avoided and the number of eigenvalues is determined
automatically by provided strategies. Finally, by approximating the projected
matrices with the Chebyshev interpolation technique, RSRR is further extended
to solve NEPs in the boundary element method, which is typically difficult due
to the densely populated matrices and high computational costs. The good
performance of RSRR is demonstrated by a variety of benchmark examples and
large-scale practical applications, with the degrees of freedom ranging from
several hundred up to around one million. The algorithm is suitable for
parallelization and easy to implement in conjunction with other programs and
software.

Re-evaluating the bar for energy disaggregation","Under submission to Percom 2016",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the early 1980s, the research community has developed ever more
sophisticated algorithms for the problem of energy disaggregation, but despite
decades of research, there is still a dearth of applications with demonstrated
value. In this work, we explore a question that is highly pertinent to this
research community: how good does energy disaggregation need to be in order to
infer characteristics of a household? We present novel techniques that use
unsupervised energy disaggregation to predict both household occupancy and
static properties of the household such as size of the home and number of
occupants. Results show that basic disaggregation approaches performs up to 30%
better at occupancy estimation than using aggregate power data alone, and are
up to 10% better at estimating static household characteristics. These results
show that even rudimentary energy disaggregation techniques are sufficient for
improved inference of household characteristics. To conclude, we re-evaluate
the bar set by the community for energy disaggregation accuracy and try to
answer the question ""how good is good enough?""

explore how metadynamics heals mollification artifacts, how healing impacts
convergence time, and whether alternative temperings may be used to improve
efficiency. We introduce ""$\mu$-tempered"" metadynamics as a simple tempering
scheme, inspired by a related mollified adaptive biasing potential (mABP), that
results in artifact independent convergence of the free energy estimate. We use
a toy model to examine the role of artifacts in WTmetaD and solvated alanine
dipeptide to compare the well-tempered and $\mu$-tempered frameworks

Energy (PLECHDE) model in the framework of a non-flat Universe and of
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmology with infrared cut-off given by recently proposed
Granda-Oliveros cut-off, which contains one term proportional to the Hubble
parameter squared $H^2$ and one term proportional to the first time derivative
of the Hubble parameter $\dot{H}$. Moreover, this cut-off is characterized by
two constant parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. For the two cases corresponding
to non-interacting and interacting DE and Dark Matter (DM), we derive the
evolutionary form of the energy density of DE $\Omega_D'$, the Equation of
State (EoS) parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$.
Using the parametrization of the EoS parameter
$\omega_D\left(z\right)=\omega_0+\omega_1 z$, we obtain the expressions of the
two parameters $\omega_0$ and $\omega_1$. We also study the statefinder
parameters $\left\{ r,s \right\}$, the snap and lerk cosmographic parameters
and the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$. We also calculate the values of the
quantities we study for different values of the running parameter $\lambda$ and
for different set of values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

  arXiv:1404.2491",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we investigate the implications of the LHC Higgs data on
different BSM scenarios. Since the data seem to agree with the SM expectations,
any nonstandard couplings will be strongly constrained. First we investigate,
in a model independent way, the constraints on the nonstandard Higgs couplings
with the fermions and the vector bosons in view of high energy unitarity and
the measured value of the Higgs to diphoton signal strength. Then we
concentrate on a particular BSM scenario, namely, the two Higgs-doublet models
(2HDMs). Consistency of the Higgs data with the corresponding SM predictions
strongly motivates us to work in the {\em alignment limit}. In this limit,
including the informations of Higgs mass and its SM-like nature, we find many
new constraints on the nonstandard masses and $\tan\beta$. We also study the
constraints on the charged scalar mass arising from the $h\to \gamma\gamma$
signal strength measurements and observe that the charged scalar does not
necessarily decouple from the diphoton decay width. We then move on to some
particular variants of 2HDMs, known as BGL models, and study the flavor
constraints on these models. Here we find that lighter than conventionally
allowed nonstandard scalars can successfully negotiate the stringent bounds
coming from flavor physics data and can leave unconventional decay signatures
that can be used as distinctive features of these models. We also analyze the
stability and unitarity constraints in a three Higgs-doublet model (3HDM) with
$S_3$ symmetry and find that there must be many more nonstandard particles
below 1~TeV. We also observe that the nondecoupling feature of the charged
scalar in the context of $h\to \gamma\gamma$ is not unique to the 2HDMs only,
instead it is a general property of the multi doublet extensions of the SM with
an exact discrete symmetry.

  Disaggregation","Under submission to IPSN 2016",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate whether ""big-data"" is more valuable than
""precise"" data for the problem of energy disaggregation: the process of
breaking down aggregate energy usage on a per-appliance basis. Existing
techniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1
minute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per
month, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new
technique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring'
homes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The
key intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy
consumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home
with a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e.
power meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist.
Then, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to
be the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes
and results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in
comparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend
on manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show
that Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy disaggregating fridge
and heating/cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM.
Furthermore, it achieves up to 64% accuracy on washing machine, dryer,
dishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported
results. Many existing techniques are not able to disaggregate these loads at
all. These results indicate a potentially substantial advantage to installing
submetering infrastructure in a select few homes rather than installing new
high-frequency smart metering infrastructure in all homes.
