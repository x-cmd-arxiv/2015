clear that the contribution from the orbital angular momentum of the quarks and
gluons has to be included as well. For instance, the sea quark orbital
contribution remains largely unexplored. Measurements accessing the sea quark
Sivers distribution will provide a probe of the sea quark orbital contribution.
The upcoming E1039 experiment at Fermilab will access this distribution via the
Drell-Yan process using a 120 GeV unpolarized proton beam directed on a
polarized proton target. At E1039 kinematics the $u$-$\bar{u}$ annihilation
process dominates the Drell-Yan cross section ($x_{Target}$ = 0.1 $\sim$ 0.35).
If the $\bar{u}$ quark carries zero net angular momentum, then the measured
Drell-Yan single-spin asymmetry should be zero, and vice versa. This experiment
is a continuation of the currently running SeaQuest experiment.

recordings, EEG/MEG, and the local field potential. They have been linked to
the population firing rate of neurons, with individual neurons firing in a
close-to-irregular fashion at low rates. Using a combination of mean-field and
linear response theory we predict the spectra generated in a layered
microcircuit model of V1, composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and
based on connectivity compiled from anatomical and electrophysiological
studies. The model exhibits low- and high-gamma oscillations visible in all
populations. Since locally generated frequencies are imposed onto other
populations, the origin of the oscillations cannot be deduced from the spectra.
We develop an universally applicable systematic approach that identifies the
anatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations in a given
network. Based on a theoretical reduction of the dynamics, we derive a
sensitivity measure resulting in a frequency-dependent connectivity map that
reveals connections crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of the
observed oscillations and identifies the minimal circuit generating a given
frequency. The low-gamma peak turns out to be generated in a sub-circuit
located in layer 2/3 and 4, while the high-gamma peak emerges from the
inter-neurons in layer 4. Connections within and onto layer 5 are found to
regulate slow rate fluctuations. We further demonstrate how small perturbations
of the crucial connections have significant impact on the population spectra,
while the impairment of other connections leaves the dynamics on the population
level unaltered. The study uncovers connections where mechanisms controlling
the spectra of the cortical microcircuit are most effective.

dedicated photometric surveys. The fact that some of them pulsate opens the
unparalleled chance for sounding their interiors. We present a detailed
nonadiabatic pulsational analysis of such stars based on a new set of He-core
white-dwarf models with masses ranging from $0.1554$ to $0.4352 M_{\sun}$
derived by computing the non-conservative evolution of a binary system
consisting of an initially $1 M_{\sun}$ ZAMS star and a $1.4 M_{\sun}$ neutron
star. We have computed nonadiabatic radial modes and nonradial g and p modes to
assess the dependence of the pulsational stability properties of these objects
with stellar parameters such as the stellar mass, the effective temperature,
and the convective efficiency. We found that a dense spectrum of unstable
radial modes and nonradial g and p modes are driven by the kappa-gamma
mechanism due to the partial ionization of H in the stellar envelope, in
addition to low-order unstable g modes characterized by short pulsation periods
which are significantly excited by H burning via the epsilon mechanism of mode
driving. In all the cases, the characteristic times required for the modes to
reach amplitudes large enough as to be observable (the $e$-folding times) are
always shorter than cooling timescales. We explore the dependence of the ranges
of unstable mode periods (the longest and shortest excited periods) with the
effective temperature, the stellar mass, the convective efficiency, and the
harmonic degree of the modes. We also compare our theoretical predictions with
the excited modes observed in the seven known variable low-mass white dwarfs

energy consumption of next generation networks is required to be load adaptive
as the network load varies significantly throughout the day. In this paper, we
propose a load adaptive massive MIMO system that varies the number of antennas
following the daily load profile (DLP) in order to maximize the downlink energy
efficiency (EE). A multi-cell system is considered where each base station (BS)
is equipped with a large number of antennas to serve many single antenna users.
In order to incorporate DLP, each BS is modeled as an M/G/m/m state dependent
queue under the assumption that the network is dimensioned to serve a maximum
number of users at the peak load. For a given number of users in a cell, the
optimum number of active antennas maximizing EE is derived. The EE maximization
problem is formulated in a game theoretic framework where the number of
antennas to be used by a BS is determined through best response iteration. This
load adaptive system achieves overall 19% higher EE compared to a baseline
system where the BSs always run with the fixed number of antennas that is most
energy efficient at peak load and that can be switched-off when there is no

almost six decades, despite playing a central role in the spontaneous chiral
symmetry of QCD or in the nucleon-nucleon attraction. This controversy has also
been fed by the strong indications that it is not an ordinary quark-antiquark
meson. Here we review both the recent and old experimental data and the model
independent dispersive formalisms which have provided precise determinations of
its mass and width, finally settling the controversy and leading to its new
name: $f_0(500)$. We then provide a rather conservative average of the most
recent and advanced dispersive determinations of its pole position
$\sqrt{s_\sigma}=449^{+22}_{-16}-i(275\pm12)$.
  In addition, after comprehensive introductions, we will review within the
modern perspective of effective theories and dispersion theory, its relation to
chiral symmetry, unitarization techniques, its quark mass dependence, popular
models, as well as the recent strong evidence, obtained from the QCD $1/N_c$
expansion or Regge theory, for its non ordinary nature in terms of quarks and
gluons.

prescribed threshold by a regulatory protein. The timing of such events is
stochastic as a consequence of the innate randomness in gene expression. A
question of interest is to understand how gene expression is regulated to
achieve precision in event timing. To address this, we model event timing using
the first-passage time framework - a mathe- matical tool to analyze the time
when a stochastic process first crosses a specific threshold. The protein
evolution is described via a simple stochastic model of gene expression.
Moreover, we consider the feedback regulation of protein degradation to be a
possible noise control mechanism employed to achieve the precision. Exact
analytical formulas are developed for the distribution and moments of the
first-passage time. Using these expressions, we investigate for the optimal
feedback strategy such that noise (coefficient of variation squared) in event
timing is minimized around a given fixed mean time. Our results show that the
minimum noise is achieved when the protein degradation rate is zero for all
protein levels. Lastly, the implications of this finding are discussed.

by the addition of gravitational flux. The possible configurations of this flux
for a given source may be called gravitational hair, and several recent works
discuss gravitational observables (`gravitational Wilson lines') which create
this hair in highly-collimated `combed' configurations. We construct and
analyze time-symmetric classical solutions of 2+1 Einstein-Hilbert gravity such
as might be created by smeared versions of such operators. We focus on the
AdS$_3$ case, where this hair is characterized by the profile of the boundary
stress tensor; the desired solutions are those where the boundary stress tensor
at initial time $t=0$ agrees precisely with its vacuum value outside an angular
interval $[-\alpha,\alpha]$. At linear order in source strength the energy is
independent of the combing parameter $\alpha$, but non-linearities cause the
full energy to diverge as $\alpha \to 0$. In general, solutions with combed
gravitational flux also suffer from what we call displacement from their naive
location. For weak sources and large $\alpha$ one may set the displacement to
zero by further increasing the energy, though for strong sources and small
$\alpha$ we find no preferred notion of a zero-displacement solution. In the
latter case we conclude that naively-expected gravitational Wilson lines do not
exist. In the zero-displacement case, taking the AdS scale $\ell$ to infinity
gives finite-energy flux-directed solutions that may be called asymptotically
flat.

supernova remnant (SNR) PKS 1209-51/52, and the unusual pulsar Calvera that is
possibly a CCO descendant. For 1E 1207.4-5209, an insignificant proper motion
of 15+/-7 mas/yr is measured, corresponding to a corrected tangential velocity
of <180 km/s at the distance of 2 kpc. This proves that the previously noted
large offset of the pulsar from the apparent geometric center of the SNR is not
due to high proper motion; evidently the symmetry of the remnant does not
indicate its center of expansion. Calvera has a marginally significant proper
motion of 69+/-26 mas/yr, corresponding to 86+/-33 km/s for a hypothetical
distance of 0.3 kpc. Notably, its vector is away from the Galactic plane,
although its high Galactic latitude of b = +37 deg may be more a consequence of
its proximity than its velocity. We also provide updated timing solutions for
each pulsar. Spanning 14.5 yr, the ephemeris of 1E 1207.4-5209 has a small and
steady frequency derivative that, because of the negligible proper motion,
requires no kinematic correction. The derived surface dipole magnetic field
strength of 1E 1207.4-5209 thus remains B_s = 9.8e10 G. Calvera has B_s =
4.4e11 G, intermediate between those of ordinary young pulsars and CCOs,
suggesting that it may be on a trajectory of field growth that could account
for the absence of descendants in the neighborhood of CCOs in the P-Pdot

the coupling constant between the nearest-neighbor spins of the model, which is
either performed within the same phase or across the quantum phase transition
point connecting the order-disorder phases of the model. We characterize the
time-evolved quantum correlations, entanglement and quantum discord, which
exhibit varying behavior depending on the initial state and the quenching
scheme. We show that the system is endowed with enhanced bipartite quantum
correlations compared to that of the initial state, when quenched from ordered
to the deep disordered phase. However, bipartite quantum correlations are
almost washed out when the system is quenched from disordered to the ordered
phase with the initial state being at the zero-temperature. Moreover, we
identify the condition for the occurrence of enhanced bipartite correlations
when the system is quenched within the same phase. Finally, we investigate the
bipartite quantum correlations when the initial state is a thermal equilibrium
state with finite temperature which reveals the effects of thermal fluctuation
on the phenomena observed at zero-temperature.

smooth in solid ones. Thus, the impact of the internal structure of celestial

this work is to present a local model of tidal gravito-inertial waves allowing
us to quantify analytically the internal dissipation due to viscous friction

subjective measures of frustration and satisfaction to collective measures of
fairness in wealth distribution, such as the Lorenz curve and the Gini index.
We find that a completely libertarian, law-of-the-jungle setting, where every
agent can acquire wealth from, or lose wealth to, anybody else invariably leads
to a complete polarization of the distribution of wealth vs. opportunity. The
picture is however dramatically modified when hard constraints are imposed over
agents, and they are limited to share wealth with neighbors on a network. We
then propose an out of equilibrium dynamics {\it of} the networks, based on a
competition between power and frustration in the decision-making of agents that
leads to network coevolution. We show that the ratio of power and frustration
controls different dynamical regimes separated by kinetic transitions and
characterized by drastically different values of the indices of equality. The
interplay of power and frustration leads to the emergence of three

However, it only includes three-phonon scattering due to the assumption that

directly evaluating the scattering rates of four-phonon and higher-order

developed a formalism to explicitly determine quantum mechanical scattering
probability matrices for four-phonon scattering in the full Brillouin Zone, and
by mitigating the computational challenge we have directly calculated
four-phonon scattering rates. We find that four-phonon scattering rates are
comparable to three-phonon scattering rates at medium and high temperatures,
and they increase quadratically with temperature. As a consequence, $\kappa$ of
Lennard-Jones argon is reduced by more than 60% at 80 K when four-phonon
scattering is included. Also, in less anharmonic materials -- diamond, silicon,
and germanium, $\kappa$ is still reduced considerably at high temperature by
four-phonon scattering. Also, the thermal conductivity of optical phonons is
dominated by the fourth and higher orders phonon scattering even at low
temperature.

fact, studying the shape of a trajectory means studying how the deformation

it is applied is critical: it implies that any shape variation between
individuals at the beginning of each trajectories must be completely filtered
out. A Parallel Transport, that can be based on various connection types, is
necessary to perform such kind of shape data centering. The Levi Civita
connection can also be used to transport a deformation. We demonstrate that
this procedure does not preserve deformation even in the ane case. We propose a
novel procedure called Direct Transport able to perfectly transport deformation

reheating channel, our framework yields a corresponding mass scale that allows

the distribution of the pairwise relative velocities of voids, we find a
remarkable bimodal behaviour consistent with an excess of both systematically
approaching and receding voids. We determine that the origin of this bimodality
resides in the void large scale environment, since once voids are classified
into void-in-void (R-type) or void-in-cloud (S-type), R-types are found
mutually receding away, while S-types approach each other. The magnitude of
these systematic relative velocities account for more than 100 km/s, reaching
large coherence lengths of up to 200 h$^{-1}$ Mpc . We have used samples of
voids from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) and the

detail and compare them to observational results. The simulations were
performed with the AMR code RAMSES and include the effect of AGN feedback at
the sub-grid level. AGN feedback is required to produce realistic galaxy and
cluster properties and plays a role in mixing material in the central regions
and regulating star formation in the central galaxy. In both our low and high
resolution runs with fiducial stellar yields, we find that stellar and ICM
metallicities are a factor of two lower than in observations. We find that cool
core clusters exhibit steeper metallicity gradients than non-cool core
clusters, in qualitative agreement with observations. We verify that the ICM
metallicities measured in the simulation can be explained by a simple
""regulator"" model in which the metallicity is set by a balance of stellar yield
and gas accretion. It is plausible that a combination of higher resolution and
higher metal yield in AMR simulation would allow the metallicity of simulated
clusters to match observed values; however this hypothesis needs to be tested
with future simulations. Comparison to recent literature highlights that
results concerning the metallicity of clusters and cluster galaxies might
depend sensitively on the scheme chosen to solve the hydrodynamics.

$0.44\pm0.04 M_\odot$, one of the heaviest known redback companions. It is

volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic study of the most massive ETGs
($M_* >10^{11.5}M_\odot$) within 108 Mpc. These objects were selected because
they showed signs of an interstellar medium and/or star formation. A large
amount of gas ($>$2$\times$10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$) is present in 10 out of 15
objects, and these galaxies have gas fractions higher than expected based on
extrapolation from lower mass samples. We tentatively interpret this as
evidence that stellar mass loss and hot halo cooling may be starting to play a
role in fuelling the most massive galaxies. These MASSIVE ETGs seem to have
lower star-formation efficiencies (SFE=SFR/M$_{\rm H2}$) than spiral galaxies,
but the SFEs derived are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution
found in other lower mass ETG samples. This suggests that the SFE is not simply
a function of stellar mass, but that local, internal processes are more
important for regulating star formation. Finally we used the CO line profiles
to investigate the high-mass end of the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We find
that there is a break in the slope of the TFR for ETGs at high masses
(consistent with previous studies). The strength of this break correlates with
the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, suggesting it is caused
by additional baryonic mass being present in the centre of massive ETGs. We
speculate on the root cause of this change and its implications for galaxy
formation theories.

presented. The calculation of determinants and their derivatives is performed
using the Sherman-Morrison formula for updating the inverse Slater matrix. An
improved implementation based on the reduction of the number of column
substitutions and on a very efficient implementation of the calculation of the
scalar products involved is presented. It is emphasized that multideterminant
expansions contain in general a large number of identical spin-specific
determinants: for typical configuration interaction-type wavefunctions the
number of unique spin-specific determinants $N_{\rm det}^\sigma$
($\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow$) with a non-negligible weight in the expansion is
of order ${\cal O}(\sqrt{N_{\rm det}})$. We show that a careful implementation
of the calculation of the $N_{\rm det}$-dependent contributions can make this
step negligible enough so that in practice the algorithm scales as the total
number of unique spin-specific determinants, $\; N_{\rm det}^\uparrow + N_{\rm
det}^\downarrow$, over a wide range of total number of determinants (here,
$N_{\rm det}$ up to about one million), thus greatly reducing the total
computational cost. Finally, a new truncation scheme for the multideterminant
expansion is proposed so that larger expansions can be considered without
increasing the computational time. The algorithm is illustrated with
all-electron Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the total energy
of the chlorine atom. Calculations using a trial wavefunction including about
750 000 determinants with a computational increase of $\sim$ 400 compared to a
single-determinant calculation are shown to be feasible.

Schwarzschild radius) as a deprojected distance, from the 43 GHz core in the
approaching jet. In addition, the innermost component at the counter jet side
appeared to approach the same position at infinity of the frequency, indicating
that cores on both sides are approaching the same position, suggesting a
spatial coincidence with the central engine. Applying a phase referencing
technique, we also obtained spectral index maps, which indicate that emission
from the counter jet is affected by free-free absorption (FFA). The result of
the core shift profile on the counter jet also requires FFA because the core
positions at 5-15GHz cannot be explained by a simple core shift model based on
synchrotron self-absorption (SSA). Our result is apparently consistent with the
SSA core shift with an additional disk-like absorber over the counterjet side.
Core shift and opacity profiles at the counter jet side suggest a two-component
accretion: a radiatively inefficient accretion flow at the inner region and a

the computer science community. Its applications today range far beyond the
original aim of building metasearch engines to problems in machine learning,
recommendation systems and more. Several algorithms have been proposed for
these problems, and in many cases approximation guarantees have been proven for
them. However, it is also known that some Markov chain based algorithms (MC1,
MC2, MC3, MC4) perform extremely well in practice, yet had no known performance
guarantees. We prove supra-constant lower bounds on approximation guarantees
for all of them. We also raise the lower bound for sorting by Copeland score
from 3/2 to 2 and prove an upper bound of 11, before showing that in particular
ways, MC4 can nevertheless be seen as a generalization of Copeland score.

generations of neutrinos in scenarios where the right-handed neutrinos have
explicit bare mass terms in the Lagrangian and where these are dynamically
generated through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. To best
highlight the difference of the two cases we concentrate on the absolute
stability of the scalar potential. We observe that for the first scenario, the
scale at which the scalar potential becomes unstable is lower from that within
the Standard Model. In addition the Yukawa couplings $\mathbf{Y}_\nu$ are
constrained such that $\Tr{[\mathbf{Y}^{\dagger}_\nu \mathbf{Y}_{\nu}}]
\lesssim10^{-3}$. In the second scenario the electroweak stability can be
improved in a large region of parameter space. However, we found that the
scalar used to break the lepton number symmetry cannot be too light and have a
large coupling to right-handed neutrinos in order for the seesaw mechanism to
be a valid mechanism for neutrino mass generation. In this case we have $\Tr

every gap $g=2k$ does occur in the sieve, and its asymptotic population
supports the estimates made in Hardy and Littlewood's Conjecture B. A stronger

tracers and total magnetic field is high, while the structures of the ordered
magnetic field are poorly correlated with those of other tracers. -- The
magnetic field configuration in M83 contains pronounced magnetic arms. Some of
them are displaced from the corresponding material arms, while others overlap
with the material arms. The magnetic field vectors at {\lambda}6 cm are aligned
with the outer material arms, while significant deviations occur in the inner
arms and in the bar region, possibly due to non-axisymmetric gas flows. Outside
the bar region, the typical pitch angles of the material and magnetic spiral
arms are very close to each other at about 10{\deg}. The typical pitch angle of
the magnetic field vectors is about 20{\deg} larger than that of the material
spiral arms. One of the main magnetic arms in M83 is displaced from the gaseous

action with a transient spiral pattern is a promising mechanism for producing
such complicated spiral patterns as in M83.

We demonstrate a rich application from natural language processing in which

Markov chains (CTMC) to a mean-field model. When the mean-field model is a
finite-dimensional dynamical system with a unique equilibrium point, an
analysis based on Stein's method and the perturbation theory shows that under
some mild conditions, the stationary distributions of CTMCs converge (in the
mean-square sense) to the equilibrium point of the mean-field model if the
mean-field model is globally asymptotically stable and locally exponentially
stable. In particular, the mean square difference between the $M$th CTMC in the
steady state and the equilibrium point of the mean-field system is $O(1/M),$
where $M$ is the size of the $M$th CTMC. This approach based on Stein's method
provides a new framework for studying the convergence of CTMCs to their
mean-field limit by mainly looking into the stability of the mean-field model,
which is a deterministic system and is often easier to analyze than the CTMCs.
More importantly, this approach quantifies the rate of convergence, which
reveals the approximation error of using mean-field models for approximating
finite-size systems.

Gaussian source and private information: compression, communication, and the

introduce a new member in the latter class: the photo-Nernst effect. In
graphene devices in a perpendicular magnetic field we observe photocurrent
generated uniformly along the free edges, with opposite sign at opposite edges.
The signal is antisymmetric in field, shows a peak versus gate voltage at the
neutrality point flanked by wings of opposite sign at low fields, and exhibits
quantum oscillations at higher fields. These features are all explained by the
Nernst effect associated with laser-induced electron heating. This photo-Nernst

lines in red giants in Galactic globular and open clusters, and in a sample of
red giants in the LMC disk that have significantly different [Ca/Fe] abundance
ratios to the Galactic objects. The Galactic objects are used to generate a
calibration between Ca II triplet line strength and [Fe/H], which is then used
to estimate [Fe/H]_CaT for the LMC stars. The values are then compared with the
[Fe/H]_spec determinations from high dispersion spectroscopy. After allowance
for a small systematic offset the two abundance determinations are in excellent
agreement. Further, as found in earlier studies, e.g., Battaglia et al. (2008),
the difference is only a very weak function of the [Ca/Fe] ratio. For example,
changing [Ca/Fe] from +0.3 to -0.2 causes the Ca II based abundance to
underestimate [Fe/H]_spec by only ~0.15 dex, assuming a Galactic calibration.
Consequently, the Ca II triplet approach to metallicity determinations can be
used without significant bias to study stellar systems that have substantially
different chemical evolution histories.

availability, seasonality, competition, and even the consumer's physiological
state. The isotopic composition of a consumer is a product of these factors as
well as the isotopic 'landscape' of its prey, i.e. the isotopic mixing space.
Here we build a mechanistic framework that links the ecological and
physiological processes of an individual consumer to the isotopic distribution
that describes its diet, and ultimately to the isotopic composition of its own
tissues, defined as its 'isotopic niche'. By coupling these processes, we
systematically investigate under what conditions the isotopic niche of a
consumer changes as a function of both the geometric properties of its mixing
space and foraging strategies that may be static or dynamic over time. Results
of our derivations reveal general insight into the conditions impacting
isotopic niche width as a function of consumer specialization on prey, as well
as the consumer's ability to transition between diets over time. We show
analytically that moderate specialization on isotopically unique prey can serve
to maximize a consumer's isotopic niche width, while temporally dynamic diets
will tend to result in peak isotopic variance during dietary transitions. We
demonstrate the relevance of our theoretical findings by examining a marine
system composed of nine invertebrate species commonly consumed by sea otters.
In general, our analytical framework highlights the complex interplay of mixing
space geometry and consumer dietary behavior in driving expansion and
contraction of the isotopic niche. Because this approach is established on
ecological mechanism, it is well-suited for enhancing the ecological
interpretation, and uncovering the root causes, of observed isotopic data.

way to accomplish this task formulates an observed sequence data likelihood
exploiting a coalescent model for the sampled individuals' genealogy and then
integrating over all possible genealogies via Monte Carlo or, less efficiently,
by conditioning on one genealogy estimated from the sequence data. However,
when analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, current methods
implicitly assume either that sampling times are fixed deterministically by the
data collection protocol or that their distribution does not depend on the size
of the population. Through simulation, we first show that, when sampling times
do probabilistically depend on effective population size, estimation methods
may be systematically biased. To correct for this deficiency, we propose a new
model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the
sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process dependent on effective
population size. We demonstrate that in the presence of preferential sampling
our new model not only reduces bias, but also improves estimation precision.

dynamic range from 1 photo electron (P.E.) to 4000 P.E. Prototype of an
analogue front-end Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) fabricated in
Chartered 0.35 {\mu}m CMOS technology is designed to read out PMT signal in the
WCDA. This ASIC employs leading edge discrimination and RC4 shaping structure;
combined with the following Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) and
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), both the arrival time and charge of the PMT
signal can be measured. Initial test results indicate that time resolution is
better than 350 ps and charge resolution is better than 10% at 1 P.E. and
better than 1% with large input signals (300 P.E. to 4000 P.E.). Besides, this
ASIC has a small channel-to-channel crosstalk and low ambient temperature
dependency.

novel spectrum sharing algorithms in such networks taking into account human
psychological behavior of the end-users, which often deviates from EUT.
Specifically, we consider the impact of end-user decision making on pricing and
management of radio resources in a cognitive radio enabled network when there
is uncertainty in the Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees offered by the
Service Provider (SP). Using Prospect Theory (a Nobel-Prize-winning behavioral
economic theory that captures human decision making and its deviation from
EUT), we design data pricing and channel allocation algorithms for use in
cognitive radio networks by formulating a game theoretic analysis of the
interplay between the price offerings, bandwidth allocation by the SP and the
service choices made by end-users. We show that, when the end-users
under-weight the service guarantee, they tend to reject the offer which results
in under-utilization of radio resources and revenue loss. We propose prospect
pricing, a pricing mechanism that can make the system robust to decision making
and improve radio resource management. We present analytical results as well as
preliminary human subject studies with video QoS.

storm. They range from superficial to professional, from focused to

multiple accounts within the same OSN and even more people have an account on
more than one OSN. Since all OSNs involve some amount of user input, often in

intuitive means of linking accounts is by using stylometric analysis.
  This paper reports on (what we believe to be) the first trilateral
large-scale stylometric OSN linkability study. Its outcome has important
implications for OSN privacy. The study is trilateral since it involves three
OSNs with very different missions: (1) Yelp, known primarily for its
user-contributed reviews of various venues, e.g, dining and entertainment, (2)
Twitter, popular for its pithy general-purpose micro-blogging style, and (3)

our somewhat surprising results indicate, stylometric linkability of accounts
across these heterogeneous OSNs is both viable and quite effective. The main
take-away of this work is that, despite OSN heterogeneity, it is very
challenging for one person to maintain privacy across multiple active accounts

discrete and continuum systems (i.e., systems with finite and infinite degrees
of freedom). The irreversibility is encoded into a nonlinear nonholonomic
constraint given by the expression of entropy production associated to all the
irreversible processes involved. Hence from a mathematical point of view, our
variational formalism may be regarded as a generalization of the
Lagrange-d'Alembert principle used in nonholonomic mechanics. In order to
formulate the nonholonomic constraint, we associate to each irreversible
process a variable called the thermodynamic displacement. This allows the
definition of a corresponding variational constraint. Our theory is illustrated
with various examples of discrete systems such as mechanical systems with
friction, matter transfer, electric circuits, chemical reactions, and diffusion
across membranes. For the continuum case, the variational formalism is
naturally extended to the setting of infinite dimensional nonholonomic
Lagrangian systems and is expressed in material representation, while its
spatial version is obtained via a nonholonomic Lagrangian reduction by
symmetry. In the continuum case, our theory is systematically illustrated by
the example of a multicomponent viscous heat conducting fluid with chemical

systematically investigating various deep sub-barrier fusion reactions. I
extend the standard CC model by introducing a damping factor into the coupling
matrix elements in the standard CC model. I adopt the Yukawa-plus-exponential
(YPE) model as a basic heavy ion-ion potential, which is advantageous for a
unified description of the one- and two-body potentials. For the purpose of
these systematic investigations, I approximate the one-body potential with a
third-order polynomial function based on the YPE model. Calculated fusion cross
sections for the medium-heavy mass systems of $^{64}$Ni + $^{64}$Ni, $^{58}$Ni
+ $^{58}$Ni, and $^{58}$Ni + $^{54}$Fe, the medium-light mass systems of

logarithmic derivative representations of these are also in good agreement with
the experimental data. Since the results calculated with the damping factor are
in excellent agreement with the experimental data in all systems, I conclude
that the smooth transition from the sudden to adiabatic processes occurs and
that a coordinate-dependent coupling strength is responsible for the fusion
hindrance. In all systems, the potential energies at the touching point $V_{\rm
Touch}$ strongly correlate with the incident threshold energies for which the
fusion hindrance starts to emerge, except for the medium-light mass systems.

radiation, but asymptotically it reproduces the cosmological constant.
Subjecting the theory to a number of cosmological tests confirms the soundness
of the approach and gives an optimal value for the one parameter of the model,
i.e. the bulk modulus of the space-time continuum. Finally various aspects of
the Strained State Cosmology (SSC) are discussed and contrasted with some

between two or more genes where only their co-alteration (e.g. by mutations,
amplifications or deletions) results in cell death. In recent years, SL has
emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the
SL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively
killed while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have
attempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating
SL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms.
However, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or
do not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are
therefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy.
  Results: Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions
directly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the
observation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually
exclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using
genomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast,
prostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome
Atlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and
are likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes
in these cancers. By comparing with published data on gene essentiality (~16000
genes) from ten DDR-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that our identified
genes are enriched among the top quartile of essential genes in these cell
lines, implying that our inferred genes are highly likely to be (synthetic)
lethal upon knockdown in these cell lines.

For a probe qubit coupled to a quantum system, the system exhibits a resonance
dynamics when the frequency of the probe qubit matches a transition frequency
in the system. Therefore the system can be guided to evolve to the eigenstate
with known eigenvalue by inducing resonance between the probe qubit and a
designed transition in the system. This algorithm can also be used to obtain
the energy spectrum of a physical system and can achieve even a quadratic
speedup over the phase estimation algorithm.

their structural similarity they can serve very different tasks. A prime
example for such a motif is the canonical microcircuit of six-layered
neo-cortex, which is repeated across cortical areas, and is involved in a
number of different tasks (e.g.sensory, cognitive, or motor tasks). This
observation has spawned interest in finding a common underlying principle, a
'goal function', of information processing implemented in this structure. By
definition such a goal function, if universal, cannot be cast in
processing-domain specific language (e.g. 'edge filtering', 'working memory').
Thus, to formulate such a principle, we have to use a domain-independent
framework. Information theory offers such a framework. However, while the
classical framework of information theory focuses on the relation between one
input and one output (Shannon's mutual information), we argue that neural
information processing crucially depends on the combination of
\textit{multiple} inputs to create the output of a processor. To account for
this, we use a very recent extension of Shannon Information theory, called
partial information decomposition (PID). PID allows to quantify the information
that several inputs provide individually (unique information), redundantly
(shared information) or only jointly (synergistic information) about the
output. First, we review the framework of PID. Then we apply it to reevaluate
and analyze several earlier proposals of information theoretic neural goal
functions (predictive coding, infomax, coherent infomax, efficient coding). We
find that PID allows to compare these goal functions in a common framework, and
also provides a versatile approach to design new goal functions from first
principles. Building on this, we design and analyze a novel goal function,
called 'coding with synergy'. [...]

implicitly without complicated rate splitting and routing. This partial

N-node Gaussian unicast, multicast, and broadcast relay networks, the scheme
achieves within 0.5N bits from the cutset bound and thus from the capacity

network coding, which generalized compress-forward to unicast, multicast, and

that the bulk of SLSNe-I including those with relatively narrow light curves
like SN 2010gx or broad ones like PTF09cnd can be explained by the interaction
of the SN ejecta with he CS envelope, though the range of parameters for these
models is rather wide. Moderate explosion energy ($\sim (2 - 4)\cdot 10^{51}$
ergs) is sufficient to explain both narrow and broad SLSN-I light curves, but
ejected mass and envelope mass differ for those two cases. Only 5 to 10
$M_\odot$ of non-hydrogen material is needed to reproduce the light curve of SN
2010gx, while the best model for PTF09cnd is very massive: it contains almost $
50 M_\odot $ in the CS envelope and only $ 5 M_\odot $ in the ejecta. The CS
envelope for each case extends from 10 $R_\odot$ to $\sim 10^5R_\odot$ ($7\cdot

Here, however, we are interested in the late time cosmology of the model in the
presence of matter and radiation to explain the present time accelerating
Universe. During the radiation and matter eras, the gauge field tracks
radiation and basically acts like a dark radiation sector. As we approach lower
redshifts, the dark component takes the form of a dark energy source which
eventually becomes the dominate part of the energy budget of the Universe. Due
to the tracking feature of our model, solutions with different initial values
are attracted to a common trajectory. The existence of early dark radiation is
a robust prediction of our model which contributes to the effective number of

high dimensional expansion, which we term cosystolic expansion. Applying this
criterion on Ramanujan complexes, yields for every dimension, an infinite
family of bounded degree complexes with the topological overlapping property.
This answer affirmatively an open question raised by Gromov.

individuals: Those that mi- grate between habitats, and those that remain fixed
in a single habitat. We propose several discrete-time population models to
investigate the coexistence of migrants and residents. The first class of
models is linear, and we distinguish two scenarios. In the first, there is a
single egg pool to which both populations contribute. A fraction of the eggs is
destined to become migrants, and the remainder become residents. In a second
model, there are two distinct egg pools to which the two types contribute, one
corresponding to residents and another to migrants. The asymptotic growth or
decline in these models can be phrased in terms of the value of the basic
reproduction number being larger or less than one respectively. A second class
of models incorporates density dependence effects. It is assumed that increased
densities in the various life history stages adversely affect the success of
transitioning of individuals to subsequent stages. Here too we consider models
with one or two egg pools. Although these are nonlinear models, their
asymptotic dynamics can still be classified in terms of the value of a locally
defined basic reproduction number: If it is less than one, then the entire
population goes extinct, whereas it settles at a unique fixed point consisting
of a mixture of residents and migrants, when it is larger than one. Thus, the
value of the basic reproduction number can be used to predict the stable
coexistence or collapse of populations exhibiting partial migration.

(near-)grazing planetary transits through all ground and space based transit
surveys. We performed simulations to generate the synthetic distribution of
detectable planets based on their impact parameter, and found that a larger
number of (near-)grazing planets should have been detected than have been
detected. Our explanation for the insufficient number of (near-)grazing planets
is based on a simple assumption that a large number of (near-)grazing planets
transit host stars which harbor dark giant polar spot, and thus the transit
light-curve vanishes due to the occultation of grazing planet and the polar
spot. We conclude by evaluating the properties required of polar spots in order
to make disappear the grazing transit light-curve, and we conclude that their
properties are compatible with the expected properties from observations.

given by Mordechay Levin in 1979 achieves the lowest discrepancy bound. In this
work we analyze this construction in terms of computability and computational
complexity. We show that, under basic assumptions, it yields a computable real
number. The construction does not give the digits of the fractional expansion
explicitly, but it gives a sequence of increasing approximations whose limit is
the announced absolutely normal number. The $n$-th approximation has an error
less than $2^{2^{-n}}$. To obtain the $n$-th approximation the construction
requires, in the worst case, a number of mathematical operations that is double
exponential in $n$. We consider variants on the construction that reduce the
computational complexity at the expense of an increment in discrepancy.

a dual characterization of the pre-kernel by a finite union of solution sets of
a family of quadratic and convex objective functions, we could derive some
results related to the uniqueness of the pre-kernel. Rather than extending the
knowledge of game classes for which the pre-kernel consists of a single point,
we apply a different approach. We select a game from an arbitrary game class
with a single pre-kernel element satisfying the non-empty interior condition of
a payoff equivalence class, and then establish that the set of related and
linear independent games which are derived from this pre-kernel point of the
default game replicates this point also as its sole pre-kernel element. In the
proof we apply results and techniques employed in the above work. Namely, we
prove in a first step that the linear mapping of a pre-kernel element into a
specific vector subspace of balanced excesses is a singleton. Secondly, that
there cannot exist a different and non-transversal vector subspace of balanced
excesses in which a linear transformation of a pre-kernel element can be
mapped. Furthermore, we establish that on the restricted subset on the game
space that is constituted by the convex hull of the default and the set of
related games, the pre-kernel correspondence is single-valued, and therefore
continuous. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions that preserve the
pre-nucleolus property for related games even when the default game has not a
single pre-kernel point.

  Homeostatic and Autopoietic Approach","in Spanish",,,,"cs.MA nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis presents the theoretical, conceptual and methodological aspects
that support the modeling of dynamical systems (DS) by using several agents.
The modeling approach permits the assessment of properties representing order,
change, equilibrium, adaptability, and autonomy, in DS. The modeling processes
were supported by a conceptual corpus regarding systems dynamics, multi-agent
systems, graph theory, and, particularly, the information theory. Besides to
the specification of the dynamical systems as a computational network of
agents, metrics that allow characterizing and assessing the inherent complexity
of such systems were defined. As a result, properties associated with
emergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis were
defined, formalized and measured. The validation of the underlying DS model was
carried out on discrete systems (boolean networks and cellular automata) and
ecological systems. The central contribution of this thesis was the development
of a methodological approach for DS modeling. This approach includes a larger
set of properties than in traditional studies, what allows us to deepen in
questioning essential issues associated with the DS field. All this was
achieved from a simple base of calculation and interpretation, which does not
require advanced mathematical knowledge, and facilitates their application in
different fields of science.
