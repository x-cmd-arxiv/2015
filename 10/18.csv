presents several design challenges in terms of hardware resources, speed and

of operations for computing the integral image, the required internal memory
becomes prohibitively large for an embedded integral image computation engine

with some constant speed $v_0$ through another static quasineutral plasma. A
dispersion equation is derived describing the Alfven wave coupled with the flow
driven mode $\omega= k v_0$ and solutions are discussed analytically and
numerically. The usual solutions for two oppositely propagating Alfv\'en waves
are substantially modified due to the flowing plasma. More profound is
modification of the solution propagating in the negative direction with respect
to the magnetic field and the plasma flow. For a large enough flow speed
(exceeding the Alfven speed in the static plasma), this negative solution may
become non-propagating, with frequency equal to zero. In this case it
represents a spatial variation of the electromagnetic field. For greater flow
speed it becomes a forward mode, and it may merge with the positive one. This
merging of the two modes represents the starting point for a flow-driven
instability, with two complex-conjugate solutions. The Alfven wave in
interpenetrating plasmas is thus modified and coupled with the flow-driven mode
and this coupled mode is shown to be growing when the flow speed is large
enough. The energy for the instability is macroscopic kinetic energy of the
flowing plasma. The dynamics of plasma particles caused by such a coupled wave
still remains similar to the ordinary Alfven wave. This means that well-known
stochastic heating by the Alfv\'en wave may work, and this should additionally
support the potential role of the Alfven wave in the coronal heating.

presents a metric that can be calculated rapidly, concurs with human visual

repeatability. The metric is shown to provide a measure of complementarity for
combinations of detectors, correctly reflecting the underlying principles of
individual detectors. Qualitative results on well-established datasets for

Using a hypothesis testing approach and a newly-acquired, larger image

dispersions of disk stars in a sample of nearly face-on galaxies. By setting
the disk scale-heights to be equal to those of edge-on galaxies with similar
scale-lengths, it was found that these disks must be sub-maximal, with
surprisingly low K-band mass-to-light ratios of the order of $M_\star/L_K
\simeq 0.3 M_\odot/L_\odot$. This study made use of a simple relation between
the disk surface density and the measured velocity dispersion and scale height
of the disk, neglecting the shape of the rotation curve and the dark matter
contribution to the vertical force, which can be especially important in the
case of sub-maximal disks. Here, we point out that these simplifying
assumptions led to an overestimation of the stellar mass-to-light ratios.
Relaxing these assumptions, we compute even lower values than previously
reported for the mass-to-light ratios, with a median $M_\star/L_K \simeq 0.18
M_\odot/L_\odot$, where 14 galaxies have $M_\star/L_K < 0.11$. Invoking prolate
dark matter halos made only a small difference to the derived $M_\star/L_K$,

might help. The cross-terms in the Jeans equation are also generally
negligible. These deduced K-band stellar mass-to-light ratios are even more

an internal heat source, which affects planetary structure and helps facilitate
plate tectonics. A minimum level of nuclear activity is thought to be necessary
--- but not sufficient --- for planets to be habitable. Extending previous work
that focused on short-lived nuclei, this paper considers the delivery of
long-lived radioactive nuclei to circumstellar disks in star forming regions.
Although the long-lived nuclear species are always present, their abundances
can be enhanced through multiple mechanisms. Most stars form in embedded
cluster environments, so that disks can be enriched directly by intercepting
ejecta from supernovae within the birth clusters. In addition, molecular clouds
often provide multiple episodes of star formation, so that nuclear abundances
can accumulate within the cloud; subsequent generations of stars can thus
receive elevated levels of radioactive nuclei through this distributed
enrichment scenario. This paper calculates the distribution of additional
enrichment for $^{40}$K, the most abundant of the long-lived radioactive
nuclei. We find that distributed enrichment is more effective than direct
enrichment. For the latter mechanism, ideal conditions lead to about 1 in 200
solar systems being directly enriched in $^{40}$K at the level inferred for the
early solar nebula (thereby doubling the abundance). For distributed enrichment
from adjacent clusters, about 1 in 80 solar systems are enriched at the same
level. Distributed enrichment over the entire molecular cloud is more
uncertain, but can be even more effective.

both neutron and light charged particle induced nuclear reactions with 1p-shell
light nuclei involved. The dynamic of STLN is described by the unified
Hauser-Feshbach and exciton model, of which the angular momentum and parity
conservations are considered in equilibrium and pre-equilibrium processes. The
Coulomb barriers of the incident and outgoing charged particles, which
seriously influence the open reaction channels, could be reasonably considered
in the incident channel and the different outgoing channels. In kinematics, the
recoiling effects in various emission processes are taken strictly into
account. Taking $^9$Be(p, xn) reaction as an example, we calculate the
double-differential cross sections of outgoing neutrons and charged particles
using PUNF code in the frame of STLN. The calculated results agree very well
with the existing experimental neutron double-differential cross sections at
$E_p=18$ MeV, and indicate that PUNF code is a powerful tool to set up file-6
in the reaction data library for the light charged particle induced nuclear
reactions with 1p-shell light nuclei involved.

evolution studies as it is easily detectable in all late-type stars. Such
studies require precise elemental abundances, and thus departures from LTE need
to be accounted for. Our goal is to provide reliable departure coefficients and
equivalent widths in non-LTE, and for reference in LTE, for diagnostic lines of
Mg studied in late-type stars. These can be used e.g., to correct LTE spectra
and abundances. Using the model atom built and tested in the preceding paper in
this series, we performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations in a grid of
3945 stellar 1D atmospheric models. We used a sub-grid of 86 models to explore
the propagation of errors in the recent atomic collision calculations to the
radiative transfer results. We obtained departure coefficients for all the
levels and equivalent widths (in LTE and non-LTE) for all the radiative
transitions included in the ""final"" model atom of Osorio et al.. We present and
describe our results and show some examples of applications of the data. The
errors due to uncertainties in the collisional data are investigated and
tabulated. The results for equivalent widths and departure coefficients are
made freely available. Giants tend to have negative abundance corrections while
dwarfs have positive, though small, corrections. Error analysis results show
that uncertainties related to the atomic collision data are typically of order
0.01 dex or less, although for few stellar models in specific lines
uncertainties can be as large as 0.03 dex. As these errors are less than or of
the same order as typical corrections, we expect that we can use these results
to extract Mg abundances from high quality spectra more reliably than from
classical LTE analysis.

worldwide threats for apiculture. Varroa destructor attacks the honey bee Apis
mellifera weakening its host by sucking hemolymph. However, the damage to bee
colonies is not strictly related to the parasitic action of the mite but it
derives, above all, from its action as vector increasing the trasmission of
many viral diseases such as acute paralysis (ABPV) and deformed wing viruses
(DWV), that are considered among the main causes of CCD (Colony Collapse
Disorder). In this work we discuss an SI model that describes how the presence
of the mite affects the epidemiology of these viruses on adult bees. We
characterize the system behavior, establishing that ultimately either only
healthy bees survive, or the disease becomes endemic and mites are wiped out.
Another dangerous alternative is the Varroa invasion scenario with the
extinction of healthy bees. The final possible configuration is the coexistence
equilibrium in which honey bees share their infected hive with mites. The
analysis is in line with some observed facts in natural honey bee colonies.
Namely, these diseases are endemic. Further, if the mite population is present,
necessarily the viral infection occurs. The findings of this study indicate
that a low horizontal transmission rate of the virus among honey bees in
beehives will help in protecting bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral
epidemics.

from geodesic motion due to its gravitational self-force. Because the
self-force is small, one can often approximate the motion as geodesic. However,
it is well known that self-force effects accumulate over time, making the
geodesic approximation fail on long timescales. It is less well known that this
failure at large times translates to a failure at large distances as well. At
second perturbative order, two large-distance pathologies arise: spurious
secular growth and infrared-divergent retarded integrals. Both stand in the way
of practical computations of second-order self-force effects.
  Utilizing a simple flat-space scalar toy model, I develop methods to overcome
these obstacles. The secular growth is tamed with a multiscale expansion that
captures the system's slow evolution. The divergent integrals are eliminated by
matching to the correct retarded solution at large distances. I also show how
to extract conservative self-force effects by taking local-in-time ""snapshots""
of the global solution. These methods are readily adaptable to the physically
relevant case of a point mass orbiting a black hole.

science, and there are now several methods to detect dense ""communities"" of
nodes in multilayer networks. One way to define a community is as a set of
nodes that trap a diffusion-like dynamical process (usually a random walk) for
a long time. In this view, communities are sets of nodes that create
bottlenecks to the spreading of a dynamical process on a network. We analyze
the local behavior of different random walks on multiplex networks (which are
multilayer networks in which different layers correspond to different types of
edges) and show that they have very different bottlenecks that hence correspond
to rather different notions of what it means for a set of nodes to be a good
community. This has direct implications for the behavior of community-detection
methods that are based on these random walks.

asymmetry is produced not by the decay of a heavy particle, but by the
scattering between the standard model particles. After the decay of an
inflaton, the model is described within the standard model with higher
dimensional operators. The Sakharov's three conditions are satisfied by the
following way. The violation of the lepton number is realized by the
dimension-5 operator. The complex phase comes from the dimension-6 four lepton
operator. The universe is out of equilibrium before the reheating is completed.
It is found that the successful baryogenesis is realized for the wide range of

cutoff scale. Since we only rely on the effective Lagrangian, our scenario can
be applicable to all mechanisms to generate neutrino Majorana masses.

The PHY caching exploits cache-assisted multihop gain and cache-induced
dual-layer CoMP gain, which substantially improves the throughput of wireless
adhoc networks. In particular, the PHY caching scheme contains a novel PHY
transmission mode called the cache-induced dual-layer CoMP which can support
homogeneous opportunistic CoMP in the wireless adhoc network. Compared with
traditional per-node throughput scaling results of
\Theta\left(1/\sqrt{N}\right), we can achieve O(1) per node throughput for a
cached wireless adhoc network with N nodes. Moreover, we analyze the throughput
of the PHY caching scheme for regular wireless adhoc networks and study the
impact of various system parameters on the PHY caching gain.

designed by a mathematical algorithm and its security is evaluated by the
complexity of the algorithm for cryptanalysis and ability of computers. This
kind of cipher cannot exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography,and it can be
decrypted with probability one in principle by trying all the possible keys

effect in physical layer may exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography. The
quantum stream cipher by $\alpha/\eta$ or Yuen-2000 protocol (Y-00) which
operates at Gbit/sec is a typical example of such a cipher. That is, ciphertext
of mathematical cipher with a secret key is masked by quantum noise of laser
light when an eavesdropper observes optical signals as a ciphertext of the
mathematical cipher, while the legitimate receiver does not suffer the quantum
noise effect. As a result, the inherent difference of accuracy of ciphertext
between eavesdropper and legitimate receiver arises. This is a necessary

programming. The Dependent Object Types (DOT) family of calculi has been
proposed as a new foundation for Scala and similar languages. Unfortunately, it
is not clear how DOT relates to any well-known type systems, and type soundness
has only been established for very restricted subsets. In fact, important Scala
features are known to break at least one key metatheoretic property such as
environment narrowing or subtyping transitivity, which are usually required for
a type soundness proof.
  First, and, perhaps surprisingly, we show how rich DOT calculi can still be
proved sound. The key insight is that narrowing and subtyping transitivity only
need to hold for runtime objects, but not for code that is never executed.
Alas, the dominant method of proving type soundness, Wright and Felleisen's
syntactic approach, is based on term rewriting, which does not a priori make a
distinction between runtime and type assignment time.
  Second, we demonstrate how type soundness can be proved for advanced,
polymorphic, type systems with respect to high-level, definitional
interpreters, implemented in Coq. We present the first mechanized soundness
proof in this style for System F<: and several extensions, including mutable
references. Our proofs use only simple induction: another surprising result, as
the combination of big-step semantics, mutable references, and polymorphism is
commonly believed to require co-inductive proof techniques.
  Third, we show how DOT-like calculi emerge as generalizations of F<:,
exposing a rich design space of calculi with path-dependent types which we
collectively call System D. Armed with insights from the definitional
interpreter semantics, we also show how equivalent small-step semantics and
soundness proofs in Wright-Felleisen-style can be derived for these systems.

population, treating individual opinions as independent. In the real world,
individuals' opinions are often correlated, e.g., among friends in a social
network. In this paper, we explore the idea of partitioned sampling, which
partitions individuals with high opinion similarities into groups and then
samples every group separately to obtain an accurate estimate of the population
opinion. We rigorously formulate the above idea as an optimization problem. We
then show that the simple partitions which contain only one sample in each
group are always better, and reduce finding the optimal simple partition to a
well-studied Min-r-Partition problem. We adapt an approximation algorithm and a
heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Moreover, to obtain
opinion similarity efficiently, we adapt a well-known opinion evolution model
to characterize social interactions, and provide an exact computation of
opinion similarities based on the model. We use both synthetic and real-world
datasets to demonstrate that the partitioned sampling method results in
significant improvement in sampling quality and it is robust when some opinion
similarities are inaccurate or even missing.

issue in the search for alternatives to nuclear and fossil energy sources. A
theoretical analysis via numerical simulations involves solving Maxwell's
Equations in discretized form and typically requires substantial computing
effort. We start from a hybrid-parallel (MPI+OpenMP) production code that
implements the Time Harmonic Inverse Iteration Method (THIIM) with
Finite-Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD) discretization. Although this
algorithm has the characteristics of a strongly bandwidth-bound stencil update
scheme, it is significantly different from the popular stencil types that have
been exhaustively studied in the high performance computing literature to date.
We apply a recently developed stencil optimization technique, multicore
wavefront diamond tiling with multi-dimensional cache block sharing, and
describe in detail the peculiarities that need to be considered due to the
special stencil structure. Concurrency in updating the components of the
electric and magnetic fields provides an additional level of parallelism. The
dependence of the cache size requirement of the optimized code on the blocking
parameters is modeled accurately, and an auto-tuner searches for optimal
configurations in the remaining parameter space. We were able to completely
decouple the execution from the memory bandwidth bottleneck, accelerating the
implementation by a factor of three to four compared to an optimal
implementation with pure spatial blocking on an 18-core Intel Haswell CPU.

\pi^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau$, $\rho^+ (\pi^+\pi^0) \bar{\nu}_\tau$, $a^+_1
(\pi^+\pi^0\pi^0) \bar{\nu}_\tau$, are used to study the performance of the
barrel part of the silicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter (Si-W ECAL) of
the International Large Detector (ILD) at the future $e^+-e^-$ International
Linear Collider. A correct reconstruction of the tau decay mode is crucial for
constraining the tau spin state and measuring the Higgs boson CP state in $H\to
\tau^+\tau^-$ decays. About 95% of $\pi^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau$ and 90% of
$\rho^+\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $a^+_1\bar{\nu}_\tau$ decays from $e^+e^-\to Z^0\to
\tau^+\tau^-$ reaction at $e^\pm$-beam energy of 125 GeV are correctly
reconstructed. In a smaller ILD detector, with Si-W ECAL radius reduced by
about 20% these numbers degrade by at most 2%. The $\pi^0$ mass resolution
stays below 10%. Since the failures in the tau-lepton reconstruction are mainly
due to photons, the increase of the ILD magnetic field from 3.5 T to 4 T does
not bring any significant improvement.

fair cake-cutting --- dividing a heterogeneous resource among agents with
different preferences. Resource- and population-monotonicity relate to
scenarios where the cake, or the number of participants who divide the cake,
changes. It is required that the utility of all participants change in the same
direction: either all of them are better-off (if there is more to share or
fewer to share among) or all are worse-off (if there is less to share or more
to share among).
  We formally introduce these concepts to the cake-cutting problem and examine
whether they are satisfied by various common division rules. We prove that the
Nash-optimal rule, which maximizes the product of utilities, is
resource-monotonic and population-monotonic, in addition to being
Pareto-optimal, envy-free and satisfying a strong competitive-equilibrium
condition. Moreover, we prove that it is the only rule among a natural family
of welfare-maximizing rules that is both proportional and resource-monotonic.

relies on a set of rosebushes flowering data, and Gaussian mixture models are
mainly used to quantify the reblooming properties of each one. In this regard,
we also suggest our own selection criterion to take into account the lack of
symmetry of most of the flowering curves. Three classes are created on the
basis of a principal component analysis conducted on a set of reblooming
indicators, and a subclassification is made using a longitudinal $k$--means
algorithm which also highlights the role played by the precocity of the
flowering. In this way, we obtain an overview of the correlations between the
features we decided to retain on each curve. In particular, results suggest the
lack of correlation between reblooming and flowering precocity. The pertinent
indicators obtained in this study will be a first step towards the
comprehension of the environmental and genetic control of these biological

topic models from text data. NMF is widely accepted for producing good results
despite its relative simplicity of implementation and ease of computation. One
challenge with applying NMF to large datasets is that intermediate matrix
products often become dense, stressing the memory and compute elements of a
system. In this article, we investigate a simple but powerful modification of a
common NMF algorithm that enforces the generation of sparse intermediate and
output matrices. This method enables the application of NMF to large datasets
through improved memory and compute performance. Further, we demonstrate
empirically that this method of enforcing sparsity in the NMF either preserves
or improves both the accuracy of the resulting topic model and the convergence
rate of the underlying algorithm.

inferences in function spaces, in which the unknowns are of infinite dimension.
In such problems, choosing an appropriate prior distribution is an important
task. In particular we consider problems where the function to infer is subject
to sharp jumps which render the commonly used Gaussian measures unsuitable. On
the other hand, the so-called total variation (TV) prior can only be defined in
a finite dimensional setting, and does not lead to a well-defined posterior
measure in function spaces. In this work we present a TV-Gaussian (TG) prior to
address such problems, where the TV term is used to detect sharp jumps of the
function, and the Gaussian distribution is used as a reference measure so that
it results in a well-defined posterior measure in the function space. We also
present an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to draw samples
from the posterior distribution of the TG prior. With numerical examples we
demonstrate the performance of the TG prior and the efficiency of the proposed
MCMC algorithm.

the mirror symmetry, the Ooguri-Vafa invariants are extracted from the A-model

fluid models of Korteweg type has been studied by many authors in recent years.
However, little is known of global large solutions to the nonisothermal
compressible fluid models of Korteweg type up to now. This paper is devoted to
this problem, and we are concerned with the global existence of smooth and
non-vacuum solutions with large initial data to the Cauchy problem of the
one-dimensional nonisothermal compressible fluid models of Korteweg type. The
case when the viscosity coefficient $\mu(\rho)=\rho^\alpha$, the capillarity
coefficient $\kappa(\rho)=\rho^\beta$, and the heat-conductivity coefficient
$\tilde{\alpha}(\theta)=\theta^\lambda$ for some parameters
$\alpha,\beta,\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ is considered. Under some assumptions on
$\alpha,\beta$ and $\lambda$, we prove the global existence and time-asymptotic
behavior of large solutions around constant states. The proofs are given by the
elementary energy method combined with the technique developed by Y. Kanel'
\cite{Y. Kanel} and the maximum principle.

investigate how robust the model is under natural experimental imperfections,

complexity of BosonSampling under photon losses---more specifically, the case

finite dimensional parameter of interest is expected to be asymptotically
equivalent to the sampling distribution of frequentist's efficient estimators.
This is the assertion of the so-called Bernstein-von Mises theorem, and
recently, it has been proved in many interesting semiparametric models. In this
thesis, we consider the semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem in some
models which have symmetric errors. The simplest example of these models is the
symmetric location model that has 1-dimensional location parameter and unknown
symmetric error. Also, the linear regression and random effects models are
included provided the error distribution is symmetric. The condition required
for nonparametric priors on the error distribution is very mild, and the most
well-known Dirichlet process mixture of normals works well. As a consequence,
Bayes estimators in these models satisfy frequentist criteria of optimality
such as Hajek-Le Cam convolution theorem. The proof of the main result requires
that the expected log likelihood ratio has a certain quadratic expansion, which
is a special property of symmetric densities. One of the main contribution of
this thesis is to provide an efficient estimator of regression coefficients in
the random effects model, in which it is unknown to estimate the coefficients
efficiently because the full likelihood inference is difficult. Our theorems
imply that the posterior mean or median is efficient, and the result from
numerical studies also shows the superiority of Bayes estimators. For practical
use of our main results, efficient Gibbs sampler algorithms based on
symmetrized Dirichlet process mixtures are provided.

innermost ~10 pc of our Galaxy. The most relevant structure of molecular gas is
the circumnuclear ring (CNR), a dense and clumpy ring surrounding the
supermassive black hole (SMBH), with a radius of ~2 pc. We propose that the CNR
formed through the tidal disruption of a molecular cloud, and we investigate
this scenario by means of N-body smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations.
We ran a grid of simulations with different cloud mass (4X10^4, 1.3X10^5 solar
masses), different initial orbital velocity (v_in=0.2-0.5 v_esc, where v_esc is
the escape velocity from the SMBH), and different impact parameter (b=8, 26
pc). The disruption of the molecular cloud leads to the formation of very dense
and clumpy gas rings, containing most of the initial cloud mass. If the initial
orbital velocity of the cloud is sufficiently low (v_in<0.4 v_esc, for b=26 pc)
or the impact parameter is sufficiently small (b<10 pc, for v_in>0.5 v_esc), at
least two rings form around the SMBH: an inner ring (with radius ~0.4 pc) and
an outer ring (with radius ~2-4 pc). The inner ring forms from low-angular
momentum material that engulfs the SMBH during the first periapsis passage,
while the outer ring forms later, during the subsequent periapsis passages of
the disrupted cloud. The inner and outer rings are misaligned by ~24 degrees,
because they form from different gas streamers, which are affected by the SMBH
gravitational focusing in different ways. The outer ring matches several
properties (mass, rotation velocity, temperature, clumpiness) of the CNR in our
Galactic centre. We speculate that the inner ring might account for the neutral
gas observed in the central cavity.

  User Preferences",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The matrix factorization (MF) technique has been widely adopted for solving
the rating prediction problem in recommender systems. The MF technique utilizes
the latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors)
and item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data.
However, in the real world user preferences are not static but full of
dynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time
varying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that
none of them is specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual
user preferences. Motivated by this, we develop a Temporal Matrix Factorization
approach (TMF) for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent
vector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: (i) we develop a
modified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent
vector at each time step, and (ii) by the Lasso regression we learn a linear
model for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our
method on a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. In comparison with the
original MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to
achieve lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for both the synthetic and real
datasets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is
mostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent
vectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic dataset and
the Ciao dataset, there are quite a few users with that property and the
performance gains for these two datasets are roughly 20% and 5%, respectively.

peaks in the continuum position of W51 North, and has a small tail extending to

of the Acetone (CH$_3$COCH$_3$) and Methyl Formate (CH$_3$OCHO), which may
suggest that these molecules are present in an early evolutionary stage of the

no obvious difference in the molecular gas distributions between the
oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing molecules. Under the assumption of Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), with the XCLASS tool, the molecular column
densities, and rotation temperatures are estimated.
  We found that the oxygen-bearing molecules have considerable higher column

rotation temperatures range from 100 to 200 K, suggesting that the molecular
emission could be originated from a warm environment.
  Finally, based on the gas distributions, fractional abundances and the

the attribution of changes in event frequency to climate change, and estimating
the cost associated with them. The schemes determine the fraction of events
that should be attributed to climatic change, and the fraction that should be
attributed to natural chance. They both allow for the expected increase in
claims and the fluctuations about this expected value. Importantly, the
attribution fraction proposed in the second of these schemes is necessarily
different to that found in epidemiological studies. This ensures that the
statistically expected fraction of attributed claims is correctly equal to the
expected increase in claims. The analysis of lightning data highlights two
particular difficulties with data-driven, as opposed to modeled, attribution
studies. The first is the possibility of unknown ""confounding"" variables that
can influence the strike frequency. This is partly accounted for here by
considering the influence of temperature changes within a given month, so as to
standardise the data to allow for cyclical climatic influences. The second is
the possibility suggested by the data presented here, that climate change may
lead to qualitatively different climate patterns, with a different relationship
between e.g. strike frequency and temperature.

deterministically. A time-reversal procedure, involving the invertion of the

the Loschmidt echo (LE). If somewhat imperfect, only a fraction of the
excitation will refocus. We use such a procedure to show how non-inverted weak
disorder and interactions, when assisted by the natural reversible dynamics,
fully degrade the LE. These perturbations enhance diffusion and evenly
distribute the excitation throughout the system. Such a dynamical paradigm,
called ergodicity, breaks down when either the disorder or the interactions are
too strong. These extreme regimes give rise to the well known Anderson
localization and Mott insulating phases, where quantum diffusion becomes
restricted. Accordingly, regardless of the kinetic energy terms, the excitation
remains mainly localized and out-of-equilibrium, and the system behaves
non-ergodically. The LE constitutes a fair dynamical witness for the whole
phase diagram since it evidences a surprising topography in which ergodic and
non-ergodic phases interpenetrate each other. Furthermore, we provide an
estimation for the critical lines separating the ergodic and non-ergodic phases
around the Mott and Anderson transitions. The energy uncertainties introduced
by disorder and interaction shift these thresholds towards stronger
perturbations. Remarkably, the estimations of the critical lines are in good
agreement with the phase diagram derived from the LE dynamics.

possible for an irrational power of an irrational number to be a rational

contradiction in logic for discrete mathematics textbooks and college courses.
Since the 80s, a constructive proof circulated orally, such as
$\sqrt{2}^{log_\sqrt{2} 3}$ equals to 3. A written proof was published in 2008
by Lord. The first contribution of this paper is to prove that there is an
uncountable number of such pairs of irrational numbers such that the power of
one to the other is a rational number. Marshall and Tan answered the question
of whether there is a single irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational.
They proved that given $I$ = $(\frac{1}{e})^{(\frac{1}{e},\infty)}$, then every
rational number in $I$ is either of the form $a^a$ for an irrational $a$ or is

$ln((ln(y))<x$ for $y>e$ and $x<ln(y)$, for $y> e^e$. Hence, the second

last bounce, which represents the Big Bang gives the dynamics that solves the
horizon, flatness, and homogeneity problems in cosmology. For a particular
range of the particle production coefficient, we obtain a nearly constant
Hubble parameter that gives an exponential expansion of the universe with more
than 60 $e$-folds, which lasts about $\sim 10^{-42}$ s. This scenario can thus
explain cosmic inflation without requiring a fundamental scalar field and
reheating. From the obtained time dependence of the scale factor, we follow the
prescription of Ellis and Madsen to reconstruct in a non-parametric way a
scalar field potential which gives the same dynamics of the early universe.
This potential gives the slow-roll parameters of cosmic inflation, from which
we calculate the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the scalar spectral index of density
perturbations, and its running as functions of the production coefficient. We
find that these quantities do not significantly depend on the scale factor at
the Big Bounce. Our predictions for these quantities are consistent with the

intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations. Arguably, one of the most important of
such coordinated responses is the one of amplification cascades, in which
activation of a few key-responsive transcription factors (termed master
regulators, MRs) lead to a large series of transcriptional activation events.
This is so since master regulators are transcription factors controlling the
expression of other transcription factor molecules and so on. MRs hold a
central position related to transcriptional dynamics and control of gene
regulatory networks and are often involved in complex feedback and feedforward
loops inducing non-trivial dynamics. Recent studies have pointed out to the
myocyte enhancing factor 2C (MEF2C, also known as MADS box transcription
enhancer factor 2, polypeptide C) as being one of such master regulators
involved in the pathogenesis of primary breast cancer. In this work, we perform
an integrative genomic analysis of the transcriptional regulation activity of
MEF2C and its target genes to evaluate to what extent are these molecules
inducing collective responses leading to gene expression deregulation and
carcinogenesis. We also analyzed a number of induced dynamic responses, in
particular those associated with transcriptional bursts, and nonlinear

contact forces between the grains. Here, we report an original study concerning
the discharge of a two-dimensional silo filled with repelling magnetic grains.
This non-contact interaction leads to a different dynamics from the one
observed with conventional granular materials. We found that, although the flow
rate dependence on the aperture size follows roughly the power-law with an
exponent $3/2$ found in non-repulsive systems, the density and velocity
profiles during the discharge are totally different. New phenomena must be
taken into account. Despite the absence of contacts, clogging and intermittence
were also observed for apertures smaller than a critical size determined by the
effective radius of the repulsive grains.

symbols (i.e. the letters T, I, F, or their refined indexed letters Tj, Ik, Fl)
in neutrosophics. We extend the dialectical triad thesis-antithesis-synthesis
to the neutrosophic tetrad thesis-antithesis-neutrothesis-neutrosynthesis. The
we introduce the neutrosophic system that is a quasi or (t,i,f) classical
system, in the sense that the neutrosophic system deals with quasi-terms
(concepts, attributes, etc.). Then the notions of Neutrosophic Axiom,
Neutrosophic Deducibility, Degree of Contradiction (Dissimilarity) of Two
Neutrosophic Axioms, etc. Afterwards a new type of structures, called (t, i, f)
Neutrosophic Structures, and we show particular cases of such structures in
geometry and in algebra. Also, a short history of the neutrosophic set,
neutrosophic numerical components and neutrosophic literal components,
neutrosophic numbers, etc. We construct examples of splitting the literal
indeterminacy (I) into literal subindeterminacies (I1, I2, and so on, Ir), and
to define a multiplication law of these literal subindeterminacies in order to
be able to build refined I neutrosophic algebraic structures. We define three
neutrosophic actions and their properties. We then introduce the prevalence
order on T,I,F with respect to a given neutrosophic operator. And the
refinement of neutrosophic entities A, neutA, and antiA. Then we extend the
classical logical operators to neutrosophic literal (symbolic) logical
operators and to refined literal (symbolic) logical operators, and we define
the refinement neutrosophic literal (symbolic) space. We introduce the
neutrosophic quadruple numbers (a+bT+cI+dF) and the refined neutrosophic
quadruple numbers. Then we define an absorbance law, based on a prevalence
order, in order to multiply the neutrosophic quadruple numbers.

under load growth. This scenario mimics the ever-increasing customer demand and
the foreseen introduction of energy hubs interconnecting the different energy
vectors. We extend an analytical model of cascading behavior due to line
overloads to the case of interdependent networks and find evidence of first
order transitions due to the long-range nature of the flows. Our results
indicate that the foreseen increase in the couplings between the grids has two
competing effects: on the one hand, it increases the safety region where grids
can operate without withstanding systemic failures; on the other hand, it
increases the possibility of a joint systems' failure.

distinguishable boxes, and considering the dense system in which P much greater
than L, our natural intuition tells us that the box with the average number of
balls has the highest probability and that none of boxes are empty; however in
reality, the probability of the empty box is always the highest. This fact is
with contradistinction to sparse system in which the number of balls is smaller
than the number of boxes (i.e. energy distribution in gas) in which the average
value has the highest probability. Here we show that when we postulate the
requirement that all possible configurations of balls in the boxes have equal
probabilities, a realistic ""long tail"" distribution is obtained. This formalism
when applied for sparse systems converges to distributions in which the average
is preferred. We calculate some of the distributions resulted from this
postulate and obtain most of the known distributions in nature, namely, Zipf
law, Benford law, particles energy distributions, and more. Further
generalization of this novel approach yields not only much better predictions
for election polls, market share distribution among competing companies and so
forth, but also a compelling probabilistic explanation for Planck's famous
empirical finding that the energy of a photon is hv.
