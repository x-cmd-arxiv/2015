species has long remained unsolved by the modern evolutionary theory (MET).
However, it has not deterred researchers from producing interpretations of
genetic diversity by using MET. We here examine the two key experimental
observations of genetic diversity made in the 1960s, one between species and
the other within a population of a species, that directly contributed to the
development of MET. The interpretations of these observations as well as the
assumptions by MET are widely known to be inadequate. We review the recent
progress of an alternative framework, the maximum genetic diversity (MGD)
hypothesis, that uses axioms and natural selection to explain the vast majority
of genetic diversity as being at optimum equilibrium that is largely determined
by organismal complexity. The MGD hypothesis fully absorbs the proven virtues
of MET and considers its assumptions relevant only to a much more limited
scope. This new synthesis has accounted for the much overlooked phenomenon of
progression towards higher complexity, and more importantly, been instrumental
in directing productive research into both evolutionary and biomedical
problems.

approach for the i-vector model, and has delivered state-of-the-art performance
in speaker recognition. A potential problem of the PLDA model, however, is that
it essentially assumes Gaussian distributions over speaker vectors, which is
not always true in practice. Additionally, the objective function is not
directly related to the goal of the task, e.g., discriminating true speakers
and imposters. In this paper, we propose a max-margin metric learning approach
to solve the problems. It learns a linear transform with a criterion that the
margin between target and imposter trials are maximized. Experiments conducted
on the SRE08 core test show that compared to PLDA, the new approach can obtain
comparable or even better performance, though the scoring is simply a cosine
computation.

function is called the inversion complexity of the function. In 1957, A. A.
Markov determined the inversion complexity of every Boolean function and proved
that $\lceil\log_{2}(d(f)+1)\rceil$ NOT gates are necessary and sufficient to
compute any Boolean function $f$ (where $d(f)$ is the maximum number of value
changes from greater to smaller over all increasing chains of tuples of
variables values). This result is extended to $k$-valued functions computing in
this paper. Thereupon one can use monotone functions ""for free"" like in the
Boolean case. It is shown that the minimum sufficient number of non-monotone
gates for the realization of the arbitrary $k$-valued logic function $f$ is
equal to $\lceil\log_{2}(d(f)+1)\rceil$ if Post negation (function $x+1
\pmod{k}$) is used in NOT nodes and is also equal to
$\lceil\log_{k}(d(f)+1)\rceil$, if {\L}ukasiewicz negation (function $k-1-x$)
is used in NOT nodes. Similar extension for another classical result of A. A.
Markov for the inversion complexity of a system of Boolean functions to
$k$-valued logic functions has been obtained.

bulge has been interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure. Recently, an
alternative explanation has been suggested, where the double red clump is an
effect of multiple stellar populations in a classical spheroid. In this letter
we provide an observational assessment of this scenario and show that it is not
consistent with the behaviour of the red clump across different lines of sight,
particularly at high distances from the Galactic plane. Instead, we confirm
that the shape of the red clump magnitude distribution closely follows the
distance distribution expected for an X-shaped bulge at critical Galactic
latitudes. We also emphasize some key observational properties of the bulge red
clump that should not be neglected in the search for alternative scenarios.

detection of a target using an incident probe, with only a low probability of
interaction of the probe and the target. This 'quantum weirdness' could be
applied in the field of electron microscopy to generate images of
beam-sensitive specimens with substantially reduced damage to the specimen. A
reduction of beam-induced damage to specimens is especially of great importance
if it can enable imaging of biological specimens with atomic resolution.
Following a recent suggestion that interaction-free measurements are possible
with electrons, we now analyze the difficulties of actually building an atomic
resolution interaction-free electron microscope, or ""quantum electron
microscope"". A quantum electron microscope would require a number of unique
components not found in conventional transmission electron microscopes. These
components include a coherent electron-beam splitter or two-state-coupler, and
a resonator structure to allow each electron to interrogate the specimen
multiple times, thus supporting high success probabilities for interaction-free
detection of the specimen. Different system designs are presented here, which
are based on four different choices of two-state-couplers: a thin crystal, a
grating mirror, a standing light wave and an electro-dynamical pseudopotential.
Challenges for the detailed electron optical design are identified as future
directions for development. While it is concluded that it should be possible to
build an atomic resolution quantum electron microscope, we have also identified
a number of hurdles to the development of such a microscope and further
theoretical investigations that will be required to enable a complete
interpretation of the images produced by such a microscope.

is expected to be stable in order to confirm previous results obtained with two
dimensional simulations, and the regime in which the shock cone is expected to
show a flip-flop type of instability. The methods used to attempt triggering
the instability were first the accumulation of numerical errors and second the
explicit application of a perturbation on the velocity field after the
shock-cone was formed. The result is negative, that is, we did not find the
flip-flop instability within the parameter space we explored, which includes
cases that are expected to be unstable.

$q_T$ up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We consistently
combine resummation with the known next-to-leading order perturbative result at
intermediate and large values of $q_T$ . We include all perturbative terms up
to order $\alpha_S^2$ in our computation which, after integration over $q_T$ ,
reproduces the known next-to-next-to-leading order result for the diphoton pair
production total cross section. A comparison with LHC data is presented. We
estimate the perturbative accuracy of the theoretical calculation by performing
the corresponding variation of scales. We anticipate that the effect of the
transverse momentum resummation is not only to recover the predictivity of the
calculation at small $q_T$ , but also to improve substantially the agreement
with the experimental data.

optical data confirms the presence of two subclusters, 0.75 Mpc apart, tracing
the SSW-NNE direction and dominated by the two brightest cluster galaxies (BCG1
and BCG2). The X-ray surface brightness is strongly elongated towards the NNE
direction, and its peak is clearly offset from both the BCGs. We confirm the
presence of a 1.3 Mpc large radio halo, elongated in the ESE-WNW direction and
perpendicular to the optical/X-ray elongation. We detect a significant
radio/X-ray offset and radio polarization, two features which might be the
result of a magnetic field energy spread on large spatial scales. A523 is found
consistent with most scaling relations followed by clusters hosting radio
haloes, but quite peculiar in the Pradio-LX relation: it is underluminous in
the X-rays or overluminous in radio. A523 can be described as a binary head--on
merger caught after a collision along the SSW-NNE direction. However, minor
optical and radio features suggest a more complex cluster structure, with A523
forming at the crossing of two filaments along the SSW-NNE and ESE-WNW

time-resolved physical quantities from a general nanoelectronic quantum system

Green's function formalism, the approach is based on the scattering wave
functions of the system. It amounts to solving a set of generalized

The algorithm execution time scales linearly with both system size and
simulation time allowing one to simulate large systems (currently around $10^6$
degrees of freedom) and/or large times (currently around $10^5$ times the
smallest time scale of the system). As an application we calculate the
current-voltage characteristics of a Josephson junction for both short and long
junctions, and recover the multiple Andreev reflexion (MAR) physics. We also
discuss two intrinsically time-dependent situations: the relaxation time of a
Josephson junction after a quench of the voltage bias, and the propagation of
voltage pulses through a Josephson junction. In the case of a ballistic, long
Josephson junction, we predict that a fast voltage pulse creates an oscillatory
current whose frequency is controlled by the Thouless energy of the normal
part. A similar effect is found for short junctions, a voltage pulse produces
an oscillating current which, in the absence of electromagnetic environment,

explode by Coulomb repulsion, the emission of the energetic ions is nearly
isotropic. In the framework of cluster Coulomb explosions, we analyze the
energy distributions of the ions using a Maxwell- Boltzmann (MB) distribution,
a shifted MB distribution (sMB) and the energy distribution derived from a
log-normal (LN) size distribution of clusters. We show that the first two
distributions reproduce well the experimentally measured ion energy
distributions and the number of fusions from d-d and d-3He reactions. The LN
distribution is a good representation of the ion kinetic energy distribution
well up to high momenta where the noise becomes dominant, but overestimates
both the neutron and the proton yields. If the parameters of the LN
distributions are chosen to reproduce the fusion yields correctly, the
experimentally measured high energy ion spectrum is not well represented. We
conclude that the ion kinetic energy distribution is highly chaotic and
practically not distinguishable from a thermalized one.

light-curves, have long been studied using one-dimensional models of plasma
dynamics inside a static flare loop, subjected to some energy input. While
extremely successful at explaining the observed characteristics of flares, all
such models so far have specified energy input ad hoc, rather than deriving it
self-consistently. There is broad consensus that flares are powered by magnetic
energy released through reconnection. Recent work has generalized Petschek's
basic reconnection scenario, topological change followed by field line
retraction and shock heating, to permit its inclusion into a one-dimensional
flare loop model. Here we compare the gas dynamics driven by retraction and
shocking to those from more conventional static loop models energized by ad hoc
source terms. We find significant differences during the first minute, when
retraction leads to larger kinetic energies and produces higher densities at
the loop top, while ad hoc heating tends to rarify the loop top. The loop-top
density concentration is related to the slow magnetosonic shock, characteristic
of Petschek's model, but persists beyond the retraction phase occurring in the
outflow jet. This offers an explanation for observed loop-top sources of X-ray
and EUV emission, with advantages over that provided by ad hoc heating
scenarios. The cooling phases of the two models are, however, notably similar
to one another, suggesting observations at that stage will yield little
information on the nature of energy input.

HIT elements, taking into account the peculiarities of the open-circuit voltage
generation, in particular, its rather high values. We test our theoretical
predictions against the experimental results. For this, we fabricate HIT
elements with the efficiency of about $20\,\%$. We measured the temperature
dependence of the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, photoconversion
power, and fill factor of the current-voltage curve of these elements in a wide
temperature range from 80 to 420\,K. In the low-temperature range, the
open-circuit voltage and the photoconversion power decrease on cooling. At $T

rather well. The behavior of the fill factor and output power at low
temperatures is explained by the increase of the series resistance on cooling.
We discuss the reasons behind the reduction of the power temperature

recently-discovered functions include virulence factors and signalling
molecules as well as their better known roles as antibiotics. To date, close to
five hundred bacteriocins have been identified and classified. Recent
discoveries have shown that bacteriocins are highly diverse and widely
distributed among bacterial species. Given the heterogeneity of bacteriocin
compounds, many tools struggle with identifying novel bacteriocins due to their
vast sequence and structural diversity. Many bacteriocins undergo
post-translational processing or modifications necessary for the biosynthesis
of the final mature form. Enzymatic modification of bacteriocins as well as
their export is achieved by proteins whose genes are often located in a
discrete gene cluster proximal to the bacteriocin precursor gene, referred to
as \textit{context genes} in this study. Although bacteriocins themselves are
structurally diverse, context genes have been shown to be largely conserved
across unrelated species. Using this knowledge, we set out to identify new
candidates for context genes which may clarify how bacteriocins are
synthesized, and identify new candidates for bacteriocins that bear no sequence
similarity to known toxins. To achieve these goals, we have developed a
software tool, Bacteriocin Operon and gene block Associator (BOA) that can
identify homologous bacteriocin associated gene clusters and predict novel
ones. We discover that several phyla have a strong preference for bactericon
genes, suggesting distinct functions for this group of molecules. Availability:

protoplanetary disks. This is the so-called type I migration. Simulations
attempting to reproduce the observed properties of exoplanets show that type I
migration needs to be significantly reduced over a wide region of the disk for
a long time. However, the mechanism capable of suppressing type I migration
over a wide region has remained elusive. The recently found turbulence-driven
disk winds offer new possibilities. We investigate the effects of disk winds on
the disk profile and type I migration for a range of parameters that describe
the strength of disk winds. We also examine the in situ formation of close-in
super-Earths in disks that evolve through disk winds. The disk profile, which
is regulated by viscous diffusion and disk winds, was derived by solving the
diffusion equation. We carried out a number of simulations and plot here
migration maps that indicate the type I migration rate. We also performed
N-body simulations of the formation of close-in super-Earths from a population
of planetesimals and planetary embryos. We define a key parameter, Kw, which
determines the ratio of strengths between the viscous diffusion and disk winds.
For a wide range of Kw, the type I migration rate is presented in migration
maps. These maps show that type I migration is suppressed over the whole
close-in region when the effects of disk winds are relatively strong (Kw <
100). From the results of N-body simulations, we see that type I migration is
significantly slowed down assuming Kw = 40. We also show that the results of
N-body simulations match statistical orbital distributions of close-in

systems that break this cross-conjugation rule of thumb. We predict and
rationalize how a class of conjugated molecules containing closed loops can

constructive interference despite being cross-conjugated. The arguments build
on the graphical rules derived by Markussen et al. [1] and the hitherto
neglected effects of closed loops in the molecular structure. Finally, we

  Recombination Rate Estimation","32 pages, 13 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-locus sampling probabilities have played a central role in devising an
efficient composite likelihood method for estimating fine-scale recombination
rates. Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these sampling
probabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of a
constant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resulting
recombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases of
historical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop here
new methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size
functions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implemented
in a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the sampling
probability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large but
sparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes ($n \leq 50$) and
demographic size histories with a large number of epochs ($\mathcal{D} \geq
64$). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the sampling
probability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size
($n \geq 256$). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posterior
distribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimal
proposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we study
how a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects the
correlation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensive
simulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes under
such a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scale
recombination rate estimation. LDpop is freely available for download at

the Cold Dark Matter model ({\Lambda}CDM). Using 21 high resolution
cosmological simulations we analyse the kinematics of planes of satellites
similar to the one around Andromeda. We find good agreement when co-rotation is
characterized by the line-of-sight velocity. At the same time, when co-rotation
is inferred by the angular momenta of the satellites, the planes are in
agreement with the plane around our Galaxy. We find such planes to be common in
our high concentration haloes. The number of co-rotating satellites obtained
from the sign of the line-of-sight velocity shows large variations depending on
the viewing angle and is consistent with that obtained from a sample with
random velocities. We find that the clustering of angular momentum vectors of
the satellites in the plane is a better measure of the kinematic coherence.
Thus we conclude that the line-of- sight velocity is not well suited as a proxy
for the kinematical coherence of the plane. Analysis of the kinematics of our
planes shows a fraction of $\sim$30% chance aligned satellites. Tracking the
satellites in the plane back in time reveals that these planes are a transient
feature and not kinematically coherent as would appear at first sight. Thus we
expect some of the satellites in the plane around Andromeda to have high
velocities perpendicular to the plane.

X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) in the field, focusing on black-hole (BH) LMXBs. In this
formation channel LMXBs are formed from wide binaries $(>1000$ AU) with a BH
component and a stellar companion. The wide binary is perturbed by fly-by's of
field stars and its orbit random-walks and changes over time. This diffusion
process can drive the binary into a sufficiently eccentric orbit such that the
binary components tidally interact at peri-center and the binary evolves to
become a short period binary, which eventually evolves into an LMXB. The
formation rate of LMXBs through this channel mostly depends on the number of
such BH wide binaries progenitors, which in turn depends on the velocity kicks
imparted to BHs (or NSs) at birth. We consider several models for the formation
and survival of such wide binaries, and calculate the LMXB formation rates for
each model. We find that models where BHs form through direct collapse with
no/little natal kicks can give rise to high formation rates comparable with
those inferred from observations. This formation scenario had several
observational signatures: (1) the number density of LMXBs generally follows the
background stellar density and (2) the mass function of the BH stellar
companion should be comparable to the mass function of the background stellar
population, likely peaking at $0.4-0.6$ M$_{\odot}$. The latter aspect, in
particular, is unique to this model compared with previously suggested LMXB
formation models following common envelope binary stellar evolution. We note
that NS LMXBs can similarly form from wide binaries, but their formation rate
through this channel is likely significantly smaller due to their much higher
natal kicks.

for cosmology provided the influence of baryons on the total mass distribution
is understood well enough. As hydrodynamical simulations strongly depend on
details in the feedback implementations, no unique and robust predictions for
baryonic effects currently exist. In this paper we propose a baryonic
correction model that modifies the density field of dark-matter-only $N$-body
simulations to mimic the effects of baryons from any underlying adopted
feedback recipe. The model assumes haloes to consist of 4 components: 1- hot
gas in hydrostatical equilibrium, 2- ejected gas from feedback processes, 3-
central galaxy stars, and 4- adiabatically relaxed dark matter, which all
modify the initial dark-matter-only density profiles. These altered profiles
allow to define a displacement field for particles in $N$-body simulations and
to modify the total density field accordingly. The main advantage of the
baryonic correction model is to connect the total matter density field to the
observable distribution of gas and stars in haloes, making it possible to
parametrise baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. We show that the
most crucial quantities are the mass fraction of ejected gas and its
corresponding ejection radius. The former controls how strongly baryons
suppress the power spectrum, while the latter provides a measure of the scale
where baryonic effects become important. A comparison with X-ray and
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster observations suggests that baryons suppress wave
modes above $k\sim0.5$ h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 10-25 percent around
$k\sim 2$ h/Mpc. More detailed observations of the gas in the outskirts of
groups and clusters are required to decrease the large uncertainties of these

primarily based on fibre optic spectroscopy surveys. Elaborate methods have
been developed to address aperture effects when fixed aperture sizes only probe
the inner regions for galaxies of ever decreasing redshift or increasing
physical size. These aperture corrections rely on assumptions about the
physical properties of galaxies. The adequacy of these aperture corrections can
be tested with integral-field spectroscopic data. We use integral-field spectra
drawn from 1212 galaxies observed as part of the SAMI Galaxy Survey to
investigate the validity of two aperture correction methods that attempt to
estimate a galaxy's total instantaneous star formation rate. We show that
biases arise when assuming that instantaneous star formation is traced by
broadband imaging, and when the aperture correction is built only from spectra
of the nuclear region of galaxies. These biases may be significant depending on
the selection criteria of a survey sample. Understanding the sensitivities of
these aperture corrections is essential for correct handling of systematic
errors in galaxy evolution studies.

for predictive simulations. Reducing these uncertainties is critical for
stake-holders to make risk-informed decisions based on numerical simulations.
For example, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are
increasingly used in mission-critical systems involving turbulent flows.
However, for many practical flows the RANS predictions have large model-form
uncertainties originating from the uncertainty in the modeled Reynolds
stresses. Recently, a physics-informed Bayesian framework has been proposed to
quantify and reduce model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by utilizing
sparse observation data. However, in the design stage of engineering systems,
measurement data are usually not available. In the present work we extend the
original framework to scenarios where there are no available data on the flow
to be predicted. In the proposed method, we first calibrate the model
discrepancy on a related flow with available data, leading to a statistical
model for the uncertainty distribution of the Reynolds stress discrepancy. The
obtained distribution is then sampled to correct the RANS-modeled Reynolds
stresses for the flow to be predicted. The extended framework is a Bayesian
calibration-prediction method. The merits of the proposed method are
demonstrated on two flows that are challenging to standard RANS models. By not
requiring observation data on the flow to be predicted, the present
calibration-prediction method will gain wider acceptance in practical
engineering application. While RANS modeling is chosen to demonstrate the
merits of the proposed framework, the methodology is generally applicable to
other complex mechanics models involving solids, fluids flows, or the coupling
between the two, where model-form uncertainties are present in the constitutive
relations.

$\sim$1 m s$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$. High-resolution HERMES/Mercator and Keck/HIRES
spectra have been used to derive elemental abundances using 1-D LTE MARCS
models. A metallicity of [Fe/H] $\sim -2.4$ is found, along with s-process
overabundances on the order of 2 dex (with the exception of [Y/Fe] $\sim+0.5$),
and most notably overabundances of r-process elements like Sm, Eu, Dy, and Er
in the range 0.9 - 2.0 dex. With [Ba/Fe] $ > 1.9$ dex and [Eu/Fe] = 2.3 dex, HE
0017+0055 is a CEMP-rs star. It appears to be a giant star below the tip of the
red giant branch (RGB). The s-process pollution must therefore originate from
mass transfer from a companion formerly on the AGB, now a carbon-oxygen white
dwarf (WD). If the 384 d velocity variations are attributed to the WD
companion, its orbit must be seen almost face-on, with $i \sim 2.3^\circ$,
because the mass function is very small: $f(M_1,M_2) =
(6.1\pm1.1)\times10^{-6}$ Msun. Alternatively, the WD orbital motion could be
responsible for the long-term velocity variations, with a period of several
decades. The 384 d variations should then be attributed either to a low-mass
inner companion (perhaps a brown dwarf, depending on the orbital inclination),
or to stellar pulsations. The latter possibility is made likely by the fact
that similar low-amplitude velocity variations, with periods close to 1 yr,
have been reported for other CEMP stars in a companion paper (Jorissen et al.,
2015). A definite conclusion about the origin of the 384 d velocity variations
should however await the detection of synchronous low-amplitude photometric
variations.

states that are indistinguishable from the point of view of entanglement and
distinguishable from the point of view of quantum discord, states where the two
quantifiers give opposite information and states where they give roughly the
same information about correlations at a certain time. Depending on the initial
conditions, this model exhibits a fascinating range of phenomena that can be
used for experimental purposes such as: Robust states against change of
manifold or dissipation, tunable entanglement states and states with a

structure that can be exploited for dimension reduction in this setting--both
in the parameter space of the inverse problem and in the state space of the

subspaces of the parameter space and the state space in order to accelerate the
Bayesian solution of the inverse problem. As a byproduct of state dimension
reduction, we also show how to identify low-dimensional subspaces of the data
in problems with high-dimensional observations. These subspaces enable
approximation of the posterior as a product of two factors: (i) a projection of
the posterior onto a low-dimensional parameter subspace, wherein the original
likelihood is replaced by an approximation involving a reduced model; and (ii)
the marginal prior distribution on the high-dimensional complement of the
parameter subspace. We present and compare several strategies for constructing
these subspaces using only a limited number of forward and adjoint model
simulations. The resulting posterior approximations can rapidly be
characterized using standard sampling techniques, e.g., Markov chain Monte

relevant for ILC are presented. The chief distinction of this tube from MBKs
already developed for ILC is its low operating voltage of 60 kV, a virtue that
implies considerable technological simplifications in the accelerator complex.
To demonstrate the concept underlying the tubes design, a six-beamlet quadrant
(a 54 inch high one-quarter portion of the full 1.3 GHz tube) was built and
recently underwent initial tests, with main goals of demonstrating rated gun
perveance, rated gain, and at least one-quarter of the full 10-MW rated power.
Our initial three-day conditioning campaign without RF drive (140 microsec
pulses @ 60 Hz) was stopped at 53% of full rated duty because of time-limits at
the test-site; no signs appeared that would seem to prevent achieving full duty
operation (i.e., 1.6 msec pulses @ 10 Hz). The subsequent tests with 10-15
microsec RF pulses confirmed the rated gain, produced output powers of up to
2.86 MW at 60 kV with high efficiency and 56 dB gain, and showed acceptable
beam interception. These results suggest that a full version of the tube should
be able to produce up to 11.5 MW. Follow-on tests are planned for later in

the Higgs a pseudo-Goldstone of a global $SU(4)$ symmetry that is spontaneously
broken to $SU(3)$. Gauge and Yukawa couplings, which explicitly break $SU(4)$,
enjoy a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that accidentally maintains $SU(4)$ at
the quadratic level and therefore keeps the Higgs light. Contrary to most
beyond the Standard Model theories, the quadratically divergent corrections to
the Higgs mass are cancelled by a mirror sector, which is uncharged under the
Standard Model groups. However, the Twin Higgs with an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry leads to equal vevs in the Standard Model and mirror sectors, which is
phenomenologically unviable. An explicit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking potential must
then be introduced and tuned against the $SU(4)$ breaking terms to produce a
hierarchy of vevs between the two sectors. This leads to a moderate but
non-negligible tuning. We propose a model to alleviate this tuning, without the
need for an explicit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking sector. The model consists of two
$SU(4)$ fundamental Higgses, one whose vacuum preserves $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and one
whose vacuum breaks it. As the interactions between the two Higgses are turned
on, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking is transmitted from the broken to the unbroken
sector and a small hierarchy of vevs is naturally produced. The presence of an
effective tadpole and feedback between the two Higgses lead to a sizable
improvement of the tuning. The resulting Higgs boson is naturally very Standard
Model like.

of the star-formation rate stellar mass relation (SFR-M*). Using data from the
FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging
from the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR-M* relation at
0.5 < z < 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared SEDs of
galaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad
range of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.
We find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power-law of
the form SFR ~ M*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at low
masses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M_0) that ranges from
10^9.5 - 10^10.8 Msol, with evidence that M_0 increases with redshift. We
compare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological
simulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation
albeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR-M* sequence to generate
SFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and
decline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive
galaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass-growth histories and compare
to the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. We
find that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that
there is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs
suggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from the
stellar mass function. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the
inferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to
mergers.

the probability of acquiring them is sufficiently high, bacteria develop a
diverse population of spacers. On the other hand, if spacers differ mainly in

Sparsity-inducing regularization methods are a popular class of methods that
simultaneously perform variable selection and model estimation. The central
problem is a quadratic optimization problem with an l0-norm penalty. Exactly
enforcing the l0-norm penalty is computationally intractable for larger scale
problems, so dif- ferent sparsity-inducing penalty functions that approximate
the l0-norm have been introduced. In this paper, we show that viewing the
problem from a convex relaxation perspective offers new insights. In
particular, we show that a popular sparsity-inducing concave penalty function
known as the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), and the reverse Huber penalty
derived in a recent work by Pilanci, Wainwright and Ghaoui, can both be derived
as special cases of a lifted convex relaxation called the perspective
relaxation. The optimal perspective relaxation is a related minimax problem
that balances the overall convexity and tightness of approximation to the l0
norm. We show it can be solved by a semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, a
probabilistic interpretation of the semidefinite relaxation reveals connections
with the boolean quadric polytope in combinatorial optimization. Finally by
reformulating the l0-norm pe- nalized problem as a two-level problem, with the
inner level being a Max-Cut problem, our proposed semidefinite relaxation can
be realized by replacing the inner level problem with its semidefinite
relaxation studied by Goemans and Williamson. This interpretation suggests
using the Goemans-Williamson rounding procedure to find approximate solutions
to the l0-norm penalized problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
tightness of our proposed semidefinite relaxation, and the effectiveness of
finding approximate solutions by Goemans-Williamson rounding.

shock driven by a coronal mass ejection launched from the Sun earlier that same
day. The estimated travel time of the disturbance ($\sim 20$ hrs), together
with the massive magnetic field strengths measured within the ejecta ($>
100$nT), made it one of the most extreme events observed during the space era.
In this study, we examine the properties of the shock wave. Because of an
instrument malfunction, plasma measurements during the interval surrounding the
CME were limited, and our approach has been modified to capitalize on the
available measurements and suitable proxies, where possible. We were able to
infer the following properties. First, the shock normal was pointing
predominantly in the radial direction (${\bf n} = 0.97 {\bf e}_r -0.09 {\bf
e}_t -0.23 {\bf e}_n$). Second, the angle between ${\bf n}$ and the upstream
magnetic field, $\theta_{Bn}$, was estimated to be $\approx 34^{\circ}$, making
the shock ""quasi-parallel,"" and supporting the idea of an earlier
""preconditioning"" ICME. Third, the shock speed was estimated to be $\approx
3300$ km s$^{-1}$. Fourth, the sonic Mach number, $M_s$, for this shock was
$\sim 28$. We support these results with an idealized numerical simulation of
the ICME. Finally, we estimated the change in ram pressure upstream of the
shock to be $\sim 5$ times larger than the pressure from the energetic
particles, suggesting that this was not a standard ""steady-state"" cosmic-ray
modified shock (CRMS). Instead it might represent an early, transient phase in
the evolution of the CRMS.

unreliable source; yet many studies suggest that Wikipedia is even more
accurate and self-consistent than traditional encyclopedias. Scholars have
attempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the
number of edits as the unit of time, without consideration of real time. In
this work, we probe the formation of such collective intelligence through a
systematic analysis using the entire history of 34,534,110 English Wikipedia
articles, between 2001 and 2014. From this massive data set, we observe the
universality of both timewise and lengthwise editing scales, which suggests
that it is essential to consider the real-time dynamics. By considering real
time, we find the existence of distinct growth patterns that are unobserved by
utilizing the number of edits as the unit of time. To account for these
results, we present a mechanistic model that adopts the article editing
dynamics based on both editor-editor and editor-article interactions. The model
successfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as
distinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the
interrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article
size. In addition, the model indicates that infrequently referred articles tend
to grow faster than frequently referred ones, and articles attracting a high
motivation to edit counterintuitively reduce the number of participants. We
suggest that this decay of participants eventually brings inequality among the
editors, which will become more severe with time.

hierarchical framework and construct a likelihood function to determine the
probability that any particular IFMR fits a sample of wide DWDs. We then define
a parametric model for the IFMR and find the best parameters indicated by our

range differ from those predicted by semi-empirical fits to open cluster WDs.
Within this mass range, where there are few constraining open cluster WDs and

Consequently, further increases in coherence time are very desirable. In this
letter, we blueprint a simple circuit consisting of two transmon qubits and two
additional lossy qubits or resonators, which is passively protected against all
single qubit quantum error channels through a combination of continuous driving
and engineered dissipation. Photon losses are rapidly corrected through
two-photon drive fields implemented with driven SQUID couplings, and dephasing
from random potential fluctuations is heavily suppressed by the drive fields
used to implement the multi-qubit Hamiltonian. Comparing our theoretical model
to published noise estimates from recent experiments on flux and transmon
qubits, we find that logical state coherence could be improved by a factor of
forty or more compared to the individual qubit $T_1$ and $T_2$ using this

content. This shift creates the opportunity to cache part of the content in
memories closer to the end users, for example in base stations. Most of the
prior literature focuses on the reduction of load in the backhaul and core
networks due to caching, i.e., on the benefits caching offers for the wireline
communication link between the origin server and the caches. In this paper, we
are instead interested in the benefits caching can offer for the wireless
communication link between the caches and the end users.
  To quantify the gains of caching for this wireless link, we consider an
interference channel in which each transmitter is equipped with an isolated
cache memory. Communication takes place in two phases, a content placement
phase followed by a content delivery phase. The objective is to design both the
placement and the delivery phases to maximize the rate in the delivery phase in
response to any possible user demands. Focusing on the three-user case, we show
that through careful joint design of these phases, we can reap three distinct
benefits from caching: a load balancing gain, an interference cancellation
gain, and an interference alignment gain. In our proposed scheme, load
balancing is achieved through a specific file splitting and placement,
producing a particular pattern of content overlap at the caches. This overlap
allows to implement interference cancellation. Further, it allows us to create
several virtual transmitters, each transmitting a part of the requested
content, which increases interference-alignment possibilities.

substructure (denoted as the \it{narrow stripe}) located from (age,
[Fe/H])$\sim$(5, 0.4) to (10 Gyr, -0.4 dex) in the age--metallicity map is
clearly identified. Moreover, the \it{narrow stripe} stars are found the
dominate contributors to several velocity substructures, including the
well-known Hercules stream. The substantially large difference between the
observed guiding-center radii and the birth radii inferred from the
age--metallicity relation is evident that the \it{narrow stripe} stars have
been radially migrated from about R$\sim4$ kpc to the solar neighborhood. This
implies that the Hercules stream may not be owe to the resonance associated
with the bar, but may be the kinematic imprint of the inner disk and later
moved out due to radial migration. We estimate that the traveling speed of the
radial migration are roughly 1.1$\pm0.1$ kpc Gyr$^{-1}$, equivalent with about
$1.1\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$. This is in agreement with the median $v_R$ of
$2.6^{+1.8}_{-1.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ of the \it{narrow stripe}. We also obtain that
about one third stars in the solar neighborhood are radially migrated from
around 4 kpc. Finally, we find that the radial migration does not lead to

Specifically, we address two highly relevant aspects: 1) A successful KT
requires the emergence of organized bodies of inter-and transdisciplinary

bodies of knowledge. We focused on a set of previously-published studies on KT
which rely on a combination of network analysis and computer-assisted analysis
of the contents of scientific literature and patents. The selected studies
provide a duo of complementary perspectives: the demand of knowledge (cervical
cancer and Ebola hemorrhagic fever) and the supply of knowledge (liposomes and

across a layered superlattice, provided that certain growth conditions are

functionalities based on these guidelines, often with remarkable success. Such
principles, however, are of limited practical use unless one disposes of
reliable data on how a given material behaves under arbitrary electrical and
mechanical boundary conditions. Here we demonstrate, by focusing on the
prototypical ferroelectrics PbTiO3 and BiFeO3 as testcases, how such
information can be calculated from first principles in a systematic and
efficient way. In particular, we construct a series of two-dimensional maps
that describe the behavior of either compound (e.g. concerning the
ferroelectric polarization and antiferrodistortive instabilities) at any
conceivable choice of the in-plane lattice parameter, a, and out-of-plane

applicability to superlattice design, our results bring new insight into the

predicted to display a magneto-electric effect that causes the electric and
magnetic induction fields to mix at the material's surface. This effect induces
polarization rotations of between ~1-10 mrad per interface in incident
plane-polarized light normal to a multilayered structure. Here we show,
theoretically and numerically, that, using a waveguide geometry with a
topological insulator guide layer and dielectric cladding, it is possible to
achieve rotations of between ~100-1000 mrad and generate an elliptical
polarization with only a three-layered structure. Both the rotation angle and
ellipticity are dependent on the permittivity contrast of the guide and
cladding layers and the strength of the time-symmetry-breaking perturbation.
This geometry is beneficial, not only as a way to enhance the magneto-electric
effect, rendering it easier to observe, but also as a method for controlling
the polarization of light in the next generation of photonic devices.

  Optimization over Fixed Point Sets of Quasi-Nonexpansive Mappings",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a networked system with a finite number of users and
supposes that each user tries to minimize its own private objective function
over its own private constraint set. It is assumed that each user's constraint
set can be expressed as a fixed point set of a certain quasi-nonexpansive
mapping. This enables us to consider the case in which the projection onto the
constraint set cannot be computed efficiently. This paper proposes two methods
for solving the problem of minimizing the sum of their nondifferentiable,
convex objective functions over the intersection of their fixed point sets of
quasi-nonexpansive mappings in a real Hilbert space. One method is a parallel
subgradient method that can be implemented under the assumption that each user
can communicate with other users. The other is an incremental subgradient
method that can be implemented under the assumption that each user can
communicate with its neighbors. Investigation of the two methods' convergence
properties for a constant step size reveals that, with a small constant step
size, they approximate a solution to the problem. Consideration of the case in
which the step-size sequence is diminishing demonstrates that the sequence
generated by each of the two methods strongly converges to the solution to the
problem under certain assumptions. Convergence rate analysis of the two methods
under certain situations is provided to illustrate the two methods' efficiency.
This paper also discusses nonsmooth convex optimization over sublevel sets of

interaction with stellar photons, producing interstellar extinction. However,
owing to the physical extension of the observing beam, observations may detect
scattered photons, resulting in a change in the observed (or effective)
extinction, depending on the spatial distribution of the dust and the
resolution of the instrument. We investigate the influence of clumpy dust
distributions on effective extinction toward embedded sources and those in the
diffuse ISM. We use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to examine effective
extinction for various geometries. By varying the number, optical depth and
volume-filling factor of clumps in models of spherical shells and the diffuse
ISM, we explore the evolution of extinction. Depending on the number of
scattering events in the beam, the extinction curve steepens in homogeneous
media and flattens in clumpy media. As a result, clumpy dust distributions can
to reproduce extinction curves with arbitrary R_v, the effective ratio of
total-to-selective extinction. The flattening `washes out' the 2175 \AA bump
and shifts the peak to shorter wavelengths. The mean R_v of a shell correlates
with the optical depth of an individual clump and the wavelength at which a
clump becomes optically thick. Similar behaviour is seen for edge-on discs or
tori. However, at grazing inclinations the combination of extinction and strong
forward scattering results in chaotic behaviour. Caution is therefore advised
when measuring extinction in, for example, AGN tori or toward SNIa or GRB
afterglows. In face-on discs, the shape of the scattered continuum changes with
clumpiness, however, unlike absorption features, individual features in the
scattering cross-sections are preserved. Finally, we show that diffuse
interstellar extinction is not modified by scattering on scales of a few kpc.

and profile variations of some permitted and forbidden emission lines of
metallic ions and the behavior of the Balmer and HeI lines has been
investigated as well.
  The RV of the absorption lines clearly shows a 60-day periodicity. A dense
coverage of the RV curve allowed us to derive accurate orbital parameters. The
RV of the FeII emission lines varies in the same way, but with a smaller
amplitude. Additionally, the intensity ratio of the blue/red peaks of these
emission lines correlates with the RV variations. The Balmer lines and {NII]
lines display a nearly constant RV and no profile variations in phase with the
orbital motion instead. The HeI-5876 \AA\ line shows a strongly variable
profile with broad and blue-shifted absorption components reaching velocities
of <-1000 km/s at some specific orbital phases. Our data strongly suggest that
the object is a binary system composed from a supergiant B[e] star and an
undetected companion. The emission lines with a non-variable RV could originate
in a circumbinary region. For the FeII emission lines we propose a simple
geometrical two-component model where a compact source of FeII emission, moving
around the center of mass, is affected by a static extra absorption that
originates from a larger area. Finally, the blue-shifted absorption in the

used to describe phenomena on the quantum-classical border; in particular,
quantum measurement. Although containing nonlinear dynamics and thereby exposed
to the possibility of superluminal signaling in individual events, such models
are widely accepted on the basis of fully reproducing the non-signaling
statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. Here we present a deterministic
nonlinear model without any external noise, in which randomness - instead of
being universally present - emerges in the measurement process, from
deterministic irregular dynamics of the detectors. The treatment is based on a
minimally nonlinear von Neumann equation for a Stern-Gerlach or Bell-type
measuring setup, containing coordinate and momentum operators in a self-adjoint
skew-symmetric, split scalar product structure over the configuration space.
The microscopic states of the detectors act as a nonlocal set of hidden
parameters, controlling individual outcomes. The model is shown to display
pumping of weights between setup-defined basis states, with a single winner
randomly selected and the rest collapsing to zero. Environmental decoherence
has no role in the scenario. Through stochastic modelling, based on Pearle's
""gambler's ruin"" scheme, outcome probabilities are shown to obey Born's rule
under a no-drift or ""fair-game"" condition. This fully reproduces quantum
statistical predictions, implying that the proposed non-linear deterministic
model satisfies the non-signaling requirement. Our treatment is still
vulnerable to hidden signaling in individual events, which remains to be
handled by future research.

The trace of this matrix is shown to measure the degree of equilibration of the
system launched from a typical state, from the standpoint of the chosen basis.
This approach is substantiated by an in-depth study of the example of a
tight-binding particle in one dimension. In the regime of free ballistic
propagation, the above trace saturates to a finite limit, testifying good
equilibration. In the presence of a random potential, the trace grows linearly
with the system size, testifying poor equilibration in the insulating regime
induced by Anderson localization. In the weak-disorder situation of most
interest, a universal finite-size scaling law describes the crossover between
the ballistic and localized regimes. The associated crossover exponent 2/3 is

center on 2014 January 7 and was associated with an X1.2 flare. A new CME
reconstruction procedure based on a polarimetric technique is adopted, which
shows that the CME changed its propagation direction by around 28$^\circ$ in
latitude within 2.5 R$_\odot$ and 43$^\circ$ in longitude within 6.5 R$_\odot$
with respect to the CME source region. This significant non-radial motion is
consistent with the finding of M$\ddot{o}$stl et al. (2015). We use nonlinear
force-free field (NLFFF) and potential field source surface (PFSS)
extrapolation methods to determine the configurations of the coronal magnetic
field. We also calculate the magnetic energy density distributions at different

coronal magnetic field has a strong influence on the CME propagation direction.
This is consistent with the ""channelling"" by the active region coronal magnetic
field itself, rather than deflection by nearby structures. These results
indicate that the active region coronal magnetic field configuration has to be
taken into account in order to determine CME propagation direction correctly.

stream. The interstellar grains act as tracers of the physical conditions in
the local interstellar medium surrounding our solar system. Earlier analyses of
the Ulysses ISD data measured between 1992 and 1998 implied the existence of
'big' ISD grains [up to 10^-13kg]. The derived gas-to-dust-mass ratio was
smaller than the one derived from astronomical observations, implying a
concentration of ISD in the very local interstellar medium. We analyse the
entire data set from 16 yr of Ulysses ISD measurements in interplanetary space.
This paper concentrates on the overall mass distribution of ISD. An
accompanying paper investigates time-variable phenomena in the Ulysses ISD
data, and in a third paper we present the results from dynamical modelling of
the ISD flow applied to Ulysses. We use the latest values for the interstellar
hydrogen and helium densities, the interstellar helium flow speed of
v_ISM,inf=23.2km/s, and the ratio of radiation pressure to gravity, beta,
calculated for astronomical silicates. We find a gas-to-dust-mass ratio in the
local interstellar cloud of R_g/d=193^+85_-57, and a dust density of
2.1+/-0.6x10^-24kg/m^3. For a higher inflow speed of 26km/s, the
gas-to-dust-mass ratio is 20% higher, and, accordingly, the dust density is
lower by the same amount. The gas-to-dust mass ratio derived from our new
analysis is compatible with the value most recently determined from
astronomical observations. We confirm earlier results that the very local
interstellar medium contains 'big' (i.e. 1 um-sized) ISD grains. We find a dust
density in the local interstellar medium that is a factor of three lower than

radiative transfer models of both spin species of H2O, spanning a considerable
parameter space in number density, kinetic temperature and dust temperature.
Results, in the form of maser optical depths, have been summarized in a master
table, Table 6. Maser transitions identified in these models were grouped
according to loci of inverted regions in the density/kinetic temperature plane,
a property clearly related to the dominant mode of pumping. A more detailed
study of the effect of dust temperature on maser optical depth enabled us to
divide the maser transitions into three groups: those with both collisional and
radiative pumping schemes (22,96,209,321,325,395,941 and 1486\,GHz), a much
larger set that are predominantly radiatively pumped, and another large group
with a predominantly collisional pump. The effect of accelerative and
decelerative velocity shifts of up to 5km/s was found to be generally modest,
with the primary effect of reducing computed maser optical depths. More subtle
asymmetric effects, dependent on line overlap, include maximum gains offset
from zero shift by >1km/s, but these effects were predominantly found under
conditions of weak amplification. These models will allow astronomers to use
multi-transition water maser observations to constrain physical conditions down
to the size of individual masing clouds (size of a few astronomical units).

{\Gamma} ~ 10, closely aligned along our line of sight. In a number of blazars
of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar type such as 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 gamma-ray
flares have recently been detected with very high luminosity and little or no
counterparts in the optical and soft X-ray bands. They challenge the current
one-zone leptonic models of emissions from within the broad line region. The
latter envisage the optical/X-ray emissions to be produced as synchrotron
radiation by the same population of highly relativistic electrons in the jet
that would also yield the gamma rays by inverse Compton up-scattering of
surrounding soft photons. To meet the challenge we present here a model based
on primary synchrotron photons emitted in the broad line region by a plasmoid
moving out with the jet and scattered back toward the incoming plasmoid by an
outer plasma clump acting as a mirror. We consider both a scenario based on a
static mirror located outside the BLR, and an alternative provided by a moving
mirror geometry. We show that mirroring phenomena can locally enhance the
density and anisotropy with associated relativistic boosting of soft photons
within the jet, so as to trigger bright inverse Compton gamma-ray transients
from nearly steady optical/X-ray synchrotron emissions. In this picture we
interpret the peculiarly asymmetric lightcurves of the recently detected
gamma-ray flares from 3C 279. Our scenario provides a promising start to

the limited throughput of the interface buffer and determine the IBEX spin-axis

Subsequently, we analyze the data from 2009 to examine the role of various

identify the WB as the principal contributor to the global $\chi^2$ values in

contributions are comparable to each other. The application of this uncertainty
system reduced the minimum $\chi^2$ value 4-fold. The obtained $\chi^2$ value,
still exceeding the expected value, suggests that either the uncertainty system
may still be incomplete or the adopted physical model lacks a potentially
important element, which is likely an imperfect determination of the WB

review, we summarize our recent work on electrode/channel contacts and carrier
scattering mechanisms to address the origins of this adverse thickness
dependence. Extrinsically, the Schottky barrier height increases at the
electrode/channel contact area in thin channels owing to bandgap expansion
caused by quantum confinement, which hinders carrier injection and degrades
device performance. Intrinsically, thin channels tend to suffer from
intensified Coulomb impurity scattering, resulting from the reduced interaction
distance between interfacial impurities and channel carriers. Both factors are
responsible for the adverse dependence of carrier mobility on channel thickness
in two-dimensional semiconductors.

maximize the value of nodes which are influenced. This problem is NP-hard. To

experimental results show that BWR can achieve excellent approximation and
faster than greedy algorithm more than three orders of magnitude with little

need to stabilize the electroweak vacuum, the mass of the Higgs boson, and the
fact that its couplings are Standard Model-like (so far). The prospects for
discovering (and measuring) supersymmetry during future runs of the LHC are
discussed in the frameworks of the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), models with
non-universal soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to Higgs masses
(NUHM1,2) and the phenomenological MSSM with 10 arbitrary soft
supersymmetry-breaking parameters (pMSSM10). In addition to the classic
searches for missing transverse energy, searches for long-lived charged
sparticles may also be promising. If supersymmetry does show up at the LHC,
there are good prospects for measurements of the spectrum that can be compared
with the indirect indications from other experiments. On the other hand, a
higher-energy future circular proton-proton collider may be the best option for
discovering supersymmetry if it does not appear at the LHC.

neutral gas. The damped Lya systems (DLAs), seen in absorption towards distant
quasars and gamma-ray bursts, are predicted to be the dominant reservoirs for
this gas. Detailed properties of DLAs have been studied extensively for decades
with great success. However, their size, fundamental in understanding their
nature, has remained elusive, as quasar and gamma-ray-burst sightlines only
probe comparatively tiny areas of the foreground DLAs. Here, we introduce a new
approach to measure the full extent of DLAs in the sightlines toward extended
background sources. We present the discovery of a high-column-density (log
N(HI) = 21.1 +/-0.4 cm^-2) DLA at z ~ 2.4 covering 90-100% of the luminous
extent of a line-of-sight background galaxy. Estimates of the size of the
background galaxy range from a minimum of a few kpc^2, to ~100 kpc^2, and
demonstrate that high-column density neutral gas can span continuous areas 10^8
- 10^10 times larger than previously explored in quasar or gamma-ray burst
sightlines. The DLA presented here is the first from a sample of DLAs in our
pilot survey that searches Lyman break and Lyman continuum galaxies at high
redshift. The low luminosities, large sizes, and mass contents (>~10^6 - 10^9
M_solar) implied by this DLA and the early data suggest that DLAs contain the
necessary fuel for galaxies, with many systems consistent with relatively
massive, low-luminosity primeval galaxies.

the range of applications of the functional delta-method for the asymptotic

differentiable functionals bootstrap consistency of the plug-in estimator
follows from bootstrap consistency of the respective empirical process. This
enlargement often requires convergence in distribution of the bootstrapped

PrMnO3 are found to be associated with magnetic origin. In spite of similarity
of the structure of the two compounds, the neutron inelastic spectrum of PrMnO3
exhibits broad features at 150 K unlike well-defined peaks in the spectrum of
CaMnO3. This might result from the difference in nature of interactions in the
two compounds (magnetic and Jahn-Teller distortion). The interpretation and
analysis of the observed phonon spectra have been performed using ab-initio
phonon calculations. We also discuss the effect of pressure on the structural
distortions in the orthorhombic phase of CaMnO3 and PrMnO3. On application of
pressure, we found that the variations of Mn-O distances are isotropic for
CaMnO3 and highly anisotropic for PrMnO3. The calculated structure as a
function of pressure in PrMnO3 shows that suppression of Jahn-Teller distortion
and insulator to metal transition occurs simultaneously. Our calculations show
that this transition may not be associated with the occurrence of the
tetragonal phase above 20 GPa as reported in the literature, since the
tetragonal phase is found to be dynamically unstable although it is found to be
energetically favored over the orthorhombic phase above 20 GPa. CaMnO3 does not

Lie algebra. Ostensibly it provides only a parametrisation of the

combinatorial structure from which one may read of a parametrisation of the
corresponding basis for any integrable highest weight module, describe the
decomposition of the tensor products of highest weight modules, the Demazure
submodules of integrable highest weight modules and Demazure flags for
translates of Demazure modules. $B(\infty)$ has in general infinitely many
presentations as subsets of countably many copies of the natural numbers each
given by successive reduced decompositions of Weyl group elements. In each
presentation there is an action of Kashiwara operators determined by Kashiwara
functions. These functions are linear in the entries. Thus a natural question
is to show that in each presentation the subset $B(\infty)$ is polyhedral. Here
a new approach to this question is initiated based on constructing dual
Kashiwara functions and in this it is enough to show that the latter are also
linear in the entries.
  The present work resolves one of the two very difficult obstacles in a
step-wise construction, namely that the resulting functions must satisfy a sum,
or simply S, condition. It depends very subtly on inequalities between the
coefficients occurring in functions obtained from the previous step. The only
remaining obstacle, that sufficiently many functions are obtained, can at least
be verified in many families of cases, though this is to be postponed to a
subsequent paper.
  This theory has some intriguing numerology which involves the Catalan numbers

in the outer core. For numerical reasons, inertial and viscous forces play an
important role in geodynamo models; however, the primary dynamical balance in
the Earth's core is believed to be between buoyancy, Coriolis and magnetic
forces. The hope has been that by setting the Ekman number to be as small as
computationally feasible, an asymptotic regime would be reached in which the
correct force balance is achieved. However, recent analyses of geodynamo models
suggest that the desired balance has still not yet been attained. Here we adopt
a complementary approach consisting of a model of rapidly rotating convection
in which inertial forces are neglected from the outset. Within this framework
we are able to construct a new branch of solutions in which the dynamo
generates a strong magnetic field that satisfies the expected force balance.
The resulting strongly magnetized convection is dramatically different to the
corresponding solutions in which the field is weak.

respect to an idempotent. This definition abstracts properties of endomorphism
algebras of (d-1)-cluster-tilting objects in certain stably (d-1)-Calabi-Yau
Frobenius categories, as observed by Keller-Reiten. We show that an internally
d-Calabi-Yau algebra satisfying mild additional assumptions can be realised as
the endomorphism algebra of a (d-1)-cluster-tilting object in a Frobenius
category. Moreover, if the algebra satisfies a stronger 'bimodule' internally
d-Calabi-Yau condition, this Frobenius category is stably (d-1)-Calabi-Yau. We
pay special attention to frozen Jacobian algebras; in particular, we define a
candidate bimodule resolution for such an algebra, and show that if this
complex is indeed a resolution, then the frozen Jacobian algebra is bimodule
internally 3-Calabi-Yau with respect to its frozen idempotent. These results
suggest a new method for constructing Frobenius categories modelling cluster
algebras with frozen variables, by first constructing a suitable candidate for
the endomorphism algebra of a cluster-tilting object in such a category,
analogous to Amiot's construction in the coefficient-free case.

in the early phase of high-mass star formation. The inward motion of molecular
gas in the massive star forming region G34.26+0.15 is investigated by using
high-resolution profiles of seven transitions of ammonia at THz frequencies
observed with Herschel-HIFI. The shapes and intensities of these lines are
interpreted in terms of radiative transfer models of a spherical, collapsing
molecular envelope. An accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) method is used to
compute the models. The seven ammonia lines show mixed absorption and emission
with inverse P-Cygni-type profiles that suggest infall onto the central source.
A trend toward absorption at increasingly higher velocities for higher
excitation transitions is clearly seen in the line profiles. The $J =
3\leftarrow2$ lines show only very weak emission, so these absorption profiles
can be used directly to analyze the inward motion of the gas. This is the first
time a multitransitional study of spectrally resolved rotational ammonia lines
has been used for this purpose. Broad emission is, in addition, mixed with the
absorption in the $1_0-0_0$ ortho-NH$_3$ line, possibly tracing a molecular
outflow from the star forming region. The best-fitting ALI model reproduces the
continuum fluxes and line profiles, but slightly underpredicts the emission and
absorption depth in the ground-state ortho line $1_0-0_0$. The derived
ortho-to-para ratio is approximately 0.5 throughout the infalling cloud core
similar to recent findings for translucent clouds in sight lines toward W31C
and W49N. We find evidence of two gas components moving inwards toward the
central region with constant velocities: 2.7 and 5.3 km$\,$s$^{-1}$, relative
to the source systemic velocity. The inferred mass accretion rates derived are
sufficient to overcome the expected radiation pressure from G34.26+0.15.

However, in this paper we show that this is not the case for blind decryption.
We formulate a definition of perfect secrecy of symmetric blind decryption for

  Losses of Roebel Cables",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Roebel cables made of HTS coated conductors are regarded as promising cables
for winding applications in virtue of their large engineering current density
and low losses. The composing meander-shaped strands are assembled very tightly
into the cable, which results in a strong electromagnetic interaction between
them. This interaction profoundly influences the effective self-field critical
current ($I_c$) of the cable, which is much lower than the sum of the $I_c$s of
the composing strands. Also the AC losses are influenced by the material's
properties and by the geometrical configuration of the cable. Being able to
predict the effective critical current and AC losses of such cables is very
important for a proper design of applications: due to the complexity of the
cable's geometry and of the material's properties, this prediction can only be
performed with advanced numerical tools.
  In this contribution we use finite-element-based models to compute the
effective $I_c$ and the AC losses of Roebel cables composed of 31 strands using
tapes from two manufacturers. The AC losses are analyzed in the simultaneous
presence of transport current and background perpendicular field proportional
to the current, which mirrors the situation occurring in a winding. Our models
include the angular dependence of $J_c(B,\theta)$ at~77 K, which is very
different for the two materials.
  By means of a successful comparison of the simulation results to experimental
data obtained with a calorimetric method measuring the evaporation of liquid
nitrogen, this work confirms the applicability and efficiency of our numerical
techniques for simulating the electromagnetic behavior of Roebel cables and

we calibrated in flux and corrected for telluric absorption and we
systematically searched for absorption and emission features. The source was
detected starting from ~6300 Ang down to 24000 Ang with an intensity comparable
to the one of its 2MASS counterpart and a mostly featureless spectrum. The
continuum lacks absorption features and thus is non-stellar in origin and
likely non-thermal. On top of this spectrum we detected three emission lines
that we interpret as the Halpha-[NII] complex, the [SII] 6716,6731 doublet and
the [SIII] 9530 line, obtaining a redshift estimate of z= 0.2321 +/- 0.0004.
The equivalent width of the Halpha-[NII] complex implies that PMN J1603-4904
does not follow the observational definition of BL Lac, the line ratios suggest
that a LINER/Seyfert nucleus is powering the emission. This new redshift
measurement implies that the X-ray line previously detected should be
interpreted as a 6.7 keV line which is very peculiar.

rotated away in the Yukawa Lagrangian and, therefore, the heavy symmetry states

descriptions are analyzed suggesting that if the usual Yukawa couplings are
suppressed, leptogenesis still occurs due to a new interacting vertex with
fermion triplet $T$, fermion singlets $N$, and an ad-hoc scalar triplet,
$\Sigma$, which now is included to mediate the interactions. The evaluated CP
violation is enough to generate the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry even
in the minimal $1N+1T$ case (independently of $\alpha$) or in the $2N+1T$

to leptogenesis due to new diagrams which are now possible even with the

protoplanetary-disc dead zones. A small adverse radial entropy gradient,
ordinarily stabilised by rotation, excites oscillatory convection (`convective
overstability') when thermal diffusion, or cooling, is neither too strong nor
too weak. I revisit the linear theory of the instability, discuss its
prevalence in protoplanetary discs, and show that unstable modes are exact
nonlinear solutions in the local Boussinesq limit. Overstable modes cannot grow
indefinitely, however, as they are subject to a secondary parametric
instability that limits their amplitudes to relatively low levels. If parasites
set the saturation level of the ensuing turbulence then the convective
overstability is probably too weak to drive significant angular momentum
transport or to generate vortices. But I also discuss an alternative, and far
more vigorous, saturation route that generates radial `layers' or `zonal flows'
(witnessed also in semiconvection). Numerical simulations are required to
determine which outcome is favoured in realistic discs, and consequently how
important the instability is for disc dynamics.

atomic stress tensor. These atomic stress tensors can be used to describe
liquids' structures and to investigate the connection between structural and
dynamic properties. In particular, atomic stresses allow to address atomic
scale correlations relevant to the Green-Kubo expression for viscosity.
Previously correlations between the atomic stresses of different atoms were
studied using the Cartesian representation of the stress tensors or the
representation based on spherical harmonics. In this paper we address
structural correlations in a model 3D binary liquid using the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the atomic stress tensors. Thus correlations relevant to the
Green-Kubo expression for viscosity are interpreted in a simple geometric way.
On decrease of temperature the changes in the relevant stress correlation
function between different atoms are significantly more pronounced than the
changes in the pair density function. We demonstrate that this behaviour
originates from the orientational correlations between the eigenvectors of the
atomic stress tensors. We also found correlations between the eigenvalues of
the same atomic stress tensor. For the studied system, with purely repulsive
interactions between the particles, the eigenvalues of every atomic stress
tensor are positive and they can be ordered: $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq
\lambda_3 \geq 0$. We found that, for the particles of a given type, the
probability distributions of the ratios $(\lambda_2/\lambda_1)$ and
$(\lambda_3/\lambda_2)$ are essentially identical to each other in the liquids
state. We also found that $\lambda_2$ tends to be equal to the geometric
average of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_3$. In our view, correlations between the
eigenvalues may represent ""the Poisson ratio effect"" at the atomic scale.

candidate set of (typically nonlinear) dose-response models using
likelihood-ratio tests. For the considered models this reduces to assessing
whether the slope parameter in these nonlinear regression models is zero or
not. A technical problem is that the null distribution (when the slope is zero)
depends on non-identifiable parameters, so that standard asymptotic results on
the distribution of the likelihood-ratio test no longer apply. Asymptotic
solutions for this problem have been extensively discussed in the literature.
The resulting approximations however are not of simple form and require
simulation to calculate the asymptotic distribution. In addition their
appropriateness might be doubtful for the case of a small sample size. Direct
simulation to approximate the null distribution is numerically unstable due to
the non identifiability of some parameters. In this article we derive a
numerical algorithm to approximate the exact distribution of the
likelihood-ratio test under multiple models for normally distributed data. The
algorithm uses methods from differential geometry and can be used to evaluate
the distribution under the null hypothesis, but also allows for power and
sample size calculations. We compare the proposed testing approach to the
MCP-Mod methodology and alternative methods for testing for a dose-related
trend in a dose-finding example data set and simulations.

recommended zero points for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude
scales. The resolution was proposed by the IAU Inter-Division A-G Working Group
on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy after consulting with a
broad spectrum of researchers from the astronomical community. Resolution B2
resolves the long-standing absence of an internationally-adopted zero point for
the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. Resolution B2 defines
the zero point of the absolute bolometric magnitude scale such that a radiation
source with $M_{\rm Bol}$ = 0 has luminosity L$_{\circ}$ = 3.0128e28 W. The
zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale ($m_{\rm Bol}$ = 0)
corresponds to irradiance $f_{\circ}$ = 2.518021002e-8 W/m$^2$. The zero points
were chosen so that the nominal solar luminosity (3.828e26 W) adopted by IAU
2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to $M_{\rm Bol}$(Sun) = 4.74, the
value most commonly adopted in recent literature. The nominal total solar
irradiance (1361 W/m$^2$) adopted in IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds
approximately to apparent bolometric magnitude $m_{\rm bol}$(Sun) = -26.832.
Implicit in the IAU 2015 Resolution B2 definition of the apparent bolometric
magnitude scale is an exact definition for the parsec (648000/$\pi$ au) based
on the IAU 2012 Resolution B2 definition of the astronomical unit.

of the BEC dark matter to the galactic cluster scale, involving dark matter
dominated astrophysical systems formed of thousands of galaxies each. By
considering that one of the major components of a galactic cluster, the
intra-cluster hot gas, is described by King's $\beta$-model, and that both
intra-cluster gas and dark matter are in hydrostatic equilibrium, bound by the
same total mass profile, we derive the mass and density profiles of the BEC

corresponding to isothermal hot gas and zero temperature BEC dark matter,
non-isothermal gas and zero temperature dark matter, and isothermal gas and
finite temperature BEC, respectively. The properties of the finite temperature
BEC dark matter cluster are investigated in detail numerically. We compare our
theoretical results with the observational data of 106 galactic clusters. Using
a least-squares fitting, as well as the observational results for the dark
matter self-interaction cross section, we obtain some upper bounds for the mass

the theoretical point of view. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part
introduces stochastic thermodynamics, the second part aims at transferring the
concepts of stochastic thermodynamics to developed turbulence. / Central in
stochastic thermodynamics are Markov processes. An elementary example is
Brownian motion. In contrast to macroscopic thermodynamics, the work done and
the entropy produced for single trajectories of the Brownian particles are
random quantities. Statistical properties of such fluctuating quantities are
central in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Prominent results are
so-called fluctuation theorems which express the balance between production and
consumption of entropy and generalise the second law. / Turbulent cascades of
eddies are assumed to be the predominant mechanism of turbulence generation and
fix the statistical properties of developed turbulent flows. An intriguing
phenomenon of developed turbulence, known as small-scale intermittency, are
violent small-scale fluctuations in flow velocity that exceed any Gaussian
prediction. / In analogy to Brownian motion, it is demonstrated in the thesis
how the assumption of the Markov property leads to a Markov process for the
turbulent cascade that is equivalent to the seminal K62 model. In addition to
the K62 model, it is demonstrated how many other models of turbulence can be
written as a Markov process, including scaling laws, multiplicative cascades,
multifractal models and field-theoretic approaches. Based on the various Markov
processes, the production of entropy along the cascade and the corresponding
fluctuation theorems is discussed. In particular, experimental data indicates
that entropy consumption is linked to small-scale intermittency, and a
connection between entropy consumption and an inverse cascade is suggestive.

that every Markov process that takes values in a finite partially ordered set
and whose generator can be represented in monotone maps has a pathwise dual
process. In the special setting of attractive spin systems this has been
discovered earlier by Gray.
  We show that the dual simplifies a lot when the state space is a lattice (in
the order-theoretic meaning of the word) and all monotone maps satisfy an
additivity condition. This leads to a unified treatment of several well-known
dualities, including Siegmund's dual for processes with a totally ordered state
space, duality of additive spin systems, and a duality due to Krone for the
two-stage contact process, and allows for the construction of new dualities as
well.
  We show that the well-known representation of additive spin systems in terms
of open paths in a graphical representation can be generalized to additive
Markov processes taking values in general lattices, but for the process and its
dual to be representable on the same underlying space, we need to assume that
the lattice is distributive.
  In the final section, we show how our results can be generalized from finite
state spaces to interacting particle systems with finite local state spaces.

star formation. A very limited amount of X-ray results is available for the
protostellar (ClassI) phase. A systematic search of transient X-ray phenomena
combined with a careful evaluation of the evolutionary stage offer a widely
unexplored window to our understanding of YSOs X-ray properties. Within the
EXTraS project, a search for transients and variability in the whole XMM-Newton
archive, we discover transient X-ray emission consistent with ISO-Oph 85, a
strongly embedded YSO in the rho Ophiuchi region, not detected in previous
time-averaged X-ray studies. We extract an X-ray light curve for the flare and
determine its spectral parameters from XMM-Newton/EPIC (European Photon Imaging
Camera) data using quantile analysis. The X-ray flare ($2500\,s$), the only one
detected in the XMM-Newton archive for ISO-Oph 85, has a luminosity of
$LogL_X[erg/s]=31.1$ and a spectrum consistent with a highly-absorbed
one-component thermal model ($N_H=1.0^{+1.2}_{-0.5}10^{23}\,cm^{-2}$,
$kT=1.15^{+2.35}_{-0.65}\,keV)$. We set an upper limit of $LogL_X[erg/s]<29.5$
to the quiescent X-ray luminosity. We build a SED with IR to mm photometry
drawn from literature and mid-IR Spitzer and sub-mm Herschel photometry
analysed by us, and compare it with pre-computed models. The sub-mm emission
peak in the Herschel data suggests that the object is a ClassI protostar.
However, the Herschel/IR position offset is larger than for other YSOs in the
region, leaving some doubt on the association. This is the first X-ray flare
from a YSO recognised as a candidate ClassI YSO via the analysis of its
complete SED. This work shows how the analysis of the whole SED is fundamental
for the classification of YSOs, and how the X-ray source detection techniques
we developed can open a new era in time-resolved analysis of the X-ray emission
from stars.

the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. The frequency of DO events varied
in time, supposedly because of changes in background climate conditions. Here,
the influence of external forcings on DO events is investigated with
statistical modelling. We assume two types of simple stochastic dynamical
systems models (double-well potential-type and oscillator-type), forced by the
northern hemisphere summer insolation change and/or the global ice volume
change. The model parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood
method with the NGRIP Ca$^{2+}$ record. The stochastic oscillator model with at
least the ice volume forcing reproduces well the sample autocorrelation
function of the record and the frequency changes of warming transitions in the
last glacial period across MISs 2, 3, and 4. The model performance is improved
with the additional insolation forcing. The BIC scores also suggest that the
ice volume forcing is relatively more important than the insolation forcing,
though the strength of evidence depends on the model assumption. Finally, we
simulate the average number of warming transitions in the past four glacial
periods, assuming the model can be extended beyond the last glacial, and
compare the result with an Iberian margin sea-surface temperature (SST) record
(Martrat et al., Science, vol. 317, p. 502, 2007). The simulation result
supports the previous observation that abrupt millennial-scale climate changes
in the penultimate glacial (MIS 6) are less frequent than in the last glacial
(MISs 2-4). On the other hand, it suggests that the number of abrupt
millennial-scale climate changes in older glacial periods (MISs 6, 8, and 10)
might be larger than inferred from the SST record.

self-assembly towards desired architectures. Out of the many different shapes,
helix has a unique position. Helical structures are ubiquitous in nature and a
helical shape is exhibited by the most important biopolymers like
polynucleotides, polypeptides and polysaccharides as well as by cellular
organelles like flagella. Helical particles can self-assemble into chiral
superstructures, which may have a variety of applications, e.g. as photonic
(meta)materials. However,a clear and definite understanding of these structures
has not been entirely achieved yet. We have recently undertaken an extensive
investigation on the phase behaviour of hard helical particles, using numerical
simulations and classical density functional theory. Here we present a detailed
study of the phase diagram of hard helices as a function of their morphology.
This includes a variety of liquid-crystal phases, with different degrees of
orientational and positional ordering. We show how, by tuning the helix
parameters, it is possible to control the organization of the system. Starting
from slender helices, whose phase behaviour is similar to that of rodlike
particles, the increase in curliness leads to the onset of azimuthal
correlations between the particles and the formation of phases specific to
helices. These phases feature a new kind of screw order, of which there is
experimental evidence in colloidal suspensions of helical flagella.

non-circular when projected on the sky. Polarization allows study of such
geometric effects, and X-ray polarimetry is likely to become feasible for a
significant number of sources in the future. Potential targets for future X-ray
polarization observations are the high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), which
consist of a compact object in orbit with an early type star. In this paper ws
show that X-ray polarization from HMXBs has a distinct signature which depends
on the source inclination and orbital phase. The presence of the X-ray source
displaced from the star creates linear polarization even if the primary wind is
spherically symmetric whenever the system is viewed away from conjunction.
Direct X-rays dilute this polarization whenever the X-ray source is not
eclipsed; at mid-eclipse the net polarization is expected to be small or zero
if the wind is circularly symmetric around the line of centers. Resonance line
scattering increases the scattering fraction, often by large factors, over the
energy band spanned by resonance lines. Real winds are not expected to be
spherically symmetric, or circularly symmetric around the line of centers,
owing to the combined effects of the compact object gravity and ionization on
the wind hydrodynamics. A sample calculation shows that this creates
polarization fractions ranging up to tens of percent at mid-eclipse.

exotic decay of the discovered Higgs $(h_{125})$ into two light (hidden) Higgs

the Higgs decay $h_{125}\to WW^*$, $h_{125}\to ZZ^*$ and $h_{125}\to

scalars/pseudoscalars decay of the Higgs is performed in the gluon fusion
channel. The extra hidden Higgs bosons of the enlarged scalar sector, if they
exist, will then decay into lighter fermion paris, i.e., $b\bar{b}$,
$\tau\bar{\tau}$ and $\mu\bar{\mu}$ via the mixing with the doublets. A
detailed simulation using PYTHIA of the $2b+2\tau$, $\geq 3\tau$, $2b+2\mu$ and
$2\tau+2\mu$ final states is presented. From our analysis we conclude that,
depending on the selected benchmark points, such decay modes can be explored

a sequence of two complete measurements, the first one terminating the

expand and contract many times in a system of oscillating branes. In this
model, first, N fundamental strings transit to N M0-anti-M0-branes. Then,
M0-branes join to each other and build an M8-anti-M8 system. This system is
unstable, broken and two anti-M4-branes, a compactified M4-brane, an M3-brane
in additional to one M0-brane are produced. The M3-brane wraps around the
compactified M4-brane and both of them oscillate between two anti-M4-branes.
Our universe is located on the M3-brane and interacts with other branes by
exchanging the M0-brane and some scalars in transverse directions. By wrapping
of M3-brane, universe contracts and generalized uncertainty principle or GUP
emerges. By oscillating the compactified M4-M3-brane and approaching to one of
anti-M4-branes, one end of M3-brane glues to the anti-M4-brane and other end
remains sticking and wrapping around M4-brane. Then, by getting away of the
M4-M3 system, M4 rolls, wrapped M3 opens and expansion epoch of universe
begins. By closing the M4 to anti-M4, the square mass of some scalars become
negative and they make a transition to a tachyonic phase. To remove these
states, M4 rebounds, rolls, M3 wraps around it and universe contracts again. We
show that that the scale factor of universe in this system only at
$t\rightarrow -\infty$ shrinks to zero and thus, the age of our universe is
infinity. Also, when tachyonic states disappear at the beginning of expansion
branch, some extra energy is produced and leads to the inflation. This theory

compressible regime is a difficult task because complex physical effects at the
phase interfaces can govern the global flow behavior. We present a sharp
interface approach which treats the interface as a shock-wave like
discontinuity. Any mixing of fluid phases is avoided by using the flow solver
in the bulk regions only, and a ghost-fluid approach close to the interface.
The coupling states for the numerical solution in the bulk regions are
determined by the solution of local multi-phase Riemann problems across the
interface. The Riemann solution accounts for the relevant physics by enforcing
appropriate jump conditions at the phase boundary. A wide variety of interface
effects can be handled in a thermodynamically consistent way. This includes
surface tension or mass/energy transfer by phase transition. Moreover, the
local normal speed of the interface, which is needed to calculate the time
evolution of the interface, is given by the Riemann solution. The interface
tracking itself is based on a level-set method.
  The focus in this paper is the description of the multi-phase Riemann solver
and its usage within the sharp interface approach. One-dimensional problems are
selected to validate the approach. Finally, the three-dimensional simulation of
a wobbling droplet and a shock droplet interaction in two dimensions are shown.
In both problems phase transition and surface tension determine the global bulk
behavior.

that destroys cancer cells by heat. The heat results from focusing energy in
the radiofrequency spectrum through a needle. Amongst others, this can enable
the treatment of patients who are not eligible for an open surgery. However,
the possibility of recurrent liver cancer due to incomplete ablation of the
tumor makes post-interventional monitoring via regular follow-up scans
mandatory. These scans have to be carefully inspected for any conspicuousness.
Within this study, the RF ablation zones from twelve post-interventional CT
acquisitions have been segmented semi-automatically to support the visual
inspection. An interactive, graph-based contouring approach, which prefers
spherically shaped regions, has been applied. For the quantitative and
qualitative analysis of the algorithm's results, manual slice-by-slice
segmentations produced by clinical experts have been used as the gold standard
(which have also been compared among each other). As evaluation metric for the
statistical validation, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) has been
calculated. The results show that the proposed tool provides lesion
segmentation with sufficient accuracy much faster than manual segmentation. The
visual feedback and interactivity make the proposed tool well suitable for the
clinical workflow.

  Infrastructure Development Processes at the Local Government Level","14 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ghana's Decentralization Policy has made significant contribution in
infrastructural implementation and delivery through Metropolitan, Municipal and
District Assemblies as an alternative development strategy to ensure the
implementation of the overall national agenda. To date, many systems and
strategies have been implemented towards improving development of
infrastructure at the local government level. Given that initiation and
implementation of infrastructural development at the local level involves the
multi-institutional participation of various stakeholders in local governance
for effective monitoring and development, several governance forms including
e-governance have been initiated towards improvement and effective management
of the assemblies. E-Governance through the use of relevant Information and
Communication Technology has been implemented through the Government Policy on
Information and Communications Technology for Accelerated Development as a
catalyst to facilitate the cross-sectoral participation in the implementation
of infrastructural development. Unfortunately, to date, the ICT4AD does not
appear to be successfully on course having been in existence for over a decade.
Similarly, the development and monitoring of the physical infrastructure at the
local level continue to suffer several setbacks and it is currently clearly
evident that a refined system of best practices must be put in place to
simplify and harmonize the entire development process. This paper is aimed at
the assessment of the challenges of e-governance in infrastructural development
at the local government level in Ghana. Using a mixed approach with purposive
sampling, data gathered from the MMDAs in Ashanti Region suggest that the
entire programme has been very slow; bedeviled with lack of funding and
