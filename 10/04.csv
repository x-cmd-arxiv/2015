used to make individualized recommendations. For instance, Medicare's Hospital
Compare webpage provides information to patients about specific hospital
mortality rates for a heart attack or Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).
Hospital Compare's current recommendations are based on a random effects logit
model with a random hospital indicator and patient risk factors. By checking
the out of sample calibration of their individualized predictions against
general empirical advice, we are led to substantial revisions of the Hospital
Compare model for AMI mortality. As opposed to Hospital Compare, our revised
models incorporate information about hospital volume, nursing staff, medical
residents, and the hospital's ability to perform cardiovascular procedures,
information that is clearly needed if a model is to make appropriately
calibrated predictions. Additionally, we contrast several methods for
summarizing a model's predictions for use by the public. We find that indirect
standardization, as currently used by Hospital Compare, fails to adequately
control for differences in patient risk factors, whereas direct standardization
provides good control and is easy to interpret.

restrictive bounds on the change in $\alpha$ over the last 1.8 billion years.
We review the uncertainties in these analyses, focussing on corrections to the
standard estimate of $k_\alpha\!=\!\alpha\,dE_r/d\alpha$ due to Damour and
Dyson. Guided, in part, by the best practice for assessing systematic errors in
theoretical estimates spelt out by Dobaczewski et al. [in J. Phys. G: Nucl.

uncertain to within a factor of 2 or 3, it constitutes at most no more than 25%
of the Damour-Dyson estimate of $k_\alpha$. Making similar allowances for the
uncertainties in the modeling of the operation of the Oklo reactors, we
conclude that the relative change in $\alpha$ since the Oklo reactors were last
active (redshift $z\simeq 0.14$) is less than $\sim 10$ parts per billion. To
illustrate the utility of this bound at low-$z$, we consider its implications

assumed to be identically and independently distributed (iid), which is a poor
assumption from a modeling perspective. It has been experimentally observed
that the performance of BoW and FV representations can be improved by employing
discounting transformations such as power normalization. In this paper, we
introduce non-iid models by treating the model parameters as latent variables

Fisher kernel principle we encode an image by the gradient of the data
log-likelihood w.r.t. the model hyper-parameters. Our models naturally generate
discounting effects in the representations; suggesting that such
transformations have proven successful because they closely correspond to the
representations obtained for non-iid models. To enable tractable computation,
we rely on variational free-energy bounds to learn the hyper-parameters and to

practice could be limited since they typically rely on computationally
intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms for their implementation. One

terms of computational convenience as opposed to a true distance measure

moderately high temporal sampling in the CEVS were analyzed. The selection of
QSO candidates was based on the study of intrinsic optical photometric
variability of 14,719 light curves. We studied samples defined by cuts in the
variability index (Vindex $>$ 66.5), periodicity index (Q $>$ 2), and the
distribution of these sources in the plane (AT , ${\gamma}$), using a slight
modification of the first-order of the structure function for the temporal
sampling of the survey. Finally, 288 sources were selected as QSO candidates.
The results shown in this work are a first attempt to develop a robust method
to detect QSO towards the Galactic plane in the era of massive surveys such as
VISTA and Gaia.

conditions can reduce delays caused by congestion. At a 2-to-1 lane reduction,
the improvement in flow past a bottleneck due to traffic with a random mixture
of 40% connected vehicles is found to be 52%. Control is based on
connected-vehicle-reported velocities near the bottleneck. In response to
indications of congestion the connected vehicles, which are also adaptive
cruise control vehicles, reduce their speed in slowdown regions. Early lane
changes of manually driven vehicles from the terminated lane to the continuous
lane are induced by the slowing connected vehicles. Self-organized congestion
at the bottleneck is thus delayed or eliminated, depending upon the incoming
flow magnitude. For the large majority of vehicles, travel times past the
bottleneck are substantially reduced. Control is responsible for delaying the
onset of congestion as the incoming flow increases. Adaptive cruise control
increases the flow out of the congested state at the bottleneck. The nature of
the congested state, when it occurs, appears to be similar under a variety of
conditions. Typically 80-100 vehicles are approximately equally distributed
between the lanes in the 500-m region prior to the end of the terminated lane.
Without the adaptive cruise control capability, connected vehicles can delay
the onset of congestion but do not increase the asymptotic flow past the
bottleneck. Calculations are done using the Kerner-Klenov stochastic
discrete-time model for manual vehicles. The dynamics of the connected vehicles
is given by a conventional adaptive cruise control algorithm plus commanded
deceleration. Because time in the model for manual vehicles is discrete
(one-second intervals), it is assumed that the acceleration of any vehicle
immediately in front of a connected vehicle is constant during the time
interval.

by one of their ends to the colloids, at a fixed colloidal concentration, and
carry out numerical simulations at increasing concentrations of polymer chains,

by turbulent flow, is ubiquitous in environmental and industrial applications.
The process is a sequence of events that start with an incipient motion of the
particle being dislodged from its place, continue as sliding or rolling on the
surface, ending with the particle being detached from the surface and lifted up
into the flow. In this study the focus is on the resuspension of solid
spherical particles with the density comparable to that of the fluid and the
diameter comparable with the Kolmogorov length scale. We track their motion
during the lift-off events in an oscillating grid turbulent flow. We measure
simultaneously the Lagrangian trajectories of both the particles freely moving
along the bottom smooth wall and the surrounding flow tracers. Different force
terms acting on particles were estimated based on particle motion and local
flow parameters. The results show that: \emph{i}) the lift force is dominant;
\emph{ii}) drag force on freely moving particles is less relevant in this type
of resuspension; \emph{iii}) the Basset (history or viscous-unsteady) force is
a non-negligible component and plays an important role before the lift-off
event. Although we cannot estimate very accurately the magnitude of the force
terms, we find that during the resuspension they are within the range of
$2\div10$ times the buoyancy force magnitude. The findings cannot be
extrapolated to particles, which are much smaller than the Kolmogorov length
scale, or much denser than the fluid. Nevertheless, the present findings can
assist in modeling of the sediment transport, particle filtration, pneumatic
conveying and mixing in bio-reactors.

that describe the evolution of the tropical atmosphere on planetary
(10,000-40,000 km) spatial scales. The nonlinear traveling waves come in four
types, corresponding to the four types of linear wave solutions, one of which
has the properties of the MJO. In the MJO traveling wave, the convective
activity has a pulse-like shape, with a narrow region of enhanced convection
and a wide region of suppressed convection. Furthermore, an amplitude-dependent
dispersion relation is derived, and it shows that the nonlinear MJO has a lower
frequency and slower propagation speed than the linear MJO. By taking the
small-amplitude limit, an analytic formula is also derived for the dispersion
relation of linear waves. To derive all of these results, a key aspect is the
model's conservation of energy, which holds even in the presence of forcing. In
the limit of weak forcing, it is shown that the nonlinear traveling waves have

involving the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). The model combines (i) the
tropical dynamics of the MJO and equatorial baroclinic waves and (ii) the
dynamics of barotropic Rossby waves with significant extratropical structure,
and the combined system has a conserved energy. The method of multiscale
asymptotics is applied to systematically derive a system of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) for three-wave resonant interactions. Two novel
features are (i) a degenerate auxiliary problem with overdetermined equations
due to a compatibility condition (meridional geostrophic balance) and (ii)
cubic self-interaction terms that are not typically found in three-wave
resonance ODEs. Several examples illustrate applications to MJO initiation and
termination, including cases of (i) the MJO, equatorial baroclinic Rossby
waves, and barotropic Rossby waves interacting, and (ii) the MJO, baroclinic
Kelvin waves, and barotropic Rossby waves interacting. Resonance with the
Kelvin wave is not possible here if only dry variables are considered, but it
occurs in the moist model here through interactions with water vapor and
convective activity.

investigated by Sankappanavar ([7]) as a generalization of De Morgan algebras.
Also, in [7], several new subvarieties of $\mathbf{I}$ were introduced,
including the subvariety $\mathbf{I_{2,0}}$, defined by the identity: $x""
\approx x$, which plays a crucial role in this paper. Several more new
subvarieties of $\mathbf{I}$, including the subvariety $\mathbf{SL}$ of
semilattices with a least element $0$, are studied in [3], and an explicit
description of semisimple subvarieties of $\mathbf{I}$ is given in [5].
  It is well known that the operation $\land$ induces a partial order
($\sqsubseteq$) in the variety $\mathbf{SL}$ and also in the variety
$\mathbf{DM}$ of De Morgan algebras. As both $\mathbf{SL}$ and $\mathbf{DM}$
are subvarieties of $\mathbf{I}$ and the definition of partial order can be
expressed in terms of the implication and the constant, it is but natural to
ask whether the relation $\sqsubseteq$ (now defined) on $\mathbf{I}$ is
actually a partial order in some (larger) subvariety of $\mathbf{I}$ that
includes $\mathbf{SL}$ and $\mathbf{DM}$.
  The purpose of the present paper is two-fold: Firstly, a complete answer is
given to the above mentioned problem. Indeed, our first main theorem shows that
the variety $\mathbf{I_{2,0}}$ is a maximal subvariety of $\mathbf{I}$ with
respect to the property that the relation $\sqsubseteq$ is a partial order on
its members. In view of this result, one is then naturally led to consider the
problem of determining the number of non-isomorphic algebras in
$\mathbf{I_{2,0}}$ that can be defined on an $n$-element chain (herein called
$\mathbf{I_{2,0}}$-chains), $n$ being a natural number. Secondly, we answer
this problem in our second main theorem, which says that, for each $n \in
\mathbb{N}$, there are exactly $n$ nonisomorphic $\mathbf{I_{2,0}}$-chains of
size $n$.

balance gravity and the cluster contracts. If WIMPs are collisionless and
bosonic, the cluster collapses directly to form a mini-black hole. For
fermionic WIMPs, the cluster contracts until it is sustained by Fermi pressure,
forming a small compact object. If the fermionic WIMP mass is smaller than
$4\times 10^2$ GeV, the radius of the compact object is larger than its

magnetoresistance can also emerge in junctions composed of ferromagnets and
time-reversal invariant topological superconductors without spin-rotation
symmetry. Here the physical origin is that when the spin-polarization direction
of injected electron from the ferromagnet lying in the same plane of the
spin-polarization direction of Majorana zero modes, the electron will undergo a
perfect spin-equal Andreev reflection, while injected electrons with other
spin-polarization direction will be partially Andreev reflected and partially
normal reflected, which consequently have a lower conductance, and therefore,
the magnetoresistance effect emerges. Compared to conventional magnetic tunnel
junctions, an unprecedented advantage of the junctions studied here is that
arbitrary high tunneling magnetoresistance can be obtained even the
magnetization of the ferromagnets are weak and the insulating tunneling
barriers are featureless. Our findings provide a new fascinating mechanism to
obtain high tunneling magnetoresistance.

complex systems, a perspective has arisen proposing that many properties of
cities are quantitatively predictable due to agglomeration or scaling effects.
Using new harmonized definitions for functional urban areas, we examine to what
extent these ideas apply to European cities. We show that while most large
urban systems in Western Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK)
approximately agree with theoretical expectations, the small number of cities
in each nation and their natural variability preclude drawing strong
conclusions. We demonstrate how this problem can be overcome so that cities
from different urban systems can be pooled together to construct larger
datasets. This leads to a simple statistical procedure to identify urban
scaling relations, which then clearly emerge as a property of European cities.
We compare the predictions of urban scaling to Zipf's law for the size
distribution of cities and show that while the former holds well the latter is
a poor descriptor of European cities. We conclude with scenarios for the size
and properties of future pan-European megacities and their implications for the
economic productivity, technological sophistication and regional inequalities
of an integrated European urban system.

canonical family of surfaces approaching $p$ along its future null cone and
evaluate the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. The evaluation relies on
solving an ""optimal embedding equation"" whose solutions represent critical
points of the quasi-local energy. For a spacetime with matter fields, the
scenario is similar to that of the large sphere limit found in [7]. Namely,
there is a natural solution which is a local minimum, and the limit of its
quasi-local energy recovers the stress-energy tensor at $p$. For a vacuum
spacetime, the quasi-local energy vanishes to higher order and the solution of
the optimal embedding equation is more complicated. Nevertheless, we are able
to show that there exists a solution which is a local minimum and that the
limit of its quasi-local energy is related to the Bel-Robinson tensor. Together
with earlier work [7], this completes the consistency verification of the
Wang-Yau quasi-local energy with all classical limits.

during the first 73 months of solar cycles 23 and 24 in order to understand the
weak geomagnetic activity in cycle 24. We find that the number of MCs did not
decline in cycle 24, although the average sunspot number is known to have
declined by ~40%. Despite the large number of MCs, their geoeffectiveness in
cycle 24 was very low. The average Dst index in the sheath and cloud portions
in cycle 24 was -33 nT and -23 nT, compared to -66 nT and -55 nT, respectively
in cycle 23. One of the key outcomes of this investigation is that the
reduction in the strength of geomagnetic storms as measured by the Dst index is
a direct consequence of the reduction in the factor VBz (the product of the MC
speed and the out-of-the-ecliptic component of the MC magnetic field). The
reduction in MC-to-ambient total pressure in cycle 24 is compensated for by the
reduction in the mean MC speed, resulting in the constancy of the dimensionless
expansion rate at 1 AU. However, the MC size in cycle 24 was significantly
smaller, which can be traced to the anomalous expansion of coronal mass
ejections near the Sun reported by Gopalswamy et al. (2014a). One of the
consequences of the anomalous expansion seems to be the larger heliocentric
distance where the pressure balance between the CME flux ropes and the ambient
medium occurs in cycle 24.

long-sought objective in layered systems beyond graphene. Recently, layered
pentatelluride ZrTe5 was found to host signatures of Dirac semimetal. However,
the low Fermi level in ZrTe5 strongly hinders a comprehensive understanding of
the whole picture of electronic states through photoemission measurements,
especially in the conduction band. Here, we report the observation of Dirac
fermions in ZrTe5 through magneto-optics and magneto-transport. By applying
magnetic field, we observe a square-root-B dependence of inter-Landau-level
resonance and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with non-trivial Berry
phase, both of which are hallmarks of Dirac fermions. The angular-dependent SdH
oscillations show a clear quasi-two-dimensional feature with highly anisotropic
Fermi surface and band topology, in stark contrast to the 3D Dirac semimetal
such as Cd3As2. This is further confirmed by the angle-dependent Berry phase
measurements and the observation of bulk quantum Hall plateaus. The unique band
dispersion is theoretically understood: the system is at the critical point
between a 3D Dirac semimetal and a topological insulator phase. With the
confined interlayer dispersion and reducible dimensionality, our work
establishes ZrTe5 as an ideal platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena
of Dirac fermions.

have been shown to be successful for playing the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma
(IPD), a paradigmatic problem for studying the evolution of cooperation among
non-kin individuals. However it is an open question whether such reciprocal
strategies can emerge as the rational outcome of repeated interactions between
selfish agents. Here we show that adopting a co-action perspective, which takes
into account the symmetry between agents - a relevant consideration in
biological and social contexts - naturally leads to such a strategy. For a
2-player IPD, we show that the co-action solution corresponds to the Pavlov
strategy, thereby providing a rational basis for it. For an IPD involving many
players, an instance of the Public Goods game where cooperation is generally
considered to be harder to achieve, we show that the cooperators always
outnumber defectors in the co-action equilibrium. This can be seen as a
generalization of Pavlov to contests involving many players. In general,
repeated interactions allow rational agents to become aware of the inherent
symmetry of their situation, enabling them to achieve robust cooperation
through co-action strategies - which, in the case of IPD, is a reciprocal
Pavlovian one.

representations from two consecutive convolutional layers: one layer is
utilized for local feature extraction and the other serves as guidance to pool
the extracted features. By taking different viewpoints of convolutional layers,
we further develop two schemes to realize this idea. The first one directly
uses convolutional layers from a DCNN. The second one applies the pretrained
CNN on densely sampled image regions and treats the fully-connected activations
of each image region as convolutional feature activations. We then train
another convolutional layer on top of that as the pooling-guidance

possess more integrals of motion than degrees of freedom. They have many
attractive properties, wide applications in modern physics and connection to
many domains in pure and applied mathematics. We overview two new families of
superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb systems with non-central terms and
superintegrable Hamiltonians with double singular oscillators of type $(n,N-n)$
in $N$-dimensional Euclidean space. We present their quadratic and polynomial
algebras involving Casimir operators of $so(N+1)$ Lie algebras that exhibit
very interesting decompositions $Q(3)\oplus so(N-1)$, $Q(3)\oplus so(n)\oplus
so(N-n)$ and the cubic Casimir operators. The realization of these algebras in
terms of deformed oscillator enables the determination of a finite dimensional
unitary representation. We present algebraic derivations of the degenerate
energy spectra of these systems and relate them with the physical spectra
obtained from the separation of variables.

finite temperatures both the quantum and thermal fluctuations contribute. For a

the strongest received signal and the well known anomaly of the MAC protocol

performance. Our goal is to propose an alternative game-theoretic approach for
association. We model the joint resource allocation and user association as a
matching game with complementarities and peer effects consisting of selfish
players solely interested in their individual throughputs. Using recent
game-theoretic results we first show that various resource sharing protocols
actually fall in the scope of the set of stability-inducing resource allocation
schemes. The game makes an extensive use of the Nash bargaining and some of its
related properties that allow to control the incentives of the players. We show
that the proposed mechanism can greatly improve the efficiency of 802.11 with
heterogeneous nodes and reduce the negative impact of peer effects such as its
MAC anomaly. The mechanism can be implemented as a virtual connectivity
management layer to achieve efficient APs-user associations without
modification of the MAC layer.

enlightening series of new results focusing mostly on the so-called mean and
global first passage time (MFPT and GFPT, respectively) of such processes. Here
we push the understanding of first passage processes a step further. For a
simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of
first passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT
significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time
behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is
shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value
to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third
characteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief
excursion away from the target.

motivates the consideration of tractable approximations to the likelihood
function, such as the pseudolikelihood function, which offers an approach to
constructing such an approximation. Naive implementation of what we term a
pseudo-posterior resulting from replacing the likelihood function in the

target posterior distribution and discuss the computational and statistical
efficiency that result from this approach. We illustrate our methodology

has recently been synthesized. Here we investigate the strain effects on the
properties of this new material by first-principles calculations. We show that
the material is quite soft with a small stiffness constant and can sustain
large strains $\geq 12\%$. It remains a direct gap semiconductor under strain
and the bandgap size can be tuned in a wide range as large as 1 eV.
Interestingly, for biaxial strain, a band crossing effect occurs at the valence
band maximum close to a 8\% strain, leading to a dramatic increase of the hole
effective mass. Strong optical absorption can be achieved by strain tuning with
absorption coefficient $\sim10^6$ cm$^{-1}$ covering a wide spectrum. Our
findings suggest the great potential of strain-engineered C$_2$N-$h$2D in
electronic and optoelectronic device applications.

  time-projection chamber",,,"10.1016/j.nima.2016.01.030",,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A first experimental test of tracking relativistic charged particles by
`drifting' Cherenkov photons in a water-based optical time-projection chamber
(OTPC) has been performed at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The prototype
OTPC detector consists of a 77~cm long, 28~cm diameter, 40~kg cylindrical water
mass instrumented with a combination of commercial $5.1\times5.1$~cm$^2$
micro-channel plate photo-multipliers (MCP-PMT) and $6.7\times6.7$~cm$^2$
mirrors. Five MCP-PMTs are installed in two columns along the OTPC cylinder in
a small-angle stereo configuration. A mirror is mounted opposite each MCP-PMT
on the far side of the detector cylinder, effectively doubling the
photo-detection efficiency and providing a time-resolved image of the Cherenkov
light on the opposing wall. Each MCP-PMT is coupled to an anode readout
consisting of thirty 50 Ohm microstrips. A 180-channel data acquisition system
digitizes the MCP-PMT signals on one end of the microstrips using the PSEC4
waveform sampling-and-digitizing chip operating at a sampling rate of
10.24~Gigasamples-per-second. The single-ended microstrip readout determines
the time and position of a photon arrival at the face of the MCP-PMT by
recording both the direct signal and the pulse reflected from the unterminated
far end of the strip. The detector was installed on the Fermilab MCenter
secondary beam-line behind a steel absorber where the primary flux is multi-GeV
muons. Approximately 80 Cherenkov photons are detected for a through-going muon
track in a total event duration of ~2 ns. By measuring the time-of-arrival and
the position of individual photons at the surface of the detector to
$\le$100~ps and a few mm, respectively, we have measured a spatial resolution
of $\sim$ 15~mm for each MCP-PMT track segment, and, from linear fits over the
entire track length of $\sim40$~cm, an angular resolution on the track
direction of $\sim60$~mrad.

  hyperexcitability using a new neuro-glial mass model","22 pages, 11 figures, article preprint",,,,"q-bio.NC math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The investigation of the neuronal environment allows us to better understand
the activity of a cerebral region as a whole. The recent experimental evidences
of the presence of transporters for glutamate and GABA in both neuronal and
astrocyte compartments raise the question of the functional importance of the
astrocytes in the regulation of the neuronal activity. We propose a new
computational model at the mesoscopic scale embedding the recent knowledge on
the physiology of neuron and astrocyte coupled activities. The neural
compartment is a neural mass model with double excitatory feedback, and the
glial compartment focus on the dynamics of glutamate and GABA concentrations.
Using the proposed model, we first study the impact of a deficiency in the
reuptake of GABA by astrocytes, which implies an increase in GABA concentration
in the extracellular space. A decrease in the frequency of neural activity is
observed and explained from the dynamics analysis. Second, we investigate the
neuronal response to a deficiency in the reuptake of Glutamate by the
astrocytes. In this case, we identify three behaviors : the neural activity may
either be reduced, or enhanced or, alternatively, may experience a transient of
high activity before stabilizing around a new activity regime with a frequency
close to the nominal one. After translating theoretically the neuronal
excitability modulation using the bifurcation structure of the neural mass
model, we state the conditions on the glial feedback parameters corresponding
to each behavior.

  stellar evolutions","57 pages including 5 tables and 14 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper the neutrino emission processes being supposed to be the main
sources of energy loss in the stellar core in the later stages of stellar
evolution are reviewed. All the calculations are carried out in the framework
of electro-weak theory based on the Standard Model. It is considered that the
neutrino has a little mass, which is very much consistent with the
phenomenological evidences and presupposes a minimal extension of the Standard
Model. All three neutrinos (i.e., electron neutrino, muon neutrino and tau
neutrino) are taken into account in the calculations. It is evident that the
strong magnetic field, present in the degenerate stellar objects such as
neutron stars, has remarkable influence on some neutrino emission processes.
The intensity of such magnetic field is very close to the critical value
($H_{c}=4.414\times 10^{13}$ G) and sometimes exceeds it. In this paper the
region of dominance of different neutrino emission processes in absence of
magnetic field is picturized. The region of importance of the neutrino emission
processes in presence of a strong magnetic field is indicated by a picture. The
study reveals the significant contributions of some neutrino emission
processes, both in absence and in presence of a strong magnetic field in the
later stages of stellar evolution.

the central nervous system, paving the way for holistic theories that improve

play in the understanding of brain signals, namely, continuous mapping of the
signals onto a hyper-sphere, a 4-dimensional space equipped with a
doughnut-like shape that is not detected by observers living in a 3-dimensional
world. We evaluate the features of the imperceptible 4th dimension based on
resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging series. In particular, we
looked for simultaneous activation of antipodal signals on the surface of a
cortical hyper-sphere. In this article, we demonstrate that spontaneous brain
activity displays the typical features which reveal the existence of a
functional hyper-sphere. The suggestion here is that the brain is embedded in a
hyper-sphere, which helps solve long-standing mysteries concerning our
psychological activities such mind-wandering and memory retrieval or the
ability to connect, pasts and future events.
