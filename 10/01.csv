the nature and physical properties of their energy sources are far from
understood. Very important clues, however, can be inferred by studying the
afterglows of these events. We present optical and X-ray observations of GRB
130831A obtained by Swift, Chandra, Skynet, RATIR, Maidanak, ISON, NOT, LT and
GTC. This burst shows a steep drop in the X-ray light-curve at $\simeq 10^5$ s
after the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\alpha \sim 6$. Such a rare
behaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (FS) model and
indicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of
""internal origin"", produced by a dissipation process within an
ultrarelativistic outflow. We propose that the source of such an outflow, which
must produce the X-ray flux for $\simeq 1$ day in the cosmological rest frame,
is a newly born magnetar or black hole. After the drop, the faint X-ray
afterglow continues with a much shallower decay. The optical emission, on the
other hand, shows no break across the X-ray steep decrease, and the late-time
decays of both the X-ray and optical are consistent. Using both the X-ray and
optical data, we show that the emission after $\simeq 10^5$ s can be explained
well by the FS model. We model our data to derive the kinetic energy of the
ejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a GRB with
emission of internal origin visible for a long time. Furthermore, we break down
the energy budget of this GRB into the prompt emission, the late internal
dissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it with
the energy of the associated supernova, SN 2013fu.

relieve cellular network congestion is to offload users' traffic to small-cell
networks. In this paper, we investigate how the mobile users (MUs) can
effectively offload traffic by taking advantage of the capability of
dual-connectivity, which enables an MU to simultaneously communicate with a
macro base station (BS) and a small-cell access point (AP) via two
radio-interfaces. Offloading traffic to the AP usually reduces the MUs' mobile
data cost, but often at the expense of suffering increased interferences from
other MUs at the same AP. We thus formulate an optimization problem that
jointly determines each MU's traffic schedule (between the BS and AP) and power
control (between two radio-interfaces). The system objective is to minimize all
MUs' total cost, while satisfying each MU's transmit-power constraints through
proper interference control. In spite of the non-convexity of the problem, we
design both a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm to solve the
joint optimization problem. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms
can achieve the close-to-optimum results comparing with the ones achieved by
the LINGO (a commercial optimization software), but with significantly less
computational complexity. The results also show that the proposed adaptive
offloading can significantly reduce the MUs' cost, i.e., save more than 75% of
the cost without offloading traffic and 65% of the cost with a fixed
offloading.

neighboring abundances to be similar based on their pixel similarity and (ii) a

partial threshold voltage recovery can be achieved which will alleviate the

differentiability and strong convexity assumptions, we show linear convergence
for a sufficiently small constant stepsize. This result also applies to
distributed asynchronous variants of the method, involving bounded
interprocessor communication delays.
  We then consider dual versions of incremental proximal algorithms, which are
incremental augmented Lagrangian methods for separable equality-constrained
optimization problems. Contrary to the standard augmented Lagrangian method,
these methods admit decomposition in the minimization of the augmented
Lagrangian, and update the multipliers far more frequently. Our incremental
aggregated augmented Lagrangian methods bear similarity to several known
decomposition algorithms, including the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and more recent variations. We compare these methods in
terms of their properties, and highlight their potential advantages and
limitations.
  We also address the solution of separable inequality-constrained optimization
problems through the use of nonquadratic augmented Lagrangiias such as the
exponential, and we dually consider a corresponding incremental aggregated
version of the proximal algorithm that uses nonquadratic regularization, such
as an entropy function. We finally propose a closely related linearly
convergent method for minimization of large differentiable sums subject to an
orthant constraint, which may be viewed as an incremental aggregated version of
the mirror descent method.

events are associated with both flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and
those with larger $\alpha$ are associated with smaller flares, slower and
narrower CMEs, and lower SEP event fluences. The narrow equilibrium temperature
range required to fit the observed A/Q enhancements is 2.5--3.2 MK, far below
the characteristic flare temperatures of $>$ 10 MK. Only a small number of SEP
events slightly outside this temperature range were found in an expanded search
of impulsive Fe-rich events. Event characteristics are similar for events
isolated in time and those occurring in clusters. The current challenge is to
determine the solar sources of the Fe-rich events. Ambient coronal regions in
the 2.5--3.2 MK range are broadly distributed both in and outside active

accuracy in time results from 1) An application of the backward differentiation
formulae time-stepping algorithm (BDF) in conjunction with 2) A BDF-like
extrapolation technique for certain components of the nonlinear terms (which
makes use of nonlinear solves unnecessary), as well as 3) A novel application
of the Douglas-Gunn splitting (which greatly facilitates handling of boundary
conditions while preserving higher-order accuracy in time). As suggested by our
theoretical analysis of the algorithms for a variety of special cases, an
extensive set of numerical experiments clearly indicate that all of the
BDF-based ADI algorithms proposed in this paper are ""quasi-unconditionally
stable"" in the following sense: each algorithm is stable for all couples
$(h,\Delta t)$ of spatial and temporal mesh sizes in a problem-dependent
rectangular neighborhood of the form $(0,M_h)\times (0,M_t)$. In other words,
for each fixed value of $\Delta t$ below a certain threshold, the Navier-Stokes
solvers presented in this paper are stable for arbitrarily small spatial
mesh-sizes. The second order formulation has further been rigorously shown to
be unconditionally stable for linear hyperbolic and parabolic equations in
two-dimensional space. Although implicit ADI solvers for the Navier-Stokes
equations with nominal second-order of temporal accuracy have been proposed in
the past, the algorithms presented in this paper are the first ADI-based
Navier-Stokes solvers for which second order or better accuracy has been
verified in practice under non-trivial (non-periodic) boundary conditions.

Bogoliubov amplitudes, and dynamic structure factors. This method can be
applied to any homogeneous, two-component system with linear coupling, and
direct, momentum-dependent interactions. The properties of the mean-field
ground state, including polarization and stability, are investigated, and we
identify three distinct instabilities: a density-wave rotonization that occurs
when the gas is fully polarized, a spin-wave rotonization that occurs near zero
polarization, and a mixed instability at intermediate fields. These
instabilities are clarified by means of the real-space density-density
correlation functions, which characterize the spontaneous fluctuations of the
ground state, and the momentum-space structure factors, which characterize the
response of the system to external perturbations. We find that the gas is
susceptible to both density-wave and spin-wave response in the polarized limit
but only a spin-wave response in the zero-polarization limit. These results are
relevant for experiments with rigid rotor molecules such as RbCs,
$\Lambda$-doublet molecules such as ThO that have an anomalously small
zero-field splitting, and doublet-$\Sigma$ molecules such as SrF where two
low-lying opposite-parity states can be tuned to zero splitting by an external

interactions, that is, knowledge about the deepest aspects of matter, is
certainly high if not top on the priority list, not only for physicists and
philosophers. The goal of the present book is to contribute to this knowledge
by going beyond the usual presentations of quantum field theory in physics
textbooks, both in mathematical approach and by critical reflections inspired
by epistemology, that is, by the branch of philosophy also referred to as the
theory of knowledge.
  Hopefully, the present book motivates physicists to appreciate philosophical
ideas. Epistemology and the philosophy of the evolution of science often seem
to lag behind science and to describe the developments a posteriori. As
philosophy here has a profound influence on the actual shaping of an image of
fundamental particles and their interactions, our development should stimulate
the curiosity and imagination of physicists.
  This book can be used as a textbook on quantum field theory for students of
physics or as a monograph for philosophers and physicists interested in the
epistemological foundations of particle physics. The benefits of an approach
resting on philosophical foundations is twofold: the reader is stimulated to
critical thinking and the entire story flows very naturally, thus removing all
the mysteries from quantum field theory.

Recurrence quantification analysis utilizing recurrence plots may extract such

optimal selection of distance thresholds for estimating the recurrence

model for the recurrent dynamics that allows to derive analytically a criterion

utility function which assumes a local maximum for that threshold reflecting
the optimal estimate of the system's recurrence structure. We validate our
approach by means of the nonlinear Lorenz system and its linearized stochastic

isospin-dependent parameters characterizing the SRC (short-range
correlation)-modified single-nucleon momentum distribution in neutron-rich
nucleonic matter using both experimental data and microscopic model
calculations. Using the constrained single-nucleon momentum distribution in a
nonlinear relativistic mean field (RMF) model, we study the equation of state
(EOS) of asymmetric nucleonic matter (ANM), especially the density dependence
of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$. Firstly, as a test of the
model, the average nucleon kinetic energy extracted recently from
electron-nucleus scattering experiments using a neutron-proton dominance model
is well reproduced by the RMF model incorporating effects of the SRC-induced
high momentum nucleons, while it is significantly under predicted by the RMF
model using a step function for the single-nucleon momentum distribution as in
free Fermi gas (FFG) models. Secondly, the kinetic symmetry energy of
quasi-nucleons is found to be
$E^{\rm{kin}}_{\rm{sym}}(\rho_0)=-16.94\pm13.66\,\rm{MeV}$ which is
dramatically different from the prediction of
$E^{\rm{kin}}_{\rm{sym}}(\rho_0)\approx 12.5$ MeV by FFG models at nuclear
matter saturation density $\rho_0=0.16\,\rm{fm}^{-3}$. Thirdly, comparing the
RMF calculations with and without the high momentum nucleons using two sets of
model parameters both reproducing identically all empirically constraints on
the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and the symmetry energy of ANM at
$\rho_0$, the SRC-modified single-nucleon momentum distribution is found to
make the $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ more concave around $\rho_0$ by softening it
significantly at both sub-saturation and supra-saturation densities, leading to
an isospin-dependent incompressibility of ANM in better agreement with existing
experimental data.

interest in recent years. The effects of spatial embedding on the networks'

studying their macroscopic properties. Here, we propose a hierarchy of null
models to generate random surrogates from a given spatially embedded network
that can preserve global and local statistics associated with the nodes'
embedding in a metric space. Comparing the original network's and the resulting
surrogates' global characteristics allows to quantify to what extent these
characteristics are already predetermined by the spatial embedding of the nodes
and links. We apply our framework to various real-world spatial networks and
show that the proposed models capture macroscopic properties of the networks
under study much better than standard random network models that do not account
for the nodes' spatial embedding. Depending on the actual performance of the
proposed null models, the networks are categorized into different classes.
Since many real-world complex networks are in fact spatial networks, the
proposed approach is relevant for disentangling underlying complex system
structure from spatial embedding of nodes in many fields, ranging from social
systems over infrastructure and neurophysiology to climatology.

on accurate reconstruction in controlled environments, where the cameras are
fixed and calibrated and background is known. These approaches are not robust
for general dynamic scenes captured with sparse moving cameras. Previous
approaches for outdoor dynamic scene reconstruction assume prior knowledge of
the static background appearance and structure. The primary contributions of
this paper are twofold: an automatic method for initial coarse dynamic scene
segmentation and reconstruction without prior knowledge of background
appearance or structure; and a general robust approach for joint segmentation
refinement and dense reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple
wide-baseline static or moving cameras. Evaluation is performed on a variety of
indoor and outdoor scenes with cluttered backgrounds and multiple dynamic
non-rigid objects such as people. Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrates improved accuracy in both multiple view segmentation and dense
reconstruction. The proposed approach also eliminates the requirement for prior

for Haar uniformly simulated arbitrary two-qubit states, we find that the

Hamiltonians, namely, the XY model in a transverse field, and the XXZ model, we
show that entanglement as well as information theoretic measures violate the

using a violation parameter, and demonstrate that the violation parameter can
signal quantum phase transitions occurring in these models. We also comment on
the universality of the statistics of first significant digits corresponding to
appropriate measures of quantum correlations in the case of multipartite

transition with increasing temperature is a feature of every pure SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory with N greater than or equal to 3, the regime considered in
this paper is also expected to exhibit a first order deconfinement phase
transition with increasing temperature. However, the low energy constants(LEC)
of this pure Yang-Mills theory have not been calculated till date. We calculate
the LEC s for this effective theory which in turn enables us to calculate the
critical temperature of the deconfinement transition as a function of the

broadband survey of Sgr B2(N). Thirty very favorable rotational lines (K$_a$ =
0 and K$_a$ = 1 only; E$_u$ < 60 K) originating in five consecutive transitions
(J = 8 $\rightarrow$ 7, 9 $\rightarrow$ 8, 10 $\rightarrow$ 9, 11 $\rightarrow$
10, and 12 $\rightarrow$ 11) in both the A and E internal rotation species are
present in this frequency range. Emission was observed at all of the predicted
frequencies, with seventeen lines appearing as distinct, uncontaminated
spectral features, clearly showing the classic a-type, asymmetric top pattern,
with T$_R$* ~ 20-70 mK. The CH$_3$NCO spectra also appear to exhibit two
velocities components near V$_{LSR}$ ~ 62 and 73 km s$^{-1}$, both with
$\Delta$V$_{1/2}$ ~ 10 km s$^{-1}$ - typical of molecules such as CH$_2$CHCN,
HNCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ in Sgr B2(N). The column density of CH$_3$NCO in Sgr B2(N)
was determined to be N$_{tot}$ ~ 2.3 x 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 1.5 x 10$^{13}$
cm$^{-2}$ for the 62 and 73 km s$^{-1}$ components, corresponding to fractional
abundances, relative to H$_2$, of f ~ 7.6 x 10$^{-12}$ and 5.0 x 10$^{-12}$,
respectively. CH$_3$NCO was recently detected in volatized material from comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by Rosetta's Philae lander, with an abundance ~1.3%
of water; in Sgr B2(N), CH$_3$NCO is roughly ~0.04% of the H$_2$O abundance.

non-negative low rank factors $W$ and $H$, for the given input matrix $A$, such

domains such as topic modeling in text mining, background separation in video

the data mining community, there is a lack of efficient parallel software to
solve the problem for big datasets. Existing distributed-memory algorithms are

factorization by iteratively solving alternating non-negative least squares

high-performance parallel algorithm for NMF. It maintains the data and factor

(under mild assumptions). As opposed to previous implementations, our algorithm
is also flexible: (1) it performs well for dense and sparse matrices, and (2)
it allows the user to choose from among multiple algorithms for solving local
NLS subproblems within the alternating iterations. We demonstrate the
scalability of our algorithm and compare it with baseline implementations,

that such objects are (quantum) black holes behaves similarly to the
probability in the $(3+1)$ framework for $D> 3$. In fact, for $D\ge 3$, the
probability increases towards unity as the mass grows above the relevant
$D$-dimensional Planck scale $m_D$. At fixed mass, however, $P_{\rm BH}$
decreases with increasing $D$, so that a particle with mass $m\simeq m_D$ has
just about $10\%$ probability to be a black hole in $D=5$, and smaller for
larger $D$. This result has a potentially strong impact on estimates of black
hole production in colliders. In contrast, for $D=1$, we find the probability
is comparably larger for smaller masses, but $P_{\rm BH} < 0.5$, suggesting
that such lower dimensional black holes are purely quantum and not classical
objects. This result is consistent with recent observations that sub-Planckian
black holes are governed by an effective two-dimensional gravitation theory.
Lastly, we derive Generalised Uncertainty Principle relations for the black
holes under consideration, and find a minimum length corresponding to a
characteristic energy scale of the order of the fundamental gravitational mass
$m_D$ in $D>3$. For $D=1$ we instead find the uncertainty due to the horizon
fluctuations has the same form as the usual Heisenberg contribution, and
therefore no fundamental scale exists.

these channels correspond to completely positive trace-preserving maps defined
by the Hadamard product of the initial density matrix with a time-dependent
matrix which carries the knowledge about the evolution. Physically, there is a
strong motivation for considering this kind of evolution because such channels
appear naturally in the theory of open quantum systems. The main idea behind a
dynamic approach to quantum tomography claims that by performing the same kind
of measurement at some time instants one can obtain new data for state
reconstruction. Thus, this approach leads to a decrease in the number of
distinct observables which are required for quantum tomography; however, the
exact benefit for employing the dynamic approach depends strictly on how the
quantum system evolves in time. Algebraic analysis of phase-damping channels
allows one to determine optimal criteria for quantum tomography of systems in
question. General theorems and observations presented in the paper are
accompanied by a specific example, which shows step by step how the theory
works. The results introduced in this article can potentially be applied in
experiments where there is a tendency a look at quantum tomography from the
point of view of economy of measurements, because each distinct kind of
measurement requires, in general, preparing a separate setup.

annihilation signals. Depending on the substructure of the DM halo of a galaxy
cluster and the cross sections for DM annihilation channels, these signals
might be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. Here
we use three years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, which are the most
suitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearby
Virgo galaxy cluster. Our analysis reveals statistically significant extended
emission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profile
with a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. We
demonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends on
the adopted interstellar emission model (IEM) and is most likely an artifact of
our incomplete description of the IEM in this region. We also search for and
find new point source candidates in the region. We then derive conservative
upper limits on the velocity-averaged DM pair annihilation cross section from
Virgo. We take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due to
DM sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. For DM
annihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo model
setup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above the
expectation from the thermal cross section for
$m_{\mathrm{DM}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{GeV}$. In a more optimistic scenario, we
exclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$
for $m_{\mathrm{DM}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for the same channel. Finally, we
derive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-ray
interactions in the inter cluster medium. We find that the volume-averaged
cosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

an abelian topological gauge multiplet. This latter background is required for
the consistent coupling of the topological `matter' YM theory to topological
gravity. We make use of this topological point of view to obtain, in a simple
and straightforward way, a complete classification of localizing supersymmetric
backgrounds in two dimensions. The BRST invariant topological backgrounds are
parametrized by both Killing vectors and $S^1$-equivariant cohomology of the
2-dimensional world-sheet. We reconstruct completely the supergravity
backgrounds from the topological data: some of the supergravity fields are
twisted versions of the topological backgrounds, but others are ""composite"",
i.e. they are non-linear functionals of them. We recover all the known
localizing 2-dimensional backgrounds and (infinitely) many more that have not
been explored so far. We show that the supersymmetric $\Omega$-deformation is
nothing but the background value of the ghost-for-ghost of topological gravity,
a result which holds for other dimensions too. The new localizing backgrounds
are characterized by non-trivial fluxes for both the graviphotons of the
supergravity multiplet.

when combined with preparation and detection of qubit states in the
computational basis, are insufficient for universal quantum computation.
Indeed, any measurement results in such a system could be reproduced within a
local hidden variable theory, so that there is no need for a quantum mechanical
explanation and therefore no possibility of quantum speedup. Unfortunately,
Clifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and
measurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are
otherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum
computation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an
additional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate
the Bell-like CHSH inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable
theory. In this article, we both demonstrate the procedure for measuring Bell
violations in Majorana systems and introduce a new type of phase gate for the
already existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems. We conclude with an
experimentally feasible schematic combining the two, which should potentially
lead to the demonstration of Bell violation in a Majorana experiment in the
near future. Our work also naturally leads to a well-defined platform for
universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes, which
we describe.

H-rich envelopes almost completely in the direct pre-SN phase. Recently the
first 'flash spectrum' of a SN IIb (SN2013cu) has been presented, taken early
enough to study its immediate circumstellar medium (CSM). Similar to a previous
study by Groh (2014) we analyse the structure and chemical composition of the
optically-thick CSM using non-LTE model atmospheres. For the first time we take
light-travel time (LTT) effects on the spectrum formation into account, which
affect the shapes and strengths of the observable emission lines, as well as
the inferred SN luminosity. Based on the new CSM parameters we estimate a lower
limit of ~0.3Msun for the CSM mass, which is a factor 10-100 higher than
previous estimates. The spectral fit implies a CSM in the form of a homogeneous
and spherically symmetric superwind whose mass-loss rate exceeds common
expectations by up to two orders of magnitude. The derived chemical composition
is in agreement with a progenitor that has just left, or is just about to leave
the Red-Supergiant (RSG) stage, confirming the standard picture for the origin
of SNe IIb. Due to its extreme mass loss the SN progenitor will likely appear
as extreme RSG, Luminous Blue Variable (LBV), or Yellow Hypergiant (YHG). The
direct detection of a superwind, and the high inferred CSM mass suggest that
stellar wind mass loss may play an important role in the formation of SNe IIb.

antenna radomes. Unlike cloaks, such a transparent and self-invisible material
has yet to be demonstrated. Previous research has shown that a single sphere or

considerably suppressed scattering cross-section, due to the destructive
interference between two resonances in one of its scattering channels.
Nevertheless, a massive collection of these objects will have an accumulated
and detectable disturbance to the original field distribution. Here we overcome
this bottleneck by lining up the dark-state frequencies in different channels.
Specifically, we derive analytically, verify numerically and demonstrate
experimentally that deliberately designed corrugated metallic wires can have
record-low scattering amplitudes, achieved by aligning the nodal frequencies of
the first two scattering channels. This enables an arbitrary assembly of these
wires to be omnidirectionally invisible and the effective constitutive
parameters nearly identical to air. Measured transmission spectra at microwave

ICM entropy profiles that flatten at large cluster radii, as compared with the
self-similar prediction based on purely gravitational models of hierarchical
cluster formation, and gas fractions that rise above the mean cosmic value.
Weakening accretion shocks and the presence of unresolved cool gas clumps, both

been invoked to explain these results. In the outskirts of A1750, we find
entropy profiles that are consistent with self-similar expectations, and gas
fractions that are consistent with the mean cosmic value, both along and
perpendicular to the putative large scale filament. Thus, we find no evidence
for gas clumping in the outskirts of A1750, in either direction. This may
indicate that gas clumping is less common in lower temperature (kT~4keV), less
massive systems, consistent with some (but not all) previous studies of low
mass clusters and groups. Cluster mass may therefore play a more important role
in gas clumping than dynamical state. Finally, we find evidence for diffuse,

consistent with the expected properties of the denser, hotter phase of the

analytical reconstruction of the posterior from a point sample, like a Markov

This way, a multivariate posterior density can be reported efficiently, by
compressing the information contained in MCMC samples. Further, the model

This method is analogous to the search for normal parameters in the cosmic
microwave background, but is more general. The search for the optimally
Gaussianising transformation is performed computationally through a
maximum-likelihood formalism; its quality can be judged by how well the
credible regions of the posterior are reproduced. We demonstrate that our
method outperforms kernel density estimates in this objective. Further, we
select marginal posterior samples from Planck data with several distinct
strongly non-Gaussian features, and verify the reproduction of the marginal
contours. To demonstrate evidence computation, we Gaussianise the joint
distribution of data from weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO),
for different cosmological models, and find a preference for flat $\Lambda$CDM.

parametrise hyper- and vector-multiplet degrees of freedom and generalise
conventional complex, symplectic and hyper-Kahler geometries. The integrability
conditions for both hyper- and vector-multiplet structures are given by the
vanishing of moment maps for the ""generalised diffeomorphism group"" of
diffeomorphisms combined with gauge transformations. We give a number of
explicit examples and discuss the structure of the moduli spaces of solutions.

Bayesian inverse problems. However, MCMC struggles in high-dimensional
parameter spaces, since its iterates must sequentially explore the
high-dimensional space. This struggle is compounded in physical applications
when the nonlinear forward model is computationally expensive. One approach to
accelerate MCMC is to reduce the dimension of the state space. Active subspaces
are part of an emerging set of tools for subspace-based dimension reduction. An
active subspace in a given inverse problem indicates a separation between a
low-dimensional subspace that is informed by the data and its orthogonal
complement that is constrained by the prior. With this information, one can run
the sequential MCMC on the active variables while sampling independently
according to the prior on the inactive variables. However, this approach to
increase efficiency may introduce bias. We provide a bound on the Hellinger
distance between the true posterior and its active subspace- exploiting
approximation. And we demonstrate the active subspace-accelerated MCMC on two
computational examples: (i) a two-dimensional parameter space with a quadratic
forward model and one-dimensional active subspace and (ii) a 100-dimensional
parameter space with a PDE-based forward model and a two-dimensional active

report, most of the mobile Internet access traffic happens indoor. Leveraging
power line communication and the available indoor infrastructure, visible light
communication (VLC) can be utilized with small one-time cost. VLC also
facilitates the great advantage of being able to jointly perform illumination
and communications, and little extra power beyond illumination is required to
empower communications, thus rendering wireless access with small power
consumption. In this study, we investigate the problem of minimizing total
power consumption of a general multi-user VLC indoor network while satisfying
users' traffic demands and maintaining an acceptable level of illumination. We
utilize the column generation method to obtain an $\epsilon$-bounded solution.
Several practical implementation issues are integrated with the proposed

resolving the interference among VLC links. Through extensive simulations, we
show that our approach reduces the power consumption of the state-of-art
VLC-based scheduling algorithms by more than 60\% while maintaining the

$\alpha$ emitters (with rest-frame equivalent widths above 100 A, threshold
used in e.g. Trainor & Steidel, 2013) identified in a deep narrow-band 36x36
arcmin$^2$ image centered on the luminous quasar Q0420-388. These emitters are
found to the edge of the field and show some evidence of an azimuthal asymmetry
on the sky of the type expected if the quasar is radiating in a bipolar cone.
If these sources are being fluorescently illuminated by the quasar, the two
most distant objects require a lifetime of at least 15 Myr for an opening angle
of 60 degrees or more, increasing to more than 40 Myr if the opening angle is
reduced to a minimum 30 degrees. However, few of the other expected signatures
of boosted fluorescence are seen at the current survey limits, e.g. a fall off
in Lyman $\alpha$ brightness, or equivalent width, with distance. Furthermore,
to have most of the Lyman $\alpha$ emission of the two distant sources to be
fluorescently boosted would require the quasar to have been significantly
brighter in the past. This suggests that these particular sources may not be
fluorescent, invalidating the above lifetime constraints. This would cast doubt
on the use of this relatively low equivalent width threshold and thus on the

interference of the Berry phases associated a string of flipped spins (or

reflected in how the system respond to increasing spin polarization, increasing
the on-site repulsion, addition of a second hole, and increasing asymmetry

damped nonlinear periodic structure of finite length with disorder. Disorder is
introduced throughout the structure by small changes in the stiffness
parameters drawn from a uniform statistical distribution. Dispersion effects
forbid wave transmission within the stop band of the linear periodic structure.
However, nonlinearity leads to supratransmission phenomenon, by which enhanced
wave transmission occurs within the stop band of the periodic structure when
forced at an amplitude exceeding a certain threshold. The frequency components
of the transmitted waves lie within the pass band of the linear structure,
where disorder is known to cause Anderson localization. There is therefore a
competition between dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder in the context of
supratransmission. We show that supratransmission persists in the presence of
disorder. The influence of disorder decreases in general as the forcing
frequency moves away from the pass band edge, reminiscent of dispersion effects
subsuming disorder effects in linear periodic structures. We compute the
dependence of the supratransmission force threshold on nonlinearity and
strength of coupling between units. We observe that nonlinear forces are
confined to the driven unit for weakly coupled systems. This observation,
together with the truncation of higher-order nonlinear terms, permits us to
develop closed-form expressions for the supratransmission force threshold. In
sum, in the frequency range studied here, disorder does not influence the
supratransmission force threshold in the ensemble-average sense, but it does
reduce the average transmitted wave energy.

remote estimation problem that involves one perfect (noiseless) channel and one
extremely noisy channel (which corresponds to not transmitting the observed
state), a more realistic additive noise channel with fixed power constraint
along with a more costly perfect channel is considered. It is shown, via a
counter-example, that the common folklore of applying symmetric threshold
policy, which is well known to be optimal (for unimodal state densities) in the
classical two-channel remote estimation problem, can be suboptimal for the
setting considered. Next, in order to make the problem tractable, a side
channel which signals the sign of the underlying state is considered. It is
shown that, under some technical assumptions, threshold-in-threshold
communication scheduling is optimal for this setting. The impact of the
presence of a noisy channel is analyzed numerically based on dynamic
programming. This numerical analysis uncovers some rather surprising results
inheriting known properties from the noisy and noiseless settings.

to explain the anomalously large radii of highly irradiated gas giants. We now
know that the size of hot Jupiter radius anomalies scales strongly with a
planet's level of irradiation and numerous models like tidal heating, ohmic
dissipation, and thermal tides have since been developed to help explain these
inflated radii. In general however, these models can be grouped into two broad
categories: 1) models that directly inflate planetary radii by depositing a
fraction of the incident irradiation into the interior and 2) models that
simply slow a planet's radiative cooling allowing it to retain more heat from
formation and thereby delay contraction. Here we present a new test to
distinguish between these two classes of models. Gas giants orbiting at
moderate orbital periods around post main sequence stars will experience
enormous increases their irradiation as their host stars move up the sub-giant
and red-giant branches. If hot Jupiter inflation works by depositing
irradiation into the planet's deep interiors then planetary radii should
increase in response to the increased irradiation. This means that otherwise
non-inflated gas giants at moderate orbital periods >10 days can re-inflate as
their host stars evolve. Here we explore the circumstances that can lead to the
creation of these ""re-inflated"" gas giants and examine how the existence or
absence of such planets can be used to place unique constraints of the physics
of the hot Jupiter inflation mechanism. Finally, we explore the prospects for
detecting this potentially important undiscovered population of planets.

system of multivariate nonlinear equations which relate the power injections

solve these equations, starting from Newton-based methods to homotopy
continuation and other optimization-based methods. While many of these methods
often efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution due to its large basin

this tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in methods for
solving power flow equations to the wider power systems community as well as
bringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization

However, recent experimental results are proving this assumption as wrong.
Here, we study the differences in daily travel-time expenditures among 24
Italian cities, extracted from a large set of GPS data on vehicles mobility. To
understand these variations at the level of individual behaviour, we introduce
a trip duration model that allows for a description of the distribution of
travel-time expenditures in a given city using two parameters. The first
parameter reflects the accessibility of desired destinations, whereas the
second one can be associated to a travel-time budget and represents
physiological limits due to stress and fatigue. Within the same city, we
observe variations in the distributions according to home position, number of
mobility days and a driver's average number of daily trips. These results can
be interpreted by a stochastic time-consumption model, where the generalised
cost of travel times is given by a logarithmic-like function, in agreement with
the Weber-Fechner law. Our experimental results show a significant variability
in the travel-time budgets in different cities and for different categories of
drivers within the same city. This explicitly clashes with the idea of the
existence of a constant travel-time budget and opens new perspectives for the
modeling and governance of urban mobility.

aberrations and internal strain fields) on the width and shape of the

find that they lead to an homogeneous resonance broadening through two distinct
mechanisms: firstly, the acoustic frequency is directly influenced via
mechanical nonlinearities; secondly, the optical wave numbers are influenced
via the opto-mechanical nonlinearity leading to an additional acoustic
frequency shift via the phase-matching condition. We find that this second
mechanism is proportional to the opto-mechanical coupling and, hence, related
to the SBS-gain itself. It is absent in intra-mode forward SBS, while it plays
a significant role in backward scattering. In backward SBS increasing the
opto-acoustic overlap beyond a threshold defined by the fabrication tolerances
will therefore no longer yield the expected quadratic increase in overall
Stokes amplification. Finally, we illustrate in a numerical example that in
backward SBS and inter-mode forward SBS the existence of two broadening
mechanisms with opposite sign also opens the possibility to compensate the
effect of geometry-induced broadening. Our results can be transferred to other
micro- and nano-structured waveguide geometries such as photonic crystal
fibres.

synchronization in a directed scale-free network (SFN) of bursting neurons,
evolved via two independent $\alpha-$ and $\beta-$processes. The
$\alpha-$process corresponds to a directed version of the Barab\'{a}si-Albert
SFN model with growth and preferential attachment, while for the
$\beta-$process only preferential attachments between pre-existing nodes are
made without addition of new nodes. We first consider the ""pure""
$\alpha-$process of symmetric preferential attachment (with the same in- and
out-degrees), and study emergence of burst and spike synchronization by varying
the coupling strength $J$ and the noise intensity $D$ for a fixed attachment
degree. Characterizations of burst and spike synchronization are also made by
employing realistic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures. Next,
we choose appropriate values of $J$ and $D$ where only the burst
synchronization occurs, and investigate the effect of the scale-free
connectivity on the burst synchronization by varying (1) the symmetric
attachment degree and (2) the asymmetry parameter (representing deviation from
the symmetric case) in the $\alpha-$process, and (3) the occurrence probability
of the $\beta-$process. In all these three cases, changes in the type and the
degree of population synchronization are studied in connection with the network
topology such as the degree distribution, the average path length $L_p$, and
the betweenness centralization $B_c$. It is thus found that not only $L_p$ and
$B_c$ (affecting global communication between nodes) but also the in-degree

due to its simplicity and flexibility. Because the number of its parameters
scales quadratically with the number of the variables, QDA is not practical,
however, when the dimensionality is relatively large. To address this, we
propose a novel procedure named DA-QDA for QDA in analyzing high-dimensional
data. Formulated in a simple and coherent framework, DA-QDA aims to directly
estimate the key quantities in the Bayes discriminant function including
quadratic interactions and a linear index of the variables for classification.
Under appropriate sparsity assumptions, we establish consistency results for
estimating the interactions and the linear index, and further demonstrate that
the misclassification rate of our procedure converges to the optimal Bayes
risk, even when the dimensionality is exponentially high with respect to the
sample size. An efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) is developed for finding interactions, which is much
faster than its competitor in the literature. The promising performance of
DA-QDA is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and the analysis of four

experiment consistently terminates in a Walrasian price. The main result of
this paper is a mechanism in the spirit of the DOA that converges to a
Walrasian equilibrium in a polynomial number of steps, thus providing a
theoretical basis for the above-described empirical phenomenon. It is
well-known that computation of a Walrasian equilibrium for this market
corresponds to solving a maximum weight bipartite matching problem. The
uncoordinated but rational responses of agents thus solve in a distributed
fashion a maximum weight bipartite matching problem that is encoded by their
private valuations. We show, furthermore, that every Walrasian equilibrium is
reachable by some sequence of responses. This is in contrast to the well known
auction algorithms for this problem which only allow one side to make offers
and thus essentially choose an equilibrium that maximizes the surplus for the
side making offers. Our results extend to the setting where not every agent
pair is allowed to trade with each other.

inputs are enough to generate the minimum variance output estimate, given by
yn|n = Cxn|n + Dun. Same equation is implemented in most popular control design
toolboxes. It will be shown that when measurement and process noises are
correlated, or when the process noise directly feeds into measurements, this
equation is no longer optimal, and a correcting term is needed in above output

  This natural extension can allow designer to simplify noise modeling, reduce
estimator order, improve robustness to unknown noise models as well as estimate
unknown input, when expressed as an auxiliary output. This is directly
applicable in motion control applications which exhibits such feed-through,

difficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks

model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning
features that are useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters
identifying different terrains and man-made structures, including roads,
buildings, and farmlands, without any supervision beyond nighttime lights. We
demonstrate that these learned features are highly informative for poverty
mapping, even approaching the predictive performance of survey data collected

importance for many fields in astrophysics. Observations indicate that the
majority of stars are found in binary systems, while most stars with masses
greater than $0.5 M_\odot$ are formed in star clusters. In addition, since
binaries are on average more massive than single stars, in resolved star
clusters these systems are thought to be good tracers of (dynamical) mass
segregation. Over time, dynamical evolution through two-body relaxation will
cause the most massive objects to migrate to the cluster center, while the
relatively lower-mass objects remain in or migrate to orbits at greater radii.
This process will globally dominate a cluster's stellar distribution. However,
close encounters involving binary systems may disrupt `soft' binaries. This
process will occur more frequently in a cluster's central, dense region than in
its periphery, which may mask the effects of mass segregation. Using high
resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations, combined with sophisticated
$N$-body simulations, we investigate the radial distributions of the
main-sequence binary fractions in massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star
clusters. We show that binary disruption may play an important role on very
short timescales, depending on the environmental conditions in the cluster
cores. This may lead to radial binary fractions that initially decline in the
cluster centers, which is contrary to the effects expected from dynamical mass
segregation.

Majorana DM and scalar lepton mediators. Different from other similar models
with similar setup, we introduce both left-handed and right-handed scalar

clarify the mechanisms for quantum speedup, we first introduce the concept of
longitudinal and transverse types of speedup: the former stems from the time
evolution process itself with fixed initial conditions, while the latter is a
result of adjusting initial conditions. We then apply the proposed measure to
several typical closed and open quantum systems, illustrating that quantum

complexity-theoretic framework for the exploration of the nonlocal properties

proposed approach for establishing upper bounds is based on a hierarchy of
semidefinite programs introduced independently by Pironio et al. and Doherty et
al. This hierarchy converges to a value that is only known to coincide with the
provers' maximum success probability in a given proof system under a plausible
but difficult mathematical conjecture, Connes' embedding conjecture. No bounds
on the rate of convergence are known.
  We introduce a rounding scheme for the hierarchy, establishing that any
solution to its $N$-th level can be mapped to a strategy for the provers in
which measurement operators associated with distinct provers have pairwise
commutator bounded by $O(\ell^2/\sqrt{N})$ in operator norm, where $\ell$ is
the number of possible answers per prover.
  Our rounding scheme motivates the introduction of a variant of $\MIP^*$,
called $\MIP_\delta^*$, in which the soundness property is required to hold as
long as the commutator of operations performed by distinct provers has norm at
most $\delta$. Our rounding scheme implies the upper bound $\MIP_\delta^*

establish that $\MIP^*_{2^{-\poly}}$, with completeness $1$ and soundness
$1-2^{-\poly}$, contains $\NEXP$. The relationship of $\MIP_\delta^*$ to

edge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which
occur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is
because of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge
modes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing
directions. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than
charge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to
disorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent
and spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge
modes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic
scattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge
modes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH
edge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge
modes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall
edge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a
single disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune
to disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall
resistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.
In case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while
quantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a
finite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the
inelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip
and without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry
can have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in
quantum Hall case.

moderate radiation field, significant number of layers would be produced and
surface coverage is mainly dominated by photo-dissociation products such as,
C,CH_3,CH_2D,OH and OD. In the intermediate dense cloud regions (having number
density of total hydrogen nuclei in all forms ~ 2 x 10^4 cm^-3), water and

much higher density regions (~ 10^6 cm^-3), water and methanol productions are
suppressed but surface coverage of CO,CO_2,O_2,O_3 are dramatically increased.
We find a very high degree of fractionation of water and methanol.
Observational results support a high fractionation of methanol but surprisingly
water fractionation is found to be low. This is in contradiction with our model
results indicating alternative routes for de-fractionation of water. Effects of
various types of energy barriers are also studied. Moreover, we allow grain

prominent instances of the combination of a short-range and a long-range
interaction. For the description of light nuclei, the large nucleon-nucleon
scattering lengths produced by the strong interaction, and the reduction of the
weak interaction to the Coulomb potential, play a crucial role. Helium-3 is the
first bound nucleus comprised of more than one proton in which this combination
of forces can be studied.
  We demonstrate a proper renormalization of Helium-3 using the pionless
effective field theory as the formal representation of the nuclear regime as
strongly interacting fermions. The theory is found consistent at leading and
next-to-leading order without isospin-symmetry-breaking 3-nucleon interactions
and a non-perturbative treatment of the Coulomb interaction. The conclusion
highlights the significance of the regularization method since a comparison to
previous work is contradictory if the difference in those methods is not
considered.
  With a perturbative Coulomb interaction, as suggested by dimensional
analysis, we find the Helium-3 system properly renormalized, too.
  For both treatments, renormalization-scheme independence of the effective
field theory is demonstrated by regulating the potential and a variation of the
associated cutoff.

suggests that our Universe may simply be a region within an eternally inflating
super-region. Many other regions beyond our observable Universe would exist
with each such region governed by a different set of physical parameters.
Collision between these regions, if they occur, should leave signatures of
anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) but have not been seen. We
analyze the spectral properties of masked, foreground-cleaned maps between 100
and 545 GHz constructed from the Planck dataset. Four distinct $\sim2-4\arcdeg$
regions associated with CMB cold spots show anomalously strong 143 GHz emission
but no correspondingly strong emission at either 100 or 217 GHz. The signal to
noise of this 143 GHz residual emission is at the $\gtrsim$6$\sigma$ level
which reduces to $3.2-5.4\sigma$ after subtraction of remaining
synchrotron/free-free foregrounds. We assess different mechanisms for this
residual emission and conclude that although there is a 30\% probability that
noise fluctuations may cause foregrounds to fall within 3$\sigma$ of the
excess, there is less than a 0.5\% probability that foregrounds can explain all
the excess. A plausible explanation is that the collision of our Universe with
an alternate Universe whose baryon to photon ratio is a factor of $\sim$4500
larger than ours, could produce enhanced Hydrogen Paschen-series emission at
the epoch of recombination. Future spectral mapping and deeper observations at
100 and 217 GHz are needed to mitigate systematics arising from unknown
Galactic foregrounds and to confirm this unusual hypothesis.

certainly strike back through the measurements of the branching ratios of

simplified NP models and update the picture of flavour violation in the
Littlest Higgs model with T-parity taking all available constraints into

QCD and large N approach that give a strong indication for a new anomaly in
flavour physics, this time coming from K mesons. Indeed, \epe within the SM is
found to be significantly below the data of NA48 and KTeV collaborations.
Combining lattice results on the non-perturbative parameters B6 and B8 with the
assumption that the SM dynamics dominates the Delta I=1/2 rule a 3 sigma
anomaly in \epe emerges. Moreover, the recently derived upper bounds on B6 and
B8 from large N approach increase the confidence that the found anomaly could
be an important signal of NP at work. Of particular importance are the
correlations between K^+->pi^+\nu\bar\nu, K_L->\pi^0\nu\bar\nu and \epe. With
future precise measurements of K^+->pi^+\nu\bar\nu and K_L->\pi^0\nu\bar\nu and

Our observations were aimed at shedding light on the nature of MIPSGAL bubbles,
since their characterisation is a fundamental aid for the development of
accurate physical models of stellar and Galaxy evolution. The maser emission is
observatively linked to the last stages of the life of low- and
intermediate-mass stars, which may constitute a significant fraction of the
MIPSGAL bubbles. In particular OH masers are usually observed towards post-AGB
stars. Our observations were performed with the Green Bank Telescope and, for
each source, produced spectra around the four OH 18-cm transitions. The
observations were compared with archive interferometer data in order to exclude
possible contamination from nearby sources. The main result is that the OH

consists of recovering a high resolution image from its blurred, decimated and

strategies to handle the decimation and blurring operators. In addition to the
traditional first-order gradient methods, recent techniques investigate
splitting-based methods dividing the SR problem into up-sampling and
deconvolution steps that can be easily solved. Instead of following this
splitting strategy, we propose to deal with the decimation and blurring
operators simultaneously by taking advantage of their particular properties in
the frequency domain, leading to a new fast SR approach. Specifically, an
analytical solution can be obtained and implemented efficiently for the
Gaussian prior or any other regularization that can be formulated into an
$\ell_2$-regularized quadratic model, i.e., an $\ell_2$-$\ell_2$ optimization
problem. Furthermore, the flexibility of the proposed SR scheme is shown
through the use of various priors/regularizations, ranging from generic image
priors to learning-based approaches. In the case of non-Gaussian priors, we
show how the analytical solution derived from the Gaussian case can be embedded
intotraditional splitting frameworks, allowing the computation cost of existing
algorithms to be decreased significantly. Simulation results conducted on
several images with different priors illustrate the effectiveness of our fast

galaxies provides a standard ruler to measure the accelerated expansion of the
Universe. To extract all available information about dark energy, it is
necessary to measure a standard ruler in the local, z<0.2, universe where dark
energy dominates most the energy density of the Universe. Though the volume
available in the local universe is limited, it is just big enough to measure
accurately the long 100 Mpc/h wave-mode of the BAO. Using cosmological N-body
simulations and approximate methods based on Lagrangian perturbation theory, we
construct a suite of a thousand light-cones to evaluate the precision at which
one can measure the BAO standard ruler in the local universe. We find that
using the most massive galaxies on the full sky (34,000 sq. deg.), i.e. a
K(2MASS)<14 magnitude-limited sample, one can measure the BAO scale up to a
precision of 4\% and 1.2\% using reconstruction). We also find that such a
survey would help to detect the dynamics of dark energy.Therefore, we propose a
3-year long observational project, named the Low Redshift survey at Calar Alto
(LoRCA), to observe spectroscopically about 200,000 galaxies in the northern
sky to contribute to the construction of aforementioned galaxy sample. The
suite of light-cones is made available to the public.

making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware
resources. To address this limitation, we introduce ""deep compression"", a three
stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work
together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x
without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by
learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to
enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two
steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the
quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x;
Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection
from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required
by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method
reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of
accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than
off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of
complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and
download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU,
compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy
efficiency.

clumps at redshift z=3.042 and a possible AGN component of the lensing galaxy
at redshift z=0.2999 in the band 7 continuum image using a canonical lens
model, a singular isothermal ellipsoid plus an external shear. Then, we measure
the ratio of fluxes in some apertures at the source plane where the lensed
images are inversely mapped. We find that the aperture flux ratios of band 7
continuum image are perturbed by 10-20 percent with a significance at 2 ~ 3
sigma level. Moreover, we measure the astrometric shifts of multiply lensed
images near the caustic using the CO(8-7) line. Using a lens model best-fitted
to the band 7 continuum image, we reconstruct the source image of the CO(8-7)
line by taking linear combination of inverted quadruply lensed images. At the
50th channel (rest-frame velocity 28.6 km/s) of the CO(8-7) line, we find an
imprint of astrometric shifts of the order of 0.01 arcsec in the source image.
Based on a semi-analytic calculation, we find that the observed anomalous flux
ratios and the astrometric shifts can be explained by intergalactic dark
structures in the line of sight. A compensated homogeneous spherical clump with
a mean surface mass density of the order of 10^8 solar mass h^-1 arcsec^-2 can
explain the observed anomaly and astrometric shifts simultaneously.

The model takes into account the final $J/\psi$ absorption, target nucleon

the effect of their nuclear mean-field potential on these processes. We
calculate the A dependences of the absolute and relative (transparency ratio)
charmonium yields as well as its absolute and relative excitation functions
within the different scenarios for the $J/\psi N$ absorption cross section, for
the $J/\psi$ formation length and for $J/\psi$ in-medium modification. We
demonstrate that the studied observables, on the one hand, are not practically
affected by the charmonium formation length and mass shift effects and, on the
other hand, they are appreciably sensitive to the genuine $J/\psi N$ absorption
cross section at above threshold beam energies, which means that these
observables can be useful to help determine the $J/\psi N$ absorption cross
section from the comparison of the results of our calculations with the future
data from the experiments in the Hall C at the upgraded up to 12 GeV CEBAF
facility. We also show that the absolute and relative excitation functions for
$J/\psi$ subthreshold production in ${\gamma}A$ reactions reveal some
sensitivity to adopted in-medium modification scenarios for $J/\psi$ mesons.
Therefore, such observables, measured in the subthreshold energy domain, may be
an important tool to get valuable information on the charmonium in-medium
properties in cold nuclear matter.

of the metakaolin paste, and that dissipation during flow increases
quadratically with the bubble volume fraction. Comparison with yielding and
flow of model foamed yield stress fluids allows us to understand these results
in terms of coupling between the bubbles' surface tension and the metakaolin

ultrathin FeSe transistor on MgO also exhibits superconductivity around 40 K,
implying that the application of electric-field effectively contributes to the
high-TC superconductivity in ultrathin FeSe regardless of substrate material.

is expanded up to 10-unit-cells under applying electric-field and the

The appearance of a disconnected mass-radius branch emerging from the hybrid
star branch implies the existence of a third family of compact stars, so called
twin stars. Twin stars did not emerge as the transition pressure has to be
relatively small with a large jump in energy density, which could not be
satisfied within our approach. This is, among other reasons, due to the fact
that the speed of sound in QM has to be relatively high, which can be
accomplished by an increase of the repulsive coupling. This increase on the

plays a crucial role in the breaking of time translational invariance instead
of the spatial inversion. The second transition is manifested via time
aperiodic transverse fluctuations of the interface between the dyed and undyed

shear (LAOS) of polymers and wormlike micelles. In LAOStrain we find banding at
low frequencies and sufficiently high strain rate amplitudes in fluids for
which the underlying constitutive curve of shear stress as a function of shear
rate is non-monotonic. This is the direct analogue of quasi steady state
banding seen in slow strain rate sweeps along the flow curve. At higher
frequencies and sufficiently high strain amplitudes we report a different but
related phenomenon, which we call `elastic' shear banding. This is associated
with an overshoot in the elastic (Lissajous-Bowditch) curve of stress as a
function of strain. We suggest that this may arise widely even in fluids that
have a monotonic underlying constitutive curve, and so do not show steady state
banding under a steadily applied shear flow. In LAOStress we report banding in
fluids that shear thin strongly enough to have either a negatively, or weakly
positively, sloping region in the underlying constitutive curve, noting again
that fluids in the latter category do not display steady state banding in a
steadily applied flow. This banding is triggered in each half cycle as the
stress magnitude transits the region of weak slope in an upward direction, such
that the fluid effectively yields. Our numerics are performed in the Rolie-poly
model of polymeric fluids, but we also provide arguments suggesting that our
results should apply more widely. Besides banding in the shear rate profile,
which can be measured by velocimetry, we also predict banding in the shear and
normal stress components, measurable by birefringence. As a backdrop to
understanding the new results on shear banding in LAOS, we also briefly review
earlier work on banding in other time-dependent protocols, focusing in
particular on shear startup and step stress.

has grown into a key concept in computer science, physics and theoretical
biology. In its classical setting, a cellular automaton is a transformation of
the set of all configurations of a regular grid such that the image of any
particular cell of the grid is determined by a fixed local function that only
depends on a fixed finite neighbourhood. In recent years, with the introduction
of a generalised definition in terms of transformations of the form $\tau : A^G
\to A^G$ (where $G$ is any group and $A$ is any set), the theory of cellular
automata has been greatly enriched by its connections with group theory and
topology. In this paper, we begin the finite semigroup theoretic study of
cellular automata by investigating the rank (i.e. the cardinality of a smallest
generating set) of the semigroup $\text{CA}(\mathbb{Z}_n; A)$ consisting of all
cellular automata over the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and a finite set $A$. In

reported variation in the evolution of alpha by purely considering disformal
couplings. We also find that if matter and photons are coupled in the same way
to the scalar field, disformal couplings itself do not lead to a variation of
the fine-structure constant. A number of scenarios are discussed consistent
with the current astrophysical, geochemical, laboratory and the cosmic
microwave background radiation constraints on the cosmological evolution of
alpha. The models presented are also consistent with the current type Ia
supernovae constraints on the effective dark energy equation of state. We find
that the Oklo bound in particular puts strong constraints on the model

fixed cardinality it is known that the lower spectral radius can vary
discontinuously as a function of the matrix entries. In a previous article the

discontinuous on a set of positive (eight-dimensional) Lebesgue measure, and
related this result to an earlier conjecture of Bochi and Fayad. In this

simplified context in which one of the two matrices is assumed to be of rank
one. We show in particular that the set of discontinuities of the lower

long term neurological conditions with a platform to review their previous
physiotherapy sessions, as well as see their goals and any treatments or
exercises that their clinician has set for them to practice before their next
session.
  Objective: The initial application implemented 21 of the 27 core features
using the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC stack. However, the two core, non-functional
requirements were negated from the project due to lack of experience and strict
time constraints. This project aimed to investigate whether the application
would be more suited to a non-relational solution.
  Method: The application was re-written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB,
ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), an open source, fully JavaScript stack and then
performance tests were carried out to compare the two applications. A
scalability review was also conducted to assess the benefits and drawbacks of
each technology in this aspect.
  Results: The investigation proved that the non-relational solution was much
more efficient and performed faster. However, the choice of database was only a
small part of the increase in efficiency and it was an all-round better design
that gave the new application its performance upper hand.
  Conclusion: A proposal for a new application design is given that follows the
microservice architecture used by companies such as Amazon and Netflix. The
application is to be split up into four parts; database, client application,
server application and content delivery network. These four, independently
scalable and manageable services offer the greatest flexibility for future
development at the low costs necessary for a start-up.

excluding a sector in the parameter space of the particles which has not been

  polylog-size output","16 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To provide a dichotomy between those queries that can be made feasible on big
data after appropriate preprocessing and those for which preprocessing does not
help, Fan et al. developed the $\sqcap$-tractability theory. This theory
provides a formal foundation for understanding the tractability of query
classes in the context of big data. Along this line, we introduce a novel
notion of $\sqcap'$-tractability in this paper. Inspired by some technologies
used to deal big data, we place a restriction on preprocessing function, which
limits the function to produce a relatively small database as output, at most
polylog-size of the input database. At the same time, we bound the redundancy
information when re-factorizing data and queries for preprocessing. These
changes aim to make our theory more closely linked to practice. We set two
complexity classes to denote the classes of Boolean queries that are
$\sqcap'$-tractable themselves and that can be made $\sqcap'$-tractable,
respectively. Based on a new factorization in our complexity classes, we
investigate two reductions, which differ from whether allowing re-factorizing
data and query parts. We verify the transitive and compatible properties of the
reductions and analysis the complete problems and sizes of the complexity
classes. We conclude that all PTIME classes of Boolean queries can be made
$\sqcap'$-tractable, similar to that of the $\sqcap$-tractability theory. With
a little surprise, we prove that the set of all $\sqcap'$-tractable queries is
strictly smaller than that of all $\sqcap$-tractable queries, and thus the set
of $\sqcap'$-tractable queries is properly contained in that of PTIME queries.
In this way, we attain a new complexity class inside the complexity class of
PTIME queries.

structure which incorporates a two-fold asymmetry specifically aimed to
favorably enhance thermoelectric effects. The first asymmetry is introduced via
an interface layer of low thermal conductivity and high negative Seebeck
coefficient, such as, polycrystalline SiGe, between the bottom electrode
contact and the active region comprising the phase change material. This
results in an enhanced Peltier heating of the active material. The second one
is introduced structurally via a taper that results in an angle dependent
Thomson heating within the active region. Various device geometries are
analyzed using 2D-axis-symmetric simulations to predict the effect on
programming currents as well as for different thicknesses of the interface
layer. A programming current reduction of up to $60\%$ is predicted for
specific cell geometries. Remarkably, we find that due to an interplay of
Thomson cooling in the electrode and the asymmetric heating profile inside the
active region, the predicted programming current reduction is resilient to
fabrication variability.

limitations cause fundamental problems in numerical modelling of flaring loops,
such as selection of a structure and a number of threads, and an implementation
of a proper model of the energy deposition process. A set of 1D hydrodynamic
and 2D magnetohydrodynamic models of a flaring loop are developed to compare
energy redistribution and plasma dynamics in the course of a prototypical solar
flare. Basic parameters of the modeled loop are set according to the progenitor
M1.8 flare recorded in the AR10126 on September 20, 2002 between 09:21 UT and
09:50 UT. The non-ideal 1D models include thermal conduction and radiative
losses of the optically thin plasma as energy loss mechanisms, while the
non-ideal 2D models take into account viscosity and thermal conduction as
energy loss mechanisms only. The 2D models have a continuous distribution of
the parameters of the plasma across the loop, and are powered by varying in
time and space along and across the loop heating flux. We show that such 2D
models are a borderline case of a multi-thread internal structure of the
flaring loop, with a filling factor equal to one. Despite the assumptions used
in applied 2D models, their overall success in replicating the observations
suggests that they can be adopted as a correct approximation of the observed

parametrizations of the 21-cm signal itself, and propose one based on modelling
the Lyman-alpha background, IGM temperature and hydrogen ionized fraction using
tanh functions. This captures the shape of the signal from a physical modelling
code better than an earlier parametrization based on interpolating between
maxima and minima of the signal, and imposes a greater level of physical
plausibility. This allows less biased constraints on the turning points of the
signal, even though these are not explicitly fit for. Biases can also be
alleviated by discarding information which is less robustly described by the
parametrization, for example by ignoring detailed shape information coming from
the covariances between turning points or from the high-frequency parts of the
signal, or by marginalizing over the high-frequency parts of the signal by
fitting a more complex foreground model. The fits are sufficiently accurate to
be usable for experiments gathering 1000 h of data, though in this case it may
be important to choose observing windows which do not include the brightest
areas of the foregrounds. Our assumption of pointed, single-antenna
observations and very broad-band fitting makes these results particularly
applicable to experiments such as the Dark Ages Radio Explorer, which would

charges of optical vortices. We recorded the self-imaging of a diffraction
grating in the near-field regime with the optical vortex of several topological
charges. Our twisted light was generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM).
Previous studies showed that interferometric methods can determine the
particular orbital angular momentum (OAM) states, but a large number of OAM
eigenvalues are difficult to distinguish from the interference patterns. Here,
we show that the Talbot patterns can distinguish the charges as well as the OAM
of the vortices with high orders. Owing to high sensitivity and self-imaging of
Talbot effect, several OAM eigenvalues can be distinguished by direct
measurement. We assure the experimental results with our theory. The present
results are useful for classical and quantum metrology as well as future

problem in Information Theory which requires comparing the frequencies of
symbols in different sequences. In numerous modern applications, ranging from
DNA over music to texts, the distribution of symbol frequencies is
characterized by heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Zipf's law). The large
number of low-frequency symbols in these distributions poses major difficulties
to the estimation of the similarity between sequences, e.g., they hinder an
accurate finite-size estimation of entropies. Here we show analytically how the
systematic (bias) and statistical (fluctuations) errors in these estimations
depend on the sample size~$N$ and on the exponent~$\gamma$ of the heavy-tailed
distribution. Our results are valid for the Shannon entropy $(\alpha=1)$, its
corresponding similarity measures (e.g., the Jensen-Shanon divergence), and
also for measures based on the generalized entropy of order $\alpha$. For small
$\alpha$'s, including $\alpha=1$, the errors decay slower than the $1/N$-decay
observed in short-tailed distributions. For $\alpha$ larger than a critical
value $\alpha^* = 1+1/\gamma \leq 2$, the $1/N$-decay is recovered. We show the
practical significance of our results by quantifying the evolution of the
English language over the last two centuries using a complete $\alpha$-spectrum

equations with oscillating quasiperiodic coefficients $A_\epsilon$ specified by
the small parameter $\epsilon>0$. We use an iteration method generated by an
elliptic operator, associated with a certain simplified (e.g., homogenized)
problem. On each step of this procedure it is required to solve an auxiliary
elliptic boundary value problem with non--oscillating coefficients $A_0$. All
the information related to complicated coefficients of the original
differential problem is encompasses in the linear functional, which forms the
right hand side of the auxiliary problem. Therefore, explicit inversion of the
original operator associated with oscillating coefficients is avoided. The only
operation used instead is multiplication of the operator by a vector (vector
function), which can be efficiently performed due to the low-rank QTT tensor
operations with the rank parameter controlled by the given precision $\delta
>0$ independent on the parameter $\epsilon$. We deduce two--sided a posteriori
error estimates that do not use $A^{-1}_\epsilon$ and provide guaranteed two
sided bounds of the distance to the exact solution of the original problem for
any step of the iteration process. The second part is concerned with
realisations of the iteration method. For a wide class of oscillating
coefficients, we obtain sharp QTT rank estimates for the stiffness matrix in
tensor representation. In practice, this leads to the logarithmic complexity
scaling of the approximation and solution process in both the FEM grid-size,
and $O(\vert\log\epsilon\vert)$ cost in terms of $\epsilon$. Numerical tests in
1D confirm the logarithmic complexity scaling of our method applied to a class
of complicated quasiperiodic coefficients.

  Tasks","To be presented at CCS'15 (http://www.ccs2015.org/)",,"10.1007/s00477-016-1324-5",,"stat.CO stat.ME stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contemporary tasks of complex system simulation are often related to the
issue of uncertainty management. It comes from the lack of information or
knowledge about the simulated system as well as from restrictions of the model
set being used. One of the powerful tools for the uncertainty management is
ensemble-based simulation, which uses variation in input or output data, model
parameters, or available versions of models to improve the simulation
performance. Furthermore the system of models for complex system simulation
(especially in case of hiring ensemble-based approach) can be considered as a
complex system. As a result, the identification of the complex model's
structure and parameters provide additional sources of uncertainty to be
managed. Within the presented work we are developing a conceptual and
technological approach to manage the ensemble-based simulation taking into
account changing states of both simulated system and system of models within
the ensemble-based approach. The states of these systems are considered as a
subject of classification with consequent inference of better strategies for
ensemble evolution over the simulation time and ensemble aggregation. Here the
ensemble evolution enables implementation of dynamic reactive solutions which
can automatically conform to the changing states of both systems. The ensemble
aggregation can be considered within a scope of averaging (regression way) or
selection (classification way, which complement the classification mentioned
earlier) approach. The technological basis for such approach includes
ensemble-based simulation techniques using domain-specific software combined
within a composite application; data science approaches for analysis of
available datasets (simulation data, observations, situation assessment etc.);
and machine learning algorithms for classes identification, ensemble management
and knowledge acquisition.

acoustic characteristics of a room based on such parameters can be used to
predict the quality and intelligibility of speech signals in that room.
Recently, several important methods in speech enhancement and speech
recognition have been developed that show an increase in performance compared
to the predecessors but do require knowledge of one or more fundamental
acoustical parameters such as the T60. Traditionally, these parameters have
been estimated using carefully measured Acoustic Impulse Responses (AIRs).
However, in most applications it is not practical or even possible to measure
the acoustic impulse response. Consequently, there is increasing research
activity in the estimation of such parameters directly from speech and audio
signals. The aim of this challenge was to evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms
for blind acoustic parameter estimation from speech and to promote the emerging
area of research in this field. Participants evaluated their algorithms for T60
and DRR estimation against the 'ground truth' values provided with the
data-sets and presented the results in a paper describing the method used.

condition $s/T^3\simeq7$ remains valid for $\mu\lesssim 0.3~$GeV. Then, due to
the dependence of $T$ on $\mu$, the values of $s/T^3$ increase with increasing
