long-chain carbon molecules are formed in interstellar space and circumstellar

form of carbon: fullerenes. The most emblematic fullerene (i.e. C$_{60}$
""buckminsterfullerene""), contains exactly 60 carbon atoms organized in a
cage-like structure similar to a soccer ball. Since their discovery impacted
the field of nanotechnologies, Kroto and colleagues received the Nobel prize in
1996. The cage-like structure, common to all fullerene molecules, gives them
unique properties, in particular an extraordinary stability. For this reason
and since they were discovered in experiments aimed to reproduce conditions in
space, fullerenes were sought after by astronomers for over two decades, and it
is only recently that they have been firmly identified by spectroscopy, in
evolved stars and in the interstellar medium. This identification offers the
opportunity to study the molecular physics of fullerenes in the unique physical
conditions provided by space, and to make the link with other large
carbonaceous molecules thought to be present in space : polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons.

numerical schemes based on a time discretization. On the other hand, in the
linear case, i.e. where the solution is given by a stochastic convolution, our
result complements the known stochastic maximal space-time regularity results

well developed third minimum along the fission paths of Ra nuclei, is analyzed

functions of the neutron number in the parent Ra isotope. The comparison
between fission and $\alpha$-decay half-lives, reveals that the former becomes
faster for increasing neutron numbers. Though there exists a strong variance of
the results with respect to the parameters used in the computation of the
spontaneous fission rate, a change in tendency is observed at N=164 with a
steady increase that makes heavier neutron-rich Ra isotopes stable against
fission, diminishing the importance of fission recycling in the r-process.

curves (a.k.a. Type IIL supernovae) are explosions of progenitors with low-mass
hydrogen-rich envelopes which are of the order of 1 Msun. We investigate
light-curve properties of supernovae from such progenitors. We confirm that
such progenitors lead to rapidly fading Type II supernovae. We find that the
luminosity of supernovae from such progenitors with the canonical explosion
energy of 1e51 erg and 56Ni mass of 0.05 Msun can increase temporarily shortly
before all the hydrogen in the envelope recombines. As a result, a bump appears
in their light curves. The bump appears because the heating from the nuclear
decay of 56Ni can keep the bottom of hydrogen-rich layers in the ejecta
ionized, and thus the photosphere can stay there for a while. We find that the
light-curve bump becomes less significant when we make explosion energy larger
(>~ 2e51 erg), 56Ni mass smaller (<~ 0.01 Msun), 56Ni mixed in the ejecta, or
the progenitor radius larger. Helium mixing in hydrogen-rich layers makes the
light-curve decline rates large but does not help reducing the light-curve
bump. Because the light-curve bump we found in our light-curve models has not
been observed in rapidly fading Type II supernovae, they may be characterized
by not only low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes but also higher explosion energy,
larger degrees of 56Ni mixing, and/or larger progenitor radii than slowly
fading Type II supernovae, so that the light-curve bump does not become
significant.

interactions do not receive perturbative contributions beyond genus three. We
derive Poisson equations satisfied by these moduli dependent string amplitudes.
These T--duality invariant equations have eigenvalues that are completely
determined by the structure of the integrands of the multi--loop amplitudes.
The source terms are given by boundary terms of the moduli space of Riemann
surfaces corresponding to both separating and non--separating nodes. These are
determined directly from the string amplitudes, as well as from the logarithmic
divergences of maximal supergravity. We explicitly solve these Poisson
equations in nine and eight dimensions.

uniqueness theorems. However, the no-hair conjecture is not true in general,
and there is now a plethora of matter models possessing hairy black hole
solutions. In this note we focus on one such matter model: Einstein-Yang-Mills
(EYM) theory, and restrict our attention to four-dimensional, static,
non-rotating black holes for simplicity. We outline some of the menagerie of
EYM solutions in both asymptotically flat and asymptotically anti-de Sitter

  Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP 2015)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.NA math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a technique for estimating a structured covariance matrix from
observations of a random vector which have been sketched. Each observed random
vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ is reduced to a single number by taking its inner
product against one of a number of pre-selected vector $\boldsymbol{a}_\ell$.
These observations are used to form estimates of linear observations of the
covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\varSigma}$, which is assumed to be
simultaneously sparse and low-rank. We show that if the sketching vectors
$\boldsymbol{a}_\ell$ have a special structure, then we can use straightforward
two-stage algorithm that exploits this structure. We show that the estimate is
accurate when the number of sketches is proportional to the maximum of the rank
times the number of significant rows/columns of $\boldsymbol{\varSigma}$.
Moreover, our algorithm takes direct advantage of the low-rank structure of
$\boldsymbol{\varSigma}$ by only manipulating matrices that are far smaller
than the original covariance matrix.

universality of the Cartesian product $P \times C$ of the space $P$ of all
possible computer programs of increasing size and the space $C$ of all possible
compilers of increasing length such that $p \in P$ emulates $p^\prime \in P$
with $T|p^\prime|=|p|$ under a coarse-graining transformation $T$. Our approach
yields a novel perspective on the complexity, controllability, causality and
(re)programmability discrete dynamical systems. We find evidence that the
density of (qualitatively different) computer programs that can be reprogrammed
grows asymptotically as a function of program and compiler size. To illustrate
these findings we show a series of behavioural boundary crossing results,
including emulations (for all initial conditions) of Wolfram class 2 Elementary
Cellular Automata (ECA) by Class 1 ECA, emulations of Classes 1, 2 and 3 ECA by
Class 2 and 3 ECA, and of Classes 1, 2 and 3 by Class 3 ECA, along with results
of even greater emulability for general CA (neighbourhood $r=3/2$), including
Class 1 CA emulating Classes 2 and 3, and Classes 3 and 4 emulating all other
classes (1, 2, 3 and 4). The emulations occur with only a linear overhead and
can be considered computationally efficient. We also found that there is no
hacking strategy to compress the search space based on compiler profiling in
terms of e.g. similarity or complexity, suggesting that no strategy other than
exhaustive search is viable. We also introduce emulation networks, derive a
topologically-based measure of complexity based upon out- and in-degree
connectivity, and establish bridges to fundamental ideas of complexity,
universality, causality and dynamical systems.

uncertainties due to poorly constrained input parameters. In most future
applications to date, model calibration has utilized only modern or recent

of localized time series, while modern observations are non-Gaussian spatial
data; combining information across these types poses non-trivial statistical
challenges. Here we introduce a computationally efficient calibration approach
that utilizes both modern and paleo-observations to generate better-constrained
ice volume projections. Using fast emulators built upon principal component
analysis and a reduced dimension calibration model, we can efficiently handle
high-dimensional and non-Gaussian data. We apply our calibration approach to
the PSU3D-ICE model which can realistically simulate long-term behavior of
WAIS. Our results show that using paleo observations in calibration
significantly reduces parametric uncertainty, resulting in sharper projections

found to be that unrealistic simulations with overshoots in past ice retreat

the generalised master equation leads to the OQWs formalism. The explicit form

better risk-adjusted returns for low-vol stocks. This effect is further
amplified by compounding. We find that the low-vol strategy is not associated

its overall skewness is slightly positive. For practical purposes, the strong

with the intruder, despite the latter's rapid deceleration. Simulations
indicate that this observation is insensitive to grain properties, which can be
explained by the separation of time scales between intergrain force dynamics
and intruder dynamics. Assuming there is a comparable separation of time
scales, we expect our results are applicable to a broad class of dynamic or

(TDRNOT) is based on the equations of motion for the so-called natural

Exact TDRNOT can be formulated for any time-dependent two-electron system in
either spin configuration. In this paper, the method is tested against
high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and Fano profiles in absorption spectra
with the help of a numerically exactly solvable one-dimensional model He atom,
starting from the spin-singlet ground state. Such benchmarks are challenging
because Fano profiles originate from transitions involving autoionizing states,
and HHG is a strong-field phenomenon well beyond linear response. TDRNOT with
just one natural orbital per spin in the helium spin-singlet case is equivalent
to time-dependent Hartree-Fock or time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) in exact exchange-only approximation. It is not unexpected that TDDFT
fails in reproducing Fano profiles due to the lack of doubly excited,
autoionizing states. HHG spectra, on the other hand, are widely believed to be
well-captured by TDDFT. However, HHG spectra of helium may display a second
plateau that originates from simultaneous HHG in He$^+$ and neutral He. It is
found that already TDRNOT with two natural orbitals per spin is sufficient to
capture this effect as well as the Fano profiles on a qualitative level. With
more natural orbitals (6--8 per spin) quantitative agreement can be reached.
Errors due to the truncation to a finite number of orbitals are identified.

for which the fragmenting parton is the top quark, gluon, $W$, $Z$, and the

Standard Model coupling constants. The factorization formula enables the
resummation of large logarithms of $P_T/M_H$ due to final-state radiation by
integrating evolution equations for the fragmentation functions. By comparing

on the same approach used during LHC Run 1, namely the Optimal Filter. The only
difference is that the signal baseline (pedestal) will be subtracted from the

of such information reduces the bias and uncertainties introduced by signal
pile-up. The performance of the Optimal Filter version used in Run 1 and Run 2

in high density regions. Small haloes can be found in a wide range of
environments which determine their clustering amplitudes differently. This
contradicts the assumption of standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)
models that the bias and occupation of haloes is determined solely by their
mass. We show that the bias of central galaxies from semi-analytic models of

predicted by the standard HOD model. Using local density instead of halo mass
the HOD model correctly predicts galaxy bias. These results indicate the need

grid types, the discretization is stable with respect to the limits of
incompressible fluid and small time-steps. 3) No artificial stabilization term
has been introduced. Furthermore, due to the finite volume structure embedded
in the discretization, explicit local expressions for both momentum-balancing
forces as well as mass-conservative fluid fluxes are available.
  We prove stability of the proposed method with respect to all relevant
limits. Together with consistency, this proves convergence of the method.
Finally, we give numerical examples verifying both the analysis and convergence
of the method.

nuclei (AGN) are attributed to energetic electrons in the plasma ejecta from
the accretion flows near the black hole in these systems. It is argued that
magnetic reconnection could occur in the coronae above the accretion disk
around the black hole, and that this drives plasmoid outflows resembling the
solar coronal mass ejection (CME) phenomenon. The X-ray and radio flares are
emission from energetic electrons produced in the process. As the emission
region is located near the black hole event horizon, the flare emission would
be subject to special- and general-relativistic effects. We present
calculations of the flaring emission from plasmoids orbiting around a black
hole and plasmoid ejecta launched from the inner accretion disk when
general-relativistic effects are crucial in determining the observed
time-dependent properties of the emission. We consider fully
general-relativistic radiative transfer calculations of the emission from
evolving ejecta from black hole systems, with proper accounting for
differential arrival times of photons emitted from the plasmoids, and determine
the emission lightcurves of plasmoids when they are in orbit and when they
break free from their magnetic confinement. The implications for interpreting

the dominant form of dark matter (DM). The ULA is light enough to be detectable
in cosmology from its imprints on structure formation, and may resolve the
small-scale problems of cold DM. The necessary relative DM abundances occur
without fine tuning in constructions with decay constants $f_{\rm ULA}\sim
10^{17}\text{ GeV}$, and $f_{\rm QCD}\sim 10^{11}\text{ GeV}$. An example model
achieving this has $N=24$, and we construct a range of other possibilities. We
compute the ULA couplings to the Standard Model, and discuss prospects for
direct detection. The QCD axion may be detectable in standard experiments
through the $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ and $G\tilde{G}$ couplings. In the simplest
models, however, the ULA has identically zero coupling to both $G\tilde{G}$ of
QCD and $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ of electromagnetism due to vanishing
electromagnetic and color anomalies. The ULA couples to fermions with strength
$g\propto 1/f_{\rm ULA}$. This coupling causes spin precession of nucleons and
electrons with respect to the DM wind with period $t\sim$months. Current limits
do not exclude the predicted coupling strength, and our model is within reach
of the CASPEr-Wind experiment, using nuclear magnetic resonance.

during the pre-main sequence (pre-MS). We find that heavy spot coverage
increases the radii of stars by 4-10%, consistent with inflation factors in
eclipsing binary systems, and suppresses the rate of pre-MS lithium depletion,
leading to a dispersion in zero-age MS Li abundance (comparable to observed
spreads) if a range of spot properties exist within clusters from 3-10 Myr.
This concordance with data implies that spots induce a range of radii at fixed
mass during the pre-MS. These spots decrease the luminosity and $T_{\rm eff}$
of stars, leading to a displacement on the HR diagram. This displacement causes
isochrone derived masses and ages to be systematically under-estimated, and can
lead to the spurious appearance of an age spread in a co-eval population.

due to the presence of high and thick clouds or haze. Here, we simulate the
atmosphere of GJ1214b with a 3D General Circulation Model for cloudy
hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, including cloud radiative effects. We show that
the atmospheric circulation is strong enough to transport micrometric cloud
particles to the upper atmosphere and generally leads to a minimum of cloud at
the equator. By scattering stellar light, clouds increase the planetary albedo
to 0.4-0.6 and cool the atmosphere below 1 mbar. However, the heating by ZnS
clouds leads to the formation of a stratospheric thermal inversion above 10
mbar, with temperatures potentially high enough on the dayside to evaporate KCl
clouds. We show that flat transit spectra consistent with HST observations are
possible if cloud particle radii are around 0.5 micron, and that such clouds
should be optically thin at wavelengths > 3 microns. Using simulated cloudy
atmospheres that fit the observed spectra we generate transit, emission and
reflection spectra and phase curves for GJ1214b. We show that a stratospheric
thermal inversion would be readily accessible in near and mid-infrared
atmospheric spectral windows. We find that the amplitude of the thermal phase
curves is strongly dependent on metallicity, but only slightly impacted by
clouds. Our results suggest that primary and secondary eclipses and phase
curves observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the near to mid-infrared
should provide strong constraints on the nature of GJ1214b's atmosphere and

sample presented in this work is obtained from the High $A_V$ Quasar (HAQ)
survey. The quasar candidates were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and follow-up
spectroscopy was carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the New
Technology Telescope (NTT). To study dust extinction curves intrinsic to the
quasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). We derived the extinction curves using Fitzpatrick &
Massa 1986 (FM) law by comparing the observed SEDs to the combined quasar
template from Vanden Berk et al. 2001 and Glikman et al. 2006. The derived
extinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction
curves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a
weighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$. We derive an `average quasar extinction
curve' for our sample by fitting SEDs simultaneously by using the weighted mean
values of the FM law parameters and a varying $R_V$. The entire sample is well
fit with a single best-fit value of $R_V=2.2\pm0.2$. The `average quasar
extinction curve' deviates from the steepest Milky Way and SMC extinction
curves at a confidence level $\gtrsim95\%$. Such steep extinction curves
suggest a significant population of silicates to produce small dust grains.
Moreover, another possibility could be that the large dust grains may have been
destroyed by the activity of the nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), resulting
in steep extinction curves.

masses in a simulation cube of length 100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Since strong
disturbances to a halo (such as might be indicated by a large change in the
spin direction) are likely also to disturb the galaxy evolving within, spin
flips could be a mechanism for galaxy morphological transformation without
involving major mergers. We find that 35% of haloes have, at some point in
their lifetimes, had a spin flip of at least $45\deg$ that does not coincide
with a major merger. Over 75% of large spin flips coincide with non-major
mergers; only a quarter coincide with major mergers. We find a similar picture
for changes to the inner-halo spin orientation, although here there is an
increased likelihood of a flip occurring. Changes in halo angular momentum
orientation, and other such measures of halo perturbation, are therefore very
important quantities to consider, in addition to halo mergers, when modelling
the formation and evolution of galaxies and confronting such models with
observations.

effective theory, we compute the three-loop massless QCD corrections to the
form factor that describes the coupling of a pseudo-scalar Higgs boson to
gluons. Due to the axial anomaly, the pseudo-scalar operator for the gluonic
field strength mixes with the divergence of the axial vector current. Working
in dimensional regularization and using the 't~Hooft-Veltman prescription for
the axial vector current, we compute the three-loop pseudo-scalar form factors
for massless quarks and gluons. Using the universal infrared factorization
properties, we independently derive the three-loop operator mixing and finite
operator renormalisation from the renormalisation group equation for the form
factors, thereby confirming recent results in the operator product expansion.
The finite part of the three-loop form factor is an important ingredient to the
precise prediction of the pseudo-scalar Higgs boson production cross section at
hadron colliders. We discuss potential applications and derive the hard

ends and another language begins in a text written in more than one language.
This is important for all natural language processing tasks. The problem can be
solved by training language models on language data. However, in the case of
low- or no-resource languages, this is problematic. I therefore investigate
whether unsupervised methods perform better than supervised methods when it is
difficult or impossible to train supervised approaches. A special focus is
given to difficult texts, i.e. texts that are rather short (one sentence),
containing abbreviations, low-resource languages and non-standard language. I
compare three approaches: supervised n-gram language models, unsupervised
clustering and weakly supervised n-gram language model induction. I devised the
weakly supervised approach in order to deal with difficult text specifically.
In order to test the approach, I compiled a small corpus of different text
types, ranging from one-sentence texts to texts of about 300 words. The weakly
supervised language model induction approach works well on short and difficult
texts, outperforming the clustering algorithm and reaching scores in the
vicinity of the supervised approach. The results look promising, but there is
room for improvement and a more thorough investigation should be undertaken.

distribution in late time is a promising tool for constraining the dark energy
properties. Here, we study the effect of dark energy clustering on the
ISW-galaxy cross correlation and demonstrate the fact that the bias parameter
between the distribution of the galaxies and the underlying dark matter
introduces a degeneracy and complications. We argue that as the galaxy's host
halo formation time is different from the observation time, we have to consider
the evolution of the halo bias parameter. It will be shown that any deviation
from $\Lambda$CDM model will change the evolution of the bias as well.
Therefore, it is deduced that the halo bias depends strongly on the sub-sample
of galaxies which is chosen for cross correlation and that the joint kernel of
ISW effect and the galaxy distribution has a dominant effect on the observed
signal. In this work, comparison is made specifically between the clustered
dark energy models using two samples of galaxies. The first one is a sub-sample
of galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey, chosen with the r-band magnitude $18
< r < 21$ and the dark matter halo host of mass $M \sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and
formation redshift of $z_{f}\sim 2.5$. The second one is the sub-sample of
Luminous Red galaxies with the dark matter halo hosts of mass $M \sim
10^{13}M_{\odot}$ and formation redshift of $z_{f}\sim 2.0$. Using the evolved
bias we improve the $\chi^2$ for the $\Lambda$CDM which reconciles the

confined to the edges of the 2D electron liquid. The velocities of edge modes

Hall systems from time-resolved measurements and high-frequency ac transport.
We propose a way to extract edge velocities from dc transport in a point
contact geometry defined by narrow gates. The width of the gates assumes two
different sizes at small and large distances from the point contact. The
Coulomb interaction across the gates depends on the gate width and affects the
conductance of the contact. The conductance exhibits two different temperature
dependencies at high and low temperatures. The transition between the two
regimes is determined by the edge velocity. An interesting feature of the
low-temperature I-V curve is current oscillations as a function of the voltage.
The oscillations emerge due to charge reflection from the interface of the
regions defined by the narrow and wide sections of the gates.

one. We propose an extension of this technique when the measurement process
cannot be simply described by an instantaneous POVM. Instead, the tomography
relies on a set of quantum trajectories and their measurement records. This
model includes the fact that, in practice, each measurement could be corrupted
by imperfections and decoherence, and could also be associated with the record
of continuous-time signals over a finite amount of time. The goal is then to
retrieve the quantum state that was present at the start of this measurement
process. The proposed extension relies on an explicit expression of the
likelihood function via the effective matrices appearing in quantum smoothing
and solutions of the adjoint quantum filter. It allows to retrieve the initial
quantum state as in standard MaxLike tomography, but where the traditional POVM
operators are replaced by more general ones that depend on the measurement
record of each trajectory. It also provides, aside the MaxLike estimate of the
quantum state, confidence intervals for any observable. Such confidence
intervals are derived, as the MaxLike estimate, from an asymptotic expansion of
multi-dimensional Laplace integrals appearing in Bayesian Mean estimation. A
validation is performed on two sets of experimental data: photon(s) trapped in

frequencies around 100~MHz. Kijak et al. have reported the presence of a new
class of ''Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum'' (GPS) pulsars that show spectral
turnovers at frequencies around 1 GHz. We apply a model based on free-free
thermal absorption to explain these turnovers in terms of surrounding material
such as the dense environments found in HII regions, Pulsar Wind Nebulae
(PWNe), or in cold, partially ionized molecular clouds. We show that the
turnover frequency depends on the electron temperature of the environment close
to the pulsar, as well as the emission measure along the line of sight. We
fitted this model to the radio fluxes of known GPS pulsars and show that it can
replicate the GHz turnover. From the thermal absorption model, we demonstrate
that normal pulsars would exhibit a GPS-like behaviour if they were in a dense
environment. We discuss the application of this model in the context of
determining the population of neutron stars within the central parsec of the
Galaxy. We show that a non-negligible fraction of this population might exhibit
high-frequency spectral turnovers, which has implications on the detectability

Eddington factors $\dot m_{\rm acc} \sim 10 - 100$ the photospheric
temperatures of the winds are $\sim 100$\, eV, consistent with the picture that
the ultraluminous supersoft sources (ULSs) are ULXs seen outside the
medium--energy X--ray beam, unifying the ULX/ULS populations and SS433
(actually a ULS but with photospheric emission too soft to detect). For
supermassive black holes (SMBHs), feedback from hyper--Eddington accretion is
significantly more powerful than the usual near--Eddington (`UFO') case, and if
realised in nature would imply $M - \sigma$ masses noticeably smaller than
observed. We suggest that the likely warping of the accretion disc in such
cases may lead to much of the disc mass being expelled, severely reducing the
incidence of such strong feedback. We show that hyper--Eddington feedback from

identification of variable sources, such as AGNs, and the achievable redshift
accuracy for varying objects are important in view of the science goals of the
EUCLID and eROSITA missions. We probe AGN optical variability for a large
sample of X-ray-selected AGNs in the XMM-COSMOS field, using the light curves
provided by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3pi and MDF04 surveys. Utilizing two
different variability parameters, we defined a sample of varying AGNs for every
PS1 band. We investigated the influence of variability on the calculation of
photo-z by applying three different input photometry sets for our fitting
procedure. For each of the five PS1 bands, we chose either the epochs
minimizing the interval in observing time, the median magnitude values, or
randomly drawn light curve points to compute the redshift. In addition, we
derived photo-z using PS1 photometry extended by GALEX/IRAC bands. We find that
the photometry produced by the 3pi survey is sufficient to reliably detect
variable sources provided that the fractional variability amplitude is at least
3%. Considering the photo-z of variable AGNs, we observe that minimizing the
time spacing of the chosen points yields superior photo-z in terms of the
percentage of outliers (33%) and accuracy (0.07), outperforming the other two
approaches. Drawing random points from the light curve gives rise to typically
57% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.4. Adding GALEX/IRAC bands for the
redshift determination weakens the influence of variability. Although the
redshift quality generally improves when adding these bands, we still obtain
not less than 26% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.05 at best, therefore
variable sources should receive a flag stating that their photo-z may be low
quality.

quantify systematic uncertainties in $\eta$ resulting from the photometric

The detector consists of a triple GEM stack with a small drift region that was
operated in a mini TPC type configuration. Both the position and arrival time
of the charge deposited in the drift region were measured on the readout plane
which allowed the reconstruction of a short vector for the track traversing the
chamber. The resulting position and angle information from the vector could

detector was studied in test beams at Fermilab and CERN, along with additional
measurements in the lab, in order to determine its position and angular
resolution for incident track angles up to 45 degrees. Several algorithms were
studied for reconstructing the vector using the position and timing information
in order to optimize the position and angular resolution of the detector for

computed as a function of three system parameters: angles of rotation about

also consider the dependence on $\bar{R}$, which parametrizes the concentric

asymptotic mixing value, $bias$. We find that most choices of angles and most
shells throughout the tumbler volume mix well, with mixing near the center of
the tumbler being consistently faster (small $\tau$) and more complete (small
$bias$). We conclude with examples and discussion of the pathological mixing

resonant features in the CMB correlation functions, combining power spectrum
and bispectrum measurements. This significance is typically addressed by
running a large number of simulations to derive the probability density
function (PDF) of the feature-amplitude in the Gaussian case. Although these
simulations are tractable for the power spectrum, for the bispectrum they
require significant computational resources. We show that, by assuming that the
PDF is given by a multi-variate Gaussian where the covariance is determined by
the Fisher matrix of the sine and cosine terms, we can efficiently produce
spectra that are statistically close to those derived from full simulations. By
drawing a large number of spectra from this PDF, both for the power spectrum
and the bispectrum, we can quickly determine the statistical significance of
candidate signatures in the CMB, considering both single frequency and
multi-frequency estimators. We show that for resonance models, cosmology and
foreground parameters have little influence on the estimated amplitude, which
allows to simplify the analysis considerably. A more precise likelihood
treatment can then be applied to candidate signatures only. We also discuss a
modal expansion approach for the power spectrum, aimed at quickly scanning

optical process using non-local response functions that intrinsically include
all multipoles. We present a semi-classical approach to the non-linear response
functions based on the minimal coupling Hamiltonian. The first, second and
third order non-local response functions are expressed in terms of correlation
functions of the charge and the current densities. This approach is based on
the gauge invariant current rather than the polarization, and on the vector

Different materials are studied that differ only by the bending rigidity of the
interactions in a Stillinger-Weber modelization used to describe amorphous
silicon. The local bending rigidity can thus be used as a control parameter, to
tune the sound velocity together with local bonds directionality. It is shown
that for all the systems studied, the upper limit of the Boson peak corresponds
to the Ioffe-Regel criterion for transverse waves, as well as to a minimum of
the diffusivity. The Boson peak is followed by a diffusivity's increase
supported by longitudinal phonons. The Ioffe-Regel criterion for transverse
waves corresponds to a common characteristic mean-free path of 5-7 \AA{} (which
is slightly bigger for longitudinal phonons), while the fine structure of the
vibrational density of states is shown to be sensitive to the local bending
rigidity.

source-destination pairs under queueing constraints has been investigated for
both variable-rate and fixed-rate schemes. When channel side information (CSI)
is available at the transmitter side, transmitters can adapt their transmission
rates according to the channel conditions, and achieve the instantaneous
channel capacities. In this case, the departure rates at each node have been
characterized for different system parameters, which control the power
allocation, time allocation and decoding order. In the other case of no CSI at
the transmitters, a simple automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol with fixed
rate transmission is used to provide reliable communication. Under this ARQ
assumption, the instantaneous departure rates at each node can be modeled as an
ON-OFF process, and the probabilities of ON and OFF states are identified. With
the characterization of the arrival and departure rates at each buffer,
stability conditions are identified and effective capacity analysis is
conducted for both cases to determine the system throughput under statistical
queueing constraints. In addition, for the variable-rate scheme, the concavity
of the sum rate is shown for certain parameters, helping to improve the
efficiency of parameter optimization. Finally, via numerical results, the
influence of system parameters and the behavior of the system throughput are
identified.

of the longitudinal current density to the application of a DC magnetic field.
Such a response function has been shown to be at odds with a general result
showing the vanishing of the bulk current in an equilibrium system on any real
material with a lattice in an external magnetic field. Here we resolve this
apparent contradiction by introducing a model where a current flows in response
to a magnetic field even without Weyl nodes. We point out that the previous
derivation of a vanishing CME in the limit of vanishing real frequency is a
consequence of the assumption of periodic boundary conditions of the system. A
more realistic system with open boundary conditions is not subject to these
constraints and can have a non-vanishing CME. Consistent with recent work, we
found the finite frequency CME to be non-vanishing in general when there was a
non-vanishing Berry curvature on the Fermi surface. This does not necessitate
having a topological Berry flux as in the case of a Weyl node. Finally, we
study how the perturbation theory in magnetic field might be more stable in the
presence of disorder. Using the standard diagrammatic treatment of disorder
within the Born approximation, we have found that in a realistic disordered
system, the chiral magnetic response is really a dynamical phenomena and
vanishes in the DC limit.

relativistic electrons in a magnetic field of 1 mG. If these electrons are

used to infer the effect of an exposure on an outcome using instrumental

are based on fitting a conditional mean model for the exposure, and then using
the fitted exposure values along with the covariates as predictors in a linear
model for the outcome. We show that standard TSLS estimators enjoy greater
robustness to model misspecification than more general two-stage estimators.
However, by potentially using a wrong exposure model, e.g. when the exposure is
binary, they tend to be inefficient. In view of this, we study double-robust
G-estimators instead. These use working models for the exposure, IV and outcome
but only require correct specification of either the IV model or the outcome
model to guarantee consistent estimation of the exposure effect. As the finite
sample performance of the locally efficient G-estimator can be poor, we further
develop G-estimation procedures with improved efficiency and robustness
properties under misspecification of some or all working models. Simulation
studies and a data analysis demonstrate drastic improvements, with remarkably
good performance even when one or more working models are misspecified.

Specifically, they describe a new Markov process which is the Doob h-transform

underlies the Lamperti-Kiu representation of a rssMp. In the same spirit, we
show that the notion of conditioning a rssMp to continuously absorb at the

characterise the stable process conditioned to continuously absorb at the

strong-coupling theory that accurately accounts for the phase diagram at high
pressures, including the tri-crital point and $T_{AB}(p)$ line defining the
region of stability for the bulk A-phase. We also introduce tuneable boundary
conditions that allow us to explore boundary scattering ranging from maximal to
minimal pairbreaking, and report results for the phase diagram as a function of
pressure, temperature, and boundary conditions. Four stable phases are found: a
polar phase stable in the vicinity of $T_c$, a strongly anisotropic,
cylindrical analog of the bulk B phase stable at sufficiently low temperatures,
and two chiral A-like phases with distinctly different orbital symmetry, one of
which spontaneously breaks rotation symmetry about the axis of the cylindrical
channel. The relative stability of these phases depends sensitively on pressure
and the degree of pairbreaking by boundary scattering. The broken symmetries
exhibited by these phases give rise to distinct signatures in transverse NMR
resonance spectroscopy. We present theoretical results for the transverse NMR

disjunction. Such statements are modeled and incorporated in an optimization
problem using Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP). GDP provides a
systematic methodology to model optimization problems involving logic
disjunctions, logic propositions, and algebraic equations. In order to take
advantage of the existing MINLP solvers, GDP problems can be reformulated as
the standard MINLP problems. In this work we propose a novel reformulation
methodology for general GDP problems with nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints. The proposed methodology provides an exact reformulation,
maintains feasibility and convexity of the constraints, and, most importantly,
does not require choosing a tolerance level and a Big-M parameter. We also
demonstrate how the new reformulation approach can be used to convert the logic
proposition represented using if-else (implication) construct into equations in
the standard MINLP format. The conversion methodology is extended for
variations of implication constructs that include implicit else blocks,
sequential implication logic, multiple testing conditions, and nested
implication blocks. The proposed approach is utilized to model physical and
mechanical properties in a mathematical optimization tool that solves an MINLP
problem to design commercial products.

Blue stragglers are easy to identify in globular clusters, but are
much harder to identify in the field. Here we present the serendipitous
discovery of one field blue straggler, HIP 10725, that closely matches the Sun
in mass and age, but with a metallicity slightly lower than the Sun's.
[Methods]. We employ high resolution (R $\sim 10^5$) high S/N (330) VLT/UVES
spectra to perform a differential abundance analysis of the solar analogue HIP
10725. Radial velocities obtained by other instruments were also used to check
for binarity. We also study its chromospheric activity, age and rotational
velocity. [Results]. We find that HIP 10725 is severely depleted in beryllium
([Be/H] <= -1.2 dex) for its stellar parameters and age. The abundances
relative to solar of the elements with Z <= 30 show a correlation with
condensation temperature and the neutron capture elements produced by the
s-process are greatly enhanced, while the r-process elements seem normal. We
found its projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 3.3+/-0.1 km/s) to be
significantly larger than solar, and incompatible with its isochrone-derived
age. Radial velocity monitoring shows that the star has a binary companion.
[Conclusions]. Based on the high s-process element enhancements and low
beryllium abundance, we suggest that HIP 10725 has been polluted by
mass-transfer from an AGB star, probably with initial mass of about 2 M_Sun.
The radial velocity variations suggest the presence of an unseen binary
companion, probably the remnant of a former AGB star. Isochrones predict a
solar-age star, but this is in disagreement with the high projected rotational
velocity and high chromospheric activity. We conclude that HIP 10725 is a field
blue straggler, rejuvenated by the mass transfer process of its former AGB
companion.

experiments at different wavelengths: ARGO-YBJ in TeV $\gamma$-rays,
$Fermi$-LAT in GeV $\gamma$-rays, $Swift$-BAT in hard X-rays, $RXTE$-ASM,
$MAXI$ and $Swift$-XRT in soft X-rays, $Swift$-UVOT in ultraviolet, and OVRO in
radio frequencies. In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and $Fermi$ data, the
whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap.
  According to the observed light curves, ten states (including seven large
flares, two quiescent phases and one outburst) were selected. For the first
time, the multi-wavelength spectral evolutions of Mrk 421 during different
states were systematically analyzed. During the outburst phase and the seven
flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from
sub-keV to few keV. The TeV $\gamma$-ray flux increases up to 0.9$-$7.2 times
the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV $\gamma$-rays is found to vary
depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three
groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the observed radiation
spectra above 0.3 keV of different states can be reasonably described by a
simple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. The underlying physical
mechanisms responsible for different states may be related to the acceleration
process or to variations of the ambient medium.

the dominant process from the amplitude of the phonon oscillation. For short
pulse widths, ISRS is very small and becomes larger as the pulse width
increases. We also show that the initial phase is dependent on the pulse width

directly related to the intercalation energies of Li/Na/Mg in one phase versus

algorithms were established only for tree networks due to the complexity of the

Short-Fat Tree (SFT) algorithm. Loosely speaking, the algorithm selects the
node such that the breadth-first search (BFS) tree from the node has the
minimum depth but the maximum number of leaf nodes. Performance guarantees of
SFT under the independent cascade (IC) model are established for both tree
networks and the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph. On tree networks, SFT is the
maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator. On the ER random graph, the following
fundamental limits have been obtained: $(i)$ when the infection duration
$<\frac{2}{3}t_u,$ SFT identifies the source with probability one
asymptotically, where $t_u=\left\lceil\frac{\log n}{\log \mu}\right\rceil+2$
and $\mu$ is the average node degree, $(ii)$ when the infection duration
$>t_u,$ the probability of identifying the source approaches zero
asymptotically under any algorithm; and $(iii)$ when infection duration $<t_u,$
the BFS tree starting from the source is a fat tree. Numerical experiments on
tree networks, the ER random graphs and real world networks with different

Ia) show unusually low total-to-selective extinction ratio ($R_{V}<2$) and
wavelength of maximum polarization ($\lambda_{max}<0.4\mu m$) for several SNe
Ia, which indicates peculiar properties of interstellar (IS) dust in the SN
hosted galaxies and/or the presence of circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper,
we use inversion technique to infer best-fit grain size distribution and
alignment function of interstellar grains along the lines of sight toward four
SNe Ia with anomalous extinction and polarization data (SNe 1986G, 2006X,
2008fp, and 2014J). We find that to reproduce low values of $R_{V}$, a
significant enhancement in the mass of small grains of radius $a< 0.1\mu m$ is
required. For SN 2014J, a simultaneous fit to observed extinction and
polarization data is unsuccessful if the entire data is attributed to IS dust
(model 1), but a good fit is obtained when accounting for the contribution of
CS dust (model 2). For SN 2008fp, our fitting results for model 1 show that, to
reproduce an extreme value of $\lambda_{\max}\sim 0.15\mu m$, very small
silicate grains must be aligned as efficiently as big grains. We suggest that
tiny grains in the intervening molecular cloud can be aligned efficiently by
radiative torques (RATs) from the SNe Ia. The resulting time dependence
polarization from this RAT alignment model can be tested by observing at
ultraviolet wavelengths. Our results are in favor of the existence of CS dust
in SN 2014J, but its presence in SN 2008fp remains uncertain.

sets of output symbols are simultaneously provided to receivers for recovering
the source data. Each receiver, without the need to send information back to
the sender, is capable of receiving the output symbols generated by some
configuration chosen according to its own decoding phase. Aiming at the
broadcasting scenarios without feedback channels, the proposed MC-LT codes are
shown to outperform the optimal pure LT codes at the cost of encoding and
transmitting units. In this paper, the inspiration of MC-LT codes is presented,
how MC-LT codes work is described by giving examples, in which the optimal pure
LT codes are outperformed, and a practical design of MC-LT codes, which is
analytically proved to have at least the same performance bound as the pure LT
codes, is proposed. The results of numerical simulation experiments demonstrate
that the proposed practical design of MC-LT codes can deliver better
performance than the LT codes in comparison. In summary, this paper creates new
potential research directions for LT codes, and MC-LT codes are a promising
variant of LT codes, especially for broadcasting scenarios.

parameter does not suffice to characterize the order, and it is necessary to

the long-wavelength Fourier components of the density profile. We study both
static and dynamic scaling laws obeyed by the Fourier modes $Q_m$ and find that
the mean value obeys the static scaling law $\langle Q_m \rangle \sim
L^{-\phi}f(m/L)$ with $\phi\simeq2/3$ and $\phi \simeq 3/5$ with
Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) surface evolution
respectively. The full probability distribution $P(Q_m)$ exhibits scaling as
well. Further, time-dependent correlation functions such as the steady state
auto-correlation and cross-correlations of order parameter components are
scaling functions of $t/L^z$, where $L$ is the system size and $z$ is the
dynamic exponent with $z=2$ for EW and $z=3/2$ for KPZ surface evolution. In
addition we find that the CD model shows temporal intermittency, manifested in
the dynamical structure functions of the density and a weak divergence of the
flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.

work in \cite{kwak2010analysis} where `broken' $P_1$ nonconforming element of
Crouzeix-Raviart \cite{crouzeix1973conforming} was developed.
  For the Darcy velocity, we apply the mixed finite volume method studied in
\cite{chou2003mixed, kwak2010analysis} on the basis of immersed finite element
method (IFEM). In this way, the Darcy velocity of the flow can be computed
cheaply (locally) after we solve the pressure equation. The computed Darcy
velocity is used to solve the saturation equation explicitly. Thus the whole
procedure can be implemented in an efficient way using a structured grid which
is independent of the underlying heterogeneous porous media. Numerical results
show that our method exhibits optimal order convergence rates for the pressure
and velocity variables, and suboptimal rate for saturation.

The source AR consists of pre-existing sigmoidal structure stacked over a
filament channel which is regarded as MFR system. EUV observations of low
corona suggest a further development of this MFR system by added axial flux
through tether-cutting reconnection of loops at the middle of sigmoid under the
influence of continuous slow flux motions during past two days. Our study
implies that the MFR system in the AR is initiated to upward motion by
kink-instability and further driven by torus-instability. The CME morphology,
captured in simultaneous three-point coronagraph observations, is fitted with
Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model and discerns an MFR topology with
orientation aligning with magnetic neutral line in the source AR. This MFR
expands self-similarly and is found to have source AR twist signatures in the
associated near Earth magnetic cloud (MC). We further derived kinematics of
this CME propagation by employing a plethora of stereoscopic as well as single
spacecraft reconstruction techniques. While stereoscopic methods perform
relatively poorly compared to other methods, fitting methods worked best in
estimating the arrival time of the CME compared to in-situ measurements.
Supplied with values of constrained solar wind velocity, drag parameter and 3D

designed to address some key limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One
of its main features is in-network content caching, which allows requests for
content to be served by routers. Despite improved bandwidth utilization and
lower latency for popular content retrieval, in-network content caching offers
producers no means of collecting information about content that is requested

accounting purposes. In this paper, we design some secure accounting schemes
that vary in the degree of consumer, router, and producer involvement. Next, we
identify and analyze performance and security tradeoffs, and show that specific
per-consumer accounting is impossible in the presence of router caches and
without application-specific support. We then recommend accounting strategies
that entail a few simple requirements for CCN architectures. Finally, our
experimental results show that forms of native and secure CCN accounting are
both more viable and practical than application-specific approaches with little

shapes. Gravitational microlensing can magnify these signals and make them be
resolved. The main aim of this work is to determine what extra information
about these disks can be extracted from polarimetry observations of
microlensing events in addition to those given by photometry ones. Hot disks
which are closer to their host stars are more likely to be detected by
microlensing, owing to more contributions in the total flux. By considering
this kind of disks, we show that although the polarimetric efficiency for
detecting disks is similar to the photometric observation, but polarimetry
observations can help to constraint the disk geometrical parameters e.g. the
disk inner radius and the lens trajectory with respect to the disk semimajor
axis. On the other hand, the time scale of polarimetric curves of these
microlensing events generally increases while their photometric time scale does
not change. By performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that almost 4
optically-thin disks around the Galactic bulge sources are detected (or even

discussed the influence of weak dispersive interactions on structural and
vibrational properties through the DFT-D2 method. We find anisotropic
compressibility (b $<$ a $<$ c) from pressure dependent structural properties.
The predicted bulk modulus reveals that the material is harder than cyanuric
triazide (\ce{C3N12}) and softer than lead azide (\ce{Pb(N3)2}). A complete
assignment of all vibrational modes has been made and compared with the
available experimental results. The calculated zone centre IR and Raman
frequencies show a blue-shift which leads to a hardening of the lattice upon
compression. In addition, we have also calculated the electronic structure and
absorption spectra using the recently developed Tran Blaha-modified Becke
Johnson potential. It is found that K$_2$DNABT is a direct band gap insulator
with a band gap of 3.87 eV and the top of the valence band mainly dominated by
$2p$-states of oxygen and nitrogen atoms. K$_2$DNABT exhibits mixed ionic
(between potassium and tetrazolate ions) and covalent character within
tetrazolate molecule. The presence of ionic bonding suggests that the
investigated compound is relatively stable and insensitive than covalent
primaries. From the calculated absorption spectra, the material is found to
decompose under ultra-violet light irradiation.

basic electronic structure reveals a drastic difference between the $3d$
orbitals of $E_g$ and $T_{2g}$ symmetries. The latter ones define the shape of
the Fermi surface, while the former ones form weakly-interacting impurity
levels. We demonstrate that, as a result of this, in Fe the $T_{2g}$ orbitals
participate in exchange interactions, which are only weakly dependent on the
configuration of the spin moments and thus can be classified as
Heisenberg-like. These couplings are shown to be driven by Fermi surface
nesting. In contrast, for the $E_g$ states the Heisenberg picture breaks down,
since the corresponding contribution to the exchange interactions is shown to
strongly depend on the reference state they are extracted from. Our analysis of
the nearest-neighbour coupling indicates that the interactions among $E_g$
states are mainly proportional to the corresponding hopping integral and thus
can be attributed to be of double-exchange origin.

convergence analysis of SPDEs with the noise terms replaced by the projected

operator-dependent conditions. These SPDEs with projected noises are then
numerically approximated with the finite element method. A general error

on this framework, optimal error estimates of finite element approximations for

observations of an M1.1 flare obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope.
The temporal evolution of the Halpha line profiles from the flare kernel shows
excess emission in the red wing (red asymmetry) before flare maximum, and
excess in the blue wing (blue asymmetry) after maximum. However, the Ca II 8542
{\AA} line does not follow the same pattern, showing only a weak red asymmetry
during the flare. RADYN simulations are used to synthesise spectral line
profiles for the flaring atmosphere, and good agreement is found with the
observations. We show that the red asymmetry observed in Halpha is not
necessarily associated with plasma downflows, and the blue asymmetry may not be
related to plasma upflows. Indeed, we conclude that the steep velocity
gradients in the flaring chromosphere modifies the wavelength of the central
reversal in the Halpha line profile. The shift in the wavelength of maximum
opacity to shorter and longer wavelengths generates the red and blue
asymmetries, respectively.

larger than what is predicted by analytical models, but these models fall

mitigation of Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) is demonstrated on the ASDEX Upgrade
tokamak. The plasma is refuelled by injection of frozen deuterium pellets and
ELMs are mitigated by external resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs). In this
experiment relevant dimensionless parameters, such as relative pellet size,
relative RMP amplitude and pedestal collisionality are kept at the ITER like
values. Refuelling of density pump out requires a factor of two increase of
nominal fuelling rate. Energy confinement and pedestal temperatures are not
restored to pre-RMP values by pellet refuelling.

Atherosclerosis emerges from the combination of many dynamical factors,

biochemistry. Despite its significance to public health, the dynamics that
drive atherosclerosis remain poorly understood. As a disease that depends on
multiple factors operating on different length scales, the natural framework to
apply to atherosclerosis is mathematical and computational modelling. A
computational model provides an integrated description of the disease and
serves as an in silico experimental system from which we can learn about the
disease and develop therapeutic hypotheses. Although the work completed in this
area to-date has been limited, there are clear signs that interest is growing
and that a nascent field is establishing itself. This paper discusses the
current state of modelling in this area, bringing together many recent results

remnants (SNRs) and is in continuing debates on its hadronic versus leptonic
origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. We explore the role played by the
diffusive relativistic protons that escape from the SNR shock wave in the
$\gamma$-ray emission, apart from the high-energy particles' emission from the
inside of the SNR. In the scenario that the SNR shock propagates in a clumpy
molecular cavity, we consider that the$\gamma$-ray emission from the inside of
the SNR may arise either from the inverse Compton scattering or from the
interaction between the trapped energetic protons and the shocked clumps. The
dominant origin between them depends on the electron-to-proton number ratio.
The diffusive protons that escaped from the shock wave during the expansion
history can provide an outer hadronic $\gamma$-ray component by bombarding the
surrounding dense matter. The broadband spectrum can be well explained by this
two-zone model, in which the $\gamma$-ray emission from the inside governs the
TeV band, while the outer emission component substantially contributes to the
GeV $\gamma$-rays. The two-zone model can also explain the TeV $\gamma$-ray
radial brightness profile that significantly stretches beyond the nonthermal
X-ray-emitting region. In the calculation, we present a simplified algorithm
for Li & Chen's (2010) ""accumulative diffusion"" model for escaping protons and

magnetization $M_S$, Gilbert damping $\alpha$, and exchange stiffness $A$.
$M_S$ and $A$ are shown to have a maximum for stoichiometric composition, while
the Gilbert damping is minimum. We find excellent quantitative agreement
between theory and experiment for $M_S$ and $\alpha$. The calculated $A$ shows
the same trend as the experimental data, but has a larger magnitude.
Additionally to the unique in-plane anisotropy of the material, these
tunabilities of the magnetodynamic properties can be taken advantage of when
employing NiMnSb films in magnonic devices.

of a local fluctuation theorem about the exchange of excitations between a

Category Theorem in the Weihrauch lattice. The Baire Category Theorem can be
seen as a pigeonhole principle that states that a complete (i.e., ""large"")
metric space cannot be decomposed into countably many nowhere dense (i.e.,
""small"") pieces. The Baire Category Theorem is an illuminating example of a
theorem that can be used to demonstrate that one classical theorem can have
several different computational interpretations. For one, we distinguish two
different logical versions of the theorem, where one can be seen as the
contrapositive form of the other one. The first version aims to find an
uncovered point in the space, given a sequence of nowhere dense closed sets.
The second version aims to find the index of a closed set that is somewhere
dense, given a sequence of closed sets that cover the space. Even though the
two statements behind these versions are equivalent to each other in classical
logic, they are not equivalent in intuitionistic logic and likewise they
exhibit different computational behavior in the Weihrauch lattice. Besides this
logical distinction, we also consider different ways how the sequence of closed
sets is ""given"". Essentially, we can distinguish between positive and negative
information on closed sets. We discuss all the four resulting versions of the
Baire Category Theorem. Somewhat surprisingly it turns out that the difference
in providing the input information can also be expressed with the jump
operation. Finally, we also relate the Baire Category Theorem to notions of
genericity and computably comeager sets.

Anisotropies after recombination. Being almost frozen in the Hubble flow, these
strings are quasi static and evade almost all of the previously derived
constraints on their tension while being able to source large scale
anisotropies in the CMB sky. Using a local variance estimator on thousand of
numerically simulated Nambu-Goto all sky maps, we compute the expected signal

being negligible at small angles. Interestingly, such a scenario generically
produces one cold spot from the thawing of a cosmic string loop. Mixed with
anisotropies of inflationary origin, we find that a few strings of tension GU =

absorption of single photons leads to an acceleration of atomic dynamics at
fluences before macroscopic effects due to sample heating set in. Second, a

superconductor, Sr/ammonia-intercalated FeSe, have been measured using pulsed
magnetic fields down to $4.\,\rm {K}$ and muon spin spectroscopy down to
$1.5\,\rm K$. This compound exhibits intrinsic disorder resulting from random
stacking of the FeSe layers along the $c$-axis that is not present in other
intercalates of the same family. This arises because the coordination
requirements of the intercalated Sr and ammonia moieties imply that the
interlayer stacking (along $c$) involves a translation of either ${\bf a}/2$ or
${\bf b}/2$ which locally breaks tetragonal symmetry. The result of this
stacking arrangement is that the Fe ions in this compound describe a
body-centred tetragonal lattice in contrast to the primitive arrangement of Fe
ions described in all other Fe-based superconductors. In pulsed magnetic fields
the upper critical field $H_{\text{c2}}$ was found to increase on cooling with
an upwards curvature that is commonly seen in type-II superconductors of a
multi-band nature. Fitting the data to a two-band model and extrapolation to
absolute zero gave a maximum upper critical field ${\mu_0H_{\rm c2}(0)}$ of
${33(2)\,\rm T}$. A clear superconducting transition with a diamagnetic shift
was also observed in transverse-field muon measurements at ${T_{\text

superconductivity in these intercalated FeSe systems does not rely on perfect
structural coherence along the $c$-axis.

space of Loop Quantum Gravity was set up with the help a projective formalism
introduced by Kijowski [Kijowski 1977; see also: arXiv:1304.6330,
arXiv:1411.3590]. The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced
treatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes).
Indeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations
on top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a
`no-geometry' state): in such states, most holonomies are totally spread,
making it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4-geometry. However,
going beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers
a deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect
to a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in
the case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic
implications for other gauge groups, eg. $\mathcal{SU}(2)$). Specifically, we
show that, in this case, there does not exist any state on the holonomy-flux
algebra in which the variances of the holonomies and fluxes observables would
all be finite, let alone small. It is important to note that this obstruction
cannot be bypassed by further enlarging the quantum state space, for it arises
from the structure of the algebra itself: as there are too many (uncountably
many) non-vanishing commutators between the holonomy and flux operators, the
corresponding Heisenberg inequalities force the quantum uncertainties to blow
up uncontrollably. A way out would be to suitably restrict the algebra of
observables. In a companion paper we take the first steps in this direction by
developing a general framework to perform such a restriction without giving up
the universality and diffeomorphism invariance of the theory.

Hilbert space, it has been proposed by Kijowski [Kijowski 1977] to represent
quantum states as projective families of density matrices over a collection of
smaller, simpler Hilbert spaces. One can thus bypass the need to select a
vacuum state for the theory, and still be provided with an explicit and
constructive description of the quantum state space, at least as long as the
label set indexing the projective structure is countable. Because uncountable
label sets are much less practical in this context, we develop in the present
article a general procedure to trim an originally uncountable label set down to
countable cardinality. In particular, we investigate how to perform this
tightening of the label set in a way that preserves both the physical content
of the algebra of observables and its symmetries. This work is notably
motivated by applications to the holonomy-flux algebra underlying Loop Quantum
Gravity. Building on earlier work by Okolow [arXiv:1304.6330], a projective
state space was introduced for this algebra in [arXiv:1411.3592]. However, the
non-trivial structure of the holonomy-flux algebra prevents the construction of
satisfactory semi-classical states. Implementing the general procedure just
mentioned in the case of a one-dimensional version of this algebra, we show how
a discrete subalgebra can be extracted without destroying universality nor
diffeomorphism invariance. On this subalgebra, states can then be constructed
whose semi-classicality is enforced step by step, starting from collective,
macroscopic degrees of freedom and going down progressively toward smaller and
smaller scales.

consistent with the idea that the evolving SN with recombining hydrogen

Here, we report a systematic investigation of the dielectric breakdown
characteristics of BN using conductive atomic force microscopy. The electric
field strength was found to be ~12 MV/cm, which is comparable to that of
conventional SiO2 oxides because of the covalent bonding nature of BN. After
the hard dielectric breakdown, the BN fractured like a flower into equilateral
triangle fragments. However, when the applied voltage was terminated precisely
in the middle of the dielectric breakdown, the formation of a hole that did not
penetrate to the bottom metal electrode was clearly observed. Subsequent I-V
measurements of the hole indicated that the BN layer remaining in the hole was
still electrically inactive. Based on these observations, layer-by-layer
breakdown was confirmed for BN with regard to both physical fracture and
electrical breakdown. Moreover, statistical analysis of the breakdown voltages
using a Weibull plot suggested the anisotropic formation of defects. These
results are unique to layered materials and unlike the behavior observed for

redshift can be used to test our current understanding of galaxy formation and
evolution. Aims: We want to reveal the fuel and triggering mechanism for star
formation in these otherwise passively evolving red and dead stellar systems.
Methods: We undertook an optical and ultraviolet study of 55 star forming blue
early-type galaxies, searching for signatures of recent interactions that could
be driving the molecular gas into the galaxy and potentially triggering the
star formation. Results: We report here our results on star forming blue
early-type galaxies with tidal trails and in close proximity to neighbouring
galaxies that are evidence of ongoing or recent interactions between galaxies.
There are 12 galaxies with close companions with similar redshifts, among which
two galaxies are having ongoing interactions that potentially trigger the star
formation. Two galaxies show a jet feature that could be due to the complete
tidal disruption of the companion galaxy. The interacting galaxies have high
star formation rates and very blue optical colours. Galaxies with no companion
could have undergone a minor merger in the recent past. Conclusions: The recent
or ongoing interaction with a gas-rich neighbouring galaxy could be responsible
for bringing cold gas to an otherwise passively evolving early-type galaxy. The
sudden gas supply could trigger the star formation, eventually creating a blue
early-type galaxy. The galaxies with ongoing tidal interaction are blue and
star forming, thereby implying that blue early-type galaxies can exist even
when the companion is on flyby so does not end up in a merger.

  Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous sources found in nature. They are
associated with the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found in and
near distant galaxies. Since they are viable indicators of the dense part of
the Universe containing normal matter, the spatial distribution of gamma-ray
bursts can serve as tracers of Universal large-scale structure.
  An increased sample size of gamma-ray bursts with known redshift provides us
with the opportunity to validate or invalidate the existence of the

the larger sample for evidence of clustering and a bootstrap point-radius
method is used to estimate the angular cluster size. The potential influence of
angular sampling biasing is studied to determine the viability of the results.
  The larger gamma-ray burst database further supports the existence of a
statistically significant gamma-ray burst cluster at 1.6 < z < 2.1 with an
estimated angular size of 2000-3000 Mpc.
  Although small number statistics limit our angular resolution and do not rule
out the existence of adjacent and/or line-of-sight smaller structures, these

elegant method to determine distances of pulsating stars in a quasi-geometrical
way. However, these classical implementations in general only use a subset of
the available observational data. Freedman & Madore (2010) suggested a more
physical approach in the implementation of the parallax of pulsation in order
to treat all available data. We present a global and model-based
parallax-of-pulsation method that enables including any type of observational
data in a consistent model fit, the SpectroPhoto-Interferometric modeling of
Pulsating Stars (SPIPS). We implemented a simple model consisting of a
pulsating sphere with a varying effective temperature and a combina- tion of

and interferometric angular diameters. We also parametrized (and adjusted) the
reddening and the contribution of the circumstellar envelopes in the
near-infrared photometric and interferometric measurements. We show the
successful application of the method to two stars: delta Cep and eta Aql. The
agreement of all data fitted by a single model confirms the validity of the
method. Derived parameters are compatible with publish values, but with a
higher level of confidence. The SPIPS algorithm combines all the available
observables (radial velocimetry, interferometry, and photometry) to estimate
the physical parameters of the star (ratio distance/ p-factor, Teff, presence
of infrared excess, color excess, etc). The statistical precision is improved
(compared to other methods) thanks to the large number of data taken into

The effect of accurate localization and high temporal resolution on data

  Materials and Methods To achieve high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a
temporal resolution of 6 s, a custom-built calf coil array was used at 7T. The
kinetics of phosphocreatine (PCr) and intracellular pH were quantified
separately in SOL and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle of 9 volunteers,
during rest, plantar flexion exercise and recovery.
  Results
  The average SNR of PCr at rest was 64$\pm$15 in SOL (83$\pm$12 in GM). End
exercise PCr depletion in SOL (19$\pm$9%) was far lower than in GM
(74$\pm$14%). pH in SOL increased rapidly and, in contrast to GM, remained
elevated until the end of exercise.
  Conclusion $^{31}$P MRS in single-shots every 6 s localized in the deeper
lying SOL enabled quantification of PCr recovery times at low depletions and of
fast pH changes, like the initial rise. Both high temporal resolution and
accurate spatial localization improve specificity of Pi and thus pH
quantification by avoiding multiple, and potentially indistinguishable sources

  A. Nota",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stellar content of young massive star clusters emit large amounts of
Lyman continuum photons and inject momentum into the inter stellar medium (ISM)
by the strong stellar winds of the most massive stars in the cluster. When the
most massive stars explode as supernovae, large amounts of mechanical energy
are injected in the ISM. A detailed study of the ISM around these massive
cluster provides insights on the effect of cluster feedback. We present high
quality integral field spectroscopy taken with VLT/MUSE of two starburst
galaxies: ESO 338-IG04 and Haro 11. Both galaxies contain a significant number
of super star clusters. The MUSE data provide us with an unprecedented view of
the state and kinematics of the ionized gas in the galaxy allowing us to study
the effect of stellar feedback on small and large spatial scales. We present
our recent results on studying the ISM state of these two galaxies. The data of
both galaxies show that the mechanical and ionization feedback of the super
star clusters in the galaxy modify the state and kinematics of the ISM
substancially by creating highly ionized bubbles around the cluster, making the
central part of the galaxy highly ionized. This shows that the HII regions
around the individual clusters are density bounded, allowing the ionizing
photons to escape and ionize the ISM further out.

present for modes whose frequency touches the continuum, whereas a radial

system (MAS), consisting of N different continuous-time linear dynamical
systems. For achieving output consensus, a virtual reference model is assumed
to generate the desired trajectory that the MAS is required to track and
synchronize. A distinct feature of our results lies in the local optimality and
robustness achieved by our proposed consensus control algorithm. In addition
our study is focused on the case when the available output measurements contain
only relative information from the neighboring agents and reference signal.
Indeed by exploiting properties of strictly positive real (SPR) transfer
matrices, conditions are derived for the existence of distributed output
feedback control protocols, and solutions are proposed to synthesize the
stabilizing and consensus control protocol over a given connected digraph. It
is shown that design techniques based on the LQG, LQG/LTR and H-infinity loop
shaping can all be directly applied to synthesize the consensus output feedback
control protocol, thereby ensuring the local optimality and stability
robustness. Finally the reference trajectory is required to be transmitted to
only one or a few agents and no local reference models are employed in the
feedback controllers thereby eliminating synchronization of the local reference
models. Our results complement the existing ones, and are illustrated by a
numerical example.

solution of the nonlinear filtering problem in continuous time. The algorithm
implements a feedback control law for a system of particles such that the
empirical distribution of particles approximates the posterior distribution.
However, it has been noted in the literature that the feedback control law is
not unique. To find a unique control law, the filtering task is formulated here
as an optimal transportation problem between the prior and the posterior
distributions. Based on this formulation, a time stepping optimization
procedure is proposed for the optimal control design. A key difference between
the optimal control law and the one in the original FPF, is the replacement of
noise term with a deterministic term. This difference serves to decreases the
simulation variance, as illustrated with a simple numerical example.

grains and intergranular phases, which is used for theoretical simulations, has
been derived from a detailed nanoanalytical TEM/STEM study of a Dy/Tb free
magnet and a high coercive (Nd,Tb)-Fe-B magnet. Special attention is laid on
the EELS analysis of GB with a thickness ranging from 2 - 30 nm. This analysis
identified the majority of the GB phases to have about 50 -70 at.% of iron and
only a few GBs, which are connecting two nearby grain boundary junctions (GBj),
possess a similar chemical composition as the adjacent GBj with a low iron
content (< 10 at. %) and a high rare earth and oxygen content. Finite element
micromagnetic simulations have been carried out in order to study the influence
of internal demagnetizing fields determined by the microstructure on the
magnetization switching behaviour. Special emphasis was put on the influence of
the GB and their magnetic properties, due to their substantial influence on the
nucleation of reverse magnetic domains and the pinning of domain walls. The
strongest reduction of the coercive field is caused by GB with soft
ferromagnetic properties. Shielding the Nd-Fe-B grains from the nucleation
sites at the GBj with Dy or Tb shells, leads to an increase of the coercivity
from 2.5 to 3.6 T and 2.5 to 4.3 T, respectively.

acquire sufficient gas through minor mergers (stellar mass ratios ~4-100) to
sustain their star formation rates at z~2. The relative fraction of the gas
accreted through minor mergers declines with increasing stellar mass and for
the most massive galaxies considered, log M_star (M_sun)=10.5-11, this
accretion rate is insufficient to sustain their star formation. We checked our
minor merger hypothesis at z=0 using the same methodology but now with
relations for local normal galaxies and find that minor mergers cannot account
for their specific growth rates, in agreement with observations of HI-rich
satellites around nearby spirals. We discuss a number of attractive features,
like a natural down-sizing effect, in using minor mergers with extended HI
disks to support star formation at high redshift. The answer to the question
posed by the title, ""Can galaxy growth be sustained through \HI-rich minor

cosmological probes of structure formation. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of the relation between two profile observables,
concentration ($\mathrm{c_{vir}}$) and mass ($\mathrm{M_{vir}}$). We have
collected the largest known sample of measurements from the literature which
make use of one or more of the following reconstruction techniques: Weak
gravitational lensing (WL), strong gravitational lensing (SL), Weak+Strong
Lensing (WL+SL), the Caustic Method (CM), Line-of-sight Velocity Dispersion
(LOSVD), and X-ray. We find that the concentration-mass (c-M) relation is
highly variable depending upon the reconstruction technique used. We also find
concentrations derived from dark matter only simulations (at approximately
$\mathrm{M_{vir} \sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}}$) to be inconsistent with the WL and
WL+SL relations at the $\mathrm{1\sigma}$ level, even after the projection of
triaxial halos is taken into account. However, to fully determine consistency
between simulations and observations, a volume-limited sample of clusters is
required, as selection effects become increasingly more important in answering
this. Interestingly, we also find evidence for a steeper WL+SL relation as
compared to WL alone, a result which could perhaps be caused by the varying
shape of cluster isodensities, though most likely reflects differences in
selection effects caused by these two techniques. Lastly, we compare
concentration and mass measurements of individual clusters made using more than
one technique, highlighting the magnitude of the potential bias which could
exist in such observational samples.

study the influence of stellar companions by measuring the stellar multiplicity
rate of MTPS. We select 138 bright (KP < 13.5) Kepler MTPS and search for
stellar companions with AO imaging data and archival radial velocity (RV) data.
We obtain new AO images for 73 MTPS. Other MTPS in the sample have archival AO
imaging data from the Kepler Community Follow-up Observation Program (CFOP).
From these imaging data, we detect 42 stellar companions around 35 host stars.
For stellar separation 1 AU < a < 100 AU, the stellar multiplicity rate is 5.2
$\pm$ 5.0% for MTPS, which is 2.8{\sigma} lower than 21.1 $\pm$ 2.8% for the
control sample, i.e., the field stars in the solar neighborhood. We identify
two origins for the deficit of stellar companions within 100 AU to MTPS: (1) a
suppressive planet formation, and (2) the disruption of orbital coplanarity due
to stellar companions. To distinguish between the two origins, we compare the
stellar multiplicity rates of MTPS and single transiting planet systems (STPS).
However, current data are not sufficient for this purpose. For 100 AU < a <
2000 AU, the stellar multiplicity rates are comparable for MTPS (8.0 $\pm$

event model in a Bayesian filtering framework. Our main contribution is the
design of the likelihood function used in the filter to process the observed

evidence of the Gaussian-like distribution of spiked events with respect to the

  temperature","accepted in Solar Physics",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solar flares result in an increase of the solar irradiance at all
wavelengths. While the distribution of the flare fluence observed in coronal
emission has been widely studied and found to scale as f(E) ~ E^{-\alpha}, with
\alpha slightly below 2, the distribution of the flare fluence in chromospheric
lines is poorly known. We used the solar irradiance measurements observed by
the SDO/EVE instrument at a 10s-cadence to investigate if there is a dependency
of the scaling exponent on the formation region of the lines (or temperature).
We analyzed all flares above the C1 level since the start of the EVE
observation (May 2010) to determine the flare fluence distribution in 16 lines
covering a large range of temperature, several of which were not studied
before. Our results show a small downward trend with the temperature of the
scaling exponent of the PDF, going from above 2 at lower temperature (a few
10^4 K) to about1.8 for hot coronal emission (several 10^6 K). However, because
colder lines also have smaller contrast, we could not exclude that this
behavior is caused by including more noise for smaller flare for these lines.
We discuss the method and its limits and tentatively associate this possible
trend to the different mechanisms responsible for the heating of the
chromosphere and corona during flares.

inclination of $75\pm\,3^{\circ}$ with a position angle on the sky of
$110\pm\,8^{\circ}$ measured E from N. From the best-fit disk density model, we
find that 90\% of the H$\alpha$ emission arises from within $9.5$ stellar
radii, and the mass associated with this H$\alpha$ disk is $\sim
1.8\times10^{-10}$ of the stellar mass and the associated angular momentum,
assuming Keplerian rotation for the disk, is $\sim 1.6\times10^{-8}$ of the
total stellar angular momentum. The occurrence of a central quasi-emission
(CQE) feature in Mg\,{\sc ii} $\lambda\,4481$ is also predicted by this
best-fit disk model and the computed profile compares successfully with
observations from 1999. To obtain consistency between the H$\alpha$ line
profile modelling and the other constraints, it was necessary in the profile
fitting to weight the line core (emission peaks and central depression) more
heavily than the line wings, which were not well reproduced by our models. This
may reflect the limitation of assuming a single power-law for the disk's
equatorial density variation. The best-fit disk density model for $o$~Aqr
predicts that H$\alpha$ is near its maximum strength as a function of disk
density, and hence the H$\alpha$ equivalent width and line profile change only
weakly in response to large (factor of $\sim 5$) changes in the disk density.

instabilities. There are at least four natural effects that cause deviations
from ideal power law size distributions, which we model here in a generalized
way: (1) a physical threshold of an instability; (2) incomplete sampling of the
smallest events below a threshold $x_0$; (3) contamination by an
event-unrelated background $x_b$; and (4) truncation effects at the largest
events due to a finite system size. These effects can be modeled in simplest
terms with a ""thresholded power law"" distribution function (also called
generalized Pareto [type II] or Lomax distribution), $N(x) dx \propto
(x+x_0)^{-a} dx$, where $x_0 > 0$ is positive for a threshold effect, while
$x_0 < 0$ is negative for background contamination. We analytically derive the
functional shape of this thresholded power law distribution function from an
exponential-growth evolution model, which produces avalanches only when a
disturbance exceeds a critical threshold $x_0$. We apply the thresholded power
law distribution function to terrestrial, solar (HXRBS, BATSE, RHESSI), and
stellar flare (Kepler) data sets. We find that the thresholded power law model
provides an adequate fit to most of the observed data. Major advantages of this
model are the automated choice of the power law fitting range, diagnostics of
background contamination, physical inastability thresholds, instrumental
detection thresholds, and finite system size limits. When testing
self-organized criticality models, which predict ideal power laws, we suggest
to include these natural truncation effects.

amplitude transitions between its states. Such transitions occur in supernovae
and compact object mergers due to turbulent matter profiles and neutrino
self-interactions. In this paper we study, both numerically and analytically,
three-flavour neutrino transformation through fluctuating matter built from two
and three Fourier modes. We find flavor transformation effects which cannot
occur with just two flavours. For the case of two Fourier modes we observe the
equivalent of ""induced transparency"" from quantum optics whereby transitions
between a given pair of states are suppressed due to the presence of a resonant
mode between another pair. When we add a third Fourier mode we find a new
effect whereby the third mode can manipulate the transition probabilities of
the two mode case so as to force complete transparency or, alternatively,
restore ""opacity"" meaning the perturbative Hamiltonian regains its ability to
induce neutrino flavour transitions. In both applications we find analytic
solutions are able to match the amplitude and wavenumber of the numerical
results to within a few percent. We then consider a case of turbulence and show
how the theory can be used to understand the very different response of a
neutrino to what appears to be two, almost identical, instances of turbulence.

Simplified Model Spectra (SMS), containing only a few new particles with fixed
decay branching ratios, yielding generic upper limits on the cross section as a
function of particle masses. The interpretation of these limits within
realistic BSM scenarios is non-trivial and best done by automated computational
tools. To this end we have developed SModelS, a public tool that can test any
given BSM model with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry by decomposing it into its SMS
components and confronting them with a large database of SMS results. This
allows to easily evaluate the main LHC constraints on the model. Additionally,
SModelS returns information on important signatures that are not covered by the
existing SMS results. This may be used to improve the coverage of BSM searches
and SMS interpretations. We present the working principle of SModelS, in
particular the decomposition procedure, the database and matching of applicable
experimental results. Moreover, we present applications of SModelS to different
models: the MSSM, a model with a sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric
particle and the UMSSM. These results illustrate how SModelS can be used to
identify important constraints, untested regions and interesting new
signatures.

0716+714, during its outburst state from 2014 November - 2015 March. We took
data on 23 nights at three observatories, one in India and two in Bulgaria,
making quasi-simultaneous observations in B, V, R, and I bands. We measured
multi-band optical fluxes, colour and spectral variations for this blazar on
intraday and short timescales. The source was in a flaring state during the
period analyzed and displayed intense variability in all wavelengths. R band
magnitude of 11.6 was attained by the target on 18 Jan 2015, which is the
brightest value ever recorded for S5 0716+714. The discrete correlation
function method yielded good correlation between the bands with no measurable
time lags, implying that radiation in these bands originate from the same
region and by the same mechanism. We also used the structure function technique
to look for characteristic timescales in the light curves. During the times of
rapid variability, no evidence for the source to display spectral changes with
magnitude was found on either of the timescales. The amplitude of variations
tends to increase with increasing frequency with a maximum of $\sim$ 22% seen
during flaring states in B band. A mild trend of larger variability amplitude
as the source brightens was also found. We found the duty cycle of our source
during the analyzed period to be $\sim$ 90%. We also investigated the optical
spectral energy distribution of S5 0716+714 using B, V, R, and I data points
for 21 nights. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms most likely responsible
for its flux and spectral variations.

PKS 2155-304, made on 24 May 2002 in the 0.3 - 10 keV X-ray band. These
observations display a mini-flare, a nearly constant flux period and a strong
flux increase. We performed a time-resolved spectral study of the data, by
dividing the data into eight segments. We fitted the data with a power-law and
a broken power-law model, and in some of the segments we found a noticeable
spectral flattening of the source's spectrum below 10 keV. We also performed
time-resolved cross-correlation analyses and detected significant hard and soft
lags (for the first time in a single observation of this source) during the
first and last parts of the observation, respectively. Our analysis of the
spectra, the variations of photon-index with flux as well as the correlation
and lags between the harder and softer X-ray bands indicate that both the
particle acceleration and synchrotron cooling processes make an important
contribution to the emission from this blazar. The hard lags indicate a
variable acceleration process. We also estimated the magnetic field value using
the soft lags. The value of the magnetic field is consistent with the values
derived from the broad-band SED modeling of this source.

nonsmooth and multidomain dynamics is developed. The solid is discretised into
pseudo-particles using the meshfree moving least squares method. The particles
carry strain and stress tensor variables that are mapped to deformation
constraints and constraint forces. The discretised solid model thus fit a
unified framework for nonsmooth multidomain dynamics for realtime simulations
including strong coupling of rigid multibodies with complex kinematic
constraints such as articulation joints, unilateral contacts with dry friction,
drivelines and hydraulics. The nonsmooth formulation allow for impulses, due to
impacts for instance, to propagate instantly between the rigid multibody and
the solid. Plasticity is introduced through an associative perfectly plastic
modified Drucker-Prager model. The elastic and plastic dynamics is verified for
simple test systems and the capability of simulating tracked terrain vehicles
driving on a deformable terrain is demonstrated.
