dimensions under the influence of a spatially varying perpendicular magnetic
field. In the quantum limit they are protected edge modes that separate
topologically inequivalent ground states and can also occur when the particle
density rather than the field is made nonuniform. We examine the correspondence
of snake trajectories in single-layer graphene in the quantum limit for two
families of domain walls: (a) a uniform doped carrier density in an
antisymmetric field profile and (b) antisymmetric carrier distribution in a
uniform field. These families support different internal symmetries but the
same pattern of boundary and interface currents. We demonstrate that these
physically different situations are gauge equivalent when rewritten in a Nambu
doubled formulation of the two limiting problems. Using gauge transformations
in particle-hole space to connect these problems, we map the protected
interfacial modes to the Bogoliubov quasiparticles of an interfacial
one-dimensional p-wave paired state. A variational model is introduced to
interpret the interfacial solutions of both domain wall problems.

  Crystals","16 pages and 10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  X-ray scattering and polarized microscopic studies of the structure and order
parameters in the nematic (N) and heliconical, or the twist-bend nematic (Ntb),
phase have been performed as a function of temperature. The nematic
orientational order parameters <P2(cos{\theta})> and <P4(cos{\theta})> in the
nematic phases of CB7CB and its mixtures with less than 20 wt% CB6CB reveal
that they both increase with decreasing temperature in the N phase. Both order
parameters decrease upon entering the Ntb phase and <P4(cos{\theta})> becomes
negative providing a direct confirmation of the conical molecular orientational
distribution. The heliconical tilt angle, estimated from the orientational
distribution functions (ODFs), in all cases increases from zero at the N - Ntb
transition to approximately 27{\deg} at about 40 K below the transition, in
excellent agreement with freeze fracture transmission electron microscopy
results of Chen and the birefringence results of Meyer. The growth of the tilt
angle in the Ntb phase follows a single power law with exponents between ~0.09
+/- 0.01 to -0.12 +/- 0.01, which is far from the expected tricritical or mean
field exponents of 0.25 or 0.5. The temperature dependence of the tilt angle
calculated from the ODFs also is in good qualitative agreement with the values
estimated from optical studies of their ropelike textures within adjacent
blocks of left- and right-handed twist in homogeneously aligned cells.

sufficient conditions are presented to prove incremental stability of the

procedure is proposed to design a switched control action that is active only
where the open-loop system is not sufficiently incrementally stable in order to
reduce the required control effort. The design procedure to either locally or

natural numbers. In particular, an infinite permutation can be constructed with
an aperiodic infinite word over $\{0,\ldots,q-1\}$ as the lexicographic order
of the shifts of the word. In this paper, we discuss the question if an
infinite permutation defined this way admits a canonical representative, that
is, can be defined by a sequence of numbers from [0, 1], such that the
frequency of its elements in any interval is equal to the length of that
interval. We show that a canonical representative exists if and only if the
word is uniquely ergodic, and that is why we use the term ergodic permutations.
We also discuss ways to construct the canonical representative of a permutation
defined by a morphic word and generalize the construction of Makarov, 2009, for
the Thue-Morse permutation to a wider class of infinite words.

shaped by integrated signals from both positive co-stimulatory and negative

of human cancer, but only in a fraction of cancer patients. Since this therapy

The sources were selected from the ATLASGAL submillimeter dust continuum survey
of our Galaxy. Clumps with high masses covering a range of evolutionary stages
based on their infrared properties were chosen. The ammonia line was detected
in all sources, leading to five new detections and one confirmation of a
previous detection of redshifted absorption in front of their strong THz
continuum as a probe of infall in the clumps. These detections include two
clumps embedded in infrared dark clouds. The measured velocity shifts of the
absorptions compared to optically thin \CSEO\ (3--2) emission are
0.3--2.8~km/s, corresponding to fractions of 3\%\ to 30\% of the free-fall
velocities of the clumps. The ammonia infall signature is compared with
complementary data of different transitions of HCN, HNC, CS, and HCO$^+$, which
are often used to probe infall via their blue-skewed line profiles. The best
agreement with the ammonia results is found for the HCO$^+$ (4--3) transitions,
but the latter is still strongly blended with emission from associated
outflows. This outflow signature is far less prominent in the THz ammonia
lines, which confirms it as a powerful probe of infall in molecular clumps.
Infall rates in the range from 0.3 to 16~$10^{-3}\,M_\odot/$yr were derived
with a tentative correlation with the virial parameters of the clumps. The new
observations show that infall on clump scales is ubiquitous through a wide
range of evolutionary stages, from $L/M$ covering about ten to several

a devastating impact on their functionalities.
  In this paper we focus on the interdependence between the power grid and the

Pictor A, which we combine with new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
observations. The new X-ray data have a factor 4 more exposure than
observations previously presented and span a 15-year time baseline, allowing a
detailed study of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of the AGN,
jet, hotspot and lobes. We present evidence for further time variation of the
jet, though the flare that we reported in previous work remains the most
significantly detected time-varying feature. We also confirm previous tentative
evidence for a faint counterjet. Based on the radio through X-ray spectrum of
the jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of the
counterjet, we argue that inverse-Compton models can be conclusively rejected,
and propose that the X-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission from
particles accelerated in the boundary layer of a relativistic jet. For the
first time, we find evidence that the bright western hotspot is also
time-varying in X-rays, and we connect this to the small-scale structure in the
hotspot seen in high-resolution radio observations. The new data allow us to
confirm that the spectrum of the lobes is in good agreement with the
predictions of an inverse-Compton model and we show that the data favour models
in which the filaments seen in the radio images are predominantly the result of
spatial variation of magnetic fields in the presence of a relatively uniform
electron distribution.

synthesis problems. The SyGuS problem is to find an expression or program
generated by a given grammar that meets a correctness specification.
Correctness specifications are given as formulas in suitable logical theories,
typically amongst those studied in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).
  In this work, we analyze the decidability of the SyGuS problem for different
classes of grammars and correctness specifications. We prove that the SyGuS
problem is undecidable for the theory of equality with uninterpreted functions
(EUF).We identify a fragment of EUF, which we call regular-EUF, for which the
SyGuS problem is decidable. We prove that this restricted problem is
EXPTIME-complete and that the sets of solution expressions are precisely the
regular tree languages. For theories that admit a unique, finite domain, we
give a general algorithm to solve the SyGuS problem on tree grammars.
Finite-domain theories include the bit-vector theory without concatenation. We
prove SyGuS undecidable for a very simple bit-vector theory with concatenation,
both for context-free grammars and for tree grammars. Finally, we give some
additional results for linear arithmetic and bit-vector arithmetic along with a
discussion of the implication of these results.

investigation of Titan using JWST, primarily with three of the four
instruments: NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI, noting that science with NIRISS will be
complementary. Five core scientific themes are identified: (i) surface (ii)
tropospheric clouds (iii) tropospheric gases (iv) stratospheric composition and
(v) stratospheric hazes. We discuss each theme in depth, including the
scientific purpose, capabilities and limitations of the instrument suite, and
suggested observing schemes. We pay particular attention to saturation, which
is a problem for all three instruments, but may be alleviated for NIRCam
through use of selecting small sub-arrays of the detectors - sufficient to
encompass Titan, but with significantly faster read-out times. We find that
JWST has very significant potential for advancing Titan science, with a
spectral resolution exceeding the Cassini instrument suite at near-infrared
wavelengths, and a spatial resolution exceeding HST at the same wavelengths. In
particular, JWST will be valuable for time-domain monitoring of Titan, given a
five to ten year expected lifetime for the observatory, for example monitoring
the seasonal appearance of clouds. JWST observations in the post-Cassini period
will complement those of other large facilities such as HST, ALMA, SOFIA and
next-generation ground-based telescopes (TMT, GMT, EELT).

evidence that the Raman-like RIXS excitations correspond to collective spin
excitations, which are magnons in the undoped Mott insulators and evolve into
paramagnons in doped superconducting compounds. In contrast, the
fluorescence-like shifts are due primarily to the continuum of particle-hole
excitations in the charge channel. Our results show that under the proper
experimental conditions RIXS indeed can be used to probe paramagnons in doped

polynomials to lower bounds on extended formulations of polytopes. Applying our
reduction to the seminal extended formulation lower bounds of Fiorini, Massar,
Pokutta, Tiwari, & de Wolf (STOC 2012; J. ACM, 2015) and Rothvoss (STOC 2014;
J. ACM, 2017), we obtain the following interesting consequences.
  1. The Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial is not a monotone subexponential-size
projection of the permanent; this both rules out a natural attempt at a
monotone lower bound on the Boolean permanent, and shows that the permanent is
not complete for non-negative polynomials in VNP$_{{\mathbb R}}$ under monotone
p-projections.
  2. The cut polynomials and the perfect matching polynomial (or ""unsigned
Pfaffian"") are not monotone p-projections of the permanent. The latter, over
the Boolean and-or semi-ring, rules out monotone reductions in one of the
natural approaches to reducing perfect matchings in general graphs to perfect
matchings in bipartite graphs.
  As the permanent is universal for monotone formulas, these results also imply
exponential lower bounds on the monotone formula size and monotone circuit size
of these polynomials.

power and decidability, which enables automatic verification---and hence
synthesis---of nontrivial programs. Second, a type-based specification for a

its components, causing the synthesizer to consider fewer component

type checking, which supports specification decomposition.
  We have evaluated our prototype implementation on a large set of synthesis

formed by strong binary interactions between the Mira and a companion in an
eccentric orbit during periastron passage ~800 years ago. We have performed
hydrodynamic simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star interacting with
companions with a range of masses in orbits with a range of initial
eccentricities and periastron separations. For reasonable values of the
eccentricity, we find that Roche lobe overflow can take place only if the
periods are <<100 years. Moreover, mass transfer causes the system to enter a
common envelope phase within several orbits. Since the central star of the
Rotten Egg nebula is an AGB star, we conclude that such a common envelope phase
must have lead to a merger, so the observed companion must have been a tertiary
companion of a binary that merged at the time of nebula ejection. Based on the
mass and timescale of the simulated disc formed around the companion before the
common envelope phase, we analytically estimate the properties of jets that
could be launched. Allowing for super-Eddington accretion rates, we find that
jets similar to those observed are plausible, provided that the putative lost

waterwheel modes self-regulate by reducing the current and by populating modes
nearby in fre- quency, leading to a dynamical steady state in which
non-conservative forces are counter-balanced by the electronic friction. The
waterwheel effect can be described by an appropriate effective non- equilibrium
dynamical response matrix. We show that the current-induced parts of this

(30 Doradus), in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using observations from the Hubble
Tarantula Treasury Project in the 0.3 - 1.6 micron range. The considerable and
patchy extinction inside the nebula causes about 3500 red clump stars to be
scattered along the reddening vector in the colour-magnitude diagrams, thereby
allowing an accurate determination of the reddening slope in all bands. The
measured slope of the reddening vector is remarkably steeper in all bands than
in the the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. At optical wavelengths, the
larger ratio of total-to-selective extinction, namely Rv = 4.5 +/- 0.2, implies
the presence of a grey component in the extinction law, due to a larger
fraction of large grains. The extra large grains are most likely ices from
supernova ejecta and will significantly alter the extinction properties of the
region until they sublimate in 50 - 100 Myr. We discuss the implications of
this extinction law for the Tarantula nebula and in general for regions of
massive star formation in galaxies. Our results suggest that fluxes of strongly
star forming regions are likely to be underestimated by a factor of about 2 in
the optical.

parameter $\theta_{i}$ for each of many items. For example, a key problem in
sponsored search is to estimate the click through rate (CTR) of each of
billions of query-ad pairs. Most common methods, though, only give a point
estimate of each $\theta_{i}$. A posterior distribution for each $\theta_{i}$
is usually more useful but harder to get.
  We present a simple post-processing technique that takes point estimates or
scores $t_{i}$ (from any method) and estimates an approximate posterior for
each $\theta_{i}$. We build on the idea of calibration, a common
post-processing technique that estimates
$\mathrm{E}\left(\theta_{i}\!\!\bigm|\!\! t_{i}\right)$. Our method, second
order calibration, uses empirical Bayes methods to estimate the distribution of
$\theta_{i}\!\!\bigm|\!\! t_{i}$ and uses the estimated distribution as an
approximation to the posterior distribution of $\theta_{i}$. We show that this
can yield improved point estimates and useful accuracy estimates. The method
scales to large problems - our motivating example is a CTR estimation problem

generalisations of the traditional (linear) expectations, this problem can be
understood as stochastic control of a family of nonlinear expectations, or
equivalently of nonlinear kernels. Our first main contribution is to prove a
dynamic programming principle for this control problem in an abstract setting,
which we then use to provide a semi-martingale characterisation of the value
function. We next explore several applications of our results. We first obtain
a wellposedness result for second order BSDEs (as introduced in [86]) which
does not require any regularity assumption on the terminal condition and the
generator. Then we prove a nonlinear optional decomposition in a robust
setting, extending recent results of [71], which we then use to obtain a
super-hedging duality in uncertain, incomplete and nonlinear financial markets.
Finally, we relate, under additional regularity assumptions, the value function
to a viscosity solution of an appropriate path-dependent partial differential

of scalar operators in conformal field theories in general dimension. We have
previously shown that conformal symmetry uniquely determines the momentum-space
3-point functions in terms of certain integrals involving a product of three
Bessel functions (triple-K integrals). The triple-K integrals diverge when the
dimensions of operators satisfy certain relations and we discuss how to obtain
renormalised 3-point functions in all cases. There are three different types of
divergences: ultralocal, semilocal and nonlocal, and a given divergent triple-K
integral may have any combination of them. Ultralocal divergences may be
removed using local counterterms and this results in new conformal anomalies.
Semilocal divergences may be removed by renormalising the sources, and this
results in CFT correlators that satisfy Callan-Symanzik equations with beta
functions. In the case of non-local divergences, it is the triple-K
representation that is singular, not the 3-point function. Here, the CFT
correlator is the coefficient of the leading nonlocal singularity, which
satisfies all the expected conformal Ward identities. Such correlators exhibit
enhanced symmetry: they are also invariant under dual conformal transformations
where the momenta play the role of coordinates. When both anomalies and beta
functions are present the correlators exhibit novel analytic structure
containing products of logarithms of momenta. We illustrate our discussion with
numerous examples, including free field realisations and AdS/CFT computations.

emission models to different regions of the extended X-ray emission we searched
for perturbations in density, temperature, pressure, and entropy of the hot

ICM and measured their spread in circular concentric annuli. Comparing the
spread of different gas quantities to high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic
simulations, we constrain the average Mach number regime of the sample to
Mach1D ~ 0.16 +- 0.07. In addition we found a tight correlation between

simulations if the giant planets undergo an orbital instability that ejects one
or more ice giants. During this instability, Jupiter and Saturn's orbits
diverge, crossing their 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and this
resonance-crossing can excite the terrestrial planet orbits. Using a large
ensemble of simulations of this giant planet instability, we directly model the
evolution of the terrestrial planet orbits during this process, paying special
attention to systems that reproduce the basic features of the outer planets. In
systems that retain four giant planets and finish with Jupiter and Saturn
beyond their 2:1 MMR, we find at least an 85% probability that at least one
terrestrial planet is lost. Moreover, systems that manage to retain all four
terrestrial planets often finish with terrestrial planet eccentricities and
inclinations larger than the observed ones. There is less than a ~5% chance
that the terrestrial planet orbits will have a level of excitation comparable
to the observed orbits. If we factor in the probability that the outer
planetary orbits are well-replicated, we find a probability of 1% or less that
the orbital architectures of the inner and outer planets are simultaneously
reproduced in the same system. These small probabilities raise the prospect
that the giant planet instability occurred before the terrestrial planets had
formed. This scenario implies that the giant planet instability is not the
source of the Late Heavy Bombardment and that terrestrial planet formation
finished with the giant planets in their modern configuration.

tracing the evolution of cold gas (molecular and atomic) in galaxies. To that
end, we have conducted a pilot study called CO Observations with the LMT of the
Blind Ultra-Deep H I Environment Survey (COOL BUDHIES). We have observed 23
galaxies in and around the two clusters Abell 2192 (z = 0.188) and Abell 963 (z

the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) to measure the $^{12}$CO J = 1 --> 0
emission line and obtain molecular gas masses. These new observations provide a
unique opportunity to probe both the molecular and atomic components of
galaxies as a function of environment beyond the local Universe. For our sample
of 23 galaxies, nine have reliable detections (S/N$\geq$3.6) of the $^{12}$CO
line, and another six have marginal detections (2.0 < S/N < 3.6). For the
remaining eight targets we can place upper limits on molecular gas masses
roughly between $10^9$ and $10^{10} M_\odot$. Comparing our results to other
studies of molecular gas, we find that our sample is significantly more
abundant in molecular gas overall, when compared to the stellar and the atomic
gas component, and our median molecular gas fraction lies about $1\sigma$ above
the upper limits of proposed redshift evolution in earlier studies. We discuss
possible reasons for this discrepancy, with the most likely conclusion being
target selection and Eddington bias.

argue that these ratios can likely be predicted to better than $5\%$, which

to $\gamma\gamma$ is especially promising in the near term, due to large rates

questionable in view of the large constituent quark masses induced by chiral
symmetry breaking. We find that this can be explained by what we call nonchiral

companions with masses between 10-40 MJup has been noticed at close
separations, suggesting the possibility of a distinct formation mechanism for
objects above and below this range. We present a model for the substellar
companion mass function (CMF). It consists of the superposition of the planet
and BD companion mass distributions, assuming that we can extrapolate the RV
measured companion mass function for planets to larger separations and the
stellar companion mass-ratio distribution over all separations into the BD mass
regime. By using both the results of the VLT/NaCo large program and the
complementary archive datasets that probe the occurrence of planets and BDs on
wide orbits around solar-type stars, we place some constraints on the planet
and BD distributions. We developed a MC simulation tool to predict the outcome
of a given survey, depending on the shape of the orbital parameter
distributions. Comparing the predictions with the results of the observations,
we calculate how likely different models are and which can be ruled out.
Current observations are consistent with the proposed model for the CMF, as
long as a sufficiently small outer truncation radius is introduced for the
planet separation distribution. The results of the direct imaging surveys
searching for substellar companions around Sun-like stars are consistent with a
combined substellar mass spectrum of planets and BDs. This mass distribution
has a minimum between 10 and 50 MJup, in agreement with RV measurements. The
dearth of objects in this mass range would naturally arise from the shape of
the mass distribution, without the introduction of any distinct formation
mechanism for BDs.

of stars by supermassive black holes have raised a number of puzzles.
Outstanding questions include the origin of the optical and ultraviolet (UV)
flux, the weakness of hydrogen lines in the spectrum, and the occasional
simultaneous observation of x-rays. Here we study the emission from tidal
disruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion
propagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar
debris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation,
and present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral
energy distribution (SED) and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak
brightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a non local thermodynamic
equilibrium treatment of the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen,
helium and oxygen (as a representative metal). Our calculations show how an
extended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft x-rays and produce the
observed optical fluxes of order 10^43 ergs per second. Variations in the mass
or size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time
with roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, x-rays can
highly ionize the reprocessing region and escape to be observed simultaneously
with the optical flux, producing an SED not described by a single blackbody.
Due to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly
suppressed relative to helium line emission (with HeII-to-H line ratios of at
least 5:1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star. We
discuss the implications of our results to understanding the type of stars
destroyed in TDEs and the physical processes responsible for producing the
observed flares.

no form of star formation feedback. After an initial transient, our galaxies

understanding both the limit in which hard substructure is resolved, as well as
the limit of a jet with a single hard core. In this paper we study in detail
the perturbative structure of two prominent jet substructure observables,
$N$-subjettiness and the energy correlation functions, as measured on

the end point. We discuss the effect of hadronization on the various

evidence for strong gravitational interactions. Using an expert ranking
procedure, we find that the quasar hosts are uniformly distributed within the
merger sequence of inactive galaxies, with no preference for quasars in
high-distortion hosts. Using a merger/non-merger cutoff approach, we recover
distortion fractions of $f_\mathrm{m,qso}=0.39\pm{}0.11$ for quasar hosts and
$f_\mathrm{m,gal}=0.30\pm{}0.05$ for inactive galaxies (distribution modes, 68%

fraction for quasar hosts over inactive galaxies is not significant, with a
probability that the quasar fraction is higher of
$P(f_\mathrm{m,qso}>f_\mathrm{m,gal}) = 0.78$ ($0.78\,\sigma{}$), in line with

Modest evolution in the median stellar mass versus halo mass (SHM) relationship

both nuclei are active, whereas in offset AGN only one nucleus is active. To
study the origin of such AGN pairs, we employ a cosmological, hydrodynamic

the corresponding BH from the less massive progenitor galaxy always accretes
with a higher Eddington ratio. In contrast, in offset AGN the active BH is
typically more massive than its non-active counterpart. Furthermore, dual AGN
in general accrete more gas from the intergalactic medium than offset AGN and

an appropriate phase retrieval based reconstruction algorithm can be used to
effectively recover the lost high resolution details from the multiple low
resolution acquired images. We analyze the effects of noise, required degree of
image overlap, and the effect of increasing synthetic aperture size on the
reconstructed image quality. We show that coherent camera arrays have the
potential to greatly improve imaging performance. Our simulations show
resolution gains of 10x and more are achievable. Furthermore, experimental
results from our proof-of-concept systems show resolution gains of 4x-7x for
real scenes. Finally, we introduce and analyze in simulation a new strategy to
capture macroscopic Fourier Ptychography images in a single snapshot, albeit

the literature, and (2) the 116 most massive early-type galaxies (and thus
likely hosts of the most massive black holes) within 108 Mpc from the MASSIVE

continuous waves (as a function of angular position in the sky) can already
constrain the mass ratios of hypothetical black hole binaries in many galaxies

Magellanic Clouds show a puzzling feature in their color-magnitude diagrams
(CMD) that is not in agreement with a simple stellar population. The main
sequence turn-off of these clusters is much broader than would be expected from
photometric uncertainties. One interpretation of this feature is that age
spreads of the order 200-500 Myr exist within individual clusters, although
this interpretation is highly debated. Such large age spreads should affect
other parts of the CMD, which are sensitive to age, as well. In this study, we
analyze the CMDs of a sample of 12 intermediate-age clusters in the Large
Magellanic Cloud that all show an extended turn-off using archival optical data
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. We fit the star formation history of the
turn-off region and the red clump region independently with two different
theoretical isochrone models. We find that in most of the cases, the age
spreads inferred from the red clumps are smaller than the ones resulting from
the turn-off region. However, the age ranges resulting from the red clump
region are broader than would be expected for a single age. Only two out of 12
clusters in our sample show a red clump which seems to be consistent with a
single age. As our results are not unambiguous, we can not ultimately tell if
the extended main sequence turn-off feature is due to an age spread, or not, by
fitting the star formation histories to the red clump regions. However, we find
that the width of the extended main sequence turn-off feature is correlated
with the age of the clusters in a way which would be unexplained in the ""age
spread"" interpretation, but which may be expected if stellar rotation is the
cause of the spread at the turn-off.

form. Here we investigate whether this mechanism can be inferred from
observations of young clusters. To address this question, we have computed SPH
simulations of the initial formation and evolution of a dynamically young star
cluster through cold (sub-virial) collapse, starting with an ellipsoidal,
turbulently seeded distribution of gas, and forming sink particles representing
(proto)stars. While the initial density distributions of the clouds do not have
large initial mass concentrations, gravitational focusing due to the global
morphology leads to cluster formation. We use the resulting structures to
extract observable morphological and kinematic signatures for the case of
sub-virial collapse. We find that the signatures of the initial conditions can
be erased rapidly as the gas and stars collapse, suggesting that kinematic
observations need to be made either early in cluster formation and/or at larger
scales, away from the growing cluster core. Our results emphasize that a
dynamically young system is inherently evolving on short timescales, so that it
can be highly misleading to use current-epoch conditions to study aspects such
as star formation rates as a function of local density. Our simulations serve
as a starting point for further studies of collapse including other factors

lowering the UV cutoff in the 5D picture allows for heavier top partners, while
keeping the mass of the Higgs boson at its observed value. In the 4D dual this
corresponds to increasing the number of colours. This is essentially a Little
Randall-Sundrum Model, which are known to reduce some flavour and electroweak
constraints. Furthermore, in anticipation of the ongoing efforts at the LHC to
put bounds on the top Yukawa, we demonstrate that deviations from the SM can be
suppressed or enhanced with respect to what is expected from mere symmetry

cosmology. As an application, we extend our earlier analysis and use the
Surprise to quantify the agreement between WMAP 9, Planck 13 and Planck 15
constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model. Using a principle component analysis in
parameter space, we find that the large Surprise between WMAP 9 and Planck 13
(S = 17.6 bits, implying a deviation from consistency at 99.8% confidence) is
due to a shift along a direction that is dominated by the amplitude of the
power spectrum. The Planck 15 constraints deviate from the Planck 13 results (S
= 56.3 bits), primarily due to a shift in the same direction. The Surprise
between WMAP and Planck consequently disappears when moving to Planck 15 (S =
-5.1 bits). This means that, unlike Planck 13, Planck 15 is not in tension with
WMAP 9. These results illustrate the advantages of the relative entropy and the
Surprise for quantifying the disagreement between cosmological experiments and
more generally as an information metric for cosmology.

with ultracold atoms, we investigate the ground-state properties of spin-1/2
fermions with attractive interactions in a one-dimensional box. We use lattice
Monte Carlo methods to determine essential quantities like the energy, which we
compute as a function of coupling strength and particle number in the regime
from few to many particles. Many-fermion systems bound by hard walls display
non-trivial density profiles characterized by so-called Friedel oscillations
(which are similar to those observed in harmonic traps). In non-interacting
systems, the characteristic length scale of the oscillations is set by (2
kF)^(-1), where kF is the Fermi momentum, while repulsive interactions tend to
generate Wigner-crystal oscillations of period (4 kF)^(-1). Based on the
non-interacting result, we find a remarkably simple parametrization of the
density profiles of the attractively interacting case, which we generalize to
the one-body density matrix. While the total momentum is not a conserved
quantity in the presence of hard walls, the magnitude of the momentum does
provide a good quantum number. We are therefore able to provide a detailed
characterization of the (quasi-)momentum distribution, which displays rather
robust discontinuity at the Fermi surface. In addition, we determine the
spatially varying on-site density-density correlation, which in turn yields
Tan's contact density and, upon integration, Tan's contact. As is well known,
the latter fully determines the short-range correlations and plays a crucial
role in a multitude of equilibrium and non-equilibrium sum rules.

to represent, respectively, parameterised systems and symmetry patterns. The
framework subsumes various types of symmetry relations ranging from weaker
notions (e.g. simulation preorders) to the strongest notion (i.e.
isomorphisms). Our framework enjoys two algorithmic properties: (1) symmetry
verification: given a transducer, we can automatically check whether it is a
symmetry pattern of a given system, and (2) symmetry synthesis: we can
automatically generate a symmetry pattern for a given system in the form of a
transducer. Furthermore, our symbolic language allows additional constraints
that the symmetry patterns need to satisfy to be easily incorporated in the
verification/synthesis. We show how these properties can help identify symmetry
patterns in examples like dining philosopher protocols, self-stabilising
protocols, and prioritised resource-allocator protocol. In some cases (e.g.
Gries's coffee can problem), our technique automatically synthesises a
safety-preserving finite approximant, which can then be verified for safety

real-valued variables. The questions concerned are:
  1. qualitative ones that ask (i) whether the program terminates with
probability 1 (almost-sure termination) and (ii) whether the expected
termination time is finite (finite termination); 2. quantitative ones that ask
(i) to approximate the expected termination time (expectation problem) and (ii)
to compute a bound B such that the probability to terminate after B steps
decreases exponentially (concentration problem).
  To solve these questions, we utilize the notion of ranking supermartingales
which is a powerful approach for proving termination of probabilistic programs.
In detail, we focus on algorithmic synthesis of linear ranking-supermartingales
over affine probabilistic programs (APP's) with both angelic and demonic
non-determinism. An important subclass of APP's is LRAPP which is defined as
the class of all APP's over which a linear ranking-supermartingale exists.
  Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, we show that the membership
problem of LRAPP (i) can be decided in polynomial time for APP's with at most
demonic non-determinism, and (ii) is NP-hard and in PSPACE for APP's with
angelic non-determinism; moreover, the NP-hardness result holds already for
APP's without probability and demonic non-determinism. Secondly, we show that
the concentration problem over LRAPP can be solved in the same complexity as
for the membership problem of LRAPP. Finally, we show that the expectation
problem over LRAPP can be solved in 2EXPTIME and is PSPACE-hard even for APP's
without probability and non-determinism (i.e., deterministic programs). Our
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to answer
the qualitative and quantitative questions over APP's with at most demonic
non-determinism.

favors the classical order in the desired pattern and an $H_1$, which is
treated in perturbation theory by a series expansion. We find that the ground

the anisotropy $\Delta$. Results for ground state energy and the magnetization
are presented. These results are compared with recent spin-wave theory and
coupled-cluster calculations. The series results for the phase diagram are
close to the predictions of spin-wave theory. For the spin-one model at the
Heisenberg point ($\Delta=1$), our results are consistent with a vanishing
order parameter, that is an absence of a magnetically ordered phase. We also
develop series expansions for the ground state energy of the spin-one

in this phase is lower than those of magnetically ordered ones, supporting the

\cite{ElhamifarV13} and $\ell^{1}$-graph \cite{YanW09,ChengYYFH10}, are
effective in partitioning the data that lie in a union of subspaces. Most of
those methods use $\ell^{1}$-norm or $\ell^{2}$-norm with thresholding to
impose the sparsity of the constructed sparse similarity graph, and certain
assumptions, e.g. independence or disjointness, on the subspaces are required
to obtain the subspace-sparse representation, which is the key to their
success. Such assumptions are not guaranteed to hold in practice and they limit
the application of sparse subspace clustering on subspaces with general
location. In this paper, we propose a new sparse subspace clustering method
named $\ell^{0}$-graph. In contrast to the required assumptions on subspaces
for most existing sparse subspace clustering methods, it is proved that
subspace-sparse representation can be obtained by $\ell^{0}$-graph for
arbitrary distinct underlying subspaces almost surely under the mild i.i.d.
assumption on the data generation. We develop a proximal method to obtain the
sub-optimal solution to the optimization problem of $\ell^{0}$-graph with
proved guarantee of convergence. Moreover, we propose a regularized
$\ell^{0}$-graph that encourages nearby data to have similar neighbors so that
the similarity graph is more aligned within each cluster and the graph
connectivity issue is alleviated. Extensive experimental results on various

large number of receivers need to be efficient but also have limited loss
tolerance. The new Information-Centric Networks (ICN) paradigm offers an
alternative approach for reliably delivering data by naming content and
exploiting data available at any intermediate point (e.g., caches). However,
receivers are often heterogeneous, with widely varying receive rates. When
using existing ICN congestion control mechanisms with in-sequence delivery, a
particularly thorny problem of receivers going out-of-sync results in
inefficiency and unfairness with heterogeneous receivers. We argue that
separating reliability from congestion control leads to more scalable,
efficient and fair data dissemination, and propose SAID, a Control Protocol for
Scalable and Adaptive Information Dissemination in ICN. To maximize the amount
of data transmitted at the first attempt, receivers request any next packet
(ANP) of a flow instead of next-in-sequence packet, independent of the
provider's transmit rate. This allows providers to transmit at an
application-efficient rate, without being limited by the slower receivers. SAID
ensures reliable delivery to all receivers eventually, by cooperative repair,
while preserving privacy without unduly trusting other receivers.

service). Such carrier-grade text service has been widely used to assist
versatile mobile services, including social networking, banking, to name a few.
Though the text service can be spoofed via certain Internet text service
providers which cooperated with carriers, such attacks haven well studied and
defended by industry due to the efforts of research community. However, as
cellular network technology advances to the latest IP-based 4G LTE, we find
that these mobile services are somehow exposed to new threats raised by this
change, particularly on 4G LTE Text service (via brand-new distributed
Mobile-Initiated Spoofed SMS attack which is not available in legacy 2G/3G
systems). The reason is that messaging service over LTE shifts from the
circuit-switched (CS) design to the packet-switched (PS) paradigm as 4G LTE
supports PS only. Due to this change, 4G LTE Text Service becomes open to
access. However, its shields to messaging integrity and user authentication are
not in place. As a consequence, such weaknesses can be exploited to launch
attacks (e.g., hijack Facebook accounts) against a targeted individual, a large
scale of mobile users and even service providers, from mobile devices. Current
defenses for Internet-Initiated Spoofed SMS attacks cannot defend the
unprecedented attack. Our study shows that 53 of 64 mobile services over 27
industries are vulnerable to at least one threat. We validate these
proof-of-concept attacks in one major US carrier which supports more than 100

on Crater's physical properties. Structurally, Crater has a half-light radius
of $\sim$20 pc and shows no evidence for tidal distortions. Crater is
well-described by a simple stellar population with an age of $\sim$7.5 Gyr,
[M/H]$\sim-1.65$, a M$_{\star}\sim10^4$ M$_{\odot}$, M$_{\rm V}\sim -5.3$,
located at a distance of d$\sim$ 145 kpc, with modest uncertainties in these

descendants, as opposed to intermediate age main sequence stars. Confusion of
these populations highlights a substantial challenge in accurately
characterizing sparsely populated stellar systems. Our analysis shows that
Crater is not a dwarf galaxy, but instead is an unusually young cluster given
its location in the Milky Way's very outer stellar halo. Crater is similar to
SMC cluster Lindsay 38, and its position and velocity are in good agreement

evidence for these claims are far from satisfactory, because of different
statistical powers of the homogeneity tests under different effect scales. For
binary treatment, covariate and outcome, we theoretically quantify the
homogeneity of different effect scales. Because when homogeneity holds the four
outcome probabilities lie in a three dimensional sub-space of the four
dimensional space, we can use results from differential geometry to compute the
volumes of these three dimensional spaces to compare the relative homogeneity
of the risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio. We demonstrate that the
homogeneity space for the risk difference has the smallest volume, and the
homogeneity space for the odds ratio has the largest volume, providing some
further evidence for the previous claim that the risk difference is more
heterogeneous than the risk ratio and odds ratio.

SNRs in our Galaxy and compiled a large sample that have an ""axisymmetric""
morphology, which we define to mean SNRs with a ""bilateral"" or ""barrel""-shaped
morphology, in addition to one-sided shells. We selected the cleanest examples
and model each of these at their appropriate Galactic position using two GMF
models, those of Jansson & Farrar (2012a), which includes a vertical halo
component, and Sun et al. (2008) that is oriented entirely parallel to the
plane. Since the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetic field
changes with distance from the sun, we analyse a range of distances, from 0.5
to 10 kpc in each case. Using a physically motivated model of a SNR expanding
into the ambient GMF, we find the models using Jansson & Farrar (2012a) are
able to reproduce observed morphologies of many SNRs in our sample. These
results strongly support the presence of an off-plane, vertical component to
the GMF, and the importance of the Galactic field on SNR morphology. Our
approach also provides a potential new method for determining distances to
SNRs, or conversely, distances to features in the large-scale GMF if SNR
distances are known.

personalized/individualized medicine stems from the recognition that some
clinical trial patients are better controls for you than others. Therefore,
treatment decisions for you should depend only on a subset of relevant
patients. Individualized statistical inference implements this idea for control
problems (rather than patients). Its potential for improving data analysis
matches personalized medicine's for improving healthcare. The central
issue--for both individualized medicine and individualized inference--is how to
make the right relevance robustness trade-off: if we exercise too much

properties at the micro-, meso-, and macroscopic scales, while still being easy
to compute and easy to interpret at a glance. Our statistic, the onion
spectrum, is based on the onion decomposition, which refines the k-core
decomposition, a standard network fingerprinting method. The onion spectrum is
exactly as easy to compute as the k-cores: It is based on the stages at which
each vertex gets removed from a graph in the standard algorithm for computing
the k-cores. But the onion spectrum reveals much more information about a
network, and at multiple scales; for example, it can be used to quantify node
heterogeneity, degree correlations, centrality, and tree- or lattice-likeness
of the whole network as well as of each k-core. Furthermore, unlike the k-core
decomposition, the combined degree-onion spectrum immediately gives a clear
local picture of the network around each node which allows the detection of
interesting subgraphs whose topological structure differs from the global
network organization. This local description can also be leveraged to easily
generate samples from the ensemble of networks with a given joint degree-onion
distribution. We demonstrate the utility of the onion spectrum for
understanding both static and dynamic properties on several standard graph
models and on many real-world networks.

primary challenge in pCT image reconstruction lies in the degraded spatial

Analytical models such as the most likely path (MLP) have been proposed to
predict the scattered trajectory from measurements of individual proton
location and direction before and after the object. Iterative algorithms
provide a flexible tool with which to incorporate these models into image
reconstruction. The modeling leads to a large and sparse linear system of
equations that can efficiently be solved by projection methods-based iterative
algorithms. Such algorithms perform projections of the iterates onto the
hyperlanes that are represented by the linear equations of the system. They
perform these projections in possibly various algorithmic structures, such as
block-iterative projections (BIP), string-averaging projections (SAP). These
algorithmic schemes allow flexibility of choosing blocks, strings, and other
parameters. They also cater for parallel implementations which are apt to
further save clock time in computations. Experimental results are presented

is a randomized first-order incremental algorithm for minimizing a finite sum
of convex component functions. RR proceeds in cycles, picking a uniformly
random order (permutation) and processing the component functions one at a time
according to this order, i.e., at each cycle, each component function is
sampled without replacement from the collection. Though RR has been numerically
observed to outperform its with-replacement counterpart stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), characterization of its convergence rate has been a long
standing open question. In this paper, we answer this question by showing that
when the component functions are quadratics or smooth and the sum function is
strongly convex, RR with iterate averaging and a diminishing stepsize
$\alpha_k=\Theta(1/k^s)$ for $s\in (1/2,1)$ converges at rate
$\Theta(1/k^{2s})$ with probability one in the suboptimality of the objective
value, thus improving upon the $\Omega(1/k)$ rate of SGD. Our analysis draws on
the theory of Polyak-Ruppert averaging and relies on decoupling the dependent
cycle gradient error into an independent term over cycles and another term
dominated by $\alpha_k^2$. This allows us to apply law of large numbers to an
appropriately weighted version of the cycle gradient errors, where the weights
depend on the stepsize. We also provide high probability convergence rate
estimates that shows decay rate of different terms and allows us to propose a
modification of RR with convergence rate ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{k^2})$.

finite sum of smooth convex functions, used in many contexts including
large-scale data processing applications and distributed optimization over
networks. It is a first-order method that processes the functions one at a time
based on their gradient information. The incremental Newton method, on the
other hand, is a second-order variant which exploits additionally the curvature
information of the underlying functions and can therefore be faster. In this
paper, we focus on the case when the objective function is strongly convex and
present fast convergence results for the incremental gradient and incremental
Newton methods under the constant and diminishing stepsizes. For a decaying
stepsize rule $\alpha_k = \Theta(1/k^s)$ with $s \in (0,1]$, we show that the
distance of the IG iterates to the optimal solution converges at rate ${\cal
O}(1/k^{s})$ (which translates into ${\cal O}(1/k^{2s})$ rate in the
suboptimality of the objective value). For $s>1/2$, this improves the previous
${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ results in distances obtained for the case when
functions are non-smooth. We show that to achieve the fastest ${\cal O}(1/k)$
rate, incremental gradient needs a stepsize that requires tuning to the strong
convexity parameter whereas the incremental Newton method does not. The results
are based on viewing the incremental gradient method as a gradient descent
method with gradient errors, devising efficient upper bounds for the gradient
error to derive inequalities that relate distances of the consecutive iterates
to the optimal solution and finally applying Chung's lemmas from the stochastic
approximation literature to these inequalities to determine their asymptotic
behavior. In addition, we construct examples to show tightness of our rate
results.

number of layers in the sample. Carrier lifetimes increase from few tens of
picoseconds in monolayer samples to more than a nanosecond in 10-layer samples.
The inverse carrier lifetime was found to scale according to the probability of
the carriers being present at the surface layers, as given by the carrier
wavefunction in few layer samples, which can be treated as quantum wells. The
carrier lifetimes were found to be largely independent of the temperature and
the inverse carrier lifetimes scaled linearly with the photoexcited carrier
density. These observations are consistent with defect-assisted carrier
recombination, in which the capture of electrons and holes by defects occurs
via Auger scatterings. Our results suggest that carrier lifetimes in few-layer
samples are surface recombination limited due to the much larger defect
densities at the surface layers compared to the inner layers.

is created in a magnetosphere. The creation of the density gradient, instead of
the usual flattening by a diffusion process, can be explained by the
topological constraints given by the adiabatic invariants of magnetized
particles. After developing a canonical formalism for the standard guiding
center dynamics in a dipole magnetic field, we complete our attempt to build a
statistical mechanics on a constrained phase space by discussing the
construction principles of the associated diffusion operator. We then
investigate the heating mechanism associated with inward diffusion: as
particles move toward regions of higher magnetic field, they experience
preferential heating of the perpendicular (with respect to the magnetic field)
temperature in order to preserve the magnetic moment. A relationship between
conservation of bounce action and temperature isotropy emerged. We further show
that this behavior is scaled by the diffusion parameter of the Fokker-Planck
equation. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

This obliquity was measured via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, obtained with
observations from Keck-HIRES. The velocities were extracted using a novel
technique, optimised for low signal-to-noise spectra, achieving a high
precision of 4 m/s point-to-point scatter. However, we caution that our
uncertainties may be underestimated. Due to the low rotational velocity of the
star, the detection significance is dependent on the vsini prior that is
imposed in our modelling. Based on trends observed in the sample of hot
Jupiters with obliquity measurements, it has been suggested that these planets
modify the spin axes of their host stars, with an efficiency that depends on
the stellar type and orbital period of the system. In this framework,
short-period planets around stars with surface convective envelopes, like
HATS-14b, are expected to have orbits that are aligned with the spin axes of
their host stars. HATS-14b, however, is a significant outlier from this trend,
challenging the effectiveness of the tidal realignment mechanism.

data corresponding to each agent in this separable optimization problem, such
as the network resources, the local allocation feasibility constraint, and the
local objective function, is only accessible to individual agent and cannot be

two classes of continuous-time algorithms are proposed to solve this

Thus, no re-initialization is required even if the operation environment or

algorithm convergence is guaranteed for strictly convex objective functions,
and the exponential convergence is proved for strongly convex functions without

global optimum in a scalable way, even when the generation cost, or system

unicast index coding problems where there is a source with K messages and there
are K receivers each wanting a unique message and having symmetric (with
respect to the receiver index) antidotes (side information). Optimal scalar
linear index codes for several such instances of this class of problems have
been reported in \cite{MRRarXiv}. These codes can be viewed as special cases of
the symmetric unicast index coding problems discussed in \cite{MCJ}. In this
paper a lifting construction is given which constructs a sequence of multiple
unicast index problems starting from a given multiple unicast index coding
problem. Also, it is shown that if an optimal scalar linear index code is known
for the problem given starting problem then optimal scalar linear index codes
can be obtained from the known code for all the problems arising from the
proposed lifting construction. For several of the known classes of multiple
unicast problems our construction is used to obtain several sequences of
multiple unicast problem with optimal scalar linear index codes.

Nevil Mott has first proposed that the metallic behavior of interacting
electrons could turn to the insulating one as electron correlations increase.
Here, we consider electrons with massless Dirac-like dispersion in two spatial
dimensions, described by the Hubbard models on two geometrically different
lattices, and perform numerically exact calculations on unprecedentedly large
systems that, combined with a careful finite size scaling analysis, allow us to
explore the quantum critical behavior in the vicinity of the interaction-driven
metal-insulator transition. We find thereby that the transition is continuous
and determine the quantum criticality for the corresponding universality class,
which is described in the continuous limit by the Gross-Neveu model, a model
extensively studied in quantum field theory. We furthermore discuss a
fluctuation-driven scenario for the metal-insulator transition in the
interacting Dirac electrons: the metal-insulator transition is triggered only
by the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight but not the Dirac Fermi velocity,
which instead remains finite near the transition. This important feature cannot
be captured by a simple mean-field or Gutzwiller-type approximate picture, but
is rather consistent with the low energy behavior of the Gross-Neveu model.

reactor to be operated in stationary conditions at the critical point, the
population of prompt neutrons instantaneously emitted at fission must be in
equilibrium with the much smaller population of delayed neutrons, emitted after
a Poissonian time by nuclear decay of the fissioned nuclei. In this work, we
will show that the delayed neutrons, although representing a tiny fraction of

about $10^{2-3}M_{\odot}$. However, the recent discovery of NuSTAR
J095551+6940.8 in M82 by Bachetti et al. shows that it holds the spin period
$P=1.37\rm\,s$ and period {\bf derivative}
$\dot{P}\approx-2\times10^{-10}\rm\,s\,s^{-1}$, which provides a strong
evidence that some ultra-luminous X-ray sources could be neutron stars. We
obtain that the source may be an evolved magetar, according to our simulation
by employing the model of accretion induced the polar magnetic field decay and
standard spin-up torque of an accreting neutron star. The results show that
NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is still in the spin-up process, and the polar magnetic
field decays to about $4.5\times10^{12}\rm\,G$ after accreting $\sim
10^{-2.5}$\ms, while the strong magnetic field exists in the out-polar region,
which could be responsible for the observed low field magnetar. The ultra
luminosity of the source can be explained by the beaming effort and two kinds
of accretion--radial random accretion and disk accretion. Since the birth rate
of magnetars is about ten percent of the normal neutron stars, we guess that
several ultra-luminous X-ray sources should share the similar properties to
that of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8.

  1) The linear problem, that is, $f(x,t)=f(x)$, where according to the
summability of the datum $f$ and the parameter $\lambda$ we give the
summability of the solution $u$.
  2) The problem with a nonlinear term $f(x,t)=\frac{h(x)}{t^\sigma}$ for
$t>0$. In this case, existence and regularity will depend on the value of
$\sigma$ and on the summability of $h$.

soft because the Standard Model (SM) parameters are subject to no fine-tuning

fine-tuning leaves behind a large vacuum energy $\propto \Lambda_{\rm UV}^4$
which inflates the Universe with a Hubble rate $\propto \Lambda_{\rm UV}$,
$\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ being the SM ultraviolet boundary. This means that the
tensor-to-scalar ratio inferred from cosmic microwave background polarization
measurements by BICEP2, Planck and others lead to the determination of
$\Lambda_{\rm UV}$. The exit from the inflationary phase, as usual, is
accomplished via decays of the vacuum energy. Here we show that, identification

for detection or imaging purposes. The best approach so far to get rid of
multiple scattering is optical coherence tomography. It basically combines
confocal microscopy and coherence time-gating to discriminate ballistic photons
from a predominant multiple scattering background. Nevertheless, the imaging
depth range remains limited to 1 mm at best in human soft tissues. Here we
propose a matrix approach of optical imaging to push back this fundamental
limit. By combining a matrix discrimination of ballistic waves and iterative
time-reversal, we show both theoretically and experimentally an extension of
the imaging-depth limit by at least a factor two compared to optical coherence
tomography. In particular, the reported experiment demonstrates imaging through
a strongly scattering layer from which only one reflected photon over 1000

the radiative recombinations involving strain-split light (cG-LH) and heavy

is found to have a low temperature circular polarization degree of about 85%
despite an off-resonance excitation of more than 300 meV. By photoluminescence
(PL) measurements and tight binding calculations we show that this
exceptionally high value is due to the peculiar energy dependence of the

considered to be negligible, can dominate the room temperature PL even at low

particular, it is well-posed on the biologically relevant state space of
Lebesgue integrable functions. We also formulate a delayed integral equation
(renewal equation) for the distributed birth rate of the population. We aim to
illustrate the connection between the partial integro-differential and the
delayed integral equation formulation of the model utilising a recent spectral

characterise irreducibility of the semigroup governing the linear partial

delayed integral equation determines a (non-negative) solution of the partial

results, which establish the equivalence between a general class of partial

Because the quantum well contained a two-dimensional electron gas, the spectra
consisted of several features. Since the quantum well layer was formed by a
diluted magnetic semiconductor, the spectra showed pronounced
polarization-dependent transformations when the in-plane magnetic field was
applied. In the magnetic field, a 90-degrees rotation of the sample about the
surface normal axis resulted in a clearly different spectrum, meaning that the
nominally equivalent [110] and [1-10] directions in the sample are not
equivalent in fact. But, remarkably, the additional 90-degrees rotations of
both the polarizer and the analyzer restored the initial spectrum. This
combined invariance regarding simultaneous 90-degrees rotation of the sample
and reversal of the polarization configuration was known earlier for spin-flip
Raman spectra only. Our present observations are interpreted in terms of the
mixing of valence subbands leading to the pseudo-isotropic g-factor of the

different dynamical behaviors for the walker, corresponding to two opposite
noise regimes: slow noise (i.e. strong coupling with the environment) confines
the walker into few lattice nodes, while fast noise (weak coupling) induces a
transition between quantum and classical diffusion over the lattice. A phase
transition between the two dynamical regimes may be observed by tuning the
ratio between the autocorrelation time of the noise and the coupling between
the walker and the external environment generating the noise. We also address
the non-Markovianity of the quantum map by assessing its memory effects, as

the Husimi lattice using numerical tensor-network methods based on Projected
Entangled Simplex States (PESS). The nature of the ground state varies strongly
with the spin quantum number, $S$. For $S = 1/2$, it is an algebraic (gapless)
quantum spin liquid. For $S = 1$, it is a gapped, non-magnetic state with
spontaneous breaking of triangle symmetry (a trimerized simplex-solid state).
For $S = 2$, it is a simplex-solid state with a spin gap and no
symmetry-breaking; both integer-spin simplex-solid states are characterized by
specific degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum. For $S = 3/2$, and indeed
for all spin values $S \ge 5/2$, the ground states have $120$-degree
antiferromagnetic order. In a finite magnetic field, we find that, irrespective
of the value of $S$, there is always a plateau in the magnetization at $m =
1/3$.

These circuits allow us to sample from the output probability distributions of

theory. This is a new link between continuous-time quantum walks and

ultimately demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computers. As a proof

exponential growth rate of the number of self-avoiding walks from a given
origin. The relationship between connective constants and amenability is
explored in the current work.
  Various properties of connective constants depend on the existence of
so-called 'graph height functions', namely: (i) whether $\mu(G)$ is a local
function on certain graphs derived from $G$, (ii) the equality of $\mu(G)$ and
the asymptotic growth rate of bridges, and (iii) whether there exists a
terminating algorithm for approximating $\mu(G)$ to a given degree of accuracy.
  In the context of amenable groups, it is proved that the Cayley graphs of
infinite, finitely generated, elementary amenable groups support graph height
functions, which are in addition harmonic. In contrast, the Cayley graph of the
Grigorchuk group, which is amenable but not elementary amenable, does not have
a graph height function.
  In the context of non-amenable, transitive graphs, a lower bound is presented
for the connective constant in terms of the spectral bottom of the graph. This
is a strengthening of an earlier result of the same authors. Secondly, using a
percolation inequality of Benjamini, Nachmias, and Peres, it is explained that
the connective constant of a non-amenable, transitive graph with large girth is
close to that of a regular tree. Examples are given of non-amenable groups
without graph height functions, of which one is the Higman group.

those of two asteroseismic samples - the largest sample from Huber et al.

that LSP3 surface gravities are in good agreement with asteroseismic values of
Hekker et al. (2012, 2013), with a dispersion of about 0.2 dex. Except for a
few cases, asteroseismic surface gravities of Huber et al. (2014) and LSP3

through the turbulent interstellar gas, which could have significant effects
upon interstellar chemistry by modifying grain accretion. This effect is
investigated in this work on the basis of numerical gas-grain chemical
modeling. Major features of the grain motion effect in the typical environment
of dark clouds (DC) can be summarised as follows: 1) decrease of gas-phase
(both neutral and ionic) abundances and increase of surface abundances by up to
2-3 orders of magnitude; 2) shifts of the existing chemical jumps to earlier
evolution ages for gas-phase species and to later ages for surface species by
factors of about ten; 3) a few exceptional cases in which some species turn out
to be insensitive to this effect and some other species can show opposite
behaviors too. These effects usually begin to emerge from a typical DC model
age of about 10^5 yr. The grain motion in a typical cold neutral medium (CNM)
can help overcome the Coulomb repulsive barrier to enable effective accretion
of cations onto positively charged grains. As a result, the grain motion
greatly enhances the abundances of some gas-phase and surface species by
factors up to 2-6 or more orders of magnitude in the CNM model. The grain
motion effect in a typical molecular cloud (MC) is intermediate between that of
the DC and CNM models, but with weaker strength. The grain motion is found to
be important to consider in chemical simulations of typical interstellar
medium.

the preliminary estimates of the functional coefficients. Then, using the
quadratic approximation for the local log-likelihood function and the adaptive
group LASSO penalty (or the local linear approximation of the group SCAD
penalty) with the help of the preliminary estimation of the functional
coefficients, we introduce a novel penalised weighted least squares procedure
to select the significant covariates and identify the constant coefficients
among the coefficients of the selected covariates, which could thus specify the
semiparametric modelling structure. The developed model selection and structure
specification approach not only inherits many nice statistical properties from
the local maximum likelihood estimation and nonconcave penalised likelihood
method, but also computationally attractive thanks to the computational
algorithm that is proposed to implement our method. Under some mild conditions,
we establish the asymptotic properties for the proposed model selection and
estimation procedure such as the sparsity and oracle property. We also conduct
simulation studies to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed
method, and finally apply the method to analyse a real data set, which leads to
some interesting findings.

distribution or data cloud. It provides a natural center-outward ordering of
multivariate data points and yields a systematic nonparametric multivariate
analysis scheme. In particular, the half-space depth is shown to have many
desirable properties and broad applicability. However, the empirical half-space
depth is zero outside the convex hull of the data. This property has rendered
the empirical half-space depth useless outside the data cloud, and limited its
utility in applications where the extreme outlying probability mass is the
focal point, such as in classification problems and control charts with very
small false alarm rates. To address this issue, we apply extreme value
statistics to refine the empirical half-space depth in ""the tail."" This
provides an important linkage between data depth, which is useful for inference
on centrality, and extreme value statistics, which is useful for inference on
extremity. The refined empirical half-space depth can thus extend all its
utilities beyond the data cloud, and hence broaden greatly its applicability.
The refined estimator is shown to have substantially improved upon the
empirical estimator in theory and simulations. The benefit of this improvement
is also demonstrated through the applications in classification and statistical
process control.

field theory and loop quantum gravity, quantum states and histories of the
geometric degrees of freedom turn out to be based on discrete spacetime. The
most pressing issue is then how the smooth geometries of general relativity,
expressed in terms of suitable geometric observables, arise from such discrete
quantum geometries in some semiclassical and continuum limit. In this thesis I
tackle the question of suitable observables focusing on the effective dimension
of discrete quantum geometries. For this purpose I give a purely combinatorial
description of the discrete structures which these geometries have support on.
As a side topic, this allows to present an extension of group field theory to
cover the combinatorially larger kinematical state space of loop quantum
gravity. Moreover, I introduce a discrete calculus for fields on such
fundamentally discrete geometries with a particular focus on the Laplacian.
This permits to define the effective-dimension observables for quantum
geometries. Analysing various classes of quantum geometries, I find as a
general result that the spectral dimension is more sensitive to the underlying
combinatorial structure than to the details of the additional geometric data
thereon. Semiclassical states in loop quantum gravity approximate the classical
geometries they are peaking on rather well and there are no indications for
stronger quantum effects. On the other hand, in the context of a more general
model of states which are superposition over a large number of complexes, based
on analytic solutions, there is a flow of the spectral dimension from the
topological dimension $d$ on low energy scales to a real number $0<\alpha<d$ on
high energy scales. In the particular case of $\alpha=1$ these results allow to
understand the quantum geometry as effectively fractal.

quasi-stationary simulation methods. Our findings (allied to numerical studies

  Theory",,,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The sheaf-theoretic structure is useful in classifying no-go theorems related
to non-locality and contextuality. It provides a new point of view different
from conventional formularization of quantum mechanics. First, we examine a
relationship between the conventional formularization and the innovative
formularization. There exists an equivalence of their categories, and from the
equivalence, one locality can be transformed to another as a concrete example.
Next, we extend the quantum mechanics which has a finite-degree of freedom to
the quantum filed theory with an infinite-degree of freedom, especially to the
algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT for short). We consider about a violation
of the Bell inequality in AQFT, and we show that the condition of strict
spacelike separation has the same Cartesian product structure as locality of
quantum mechanics. Also, we show that no-signalling property can be proved by
Split Property. A local state is a sheaf which is defined by Split Property in
AQFT. It induces the sheaf-theoretic structure. Finally, we show an extension
of the No-Signalling theorem which depends on spacetime in AQFT.

system made of 2D layers with inverted energy band spectrum: HgTe. The
magnetotransport reveals a considerably larger overlap of the conduction and
valence subbands than in known HgTe single quantum wells (QW), which may be
regulated by an applied gate voltage $V_g$. This large overlap manifests itself
in a much higher critical field $B_c$ separating the range above it where the
quantum peculiarities shift linearly with $V_g$ and the range below with a
complicated behavior. In the latter case the $N$-shaped and double-$N$-shaped
structures in the Hall magnetoresistance $\rho_{xy}(B)$ are observed with their
scale in field pronouncedly enlarged as compared to the pictures observed in an
analogous single QW. The coexisting electrons and holes were found in the whole
investigated range of positive and negative $V_g$ as revealed from fits to the
low-field $N$-shaped $\rho_{xy}(B)$ and from the Fourier analysis of
oscillations in $\rho_{xx}(B)$. A peculiar feature here is that the found
electron density $n$ remains almost constant in the whole range of investigated
$V_g$ while the hole density $p$ drops down from the value a factor of 6 larger
than $n$ at extreme negative $V_g$ to almost zero at extreme positive $V_g$
passing through the charge neutrality point. We show that this difference
between $n$ and $p$ stems from an order of magnitude larger density of states
for holes in the lateral valence band maxima than for electrons in the
conduction band minimum. We interpret the observed reentrant sign-alternating
$\rho_{xy}(B)$ between electronic and hole conductivities and its zero
resistivity state in the quantum Hall range of fields on the basis of a
calculated picture of magnetic levels in a DQW.

the new method to measure the effective action in the small volume range and to
explain the behaviour of the stalk part of the CDT triangulations. Finally we

driven by fractional Brownian motions. One is the incomplete Taylor scheme
which excludes some terms of an Taylor scheme in its recursive computation so
as to reduce the computation time. The other one is to add some deterministic
terms to an incomplete Taylor scheme to improve the mean rate of convergence.
Almost sure rate of convergence and $L_p$-rate of convergence are obtained for
the incomplete Taylor schemes. Almost sure rate is expressed in terms of the
H\""older exponents of the driving signals and the $L_p$-rate is expressed by
the Hurst parameters. Both rates involves with the incomplete Taylor scheme in
a very explicit way and then provide us with the best incomplete schemes,
depending on that one needs the almost sure convergence or one needs
$L_p$-convergence. As in the smooth case, general Taylor schemes are always
complicated to deal with. The incomplete Taylor scheme is even more
sophisticated to analyze. A new feature of our approach is the explicit
expression of the error functions which will be easier to study. Estimates for
multiple integrals and formulas for the iterated vector fields are obtained to
analyze the error functions and then to obtain the rates of convergence.

burden on quantum key distribution (QKD) systems: they must defeat a passive
eavesdropper who detects all the light lost in the quantum channel and does so
without disturbing the light that reaches the intended destination. The current
QKD implementation with the highest long-distance secret-key rate meets this
challenge by transmitting no more than one photon per bit [Opt. Express 21,
24550-24565 (2013)]. As a result, it cannot achieve the Gbps secret-key rate
needed for one-time pad encryption of large data files unless an impractically
large amount of multiplexing is employed. We introduce floodlight QKD (FL-QKD),
which floods the quantum channel with a high number of photons per bit
distributed over a much greater number of optical modes. FL-QKD offers security
against the optimum frequency-domain collective attack by transmitting less
than one photon per mode and using photon-coincidence channel monitoring, and
it is completely immune to passive eavesdropping. More importantly, FL-QKD is
capable of a 2 Gbps secret-key rate over a 50 km fiber link, without any
multiplexing, using available equipment, i.e., no new technology need be
developed. FL-QKD achieves this extraordinary secret-key rate by virtue of its
unprecedented secret-key efficiency, in bits per channel use, which exceeds
those of state-of-the-art systems by two orders of magnitude.

understand why PIC simulations are either energy or momentum conserving but not
both, what the role of numerical stability is in non-conservation, and how do
errors in conservation scale with the numerical parameters. Conserving both
momentum and energy make it possible to model problems such as Jeans' -type

laser are calculated using nonequilibrium Green's functions. Impurity
scattering is shown to be responsible for contrasting nonlinear effects in the
transport and the gain properties. For typical doping concentrations, the
current density is found to be weakly sensitive to the impurity scattering
strength. In contrast, the calculated gain is found to be very sensitive to the
impurity scattering strength. This difference is attributed to the strong
momentum dependence of the long-range coupling to charged impurities.
Small-momentum impurity scattering is shown to be responsible for an incoherent
regime of resonant tunneling processes. These new insights into the crucial
role of impurity scattering open a new route of improvement of terahertz

$\sigma$. The \emph{subsequence automaton} of $S$ (often called the
\emph{directed acyclic subsequence graph}) is the minimal deterministic finite
automaton accepting all subsequences of $S$. A straightforward construction
shows that the size (number of states and transitions) of the subsequence
automaton is $O(n\sigma)$ and that this bound is asymptotically optimal.
  In this paper, we consider subsequence automata with \emph{default
transitions}, that is, special transitions to be taken only if none of the
regular transitions match the current character, and which do not consume the
current character. We show that with default transitions, much smaller
subsequence automata are possible, and provide a full trade-off between the
size of the automaton and the \emph{delay}, i.e., the maximum number of
consecutive default transitions followed before consuming a character.
  Specifically, given any integer parameter $k$, $1 < k \leq \sigma$, we
present a subsequence automaton with default transitions of size
$O(nk\log_{k}\sigma)$ and delay $O(\log_k \sigma)$. Hence, with $k = 2$ we
obtain an automaton of size $O(n \log \sigma)$ and delay $O(\log \sigma)$. On
the other extreme, with $k = \sigma$, we obtain an automaton of size $O(n
\sigma)$ and delay $O(1)$, thus matching the bound for the standard subsequence
automaton construction. Finally, we generalize the result to multiple strings.
The key component of our result is a novel hierarchical automata construction

for mid 2020s will be in the multi Gbit/s range per connection for the
innermost detector layers. This paper reports on first tests on the possible
use of carbon cables for electrical data transmission close to the interaction
point. Carbon cables have the potential advantage of being light, having a low
activation and easy integration into the detector components close to the
interaction point. In these tests commercially available carbon cables were
used, in which the filaments had a very thin nickel coating. For these cables
data rates beyond 1 Gbit/s over more than 1m with an error rate of less than
10^{-12} could be transmitted. The characteristics of the cables have been
measured in terms of S-parameters and could be reproduced with a Spice model.
Some outlook on potential further improvements is presented.

not much attention has been given to exploring new interesting behavior that
can be generated with the different types of non-Newtonian fluids with
non-constant viscosity. Going in this direction, this paper introduces a
computational model for simulating the interesting phenomena observed in
non-Newtonian shear thickening fluids, which are fluids where the viscosity
increases with increased stress. These fluids have unique and unconventional
behavior, and they often appear in real world scenarios such as when sinking in
quicksand or when experimenting with popular cornstarch and water mixtures.
While interesting behavior of shear thickening fluids can be easily observed in
the real world, the most interesting phenomena of these fluids have not been
simulated before in computer graphics. The fluid exhibits unique phase changes
between solid and liquid states, great impact resistance in its solid state and
strong hysteresis effects. Our proposed approach builds on existing
non-Newtonian fluid models in computer graphics and introduces an efficient
history-based stiffness term that is essential to produce the most interesting
shear thickening phenomena. The history-based stiffness is formulated through
the use of fractional derivatives, leveraging the fractional calculus ability
to depict both the viscoelastic behavior and the history effects of
history-dependent systems. Simulations produced by our method are compared
against real experiments and the results demonstrate that the proposed model
successfully captures key phenomena observed in shear thickening fluids.

must be used. We Bosonize the model and obtain chiral Bosons for each spin on
the edge of the disk. When the filling fraction is reduced to
$\nu=\frac{k_{F}}{k_{so}}=\frac{1}{3}$ the electron- electron interactions are

Prisoner's Dilemma sparked a surge of interest in the surprising fact that a
player can exert unilateral control over iterated interactions. These
remarkable strategies, however, are known to exist only in games in which
players choose between two alternative actions such as ""cooperate"" and
""defect."" Here we introduce a broader class of autocratic strategies by
extending zero-determinant strategies to iterated games with more general
action spaces. We use the continuous Donation Game as an example, which
represents an instance of the Prisoner's Dilemma that intuitively extends to a
continuous range of cooperation levels. Surprisingly, despite the fact that the
opponent has infinitely many donation levels from which to choose, a player can
devise an autocratic strategy to enforce a linear relationship between his or
her payoff and that of the opponent even when restricting his or her actions to
merely two discrete levels of cooperation. In particular, a player can use such
a strategy to extort an unfair share of the payoffs from the opponent.
Therefore, although the action space of the continuous Donation Game dwarfs
that of the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, players can still devise relatively
simple autocratic and, in particular, extortionate strategies.

(SR) are well established, yet carry deep implications that remain hard to
visualize. This paper presents a new graphical interpretation of the geometry
of SR that may, by complementing the standard works, aid the understanding of
SR and its fundamental principles in a more intuitive way. From the axiom that
the velocity of light remains constant to any inertial observer, the geodesic
is presented as a line of constant angle on the complex plane across a set of
diverging reference frames. The resultant curve is a logarithmic spiral, and
this view of the geodesic is extended to illustrate the relativistic Doppler
effect, time dilation, length contraction, the twin paradox, and relativistic
radar distance in an original way, whilst retaining the essential mathematical
relationships of SR. Using a computer-generated graphical representation of
photon trajectories allows a visual comparison between the relativistic
relationships and their classical counterparts, to visualize the consequences
of SR as velocities become relativistic. The model may readily be extended to
other situations, and may be found useful in presenting a fresh understanding
of SR through geometric visualization.

nontrivial commutation relations of the components of the variables of the
quantized theory with the components of the corresponding canonical conjugated
momenta referring to other space-time directions. The corresponding commutation
relations are formulated by using quaternions. At the beginning, this extended
quantization concept is applied to the variables of quantum mechanics. The
resulting Dirac equation and the corresponding generalized expression for plane
waves are formulated and some consequences for quantum field theory are
considered. Later, the quaternionic quantization principle is transferred to
canonical quantum gravity. Within quantum geometrodynamics as well as the
Ashtekar formalism the generalized algebraic properties of the operators
describing the gravitational observables and the corresponding quantum
constraints implied by the generalized representations of these operators are
determined. The generalized algebra also induces commutation relations of the
several components of the quantized variables with each other. Finally, the
quaternionic quantization procedure is also transferred to $\mathcal{N}=1$
supergravity. Accordingly, the quantization principle has to be generalized to
be compatible with Dirac brackets, which appear in canonical quantum
supergravity.
