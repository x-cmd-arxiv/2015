(EELRs) around two compact steep-spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies, 3C~268.3 and
3C~303.1, in order to identify the contribution of photoionization and
shock-ionization. We perform a new spectroscopical (long-slit) analysis with
GMOS/Gemini with the slit oriented in the radio-jet direction, where outflows
are known to exist. The [Ne V]$\lambda 3426$ emission is the most interesting
feature of the spectra and the key to breaking the degeneracy between the
models: since this emission-line is more extended than HeII, it challenges the
ionization structure proposed by any photoionization model, also its intensity
relative to H$\beta$ does not behave as expected with respect to the ionization
parameter U in the same scenario. On the contrary, when it is compared to the
intensity of [OII]$\lambda3727$/H$\beta$ and all these results are joined, the
whole scenario is plausible to be explained as emission coming from the hot,
compressed, shocked gas in shock-ionization models. Although the model fitting
is strongly sensitive to the chosen line-ratios, it argues for the presence of
external and strong ionizing fields, such as the precursor field created by the
shock or/and the AGN radiation field. In this paper, we show how AGN
photoionization and shock-ionization triggered by jet-cloud interaction work
together in these EELRs in order to explain the observed trends and line-ratio
behaviours in a kinematically acceptable way.

we found that the implicit and self-organizing structure of developer

that: (a) developers form scale-free networks, in which the majority of

(b) developers tend to accumulate coordination requirements with more and more
developers over time, presumably limited by an upper bound, and (c) initially
developers are hierarchically arranged, but over time, form a hybrid structure,
in which core developers are hierarchically arranged and peripheral developers
are not. Our results suggest that the organizational structure of large

benefits of developer coordination, and the mechanisms used to achieve this
state depend on the project's scale.

measured data has been among the most important but challenging topics in
modern science and engineering, with great potential of application in
structural system identification, updating and development of high fidelity
models. These problems in principle can be tackled using a Bayesian
probabilistic approach, where the parameters to be identified are treated as
uncertain and their inference information are given in terms of their posterior
(i.e., given data) probability distribution. For complex models encountered in
applications, efficient computational tools robust to the number of uncertain
parameters in the problem are required for computing the posterior statistics,
which can generally be formulated as a multi-dimensional integral over the
space of the uncertain parameters. Subset Simulation (SuS) has been developed
for solving reliability problems involving complex systems and it is found to
be robust to the number of uncertain parameters. An analogy has been recently
established between a Bayesian updating problem and a reliability problem,
which opens up the possibility of efficient solution by SuS. The formulation,
called BUS (Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability methods), is based on
conventional rejection principle. Its theoretical correctness and efficiency
requires the prudent choice of a multiplier, which has remained an open
question. Motivated by the choice of the multiplier and its philosophical role,
this paper presents a study of BUS. The work leads to a revised formulation
that resolves the issues regarding the multiplier so that SuS can be
implemented without knowing the multiplier. Examples are presented to
illustrate the theory and applications.

  Perfect Bayesian Equilibria and Sequential Decomposition",,,,,"cs.GT cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We formulate and analyze a general class of stochastic dynamic games with
asymmetric information arising in dynamic systems. In such games, multiple
strategic agents control the system dynamics and have different information
about the system over time. Because of the presence of asymmetric information,
each agent needs to form beliefs about other agents' private information.
Therefore, the specification of the agents' beliefs along with their strategies
is necessary to study the dynamic game. We use Perfect Bayesian equilibrium
(PBE) as our solution concept. A PBE consists of a pair of strategy profile and
belief system. In a PBE, every agent's strategy should be a best response under
the belief system, and the belief system depends on agents' strategy profile
when there is signaling among agents. Therefore, the circular dependence
between strategy profile and belief system makes it difficult to compute PBE.
Using the common information among agents, we introduce a subclass of PBE
called common information based perfect Bayesian equilibria (CIB-PBE), and
provide a sequential decomposition of the dynamic game. Such decomposition
leads to a backward induction algorithm to compute CIB-PBE. We illustrate the
sequential decomposition with an example of a multiple access broadcast game.
We prove the existence of CIB-PBE for a subclass of dynamic games.

together by the large intra-atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Using inelastic
neutron scattering on the archetypal 4d-electron Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$,
we report a novel form of excitonic magnetism in the intermediate-strength
regime of the SOC. The magnetic order is characterized by ``soft'' magnetic
moments with large amplitude fluctuations manifested by an intense, low-energy
excitonic mode analogous to the Higgs mode in particle physics. This mode
heralds a proximate quantum critical point separating the soft magnetic order
driven by the superexchange interaction from a quantum-paramagnetic state
driven by the SOC. We further show that this quantum critical point can be
tuned by lattice distortions, and hence may be accessible in epitaxial
thin-film structures. The unconventional spin-orbital-lattice dynamics in
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ identifies the SOC as a novel source of quantum criticality in

  Consensus with Switching Topologies and Additive Noises","36 pages, 0 figure",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consensus conditions and convergence speeds are crucial for distributed
consensus algorithms of networked systems. Based on a basic first-order
average-consensus protocol with time-varying topologies and additive noises,
this paper first investigates its critical consensus condition on network
topology by stochastic approximation frameworks. A new joint-connectivity
condition called extensible joint-connectivity that contains a parameter
$\delta$ (termed the extensible exponent) is proposed. With this and a balanced
topology condition, we show that a critical value of $\delta$ for consensus is
$1/2$. Optimization on convergence rate of this protocol is further
investigated. It is proved that the fastest convergence rate, which is the
theoretic optimal rate among all controls, is of the order $1/t$ for the best
topologies, and is of the order $1/t^{1-2\delta}$ for the worst topologies
which are balanced and satisfy the extensible joint-connectivity condition. For
practical implementation, certain open-loop control strategies are introduced
to achieve consensus with a convergence rate of the same order as the fastest
convergence rate. Furthermore, a consensus condition is derived for non
stationary and strongly correlated random topologies. The algorithms and
consensus conditions are applied to distributed consensus computation of mobile
ad-hoc networks; and their related critical exponents are derived from relative
velocities of mobile agents for guaranteeing consensus.

that a user did not consume, are taken into consideration. But this assumption
does not accord with the common sense understanding that users have a limited

certain paper, or might live too far away from a restaurant to experience it.
In the language of causal analysis, the assignment mechanism (i.e., the items
that a user is exposed to) is a latent variable that may change for various
user/item combinations. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach
that directly incorporates user exposure to items into collaborative filtering.
The exposure is modeled as a latent variable and the model infers its value
from data. In doing so, we recover one of the most successful state-of-the-art

conflict points where vehicle paths cross in the future. At every time step,
the supervisor determines whether there will be more than one vehicle in the

collision is detected, and the supervisor overrides the drivers to avoid
collision. A major challenge in the design of a supervisor as opposed to an
autonomous vehicle controller is to verify whether future collisions will occur

hard due to the large number of vehicles often involved in intersection
collision, to the multitude of conflict points, and to the vehicles dynamics.
In order to solve the verification problem, we translate the problem to a
job-shop scheduling problem that yields equivalent answers. The job-shop
scheduling problem can, in turn, be transformed into a mixed-integer linear
program when the vehicle dynamics are first-order dynamics, and can thus be

variable, and we call such a curve a \emph{liquidity risk profile}. The shape
of a liquidity risk profile is intimately linked with the tail behavior of the

measures. We exploit this link to systematically bound liquidity risk profiles
from above by other real functions $\gamma$, deriving tractable necessary and
sufficient conditions for \emph{concentration inequalities} of the form
$\rho(\lambda X) \le \gamma(\lambda)$, for all $\lambda \ge 0$. These
concentration inequalities admit useful dual representations related to
transport inequalities, and this leads to efficient uniform bounds for
liquidity risk profiles for large classes of $X$. On the other hand, some
modest new mathematical results emerge from this analysis, including a new
characterization of some classical transport-entropy inequalities. Lastly, the
analysis is deepened by means of a surprising connection between time

emission-line galaxies when only a single emission line is detected
spectroscopically. We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift
Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified
via an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our
Bayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line
luminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy
populations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE
given the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for
the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to
classify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]
emitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our
Bayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom
cutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and
incompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the
two types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the
probability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our
simulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological
distance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to
recovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object
labels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in
large-scale structure analyses. It can be applied to narrowband emission-line

4-point functions containing scalars charged under global symmetries. We show
the existence of large spin double-twist operators in various representations
of the global symmetry group. We then compute their anomalous dimensions in
terms of the central charge $C_T$, current central charge $C_J$, and the OPE
coefficients of low dimension scalars. In AdS, these results correspond to the
binding energy of two-particle states arising from the exchange of gravitons,
gauge bosons, and light scalar fields. Using unitarity and crossing symmetry,
we show that gravity is universal and attractive among different types of
two-particle states, while the gauge binding energy can have either sign as
determined by the representation of the two-particle state, with universal
ratios fixed by the symmetry group. We apply our results to 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$
SQCD and the 3D O(N) vector models. We also show that in a unitary CFT, if the
current central charge $C_J$ stays finite when the global symmetry group
becomes infinitely large, such as the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit of the O(N)
vector model, then the theory must contain an infinite number of higher spin
currents.

paper, we explore a class of 5-dimensional natural SUSY theories in which SUSY
is broken by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We pedagogically explain how
Scherk-Schwarz elegantly solves the traditional problems of 4-dimensional SUSY
theories (based on the MSSM and its many variants) that usually result in an
unsettling level of fine-tuning. The minimal Scherk-Schwarz set up possesses
novel phenomenology, which we briefly outline. We show that achieving the
observed physical Higgs mass motivates extra structure that does not
significantly affect the level of tuning (always better than $\sim 10\%$) and
we explore three qualitatively different extensions: the addition of extra
matter that couples to the Higgs, an extra $U(1)^\prime$ gauge group under
which the Higgs is charged and an NMSSM-like solution to the Higgs mass

clusters to explore relationships between halo mass, AGN feedback, and central
cooling time. We find that radio--mechanical feedback power (referred to here
as ""AGN power"") in central cluster galaxies correlates with halo mass as
P$_{\rm mech}$ $\propto$ M$^{1.55\pm0.26}$, but only in halos with central
atmospheric cooling times shorter than 1 Gyr. The trend of AGN power with halo
mass is consistent with the scaling expected from a self-regulating AGN
feedback loop, as well as with galaxy and central black hole co-evolution along
the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ relation. AGN power in clusters with central
atmospheric cooling times longer than $\sim 1$ Gyr typically lies two orders of
magnitude below those with shorter central cooling times. Galaxies centred in
clusters with long central cooling times nevertheless experience ongoing and
occasionally powerful AGN outbursts. We further investigate the impact of
feedback on cluster scaling relations. We find $L-T$, and $M-T$ relations in
clusters with direct evidence of feedback which are steeper than self-similar,
but not atypical compared to previous studies of the full cluster population.
While the gas mass rises, the stellar mass remains nearly constant with rising
total mass, consistent with earlier studies. This trend is found regardless of
central cooling time, implying tight regulation of star formation in central
galaxies as their halos grew, and long-term balance between AGN heating and
atmospheric cooling. Our scaling relations are presented in forms that can be
incorporated easily into galaxy evolution models.

the Crab pulsar at energies above 400 GeV. Methods: We analyzed $\sim$320 hours
of good quality data of Crab with the MAGIC telescope, obtained from February
2007 until April 2014. Results: We report the most energetic pulsed emission
ever detected from the Crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 TeV. The pulse profile
shows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the GeV energy
range. The spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functions
from 70 GeV up to 1.5 TeV and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above
10 GeV by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board of the Fermi satellite. When
making a joint fit of the LAT and MAGIC data, above 10 GeV, the photon indices
of the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. Conclusions: We measured with the MAGIC
telescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. Such TeV
pulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a Lorentz factor
of at least $5\times 10^6$. These results strongly suggest IC scattering off
low energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production region
in the vicinity of the light cylinder.

redshift accuracy for galaxies brighter than $H_{F140W}<24$ with an
unprecedented and representative high-redshift galaxy sample. We find an
average scatter of $0.0197\pm0.0003(1+z)$ in the Skelton et al. (2014)
photometric redshifts. Photometric redshift accuracy decreases with magnitude
and redshift, but does not vary monotonically with color or stellar mass. The
1-$\sigma$ scatter lies between $0.01-0.03$(1+z) for galaxies of all masses and
colors below $z<2.5$ (for $H_{F140W}{<}24$), with the exception of a population
of very red ($U-V > 2$), dusty star-forming galaxies for which the scatter
increases to $\sim0.1(1+z)$. Although the overall photometric redshift accuracy
for quiescent galaxies is better than for star-forming galaxies, scatter
depends more strongly on magnitude and redshift than on galaxy type. We verify
these trends using the redshift distributions of close pairs and extend the
analysis to fainter objects, where photometric redshift errors further increase
to $\sim0.046(1+z)$ at $H_{F160W}=26$. We demonstrate that photometric redshift
accuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiple
filter combinations. We evaluate the widths of redshift probability
distribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by a
factor of $\sim1.1-1.6$, but that uniformly broadening the distribution does
not adequately account for fitting outliers. Finally, we suggest possible
applications of these data in planning for current and future surveys and
simulate photometric redshift performance in the LSST, DES, and combined DES
and VHS surveys.

based on the projected neighbour density of neighbours found in both SDSS and

only observed when defining environment based on the SDSS reference catalogue,
not 2MRS. We interpret these results as meaning that the local environment is
the dominant cause of the shift in $M_{*}$, and that the larger scales that
2MRS probes (compared to SDSS) are almost irrelevant. In addition, we also use
a fixed aperture method to probe environment, and find tentative evidence that
HI-deficiency depresses the value of $M_{*}$ in the highest density regions. We
find no significant dependence of the low-mass slope on environment in any
test, using either method. Tensions between these results and those from the

deliberately targeted beam. If neutron star mergers do have detectable prompt
radio emissions, a coincident search with the GW detector network and

by analysing previously reported magnetization [Y. Kono {\it et al.}, Phys.

[H. K\""uhne {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 80}, 045110 (2009)]. The scaling of
magnetization is demonstrated through collapsing the data for a range of both
temperature and field onto a single curve without making any assumption for a
theoretical form. The data collapse is subsequently shown to closely follow the
theoretically-predicted scaling function without any adjustable parameters.
Experimental boundaries for the quantum critical region could be drawn from the
variable range beyond which the scaled data deviate from the theoretical
function. Similarly to the magnetization, quantum critical scaling of the
thermal expansion is also demonstrated. Further, the spin dynamics probed via
NMR relaxation rate $1/T_1$ close to the saturation is shown to follow the
theoretically-predicted quantum critical behavior as $1/T_1\propto T^{-0.5}$
persisting up to temperatures as high as $k_\mathrm{B}T \simeq J$, where $J$ is
the exchange coupling constant.

solar system following long-term storage in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud
reservoirs. These reservoirs feed several distinct, short-lived ""small body""
populations. Here, we present new measurements of the optical colors of
cometary and comet-related bodies including long-period (Oort cloud) comets,
Damocloids (probable inactive nuclei of long-period comets) and Centaurs
(recent escapees from the Kuiper belt and precursors to the Jupiter family
comets). We combine the new measurements with published data on short-period
comets, Jovian Trojans and Kuiper belt objects to examine the color systematics
of the comet-related populations. We find that the mean optical colors of the
dust in short-period and long-period comets are identical within the
uncertainties of measurement, as are the colors of the dust and of the
underlying nuclei. These populations show no evidence for scattering by
optically-small particles or for compositional gradients, even at the largest
distances from the Sun, and no evidence for ultrared matter. Consistent with
earlier work, ultrared surfaces are common in the Kuiper belt and on the
Centaurs, but not in other small body populations, suggesting that this
material is hidden or destroyed upon entry to the inner solar system. The onset
of activity in the Centaurs and the disappearance of the ultrared matter in
this population begin at about the same perihelion distance ($\sim$10 AU),
suggesting that the two are related. Blanketing of primordial surface materials
by the fallback of sub-orbital ejecta, for which we calculate a very short
timescale, is the likely mechanism. The same process should operate on any
mass-losing body, explaining the absence of ultrared surface material in the
entire comet population.

We find a total of 32 RR Lyrae stars (24 ab-type, 8 c-type) and 75 Cepheid
variables. The mean periods of the ab-type and c-type RR Lyrae stars are
calculated to be $\langle$P$_{\mathrm{ab}}\rangle = 0.609\pm0.011$ and
$\langle$P$_{\mathrm{c}}\rangle = 0.359\pm0.025$ days, respectively. The light
curve properties of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars yield a mean
metallicity of $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = -1.63$\pm$0.11 dex for this ancient
population, consistent with a recent synthetic colour-magnitude diagram
analysis. We find this galaxy to be Oosterhoff-intermediate and lacking in
high-amplitude, short-period ab-type RR Lyrae, consistent with behavior
recently observed for many dwarf spheroidals and ultra-faint dwarfs in the
Local Group. We find a distance modulus of $\mu = 25.07\pm 0.12$ as determined
by the RR Lyrae stars, slightly larger but agreeing with recent distance
estimates from the red giant branch tip. We also find a sizable population of
Cepheid variables in this galaxy. We provide evidence in favor of most if not
all of these stars being short-period classical Cepheids. Assuming all of these
stars to be classical Cepheids, we find that most of these Cepheids are
$\sim$300 Myr old, with the youngest Cepheids being offset from the older
Cepheids and the centre of the galaxy. We conclude that this may have resulted
from a migration of star formation in DDO210.

the thickness is larger than a critical value, the cross-section of the everted

eversion-induced mechanical instability in an elastomer tube has been reported
several decades ago, a satisfying explanation of the phenomenon is still
unavailable. In all previous studies, linear stability analyses have been
commonly adopted to predict the critical thickness of the tube for the
eversion-induced instability. The discrepancy between the prediction and
experiment is significant and well known. In this letter, based on the
experiments and theoretical analyses, we show that crease formation on the
inner surface of an everted tube is the mechanical instability mode, which
cannot be captured by linear stability analyses. Instead, a combination of
energetic analyses and numerical simulation of highly nonlinear deformation
enables us to correctly predict both the critical thickness of the tube for the
onset of creases and the profile of the cross-section of an everted tube with
multiple creases on its inner surface.

$\mathcal{H}$-matrix schemes rely on low-rank approximations of the underlying
kernel function. For high-frequency problems, the ranks grow rapidly as the
mesh is refined, and standard techniques are no longer attractive.
  Directional compression techniques solve this problem by using decompositions
based on plane waves. Taking advantage of hierarchical relations between these
waves' directions, an efficient approximation is obtained.
  This paper is dedicated to directional $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices that employ
local low-rank approximations to handle directional representations
efficiently.
  The key result is an algorithm that takes an arbitrary matrix and finds a
quasi-optimal approximation of this matrix as a directional
$\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix using a prescribed block tree. The algorithm can reach
any given accuracy, and the approximation requires only $\mathcal{O}(n k +
\kappa^2 k^2 \log n)$ units of storage, where $n$ is the matrix dimension,
$\kappa$ is the wave number, and $k$ is the local rank. In particular, we have
a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n k)$ if $\kappa$ is constant and $\mathcal{O}(n
k^2 \log n)$ for high-frequency problems characterized by $\kappa^2 \sim n$.
  Since the algorithm can be applied to arbitrary matrices, it can serve as the
foundation of fast techniques for constructing preconditioners.

observed in spectral lines of O VI, Fe X, Fe XII, Fe XIV, Fe XV, Fe XVI, Fe
XVII, Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV. The EIS observations were made coincident with hard
X-ray bursts observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic

different wavelengths show a spatial coincidence of features in the RHESSI

near-loop-top regions. A complex array of phenomena was observed including
multiple evaporation regions and the surge, which was also observed by the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescopes.
The slit of the EIS spectrometer covered several flare footpoint regions from
which evaporative upflows in Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV lines were observed with
Doppler speeds greater than 500 km s$^{-1}$. For ions such as Fe XV both
evaporative outflows (~200 km s$^{-1}$) and downflows (~30-50 km s$^{-1}$) were
observed. Non-thermal motions from 120 to 300 km s$^{-1}$ were measured in
flare lines. In the surge, Doppler speeds are found from about 0 to over 250 km
s$^{-1}$ in lines from ions such as Fe XIV. The non-thermal motions could be
due to multiple sources slightly Doppler-shifted from each other or turbulence
in the evaporating plasma. We estimate the energetics of the hard X-ray burst
and obtain a total flare energy in accelerated electrons of
$\geq7\times10^{28}$ ergs. This is a lower limit because only an upper limit
can be determined for the low energy cutoff to the electron spectrum. We find
that detailed modeling of this event would require a multi-threaded model due

traversibility satisfy the energy conditions for suitable choices of parameters

low-mass stars, their long axes tend to be either parallel or perpendicular to
the large-scale (10-100 pc) magnetic field (B-field) in the surrounding inter
cloud medium. This arises because, along the dynamically dominant B-fields, the
competition between self-gravity and turbulent pressure will shape the cloud to
be elongated either perpendicular or parallel to the fields. Recent study also
suggested that, on the scales of 0.1-0.01 pc, fields are dynamically important
within cloud cores forming massive stars. But whether the core field
morphologies are inherited from the inter cloud medium or governed by cloud
turbulence is under vigorous debate, so is the role played by B-fields in cloud
fragmentation at 10 - 0.1 pc scales. Here we report B-field maps covering
100-0.01 pc scales inferred from polarimetric observations of a massive-star
forming region, NGC 6334. First, the main filament also lies perpendicular to
the ambient field. NGC 6334 hosts young star-forming sites where fields are not
severely affected by stellar feedback, and their directions do not change
significantly over the entire scale range. This means that the fields are
dynamically important. At various scales, we find that the hourglass-shaped
field lines are pinched where the gas column density peaks and the field
strength is proportional to the 0.4-power of the density. We conclude that
B-fields play a crucial role in the fragmentation of NGC 6334.

Energy transparency is a concept that makes a program's energy consumption
visible from software to hardware through the different system layers. Such
transparency can enable energy optimizations at each layer and between layers,
and help both programmers and operating systems make energy aware decisions.
The common methodology of extracting the energy consumption of a program is
through direct measurement of the target hardware. This usually involves
specialized equipment and knowledge most programmers do not have. In this
paper, we examine how existing methods for static resource analysis and energy
modeling can be utilized to perform Energy Consumption Static Analysis (ECSA)
for deeply embedded programs. To investigate this, we have developed ECSA
techniques that work at the instruction set level and at a higher level, the
LLVM IR, through a novel mapping technique. We apply our ECSA to a
comprehensive set of mainly industrial benchmarks, including single-threaded
and also multi-threaded embedded programs from two commonly used concurrency
patterns, task farms and pipelines. We compare our ECSA results to hardware
measurements and predictions obtained based on simulation traces. We discuss a
number of application scenarios for which ECSA results can provide energy
transparency and conclude with a set of new research questions for future work.

every $e \in K_n$ that completes a new infected copy of $H$ in $K_n$. We say
that $G$ percolates if eventually every edge in $K_n$ is infected. The extremal
question about the size of the smallest percolating sets when $H = K_r$ was
answered independently by Alon, Kalai and Frankl. Here we consider a different
question raised more recently by Bollob\'as: what is the maximum time the
process can run before it stabilizes? It is an easy observation that for $r=3$
this maximum is $\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil $. However, a new phenomenon occurs
for $r=4$ when, as we show, the maximum time of the process is $n-3$. For $r

demonstrate by showing that the $K_r$-bootstrap process can run for at least

(PIC) algorithm in a Lorentz boosted frame, the plasma is drifting
relativistically at $\beta_b c$ towards the laser, which can lead to a
computational speedup of $\sim \gamma_b^2=(1-\beta_b^2)^{-1}$. Meanwhile, when
LWFA is modeled in the quasi-3D geometry in which the electromagnetic fields
and current are decomposed into a limited number of azimuthal harmonics,
speedups are achieved by modeling three dimensional problems with the
computation load on the order of two dimensional $r-z$ simulations. Here, we
describe how to combine the speed ups from the Lorentz boosted frame and
quasi-3D algorithms. The key to the combination is the use of a hybrid Yee-FFT
solver in the quasi-3D geometry that can be used to effectively eliminate the
Numerical Cerenkov Instability (NCI) that inevitably arises in a Lorentz
boosted frame due to the unphysical coupling of Langmuir modes and EM modes of
the relativistically drifting plasma in these simulations. In addition, based
on the space-time distribution of the LWFA data in the lab and boosted frame,
we propose to use a moving window to follow the drifting plasma to further
reduce the computational load. We describe the details of how the NCI is
eliminated for the quasi-3D geometry, the setups for simulations which combine
the Lorentz boosted frame and quasi-3D geometry, the use of a moving window,
and compare the results from these simulations against their corresponding lab
frame cases. Good agreement is obtained, particularly when there is no
self-trapping, which demonstrates it is possible to combine the Lorentz boosted

between facial image quality features (like pose, illumination direction, etc)
and face recognition performance. Such a model can be used to predict the
performance of a face recognition system. Since the model is based solely on
image quality features, performance predictions can be done even before the
actual recognition has taken place thereby facilitating many preemptive action.
A practical limitation of such a data driven generative model is the limited
nature of training data set. To address this limitation, we have developed a
Bayesian approach to model the distribution of recognition performance measure
based on the number of match and non-match scores in small regions of the image
quality space. Random samples drawn from these models provide the initial data
essential for training the generative model. Experiment results based on six
face recognition systems operating on three independent data sets show that the
proposed performance prediction model can accurately predict face recognition
performance using an accurate and unbiased Image Quality Assessor (IQA).
Furthermore, our results show that variability in the unaccounted quality space
-- the image quality features not considered by the IQA -- is the major factor
causing inaccuracies in predicted performance.

density is depleted near the wall and an interface similar to that between the
liquid and its vapor is formed. This analogy suggests that the composition of
the binary liquid near this interface should exhibit spatial modulation similar
to that near a liquid-vapor interface even if the interactions of the wall with
the two components of the liquid are the same. The Guggenheim adsorption
relation quantifies the concentrations of two components of a binary mixture
near a liquid-vapor interface and qualitatively states that the majority
(minority) component enriches the interface for negative (positive) mixing
energy if the surface tensions of the two components are not very different.
From molecular dynamics simulations of binary mixtures with different
compositions and interactions, we find that the Guggenheim relation is
qualitatively satisfied at wall-induced interfaces for systems with negative
mixing energy at all state points considered. For systems with positive mixing
energy, this relation is found to be qualitatively valid at low densities,
while it is violated at state points with high density where correlations in
the liquid are strong. This observation is validated by a calculation of the
density profiles of the two components of the mixture using density functional
theory with the Ramakrishnan-Yussouff free-energy functional. Possible reasons
for the violation of the Guggenheim relation are discussed.

Hydrodynamic (GHD) model used for representing visco-elastic fluid systems. The
incompressible limit of the model which supports transverse shear wave mode is
studied in detail. In particular dipole structures are observed to emit
transverse shear waves in both the limits of sub and super - luminar
propagation, where the structures move slower and faster than the phase
velocity of the shear waves, respectively. In the sub - luminar limit the
dipole gets engulfed within the shear waves emitted by itself, which then
backreacts on it and ultimately the identity of the structure is lost. However,
in the super - luminar limit the emission appears like a wake from the tail
region of the dipole. The dipole, however, keeps propagating forward with
little damping but minimal distortion in its form. A Poynting like conservation
law with radiative, convective and dissipative terms being responsible for the
evolution of W , which is similar to `enstrophy' like quantity in normal
hydrodynamic fluid systems, has also been constructed for the incompressible
GHD equations. The conservation law is shown to be satisfied in all the cases
of evolution and collision amidst the nonlinear structures to a great accuracy.
It is shown that monopole structures which do not move at all but merely
radiate shear waves, the radiative term and dissipative losses solely
contribute to the evolution of W. The, dipolar structures, on the other hand,
propagate in the medium and hence convection also plays an important role in
the evolution of W.

secure multi-party computation. In oblivious transfer protocols a user sends
one or more messages to a receiver, while the sender remains oblivious as to
which messages have been received. Protocols for oblivious transfer cannot
exist in a classical or fully-quantum world, but can be implemented by
restricting the users' power.
  The isolated qubits model is a cryptographic model in which users are
restricted to single-qubit operations and are not allowed to use entangling
operations. Furthermore, all parties are allowed to store qubits for a long
time before measuring them.
  In this model, a secure single-bit one-out-of-two randomised oblivious
transfer protocol was recently presented by Liu. Motivated by this result, we
construct a protocol for secure string one-out-of-two randomised oblivious
transfer by simplifying and generalising the existing proof.
  We then study for the first time interactive protocols for more complex
two-party functionalities in this model based on the security of our
construction. In order to guarantee the composability of our construction,
users are restricted to measurement at the end of each sub-protocol. It is then
possible to construct secure one-out-of-two and one-out-of-k oblivious transfer
protocols in the isolated qubits model.
  Moreover, we study secure password-based identification, where a user
identifies himself to another user by evaluating the equality function on their
inputs, or passwords. We use the oblivious transfer constructions mentioned
above as sub-protocols to construct a secure identification protocol.
  Finally, we prove that constructing a secure identification protocol
non-interactively is impossible, even using oblivious transfer.

the model is based solely on image quality features, it can predict performance

stability is resilience: ecosystems asymptotic rate of return to equilibrium
after a pulse-perturbation $-$or shock. A complementary notion of growing
popularity is reactivity: the strongest initial response to shocks. On the
other hand, empirical stability is often quantified as the inverse of temporal
variability, directly estimated on data, and reflecting ecosystems response to
persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is unclear whether and
how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity. Here, we
establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures
belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them
intrinsic, stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively defined as
the inverse of the strongest stationary response to white-noise and to
single-frequency perturbations. We prove that they predict ecosystems worst
response to broad classes of disturbances, including realistic models of
environmental fluctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures between
resilience and reactivity and that, although defined with respect to persistent
perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a
shock, making them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We
argue that invariability measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the
challenges ahead to further unify theoretical and empirical approaches to
stability.

based approaches are usually thwarted by computational challenges posed by
large datasets. We construct a novel class of scalable Dynamic Nearest Neighbor
Gaussian Process (DNNGP) models that can provide a sparse approximation to any

(SMCOs) residing in galactic centers are black holes. In particular, the Milky
Way's SMCO can be a giant nontopological soliton, Q-ball, made of a scalar
field: this fits perfectly all observational data. Similar but tiny Q-balls
produced in the early Universe may constitute, partly or fully, the dark
matter. This picture explains in a natural way, why our SMCO has very low
accretion rate and why the observed angular size of the corresponding radio
source is much smaller than expected. Interactions between dark-matter Q-balls
may explain how SMCOs were seeded in galaxies and resolve well-known problems
of standard (non-interacting) dark matter.

impurity in the center of a trapped $^{87}\text{Rb}$ Bose-Einstein condensate.
Within a zero-temperature mean-field description we provide a one-dimensional
physical intuitive model which involves two coupled differential equations for
the condensate and the impurity wave function, which we solve numerically. With
this we determine within the equilibrium phase diagram spanned by the intra-
and inter-species coupling strength, whether the impurity is localized at the
trap center or expelled to the condensate border. In the former case we find
that the impurity induces a bump or dip on the condensate for an attractive or
a repulsive Rb-Cs interaction strength, respectively. Conversely, the
condensate environment leads to an effective mass of the impurity which
increases quadratically for small interspecies interaction strength.
Afterwards, we investigate how the impurity imprint upon the condensate wave
function evolves for two quench scenarios. At first we consider the case that
the harmonic confinement is released. During the resulting time-of-flight
expansion it turns out that the impurity-induced bump in the condensate wave
function starts decaying marginally, whereas the dip decays with a
characteristic time scale which decreases with increasing repulsive
impurity-BEC interaction strength. Secondly, once the attractive or repulsive
interspecies coupling constant is switched off, we find that white-shock waves
or bi-solitons emerge which both oscillate within the harmonic confinement with
a characteristic frequency.

linear group and E(A) is its elementary subgroup. Since then, various

for a range of classical and algebraic like-groups, mostly in relation to
subnormal subgroups of these groups. The major classical theorems and methods

models. However, they suffer from data sparseness in high-dimensional space

suggest a partial dimension reduction adaptive-to-model testing procedure that
can be omnibus against general global alternative models although it fully use
the dimension reduction structure under the null hypothesis. This feature is
because that the procedure can automatically adapt to the null and alternative
models, and thus greatly overcomes the dimensionality problem. Second, to
achieve the above goal, we propose a ridge-type eigenvalue ratio estimate to
automatically determine the number of linear combinations of the covariates
under the null and alternatives. Third, a Monte-Carlo approximation to the
sampling null distribution is suggested. Unlike existing bootstrap
approximation methods, this gives an approximation as close to the sampling
null distribution as possible by fully utilising the dimension reduction model
structure under the null. Simulation studies and real data analysis are then
conducted to illustrate the performance of the new test and compare it with
existing tests.

consider real-valued time series relative to measurements of an underlying
dynamical system that evolves through time. We assume that such a dynamical
process is predictable to a certain degree by means of a class of recurrent
networks called Echo State Network (ESN), which are capable to model a generic
dynamical process. In order to isolate the superimposed (multi)fractal
component of interest, we define a data-driven filter by leveraging on the ESN
prediction capability to identify the trend component of a given input time
series. Specifically, the (estimated) trend is removed from the original time
series and the residual signal is analyzed with the multifractal detrended
fluctuation analysis procedure to verify the correctness of the detrending
procedure. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique,
we consider several synthetic time series consisting of different types of
trends and fractal noise components with known characteristics. We also process
a real-world dataset, the sunspot time series, which is well-known for its
multifractal features and has recently gained attention in the complex systems
field. Results demonstrate the validity and generality of the proposed
detrending method based on ESNs.

Siegel","Finding Golden Nuggets by Reduction","28 pages",,,,"math.CO math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a class of normal play partizan games, called Complementary
Subtraction. Let $A$ denote your favorite set of positive integers. This is
Left's subtraction set, whereas Right subtracts numbers not in $A$. The Golden
Nugget Subtraction Game has the $A$ and $B$ sequences, from Wythoff's game, as
the two complementary subtraction sets. As a function of the heap size, the
maximum size of the canonical forms grows quickly. However, the value of the
heap is either a number or, in reduced canonical form, a switch. We find the
switches by using properties of the Fibonacci word and standard Fibonacci
representations of integers. Moreover, these switches are invariant under
shifts by certain Fibonacci numbers. The values that are numbers, however, are
distinct, and we find a polynomial time bit characterization for them, via the
ternary Fibonacci representation.

by isometries on a CAT(0) space $X$ and a cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$ generated

the existence of a finitely generated subgroup of the direct product of two
free groups $\mathbb F_2\times \mathbb F_2$ without the bounded packing
property answering a question of Hruska-Wise. We also prove the existence of
finitely presented subgroups of CAT(0) groups without bounded packing using
Wise's {\em modified Rip's construction} and the {\bf 1-2-3} theorem of

theory is via a Chen-Fliess functional expansion or Fliess operator. The
general goal of this paper is to describe how to approximate Fliess operators
with iterated sums and to provide accurate error estimates for two different
scenarios, one where the series coefficients are growing at a local convergence
rate, and the other where they are growing at a global convergence rate. In
each case, it is shown that the error estimates are achievable in the sense
that worst case inputs can be identified which hit the error bound. The paper
then focuses on the special case where the operators are rational, i.e., they
have rational generating series. It is shown in this situation that the
iterated sum approximation can be realized by a discrete-time state space model
which is a rational function of the input and state affine. In addition, this
model comes from a specific discretization of the bilinear realization of the
rational Fliess operator.

a time-dependent Euler equation for non-rigid body dynamics. The central idea
is that after reduction the twisting motion is apparent in a body frame, while
the somersaulting (rotation about the fixed angular momentum vector in space)
is recovered by a combination of dynamic and geometric phase. In the simplest
""kick-model"" the number of somersaults $m$ and the number of twists $n$ are
obtained through a rational rotation number $W = m/n$ of a (rigid) Euler top.
This rotation number is obtained by a slight modification of Montgomery's
formula [9] for how much the rigid body has rotated. Using the full model with
shape changes that take a realistic time we then derive the master
twisting-somersault formula: An exact formula that relates the airborne time of
the diver, the time spent in various stages of the dive, the numbers $m$ and
$n$, the energy in the stages, and the angular momentum by extending a
geometric phase formula due to Cabrera [3]. Numerical simulations for various
dives agree perfectly with this formula where realistic parameters are taken
from actual observations.

stationary states can be used as a model for galaxies in the framework of the

Dark Matter Problem. Here we discuss an improvement of this work. In fact, as
the star density is a functional of the invariants of the associated Vlasov
equation, we show that any of these invariants is in its turn a functional of
the local energy and the angular momentum. As a consequence, the star density
depends only on these two integrals of the Vlasov system. This result is known
as the ""Jeans theorem"". In addition, we find an analogous of the historical
Tolman- Oppenheimer-Volkov equation for the system considered in this paper.
For the sake of completeness, in the final Section of the paper we consider two
additional models which argue that Dark Matter could not be an essential
