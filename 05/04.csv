addressed. An objective function is introduced which measures the average
number of bits that are needed for the network to encode its state. When this
is minimised, it is shown that this leads to a number of results, such as
topographic mappings, piecewise linear dependence on the input of the
probability of a neuron firing, and factorial encoder networks.

substitution tilings constructed by inflation and the arithmetic of positional

  It introduces a generalization of inflationary tessellations to equivalence
classes of tiles. Two tiles belong to the same class if they share a defined
geometric property, such as equivalence under a group of isometries, having the
same measure, or having the same `decoration'. Some properties of ordinary
tessellations for which the equivalence relation is congruence with respect to
the full group of isometries are already determined by the weaker relation of
equivalence with respect to equal measure. In particular, the multiplier for an
inflationary tiling (such as a Penrose aperiodic tiling) is an algebraic
number.
  Equivalence of tiles under measure facilitates the investigation of
properties of tilings that are independent of dimension, and provides a method
for transferring tilings from one dimension to another.
  Three well-known aperiodic tilings illustrate aspects of the correspondence:
a tiling of Ammann, a Penrose tiling, and the monotiling of Taylor and
Socolar-Taylor.

inter-vehicular distance (known as platoon) allows to lower the overall
aerodynamic drag and, therefore, to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions. However, due to the large mass and limited engine power of HDVs,
slopes have a significant impact on the feasible and optimal speed profiles
that each vehicle can and should follow. Therefore maintaining a short
inter-vehicular distance as required by platooning without coordination between
vehicles can often result in inefficient or even unfeasible trajectories. In
this paper we propose a two-layer control architecture for HDV platooning aimed
to safely and fuel-efficiently coordinate the vehicles in the platoon. Here,
the layers are responsible for the inclusion of preview information on road
topography and the real-time control of the vehicles, respectively. Within this
architecture, dynamic programming is used to compute the fuel-optimal speed
profile for the entire platoon and a distributed model predictive control
framework is developed for the real-time control of the vehicles. The
effectiveness of the proposed controller is analyzed by means of simulations of
several realistic scenarios that suggest a possible fuel saving of up to 12%
for the follower vehicles compared to the use of standard platoon controllers.

in play falls in for a hit, before running. When a ball is hit in the air, the
baserunner will usually wait, to gather additional information as to whether a
ball will fall for a hit before deciding to run aggressively. This additional
information guarantees that there will not be a double play and an ""unnecessary
out"". However, waiting could potentially cost the runner the opportunity to
reach third base, or even scoring on the play if the ball falls for a hit. This
in turn affects the probability of scoring at least one run henceforth in the
inning. We create a new statistic, the baserunning risk threshold (BRT), which
measures the minimum probability with which the baserunner should be sure that
a ball in play will fall in for a hit, before running without waiting to see if
the ball will be caught, with the goal of scoring at least one run in the
inning. We measure a 0-out and a 1-out version of BRT, both in aggregate, and
also in high leverage situations, where scoring one run is particularly
important. We show a drop in BRT for pitchers who pitch in more high leverage
innings, and a very low BRT on average for ""elite closers"". It follows that
baserunners should be frequently running without waiting, and getting thrown
out in double plays regularly to maximize their chances of scoring at least one
run.

when the available spectrum is not contiguous due to the presence of external
interference sources. Non-contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(NC-OFDM) is a promising technique to utilize such disjoint frequency bands in
an efficient manner. In this paper we study the problem of fair spectrum
allocation across multiple NCOFDM-enabled point-to-point cognitive radio links
under certain practical considerations that arise from such non-contiguous
access. When using NC-OFDMA, the channels allocated to a cognitive link are
spread across several disjoint frequency bands leading to a large spectral span
for that link. Increased spectral span requires higher sampling rates, leading
to increased power consumption in the ADC/DAC of the transmit/receive nodes. In
this context, this paper proposes a spectrum allocation that maximizes the
minimum rate achieved by the cognitive radio links, under a constraint on the
maximum permissible spectral span. Under constant transmit powers and
orthogonal spectrum allocation, such an optimization is a mixed-integer linear
program and can be solved efficiently. There exists a clear trade-off between
the max-min rate achieved and the maximum permissible spectral span. The
spectral allocation obtained from the proposed optimization framework is shown
to be close to the tradeoff boundary, thus showing the effectiveness of the
proposed technique. We find that it is possible to limit the spectrum span
without incurring a significant penalty on the max-min rate under different
interference environments. We also discuss an experimental evaluation of the
techniques developed here using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)

(VQA). Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task
is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world
scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and
answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of
an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a
system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of
the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions.
Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended
answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be
provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing ~0.25M
images, ~0.76M questions, and ~10M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the
information it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided
and compared with human performance. Our VQA demo is available on CloudCV

clustering (KSC), an approach to clustering cast within a kernel-based
optimization setting. KSC represents a least-squares support vector machine
based formulation of spectral clustering described by a weighted kernel PCA
objective. Just as in the classifier case, the binary clustering model is
expressed by a hyperplane in a high dimensional space induced by a kernel. In
addition, the multi-way clustering can be obtained by combining a set of binary
decision functions via an Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) encoding scheme.
Because of its model-based nature, the KSC method encompasses three main steps:
training, validation, testing. In the validation stage model selection is
performed to obtain tuning parameters, like the number of clusters present in
the data. This is a major advantage compared to classical spectral clustering
where the determination of the clustering parameters is unclear and relies on
heuristics. Once a KSC model is trained on a small subset of the entire data,
it is able to generalize well to unseen test points. Beyond the basic
formulation, sparse KSC algorithms based on the Incomplete Cholesky
Decomposition (ICD) and $L_0$, $L_1, L_0 + L_1$, Group Lasso regularization are
reviewed. In that respect, we show how it is possible to handle large scale
data. Also, two possible ways to perform hierarchical clustering and a soft
clustering method are presented. Finally, real-world applications such as image
segmentation, power load time-series clustering, document clustering and big
data learning are considered.

the Lagrangian can be written in an explicit covariant fashion, and turns out
to be the geodesic Lagrangian of a curved Lorentzian manifold. Therefore, any

study is motivated by recent experiments on synthetic and biological swimmers
in microfluidic \textit{Hele-Shaw} type geometries. Under such confinement, a
swimmer's hydrodynamic signature is that of a potential source dipole, and the
long-range interactions among swimmers are obtained from the superposition of
dipole singularities. Here, we recall the equations governing the positions and
orientations of interacting asymmetric swimmers in doubly-periodic domains, and
focus on the dynamics of swimmer pairs. We obtain two families of `relative
equilibria'-type solutions that correspond to pursuit and synchronization of
the two swimmers, respectively. Interestingly, the pursuit mode is stable for
large tail swimmers whereas the synchronization mode is stable for large head
swimmers. These results have profound implications on the collective behavior
reported in several recent studies on populations of confined microswimmers.

globular clusters, authors usually assume a static potential for our Galaxy
with parameters that appear at the present-day. According to the standard
paradigm of galaxy formation, galaxies grow through a continuous accretion of
fresh gas and a hierarchical merging with smaller galaxies from high redshift
to the present day. This implies that the mass and size of disc, bulge, and
halo change with time. We investigate the effect of assuming a live Galactic
potential on the orbital history of halo objects and its consequences on their
internal evolution. We numerically integrate backwards the equations of motion
of different test objects located in different Galactocentric distances in both
static and time-dependent Galactic potentials in order to see if it is possible
to discriminate between them. We show that in a live potential, the birth of
the objects, 13 Gyr ago, would have occurred at significantly larger
Galactocentric distances, compared to the objects orbiting in a static
potential. Based on the direct N-body calculations of star clusters carried out
with collisional N-body code, NBODY6, we also discuss the consequences of the
time-dependence of a Galactic potential on the early- and long-term evolution
of star clusters in a simple way, by comparing the evolution of two star
clusters embedded in galactic models, which represent the galaxy at present and
12 Gyr ago, respectively. We show that assuming a static potential over a
Hubble time for our Galaxy as it is often done, leads to an enhancement of
mass-loss, an overestimation of the dissolution rates of globular clusters, an
underestimation of the final size of star clusters, and a shallower stellar
mass function.

model of mean-field coupled phase rotators, subject to white noise and quenched
frequencies. We analyse the influence of the fluctuations of both thermal noise
and frequencies (seen as a disorder) on a large but finite population of $N$
rotators, in the case where the law of the disorder is symmetric. On a finite
time scale $[0, T]$, the system is known to be self-averaging: the empirical
measure of the system converges as $N\to \infty$ to the deterministic solution
of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation which exhibits a stable manifold of
synchronized stationary profiles for large interaction. On longer time scales,
competition between the finite-size effects of the noise and disorder makes the
system deviate from this mean-field behavior. In the main result of the paper
we show that on a time scale of order $ \sqrt{N}$ the fluctuations of the
disorder prevail over the fluctuations of the noise: we establish the existence
of disorder-induced traveling waves for the empirical measure along the
stationary manifold. This result is proved for fixed realizations of the
disorder and emphasis is put on the influence of the asymmetry of these
quenched frequencies on the direction and speed of rotation of the system.
Asymptotics on the drift are provided in the limit of small disorder.

comparison, we considered the two cases that are the transport in the presence

conductance and shot noise exhibit essentially different features in the two

tunneling channels contributing to the transport when the superconducting gate
is applied. The dependence of the shot noise behavior on the potential strength
and the width of the superconducting barrier differs in the two cases. In the
presence of the specular Andreev reflection, the shot noise spectrum is more
sensitive to the potential strength and the width of the superconducting
barrier. In both of the two cases, total transmission occurs at a certain
parameter setting, which contributes greatly to the conductance and suppresses
the shot noise at the same time.

freeways. The proposed toll mechanism is broken up into two parts: (1) the
supply side feedback control that computes the desired split ratios for the
incoming traffic flows between the general purpose and the toll lanes; and (2)
the demand side price setting algorithm that aims to enforce the computed split
ratios.
  The split ratio controller is designed and tested in the context of the
link-node Cell Transmission Model with the modified node model of in/out flow
distribution. The equilibrium structure of this traffic model is presented; and
the case, in which the existence of a toll lane is meaningful, is discussed.
  For the price setting, two alternative approaches are presented. The first
one is commonly used, and it relies on the known Value of Time (VoT)
distribution. Its shortcoming, however, is in the difficulty of the VoT
distribution estimation. The second approach employs the auction mechanism,
where travelers make bids on places in the toll lane. The advantage of this
approach is that it enables direct control over how many vehicles will be
allowed into the toll lane.

during X-class flares observed by the GONG and HMI instruments, and the hard

changes to the coronal restructuring and investigate the origin of the field
changes. We find that spatially the early RHESSI emission corresponds well to
locations of the strong field changes. The field changes occur predominantly in
the regions of strong magnetic field near the polarity inversion line (PIL).
The later RHESSI emission does not correspond to significant field changes as
the flare footpoints are moving away from the PIL. Most of the field changes
start before or around the start time of the detectable HXR signal, and they
end at about the same time or later than the detectable HXR flare emission.
Some of the field changes propagate with speed close to that of the HXR
footpoint at a later phase of the flare. The propagation of the field changes
often takes place after the strongest peak in the HXR signal when the
footpoints start moving away from the PIL, i.e. the field changes follow the
same trajectory as the HXR footpoint, but at an earlier time. Thus, the field
changes and HXR emission are spatio-temporally related but not co-spatial nor
simultaneous. We also find that in the strongest X-class flares the amplitudes
of the field changes peak a few minutes earlier than the peak of the HXR
signal. We briefly discuss this observed time delay in terms of the formation
of current sheets during eruptions.

be fairly degenerate in mass with the leptoquark while the other right-handed

channel, the role of Coulomb interaction may significantly modify the energy
levels of an electron pair at low temperatures as the channel becomes wide. In
this regime, the Coulomb effect on the orbital triplet and singlet
electron-pair state is calculated and found to lead to four split energy
levels, including two hybrid and two unhybrid states. Moreover, due to the
interplay of hybrid and unhybrid Coulomb interactions between two electrons,
our calculations reveal that the ground pair-state will switch from one hybrid
orbit-triplet state (strong confinement) to the unhybrid orbit-singlet state
(intermediate confinement) as the channel width gradually increases and then
back to the original hybrid orbit-triplet state (weak confinement), due to
larger total spin of the orbit-singlet state, as the channel width becomes
larger than a threshold value. This switching behavior leaves a footprint in
the conductance as well as in the diffusion thermoelectric power of electrons.
Here, the predicted reoccurrence of the hybrid orbit-triplet state (spin-$0$
state) as a ground state is shown to relate to the higher spin degeneracy of
the spin-$1$ state as well as to the strong Coulomb repulsion in the central
region of the channel, which separates two electrons away and pushes them to
different channel edges. The conductance reoccurrence region expands from the
weak to the intermediate confinement regime with increasing linear electron
density.

understand the tradeoff in the reconstruction error due to sampling
probabilities, (ii) exhibits more insights than existing error bounds that
exploit specific probability distributions, and (iii) implies better sampling
distributions. In particular, we show that a sampling distribution with
probabilities proportional to the square root of the statistical leverage
scores is always better than uniform sampling and is better than leverage-based
sampling when the statistical leverage scores are very nonuniform. And by
solving a constrained optimization problem related to the error bound with an
efficient bisection search we are able to achieve better performance than using
either the leverage-based distribution or that proportional to the square root
of the statistical leverage scores. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
benefits of the new sampling distributions for low-rank matrix approximation

determined in detail using rather elementary algebraic, geometric and analytic
methods applied to the closed quadratic algebra of symmetries of the system. We
treat a family of 2nd order degenerate systems: oscillator analogies on
Darboux, nonzero constant curvature, and flat spaces, related to one another
via contractions, and obeying Kepler's laws. Then we treat two 2nd order
nondegenerate systems, an analogy of a caged Coulomb problem on the 2-sphere
and its contraction to a Euclidean space caged Coulomb problem. In all cases
the symmetry algebra structure provides detailed information about the
trajectories. An interesting example is the occurrence of ''metronome orbits'',
trajectories confined to an arc rather than a loop, which are indicated clearly
from the structure equations but might be overlooked using more traditional
methods. We also treat the Post-Winternitz system, an example of a classical
4th order superintegrable system that cannot be solved using separation of

theorem for elliptic functions, whose constants of the motion are only rational
in the momenta, a system of special interest because its constants of the

three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. It is shown that $v$ is regular if
the angular velocity $v_\theta$ satisfies an integral condition which is
critical under the standard scaling. This condition allows functions satisfying
\[ |v_\theta(x, t)| \le \frac{C}{r |\ln r|^{2+\epsilon}}, \quad r<1/2, \] where
$r$ is the distance from $x$ to the axis, $C$ and $\epsilon$ are any positive
constants.
  Comparing with the critical a priori bound \[ |v_\theta(x, t)| \le
\frac{C}{r}, \qquad 0< r \le 1/2, \]our condition is off by the log factor
$|\ln r|^{2+\epsilon}$ at worst. This is inspired by the recent interesting
paper \cite{CFZ:1} where H. Chen, D. Y. Fang and T. Zhang establish, among
other things, an almost critical regularity condition on the angular velocity.
Previous regularity conditions are off by a factor $r^{-1}$.
  The proof is based on the new observation that, when viewed differently, all
the vortex stretching terms in the 3 dimensional axially symmetric
Navier-Stokes equations are critical instead of supercritical as commonly
believed.

lateral corrections are necessary when using multichannel models; (c) whether
multichannel dosimetry produces better results than single-channel dosimetry;
(d) which multichannel perturbation model provides more accurate film doses. It
was found that scanning prior to irradiation and applying lateral corrections
improved the accuracy of the results. For some perturbation models, increasing
the number of color channels did not result in more accurate film doses.
Employing Truncated Normal perturbations was found to provide better results
than using Micke-Mayer perturbation models.} Among the models being compared,
the triple-channel model with Truncated Normal perturbations, net optical

obtain the phase diagrams in the temperature vs pore width plane, including the
isotropic-cholesteric transition, the winding transitions and their complex
relationship. In particular, the structure of winding transitions terminates at
the capillary isotropic-cholesteric transition via triple points where the
confined isotropic phase coexists with two cholesterics with different helix

complementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the AGN host
galaxy properties. The active sample appears to have no bias in terms of AGN
type, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is two
orders of magnitude greater for the Seyfert 2s. In the luminosity range spanned
by the sample, log L_{14-195keV} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscured
and X-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65%. The similarity of these fractions to
more distant spectroscopic AGN samples, although over a limited luminosity
range, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. Our
sample confirms that X-ray unabsorbed Seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not more
than a few percent of the Seyfert 2 population. At higher luminosities, the
optically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dust
sublimation radius), but the X-ray absorbed fraction changes little. We argue
that the cold X-ray absorption in these Seyfert 1s can be accounted for by
neutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (BLR)
emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-exists
with the BLR and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.

signatures of a second scalar doublet at the LHC are usually limited to models
with a very restricted Yukawa structure. Strong correlations between the scalar
couplings to fermions are fixed in these models due to the underlying flavour
principle, making the results obtained from such analyses highly model
dependent. Moreover, constraints derived from flavour experiments also vary
radically within the different models considered. The hypothesis of Yukawa
alignment provides a suitable framework to perform a more general analysis of
125 GeV boson data and searches for additional scalars at the LHC, allowing for
sizable new physics effects to be observed in the scalar sector while
accommodating the stringent limits from flavour experiments at the same time.

clear detection in accretion-powered X-ray pulsars is still lacking. We use the
Pizzochero snowplow model for pulsar glitches as well as starquake models to
determine for the first time the expected properties of glitches in accreting
pulsars and their observability. Since some accreting pulsars show
accretion-induced long-term spin-up, we also investigate the possibility that
anti-glitches occur in these stars. We find that glitches caused by quakes in a
slow accreting neutron star are very rare and their detection extremely
unlikely. On the contrary, glitches and anti-glitches caused by a transfer of
angular momentum between the superfluid neutron vortices and the non-superfluid
component may take place in accreting pulsars more often. We calculate the
maximum jump in angular velocity of an anti-glitch and we find that it is
expected to be about 1E-5 - 1E-4 rad/s. We also note that since accreting
pulsars usually have rotational angular velocities lower than those of isolated
glitching pulsars, both glitches and anti-glitches are expected to have long
rise and recovery timescales compared to isolated glitching pulsars, with
glitches and anti-glitches appearing as a simple step in angular velocity.
Among accreting pulsars, we find that GX 1+4 is the best candidate for the
detection of glitches with currently operating X-ray instruments and future
missions such as the proposed Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT).

AGN are produced in an accretion disk and an embedded hot corona respectively.
The inverse Compton scattering of disk photons by hot electrons in the corona
can effectively cool the coronal gas if the mass supply is predominantly via a
cool disk like flow as in BHXRBs. Thus, the application of such a model to AGNs
fails to produce their observed X-ray emission. As a consequence, a fraction of
disk accretion energy is usually assumed to be transferred to the corona. To
avoid this assumption, we propose that gas in a vertically extended
distribution is supplied to a supermassive black hole by the gravitational
capture of interstellar medium or stellar wind material. In this picture, the
gas partially condenses to an underlying cool disk as it flows toward the black
hole, releasing accretion energy as X-ray emission and supplying mass for the
disk accretion. Detailed numerical calculations reveal that the X-ray
luminosity can reach a few tens of percent of the bolometric luminosity. The
value of $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ varies from 0.9 to 1.2 for the mass supply rate
ranging from 0.03 to 0.1 times the Eddington value. The corresponding photon
index in the 2-10 keV energy band varies from 1.9 to 2.3. Such a picture
provides a natural extension of the model for low luminosity AGN where
condensation is absent at low mass accretion rates and no optically thick disk
exists in the inner region.

multiarmed bandit models. Bandit problems are classes of online learning
problems that capture exploration versus exploitation tradeoffs. In a
multiarmed bandit model, players can pick among many arms, and each play of an
arm generates an i.i.d. reward from an unknown distribution. The objective is
to design a policy that maximizes the expected reward over a time horizon for a
single player setting and the sum of expected rewards for the multiplayer
setting. In the multiplayer setting, arms may give different rewards to
different players. There is no separate channel for coordination among the
players. Any attempt at communication is costly and adds to regret. We propose
two decentralizable policies, $\tt E^3$ ($\tt E$-$\tt cubed$) and $\tt
E^3$-$\tt TS$, that can be used in both single player and multiplayer settings.
These policies are shown to yield expected regret that grows at most as
O($\log^{1+\epsilon} T$). It is well known that $\log T$ is the lower bound on
the rate of growth of regret even in a centralized case. The proposed
algorithms improve on prior work where regret grew at O($\log^2 T$). More
fundamentally, these policies address the question of additional cost incurred
in decentralized online learning, suggesting that there is at most an
$\epsilon$-factor cost in terms of order of regret. This solves a problem of
relevance in many domains and had been open for a while.

the emergence of melt-enriched sheets (bands in cross-section) that are aligned
at about 15-20 degrees to the shear plane. Deformation and deviatoric stress
also cause the coherent alignment of pores at the grain scale. This leads to a
melt-preferred orientation that may, in turn, give rise to an anisotropic
permeability. Here we develop a simple, general model of anisotropic
permeability in partially molten rocks. We use linearised analysis and
nonlinear numerical solutions to investigate its behaviour under simple-shear
deformation. In particular, we consider implications of the model for the
emergence and angle of melt-rich bands. Anisotropic permeability affects the
angle of bands and, in a certain parameter regime, it can give rise to low
angles consistent with experiments. However, the conditions required for this
regime have a narrow range and seem unlikely to be entirely met by experiments.
Anisotropic permeability may nonetheless affect melt transport and the
behaviour of partially molten rocks in Earth's mantle.

mass). We find that Liller 1 is significantly less concentrated (concentration
parameter c=1.74) and less extended (tidal radius r_t=298"" and core radius

the second highest collision rate (after Terzan 5) among all star clusters in

at a fixed rate $R_{0}$, and it is intended for the user. The secret message is

on sparse local features and hypergraph matching. We benefit from special
properties of the temporal domain in the data to derive a sequential and fast
graph matching algorithm for GPUs.
  Traditionally, graphs and hypergraphs are frequently used to recognize
complex and often non-rigid patterns in computer vision, either through graph
matching or point-set matching with graphs. Most formulations resort to the
minimization of a difficult discrete energy function mixing geometric or
structural terms with data attached terms involving appearance features.
Traditional methods solve this minimization problem approximately, for instance
with spectral techniques.
  In this work, instead of solving the problem approximatively, the exact
solution for the optimal assignment is calculated in parallel on GPUs. The
graphical structure is simplified and regularized, which allows to derive an
efficient recursive minimization algorithm. The algorithm distributes
subproblems over the calculation units of a GPU, which solves them in parallel,
allowing the system to run faster than real-time on medium-end GPUs.

problem of user identification and CSI estimation as a block sparse signal
recovery problem in compressive sensing (CS). Using existing CS block recovery
algorithms, we first obtain the identity of the strong users and then estimate
their CSI using the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). To minimize the
effect of noise on the estimated CSI, we introduce a back-off strategy that
optimally backs-off on the noisy estimated CSI and derive the error covariance
matrix of the post-detection noise. In addition to this, we provide exact
closed form expressions for the average maximum equivalent SNR at the

drastically reduces the feedback air-time and achieves a rate close to that
obtained by scheduling schemes that require dedicated error-free feedback from

generally detected in the edge-on view, but it has been recently demonstrated
that barlenses, which are lens-like structures embedded in bars, are the more
face-on counterparts of the B/P bulges. Multi-component structural
decompositions have shown that B/P/barlens structures are likely to account for
most of the bulge light, including the early-type disks harboring most of the
bulge mass in galaxies. Cool central disks are often embedded in the
B/P/barlens bulges. Barred galaxies contain also dynamically hot classical
bulges, but it is not yet clear to what extent they are really dynamically
distinct structure components, and to what extent stars wrapped into the
central regions of the galaxies during the formation and evolution of bars. If
most of the bulge mass in the Milky Way mass galaxies in the nearby universe
in- deed resides in the B/P-shape bulges, and not in the classical bulges, that
idea needs to be integrated into the paradigm of galaxy formation.

is less than the 401 Hz spin frequency. The difference between the ~410 Hz QPO
frequency and the spin frequency follows a similar frequency correlation as the
low frequency power spectral components, suggesting that the ~410 Hz QPO is a
retrograde beat against the spin frequency of a rotational phenomenon in the 9
Hz range. Comparing this 9 Hz beat feature with the Low-Frequency QPO in SAX
J1808.4-3658 and other neutron star sources, we conclude that these two might

retrograde precession due to a combination of relativistic, classical and
magnetic torques. Additionally we present two new measurements of the lower kHz

supergiant stars (BSG) links their absolute magnitude to the spectroscopically
determined flux-weighted gravity log g = Teff^4. BSG are the brightest stars in
the universe at visual light and the application of the FGLR has become a
powerful tool to determine extragalactic distances. Observationally, the FGLR
is a tight relationship with only small scatter. It is, therefore, ideal to be
used as a constraint for stellar evolution models. The goal of this work is to
investigate whether stellar evolution can reproduce the observed FGLR and to
develop an improved foundation of the FGLR as an extragalactic distance
indicator. We use different grids of stellar models for initial masses between
9 and 40 Msun, for metallicities between Z = 0.002 and 0.014, with and without
rotation, computed with various mass loss rates during the red supergiant
phase. For each of these models we discuss the details of post-main sequence
evolution and construct theoretical FGLRs by means of population synthesis
models which we then compare with the observed FGLR. In general, the stellar
evolution model FGLRs agree reasonably well with the observed one. There are,
however, differences between the models, in particular with regard to the shape
and width (scatter) in the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity plane. The best
agreement is obtained with models which include the effects of rotation and
assume that the large majority, if not all the observed BSG evolve towards the
red supergiant phase and only a few are evolving back from this stage. The
effects of metallicity on the shape and scatter of the FGLR are small. (...)

presence of two light stops may give rise to final states which are not so

very precise theory and experiment, it allows a much higher resolution of short

astronomy, especially when the objects are not point-like. At radio wavelengths
an object can have several components corresponding, for example, to a core and
lobes. {Considering not all radio detections correspond to visible or infrared
sources, matching these catalogs can be challenging.} Traditionally this is
done by eye for better quality, which does not scale to the large data volumes
expected from the next-generation of radio telescopes. We present a novel
automated procedure, using Bayesian hypothesis testing, to achieve reliable
associations by explicit modelling of a particular class of radio-source
morphology. {The new algorithm not only assesses the likelihood of an
association between data at two different wavelengths, but also tries to assess
whether different radio sources are physically associated, are double-lobed
radio galaxies, or just distinct nearby objects.} Application to the SWIRE and
ATLAS CDF-S catalogs shows that this method performs well without human
intervention.

high plasma temperature and previous measurements of UV variability and

study the long term variability of their X-ray emission and found that the

of arbitrary spin states. Following a theoretical and experimental

various DD protocols. We identify that the optimal control scheme for
preserving an arbitrary spin state is a recursive protocol, the concatenated
version of the XY8 pulse sequence. The improved spin coherence might have an
immediate impact on improvements of the sensitivities of AC magnetometry.
Moreover, the protocol can be used on denser diamond samples to increase

isocurvature perturbations, are generally well constrained by cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data. A less probed mode is the compensated isocurvature
perturbation (CIP), a fluctuation in the relative number densities of cold dark
matter and baryons. In the curvaton model, a subdominant field during inflation
later sets the primordial curvature fluctuation $\zeta$. In some curvaton-decay
scenarios, the baryon and cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations nearly
cancel, leaving a large CIP correlated with $\zeta$. This correlation can be
used to probe these CIPs more sensitively than the uncorrelated CIPs considered
in past work, essentially by measuring the squeezed bispectrum of the CMB for
triangles whose shortest side is limited by the sound horizon. Here, the
sensitivity of existing and future CMB experiments to correlated CIPs is
assessed, with an eye towards testing specific curvaton-decay scenarios. The
planned CMB Stage 4 experiment could detect the largest CIPs attainable in
curvaton scenarios with more than 3$\sigma$ significance. The significance
could improve if small-scale CMB polarization foregrounds can be effectively
subtracted. As a result, future CMB observations could discriminate between
some curvaton-decay scenarios in which baryon number and dark matter are
produced during different epochs relative to curvaton decay. Independent of the
specific motivation for the origin of a correlated CIP perturbation,
cross-correlation of CIP reconstructions with the primary CMB can improve the
signal-to-noise ratio of a CIP detection. For fully correlated CIPs the
improvement is a factor of $\sim$2$-$3.

low-mass main-sequence stars. We find that coronal temperature is related to Fx
by Tcor=0.11 Fx^0.26, where Tcor is in MK and Fx is in erg/s/cm^2.

necessarily last forever as they can either fade gradually with time, resulting
in link aging, or terminate abruptly, causing link deletion, as even old
friendships may cease. In this paper, we study a social network formation model
where we introduce several ways by which a link termination takes place. If we
adopt the link aging, we get a more modular structure with more homogeneously
distributed link weights within communities than when link deletion is used. By
investigating distributions and relations of various network characteristics,
we find that the empirical findings are better reproduced with the link
deletion model. This indicates that link deletion plays a more prominent role
in organizing social networks than link aging.

simulate electronic conduction in molecular wires under thermal effects induced

can properly replicate different transport mechanisms: phase coherent
nonresonant tunneling, ballistic behavior, and hopping conduction, to provide
results consistent with experiments. Specifically, our simulations with the
probe method recover the following central characteristics of charge transfer
in molecular wires: (i) The electrical conductance of short wires falls off
exponentially with molecular length, a manifestation of the tunneling
(superexchange) mechanism. Hopping dynamics overtakes superexchange in long
wires demonstrating an ohmic-like behavior. (ii) In off-resonance situations,
weak dephasing effects facilitate charge transfer. Under large dephasing the
electrical conductance is suppressed. (iii) At high enough temperatures,
$k_BT/\epsilon_B>1/25$, with $\epsilon_B$ as the molecular-barrier height, the
current is enhanced by a thermal activation (Arrhenius) factor. However, this
enhancement takes place for both coherent and incoherent electrons and it does
not readily indicate the underlying mechanism. (iv) At finite-bias, dephasing
effects impede conduction in resonant situations. We further show that memory
(non-Markovian) effects can be implemented within the Landauer-B\""uttiker's
probe technique to model the interaction of electrons with a structured
environment. Finally, we examine experimental results of electron transfer in
conjugated molecular wires and show that our computational approach can
reasonably reproduce reported values to provide mechanistic information.

quasi-stationary sources over block fading channels by studying encoder and
decoder buffering techniques to smooth out the source and channel variations.
Four source and channel coding schemes that consider buffer and power
constraints are presented to minimize the reconstructed source distortion. The
first one is a high performance scheme, which benefits from optimized source
and channel rate adaptation. In the second scheme, the channel coding rate is
fixed and optimized along with transmission power with respect to channel and
source variations; hence this scheme enjoys simplicity of implementation. The
two last schemes have fixed transmission power with optimized adaptive or fixed
channel coding rate. For all the proposed schemes, closed form solutions for
mean distortion, optimized rate and power are provided and in the high SNR
regime, the mean distortion exponent and the asymptotic mean power gains are
derived. The proposed schemes with buffering exploit the diversity due to
source and channel variations. Specifically, when the buffer size is limited,
fixed channel rate adaptive power scheme outperforms an adaptive rate fixed
power scheme. Furthermore, analytical and numerical results demonstrate that
with limited buffer size, the system performance in terms of reconstructed
signal SNR saturates as transmission power is increased, suggesting that
appropriate buffer size selection is important to achieve a desired
reconstruction quality.

chance. The objective of the present work is to describe affinity maturation of
B lymphocytes (in which random events are perhaps the most characteristic), and
to study a possible network model of immune memory. In our model stochastic
processes govern all events. A major novelty of this approach is that it
permits studying random variations in the immune process. Four basic components
are simulated in the model: non-immune self cells, nonself cells (pathogens), B
lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells that produce naive B lymphocytes. A point in
a generalized shape space plus the size of the corresponding population
represents nonself and non-immune self cells. On the other hand, each
individual B cell is represented by a disc that models its recognition region
in the shape space. Infection is simulated by an ""injection"" of nonself cells
into the system. Division of pathogens may instigate an attack of naive B
cells, which in turn may induce clonal proliferation and hypermutation in the
attacking B cells, and which eventually may slow down and stop the exponential
growth of pathogens. Affinity maturation of newly produced B cells becomes
expressed as a result of selection when the number of pathogens decreases.
Under favorable conditions, the expanded primary B cell clones may stimulate
the expansion of secondary B cell clones carrying complementary receptors to
the stimulating B cells. Like in a hall of mirrors, the image of pathogens in
the primary B cell clones then will be reflected in secondary B cell clones.
This ""ping-pong"" game may survive for a long time even in the absence of the
pathogen, creating a local network memory. This memory ensures that repeated
infection by the same pathogen will be eliminated more efficiently.

variables (SIIRVs). For $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$, a $k$-SIIRV of order $n \in
\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ is the probability distribution of the sum of $n$ independent
random variables each supported on $\{0, 1, \dots, k-1\}$. We denote by ${\cal
S}_{n,k}$ the set of all $k$-SIIRVs of order $n$.
  In this paper, we tightly characterize the sample and computational
complexity of learning $k$-SIIRVs. More precisely, we design a computationally
efficient algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(k/\epsilon^2)$ samples, and learns
an arbitrary $k$-SIIRV within error $\epsilon,$ in total variation distance.
Moreover, we show that the {\em optimal} sample complexity of this learning
problem is $\Theta((k/\epsilon^2)\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)}).$ Our algorithm
proceeds by learning the Fourier transform of the target $k$-SIIRV in its
effective support. Its correctness relies on the {\em approximate sparsity} of
the Fourier transform of $k$-SIIRVs -- a structural property that we establish,
roughly stating that the Fourier transform of $k$-SIIRVs has small magnitude
outside a small set.
  Along the way we prove several new structural results about $k$-SIIRVs. As
one of our main structural contributions, we give an efficient algorithm to
construct a sparse {\em proper} $\epsilon$-cover for ${\cal S}_{n,k},$ in total
variation distance. We also obtain a novel geometric characterization of the
space of $k$-SIIRVs. Our characterization allows us to prove a tight lower
bound on the size of $\epsilon$-covers for ${\cal S}_{n,k}$, and is the key
ingredient in our tight sample complexity lower bound.
  Our approach of exploiting the sparsity of the Fourier transform in
distribution learning is general, and has recently found additional
applications.

reported as a ratio between yields in a given multiplicity interval normalised
to the multiplicity-integrated ones (relative yields). They are shown as a
function of the multiplicity of charged particles normalised to the average
value for inelastic collisions (relative charged-particle multiplicity). D$^0$,
D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$ mesons are measured in five $p_{\rm T}$ intervals from 1 to
20 GeV/$c$ and for $|y|<0.5$ via their hadronic decays. The D-meson relative
yield is found to increase with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. For
events with multiplicity six times higher than the average multiplicity of
inelastic collisions, a yield enhancement of a factor about 15 relative to the
multiplicity-integrated yield in inelastic collisions is observed. The yield
enhancement is independent of transverse momentum within the uncertainties of
the measurement. The D$^0$-meson relative yield is also measured as a function
of the relative multiplicity at forward pseudorapidity. The non-prompt
J/$\psi$, i.e. the B hadron, contribution to the inclusive J/$\psi$ production
is measured in the di-electron decay channel at central rapidity. It is
evaluated for $p_{\rm T}>1.3$ GeV/$c$ and $|y|<0.9$, and extrapolated to
$p_{\rm T}>0$. The fraction of non-prompt J/$\psi$ in the inclusive J/$\psi$
yields shows no dependence on the charged-particle multiplicity at central
rapidity. Charm and beauty hadron relative yields exhibit a similar increase
with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are compared to
PYTHIA 8, EPOS 3 and percolation calculations.

fixed-point iterative methods, and $\lim_{m\to\infty}\xx_m$ are simply the

extrapolation methods. Two types of methods exist in the literature: polynomial
type methods and epsilon algorithms. In most applications, the polynomial type

decreasing the computational complexity of using stochastic collocation (SC)
methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with random input data.
The SC approaches considered in this effort consist of sequentially constructed
multi-dimensional Lagrange interpolant in the random parametric domain,
formulated by collocating on a set of points so that the resulting
approximation is defined in a hierarchical sequence of polynomial spaces of
increasing fidelity. Our acceleration approach exploits the construction of the
SC interpolant to accelerate the underlying ensemble of deterministic
solutions. Specifically, we predict the solution of the parametrized PDE at
each collocation point on the current level of the SC approximation by
evaluating each sample with a previously assembled lower fidelity interpolant,
and then use such predictions to provide deterministic (linear or nonlinear)
iterative solvers with improved initial approximations. As a concrete example,
we develop our approach in the context of SC approaches that employ sparse
tensor products of globally defined Lagrange polynomials on nested
one-dimensional Clenshaw-Curtis abscissas. This work also provides a rigorous
computational complexity analysis of the resulting fully discrete sparse grid
SC approximation, with and without acceleration, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed methodology in reducing the total number of
iterations of a conjugate gradient solution of the finite element systems at
each collocation point. Numerical examples include both linear and nonlinear
parametrized PDEs, which are used to illustrate the theoretical results and the
improved efficiency of this technique compared with several others.

we really need millions of semantically-labeled images to train a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN)? In this paper, we present a simple yet surprisingly
powerful approach for unsupervised learning of CNN. Specifically, we use
hundreds of thousands of unlabeled videos from the web to learn visual
representations. Our key idea is that visual tracking provides the supervision.
That is, two patches connected by a track should have similar visual
representation in deep feature space since they probably belong to the same
object or object part. We design a Siamese-triplet network with a ranking loss
function to train this CNN representation. Without using a single image from
ImageNet, just using 100K unlabeled videos and the VOC 2012 dataset, we train
an ensemble of unsupervised networks that achieves 52% mAP (no bounding box
regression). This performance comes tantalizingly close to its
ImageNet-supervised counterpart, an ensemble which achieves a mAP of 54.4%. We
also show that our unsupervised network can perform competitively in other
tasks such as surface-normal estimation.

taking into account distribution of nucleons in the $\alpha$ decaying nuclear

into the model the calculated bremsstrahlung spectrum is changed very slowly
for a majority of the $\alpha$ decaying nuclei. However, we have observed that
visible changes really exist for the $^{106}{\rm Te}$ nucleus
($Q_{\alpha}=4.29$ MeV, $T_{1/2}$=70 mks) even for the energy of the emitted
photons up to 1 MeV. This nucleus is a good candidate for future experimental
study of this task. (2) Inclusion of the nucleon structure into the model
increases the bremsstrahlung probability of the emitted photons. (3) We find
the following tendencies for obtaining the nuclei, which have bremsstrahlung
spectra more sensitive to the nucleon structure: (a) direction to nuclei with
smaller $Z$, (b) direction to nuclei with larger $Q_{\alpha}$-values.

ocean-based flight vehicle measurement. Here we have analyzed four groups of
ship-rocking time series in horizontal and vertical directions utilizing a
Hilbert based method from statistical physics. Our method gives a way to
construct an analytic signal on the two-dimensional plane from a
one-dimensional time series. The analytic signal share the complete property of
the original time series. From the analytic signal of a time series, we have
found some information of the original time series which are often hidden from
the view of the conventional methods. The analytic signals of interest usually
evolve very smoothly on the complex plane. In addition, the phase of the
analytic signal is usually moves linearly in time. From the auto-correlation
and cross-correlation functions of the original signals as well as the
instantaneous amplitudes and phase increments of the analytic signals we have
found that the ship-rocking in horizontal direction drives the ship-rocking in
vertical direction when the ship navigates freely. And when the ship keeps a
fixed navigation direction such relation disappears. Based on these resultswe
could predict certain amount of future values of the ship-rocking time series
based on the current and the previous values. Our predictions are as accurate
as the conventional methods from stochastic processes and provide a much wider
prediction time range.

Deep Water Neutrino Observatory. The thick water layer is an excellent shield
against any local impacts on the detectors. The first annual series 2012/2013
has demonstrated that detector signals respond to the heliogeophysical
processes and causal connection of the signals directed downwards: from the
Earth surface to the Baikal floor. But this nonlocal connection proved to be in
reverse time. In addition advanced nonlocal correlation of the detector signal
with the regional source-process: the random component of hydrological activity
in the upper layer was revealed and the possibility of its forecast on nonlocal
correlations was demonstrated. But the strongest macroscopic nonlocal
correlations are observed at extremely low frequencies, that is at periods of
several months. Therefore the above results should be verified in a longer
experiment. We verify them by data of the second annual series 2013/2014 of the
Baikal experiment. All the results have been confirmed, although some
quantitative parameters of correlations and time reversal causal links turned
out different due to nonstationarity of the source-processes. A new result is
displaying of the advanced response of nonlocal correlation detector to the
