calculation of systematics in the electron's electric dipole moment search
experiment on ThO $H^3\Delta_1$ state related to geometric phases, including
dependence on $\Omega$-doublet, rotational level, and external static electric

activities, but their neural control and governing mechanics are relatively
unexplored. We consider neuromechanical systems where slow movements are
produced by neural commands that modulate muscle stiffness. This formulation
based on strain-energy equilibria is in agreement with prior work on neural
control of muscle and limb impedance. Slow limb movements are driftless in the
sense that movement stops when neural commands stop. We demonstrate, in the
context of two planar tendon-driven systems representing a finger and a leg,
that the control of muscle stiffness suffices to produce stable and accurate
limb postures and quasi-static (slow) transitions among them. We prove,
however, that stable postures are achievable only when muscles are
pre-tensioned, as is the case for natural muscle tone. Our results further
indicate, in accordance with experimental findings, that slow movements are
non-smooth. The non-smoothness arises because the precision with which
individual muscle stiffnesses need to be controlled changes substantially
throughout the limb's motion. These results underscore the fundamental roles of
muscle tone and accurate neural control of muscle stiffness in producing stable
limb postures and slow movements.

century in many different contexts ranging from nuclear matter to atomic

perturbations results in frictionless motion for superfluids and
resistance-free electric current in superconductors. This peculiar behaviour is
lost when external perturbations overcome a critical threshold, i.e. above a
critical magnetic field or a critical current for superconductors. In
superfluids, such as liquid helium or ultracold gases, the corresponding
quantities are critical rotation rate and critical velocity, respectively.
Enhancing the critical values is of great fundamental and practical value. Here
we demonstrate that superfluidity can be achieved for flow above the critical
velocity through quantum interference induced resonances. This has far reaching
consequences for the fundamental understanding of superfluidity and
superconductivity and opens up new application possibilities in quantum
metrology, e.g. in rotation sensing.

$\textit{Kepler}$ observations of AGN light curves offer a unique insight into
the variability properties of AGN light curves because of the very rapid
($11.6-28.6$ min) and highly uniform rest-frame sampling combined with a
photometric precision of $1$ part in $10^{5}$ over a period of 3.5 yr. We
categorize the light curves of all 20 objects based on visual similarities and
find that the light curves fall into 5 broad categories. We measure the first
order structure function of these light curves and model the observed light
curve with a general broken power-law PSD characterized by a short-timescale
power-law index $\gamma$ and turnover timescale $\tau$. We find that less than
half the objects are consistent with a DRW and observe variability on short
timescales ($\sim 2$ h). The turnover timescale $\tau$ ranges from $\sim
10-135$ d. Interesting structure function features include pronounced dips on
rest-frame timescales ranging from $10-100$ d and varying slopes on different
timescales. The range of observed short-timescale PSD slopes and the presence
of dip and varying slope features suggests that the DRW model may not be
appropriate for all AGN. We conclude that AGN variability is a complex
phenomenon that requires a more sophisticated statistical treatment.

every monotone cofinal map on an ultrafilter from a certain class of

These theorems are then applied to find connections between Tukey,
Rudin-Keisler, and Rudin-Blass reducibilities on large classes of ultrafilters.
  The main theorems on canonical cofinal maps are the following. Under a mild
assumption, basic Tukey reductions are inherited under Tukey reduction. In
particular, every ultrafilter Tukey reducible to a p-point has continuous Tukey
reductions. If $\mathcal{U}$ is a Fubini iterate of p-points, then each
monotone cofinal map from $\mathcal{U}$ to some other ultrafilter is generated
(on a cofinal subset of $\mathcal{U}$) by a finitary map on the base tree for
$\mathcal{U}$ which is monotone and end-extension preserving - the analogue of
continuous in this context. Further, every ultrafilter which is Tukey reducible

Interpolation Method DEIM projection operator. The interpolation node selection
procedure is formulated using the QR factorization with column pivoting, and it
enjoys a sharper error bound for the DEIM projection error. Furthermore, for a
subspace $\mathcal{U}$ given as the range of an orthonormal $U$, the DEIM
projection does not change if $U$ is replaced by $U \Omega$ with arbitrary
unitary matrix $\Omega$. In a large-scale setting, the new approach allows
modifications that use only randomly sampled rows of $U$, but with the
potential of producing good approximations with corresponding probabilistic
error bounds. Another salient feature of the new framework is that robust and
efficient software implementation is easily developed, based on readily
available high performance linear algebra packages.

We further observe that although the earlier model of Lu explains many of the
current observational findings of different probes it fails the desirable tests
of thermodynamical stability. We also note that for $n < 0$ our model points to
a phantom type of expansion which, however, is found to be compatible with
current SNe Ia observations and CMB anisotropy measurements. Further the third
law of thermodynamics is obeyed in our case. Our model is very general in the

the procedure of minimizing a divergence functional proposed by Koenker and
Mizera (2010) if and only if $Q$ admits full-dimensional support and a first
moment. We also show continuity of the divergence functional in $Q$: if $Q_n
\to Q$ in the Wasserstein metric, then the projected densities converge in
weighted $L_1$ metrics and uniformly on closed subsets of the continuity set of
the limit. Moreover, directional derivatives of the projected densities also
enjoy local uniform convergence. This contains both on-the-model and
off-the-model situations, and entails strong consistency of the divergence
estimator of an $s$-concave density under mild conditions. One interesting and
important feature for the R\'enyi divergence estimator of an $s$-concave
density is that the estimator is intrinsically related with the estimation of
log-concave densities via maximum likelihood methods. In fact, we show that for
$d=1$ at least, the R\'enyi divergence estimators for $s$-concave densities
converge to the maximum likelihood estimator of a log-concave density as $s
\nearrow 0$. The R\'enyi divergence estimator shares similar characterizations

images is a fundamental yet active research area in computer vision. Despite
the steady progress in multi-view stereo reconstruction, most existing methods
are still limited in recovering fine-scale details and sharp features while
suppressing noises, and may fail in reconstructing regions with few textures.
To address these limitations, this paper presents a Detail-preserving and
Content-aware Variational (DCV) multi-view stereo method, which reconstructs
the 3D surface by alternating between reprojection error minimization and mesh
denoising. In reprojection error minimization, we propose a novel inter-image
similarity measure, which is effective to preserve fine-scale details of the
reconstructed surface and builds a connection between guided image filtering
and image registration. In mesh denoising, we propose a content-aware
$\ell_{p}$-minimization algorithm by adaptively estimating the $p$ value and
regularization parameters based on the current input. It is much more promising
in suppressing noise while preserving sharp features than conventional
isotropic mesh smoothing. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our DCV method is capable of recovering more surface details,
and obtains cleaner and more accurate reconstructions than state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, our method achieves the best results among all
published methods on the Middlebury dino ring and dino sparse ring datasets in
terms of both completeness and accuracy.

model liquids with hard-sphere plus attractive (Yukawa or square well) pair
potential, the theory predicts that the spinodal curve, besides being the
threshold of the thermo- dynamic stability of homogeneous states, is also the
borderline between the regions of ergodic and non-ergodic homogeneous states.
It also predicts that the high-density liquid-glass transition line, whose
high-temperature limit corresponds to the well-known hard-sphere glass
transition, at lower temperature intersects the spinodal curve and continues
inside the spinodal region as a glass-glass transition line. Within the region
bounded from below by this low-temperature glass-glass tran- sition and from

with qualitatively different temperature dependence of various physical

  is significantly simplified and all results are presented parametrically",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the quality of outcomes in repeated games when the population of
players is dynamically changing and participants use learning algorithms to
adapt to the changing environment. Game theory classically considers Nash
equilibria of one-shot games, while in practice many games are played
repeatedly, and in such games players often use algorithmic tools to learn to
play in the given environment. Most previous work on learning in repeated games
assumes that the population playing the game is static over time.
  We analyze the efficiency of repeated games in dynamically changing
environments, motivated by application domains such as Internet ad-auctions and
packet routing. We prove that, in many classes of games, if players choose
their strategies in a way that guarantees low adaptive regret, then high social
welfare is ensured, even under very frequent changes. In fact, in large markets
learning players achieve asymptotically optimal social welfare despite high
turnover. Previous work has only showed that high welfare is guaranteed for
learning outcomes in static environments. Our work extends these results to
more realistic settings when participation is drastically evolving over time.

of users vanish even in the asymptotic regime in the number of BS antennas. To
counter this attack, we develop a defense strategy in which we use a secret key

from the adversary enables the users to achieve secure DoF, identical to the

the computational power necessary for the adversary to achieve a non-zero

computations are based on paraxial ray trace and exact corrections added for
certain surface types and Buchdahl aberration coefficients for complex modules.
The resultant chain of paraxial ray traces and corrections for all relevant

detector under all normal operating conditions with a high degree of certainty.
This will allow a semi-autonomous control using simple in-house, programming
modules. The scheme is simple enough to be implemented even in a spreadsheet or

agent can stop and plan without incurring costs for the time spent planning.
However, planning time is not free in most real-world settings. For example, an
autonomous drone is subject to nature's forces, like gravity, even while it
thinks, and must either pay a price for counteracting these forces to stay in
place, or grapple with the state change caused by acquiescing to them. Policy
optimization in these settings requires metareasoning---a process that trades
off the cost of planning and the potential policy improvement that can be
achieved. We formalize and analyze the metareasoning problem for Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). Our work subsumes previously studied special cases
of metareasoning and shows that in the general case, metareasoning is at most
polynomially harder than solving MDPs with any given algorithm that disregards
the cost of thinking. For reasons we discuss, optimal general metareasoning
turns out to be impractical, motivating approximations. We present approximate
metareasoning procedures which rely on special properties of the BRTDP planning
algorithm and explore the effectiveness of our methods on a variety of
problems.

time constraints, we implicitly assume there is a successful implementation of
the Vainshtein mechanism which guarantees that standard cosmological evolution
is largely unaffected. We find that viable bigravity models are subject to far
less stringent constraints than massive gravity, where there is only one set of
(massive) tensor modes. In principle sensitive to the effective graviton mass
at the time of recombination, we find that in our setup the primordial tensor
spectrum is more responsive to the dynamics of the massless tensor sector
rather than its massive counterpart. We further show there are intriguing
windows in the parameter space of the theory which could potentially induce

the ACE winds flow. The footpoints are then placed in the context of EIT
284~\AA\ images and photospheric magnetograms, allowing us to categorize the
sources into four groups: coronal holes (CHs), active regions (ARs), the quiet
Sun (QS), and ""Undefined"". This practice also enables us to establish the
response to solar activity of the fractions occupied by each kind of solar
winds, and of their speeds and O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios measured in situ. We
find that during the maximum phase, the majority of ACE winds originate from
ARs. During the declining phase, CHs and ARs are equally important contributors
to the ACE solar winds. The QS contribution increases with decreasing solar
activity, and maximizes in the minimum phase when QS appear to be the primary
supplier of the ACE winds. With decreasing activity, the winds from all sources
tend to become cooler, as represented by the increasingly low O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$
ratios. On the other hand, during each activity phase, the AR winds tend to be
the slowest and associated with the highest O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios, and the
CH winds correspond to the other extreme, with the QS winds lying in between.
Applying the same analysis method to the slow winds only, here defined as the
winds with speeds lower than 500 km s$^{-1}$, we find basically the same
overall behavior, as far as the contributions of individual groups of sources
are concerned. This statistical study indicates that QS regions are an
important source of the solar wind during the minimum phase.

jet, the jet maximum is located too far to the west when compared to
observation. Orography has minimal impact on the simulated TEJ hence indicating
that latent heating is the crucial parameter. A series of aqua-planet
experiments with increasing complexity was undertaken to understand the reasons
for the extreme westward shift of the TEJ.
  The aqua-planet simulations show that a single heat source in the deep
tropics is inadequate to explain the structure of the observed TEJ. Equatorial
heating is necessary to impart a baroclinic structure and a realistic
meridional structure. Jet zonal wind speeds are directly related to the
magnitude of deep tropical heating. The location of peak zonal wind is
influenced by off-equatorial heating which is closest to it. Hence the presence
of excess rainfall in Saudi Arabia has been shown to be the primary reason for
the extreme westward shift of the TEJ maximum.

the decreasing and the relative rearrangements.
  Independently of the image spatial dimension (one-dimensional signal, image,
volume of images, etc.), we reformulate these filters as integral operators
defined in a one-dimensional space corresponding to the level sets measures.
  We prove the equivalence between the usual pixel-based version and the
rearranged version of the filter. When restricted to the discrete setting, our
reformulation of bilateral filters extends previous results for the so-called
fast bilateral filtering. We, in addition, prove that the solution of the
discrete setting, understood as constant-wise interpolators, converges to the
solution of the continuous setting.
  Finally, we numerically illustrate computational aspects concerning quality
approximation and execution time provided by the rearranged formulation.

discovery of motifs is crucial for practitioners in order to understand and

  However, this paper proposes an entirely new perspective in finding motifs.
We demonstrate that searching is non-optimal since the domain of motifs is

find optimal motifs. We treat the occurrence frequency as a function and
time-series motifs as its parameters, therefore we \textit{learn} the optimal
motifs that maximize the frequency function. In contrast to searching, our
method is able to discover the most repetitive patterns (hence optimal), even
in cases where they do not explicitly occur as sub-sequences. Experiments on
several real-life time-series datasets show that the motifs found by our method
are highly more frequent than the ones found through searching, for exactly the

out that a performance degradation with respect to bulk is inevitable as the
nanostructure transitions to being multi moded. It is then shown that a nano
embedded system of suitable cross-section offers a power density advantage over
a wide range of efficiencies at higher packing fractions, and this range
gradually narrows down to the high efficiency regime, as the packing fraction

a significant bandgap has never been demonstrated. The reason is that,
regardless of the theoretical gap formation mechanism, disorder at the
sub-nanometer scale prevents the required chiral symmetry breaking necessary to
open a bandgap in graphene. In this work, we show for the first time that a 2D
semiconducting graphene film can be made by epitaxial growth. Using improved
growth methods, we show by direct band measurements that a bandgap greater than
0.5 eV can be produced in the first graphene layer grown on the SiC(0001)
surface. This work demonstrates that order, a property that remains lacking in
other graphene systems, is key to producing electronically viable
semiconducting graphene.

item of study at the intersection of economics and computer science. The notion
of the price of anarchy takes a worst-case stance to efficiency analysis,
considering instance independent guarantees of efficiency. We propose a
data-dependent analog of the price of anarchy that refines this worst-case
assuming access to samples of strategic behavior. We focus on auction settings,
where the latter is non-trivial due to the private information held by
participants. Our approach to bounding the efficiency from data is robust to
statistical errors and mis-specification. Unlike traditional econometrics,
which seek to learn the private information of players from observed behavior
and then analyze properties of the outcome, we directly quantify the
inefficiency without going through the private information. We apply our
approach to datasets from a sponsored search auction system and find empirical
results that are a significant improvement over bounds from worst-case
analysis.

function of galaxies in a spectroscopic redshift survey. From this comparison
we found that when the sampling is low (the average number of object per cell
is around unity) it is necessary to use a parametric method to model the galaxy
distribution. We used a set of mock catalogues of VIPERS, in order to verify if
we were able to reconstruct the cell-count probability distribution once the
observational strategy is applied. We find that in the simulated catalogues,
the probability distribution of galaxies is better represented by a Gamma
expansion than a Skewed Log-Normal. Finally, we correct the cell-count
probability distribution function from the angular selection effect of the
VIMOS instrument and study the redshift and absolute magnitude dependency of
the underlying galaxy density function in VIPERS from redshift $0.5$ to $1.1$.
We found very weak evolution of the probability density distribution function
and that it is well approximated, independently from the chosen tracers, by a
Gamma distribution.

researchers due to its many applications to various fields such as
neurobiology, e-commerce and completion of tasks. In particular, Scale Free
networks with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, are widely used in
research since they are ubiquitous in nature and other real systems. In this
paper we focus on the surface relaxation growth model in Scale Free networks
with $2.5< \lambda <3$, and study the scaling behavior of the fluctuations, in
the steady state, with the system size $N$. We find a novel behavior of the
fluctuations characterized by a crossover between two regimes at a value of
$N=N^*$ that depends on $\lambda$: a logarithmic regime, found in previous
research, and a constant regime. We propose a function that describes this
crossover, which is in very good agreement with the simulations. We also find
that, for a system size above $N^{*}$, the fluctuations decrease with
$\lambda$, which means that the synchronization of the system improves as
$\lambda$ increases. We explain this crossover analyzing the role of the
network's heterogeneity produced by the system size $N$ and the exponent of the
degree distribution.

Svetlichny. In our setup, the moving and laboratory frames used the (same) set
of measurement directions that maximally violate Svetlichny's inequality in the
laboratory frame. We also investigate the behavior of Mermin's and Collins'
inequalities. We find that, regardless of the particles' type of entanglement,
violation of Svetlichny's inequality in the moving frame is decreased by
increasing the boost velocity and the energy of particles in the laboratory
frame. In the relativistic regime Svetlichny's inequality is a good criterion
to investigate the non-locality of the GHZ state. We also find that Mermin's
and Collins' inequalities lead to reasonable predictions, in agreement with the
behavior of the spin state, about non-locality of the W state in the
relativistic regime. Then, comparing our results with those in which Czachor's
relativistic spin is used instead of the Pauli operator, we find that the
results obtained by considering the Pauli spin operator are in better agreement
with the behavior of spin state of the system in the relativistic information
theory.
