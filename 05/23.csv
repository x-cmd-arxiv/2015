BEVALAC energies are calculated using a coarse-grained time evolution from the
Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. The
coarse-graining of the microscopic simulations enables to calculate thermal
dilepton emission rates by application of in-medium spectral functions from
equilibrium quantum-field theoretical calculations. The results show that
extremely high baryon chemical potentials dominate the evolution of the created
hot and dense fireball. Consequently, a significant modification of the $\rho$
spectral shape becomes visible in the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum,
resulting in an enhancement in the low-mass region $M_{ee} = 200$ to 600
MeV/$c^{2}$. This enhancement, mainly caused by baryonic effects on the $\rho$
spectral shape, can fully describe the experimentally observed excess above the
hadronic cocktail contributions in Ar+KCl ($E_{\mathrm{lab}}=1.76$ $A$GeV)
reactions as measured by the HADES collaboration and also gives a good
explanation of the older DLS Ca+Ca ($E_{\mathrm{lab}}=1.04$ $A$GeV) data. For
the larger Au+Au ($E_{\mathrm{lab}}=1.23$ $A$GeV) system, we predict an even
stronger excess from our calculations. A systematic comparison of the results
for different system sizes from C+C to Au+Au shows that the thermal dilepton
yield increases stronger ($\propto A^{4/3}$) than the hadronic background
contributions, which scale with $A$, due to its sensitivity on the time
evolution of the reaction. We stress that the findings of the present work are
consistent with our previous coarse-graining results for the NA60 measurements
at top SPS energy. We argue that it is possible to describe the dilepton
results from SIS 18 up to SPS energies by considering the modifications of the
$\rho$ spectral function inside a hot and dense medium within the same model.

The magnetic-field dependence of microwave-induced corrections to phonon-drag

  The novel properties of the quantum Hall system raised an important question:
Can we have such important quantum properties in other systems? Especially, can
we find a quantum system without magnetic field but maintaining the same

left to age during a time $t_w$ before being submitted to a constant shear rate
$\dot \gamma$. We investigate in detail the effects of both $t_w$ and $\dot
\gamma$ on the fluidization dynamics and build a detailed state diagram of the
gel response to shear startup flows. The gel may either display transient shear
banding towards complete fluidization, or steady-state shear banding. In the
former case, we unravel that the progressive fluidization occurs by successive
steps that appear as peaks on the global stress relaxation signal. Flow imaging
reveals that the shear band grows up to complete fluidization of the material
by sudden avalanche-like events which are distributed heterogeneously along the
vorticity direction and correlated to large peaks in the slip velocity at the
moving wall. These features are robust over a wide range of values of $t_w$ and
$\dot \gamma$, although the very details of the fluidization scenario vary with
$\dot \gamma$. Finally, the critical shear rate $\dot \gamma^*$ that separates
steady-state shear-banding from steady-state homogeneous flow depends on the
width on the shear cell and exhibits a nonlinear dependence with $t_w$. Our
work brings about valuable experimental data on transient flows of attractive

uniqueness phase transition from statistical physics on the infinite
$\Delta$-regular tree. Our objective is to study the impact of this
classification on unweighted 2-spin models on $k$-uniform hypergraphs. As has
already been indicated by Yin and Zhao, the connection between the uniqueness
phase transition and the complexity of approximate counting breaks down in the
hypergraph setting. Nevertheless, we show that for every non-trivial symmetric
$k$-ary Boolean function $f$ there exists a degree bound $\Delta_0$ so that for
all $\Delta \geq \Delta_0$ the following problem is NP-hard: given a
$k$-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$, approximate the
partition function of the hypergraph 2-spin model associated with $f$. It is
NP-hard to approximate this partition function even within an exponential
factor. By contrast, if $f$ is a trivial symmetric Boolean function (e.g., any
function $f$ that is excluded from our result), then the partition function of
the corresponding hypergraph 2-spin model can be computed exactly in polynomial

multiple large circular portions of the Fermi surface with a very good

consists of two singular constructs formed by the edges of several bands,
pulled to the Fermi level from the depths of the theoretically predicted band
structure by strong electronic interactions. Such singularities dramatically
affect the low-energy electronic properties of the material, including
superconductivity. We further argue that occurrence of these singularities
correlates with the maximum superconducting transition temperature attainable

could be realized within other universes, this paper delineates the galactic
parameters that allow for habitable planets and revisits constraints on the
amplitude $Q$ of the primordial density fluctuations. Previous work indicates
that large values of $Q$ lead to galaxies so dense that planetary orbits cannot
survive long enough for life to develop. Small values of $Q$ lead to delayed
star formation, loosely bound galaxies, and compromised heavy element
retention. This work generalizes previous treatments: [A] We consider models
for the internal structure of galaxies and find the fraction of galactic real
estate that allows stable, long-lived planetary orbits. [B] We perform a large
ensemble of numerical simulations to estimate cross sections for the disruption
of planetary orbits due to interactions with passing stars. [C] We consider
disruption due to the background radiation fields produced by the galaxies. [D]
One consequence of intense galactic background radiation fields is that some
portion of the galaxy, denoted as the Galactic Habitable Zone, will provide the
right flux levels to support habitable planets for essentially any planetary
orbit. As $Q$ increases, the fraction of stars in a galaxy that allow for
habitable planets decreases due to both orbital disruption and the intense
background radiation. However, the outer parts of the galaxy always allow for
habitable planets, so that the value of $Q$ does not have a well-defined upper
limit. Moreover, some Galactic Habitable Zones are large enough to support more
potentially habitable planets than the galaxies found in our universe. These
results suggest that the possibilities for habitability in other universes are
somewhat more favorable and far more diverse than previously imagined.

symmetric with a large angular extent ($\approx$ 8 degrees). However, whether
the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the cloud is shell- or ring-like has
not yet been fully resolved. We study the 3D structure using a new approach
that combines a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model for ultraviolet (UV)
scattered light and an inverse Abel transform, which gives a detailed 3D radial
density profile from a two-dimensional column density map of a spherically
symmetric cloud. By comparing the radiative transfer models for a spherical
shell cloud and that for a ring cloud, we find that only the shell model can
reproduce the radial profile of the scattered UV light, observed using the
S2/68 UV observation, suggesting a dust shell structure. However, the inverse
Abel transform applied to the column density data from the Pan-STARRS1 dust
reddening map results in negative values at a certain radius range of the
density profile, indicating the existence of additional, non-spherical clouds
near the nebular boundary. The additional cloud component is assumed to be of
toroidal ring shape; we subtracted from the column density to obtain a
positive, radial density profile using the inverse Abel transform. The
resulting density structure, composed of a toroidal ring and a spherical shell,
is also found to give a good fit to the UV scattered light profile. We
therefore conclude that the cloud around $\lambda$ Ori is composed of both ring
and shell structures.

are modelled in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs) of
Hamilton-Jacobi type. To improve the robustness of such methods w.r.t. noise
and missing data, first approaches have recently been proposed that seek to
embed the underlying PDE into a variational framework with data and smoothness
term. So far, however, such methods either make use of a radial depth
parametrisation that makes the regularisation hard to interpret from a
geometrical viewpoint or they consider indirect smoothness terms that require
additional consistency constraints to provide valid solutions. Moreover the
minimisation of such frameworks is an intricate task, since the underlying
energy is typically non-convex. In our paper we address all three of the
aforementioned issues. First, we propose a novel variational model that
operates directly on the Cartesian depth. In this context, we also point out a
common mistake in the derivation of the surface normal. Moreover, we employ a
direct second-order regulariser with edge-preservation property. This direct
regulariser yields by construction valid solutions without requiring additional
consistency constraints. Finally, we also propose a novel coarse-to-fine
minimisation framework based on an alternating explicit scheme. This framework
allows us to avoid local minima during the minimisation and thus to improve the
accuracy of the reconstruction. Experiments show the good quality of our model
as well as the usefulness of the proposed numerical scheme.

important problems in fluid dynamics: Kolmogorov flow and Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection. For each image we compute a persistence diagram to yield a reduced
description of the flow field; by applying different metrics to the space of
persistence diagrams, we relate characteristic features in persistence diagrams
to the geometry of the corresponding flow patterns. We also examine the
dynamics of the flow patterns by a second application of persistent homology to
the time series of persistence diagrams. We demonstrate that persistent
homology provides an effective method both for quotienting out symmetries in
families of solutions and for identifying multiscale recurrent dynamics. Our
approach is quite general and it is anticipated to be applicable to a broad
range of open problems exhibiting complex spatio-temporal behavior.

superconductivity emerges only from an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic stripe
phase, which can in principle be described in terms of either localized or
itinerant spins. However, we recently reported that tetragonal symmetry is
restored inside the magnetically ordered state of a hole-doped BaFe2As2. This
observation was interpreted as indirect evidence of a new double-Q magnetic
structure, but alternative models of orbital order could not be ruled out.
Here, we present Mossbauer data that show unambiguously that half of the iron
sites in this tetragonal phase are non-magnetic, establishing conclusively the
existence of a novel magnetic ground state with a non-uniform magnetization
that is inconsistent with localized spins. We show that this state is naturally
explained as the interference between two spin-density waves, demonstrating the
itinerant character of the magnetism of these materials and the primary role
played by magnetic over orbital degrees of freedom.

utilized to help monitor and adapt to extreme events, including urban
heatwaves. Typical approaches to the monitoring of climate data include weather
station monitoring and remote sensing. However, climate monitoring stations are
very often distributed spatially in a sparse manner, and consequently, this has
a significant impact on the ability to reveal exposure risks due to extreme
climates at an intra-urban scale. Additionally, traditional remote sensing data
sources are typically not received and analyzed in real-time which is often
required for adaptive urban management of climate extremes, such as sudden
heatwaves. Fortunately, recent social media, such as Twitter, furnishes
real-time and high-resolution spatial information that might be useful for
climate condition estimation. The objective of this study is utilizing
geo-tagged tweets (participatory sensing data) for urban temperature analysis.
We first detect tweets relating hotness (hot-tweets). Then, we study
relationships between monitored temperatures and hot-tweets via a statistical
model framework based on copula modelling methods. We demonstrate that there
are strong relationships between ""hot-tweets"" and temperatures recorded at an
intra-urban scale. Subsequently, we then investigate the application of
""hot-tweets"" informing spatio-temporal Gaussian process interpolation of
temperatures as an application example of ""hot-tweets"". We utilize a
combination of spatially sparse weather monitoring sensor data and spatially
and temporally dense lower quality twitter data. Here, a spatial best linear
unbiased estimation technique is applied. The result suggests that tweets
provide some useful auxiliary information for urban climate assessment. Lastly,
effectiveness of tweets toward a real-time urban risk management is discussed
based on the results.

5-dim conformally flat empty bulk with a timelike extra dimension. Einstein's
equations on the brane reduces to a 6-dim Hamiltonian dynamical system with
additional terms that implement nonsingular bounces in the model. The phase
space of the model has two critical points (a saddle-center-center and a
center-center-center) in a finite region of phase space, and two asymptotic de
Sitter critical points, one acting as an attractor to late-time dynamics. The
saddle-center-center engenders in the phase space the topology of stable and
unstable 4-dim cylinders $R \times S^3$, where $R$ is a saddle direction and
$S^3$ is the center manifold of unstable periodic orbits (the nonlinear
extension of the center-center sector). By a proper canonical transformation we
separate the degrees of freedom of the dynamics into one degree connected with
the expansion/contraction of the scales of the model, and two rotational
degrees of freedom connected to the $S^3$. The typical dynamical flow is then
an oscillatory mode about a neighborhood of the cylinders. For the stable and
unstable cylinders the oscillatory motion about the separatrix towards the
bounce leads to the homoclinic transversal intersection of the cylinders, as
shown numerically in two distinct experiments. We show that the homoclinic

uses a novel implementation of gas cooling in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics

as their emission spectrum is too hard to effectively couple with galactic gas.
In contrast, X-rays from the ICM couple well with gas in the temperature range
$10^4 - 10^6$ K. Idealised simulations show that the hot halo radiation field
has minimal impact on the dynamics of cooling flows in clusters because of the
high virial temperature ($> 10^7$K), making the interaction between the gas and
incident photons very ineffective. Satellite galaxies in cluster environments,
on the other hand, experience a high radiation flux due to the emission from
the host halo. Low mass satellites ($< 10^{12}\rm{M_\odot}$) in particular have
virial temperatures that are exactly in the regime where the effect of the
radiation field is maximal. Idealised simulations of satellite galaxies
including only the effect of host halo radiation (no ram pressure stripping or
tidal effects) fields show a drastic reduction in the amount of cool gas formed
($\sim 40\%$) on a short timescale of about $0.5$ Gyrs. A galaxy merger
simulation including all the other environmental quenching mechanisms, shows
about $20\%$ reduction in the stellar mass of the satellite and about $\sim
30\%$ reduction in star formation rate after $1$ Gyr due to the host hot halo
radiation field. These results indicate that the hot halo radiation fields
potentially play an important role in quenching galaxies in cluster

thought to sink to the center of the potential and form a supermassive black
hole binary; this binary can eject stars via 3-body scattering, bringing the
SMBHs ever closer. In a static spherical galaxy model, the binary stalls at a
separation of about a parsec after ejecting all the stars in its loss cone --
this is the well-known final parsec problem. However it has been shown that
SMBH binaries in non-spherical galactic nuclei harden at a nearly constant rate
until reaching the gravitational wave regime. Here we use a suite of direct
N-body simulations to follow SMBH binary evolution in both corotating and
counterrotating flattened galaxy models. For N larger than 500K, we find that
the evolution of the SMBH binary is convergent, and is independent of the
particle number. Rotation in general increases the hardening rate of SMBH
binaries even more effectively than galaxy geometry alone. SMBH binary
hardening rates are similar for co- and counterrotating galaxies. In the
corotating case, the center of mass of SMBH binary settles into an orbit that
is in a corotation resonance with the background rotating model, and the
coalescence time is roughly few hundred Myr faster than a non-rotating
flattened model. We find that counterrotation drives SMBHs to coalesce on a
nearly radial orbit promptly after forming a hard binary. We discuss the
implications for gravitational wave astronomy, hypervelocity star production,
and the effect on the structure of the host galaxy.

these shifts occur in any of our theories whose four-dimensional N=2

We then use our R symmetry map to find the four-dimensional ancestors of

the interaction with a circumbinary disk may efficiently drive the system to
sub-parsec separations, allowing the binary to enter a regime where the
emission of gravitational waves can drive it to merger within a Hubble time.
However, these interactions can also affect the orbital parameters of the
binary. In particular, they may drive an increase in binary eccentricity which
survives until the system's gravitational-wave signal enters the pulsar-timing
array band. Therefore, if we can measure the eccentricity from observed
signals, we can potentially deduce some of the properties of the binary
environment. To this end, we build on previous techniques to present a general
Bayesian pipeline with which we can detect and estimate the parameters of an
eccentric supermassive black-hole binary system with pulsar-timing arrays.
Additionally, we generalize the pulsar-timing array $\mathcal{F}_e$-statistic
to eccentric systems, and show that both this statistic and the Bayesian
pipeline are robust when studying circular or arbitrarily eccentric systems. We
explore how eccentricity influences the detection prospects of single
gravitational-wave sources, as well as the detection penalty incurred by
employing a circular waveform template to search for eccentric signals, and
conclude by identifying important avenues for future study.

luminous systems bound by dark matter halos (<10^5 Lsun) -- may have formed
before reionization. The extrapolated virial masses today are uncertain with
estimates ranging from 10^8 Msun to 10^9 Msun. We show that the progenitor halo
masses of UFDs can be as low as Mvir = 10^7 Msun. Under the right conditions,
such a halo can survive the energy input of a supernova and its radiative
progenitor. A clumpy medium is much less susceptible to both internal and
external injections of energy. It is less prone to SN sweeping because the
coupling efficiency of the explosive energy is much lower than for a diffuse
ISM. With the aid of the 3D hydro/ionization code Fyris, we show that
sufficient baryons are retained to form stars following a single supernova
event in dark matter halos down to Mvir ~ 10^7 Msun with radiative cooling. The
gas survives the SN explosion, is enriched with the abundance yields of the
discrete events, and reaches surface densities where low mass stars can form.
Our highest resolution simulations reveal why cooling is so effective in
retaining gas compared to any other factor. In the early stages, the super-hot
metal-enriched SN ejecta exhibit strong cooling, leading to much of the
explosive energy being lost. Consistent with earlier work, the baryons do *not*
survive in smooth or adiabatic models in the event of a supernova. The smallest
galaxies carry signatures of the earliest epochs of star formation, which may
distinguish a small primordial galaxy from one that was stripped down to its
present size through tidal interaction. We discuss these results in the context
of local UFDs and damped Ly-alpha systems (z~2) at very low metallicity ([Fe/H]
~ -3). We show that both classes of objects are consistent with primordial
low-mass systems that have experienced only a few enrichment events.

Lyman-limit absorption systems (LLSs) with low heavy-element abundances similar
to those of the diffuse IGM. Here we report on an abundance survey of 17 H
I-selected LLSs at $z=3.2$-4.4 which exhibit no metal absorption in SDSS
spectra. Using medium-resolution spectra obtained at Magellan, we derive
ionization-corrected metallicities (or limits) with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
sampling that accounts for the large uncertainty in $N_{\rm HI}$ measurements
typical of LLSs. The metal-poor LLS sample overlaps with the IGM in metallicity
and is best described by a model where $71^{+13}_{-11}\%$ are drawn from the
IGM chemical abundance distribution. These represent roughly half of all LLSs
at these redshifts, suggesting that 28-40$\%$ of the general LLS population at
$z\sim3.7$ could trace unprocessed gas. An ancillary sample of ten LLSs without
any a priori metal-line selection is best fit with $48^{+14}_{-12}\%$ of
metallicities drawn from the IGM. We compare these results with regions of a
moving-mesh simulation; the simulation finds only half as many baryons in
IGM-metallicity LLSs, and most of these lie beyond the virial radius of the
nearest galaxy halo. A statistically significant fraction of all LLSs have low
metallicity and therefore represent candidates for accreting gas; large-volume
simulations can establish what fraction of these candidates actually lie near
galaxies and the observational prospects for detecting the presumed hosts in
emission.

analysis, we find that HFF14Tom is 0.77 +- 0.15 magnitudes brighter than
unlensed Type Ia SNe at similar redshift, implying a lensing magnification of
mu_obs = 2.03 +- 0.29. This observed magnification provides a rare opportunity
for a direct empirical test of galaxy cluster lens models. Here we test 17 lens
models, 13 of which were generated before the SN magnification was known,
qualifying as pure ""blind tests"". The models are collectively fairly accurate:
8 of the models deliver median magnifications that are consistent with the
measured mu to within 1-sigma. However, there is a subtle systematic bias: the
significant disagreements all involve models overpredicting the magnification.
We evaluate possible causes for this mild bias, and find no single physical or
methodological explanation to account for it. We do find that model accuracy
can be improved to some extent with stringent quality cuts on multiply-imaged
systems, such as requiring that a large fraction have spectroscopic redshifts.
In addition to testing model accuracies as we have done here, Type Ia SN
magnifications could also be used as inputs for future lens models of Abell
2744 and other clusters, providing valuable constraints in regions where
traditional strong- and weak-lensing information is unavailable.

effective dust temperature from Herschel data that were calibrated against
Planck. After calibration, we then fit a modified blackbody to the
long-wavelength Herschel data, using the Planck-derived dust opacity spectral
index beta, derived on scales of 30' (or ~1 pc). We use this model to make
predictions of the submillimeter flux density at 850 micron, and we compare
these in turn with APEX-Laboca observations. Results: A comparison of the
submillimeter dust optical depth and near-infrared extinction data reveals
evidence for an increased submillimeter dust opacity at high column densities,
interpreted as an indication of grain growth in the inner parts of the core.
Additionally, a comparison of the Herschel dust model and the Laboca data
reveals that the frequency dependence of the submillimeter opacity, described
by the spectral index beta, does not change. A single beta that is only
slightly different from the Planck-derived value is sufficient to describe the
data, beta=1.53+/-0.07. We apply a similar analysis to Barnard 68, a core with
significantly lower column densities than FeSt 1-457, and we do not find
evidence for grain growth but also a single beta. Conclusions: While we find
evidence for grain growth from the dust opacity in FeSt 1-457, we find no
evidence for significant variations in the dust opacity spectral index beta on
scales 0.02<x<1 pc (or 36""<x<30'). The correction to the Planck-derived dust
beta that we find in both cases is on the order of the measurement error, not
including any systematic errors, and it would thus be reasonable to directly
apply the dust beta from the Planck all-sky dust model. As a corollary,
reliable effective temperature maps can be derived which would be otherwise
affected by beta variations.

produces synthetic distributions for the oxygen abundance in up to 15

their median values and their 68% confidence regions. We test our code on
emission line measurements from a sample of nearby supernova host galaxies (z <

metallicity estimates are consistent with previous methods but yield smaller
statistical uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are not taken into account.

a model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound on
the size of any dispersive plasma cloud. The non-monotonic dependence of burst
widths (after deconvolution of instrumental effects) on dispersion measure
excludes the intergalactic medium as the location of scattering that broadens
the FRB in time. Temporal broadening far greater than that of pulsars at
similar high Galactic latitudes implies that scattering occurs close to the
sources, where high densities and strong turbulence are plausible. FRB
energetics are consistent with supergiant pulses from young, fast, high-field
pulsars at cosmological distances. The distribution of FRB dispersion measures
is inconsistent with expanding clouds (such as SNR). It excludes space-limited

dispersion map, previously hinted by SAURON observations. The structure is
reminiscent of velocity dispersion maps of galaxies comprising two
counter-rotating discs, and may explain the existence of the kinematically
distinct core (KDC). Further evidence for two counter-rotating components comes
from the analysis of the higher moments of the stellar line-of-sight velocity
distributions and fitting MUSE spectra with two separate Gaussian line-of-sight
velocity distributions. The emission-line kinematics show evidence of being
linked to the present cooling flows and the buoyant cavities seen in X-rays. We
detect ionised gas in a nuclear disc-like structure, oriented like the KDC,
which is, however, not directly related to the KDC. We build an axisymmetric
Schwarzschild dynamical model, which shows that the MUSE kinematics can be
reproduced well with two counter-rotating orbit families, characterised by
relatively low angular momentum components, but clearly separated in integral
phase space and with radially varying contributions. The model indicates that
the counter-rotating components in NGC5813 are not thin discs, but dynamically
hot structures. Our findings give further evidence that KDCs in massive
galaxies should not necessarily be considered as structurally or dynamically
decoupled regions, but as the outcomes of the mixing of different orbital
families, where the balance in the distribution of mass of the orbital families
is crucial. We discuss the formation of the KDC in NGC5813 within the framework
of gas accretion, binary mergers and formation of turbulent thick discs from
cold streams at high redshift.

prevent the vortex decay by applying a Gaussian potential with its width

created a stability diagram of height versus interaction strength which has

model of spin disorder parameterized to reproduce the experimental
magnetization, the temperature dependence of the average resistivity, the
anisotropic magnetoresistance and the spin polarization of a Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$

problem for a vegetation and soil water reaction diffusion system, with
rainfall as the main external parameter. By Pontryagin's maximum principle we
derive the associated four component canonical system, and numerically analyze
this and hence the optimal control problem in two steps. First we numerically
compute a rather rich bifurcation structure of flat (spatially homogeneous) and
patterned canonical steady states (FCSS and PCSS, respectively), in 1D and 2D.
Then we compute time dependent solutions of the canonical system that connect
to some FCSS or PCSS. The method is efficient in dealing with non-unique
canonical steady states, and thus also with multiple local maxima of the
objective function. It turns out that over wide parameter regimes the FCSS,
i.e., spatially uniform harvesting, are not optimal. Instead, controlling the
system to a PCSS yields a higher profit. Moreover, compared to (a simple model
of) private optimization, the social control gives a higher yield, and
vegetation survives for much lower rainfall. In addition, the computation of
the optimal (social) control gives an optimal tax to incorporate into the
private optimization.

segmentation in abdominal CT scans that is based on a hierarchy of information
propagation by classifying image patches at different resolutions; and
cascading superpixels. There are four stages: 1) decomposing CT slice images as
a set of disjoint boundary-preserving superpixels; 2) computing pancreas class
probability maps via dense patch labeling; 3) classifying superpixels by
pooling both intensity and probability features to form empirical statistics in
cascaded random forest frameworks; and 4) simple connectivity based
post-processing. The dense image patch labeling are conducted by: efficient
random forest classifier on image histogram, location and texture features; and
more expensive (but with better specificity) deep convolutional neural network
classification on larger image windows (with more spatial contexts). Evaluation
of the approach is performed on a database of 80 manually segmented CT volumes

item from a database without revealing any information about the identity of
the item being retrieved. Specifically, in information-theoretic $k$-server
PIR, the database is replicated among $k$ non-communicating servers, and each
server learns nothing about the item retrieved by the user. The cost of PIR
protocols is usually measured in terms of their communication complexity, which
is the total number of bits exchanged between the user and the servers, and
storage overhead, which is the ratio between the total number of bits stored on
all the servers and the number of bits in the database. Since single-server
information-theoretic PIR is impossible, the storage overhead of all existing
PIR protocols is at least $2$.
  In this work, we show that information-theoretic PIR can be achieved with
storage overhead arbitrarily close to the optimal value of $1$, without
sacrificing the communication complexity. Specifically, we prove that all known
$k$-server PIR protocols can be efficiently emulated, while preserving both
privacy and communication complexity but significantly reducing the storage
overhead. To this end, we distribute the $n$ bits of the database among $s+r$
servers, each storing $n/s$ coded bits (rather than replicas). For every fixed
$k$, the resulting storage overhead $(s+r)/s$ approaches $1$ as $s$ grows;
explicitly we have $r\le k\sqrt{s}(1+o(1))$. Moreover, in the special case $k =
2$, the storage overhead is only $1 + \frac{1}{s}$. In order to achieve these
results, we introduce and study a new kind of binary linear codes, called here
$k$-server PIR codes. We then show how such codes can be constructed, and we
establish several bounds on the parameters of $k$-server PIR codes. Finally, we
briefly discuss extensions of our results to nonbinary alphabets, to robust
PIR, and to $t$-private PIR.

second criterion, but it is a long-standing question whether it can be made to
fulfill the first. Previous attempts to experimentally test noncontextuality
have all presumed certain idealizations that do not hold in real experiments,

power control schemes to reduce an SBSs' energy consumption and thus ensure
quality-of-service (QoS) for users. Such energy-efficient design can also be
done via the use of content caching which reduces the usage of the
capacity-limited SBS backhaul. of popular content at SBS can also prove
beneficial in this regard by reducing the backhaul usage. In this paper, an
online energy efficient power control scheme is developed for an energy
harvesting SBS equipped with a wireless backhaul and local storage. In our
model, energy arrivals are assumed to be Poisson distributed and the popularity
distribution of requested content is modeled using Zipf's law. The power
control problem is formulated as a (discounted) infinite horizon dynamic
programming problem and solved numerically using the value iteration algorithm.
Using simulations, we provide valuable insights on the impact of energy
harvesting and caching on the energy and sum-throughput performance of the SBS

research. It is challenging to generate these standards because of the high
cost of expert time and the difficulty in establishing agreement between
annotators. We implemented and evaluated a microtask crowdsourcing approach
that can produce a gold standard for extracting drug-disease relations. The
aggregated crowd judgment agreed with expert annotations from a pre-existing
corpus on 43 of 60 sentences tested. The levels of crowd agreement varied in a
similar manner to the levels of agreement among the original expert annotators.
This work rein-forces the power of crowdsourcing in the process of assembling
gold standards for relation extraction. Further, it high-lights the importance
of exposing the levels of agreement between human annotators, expert or crowd,

spatially extended neural fields near a saddle-node bifurcation. The integral
terms of these evolution equations have a weight kernel describing synaptic
interactions between neurons at different locations of the network. Excited
regions of the neural field correspond to parts of the domain whose fraction of
active neurons exceeds a sharp threshold of a firing rate nonlinearity. For
sufficiently low firing threshold, a stable bump coexists with an unstable bump
and a homogeneous quiescent state. As the threshold is increased, the stable
and unstable branch of bump solutions annihilate in a saddle node bifurcation.
Near this criticality, we derive a quadratic amplitude equation that describes
the slow evolution of the even mode (bump contractions) as it depends on the
distance from the bifurcation. Beyond the bifurcation, bumps eventually become
extinct, and the time it takes for this to occur increases for systems nearer
the bifurcation. When noise is incorporated, a stochastic amplitude equation
for the even mode can be derived, which can be analyzed to reveal bump
extinction time both below and above the saddle-node.

to overcome limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One of the
fundamental tenets of CCN is that data, or content, is a named and addressable
entity in the network. Consumers request content by issuing interest messages
with the desired content name. These interests are forwarded by routers to
producers, and the resulting content object is returned and optionally cached
at each router along the path. In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce
access control policies on sensitive content outside of the producer since
routers only use interest information for forwarding decisions. To that end, we
propose an Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) scheme that enables access
control enforcement using only information contained in interest messages,
i.e., by making sensitive content names unpredictable to unauthorized parties.
Our IBAC scheme supports both hash- and encryption-based name obfuscation. We
address the problem of interest replay attacks by formulating a mutual trust
framework between producers and consumers that enables routers to perform
authorization checks when satisfying interests from their cache. We assess the
computational, storage, and bandwidth overhead of each IBAC variant. Our design
is flexible and allows producers to arbitrarily specify and enforce any type of
access control on content, without having to deal with the problems of content
encryption and key distribution. This is the first comprehensive design for CCN
access control using only information contained in interest messages.

several applications in DNA computing. A direct link between the elements of

discoveries of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in these systems demonstrate that our
knowledge is not as complete as usually assumed. Therefore, we undertook a
multi-year survey for WRs in the Magellanic Clouds. Our results from our first
year (reported previously) confirmed nine new LMC WRs. Of these, six were of a
type never before recognized, with WN3-type emission combined with O3-type
absorption features. Yet these stars are 2-3 magnitudes too faint to be WN3+O3
V binaries. Here we report on the second year of our survey, including the
discovery of four more WRs, two of which are also WN3/O3s, plus two ""slash""
WRs. This brings the total of LMC WRs known to 152, 13 (8.2%) of which were
found by our survey, which is now 60% complete. We find that the spatial
distribution of the WN3/O3s are similar to that of other WRs in the LMC,
suggesting that they are descended from the same progenitors. We call attention
to the fact that five of the 12 known SMC WRs may in fact be similar WN3/O3s
rather than the binaries they have often assumed to be. We also discuss our
other discoveries: a newly found Onfp-type star, and a peculiar emission-line
object. Finally, we consider the completeness limits of our survey.

model where each coefficient is associated independently with a unique
hyperparameter, the pattern-coupled prior for each coefficient not only
involves its own hyperparameter, but also its immediate neighboring

related to each other and the hierarchical model has the potential to encourage
2-D structured-sparse solutions. An expectation-maximization (EM) strategy is
employed to obtain the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the
hyperparameters, along with the posterior distribution of the sparse signal. In
addition, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is

clusters. These clusters require an enormous amount of power (~500-2000 kW
each), and most of this energy is converted into heat. Thus, cooling the
components of the supercomputer becomes a critical and expensive endeavor.
Recently a project was initiated to optimize the cooling system used to cool
one of the rooms housing three of these large clusters and develop a general
good-practice procedure for reducing cooling costs and monitoring other machine
rooms. This work focuses on the statistical approach used to quantify the
effect that several cooling changes to the room had on the temperatures of the
individual nodes of the computers. The largest cluster in the room has 1600
nodes that run a variety of jobs during general use. Since extremes
temperatures are important, a Normal distribution plus generalized Pareto
distribution for the upper tail is used to model the marginal distribution,
along with a Gaussian process copula to account for spatio-temporal dependence.
A Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model is used to model the spatial and/or
temporal effects on the node temperatures as the cooling changes take place.
This model is then used to assess the condition of the node temperatures after
each change to the room. The analysis approach was used to uncover the cause of
a problematic episode of overheating nodes on one of the supercomputing
clusters. The next step is to also use the model to estimate the trend in node
temperatures due to an increase in supply air temperature and ultimately decide
when any further temperature increases would become unsafe. This same process
can be applied to reduce the cooling expenses for other data centers as well.

antiferromagnetic model (with easy-plane anisotropy) on the kagome lattice. A
class of Gutzwiller projected fermionic states with a spin Jastrow factor is
considered to describe either spin liquids (with $U(1)$ or $Z_2$ symmetry) or
magnetically ordered phases (with ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ or ${\bf q}=(4\pi/3,0)$). We
find that the magnetic states are not stable in the thermodynamic limit.
Moreover, there is no energy gain to break the gauge symmetry from $U(1)$ to
$Z_2$ within the spin-liquid states, as previously found in the Heisenberg
model. The best variational wave function is therefore the $U(1)$ Dirac state,
supplemented by the spin Jastrow factor. Furthermore, a vanishing $S=2$ spin
gap is obtained at the variational level, in the whole regime from the $XY$ to
the Heisenberg model.

independently rotating cylinders and the transition to rotating plane Couette
flow (RPCF) in the limit of infinite radii. By using the shear Reynolds number
$Re_S$ and rotation number $R_\Omega$ as dimensionless parameters, the
transition from TCF to RPCF can be studied continuously without singularities.
Already for radius ratios $\eta\geq0.9$ we find that the simulation results for
various radius ratios and for RPCF collapse as a function of $R_\Omega$,
indicating a turbulent behaviour common to both systems. We observe this
agreement in the torque, mean momentum transport, mean profiles, and turbulent
fluctuations. Moreover, the central profiles in TCF and RPCF for $R_\Omega>0$
are found to conform with inviscid neutral stability. Intermittent bursts that
have been observed in the outer boundary layer and have been linked to the
formation of a torque maximum for counter-rotation are shown to disappear as
$\eta \rightarrow 1$. The corresponding torque maximum disappears as well.
Instead, two new maxima of different origin appear for $\eta\geq0.9$ and RPCF,
a broad and a narrow one, in contrast to the results for smaller $\eta$. The
broad maximum at $R_\Omega=0.2$ is connected with a strong vortical flow and
can be reproduced by streamwise invariant simulations. The narrow maximum at
$R_\Omega=0.02$ only emerges with increasing $Re_S$ and is accompanied by an
efficient and correlated momentum transport by the mean flow. Since the narrow
maximum is of larger amplitude for $Re_S=2\cdot10^4$, our simulations suggest
that it will dominate at even higher $Re_S$.

literature by presuming that a decision-maker may include its own-state
distribution in its decision. This leads to the class of mean-field-type games.
In mean-field-type situations, a single decision-maker may have a big impact on
the mean-field terms for which new type of optimality equations are derived. We
establish a finite dimensional stochastic maximum principle for mean-field-type
games where the drift functions have a p-norm structure which weaken the
classical Lipschitz and differentiability assumptions. Sufficient optimality
equations are established via Dynamic Programming Principle but in infinite
dimension. Using de Finetti-Hewitt-Savage theorem, we show that a propagation
of chaos property with 'virtual' particles holds for the non-linear

power grids. Stable power supply requires a robust design of the power grid
topology. Currently, the impact of the grid structure on the grid robustness is
mainly assessed by purely topological metrics, that fail to capture the
fundamental properties of the electrical power grids such as power flow
allocation according to Kirchhoff's laws. This paper deploys the effective
graph resistance as a metric to relate the topology of a grid to its robustness
against cascading failures. Specifically, the effective graph resistance is
deployed as a metric for network expansions (by means of transmission line
additions) of an existing power grid. Four strategies based on network
properties are investigated to optimize the effective graph resistance,
accordingly to improve the robustness, of a given power grid at a low
computational complexity. Experimental results suggest the existence of
Braess's paradox in power grids: bringing an additional line into the system
occasionally results in decrease of the grid robustness. This paper further
investigates the impact of the topology on the Braess's paradox, and identifies
specific sub-structures whose existence results in Braess's paradox. Careful
assessment of the design and expansion choices of grid topologies incorporating
the insights provided by this paper optimizes the robustness of a power grid,

is used to reject background. The detector was read out using two different
electronic chains connected to it by a few meters of cable. The first chain was
based on conventional charge-sensitive amplifiers, the other used a custom fast
charge amplifier developed for this purpose. The prototype has been tested at
various neutron sources and showed its practicability. In particular, the
detector was calibrated in a TRIGA thermal reactor (LENA laboratory, University
of Pavia) with neutron fluxes of $10^8$ n/cm$^2$s and at the 3 MeV D-D
monochromatic neutron source named FNG (ENEA, Rome) with neutron fluxes of
$10^6$ n/cm$^2$s. The neutron spectrum measurement was performed at the TAPIRO
fast research reactor (ENEA, Casaccia) with fluxes of 10$^9$ n/cm$^2$s. The
obtained spectra were compared to Monte Carlo simulations, modeling detector
response with MCNP and Geant4.

Also, in comparison to the standard on-line neutron diagnostics (fission
chambers, silicon based detectors, scintillators), diamonds are less sensitive
to $\gamma$ rays, which represent a huge background in fusion devices. Finally,
their low leakage current at high temperature suppresses the detector intrinsic
noise. In this talk a CVD diamond based detector has been proposed for the
measurement of the 14 MeV neutrons from D-T fusion reaction. The detector was
arranged in a proton recoil telescope configuration, featuring a plastic
converter in front of the sensitive volume in order to induce the (n,p)
reaction. The segmentation of the sensitive volume, achieved by using two

Accuracy of ABC methods relies on the use of a small threshold value for
comparing simulations from the model and observed data. The proposed
methodology shows how to use large threshold values, while the number of
data-clones is increased to ease convergence towards an approximate maximum
likelihood estimate. We show how to exploit the methodology to reduce the

second equation of state also comes from lattice QCD and is a recent

the challenge of finding a suitable and well-behaved basis of tensor structures

jointly estimate the key parameters that describe the galaxy density field and
its spatial correlations in redshift space. Methods. We use the Bayesian
formalism to jointly reconstruct the redshift-space galaxy density field, power
spectrum, galaxy bias and galaxy luminosity function given the observations and
survey selection function. The high-dimensional posterior distribution is
explored using the Wiener filter within a Gibbs sampler. We validate the
analysis using simulated catalogues and apply it to VIPERS data taking into
consideration the inhomogeneous selection function. Results. We present joint
constraints on the anisotropic power spectrum as well as the bias and number
density of red and blue galaxy classes in luminosity and redshift bins as well
as the measurement covariances of these quantities. We find that the inferred
galaxy bias and number density parameters are strongly correlated although
these are only weakly correlated with the galaxy power spectrum. The power
spectrum and redshift-space distortion parameters are in agreement with
previous VIPERS results with the value of the growth rate $f\sigma_8 = 0.38$
with 18% uncertainty at redshift 0.7.

existence of fixed oxide charges in the thermally grown SiO2 layer and the
Si/SiO2 interface, the effective Si cross-sectional wall widths were
considerably narrower than the actual physical widths, due the formation of
depletion regions from both sides. These nanostructures were configured into a
metal-semiconductor-metal device configuration that was isolated from the
substrate region. Dark currents, dc-photo-response, and carrier
""time-of-flight"" response measurements using a mode-locked femtosecond laser,
were used in the study. In the narrowest wall devices, a considerable increase
in conductivity was observed as a result of higher carrier mobilities due to
lateral constriction and strain. The strain effects, which include the reversal
splitting of light- and heavy- hole bands as well as the decrease of
conduction-band effective mass by reduced Si bandgap energy, are formulated in
our microscopic model for explaining the experimentally observed enhancements
in both conduction- and valence-band mobilities with reduced Si wall thickness.
The role of the biaxial strain buffing depth is elucidated and the
quasi-quantum effect for the saturation hole mobility at small wall thickness
is also found and explained. Specifically, the enhancements of the valence-band
and conduction-band mobilities are found to be associated with different

the noninteracting topological classification occurs when the quantum nonlinear

For the tenfold way, we find that (i) the noninteracting topological

topological classification $\mathbb{Z}$ in even dimensions is always stable,
(iii) the noninteracting topological classification $\mathbb{Z}$ in odd

of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) with respect to water, is of special interest because
of the importance of C-N bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis. Comet-like
compositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and can
be readily explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry to form e.g. HCN
and an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advances
complexity[3]. Simple volatiles, including water and HCN, have been detected
previously in Solar Nebula analogues - protoplanetary disks around young stars
- indicating that they survive disk formation or are reformed in situ. It has
been hitherto unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic molecules
outside of the Solar Nebula, since recent observations show a dramatic change
in the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due
to accretion shocks[8]. Here we report the detection of CH3CN (and HCN and
HC3N) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480. We find
abundance ratios of these N-bearing organics in the gas-phase similar to
comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides in
the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles in
protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of the Solar Nebula
was not unique.

sensing to predictive spectrum mobility and dynamic spectrum access, depend on
our ability to foresee the state evolution of radio spectrum, raising a
fundamental question: To what degree is radio spectrum state (RSS) predictable?
In this paper, we explore the fundamental limits of predictability in RSS
dynamics by studying the RSS evolution patterns in spectrum bands of several
popular services, including TV bands, ISM bands, and Cellular bands, etc. From
an information theory perspective, we introduce a methodology of using
statistical entropy measures and Fano inequality to quantify the degree of
predictability underlying real-world spectrum measurements. Despite the
apparent randomness, we find a remarkable predictability, as large as 90%, in
the real-world RSS dynamics over a number of spectrum bands for all popular
services. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of
prediction-based spectrum sharing in 5G wireless communications.
