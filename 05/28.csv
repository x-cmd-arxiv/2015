the following: If for some ""good"" $\lambda \in K$ (in a sense that will be

many of the nearest habitable planets orbit dim, low-mass M stars, and will be

spectroscopy. Large rotation of macroscopic magnetic axes with temperature
observed from torque magnetometry agrees reasonably well with the rotation of
the $\mathbf{g}$ tensor above $T \gtrsim 50$~K. Below 50~K, the $\mathbf{g}$
tensor is temperature independent, while macroscopic magnetic axes continue to
rotate. Additionally, the susceptibility anisotropy has a temperature
dependence which cannot be reconciled with the isotropic Heisenberg model of
interactions between spins. ESR linewidth analysis shows that anisotropic
exchange interaction must be present in \csos. These findings strongly support
the presence of anisotropic exchange interactions in the Hamiltonian of the
studied system. Below $T_N=8$~K, the system enters a long - range
antiferromagnetically ordered state with easy axis along the $<\bar{1} 0 1>^*$

the antiferromagnetically ordered state suggesting strong spin-lattice coupling

generalise the standard analysis of direct detection experiments in terms of
spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI) interactions. We show that a
number of NREFT operators lead to distinctive new directional signatures, such
as prominent ring-like features in the directional recoil rate, even for
relatively low mass WIMPs. We discuss these signatures and how they could
affect the interpretation of future results from directional detectors. We
demonstrate that considering a range of possible operators introduces a factor
of 2 uncertainty in the number of events required to confirm the median recoil
direction of the signal. Furthermore, using directional detection, it is
possible to distinguish the more general NREFT interactions from the standard
SI/SD interactions at the $2\sigma$ level with $\mathcal{O}(100-500)$ events.
In particular, we demonstrate that for certain NREFT operators, directional
sensitivity provides the only method of distinguishing them from these standard
operators, highlighting the importance of directional detectors in probing the
particle physics of dark matter.

algorithm to model subsurface induction sensors, traversing planar-layered
geological formations of arbitrary EM material anisotropy and loss, which are
used, for example, in the exploration of hydrocarbon reserves. Unlike past
pseudo-analytical planar-layered modeling algorithms that impose parallelism
between the formation's bed junctions however, our method involves judicious
employment of Transformation Optics techniques to address challenges related to
modeling relative slope (i.e., tilting) between said junctions (including
arbitrary azimuth orientation of each junction). The algorithm exhibits this
flexibility, both with respect to loss and anisotropy in the formation layers
as well as junction tilting, via employing special planar slabs that coat each
""flattened"" (i.e., originally tilted) planar interface, locally redirecting the
incident wave within the coating slabs to cause wave fronts to interact with
the flattened interfaces as if they were still tilted with a specific,
user-defined orientation. Moreover, since the coating layers are homogeneous
rather than exhibiting continuous material variation, a minimal number of these
layers must be inserted and hence reduces added simulation time and
computational expense. As said coating layers are not reflectionless however,
they do induce artificial field scattering that corrupts legitimate field
signatures due to the (effective) interface tilting. Numerical results, for two
half-spaces separated by a tilted interface, quantify error trends versus
material and sensor characteristics. We finally exhibit responses of sensors
traversing three-layered media, where we vary the anisotropy, loss, and
relative tilting of the formations and explore the sensitivity of the sensor's
complex-valued measurements.

predictors and a possible nonlinear effect. The dimensionality was first
reduced via a high-dimensional (approximate) factor model implemented by the
principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel
forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of
sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to
deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis
will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a
semi-parametric (approximate) factor model is assumed. Our method is also
applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors.
The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning
architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly
estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of
a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the
sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the
cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic
properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection
directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We
further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target
on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this
central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be
larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the
sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation

modality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to
form images of the absorbed optical energy density within tissue. When the
imaging system employs conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, the
ideal photoacoustic (PA) signals are degraded by the transducers'
acousto-electric impulse responses (EIRs) during the measurement process. If
unaccounted for, this can degrade the accuracy of the reconstructed image. In
principle, the effect of the EIRs on the measured PA signals can be ameliorated
via deconvolution; images can be reconstructed subsequently by application of a
reconstruction method that assumes an idealized EIR. Alternatively, the effect
of the EIR can be incorporated into an imaging model and implicitly compensated
for during reconstruction. In either case, the efficacy of the correction can
be limited by errors in the assumed EIRs. In this work, a joint optimization
approach to PACT image reconstruction is proposed for mitigating errors in
reconstructed images that are caused by use of an inaccurate EIR. The method
exploits the bi-linear nature of the imaging model and seeks to refine the
measured EIR during the process of reconstructing the sought-after absorbed
optical energy density. Computer-simulation and experimental studies are
conducted to investigate the numerical properties of the method and demonstrate
its value for mitigating image distortions and enhancing the visibility of fine
structures.

learn the desired invariances, we train it with triplets of images selected
from datasets which present a challenging variability in visual appearance. The
triplets are selected in such way that two samples are from the same location

mean-squared error from the Cramer-Rao bound when the signal-to-noise ratio
falls below a threshold SNR. In many cases, the threshold effect is caused by a
subspace swap event, when the measured data (or its sample covariance) is
better approximated by a subset of components of an orthogonal subspace than by
the components of a signal subspace. We derive analytical lower bounds on the
probability of a subspace swap in compressively measured noisy data. These
bounds guide our understanding of threshold effects and performance breakdown
for parameter estimation using compression. As a case study, we investigate
threshold effects in maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of directions of
arrival of two closely-spaced sources using co-prime subsampling. Our results
show the impact of compression on threshold SNR. A rule of thumb is that every
doubling of compression ratio brings a penalty in threshold SNR of 3 dB.

that the underlying equation of state must also account for the observation of

challenge, we compute in a model-independent way the underlying equation of

adopted, the equation of state follows directly from the implementation of
Lindblom's algorithm; assumptions on the nature or composition of the dense
stellar core are not required. By analyzing mass-radius profiles with a maximum
mass consistent with observation and common radii in the 8 to 11 km range, a
lower limit on the stellar radius of a $1.4M_{\odot}$ neutron star of $R_{\rm

the normal direction with prescribed speed function F. The assumptions on F are
that it does not depend on the front itself, but can depend on space and time.
Moreover, it can vanish and change sign. To solve this problem the Level-Set
Method [Osher, Sethian; 1988] is widely used, and the Generalized Fast Marching
Method [Carlini et al.; 2008] has recently been introduced. The novelty of our
method is that its overall computational complexity is predicted to be
comparable to that of the Fast Marching Method [Sethian; 1996], [Vladimirsky;
2006] in most instances. This latter algorithm is O(N^n log N^n) if the
computational domain comprises N^n points. Our strategy is to use it in regions
where the speed is bounded away from zero -- and switch to a different
formalism when F is approximately 0. To this end, a collection of so-called
sideways partial differential equations is introduced. Their solutions locally
describe the evolving front and depend on both space and time. The
well-posedness of those equations, as well as their geometric properties are
addressed. We then propose a convergent and stable discretization of those
PDEs. Those alternative representations are used to augment the standard Fast
Marching Method. The resulting algorithm is presented together with a thorough
discussion of its features. The accuracy of the scheme is tested when F depends
on both space and time. Each example yields an O(1/N) global truncation error.
We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of our method.

the universe, which cannot exceed the relic dark matter density and is a
quantity of great interest in axion experiments like ADMX, is a result of the
early-universe interplay between cosmological evolution and the axion mass as a
function of temperature. The latter quantity is proportional to the second
derivative of the QCD free energy with respect to the CP-violating phase,
$\theta$. However, this quantity is generically non-perturbative and previous
calculations have only employed instanton models at the high temperatures of
interest (roughly 1 GeV). In this and future works, we aim to calculate the
temperature-dependent axion mass at small $\theta$ from first-principle lattice
calculations, with controlled statistical and systematic errors. Once
calculated, this temperature-dependent axion mass is input for the classical
evolution equations of the axion density of the universe. Due to a variety of
lattice systematic effects at the very high temperatures required, we perform a
calculation of the leading small-$\theta$ cumulant of the theta vacua on large
volume lattices for SU(3) Yang-Mills with high statistics as a first proof of
concept, before attempting a full QCD calculation in the future. From these

greatly desensitizes the fiber output from any input illumination variations,
thereby stabilizing the instrument profile of the spectrograph and improving

variations and seeing changes. By selecting the appropriate glass and lens
diameter the highest efficiency is achieved when the fibers are practically in

compared to classical double-scrambler systems. This prototype double-scrambler
has demonstrated significant performance gains over previous systems, achieving
scrambling gains in excess of 10,000 with a throughput of $\sim$87% using
uncoated Polymicro octagonal fibers. Adding a circular fiber to the fiber train
further increases the scrambling gain to $>$20,000, limited by laboratory
measurement error. While this fiber system is designed for the Habitable-zone

preserved to within 9 degrees and the VPOS flattening is almost unchanged (31
kpc height). Interestingly, the shortest distance of the VPOS plane from the MW
center is now only 2.5 kpc, indicating that the new discoveries balance out the
VPOS at the Galactic center. The vast majority of the MW satellites are thus
consistent with sharing a similar orbital plane as the Magellanic Clouds,
confirming a hypothesis proposed by Kunkel & Demers and Lynden-Bell almost 40
years ago. We predict the absolute proper motions of the new objects assuming
they orbit within the VPOS. Independent of the VPOS results we also predict the
velocity dispersions of the new systems under three distinct assumptions: that
they (i) are dark-matter-free star clusters obeying Newtonian dynamics, (ii)
are dwarf satellites lying on empirical scaling relations of galaxies in dark
matter halos, and (iii) obey MOND.

J0845+2257 (Ton 345). Using high-resolution HST/COS and VLT spectroscopy, we
have detected hydrogen and eleven metals in the atmosphere of the white dwarf.
The origin of these metals is almost certainly the circumstellar disc of dusty
and gaseous debris from a tidally-disrupted planetesimal, accreting at a rate
of 1.6E10 gs^-1. Studying the chemical abundances of the accreted material
demonstrates that the planetesimal had a composition similar to the Earth,
dominated by rocky silicates and metallic iron, with a low water content. The
mass of metals within the convection zone of the white dwarf corresponds to an
asteroid of at least ~130-170 km in diameter, although the presence of ongoing
accretion from the debris disc implies that the planetesimal was probably
larger than this. While a previous abundance study of the accreted material has
shown an anomalously high mass fraction of carbon (15 percent) compared to the
bulk Earth, our independent analysis results in a carbon abundance of just 2.5
percent. Enhanced abundances of core material (Fe, Ni) suggest that the
accreted object may have lost a portion of its mantle, possibly due to stellar
wind stripping in the asymptotic giant branch. Time-series spectroscopy reveals
variable emission from the orbiting gaseous disc, demonstrating that the
evolved planetary system at SDSS J0845+2257 is dynamically active.

transmit supersymmetry breaking from the hidden to the MSSM observable sector,

superpotential messenger-MSSM Yukawa couplings to generate sizeable mixing,
thus reintroducing the flavor problem; ii) To extend the MSSM Higgs sector with
singlets and/or triplets providing extra tree-level corrections to the Higgs
mass. Singlets will not get any soft mass from GMSB and triplets will
contribute to the $\rho$ parameter which could be an issue. In this paper we
explore the second way by introducing extra supersymmetric triplets with
hypercharges $Y=(0,\pm 1)$, with a tree-level custodial $SU(2)_L\otimes
SU(2)_R$ global symmetry in the Higgs sector protecting the $\rho$ parameter: a
supersymmetric generalization of the Georgi-Machacek model, dubbed as

running from the messenger to the electroweak scale mildly breaks the custodial

SWCX and LB foreground models implies that, if the foreground is dominated by
SWCX and is brighter than ~1.5e-12 erg/cm^2/s/deg^2 (0.4-1.0 keV), then using

observe a net decline in cluster formation efficiency ($\Gamma$, i.e. the
amount of star formation happening in bound clusters) from about 26 % in the
inner region to 8 % in the outer part of the galaxy. The recovered $\Gamma$
values within different regions of M83 follow the same $\Gamma$ versus star
formation rate density relation observed for entire galaxies. We also probe the
initial cluster mass function (ICMF) as a function of galactocentric distance.
We observe a significant steepening of the ICMF in the outer regions (from
$-1.90\pm0.11$ to $-2.70\pm0.14$) and for the whole galactic cluster population
(slope of $-2.18\pm0.07$) of M83. We show that this change of slope reflects a
more fundamental change of the 'truncation mass' at the high-mass end of the
distribution. This can be modelled as a Schechter function of slope $-2$ with
an exponential cut-off mass ($M_{\rm c}$) that decreases significantly from the
inner to the outer regions (from 4.00 to $0.25\times 10^5$ M$_\odot$) while the
galactic $M_{\rm c}$ is $\approx1.60\times10^5$ M$_\odot$. The trends in \Gamma
and ICMF are consistent with the observed radial decrease of the $\Sigma({\rm
H}_2)$, hence in gas pressure. As gas pressure declines cluster formation
becomes less efficient. We conclude that the host galaxy environment appears to
regulate 1) the fraction of stars locked in clusters; 2) the upper mass limit

Standard Model through a Higgs portal coupling. However, we find that in a
minimal model in which the scalar generates inflation, this mechanism does not
stabilize the potential because the mass required for inflation is beyond the
instability scale. This conclusion does not change if the Higgs has a direct
weak coupling to the scalar curvature. On the other hand, if the potential is
absolutely stable, successful inflation in agreement with current CMB data can
occur along a valley of the potential with a Mexican hat profile. We revisit
the stability conditions, independently of inflation, and clarify that the
threshold effect cannot work if the Higgs portal coupling is too small. We also
show that inflation in a false Higgs vacuum appearing radiatively for a tuned
ratio of the Higgs and top masses leads to an amplitude of primordial
gravitational waves that is far too high, ruling out this possibility.

neglected. While in linear theory the BAO peak decreases for increasing

opposite direction, since the peak broadening by large scale flows is less
effective. As a result of this combined effect, the peak decreases by $\sim 0.6

homogeneous geometries that also contain statistical information about

quantities of observational interest. Basic uncertainty relations of
(non-commutative) Fourier transforms imply that this statistical description
can only be compatible with the observed near-homogeneity of the Universe if
the typical length scale associated to the distribution is much larger than the
fundamental 'Planck' scale. As an example of effective cosmological equations

spectrum of astrophysical nebulae, making it a very attractive observational
tool with which to survey galaxies. Moreover as a UV resonance line, Lya
possesses several unique characteristics that make it useful to study the ISM
and ionizing stellar population at all cosmic epochs. In this review I present
a summary of Lya observations of galaxies in the nearby universe. At UV
magnitudes reachable with current facilities, only ~5% of the local galaxy
population shows a Lya equivalent width (EW_Lya) that exceeds 20\AA. This
fraction increases dramatically at higher z, but only in the local universe can
we study galaxies in detail and assemble unprecedented multi-wavelength
datasets. I discuss many local Lya observations, showing that when galaxies
show net Lya emission, they ubiquitously produce large halos of scattered Lya,
that dominate the integrated luminosity. We discuss how global EW_Lya and the
Lya escape fraction (fescLya) are higher (EW_Lya >~ 20\AA\ and fescLya> 10%) in
galaxies that represent the less massive and younger end of the distributions
for local objects. This is connected with various properties, such that
Lya-emitters have lower metallicities (median value of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.1) and
dust reddening. However, the presence of galactic outflows is also vital to
Doppler shift the Lya line out of resonance with the HI, as high EW_Lya is
found only among galaxies with winds faster than ~50km/s. The evidence is then
assembled into a coherent picture, and the requirement for star formation
driven feedback is discussed in the context of an evolutionary sequence where
the ISM is accelerated and/or subject to fluid instabilities, which reduce the
scattering of Lya. Concluding remarks take the form of perspectives upon the
most pressing questions that can be answered by observation.

interest for estimating the impact that the asset encumbrance by the cover pool

explore one-period structural modelling approaches for covered bonds and senior
unsecured debt losses with one and two asset value variables respectively.
Obviously, two-assets models with separate values of the cover pool and the

demonstrate that exact calibration of such models may be impossible. We also
investigate a one-asset model in which the riskiness of the cover pool is

Donoho for efficient sampling of sparse signals in 2006 and has vast
applications in signal processing. The expicit restricted isometry property
(RIP) measurement matrices are needed in practice. Since 2007 R. DeVore, J.
Bourgain et al and R. Calderbank et al have given several deterministic
cosntrcutions of RIP matrices from various mathematical objects. On the other
hand the strong coherence property of a measurement matrix was introduced by
Bajwa and Calderbank et al for the recovery of signals under the noisy
measuremnt. In this paper we propose new explicit construction of real valued
RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing from algebraic geometry. Our
construction indicates that using more general algebraic-geometric objects
rather than curves (AG codes), RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing
can be constructed with much smaller coherence and much bigger sparsity orders.
The RIP matrices from algebraic geometry also have a nice asymptotic bound
matching the bound from the previous constructions of Bourgain et al and the
small-bias sets. On the negative side, we prove that the RIP matrices from
DeVore's construction, its direct algebraic geometric generalization and one of
our new construction do not satisfy the strong coherence property. However we
give a modified version of AG-RIP matrices which satisfies the strong coherence
property. Therefore the new RIP matrices in compressed sensing from our
modified algebraic geometric construction can be used for the recovery of
signals from the noisy measurement.

Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from
wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct
spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image
recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the
fiber output. We provide a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding
using Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of

major challenge in modern cancer biology. One canonical cell-fate decision that
cancer cells undergo is Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its
reverse Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET). While transitioning between
these two phenotypes - epithelial and mesenchymal - cells can also attain a
hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (i.e. partial or intermediate EMT) phenotype.
Cells in this phenotype have mixed epithelial (e.g. adhesion) and mesenchymal
(e.g. migration) properties, thereby allowing them to move collectively as
clusters of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). If these clusters enter the
circulation, they can be more apoptosis-resistant and more capable of
initiating metastatic lesions than cancer cells moving individually with wholly
mesenchymal phenotypes, having undergo a complete EMT. Here, we review the
operating principles of the core regulatory network for EMT/MET that acts as a
three-way switch giving rise to three distinct phenotypes - epithelial,
mesenchymal and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal. We further characterize this
hybrid E/M phenotype in terms of its capabilities in terms of collective cell
migration, tumor-initiation, cell-cell communication, and drug resistance. We
elucidate how the highly interconnected coupling between these modules
coordinates cell-fate decisions among a population of cancer cells in the
dynamic tumor, hence facilitating tumor-stoma interactions, formation of CTC
clusters, and consequently cancer metastasis. Finally, we discuss the multiple
advantages that the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype have as compared to
a complete EMT phenotype and argue that these collectively migrating cells are
the primary 'bad actors' of metastasis.

technique for protecting data privacy. In this paper, we focus on a very
sensitive and increasingly exposed type of data: location data. There are two
main scenarios in which fake traces are of extreme value to preserve location
privacy: publishing datasets of location trajectories, and using location-based
services. Despite advances in protecting (location) data privacy, there is no
quantitative method to evaluate how realistic a synthetic trace is, and how
much utility and privacy it provides in each scenario. Also, the lack of a
methodology to generate privacy-preserving fake traces is evident. In this
paper, we fill this gap and propose the first statistical metric and model to
generate fake location traces such that both the utility of data and the
privacy of users are preserved. We build upon the fact that, although
geographically they visit distinct locations, people have strongly semantically
similar mobility patterns, for example, their transition pattern across
activities (e.g., working, driving, staying at home) is similar. We define a
statistical metric and propose an algorithm that automatically discovers the
hidden semantic similarities between locations from a bag of real location
traces as seeds, without requiring any initial semantic annotations. We
guarantee that fake traces are geographically dissimilar to their seeds, so
they do not leak sensitive location information. We also protect contributors
to seed traces against membership attacks. Interleaving fake traces with mobile
users' traces is a prominent location privacy defense mechanism. We
quantitatively show the effectiveness of our methodology in protecting against
localization inference attacks while preserving utility of sharing/publishing
traces.

nanostructures in which each component is of a distinct type and has a defined

requires inter-component interaction energies to increase logarithmically with
structure size, in order to counter the entropy gained upon mixing component
types in solution. However, self-assembly in the presence of strong
interactions results in general in kinetic trapping, so suggesting a limit to
the size of an (equilibrium) structure that can be self-assembled from

hierarchical assembly scheme already considered in experiment. We show that
this scheme is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong `native'
interactions (interactions designed to stabilize the intended structure), and
so, in principle, offers a way to make large information-rich structures. In
this scheme the size of an assembled structure scales exponentially with the
stage of assembly, and assembly can continue as long as random motion is able
to bring structures into contact. The resulting superstructure could provide a
template for building in the third dimension. The chief drawback of this scheme
is that it is particularly susceptible to kinetic traps that result from
`non-native' interactions (interactions not required to stabilize the intended
structure); the scale on which such a scheme can be realized therefore depends
upon how effectively this latter kind of interaction can be suppressed.

that share the same main memory system, causing interference among memory
requests from different agents. The result of this interference, if not
controlled well, is missed deadlines for HWAs and low CPU performance.
State-of-the-art mechanisms designed for CPU-GPU systems strive to meet a
target frame rate for GPUs by prioritizing the GPU close to the time when it
has to complete a frame. We observe two major problems when such an approach is
adapted to a heterogeneous CPU-HWA system. First, HWAs miss deadlines because
they are prioritized only close to their deadlines. Second, such an approach
does not consider the diverse memory access characteristics of different
applications running on CPUs and HWAs, leading to low performance for
latency-sensitive CPU applications and deadline misses for some HWAs, including
GPUs.
  In this paper, we propose a Simple Quality of service Aware memory Scheduler
for Heterogeneous systems (SQUASH), that overcomes these problems using three
key ideas, with the goal of meeting deadlines of HWAs while providing high CPU
performance. First, SQUASH prioritizes a HWA when it is not on track to meet
its deadline any time during a deadline period. Second, SQUASH prioritizes HWAs
over memory-intensive CPU applications based on the observation that the
performance of memory-intensive applications is not sensitive to memory
latency. Third, SQUASH treats short-deadline HWAs differently as they are more
likely to miss their deadlines and schedules their requests based on worst-case
memory access time estimates.
  Extensive evaluations across a wide variety of different workloads and
systems show that SQUASH achieves significantly better CPU performance than the
best previous scheduler while always meeting the deadlines for all HWAs,
including GPUs, thereby largely improving frame rates.

the largest number of interactions in their birth environment. Yet the stellar
dynamics during this crucial phase are poorly understood. Here we analyze the
radial velocities measured for 152 out of 380 observed stars in the 2-6 Myr old
star cluster IC 348 as part of the SDSS-III APOGEE. The radial velocity
distribution of these stars is fitted with one or two Gaussians, convolved with
the measurement uncertainties including binary orbital motions. Including a
second Gaussian improves the fit; the high-velocity outliers that are best fit
by this second component may either (1) be contaminants from the nearby Perseus
OB2 association, (2) be a halo of ejected or dispersing stars from IC 348, or
(3) reflect that IC 348 has not relaxed to a Gaussian velocity distribution. We
measure a velocity dispersion for IC 348 of $0.72 \pm 0.07$ km s$^{-1}$ (or
$0.64 \pm 0.08$ km s$^{-1}$ if two Gaussians are fitted), which implies a
supervirial state, unless the gas contributes more to the gravitational
potential than expected. No evidence is found for a dependence of this velocity
dispersion on distance from the cluster center or stellar mass. We also find
that stars with lower extinction (in the front of the cloud) tend to be
redshifted compared with stars with somewhat higher extinction (towards the
back of the cloud). This data suggests that the stars in IC 348 are converging
along the line of sight. We show that this correlation between radial velocity
and extinction is unlikely to be spuriously caused by the small cluster
rotation of $0.024 \pm 0.013$ km s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$ or by correlations
between the radial velocities of neighboring stars. This signature, if
confirmed, will be the first detection of line-of-sight convergence in a star
cluster(...)

particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature

Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has
been explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security
goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security
definitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the
quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on
different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty
signature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical
-- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two
existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security
framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature
protocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case,
proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability.
Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key
distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.

methods based on the idea of computing $p$-norms via fast convolution: The
first method proposed, with runtime in $O( k \log(k) \log(\log(k)) )$ (which is
less than $18 k \log(k)$ for any vectors that can be practically realized),
uses the $p$-norm as a direct approximation of the Chebyshev norm. The second
approach proposed, with runtime in $O( k \log(k) )$ (although in practice both
perform similarly), uses a novel null space projection method, which extracts
information from a sequence of $p$-norms to estimate the maximum value in the
vector (this is equivalent to querying a small number of moments from a
distribution of bounded support in order to estimate the maximum). The $p$-norm
approaches are compared to one another and are shown to compute an
approximation of the Viterbi path in a hidden Markov model where the transition
matrix is a Toeplitz matrix; the runtime of approximating the Viterbi path is
thus reduced from $O( n k^2 )$ steps to $O( n $k \log(k))$ steps in practice,

concentration at the transition decreases with increasing the difference of the
solvation chemical potential between liquid and gas. As a typical
bubble-forming solute, we consider ${\rm O}_2$ in ambient liquid water, which
exhibits mild hydrophobicity and its critical temperature is lower than that of
water. Such a solute can be expelled from the liquid to form gaseous domains
while the surrounding liquid pressure is higher than the saturated vapor
pressure $p_{cx}$. This solute-induced bubble formation is a first-order
transition in bulk and on a partially dried wall, while a gas film grows
continuously on a completely dried wall. We set up a bubble free energy $\Delta
G$ for bulk and surface bubbles with a small volume fraction $\phi$. It becomes
a function of the bubble radius $R$ under the Laplace pressure balance. Then,
for sufficiently large solute densities above a threshold, $\Delta G$ exhibits
a local maximum at a critical radius and a minimum at an equilibrium radius. We
also examine solute-induced nucleation taking place outside CX, where bubbles
larger than the critical radius grow until attainment of equilibrium.

comes with descriptions and reviews, and with profile pictures of people who
frequent them. Descriptions and reviews have been widely explored in the
research area of data mining. By contrast, profile pictures have received
little attention. Previous work showed that people are able to partly guess a
place's ambiance, clientele, and activities not only by observing the place
itself but also by observing the profile pictures of its visitors. Here we
further that work by determining which visual cues people may have relied upon
to make their guesses; showing that a state-of-the-art algorithm could make
predictions more accurately than humans at times; and demonstrating that the
visual cues people relied upon partly differ from those of the algorithm.

hydrogen concentration and high temperature. These factors are found to
individually induce degradation in the mechanical strength of Pd in a
monotonous manner. In addition, defects such as vacancies and grain boundaries
could provide a driving force for hydrogen segregation, thus enhance the
tendency for their trapping. The simulations show that hydrogen maintains the
highest localization at grain boundaries at ambient temperatures. This finding
correlates well with the experimental observation that hydrogen embrittlement
is more frequently observed around room temperature. The strength-limiting

a cell to recover its sensitivity after a transient response to a shift in the
strength of extracellular stimulus. The working principles of adaptation have
been established previously based on rate equations which do not consider
fluctuations in a thermal environment. Recently, G. Lan et al. (Nature Phys.,
8:422-8, 2012) performed a detailed analysis of a stochastic model for the E.
coli sensory network. They showed that accurate adaptation is possible only
when the system operates in a nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS). They further
proposed an energy-speed-accuracy (ESA) trade-off relation. We present here
analytic results on the NESS of the model through a mapping to a
one-dimensional birth-death process. An exact expression for the entropy
production rate is also derived. Based on these results, we are able to discuss
the ESA relation in a more general setting. Our study suggests that the
adaptation error can be reduced exponentially as the methylation range
increases. Finally, we show that a nonequilibrium phase transition exists in
the infinite methylation range limit, despite the fact that the model contains
only two discrete variables.

whose distribution function satisfies $F(0) = p_c = 1/2$. This is sometimes
known as the ""critical case"" because large clusters of zero-weight edges force
passage times to grow at most logarithmically, giving zero time constant.
Denote $T(\mathbf{0}, \partial B(n))$ as the passage time from the origin to
the boundary of the box $[-n,n] \times [-n,n]$. We characterize the limit
behavior of $T(\mathbf{0}, \partial B(n))$ by conditions on the distribution

several questions of Kesten and Zhang from the '90s and, in particular,
disprove a conjecture of Zhang from '99. In the case when both the mean and the
variance go to infinity as $n \to \infty$, we prove a CLT under a minimal
moment assumption. The main tool involves a new relation between first-passage
percolation and invasion percolation: up to a constant factor, the passage time

exciting method for the design of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices.
Using density functional theory, we investigatethe structural and electronic
properties of two heterostruc-tures, graphene/phosphorene (G/BP) and hexagonal
boron nitride/phosphorene (BN/BP). We found that the interlayer distance,
binding energy, and charge transfer in G/BP and BN/BP are similar. Interlayer
noncovalentbonding is predicted due to the weak coupling between the pz orbital
of BP and the {\pi} orbital of graphene and BN. A small amount of electron
transfer from graphene and BN, scaling with the vertical strain, renders BP
slightly n-doped for both heterostructures. Several attractive characteristics
of BP, including direct band gap and linear dichroism, are preserved. However,
a large redistribution of electrostatic potential across the interface is
observed, which may significantly renormalize the carrier dynamics and affect
the excitonic behavior of BP. Our work suggests that graphene and BN can be
used not only as an effective capping layer to protect BP from its structural
and chemical degradation while still maintain its major electronic
characteristics, but also as an active layer to tune the carrier dynamics and
optical properties of BP.

In this work, we consider the so-called Hojman symmetry in $f(T)$ theory.
Unlike Noether conservation theorem, the symmetry vectors and the corresponding
conserved quantities in Hojman conservation theorem can be obtained by using
directly the equations of motion, rather than Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. We
find that Hojman symmetry can exist in $f(T)$ theory, and the corresponding
exact cosmological solutions are obtained. We find that the functional form of
$f(T)$ is restricted to be the power-law or hypergeometric type, while the
universe experiences a power-law or hyperbolic expansion. These results are
different from the ones obtained by using Noether symmetry in $f(T)$ theory.
Therefore, it is reasonable to find exact cosmological solutions via Hojman
symmetry.

deployment in a number of high-consequence security settings, such as LAX
canine patrols and Federal Air Marshal Service. These models focus on isolated
systems with only one defender, despite being part of a more complex system
with multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation
networks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and,
consequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. To
understand such multidefender strategic interactions present in security, we
investigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders.
Unlike most prior analysis, we focus on the situations in which each defender
must protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender's best response
decision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical
investigation of multidefender security games with independent targets,
offering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with
increasing generality. In all models, we find that defenders have the incentive
to over-protect targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler
models, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing
both in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender.
Considering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixed-integer
linear programming formulation to compute a defender's best response, and make
use of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply
this approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of
networks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks.
Our analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread
determine the propensity of defenders to over- or under-invest in security.

inner radius coincides with the CO snow line, it is not apparent why N$_2$H$^+$
is abundant outside the CO snow line in spite of the similar sublimation
temperatures of CO and N$_2$. Using the full gas-grain network model, we
reproduced the N$_2$H$^+$ ring in a disk model with millimeter grains. The
chemical conversion of CO and N$_2$ to less volatile species (sink effect
hereinafter) is found to affect the N$_2$H$^+$ distribution. Since the
efficiency of the sink depends on various parameters such as activation
barriers of grain surface reactions, which are not well constrained, we also
constructed the no-sink model; the total (gas and ice) CO and N$_2$ abundances
are set constant, and their gaseous abundances are given by the balance between
adsorption and desorption. Abundances of molecular ions in the no-sink model
are calculated by analytical formulas, which are derived by analyzing the
full-network model. The N$_2$H$^+$ ring is reproduced by the no-sink model, as
well. The 2D (R-Z) distribution of N$_2$H$^+$, however, is different among the
full-network model and no-sink model. The column density of N$_2$H$^+$ in the
no-sink model depends sensitively on the desorption rate of CO and N$_2$, and
the flux of cosmic ray. We also found that N$_2$H$^+$ abundance can peak at the

discrete logarithms (DL) in finite fields $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$, with $p$ medium
to large and $n \geq 1$ small. This algorithm comprises four steps: polynomial
selection, relation collection, linear algebra and finally, individual
logarithm computation. The first step outputs two polynomials defining two
number fields, and a map from the polynomial ring over the integers modulo each
of these polynomials to $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$. After the relation collection and
linear algebra phases, the (virtual) logarithm of a subset of elements in each
number field is known. Given the target element in $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$, the
fourth step computes a preimage in one number field. If one can write the
target preimage as a product of elements of known (virtual) logarithm, then one
can deduce the discrete logarithm of the target. As recently shown by the
Logjam attack, this final step can be critical when it can be computed very
quickly. But we realized that computing an individual DL is much slower in
medium-and large-characteristic non-prime fields $\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$ with $n
\geq 3$, compared to prime fields and quadratic fields $\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}$. We
optimize the first part of individual DL: the \emph{booting step}, by reducing
dramatically the size of the preimage norm. Its smoothness probability is
higher, hence the running-time of the booting step is much improved. Our method
is very efficient for small extension fields with $2 \leq n \leq 6$ and applies
to any $n \textgreater{} 1$, in medium and large characteristic.

detailed non-linear magnetorheological properties of three MR fluids (10 vol%)

magnetorheological Payne effect i.e. rapid stress relaxation under increasing
deformation and uniform magnetic field beyond linear viscoelastic region (LVR),
which has not been studied in-depth in conventional MR fluids. We have also
shown that stress softening was more pronounced for MR fluids with higher
anisotropic contents, in contrast to isotropic MR fluid. The onset strains for
LVR to non-linear region transition for anisotropic fluids were much lower than
that of isotropic spherical nanoparticle-containing fluid. The stronger MR
response for nanorod-containing MR fluids can be explained in terms of enhanced

direct detection of neutral hydrogen, via the redshifted 21-cm line, has yet

ongoing surveys, and could open up the entire universe from $z\sim$6-200 for
astrophysical and cosmological studies, opening not only the EoR, but also its

statistical detections of the 21-cm signal during the EoR, with limited

lower redshifts, as well as higher redshifts will remain out of reach. The

studied on the basis of the stochastic equation formalism. The calculated
diffusion coefficient accounts for the vibrations of the diffusing molecule and
zeolite framework, molecule-zeolite interaction, and specific structure of the
zeolite. It is shown that when the interaction potential is predominantly
determined by the zeolite pore structure, the diffusion coefficient varies
periodically with the number of carbon atoms of the alkane molecule, a
phenomenon called resonant diffusion. A criterion for observable resonance is
obtained from the balance between the interaction potentials of the molecule
due to the atomic and pore structures of the zeolite. It shows that the
diffusion is not resonant in zeolites without pore structure, such as ZSM-12.
Moreover, even in zeolites with developed pore structure no resonant dependence
of the diffusion constant can be detected if the pore structure energy barriers
are not at least three times higher than the atomic structure energy barriers.
The role of the alkane molecule vibrations is examined as well and a surprising
effect of suppression of the diffusion in comparison with the case of a rigid
molecule is observed. This effect is explained with the balance between the
static and dynamic interaction of the molecule and zeolite.

reaches in a few seconds the critical mass, and gravitationally collapses to a

maximum dimensionless angular momentum value, $[c J/(G M^2)]_{\rm max}\approx

""extended"" master function. In finite types, this yields a correspondence
between the Bethe eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the cyclotomic Gaudin model
and those of an ""extended"" non-cyclotomic Gaudin model. We proceed to define
populations of solutions to the cyclotomic Bethe equations, in the sense of
[Mukhin E., Varchenko A., Commun. Contemp. Math. 6 (2004), 111-163,
math.QA/0209017], for diagram automorphisms of Kac-Moody Lie algebras. In the
case of type A with the diagram automorphism, we associate to each population a
vector space of quasi-polynomials with specified ramification conditions. This
vector space is equipped with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gradation and a non-degenerate
bilinear form which is (skew-)symmetric on the even (resp. odd) graded
subspace. We show that the population of cyclotomic critical points is
isomorphic to the variety of isotropic full flags in this space.

the chaos persists even in Penrose limits or not. In this paper, we show that
sub-leading corrections in a Penrose limit provide an unstable separatrix, so
that chaotic motions are generated as a consequence of collapsed
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori. Our analysis is based on deriving a reduced
system composed of two degrees of freedom by supposing a winding string ansatz.
Then, we provide support for the existence of chaos by computing Poincare

negative differential conductance (NDC), in which an increase in voltage across
the device terminals results in a decrease in the electrical current passing

the theory of NDC in single-molecule junctions, where simple models are

radio jets also roughly follow the well-known trend of centimeter luminosity
against bolometric luminosity determined for YSOs, assuming they belong to
Taurus, although they present some excess of radio emission compared to the
known relation for YSOs. Nonetheless, we are able to reproduce the flux
densities of the radio jets modeling the centimeter emission of the thermal
radio jets using the same type of models applied to YSOs, but with
corresponding smaller stellar wind velocities and mass-loss rates, and
exploring different possible geometries of the wind or outflow from the star.
Moreover, we also find that the modeled mass outflow rates for the bolometric
luminosities of our objects agree reasonably well with the trends found between
the mass outflow rates and bolometric luminosities of YSOs, which indicates
that, despite the ""excess"" centimeter emission, the intrinsic properties of
proto-brown dwarfs are consistent with a continuation of those of very low mass
stars to a lower mass range. Overall, our study favors the formation of brown
dwarfs as a scaled-down version of low-mass stars.

representative for those of the overall population of Galactic cosmic rays and
if the slope of the cosmic ray spectrum varies across the Galaxy. We use the
data of Fermi Space gamma-ray Telescope to derive a measurement of the slope of
the cosmic ray spectrum across the Galactic Disk and to compare it with that of
the Large Magellanic Cloud cosmic rays. A special choice of the background
estimation regions allows us to single out the neutral pion decay component of
the gamma-ray flux in the energy range above 10 GeV and to separate it from (a)
emission from the local interstellar medium around the Solar system and (b)
from the inverse Compton emission produced by cosmic ray electrons. Results.
The spectrum of the pion decay gamma-ray emission from the Galactic disk in the
energy band 10 GeV - 1 TeV has the slope 2.4. There is no evidence for the
variation of the slope with Galactic longitude / distance from the Galactic
Centre. The slope of the spectrum of cosmic rays derived from the gamma-ray
data, 2.45, is harder than the slope of the locally observed cosmic ray proton
spectrum. Pion decay emission from a powerlaw distribution of cosmic rays with
the same hard slope also provides a fit to the gamma-ray spectrum of the Large
Magellanic Cloud. Identical and hard slopes of the spectra of cosmic rays in
the Milky Way and in the Large Magellanic Cloud are consistent with a
straightforward theoretical model in which cosmic rays are injected by shock
acceleration with the spectrum with the slope 2...2.1 which is subsequently

Analysis for inferring geometric and topological features from point clouds. In
this context, the distance to a probability measure (DTM) has been introduced
by Chazal et al. (2011) as a robust alternative to the distance a compact set.
In practice, the DTM can be estimated by its empirical counterpart, that is the
distance to the empirical measure (DTEM). In this paper we give a tight control
of the deviation of the DTEM. Our analysis relies on a local analysis of
empirical processes. In particular, we show that the rates of convergence of
the DTEM directly depends on the regularity at zero of a particular quantile
fonction which contains some local information about the geometry of the
support. This quantile function is the relevant quantity to describe precisely
how difficult is a geometric inference problem. Several numerical experiments
illustrate the convergence of the DTEM and also confirm that our bounds are
tight.

Then, we compare the hadronic gamma-ray luminosities predicted by the model for

significant (~3 sigma) signals at the positions of NGC 4151 and NGC 4258. The
derived upper limits for the flux above 1 GeV allow us to constrain the proton
acceleration efficiency in flows with heating of electrons dominated by Coulomb
interactions, which case is favored by X-ray spectral properties. In such
flows, at most ~10% of the accretion power can be used for a relativistic
acceleration of protons. Upper limits for the flux below 1 GeV can constrain

margination in blood flow at $\approx 37\%$ tube haematocrit is investigated.
The system is modelled as three-dimensional suspension of deformable red blood
cells and nearly rigid platelets using a combination of the lattice-Boltzmann,
immersed boundary and finite element methods. Results show that margination is
facilitated by a non-diffusive radial platelet transport. This effect is
important near the edge of the cell-free layer, but it is only observed for $Ca
> 0.2$, when red blood cells are tank-treading rather than tumbling. It is also
shown that platelet trapping in the cell-free layer is reversible for $Ca \leq
0.2$. Only for the smallest investigated tube ($D = 10 \mu\text{m}$)
margination is essentially independent of $Ca$. Once platelets have reached the
cell-free layer, they tend to slide rather than tumble. The tumbling rate is
essentially independent of $Ca$ but increases with $D$. Tumbling is suppressed
by the strong confinement due to the relatively small cell-free layer thickness
at $\approx 37\%$ tube haematocrit.

to reveal the flavor structure of the Standard Model (SM). A lot of efforts
have been put into the model building and we find many kinds of flavor
symmetries and setups are able to explain the observed fermion mass matrices.
In this paper, we look for common predictions of physical observables among the
ones in flavor symmetric models, and try to understand how to test flavor
symmetry in experiments. Especially, we focus on the BSMs for leptons with
extra Higgs $SU(2)_L$ doublets charged under flavor symmetry. In many flavor
models for leptons, remnant symmetry is partially respected after the flavor
symmetry breaking, and it controls well the Flavor Changing Neutral Currents
(FCNCs) and suggests some crucial predictions against the flavor changing
process, although the remnant symmetry is not respected in the full lagrangian.
In fact, we see that $\tau^- \to e^+ \mu^- \mu^-$ $( \mu^+ e^- e^-)$ and $e^+
e^- \to \tau^+\tau^-$ $(\mu^-\mu^+)$ processes are the most important in the
flavor models that the extra Higgs doublets belong to triplet representation of
flavor symmetry. For instance, the stringent constraint from the $\mu \to e
\gamma$ process could be evaded according to the partial remnant symmetry. We
also investigate the breaking effect of the remnant symmetry mediated by the
Higgs scalars, and investigate the constraints from the flavor physics: the
flavor violating $\tau$ and $\mu$ decays, the electric dipole moments, and the
muon anomalous magnetic moment. We also discuss the correlation between FCNCs
and nonzero $\theta_{13}$, and point out the physical observables in the
charged lepton sector to test the BSMs for the neutrino mixing.

  Aims. We aim to obtain the first observational proof of the expected
large-scale evolution and interaction with the environment in an astrophysical
jet. Only jets from microquasars offer a chance to witness the real-time,
full-jet evolution within a human lifetime, since they combine a 'short', few
parsec length with relativistic velocities.
  Methods. The methodology of this work is based on a systematic recalibraton
of interferometric radio observations of microquasars available in public
archives. In particular, radio observations of the microquasar GRS 1758-258
over less than two decades have provided the most striking results.
  Results. Significant morphological variations in the extended jet structure
of GRS 1758-258 are reported here that were previously missed. Its northern
radio lobe underwent a major morphological variation that rendered the hotspot
undetectable in 2001 and reappeared again in the following years. The reported
changes confirm the Galactic nature of the source. We tentatively interpret
them in terms of the growth of instabilities in the jet flow. There is also
evidence of surrounding cocoon. These results can provide a testbed for models

hierarchy of cumulant equations is not closed. But because atmospheric flows
are inhomogeneous and anisotropic, the nonlinearity may manifest itself only
weakly through interactions of mean fields with disturbances such as thermals
or eddies. In such situations, truncations of the hierarchy of cumulant
equations hold promise as a closure strategy.
  We review how truncations at second order can be used to model and elucidate
the dynamics of atmospheric flows. Two examples are considered. First, we study
the growth of a dry convective boundary layer, which is heated from below,
leading to turbulent upward energy transport and growth of the boundary layer.
We demonstrate that a quasilinear truncation of the equations of motion, in
which interactions of disturbances among each other are neglected but
interactions with mean fields are taken into account, can capture the growth of
the convective boundary layer even if it does not capture important turbulent
transport terms. Second, we study the evolution of two-dimensional large-scale
waves representing waves in Earth's upper atmosphere. We demonstrate that a
cumulant expansion truncated at second order (CE2) can capture the evolution of
such waves and their nonlinear interaction with the mean flow in some
circumstances, for example, when the wave amplitude is small enough or the
planetary rotation rate is large enough. However, CE2 fails to capture the flow
evolution when nonlinear eddy--eddy interactions in surf zones become
important. Higher-order closures can capture these missing interactions.
  The results point to new ways in which the dynamics of turbulent boundary
layers may be represented in climate models, and they illustrate different
classes of nonlinear processes that can control wave dissipation and momentum
fluxes in the troposphere.

Then we point out that for flat backgrounds the pure $R^2$ theory propagates
only a scalar massless mode and no spin-two tensor mode. However, the latter
emerges either by expanding the theory around curved backgrounds like de Sitter
or anti-de Sitter, or by changing the long-distance dynamics by introducing the
standard Einstein term. In both cases, the theory is modified in the infrared
and a propagating graviton is recovered. Hence we recognize a subtle interplay
between the UV and IR properties of higher order gravity. We also calculate the
corresponding Newton's law for general quadratic curvature theories. Finally,
we discuss how quadratic actions may be obtained from a fundamental theory like
string- or M-theory. We demonstrate that string theory on non-compact $CY_3$

allows to study the hyperbolic limit of a kinetic chemotaxis model. Moreover,
we propose a finite volume numerical scheme whose convergence towards

capturing the behaviour after blow up. Finally, numerical simulations
illustrate the complex dynamics of aggregates until the formation of a single

accurately predicts percolation thresholds for aspect ratios as low as 10. The
percolation threshold for rod-like particles of aspect ratios below 1000
deviates significantly from the inverse aspect ratio scaling prediction,
thought to be valid in the limit of infinitely slender rods and often used as a
rule of thumb for nano-fibers in composite materials. Hence, most fibers that
are currently used as fillers in composite materials cannot be regarded as
practically infinitely slender for the purposes of percolation theory.
Comparing percolation thresholds of hard rods and new benchmark results for

reliability: short-term prediction of electrical grid failures (""manhole

cause threats to public safety and reliability of electrical service in cities.
RPPs incorporate self-exciting, self-regulating and saturating components. The
self-excitement occurs as a result of a past event, which causes a temporary
rise in vulner ability to future events. The self-regulation occurs as a result
of an external inspection which temporarily lowers vulnerability to future
events. RPPs can saturate when too many events or inspections occur close
together, which ensures that the probability of an event stays within a
realistic range. Two of the operational challenges for power companies are (i)
making continuous-time failure predictions, and (ii) cost/benefit analysis for
decision making and proactive maintenance. RPPs are naturally suited for
handling both of these challenges. We use the model to predict power-grid
failures in Manhattan over a short-term horizon, and to provide a cost/benefit
analysis of different proactive maintenance programs.

Loday's realization of the associahedron, and J.-L. Loday and M. Ronco's Hopf
algebra on binary trees. We show that these constructions extend in the world
of acyclic $k$-triangulations, which were already considered as the vertices of
V. Pilaud and F. Santos' brick polytopes. We describe combinatorially a natural
surjection from the permutations to the acyclic $k$-triangulations. We show
that the fibers of this surjection are the classes of the congruence $\equiv^k$

$a < b_1, \dots, b_k < c$ and words $U, V_1, \dots, V_k, W$ on $[n]$. We then
show that the increasing flip order on $k$-triangulations is the lattice
quotient of the weak order by this congruence. Moreover, we use this surjection
to define a Hopf subalgebra of C. Malvenuto and C. Reutenauer's Hopf algebra on
permutations, indexed by acyclic $k$-triangulations, and to describe the
product and coproduct in this algebra and its dual in term of combinatorial
operations on acyclic $k$-triangulations. Finally, we extend our results in
three directions, describing a Cambrian, a tuple, and a Schr\""oder version of

mixing between axions, and if some of the axions acquire a non-zero mass
through non-perturbative effects as the corresponding gauge interactions become
strong. The axion potential changes significantly during the level crossing,
which affects the axion dynamics in various ways. We find that, if there is a
mild hierarchy in the decay constants, the axion starts to run along the valley
of the potential, passing through many crests and troughs, until it gets
trapped in one of the minima; the {\it axion roulette}. The axion dynamics
exhibits a chaotic behavior during the oscillations, and which minimum the
axion is finally stabilized is highly sensitive to the initial misalignment
angle. Therefore, the axion roulette is considered to be accompanied by domain
wall formation. The cosmological domain wall problem can be avoided by
introducing a small bias between the vacua. We discuss cosmological
implications of the domain wall annihilation for baryogenesis and future
gravitational wave experiments.

compelling, given the current limited galaxy age-$z$ sample. We carry out Monte
Carlo simulations based on these current age measurements to estimate how large

99.7\%$ confidence level. We find that if the real cosmology is $\Lambda$CDM, a
sample of $\sim 45$ galaxy ages would be sufficient to rule out $R_{\rm h}=ct$

local image statistics is roughly stationary within a small neighborhood but

first applied the parametric texture algorithm of Portilla and Simoncelli to
image patches of 64X64 pixels in a large database of natural images such that
each image patch is then described by 655 texture parameters which specify
certain statistics, such as variances and covariances of wavelet coefficients

  To model the statistics of these texture parameters, we then developed
suitable nonlinear transformations of the parameters that allowed us to fit
their joint statistics with a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We find that
the first 200 principal components contain more than 99% of the variance and
are sufficient to generate textures that are perceptually extremely close to
those generated with all 655 components. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
model in several ways: (1) We sample ensembles of texture patches that can be
directly compared to samples of patches from the natural image database and can
to a high degree reproduce their perceptual appearance. (2) We further
developed an image compression algorithm which generates surprisingly accurate
images at bit rates as low as 0.14 bits/pixel. Finally, (3) We demonstrate how

able to obtain the full posterior probability distribution for the lens light,
the mass distribution and the background source at the same time. Lensed is
first tested on mock images which reproduce realistic space-based observations

bitmap, ignoring some vital domain-specific information that may be useful but
that cannot be learnt by traditional networks. In this paper, we propose an
enhancement of the DCNN approach to online HCCR by incorporating a variety of
domain-specific knowledge, including deformation, non-linear normalization,
imaginary strokes, path signature, and 8-directional features. Our contribution
is twofold. First, these domain-specific technologies are investigated and
integrated with a DCNN to form a composite network to achieve improved
performance. Second, the resulting DCNNs with diversity in their domain
knowledge are combined using a hybrid serial-parallel (HSP) strategy.
Consequently, we achieve a promising accuracy of 97.20% and 96.87% on

bars within the theoretical uncertainties associated to the spherical

hypernuclei on the $N-Y$ and $Y-Y$ channels, we limit ourselves to purely
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei, to magic numbers of $\Lambda$'s (for Z $\leq$ 120 and
$\Lambda \leq$70), and to even-even-even systems. We consider a density
functional approach adjusted to microscopic Bruckner-Hartree-Fock calculations,
where the $\Lambda\Lambda$ term is corrected in a phenomenological way, to
reproduce present experimental constraints. The number of bound even-even-even
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei is estimated to 491680 $\pm$ 34400. This relatively low

tunneling between a single self-assembled quantum dot (QD) and an electron
reservoir. In equilibrium, the RF intensity reflects the average electron
occupation of the QD and exhibits a gate voltage dependence that is given by
the Fermi distribution in the reservoir. In the time-resolved signal, however,
we find that the relaxation rate for electron tunneling is independent of the
occupation in the charge reservoir. Using a master equation approach which
includes both the electron tunneling and the optical excitation/recombination,
we are able to explain the experimental data by optical blocking, i. e. a
reduced electron tunneling rate when the QD is occupied by an exciton.

This theory is based on the method of separation of variables and the
application of an addition theorem for cylindrical functions. The purpose of
this tutorial is to assemble the practical tools necessary to implement the
2D-GLMT method for the computation of scattering by passive scatterers or of
resonances in optically active media. The first part contains a derivation of
the vector and scalar Helmholtz equations for 2D geometries, starting from
Maxwell's equations. Optically active media are included in 2D-GLMT using a
recent stationary formulation of the Maxwell-Bloch equations called
steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT), which introduces new classes of
solutions useful for resonance computations. Following these preliminaries, a
detailed description of 2D-GLMT is presented. The emphasis is placed on the
derivation of beam-shape coefficients for scattering computations, as well as
the computation of resonant modes using a combination of 2D-GLMT and SALT. The
final section contains several numerical examples illustrating the full

thermal dust emission and molecular emission lines. In the case of high
mass-loss rates, this study is complicated by the high optical depths and the
intricate coupling between gas and dust radiative transfer characteristics. An
important aspect of the physics of gas-dust interactions is the strong
influence of dust on the excitation of several molecules, including H2O. Aims:
The dust and gas content of the envelope surrounding the high mass-loss rate
OH/IR star OH 127.8+0.0, as traced by Herschel observations, is studied, with a
focus on the H2O content and the dust-to-gas ratio. We report detecting a large
number of H2O vapor emission lines up to J = 9 in the Herschel data, for which
we present the measured line strengths. Methods: The treatments of both gas and
dust species are combined using two numerical radiative transfer codes. The
method is illustrated for both low and high mass-loss-rate sources.
Specifically, we discuss different ways of assessing the dust-to-gas ratio: 1)
from the dust thermal emission spectrum and the CO molecular gas line
strengths; 2) from the momentum transfer from dust to gas and the measured gas
terminal velocity; and 3) from the determination of the required amount of dust
to reproduce H2O lines for a given H2O vapor abundance. These three diagnostics
probe different zones of the outflow, for the first time allowing an
investigation of a possible radial dependence of the dust-to-gas ratio.

studied by investigating the large momentum limit of the hadronic matrix
elements of spacelike correlators, which are known as quasi parton
distributions. Like a light-cone parton distribution, a quasi parton
distribution also contains ultraviolet divergences and therefore needs
renormalization. The renormalization of non-local operators in general is not
well understood. However, in the case of quasi quark distribution, the bilinear
quark operator with a straight-line gauge link appears to be multiplicatively
renormalizable by the quark wave function renormalization in the axial gauge.
We first show that the renormalization of the self energy correction to the
quasi quark distribution is equivalent to that of the heavy-light quark vector
current in heavy quark effective theory at one-loop order. Assuming this
equivalence at two-loop order, we then show that the multiplicative
renormalizability of the quasi quark distribution is true at two-loop order.

that between 110K and 130K, H2O grows as highly commensurate well ordered
islands which only partially wet the gold surface. The islands produce a clear
(sqrt3Xsqrt3)R30 diffraction pattern and are characterized by a well defined
height of ~ 5 Angstrom with respect to the surface gold atoms. These findings
provide support for a unique double bilayer model which has recently been

doubling the leverage of the current SN Ia NIR Hubble diagram and the number of
SNe beyond redshift 0.04. This sample was analyzed together with 102 NIR and
458 optical light curves (LCs) of normal SNe Ia from the literature. The
analysis of 45 well-sampled NIR LCs shows that a single template accurately
describes them if its time axis is stretched with the optical stretch
parameter. This allows us to estimate the NIR peak magnitudes even with one
observation obtained within 10 days from B-band maximum. We find that the NIR
Hubble residuals show weak correlation with DM_15 and E(B-V), and for the first

NIR luminosity scatter of SNe Ia is estimated to be around 0.10 mag, which is
smaller than what can be derived for a similarly heterogeneous sample at

standard candles in the NIR as in the optical. We showed that it is feasible to
extended the NIR SN Ia Hubble diagram to z=0.2 with very modest sampling of the

transfer simulations in a general 3D geometry. The algorithms behind and
acceleration techniques for Monte Carlo radiative transfer are discussed
extensively in the literature, and many different Monte Carlo codes are
publicly available. On the contrary, the design of a suite of components that
can be used for the distribution of sources and sinks in radiative transfer
codes has received very little attention. The availability of such models, with
different degrees of complexity, has many benefits. For example, they can serve
as toy models to test new physical ingredients, or as parameterised models for
inverse radiative transfer fitting. For 3D Monte Carlo codes, this requires
algorithms to efficiently generate random positions from 3D density
distributions. We describe the design of a flexible suite of components for the
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. The design is based on a combination
of basic building blocks (which can be either analytical toy models or
numerical models defined on grids or a set of particles) and the extensive use
of decorators that combine and alter these building blocks to more complex
structures. For a number of decorators, e.g. those that add spiral structure or
clumpiness, we provide a detailed description of the algorithms that can be
used to generate random positions. Advantages of this decorator-based design
include code transparency, the avoidance of code duplication, and an increase
in code maintainability. Moreover, since decorators can be chained without
problems, very complex models can easily be constructed out of simple building
blocks. Finally, based on a number of test simulations, we demonstrate that our
design using customised random position generators is superior to a simpler
design based on a generic black-box random position generator.

presence of ozone can significantly influence the thermal structure of an

that ozone can form in carbon dioxide-rich atmospheres. We investigate the
effect of ozone on the temperature structure of simulated early Martian
atmospheres. With a 1D radiative-convective model, we calculate
temperature-pressure profiles for a 1 bar carbon dioxide atmosphere. Ozone
profiles are fixed, parameterized profiles. We vary the location of the ozone
layer maximum and the concentration at this maximum. The maximum is placed at
different pressure levels in the upper and middle atmosphere (1-10 mbar).
Results suggest that the impact of ozone on surface temperatures is relatively
small. However, the planetary albedo significantly decreases at large ozone
concentrations. Throughout the middle and upper atmospheres, temperatures
increase upon introducing ozone due to strong UV absorption. This heating of
the middle atmosphere strongly reduces the zone of carbon dioxide condensation,
hence the potential formation of carbon dioxide clouds. For high ozone
concentrations, the formation of carbon dioxide clouds is inhibited in the
entire atmosphere. In addition, due to the heating of the middle atmosphere,
the cold trap is located at increasingly higher pressures when increasing
ozone. This leads to wetter stratospheres hence might increase water loss rates
on early Mars. However, increased stratospheric H2O would lead to more HOx,
which could efficiently destroy ozone. This result emphasizes the need for
consistent climate-chemistry calculations to assess the feedback between
temperature structure, water content and ozone chemistry. Furthermore,
convection is inhibited at high ozone amounts, leading to a stably stratified
atmosphere.

  rewording",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we show that the spatio-temporal evolution of incompressible
flows in a long circular pipe can be described by vorticity dynamics. The
principal techniques to obtain solutions are similar to those used for flows in
the whole space. As the consideration of the Navier-Stokes equations is given
in a cylindrical co-ordinates system, two aspects of complication arise. One is
the interaction of the velocity components in the radial and azimuthal
directions, due to the fictitious centrifugal force in the equations of motion.
The rate of the vorticity production at the pipe wall depends on the initial
data at entry, and hence is unknown a priori; it must be determined as part of
the solution. The vorticity solution obtained defines an intricate flow-field
of multitudinous degrees of freedom. As the Reynolds number increases, the
analytical solution predicts vorticity-scale proliferations in succession. For
sufficiently large initial data, pipe flows are of a turbulent nature. The
solution of the governing equations is globally regular and does not bifurcate
in space or in time. It is asserted that laminar-turbulent transition is a
dynamic process inbred in the non-linearity. The presence of exogenous
disturbances, due to imperfect test environments or purpose-made artificial
forcing, distorts the course of the intrinsic transition. The flow structures

K-user multiple access channel (MAC), with or without feedback. Using high-SNR
asymptotics, the work first derives bounds on the computational resources
required to achieve near-optimal (ML-based) decoding performance. It then
bounds the (reduced) complexity needed to achieve any (including suboptimal)
diversity-multiplexing performance tradeoff (DMT) performance, and finally
bounds the same complexity, in the presence of feedback-aided user selection.
This latter effort reveals the ability of a few bits of feedback not only to
improve performance, but also to reduce complexity. In this context, the
analysis reveals the interesting finding that proper calibration of user
selection can allow for near-optimal ML-based decoding, with complexity that
need not scale exponentially in the total number of codeword bits. The derived
bounds constitute the best known performance-vs-complexity behavior to date for
ML-based MAC decoding, as well as a first exploration of the
complexity-feedback-performance interdependencies in multiuser settings.

to the magnetization. Each of them surrounds a single Weyl point, leading to
Chern numbers of $\pm 1$. These small topological pockets contribute a sizable

the depth of the cavity as traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and
evidence for near free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical
models for disk tearing, which could be driven by the reported low mass
companion, whose orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The
companion's high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive
Kozai oscillations over long time-scales; high-eccentricity periods may perhaps
account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk could imprint

operation, i.e. the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x)

axial-vector nature. As a consequence, the left-handed truly neutral neutrino
in an axial-vector field of emission can be converted into a right-handed one
and vice versa. This predicts the unidenticality of masses, energies and
momenta of neutrinos of the different components. Recognizing such a difference
in masses, energies, momenta and accepting that the left-handed axial-vector
neutrino and the right-handed antineutrino of true neutrality refer to
long-lived C-odd leptons, and the right-handed truly neutral neutrino and the
left-handed axial-vector antineutrino are of short-lived fermions of C-oddity,
we would write a new CP-even Dirac equation taking into account the flavor
symmetrical axial-vector mass, energy and momentum matrices. Their presence
explains the spontaneous mirror symmetry violation, confirming that an
axial-vector current conservation law has never violated. They reflect the
availability of a mirror Minkowski space in which a neutrino is characterized
by left as well as by right space-time coordinates. Therefore, it is not
surprising that whatever the main purposes experiments about a quasielastic
axial-vector mass say in favor of an axial-vector mirror Minkowski space-time.

field have been computed approximately. It is obtained a transcendental
function of energy, $\mathcal{F}(E)$, by writing in terms of confluent Heun
functions. The numerical values of energy are then obtained by fixing the zeros
on ""$E$-axis"" for both complex functions $Re[\mathcal{F}(E)]$ and
$Im[\mathcal{F}(E)]$.
