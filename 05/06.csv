the brightest radio sources in the sky and a unique laboratory for supernova
physics. Although its compact remnant was discovered in 1999 by the Chandra
X-Ray Observatory, nowadays it is widely accepted that a neutron star lies in
the center of this supernova remnant. In addition, new observations suggest
that such neutron star with a low magnetic field and evidence of a carbon
atmosphere could have suffered a hypercritical accretion phase seconds after
the explosion. Considering this hypercritical accretion episode, we compute the
neutrino cooling effect, the number of events and neutrino flavor ratios
expected on Hyper-Kamiokande Experiment. The neutrino cooling effect (the
emissivity and luminosity of neutrinos) is obtained through numerical
simulations performed in a customized version of the FLASH code. Based on these
simulations, we forecast that the number of events expected on the
Hyper-Kamiokande Experiment is around 3195. Similarly, we estimate the neutrino
flavor ratios to be detected considering the neutrino effective potential due
to the thermal and magnetized plasma and thanks to the envelope of the star. It
is worth noting that our estimates correspond to the only trustworthy method
for verifying the hypercritical phase and although this episode took place 330
years ago, at present supernova remnants with these similarities might occur
thus confirming our predictions for this phase.

the spontaneous signal. The stimulation enhancement is greatest in situations
where spontaneous signals are the weakest - such as low laser power, small
sample volume, and weak nonlinear susceptibility - emphasizing the potential
for this technique to improve signal-to-noise ratios in biological imaging and

the ""pole-dipole"" approximation, as described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon
(MPD) equations, and examine its properties in dependence on the spin
supplementary condition added to close the system. The MPD equation of motion
is decomposed in the orthonormal tetrad whose time vector is given by the
four-velocity $V^\mu$ chosen to fix the spin condition (the ""reference
observer"") and the first spatial vector by the corresponding spin; such
projections do not contain the Weyl scalars $\Psi_0$ and $\Psi_4$ obtained in
the associated Newman-Penrose (NP) null tetrad. One natural choice of the
remaining two spatial basis vectors is shown to follow ""intrinsically""; it is
realizable if the particle's four-velocity and four-momentum are not parallel.
To see how the problem depends on the curvature type, one first identifies the
first vector of the NP tetrad $k^\mu$ with the highest-multiplicity principal
null direction of the Weyl tensor, and then sets $V^\mu$ so that $k^\mu$ belong
to the spin-bivector eigenplane. In spacetimes of any algebraic type but III,
it is possible to rotate the tetrads so as to become ""transverse"", namely so
that $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_3$ vanish. If the spin-bivector eigenplane could be
made coincide with the real-vector plane of any of such transverse frames, the
motion would consequently be fully determined by $\Psi_2$ and the cosmological
constant; however, this can be managed in exceptional cases only. Besides
focusing on specific Petrov types, we derive several sets of useful relations
valid generally and check whether/how the exercise simplifies for some specific
types of motion. The particular option of having four-velocity parallel to
four-momentum is advocated and a natural resolution of nonuniqueness of the
corresponding reference observer $V^\mu$ is suggested.

content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom, n_eff. These
measurements allow for a tight test of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data
alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our
BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light
elements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of the
primordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations
are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions, and are
consistent with the Standard Model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H
now provides a tight measurement of N_nu when combined with the CMB baryon
density, and provides a 2sigma upper limit N_nu < 3.2. The new precision of the
CMB and of D/H observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest
source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore
rely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and he4, li7
predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new
physics.

discovered by the La Silla QUEST survey and classified by the Public ESO
Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects. The spectrum and light curve are
very similar to slow-declining SLSNe such as PTF12dam. However, detections
within ~1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak,
lasting for ~15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light. The
broader, main peak can be fit with either central engine or circumstellar
interaction models. We discuss the implications of the precursor peak in the
context of these models. It is too bright and narrow to be explained as a
normal 56Ni-powered SN, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle to
fit the two peaks simultaneously. We propose that the initial peak may arise
from the post-shock cooling of extended stellar material, and reheating by a
central engine drives the second peak. In this picture, we show that an
explosion energy of ~2x10^{52} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundred
solar radii would be required to power the early emission. The competing engine
models involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-back
accretion onto a central black hole. The prompt energy required may favour the
black hole scenario. The bright initial peak effectively rules out a compact
Wolf-Rayet star as a progenitor, since the inferred energies and ejected masses
become unphysical.

standard quantum limit (SQL) due to the uncertainty principle. The latest proof
of the SQL is analyzed to revleal an unsupported assumption on quantum
measurements. Quantum measurement theory is introduced to give a general
criterion for physically realizable measurements in quantum mechanics. A theory
of approximate position measurements is developed to obtain a rigorous
condition for the SQL and also to show that a precise position measurement can
leave the object in an arbitrary family of states independent of the input
state. This concludes that Yuen's proposal of breaking the SQL by a contractive
state measurement, a measurement of the position leaving the free mass in a
state with the position uncertainty decreasing in time, is physically
realizable in principle. To enforce this conclusion, a model for error-free
position measurement that leaves the object in a contractive state is
constructed with a solvable Hamiltonian for measuring interaction. Finally,
this model is shown to break the SQL with arbitrary accuracy.

disk wind by which gas materials are lost from the surface of a protoplanetary
disk, which can significantly alter the evolution of the inner disk and the
formation of terrestrial planets. A simultaneous description of the realistic
evolution of the gaseous and solid components in a disk may provide a clue for
solving the problem of the mass concentration of the terrestrial planets in the
solar system. We simulate the formation of terrestrial planets from planetary
embryos in a disk that evolves via magnetorotational instability and a disk
wind. The aim is to examine the effects of a disk wind on the orbital evolution
and final configuration of planetary systems. We perform N-body simulations of
sixty 0.1 Earth-mass embryos in an evolving disk. The evolution of the gas
surface density of the disk is tracked by solving a one-dimensional diffusion
equation with a sink term that accounts for the disk wind. We find that even in
the case of a weak disk wind, the radial slope of the gas surface density of
the inner disk becomes shallower, which slows or halts the type I migration of
embryos. If the effect of the disk wind is strong, the disk profile is
significantly altered (e.g., positive surface density gradient, inside-out
evacuation), leading to outward migration of embryos inside ~ 1 AU. Disk winds
play an essential role in terrestrial planet formation inside a few AU by
changing the disk profile. In addition, embryos can undergo convergent
migration to ~ 1 AU in certainly probable conditions. In such a case, the
characteristic features of the solar system's terrestrial planets (e.g., mass
concentration around 1 AU, late giant impact) may be reproduced.

TDEs represent a new probe of matter under strong gravity, and have opened up a
new window into studying accretion physics under extreme conditions. The events
probe relativistic effects, provide a new means of measuring black hole spin,
and represent signposts of intermediate-mass BHs, binary BHs and recoiling BHs.
Luminous, high-amplitude X-ray flares, matching key predictions of the tidal

with other missions and in other wavebands. The Swift discovery of two

unique probe of the early phases of jet formation and evolution, and
SwiftJ1644+75 has the best covered lightcurve of any TDE to date. Further,
Swift has made important contributions in providing well-covered lightcurves of
TDEs discovered with other instruments, setting constraints on the physics that
govern the TDE evolution, and including the discovery of the first candidate

known for more than 40 years that ordinary categories themselves in general do
not permit such completions. Armed with this new semantical view of

the empirical or strong notions of coordination, we define and use a notion of
set coordination. This notion of coordination bears similarities with the
empirical notion of coordination. We observe that set coordination, in its
special case of two nodes with a one-way communication link is equivalent with
the ""Hide and Seek"" source coding problem of McEliece and Posner. The Hide and
Seek problem has known intimate connections with graph entropy, rate distortion
theory, Renyi mutual information and even error exponents. Other special cases
of the set coordination problem relate to Witsenhausen's zero error rate and
the distributed computation problem. These connections motivate a better
understanding of set coordination, its connections with empirical coordination,
and its study in more general setups. This paper takes a first step in this

density (N-pdf). It gives expressions for the column density and mass profiles

central concentration of this characteristic filament can distinguish regions
and can quantify their fertility for star formation. Profiles are calculated
for N-pdfs which are pure lognormal, pure power law, or a combination. In
relation to models of singular polytropic cylinders, characteristic filaments
can be unbound, bound, or collapsing depending on their central concentration.
Such filamentary models of the dynamical state of N-pdf gas are more relevant
to star-forming regions than are models of spherical collapse. The star
formation fertility of a bound or collapsing filament is quantified by its mean
mass accretion rate when in radial free fall. For a given mass per length, the
fertility increases with the filament mean column density and with its initial
concentration. In selected regions the fertility of their characteristic
filaments increases with the level of star formation.

experiments. Molecular simulations of ice nucleation are also challenging, and
direct rate calculations have only been performed for coarse-grained models of
wate. For molecular models, only indirect estimates have been obtained, e.g. by
assuming the validity of classical nucleation theory. We use a path sampling
approach to perform the first direct rate calculation of homogeneous nucleation
of ice in a molecular model of water. We use TIP4P/Ice, the most accurate among
existing molecular models for studying ice polymorphs. By using a novel
topological approach to distinguish different polymorphs, we are able to
identify a freezing mechanism that involves a competition between cubic and
hexagonal ice in the early stages of nucleation. In this competition, the cubic
polymorph takes over since the addition of new topological structural motifs
consistent with cubic ice leads to the formation of more compact crystallites.
This is not true for topological hexagonal motifs, which give rise to elongated
crystallites that are not able to grow. This leads to transition states that
are rich in cubic ice, and not the thermodynamically stable hexagonal
polymorph. This mechanism provides a molecular explanation to the earlier
experimental and computational observations of the preference for cubic ice in
the literature.

=^infty, notion of infinitary equational reasoning, and ->^infty, the standard
notion of infinitary rewriting as follows:

  ->^infty := mu R. nu S. ( ->_root + lift(R) )^* ; lift(S)

neither the need for ordinals nor for metric convergence. This makes the

The analysis serves as a generic benchmark for the reconstruction of highly

showing a high degree of robustness towards beam-induced background while
preserving the features typically found in algorithms developed for e+e-

Comparison of Planck and CARMA-8 measurements showed good agreement in Y_{500}

Furthermore, Compton-thick (CT) absorbers (NH>10^24 cm^-2) suppress even the
hard X-ray (2-10 keV) AGN nuclear emission, and therefore the column density
distribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. We present the
identification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (NH>~10^25
cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (L(2-10keV)>10^44 erg s^-1) AGN at z=0.353 in
the COSMOS field. Several independent indicators, such as the shape of the
X-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution and
X-ray/[NeV] and X-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that the
nuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. The host
galaxy properties show that this highly obscured AGN is hosted in a massive
star-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlate
with the presence of CT absorbers. Finally, asymmetric and blueshifted
components in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate the
presence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense AGN activity
(L(Bol)/L(Edd) = 0.3-0.5). Such highly obscured, highly accreting AGN are
intrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be much
more common at the peak of the star formation and BH accretion history, at

formation via gravitational instabilities (GI) in 3D with the block-structured
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamics code ENZO. With this setup, we
explore the impact of AMR techniques on the fragmentation and clumping due to
large-scale instabilities using different AMR configurations. Additionally, we
seek to derive general resolution criteria for global simulations of
self-gravitating disks of variable extent. We run a grid of simulations with
varying AMR settings, including runs with a static grid for comparison, and
study the effects of varying the disk radius. Adopting a marginally stable disk
profile (Q_init=1), we validate the numerical robustness of our model for
different spatial extensions, from compact to larger, extended disks (R_disk =
10, 100 and 300 AU, M_disk ~ 0.05 M_Sun, M_star = 0.646 M_Sun). By combining
our findings from the resolution and parameter studies we find a lower limit of
the resolution to be able to resolve GI induced fragmentation features and
distinct, turbulence inducing clumps. Irrespective of the physical extension of
the disk, topologically disconnected clump features are only resolved if the
fragmentation-active zone of the disk is resolved with at least 100 cells,
which holds as a minimum requirement for all global disk setups. Our
simulations illustrate the capabilities of AMR-based modeling techniques for
planet formation simulations and underline the importance of balanced
refinement settings to reproduce fragmenting structures.

observables, such as the radial surface brightness and second-order velocity
moment profiles, are subject to short-term variations due to individual
episodes of matter infall and/or star formation. The total mass, energy and
angular momentum, on the other hand, are approximately conserved. Thus, the
total energy and angular momentum more directly probe the formation of galaxies
and their nuclear star clusters, by offering access to more fundamental
properties of the nuclear cluster-galaxy system than traditional observables.
We find that there is a strong correlation, in fact a near equality, between
the root-mean-square velocity of a nuclear star cluster and that of its host.
Thus, the energy per unit mass of a nuclear star cluster is always comparable
to that of its host galaxy. We interpret this as evidence that nuclear star
clusters do not form independently of their host galaxies, but rather that
their formation and subsequent evolution are coupled. We discuss how our

that models in which the bulk of massive E-S0's have evolved passively since

adjusting the Kr$^+$--Kr$^{3+}$ photoionization cross sections within their
cited uncertainties and the dielectronic recombination rate coefficients by
slightly larger amounts. From grids of models spanning the physical conditions
encountered in PNe, we derive new, broadly applicable ionization correction
factor (ICF) formulae for calculating Se and Kr elemental abundances. The ICFs
were applied to our previous survey of near-infrared [Kr III] and [Se IV]

variations are accompained with variations of the nuclear continuum. At UV
frequencies nuclear variations are nor found. We report for the first time two

early Universe. Recently, we have pointed out that a flat direction may have a
positive Hubble induced mass term during inflation whereas a negative one after
inflation. In this case, the flat direction stays at the origin of the
potential during inflation and then obtain a large vacuum expectation value
after inflation. After that, when the Hubble parameter decreases down to the
mass of the flat direction, it starts to oscillate around the origin of the
potential. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the flat direction
with and without higher dimensional superpotentials and show that topological

provide a powerful probe to test the gravity theory on large scales. However,
to extract unbiased physical constraints, the clustering pattern has to be
modelled accurately, taking into account the effects of non-linear dynamics at
small scales, and properly describing the link between the selected cosmic
tracers and the underlying dark matter field. We use a large hydrodynamic
simulation to investigate how the systematic error on the linear growth rate,
$f$, caused by model uncertainties, depends on sample selections and comoving
scales. Specifically, we measure the redshift-space two-point correlation
function of mock samples of galaxies, galaxy clusters and Active Galactic
Nuclei, extracted from the Magneticum simulation, in the redshift range 0.2 < z
< 2, and adopting different sample selections. We estimate $f\sigma_8$ by
modelling both the monopole and the full two-dimensional anisotropic
clustering, using the dispersion model. We find that the systematic error on
$f\sigma_8$ depends significantly on the range of scales considered for the
fit. If the latter is kept fixed, the error depends on both redshift and sample
selection, due to the scale-dependent impact of non-linearities, if not
properly modelled. On the other hand, we show that it is possible to get
unbiased constraints on $f\sigma_8$ provided that the analysis is restricted to
a proper range of scales, that depends non trivially on the properties of the
sample. This can have a strong impact on multiple tracers analyses, and when

precision and this affects the measurement of environment. We study this by
measuring environments using SDSS spectroscopic and photometric redshifts and
also simulated photometric redshifts with a range of uncertainties. We consider
the Nth nearest neighbour and fixed aperture methods and evaluate the impact of
the aperture parameters and the redshift uncertainty. We find that photometric
environments have a smaller dynamic range than spectroscopic measurements
because uncertain redshifts scatter galaxies from dense environments into less
dense environments. At the expected redshift uncertainty of DES, 0.1, there is
Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.4 between the measurements using the
optimal parameters. We examine the galaxy red fraction as a function of mass
and environment using photometric redshifts and find that the bivariate
dependence is still present in the SDSS photometric measurements. We show that
photometric samples with a redshift uncertainty of 0.1 must be approximately

efficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy
between the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map
for the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods
to learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in
order to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our
methods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per
second in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image
segmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft
COCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate
high-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In
particular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which
contain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,
and/or very small salient objects.

more than a million K, more than 100 times hotter that solar surface. How this
gas is heated is a fundamental question tightly interwoven with the structure
of the magnetic field in the upper atmosphere. Conducting numerical experiments
based on magnetohydrodynamics we account for both the evolving
three-dimensional structure of the atmosphere and the complex interaction of
magnetic field and plasma. Together this defines the formation and evolution of
coronal loops, the basic building block prominently seen in X-rays and extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) images. The structures seen as coronal loops in the EUV can
evolve quite differently from the magnetic field. While the magnetic field
continuously expands as new magnetic flux emerges through the solar surface,
the plasma gets heated on successively emerging fieldlines creating an EUV loop
that remains roughly at the same place. For each snapshot the EUV images
outline the magnetic field, but in contrast to the traditional view, the
temporal evolution of the magnetic field and the EUV loops can be different.
Through this we show that the thermal and the magnetic evolution in the outer
atmosphere of a cool star has to be treated together, and cannot be simply
separated as done mostly so far.

algorithms to search a large number of genetic markers for a disease-associated
joint association with the consideration of high-order interactions, and then
uses non-parametric statistics to test the joint association. The package
includes two functions, likelihood ratio Mann-whitney (LRMW) and Tree
Assembling Mann-whitney (TAMW).We optimize the data storage and computational

that LRMW was suitable to detect interaction among a small number of genetic

The S-W reconstruction occurs on the edges and the interfaces between the

conductance is suppressed considerably if the gate voltage $V_g$ takes
intermediate values around $|V_{g}|\sim t_0$($t_0$ being the hopping amplitude

is close to the Dirac point or the band edges, the conductance is relatively
insensitive to the edge reconstruction. The effect of edge reconstruction
become less important with increasing ribbon width as expected. The S-W
reconstruction occurs also possibly at the interfaces. In this case, the
reconstruction suppresses identically the conductance in the entire range of
$V_g$ for armchair GNRs. For the zigzag GNRs, the conductance is strongly

S\'ersic law: systems with high S\'ersic index m have steep central profiles

profiles and steep outer profiles. R. Cen (2014, ApJL, 790, L24) has
conjectured that these profiles arise naturally in the standard cosmological
model with initial density fluctuations represented by a Gaussian random field
(GRF). We explore and confirm this hypothesis with N-body simulations of
dissipationless collapses in which the initial conditions are generated from
GRFs with different power spectra. The numerical results show that GRFs with
more power on small scales lead to systems with higher m. In our purely
dissipationless simulations the S\'ersic index is in the range 2<m<6.5. It
follows that systems with S\'ersic index as low as m=2 can be produced by
coherent dissipationless collapse, while high-m systems can be obtained if the
assembly history is characterized by several mergers. As expected, dissipative
processes appear to be required to obtain exponential profiles (m=1).

Accepted in AJ",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pluto's system of 5 known satellites are in a puzzling orbital configuration.
Each of the four small satellites are on low-eccentricity and low-inclination
orbits situated near a mean motion resonance with the largest satellite Charon.
The Pluto-Charon binary likely formed as a result of a giant impact and so the
simplest explanation for the small satellites is that they accreted from debris
of that collision. The Pluto-Charon binary has evolved outward since its
formation due to tidal forces, which drove them into their current doubly
synchronous state. Meanwhile, leftover debris from the formation of Charon was
not initially distant enough from Pluto-Charon to explain the orbits of the
current small satellites. The outstanding problems of the system are the
movement of debris outward and the small satellites location near mean motion
resonances with Charon.
  This work explores the dynamical behavior of collisionally interacting debris
orbiting the Pluto-Charon system. While this work specifically tests initial
disk and ring configurations designed to mimic the aftermath of the disruption
of satellites by heliocentric impactors, we generally find that collisional
interactions can help move material outwards and keep otherwise unstable
material dynamically bound to the Pluto-Charon system. These processes can
produce rings of debris whose orbits evolve rapidly due to collisional
processes, with increasing pericenters and decreasing semimajor axes. While
these rings and disks of debris eventually build satellites significantly
further out than the initial locations of a disrupted satellite, they do not
show a strong preference for building satellites in or near mean motion
resonances with Charon under a wide array of tested conditions.

(although the charge current is absent). We consider a classic resonant
mechanism of the ac absorption in insulators and adapt it to the absorption of
magnons. A strong enhancement of pumping efficiency is predicted when the
Zeeman splitting of the localized states in external magnetic field is equal to
the frequency of ferromagnetic resonance. Under this condition the absorption
of a magnon takes place within individual sites.

investigate the effect of substitutional admixing on the energy levels of band

does not appreciably effect the band gap or band edges. In contrast,
substituting Al with cations of dissimilar ionic radii has a profound impact on
the band structure. We further show that certain dopants can be used to
selectively modify only the CBM or the VBM. Specifically, Ga and In decrease
the band gap by lowering the CBM, while As and Sb decrease the band gap by
raising the VBM. These results demonstrate a powerful approach to quickly
screen the impact of dopants on the electronic structure of scintillator

the full-deautonomisation procedure, which consists in analysing non-autonomous
extensions of a given discrete system obtained by adding terms that are

justification for this approach is given through an algebro-geometric analysis.
We also introduce the notions of early and late confinement. While the former
is a confinement that may exist already for the autonomous system, the latter
corresponds to a singularity pattern longer than that of the autonomous case.
Late confinement will be shown to play an important role in the singularity
analysis of systems with non-trivial gauge freedom, for which the existence of
an undetected gauge in conjunction with a sketchy analysis, might lead to
erroneous conclusions as to their integrability. An algebro-geometric analysis

includes the effects of radiative cooling, a spatially varying magnetic field,

spin-orbit split, electron- and hole-like, Fermi surface (FS) cross-sectional
areas. Their angular dependence seems consistent with ellipsoidal FSs with
volumes suggesting a modest excess in the density of electrons with respect to
that of the holes. We show that density functional theory (DFT) calculations
fail to correctly describe the FSs of WTe$_2$. When their cross-sectional areas

imbalance between the densities of electrons and holes. We find evidence for
field-dependent Fermi surface cross-sectional areas by fitting the oscillatory
component superimposed onto the magnetoresistivity signal to several
Lifshitz-Kosevich components. We also observe a pronounced field-induced
renormalization of the effective masses. Taken together, our observations

where the network topology is directed and weighted and the nodes are
higher-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. We
investigate how the network topology, the node-system dynamics, the external
control inputs, and the inner interactions affect the controllability of a
networked system, and show that for a general networked
multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) system: 1) the controllability of the overall
network is an integrated result of the aforementioned relevant factors, which
cannot be decoupled into the controllability of individual node-systems and the
properties solely determined by the network topology, quite different from the
familiar notion of consensus or formation controllability; 2) if the network
topology is uncontrollable by external inputs, then the networked system with
identical nodes will be uncontrollable, even if it is structurally
controllable; 3) with a controllable network topology, controllability and
observability of the nodes together are necessary for the controllability of
the networked systems under some mild conditions, but nevertheless they are not
sufficient. For a networked system with single-input/single-output (SISO) LTI
nodes, we present precise necessary and sufficient conditions for the
controllability of a general network topology.

Josephson junctions where the characteristic Josephson energy is much less than
the single-island Cooper-pair charging energy, $E_\mathrm{J}\ll E_{CP}$. Such
chains are deep in the insulating state, where superconducting phase coherence
across the chain is absent, and a voltage threshold for conduction is observed
at the lowest temperatures. We find that Cooper-pair tunneling in such chains
is completely suppressed. Instead, charge transport is dominated by tunneling
of single electrons, which is very sensitive to the presence of BCS
quasiparticles on the superconducting islands of the chain. Consequently we
observe a strong parity effect, where the threshold voltage vanishes sharply at
a characteristic parity temperature $T^*$, which is significantly lower than
the the critical temperature, $T_c$. A measurable and thermally-activated
zero-bias conductance appears above $T^*$, with an activation energy equal to
the superconducting gap, confirming the role of thermally-excited
quasiparticles. Conduction below $T^*$ and above the voltage threshold occurs
via injection of single electrons/holes into the Cooper-pair insulator, forming
a non-equilibrium steady state with a significantly enhanced effective
temperature. Our results explicitly show that single-electron transport
dominates deep in the insulating state of Josephson-junction arrays. This
conduction process has mostly been ignored in previous studies of both

spectral energy distribution, for which the data of UV and X-ray observations

accretion disk. The shortest timescale and large normalized excess variance of

economies where immediate wealth exchanges are carried out, instead of
reshufflings or uni-directional movements of wealth. Such dynamics produces
wealth distributions that describe more faithfully real data at small values of
wealth. Secondly, a general probabilistic trading criterion is introduced, so
that two economic units can decide independently whether to trade or not
depending on their profit. It is found that the type of the equilibrium wealth
distribution is the same for a large class of trading criteria formulated in a
symmetrical way with respect to the two interacting units. This establishes

solutions, including inflow and outflow, to study the metallicity enrichment in
galaxies. In this framework, we assume a star formation rate which follows a
linear Schmidt law, and we present new analytical solutions for the evolution
of the metallicity (Z) in galaxies. In particular, we take into account
environmental effects including primordial and enriched gas infall, outflow,
different star formation efficiencies, and galactic fountains. The enriched
infall is included to take into account galaxy-galaxy interactions. Our main
results can be summarized as: i) when a linear Schmidt law of star formation is
assumed, the resulting time evolution of the metallicity Z is the same either
for a closed-box model or for an outflow model. ii) The mass-metallicity
relation for galaxies which suffer a chemically enriched infall, originating
from another evolved galaxy with no pre-enriched gas, is shifted down in
parallel at lower Z values, if compared the closed box model. iii) When a
galaxy suffers at the same time a primordial infall and a chemically enriched
one, the primordial infall always dominates the chemical evolution. iv) We
present new solutions for the metallicity evolution in a galaxy which suffers
galactic fountains and an enriched infall from another galaxy at the same time.
The analytical solutions presented here can be very important to study the
metallicity (oxygen), which is measured in high-redshift objects. These
solutions can be very useful: a) in the context of cosmological semi-analytical
models for galaxy formation and evolution, and b) for the study of compact
groups of galaxies.

alpha-viscosity. The efficiency of such an angular momentum transfer could be
equivalent to that of alpha-viscosity with alpha=0.01-0.08. Nevertheless,
required field is well below its equipartition value, leading to a magnetically
stable disk flow. This is essentially important in order to describe the hard
spectral state of the sources, when the flow is non/sub-Keplerian. We show in
our simpler 1.5-dimensional, vertically averaged disk model that larger the
vertical-gradient of azimuthal component of magnetic field, stronger the rate
of angular momentum transfer is, which in turn may lead to a faster rate of
outflowing matter. Finding efficient angular momentum transfer, in black hole
disks, via magnetic stresses alone is very interesting, when the generic origin

numerical effort of the HQME scheme scales linearly with the simulation time

contrast, CT-QMC is less restricted by temperature at short times, but in
general the cost of going to longer times is also exponential. After
establishing the numerical exactness of the HQME scheme, we use it to elucidate
the influence of different ways to induce transport through the impurity on the

atherosclerotic plaques (APs) in arterial endothelium. The APs in part of an
arterial wall are inhomogeneous on size and on distribution. In order to
understand this in-homogeneity, the pathology of APs is analyzed by Misrepair
mechanism, a mechanism proposed in our Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. I.
In general, development of an AP is a result of repair of injured endothelium.
Because of infusion and deposition of lipids beneath endothelial cells, the
repair has to be achieved by altered remodeling of local endothelium. Such a
repair is a Misrepair. During repair, smooth muscular cells (SMCs) are
clustered and collagen fibers are produced to the lesion of endothelium for
reconstructing an anchoring structure for endothelial cells and for forming a
barrier to isolate the lipids. II. Altered remodeling (Misrepair) makes the
local part of endothelium have increased damage-sensitivity and reduced
repair-efficiency. Thus, this part of endothelium will have increased risk for
injuries, lipid-infusion, and Misrepairs. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs
and focalized deposition of lipids result in development of a plaque. III. By a
viscous circle between lipid-infusion and endothelium-Misrepair, growing of an
AP is self-accelerating. Namely, once an AP develops, it grows in an increasing
rate with time and it does not stop growing. Within part of an arterial wall,
older APs grow faster than younger ones. The oldest and the biggest AP is the
most threatening one in narrowing local vessel lumen. Therefore, the
self-accelerated growing of an AP is a fatal factor in atherosclerosis. In
conclusion, development of APs is focalized and self-accelerating, because it
is a result of accumulation of Misrepairs of endothelium.

by cosmic reservoirs are gas dominated and contain massive star-forming clumps,
thought to form by violent gravitational instabilities in highly turbulent
gas-rich disks. However, a clump formation event has not been witnessed yet,
and it is debated whether clumps survive energetic feedback from young stars,
thus migrating inwards to form galaxy bulges. Here we report spatially resolved
spectroscopy of a bright off-nuclear emission line region in a galaxy at z =
1.987. Although this region dominates the star formation in the galaxy disk,
its stellar continuum remains undetected in deep imaging, revealing an
extremely young (age < 10 Myr) massive clump, forming through the gravitational
collapse of > 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$ of gas. Gas consumption in this young clump is
> 10 times faster than in the host galaxy, displaying high star formation
efficiency during this phase, in agreement with our hydrodynamic simulations.
The frequency of older clumps with similar masses coupled with our initial
estimate of their formation rate (~ 2.5 Gyr$^{-1}$) supports long lifetimes (~
500 Myr), favouring scenarios where clumps survive feedback and grow the bulges
of present-day galaxies.

strong CP problem in the standard model of particle physics. Coherently
generated PQ scalar fields could dominate the energy density in the early
Universe and decay into relativistic axions, which would conflict with the
current dark radiation constraints. We study the possibility that a thermal
inflation driven by a $U(1)$ gauged Higgs field dilutes such axions. A
well-motivated extra gauged $U(1)$ would be the local $B-L$ symmetry. We also
discuss the implication for the case of $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an available
baryogenesis mechanism in such cosmology.

event sequences data (also known as categorical time series) based on
three-dimensional data grid models. A data set of temporal event sequences can
be represented as a data set of three-dimensional points, each point is defined
by three variables: a sequence identifier, a time value and an event value.
Instantiating data grid models to the 3D-points turns the problem into
3D-coclustering.
  The sequences are partitioned into clusters, the time variable is discretized
into intervals and the events are partitioned into clusters. The cross-product
of the univariate partitions forms a multivariate partition of the
representation space, i.e., a grid of cells and it also represents a
nonparametric estimator of the joint distribution of the sequences, time and
events dimensions. Thus, the sequences are grouped together because they have
similar joint distribution of time and events, i.e., similar distribution of
events along the time dimension. The best data grid is computed using a
parameter-free Bayesian model selection approach. We also suggest several
criteria for exploiting the resulting grid through agglomerative hierarchies,
for interpreting the clusters of sequences and characterizing their components
through insightful visualizations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world data sets demonstrate that data grid models are efficient, effective
and discover meaningful underlying patterns of categorical time series data.

evolution of the disk composition, starting from a dense pre-stellar core
composition. We explore a range of disk temperature profiles, cosmic rays
ionization rates, and disk ages for a disk model representative of T Tauri
stars. At the high densities that prevail in disks, we find that, due to fast
reactions on grain surfaces, CO can be converted to less volatile forms
(principally s-CO$_2$, and to a lesser extent s-CH$_4$) instead of being
evaporated over a wide range of temperature. The canonical gas-phase abundance
of 10$^{-4}$ is only reached above about 30-35 K. The dominant Carbon bearing
entity depends on the temperature structure and age of the disk. The chemical
evolution of CO is also sensitive to the cosmic rays ionization rate. Larger
gas phase CO abundances are found in younger disks. Initial conditions, such as
parent cloud age and density, have a limited impact. This study reveals that CO
gas-phase abundance is heavily dependent on grain surface processes, which
remain very incompletely understood so far. The strong dependence on dust
temperature profile makes CO a poor tracer of the gas-phase content of disks.

no evidence for dose-dependence within this dose range; and more importantly,
no evidence for differences in event times between Dutch and Tanzanian study

tradeoff relations between information and disturbance. We formulate a tradeoff
relation between information and disturbance from an estimation-theoretic point

Besides covering the basic properties, we discuss many differences from the

discovered about the spectral radius; some consequences of the interlacing

show that in addition to non-negativity, the magnitude of each pixel in an

upper bound, but a much tighter upper bound can be formed from the data using
array processing techniques. This formulates image formation as a least squares
optimization problem with inequality constraints. We propose to solve this
constrained least squares problem using active set techniques, and the steps
needed to implement it are described. It is shown that the least squares part

reduced storage needs. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using

multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink channel. While conventional
beamforming schemes aim at the minimization of the transmit power subject to
suppressing interference to guarantee quality of service (QoS) constraints,
here we use the knowledge of both data and channel state information (CSI) at
the transmitter to exploit, rather than suppress, constructive interference.
More specifically, we design a new precoding scheme for the MISO downlink that
minimizes the transmit power for generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated
signals. The proposed precoder reduces the transmit power compared to
conventional schemes, by adapting the QoS constraints to accommodate
constructive interference as a source of useful signal power. By exploiting the
power of constructively interfering symbols, the proposed scheme achieves the
required QoS at lower transmit power. We extend this concept to the signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem, where higher SINR
values compared to the conventional SINR balancing optimization are achieved
for given transmit power budgets. In addition, we derive equivalent virtual
multicast formulations for both optimizations, both of which provide insights
of the optimal solution and facilitate the design of a more efficient solver.
Finally, we propose a robust beamforming technique to deal with imperfect CSI,
that also reduces the transmit power over conventional techniques, while
guaranteeing the required QoS. Our simulation and analysis show significant
power savings for small scale MISO downlink channels with the proposed
data-aided optimization compared to conventional beamforming optimization.

the entropy of macrostates for the microcanonical measure of the shallow water

the energy partition between a large scale vortical flow and small scale
fluctuations related to inertia-gravity waves. We introduce for that purpose a
discretized model of the continuous shallow water system, and compute the
corresponding statistical equilibria. We argue that microcanonical equilibrium
states of the discretized model in the continuous limit are equilibrium states
of the actual shallow water system. We show that the presence of small scale
fluctuations selects a subclass of equilibria among the states that were
previously computed by phenomenological approaches that were neglecting such
fluctuations. In the limit of weak height fluctuations, the equilibrium state
can be interpreted as two subsystems in thermal contact: one subsystem
corresponds to the large scale vortical flow, the other subsystem corresponds
to small scale height and velocity fluctuations. It is shown that either a
non-zero circulation or rotation and bottom topography are required to sustain
a non-zero large scale flow at equilibrium. Explicit computation of the
equilibria and their energy partition is presented in the quasi-geostrophic
limit for the energy-enstrophy ensemble. The possible role of small scale

established that if the clause-variable incidence graph of a CNF formula F is a

well-partial-orders with the so-called gap-condition over a finite set of
labels. Rather surprisingly, we can show this is the case for two labels, but
not for more than two labels. To this end, we determine the order type of the
notation systems for addition-free theta functions in terms of ordinals less
than $\varepsilon_0$. We further show that the maximal order type of the
Friedman ordering can be obtained by a certain ordinal notation system which is
based on specific binary theta functions.

between two integrable limits, the non-dimerized and the fully dimerized where
the chain breaks up into isolated dimers. This conclusion is supported by the
distribution of the local operator off-diagonal elements between the
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with respect to their energy difference, which
determines the strength of temporal fluctuations. The off-diagonal elements
have a low-energy peak for small dimerization which facilitates thermalization,
and originates in the reduction of spatial symmetry with respect to the
non-dimerized limit. For increasing dimerization their distribution changes and
develops a single low-energy maximum that relates to the fully dimerized limit
and slows down thermalization.

in somatic cells. However, the processes of how DNA changes are produced and
how they accumulate in somatic cells are not clear. DNA changes include two
types: point DNA mutations and chromosome changes. However, point DNA mutations
(DNA mutations) are the main type of DNA changes that can remain and accumulate
in cells. Severe DNA injuries are the causes for DNA mutations. However,
Misrepair of DNA is an essential process for transforming a DNA injury into a
survivable and inheritable DNA mutation. In somatic cells, Misrepair of DNA is
the main source of DNA mutations. Since the surviving chance of a cell by
Misrepair of DNA is low, accumulation of DNA mutations can take place only
possibly in the cells that can proliferate. Tumors can only develop in the
tissues that are regenerable. The accumulation of Misrepairs of DNA needs to
proceed in many generations of cells, and cell transformation from a normal
cell into a tumor cell is a slow and long process. However, once a cell is
transformed especially when it is malignantly transformed, the deficiency of
DNA repair and the rapid cell proliferation will accelerate the accumulation of
DNA mutations. The process of accumulation of DNA mutations is actually the
process of aging of a genome DNA. Repeated cell injuries and repeated cell
regenerations are the two preconditions for tumor-development. For cancer
prevention, a moderate and flexible living style is advised.

collagen fibers with age. Tissue fibrosis is associated with aging of most of
our organs, and it is the main pathology in arteriosclerosis, chronic
bronchitis/emphysema, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The causes and
characteristics of fibrosis are analyzed with Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism
proposed in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. Tissue fibrosis is known to be
a result of repairs of tissue by collagen fibers. A repair with collagen fibers
is a manner of ""Misrepair"". The collagen fibers are used for replacing dead
cells or disrupted extracellular matrixes (ECMs) including elastic fibers,
myofibers, and basement membrane. The progressive tissue fibrosis with age
manifests the essential role of Misrepair in aging, because it reveals three
facts: A. a process of Misrepair exists; B. Misrepairs are unavoidable; and C.
Misrepairs accumulate. As a result of accumulation of Misrepairs of tissue with
collagen fibers, tissue fibrosis is focalized and self-accelerating, appearing
as growing of spots of hyaline degeneration. Fibrosis results in stiffness or
atrophy of an organ and progressive failure of the organ. In arteriosclerosis,
the deposition of collagen fibers in arterial wall is for replacing disrupted
elastic fibers or myofibers, however results in hardness of the wall. Wrinkle
formation is part of skin fibrosis, and it may be a result of accumulation of
collagen fibers of different lengths. Senile hair-loss and hair-whitening are
probably consequence of dermal fibrosis. In conclusion, tissue fibrosis is a
result of accumulation of Misrepairs of tissue with collagen fibers, and the
phenomenon of fibrosis is a powerful proof for the central role of Misrepair in
aging.

fundamental to sample large-scale online social systems and to retrieve
resources in peer-to-peer systems. Biased random walks, i.e. walks whose motion
is biased on properties of neighbouring nodes, have been largely exploited to
design smart local strategies to explore a network, for instance by
constructing maximally mixing trajectories or by allowing an almost uniform
sampling of the nodes. Here we introduce and study biased random walks on
multiplex networks, graphs where the nodes are related through different types
of links organised in distinct and interacting layers, and we provide
analytical solutions for their long-time properties, including the stationary
occupation probability distribution and the entropy rate. We focus on
degree-biased random walks and distinguish between two classes of walks, namely
those whose transition probability depends on a number of parameters which is
extensive in the number of layers, and those whose motion depends on
intrinsically multiplex properties of the neighbouring nodes. We analyse the
effect of the structure of the multiplex network on the steady-state behaviour
of the walkers, and we find that heterogeneous degree distributions as well as
the presence of inter-layer degree correlations and edge overlap determine the
extent to which a multiplex can be efficiently explored by a biased walk.
Finally we show that, in real-world multiplex transportation networks, the
trade-off between efficient navigation and resilience to link failure has
resulted into systems whose diffusion properties are qualitatively different
from those of appropriately randomised multiplex graphs. This fact suggests
that multiplexity is an important ingredient to include in the modelling of
real-world systems.

respect to `arbitrary' perturbations is still widely open. The focus is put
here on stability with respect to perturbations of the same period as the wave,
for KdV-like systems of one-dimensional Hamiltonian PDEs. Stability criteria
are derived and investigated first in a general abstract framework, and then
applied to three basic examples that are very closely related, and ubiquitous
in mathematical physics, namely, a quasilinear version of the generalized
Korteweg--de Vries equation (qKdV), and the Euler--Korteweg system in both
Eulerian coordinates (EKE) and in mass Lagrangian coordinates (EKL). Those
criteria consist of a necessary condition for spectral stability, and of a
sufficient condition for orbital stability. Both are expressed in terms of a
single function, the abbreviated action integral along the orbits of waves in
the phase plane, which is the counterpart of the solitary waves moment of
instability introduced by Boussinesq. Regarding solitary waves, the celebrated
Grillakis--Shatah--Strauss stability criteria amount to looking for the sign of
the second derivative of the moment of instability with respect to the wave
speed. For periodic waves, the most striking results obtained here can be
summarized as: an odd value for the difference between N -- the size of the PDE
system -- and the negative signature of the Hessian of the action implies
spectral instability, whereas a negative signature of the same Hessian being
equal to N implies orbital stability. Since these stability criteria are merely
encoded by the negative signature of matrices, they can at least be checked
numerically. Various numerical experiments are presented, which clearly
discriminate between stable cases and unstable cases for (qKdV), (EKE) and
(EKL).

applications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems,
such as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in
many-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum
transport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a
classical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a
noisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator
in Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an
irreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many
applications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of
genuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here,
recent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are
discussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition,
to the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the
quantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series
of examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system
dynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new
perspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a
quantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is
interacting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of
non-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal
correlations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the
initial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their
local detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and
control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.

ionized gas metallicity and excitation for a sample of isolated lenticular

the isolated lenticular galaxies: the mean stellar ages of the bulges and disks
are distributed between 1 and > 13 Gyr, and the bulge and the disk in every
galaxy formed synchronously demonstrating similar stellar ages and
magnesium-to-iron ratios. Extended ionized-gas disks are found in the majority
of the isolated lenticular galaxies, in 72%$\pm$11%. The half of all extended
gaseous disks demonstrate visible counterrotation with respect to their stellar
counterparts. We argue that just such fraction of projected counterrotation is
expected if all the gas in isolated lenticular galaxies is accreted from
outside, under the assumption of isotropically distributed external sources. A
very narrow range of the gas oxygen abundances found by us for the outer
ionized gas disks excited by young stars, [O/H] from 0.0 to +0.2 dex, gives
evidence for the satellite merging as the most probable source of this

problems. For an important case that each wiretap-set with cardinality not
larger than $r$, Cai and Yeung proposed a coding scheme, which is optimal in
the senses of maximizing the number of source symbols and at the same time
minimizing the number of random symbols. In this letter, we further study
achievable lower bound on the number of random key and show that it just
depends on the security constraint, and particularly, is independent to the
information amount for transmission. This implies that when the number of
transmitted source message changes, we can't reduce the number of random key to
keep the same security level. We further give an intuitive interpretation on
our result. In addition, a similar construction of secure linear network codes
is proposed, which achieves this lower bound on the number of random key no

Fock space fields and the fermionic Fock space of states and their relations in
case of the Ising free fermions. Furthermore, we investigate the conformal
structure of the fermionic Fock space fields and the Clifford VOA, namely the
operator product expansions, correlation functions and differential equations.
Finally, by using the Clifford VOA and the fermionic CFT, we investigate a
rigorous realization of the CFT/SLE correspondence in the Ising model. First,
by studying the relation between the operator formalism in the Clifford VOA and
the SLE martingale generators, we find an explicit Fock space for the SLE
martingale generators. Second, we obtain a subset of the SLE martingale

materials for many applications ranging from light emitting diodes to
transistors. The low spin-orbit coupling typical for carbon-based materials and
the resulting long spin lifetimes give rise to a large influence of the
electron spin on charge transport which can be exploited in spintronic devices
or to improve solar cell efficiencies. Magnetic resonance techniques are
particularly helpful to elucidate the microscopic structure of paramagnetic
states in semiconductors as well as the transport processes they are involved
in. However, in organic devices the nature of the dominant spin-dependent
processes is still subject to considerable debate. Using multi-frequency pulsed
electrically detected magnetic resonance (pEDMR), we show that the
spin-dependent response of P3HT/PCBM solar cells at low temperatures is
governed by bipolar polaron pair recombination involving the positive and
negative polarons in P3HT and PCBM, respectively, thus excluding a unipolar
bipolaron formation as the main contribution to the spin-dependent charge
transfer in this temperature regime. Moreover the polaron-polaron coupling
strength and the recombination times of polaron pairs with parallel and
antiparallel spins are determined. Our results demonstrate that the pEDMR pulse
sequences recently developed for inorganic semiconductor devices can very
successfully be transferred to the study of spin and charge transport in
organic semiconductors, in particular when the different polarons can be
distinguished spectrally.

contains the Abelian $D(\mathbb{Z}_4)$ anyons as low-energetic excitations. We
show that braiding of these parafermions with each other and with the

generated. The error correction problem for our model is also studied in
detail, guaranteeing fault-tolerance of the topological operations. Crucially,
since the non-Abelian anyons are engineered through defect lines rather than as

correction problem is performed on the underlying Abelian model, allowing high
noise thresholds to be realized.
