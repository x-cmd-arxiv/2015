analysis due to different presentational forms for each character of the
alphabet. The words of the document will be formed by the joining of the
correct positional glyphs representing corresponding presentational forms of
the characters. A set of rules defines the joining of the glyphs. As usual,
these rules vary from language to language and are subject to interpretation by
the software developers.
  In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for contextual analysis
based on the first order Hidden Markov Model. We will design and build a model
for the Farsi language to exhibit this technology. The Farsi model achieves 94
\% accuracy with the training based on a short list of 89 Farsi vocabularies
consisting of 2780 Farsi characters.
  The experiment can be easily extended to many languages including Arabic,
Urdu, and Sindhi. Furthermore, the advantage of this approach is that the same
software can be used to perform contextual analysis without coding complex
rules for each specific language. Of particular interest is that the languages
with fewer speakers can have greater representation on the web, since they are
typically ignored by software developers due to lack of financial incentives.

localized in a spacelike cone are dense in the one-particle space, we show here
that the subspace of states localized in any double cone is trivial. This
implies that the free field theory associated with infinite spin has no
observables localized in bounded regions. In an interacting theory, if the
vacuum vector is cyclic for a double cone local algebra, then the theory does
not contain infinite spin representations. We also prove that if a
Doplicher-Haag-Roberts representation (localized in a double cone) of a local
net is covariant under a unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group
containing infinite spin, then it has infinite statistics.

without this property where the conclusions fail. Our results hold true in any

which cops move from edge to adjacent edge, the robber moves from vertex to
adjacent vertex (but cannot move along an edge occupied by a cop). The cops win
by ""containing"" the robber, that is, by occupying all edges incident with a
vertex occupied by the robber. The minimum number of cops, $\xi(G)$, required
to contain a robber played on a graph $G$ is called the containability number,
a natural counterpart of the well-known cop number $c(G)$. This variant of the
game was recently introduced by Komarov and Mackey, who proved that for every
graph $G$, $c(G) \le \xi(G) \le \gamma(G) \Delta(G)$, where $\gamma(G)$ and
$\Delta(G)$ are the domination number and the maximum degree of $G$,
respectively. They conjecture that an upper bound can be improved and, in fact,
$\xi(G) \le c(G) \Delta(G)$. (Observe that, trivially, $c(G) \le \gamma(G)$.)
This seems to be the main question for this game at the moment. By
investigating expansion properties, we provide asymptotically almost sure
bounds on the containability number of binomial random graphs $G(n,p)$ for a
wide range of $p=p(n)$, showing that it forms an intriguing zigzag shape. This
result also proves that the conjecture holds for some range of $p$ (or holds up
to a constant or an $O(\log n)$ multiplicative factors for some other ranges).

while the economic wealth of such cities is explored through their recent
[2007-2011] aggregated tax income (ATI). This cultural problem is treated from
various points of view. First, the exact list of hagiotoponyms is obtained
through linguistic and religiosity criteria. Next, it is examined how such
cities are distributed in the Italian regions. Demographic and economic
perspectives are also offered at the Saint level, i.e. calculating the
cumulated values of the number of inhabitants and the ATI, ""per Saint"", as well
as the corresponding relative values taking into account the Saint popularity.
On one hand, frequency-size plots and cumulative distribution function plots,
and on the other hand, scatter plots and rank-size plots between the various

correlations between the variables. It is concluded that rank-rank correlations
point to a strong Saint effect, which explains what actually Saint-based

comprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions
under which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a
generalized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure
for calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain.
Subsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the
evolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate
the origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian
extrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the commonly observed extrasolar
orbital structure can be understood if planet pairs encounter mean motion
commensurabilities on slightly eccentric (e~0.02) orbits. Accordingly, we
speculate that resonant capture among low-mass planets is typically rendered
unsuccessful due to subtle axial asymmetries inherent to the global structure
of protoplanetary disks.

to have an infinite variance (and even infinite lower-order moments).

conducted in the context of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (eBOSS), which will use ~200 000 emission line galaxies (ELGs) at
0.6<zspec<1.0 to obtain a precise baryon acoustic oscillation measurement. Our
proposed selection technique is based on optical and near-infrared broad-band
filter photometry. We used a training sample to define a quantity, the Fisher
discriminant (linear combination of colours), which correlates best with the
desired properties of the target: redshift and [OII] flux. The proposed
selections are simply done by applying a cut on magnitudes and this Fisher
discriminant. We used public data and dedicated SDSS spectroscopy to quantify
the redshift distribution and [OII] flux of our ELG target selections. We
demonstrate that two of our selections fulfil the initial eBOSS/ELG redshift
requirements: for a target density of 180 deg^2, ~70% of the selected objects
have 0.6<zspec<1.0 and only ~1% of those galaxies in the range 0.6<zspec<1.0
are expected to have a catastrophic zspec estimate. Additionally, the stacked
spectra and stacked deep images for those two selections show characteristic
features of star-forming galaxies. The proposed approach using the Fisher
discriminant could, however, be used to efficiently select other galaxy
populations, based on multi-band photometry, providing that spectroscopic
information is available. This technique could thus be useful for other future
massive spectroscopic surveys such as PFS, DESI, and 4MOST.

on a selected dissociation channel of a diatomic molecule. Our pulse is
obtained as a linear combination of linearly chirped pulse functions. Data

information regarding the interplay between radiative and diabatic processes.
We performed a principal component analysis on these data to retrieve the most

a triangle, we determine the simplex splines in $\mathcal{S}$ and the six
symmetric simplex spline bases that reduce to a B-spline basis on each edge,
have a positive partition of unity, a (barycentric) Marsden identity, and
domain points with an intuitive control net. We provide a quasi-interpolant
with approximation order 6 and a Lagrange interpolant at the domain points. The
latter can be used to show that each basis is stable in the $L_\infty$ norm,
which yields an $h^2$ bound for the distance between the B\'ezier ordinates and
the values of the spline at the corresponding domain points. Finally, for one
of these bases we provide $C^0$, $C^1$, and $C^2$ conditions on the control
points of two splines on adjacent macrotriangles, and a conversion to the
Hermite nodal basis.

also referred to as decision-theoretic classification, for non-decomposable
binary classification metrics such as F-measure and Jaccard coefficient. Our
key result is that the expected out-of-sample utility for many performance
metrics is provably optimized by a classifier which is equivalent to a signed
thresholding of the conditional probability of the positive class. Our analysis
bridges a gap in the literature on binary classification, revealed in light of
recent results for non-decomposable metrics in population utility maximization
style classification. Our results identify checkable properties of a
performance metric which are sufficient to guarantee a probability ranking
principle. We propose consistent estimators for optimal expected out-of-sample
classification. As a consequence of the probability ranking principle,
computational requirements can be reduced from exponential to cubic complexity
in the general case, and further reduced to quadratic complexity in special
cases. We provide empirical results on simulated and benchmark datasets
evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms for decision-theoretic
classification and comparing them to baseline and state-of-the-art methods in
population utility maximization for non-decomposable metrics.

bipolar active regions (ARs). These extended features, called magnetic tongues,
are interpreted as a consequence of the azimuthal component of the magnetic
flux in the toroidal flux-tubes that form ARs. We develop a new systematic and
user-independent method to identify AR tongues. Our method is based on
determining and analyzing the evolution of the AR main polarity inversion line
(PIL). The effect of the tongues is quantified by measuring the acute angle [
tau] between the orientation of the PIL and the direction orthogonal to the AR
main bipolar axis. We apply a simple model to simulate the emergence of a
bipolar AR. This model lets us interpret the effect of magnetic tongues on
parameters that characterize ARs ( e.g. the PIL inclination and the tilt
angles, and their evolution). In this idealized kinematic emergence model, tau
is a monotonically increasing function of the twist and has the same sign as
the magnetic helicity. We systematically apply our procedure to a set of
bipolar ARs that were observed emerging in line-of-sight magnetograms over
eight years. For most of the cases studied, the tongues only have a small
influence on the AR tilt angle since tongues have a much lower magnetic flux
than the more concentrated main polarities. From the observed evolution of tau,
corrected for the temporal evolution of the tilt angle and its final value when
the AR is fully emerged, we estimate the average number of turns in the
subphotospherically emerging flux-rope. These values for the 41 observed ARs
are below unity, except for one. This indicates that subphotospheric flux-ropes
typically have a low amount of twist, i.e. highly twisted flux-tubes are rare.
Our results demonstrate that the evolution of the PIL is a robust indicator of
the presence of tongues and constrains the amount of twist in emerging
flux-tubes

and most challenging of these problems is turbulence. Yet, despite these
advances, the extreme parameter regimes encountered in space physics and
astrophysics (as in atmospheric and oceanic physics) still preclude direct
numerical simulation. Numerical models must take a Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
approach, explicitly computing only a fraction of the active dynamical scales.
The success of such an approach hinges on how well the model can represent the
subgrid-scales (SGS) that are not explicitly resolved. In addition to the
parameter regime, heliophysical and astrophysical applications must also face
an equally daunting challenge: magnetism. The presence of magnetic fields in a
turbulent, electrically conducting fluid flow can dramatically alter the
coupling between large and small scales, with potentially profound implications
for LES/SGS modeling. In this review article, we summarize the state of the art
in LES modeling of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. After discussing
the nature of MHD turbulence and the small-scale processes that give rise to
energy dissipation, plasma heating, and magnetic reconnection, we consider how
these processes may best be captured within an LES/SGS framework. We then
consider several specific applications in heliophysics and astrophysics,
assessing triumphs, challenges, and future directions.

we construct a protocol based on asking and receiving spectrum usage favors by

exchanged between the operators if one is asking for a permission to use some
of the resources from the pool on an exclusive basis, and the other is willing

take action. An operator with a high load may take spectrum usage favors from
an operator that has few users to serve, and it is likely to return these
favors in the future to show a cooperative spirit and maintain reciprocity. We
formulate the interactions between the operators as a repeated game and
determine rules to decide whether to ask or grant a favor at each stage game.

evolution of dark energy than just its derivative. We show that this function
can be well determined at low redshift from supernovae using Gaussian
Processes, and that this method is far superior to a variety of
parameterisations which are also subject to priors on the matter density. This
shows that parametrised models give very biased constraints on the evolution of
dark energy.

similar rights for accessing spectrum. A coordination protocol acting on the
level of the Radio Access Network (RAN) is designed. The protocol is
non-cooperative, but assumes an agreement to a set of negotiation rules. The
signaling overhead is low, and knowledge of competitor's channel state
information is not assumed. No monetary transactions are involved; instead,
spectrum sharing is based on a RAN-internal virtual currency. The protocol is
applicable in a scenario of mutual renting and when the operators form a
spectrum pool. The protocol is reactive to variations in interference and load
of the operators, and shows gains in a simulated small cell scenario compared
to not using any coordination protocol.

expected at the CERN High-Luminosity LHC. 200 $\mu$m thick n-type silicon
sensors are irradiated with protons of different energies to fluences of up to
$3 \cdot 10^{15}$ neq/cm$^2$. Pulsed red laser light with a wavelength of 672
nm is used to generate electron-hole pairs in the sensors. The induced signals
are used to determine the charge collection efficiencies separately for
electrons and holes drifting through the sensor. The effective trapping rates
are extracted by comparing the results to simulation. The electric field is
simulated using Synopsys device simulation assuming two effective defects. The
generation and drift of charge carriers are simulated in an independent
simulation based on PixelAV. The effective trapping rates are determined from
the measured charge collection efficiencies and the simulated and measured
time-resolved current pulses are compared. The effective trapping rates
determined for both electrons and holes are about 50% smaller than those
obtained using standard extrapolations of studies at low fluences and suggests
an improved tracker performance over initial expectations.

consider here how the transform affects the performance of two search

1997; Chickering 2002). We find that the transform is harmless but ineffective
for most cases but quite effective in very special cases for GES, namely, for
moderate non-Gaussianity and moderate non-linearity. For strong-linearity,
another algorithm, PC-GES (a combination of PC with GES), is equally effective.

an expansion parameter related to the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric

which certain first-order effects are taken into account in the zeroth-order

leads to the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with the same structure
as in vacuum to first order in the expansion parameter. It facilitates
immediate physical interpretation of the formulas, and makes the expressions
for the neutrino oscillation probabilities extremely simple and compact. We
find, for example, that the $\nu_e$ disappearance probability at this order is
of a simple two-flavor form with an appropriately identified mixing angle and
$\Delta m^2$. More generally, all the oscillation probabilities can be written
in the universal form with the channel-discrimination coefficient of $0,~\pm1$

that results in resistance to motion and energy dissipation. In spite of its
technological and economic significance, our ability to control friction
remains modest, and our understanding of the microscopic processes incomplete.
At the atomic scale, mismatch between the two contacting crystal lattices can
lead to a reduction of stick-slip friction (structural lubricity), while
thermally activated atomic motion can give rise to a complex velocity
dependence, and nearly vanishing friction at sufficiently low velocities
(thermal lubricity). Atomic force microscopy has provided a wealth of
experimental results, but limitations in the dynamic range, time resolution,
and control at the single-atom level have hampered a full quantitative
description from first principles. Here, using an ion-crystal friction emulator
with single-atom, single substrate-site spatial resolution and single-slip
temporal resolution, we measure the friction force over nearly five orders of
magnitude in velocity, and contiguously observe four distinct regimes, while
controlling temperature and dissipation. We elucidate the interplay between
thermal and structural lubricity in a system of two coupled atoms, and provide
a simple explanation in terms of the Peierls-Nabarro potential. This extensive
control at the atomic scale paves the way for fundamental studies of the
interaction of many-atom surfaces, as for example in the Frenkel-Kontorova
model, and possibly into the quantum regime.

Galactic structure by tracing the spiral arms with cluster distances. Our
results favour a four-armed spiral pattern tracing three arms,
Sagitarius-Carina, Perseus, and the Outer arm. The Sagitarius-Carina spiral arm
is probed in the borderline of the third and fourth quadrants at a distance
from the Galactic centre of $d_1\sim6.4$ kpc adopting $R_{\odot}=7.2$ kpc, or
$d_2\sim7.2$ kpc for $R_{\odot}=8.0$ kpc. Most ECs in our sample are located in
the Perseus arm that is traced in the second and third quadrants and appear to
be at Galactocentric distances in the range $d_1=9-10.5$ kpc or $d_2=9.8-11.3$
kpc. Dolidze 25, Bochum 2, and Camargo 445 are located in the Outer arm that
extends along the second and third Galactic quadrants with a distance from the

find further evidence that in the Galaxy ECs are predominantly located within
the thin disc and along spiral arms. They are excellent tools for tracing these
Galactic features and therefore new searches for ECs can contribute to a better
understanding of the Galactic structure. We also report an EC aggregate located

might be tempted to conclude that X, Y, and Z are independent. But it has long
been known in classical probability theory that, intuitive as it may seem, this

statistics can emerge for configurations of particles in certain types of
entangled states. The explicit construction of such states, along with the
specification of suitable sets of observables that have the purported
statistical properties, is not entirely straightforward. We show that an
example of such a configuration arises in the case of an N-particle GHZ state,
and we are able to identify a family of observables with the property that the
associated measurement outcomes are independent for any choice of 2, 3, ...,
N-1 of the particles, even though the measurement outcomes for all N particles
are not independent. Although such states are highly entangled, the
entanglement turns out to be 'fragile', i.e. the associated density matrix has
the property that if one traces out the freedom associated with even a single
particle, the resulting reduced density matrix is separable.

transverse oscillations in their motion. As channeled particles approach the
atomic planes of a crystal, they are likely to be dechanneled. This effect was
used in ion-beam analysis with MeV energy. We studied this effect in a bent
crystal for positive and negative particles within a wide range of energies in
sight of application of such crystals at accelerators. We found the conditions
for the appearance or not of channeling oscillations. Indeed a new kind of
oscillations, strictly related to the motion of over-barrier particles, i.e.
quasichanneling particles, has been predicted. Such oscillations, named planar
quasichanneling oscillations, possess a different nature than channeling
oscillations. Through computer simulation, we studied this effect and provided
a theoretical interpretation for them. We show that channeling oscillations can
be observed only for positive particles while quasichanneling oscillations can
exist for particles with either sign. The conditions for experimental
observation of channeling and quasichanneling oscillations at existing
accelerators with available crystal has been found and optimized.

the relatively high percolation threshold of a speckle potential in two

point-like disorder potential that circumvents this percolation limit with
localization lengths that are experimentally observable. The percolation
threshold is evaluated for experimentally realistic parameters, and a regime of

determined via scaling theory, using both exact scattering cross sections and

of the z = 7.5 galaxy A1689-zD1 requires very efficient grain growth. This, in
turn, implies that in this galaxy the average density of the cold and dense

Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation using a five transiting planet model,
leaving the stellar density and dilution with uniform priors. Using importance
sampling, we compared the model probabilities under the priors of the planets
orbiting either the brighter or the fainter component of the binary. A model
where the planets orbit the brighter component, Kepler-296A, is strongly
preferred by the data. Combined with our assertion that all five planets orbit

evidence for a UV colour-magnitude relation in high-redshift galaxies, we find
that for any plausible evolution in galaxy properties, red (brighter) galaxies
are less efficient at producing ionizing photons than their blue (fainter)

galaxies naturally increases with redshift. Secondly, for a luminosity

unusual weak-field longitudinal magnetoresistance: large, negative, and
quadratic in the magnetic field. This has been shown to arise from chiral
anomaly, i.e. nonconservation of the chiral charge in the presence of external
electric and magnetic fields, oriented collinearly. In this paper we report on
a theory of this effect in both Dirac and Weyl metals. We demonstrate that this
phenomenon contains two important ingredients. One is the
magnetic-field-induced coupling between the chiral and the total (or vector, in
relativistic field theory terminology) charge densities. This arises from the
Berry curvature and is present in principle whenever the Berry curvature is
nonzero, i.e. is nonspecific to Dirac and Weyl metals. This coupling, however,
leads to a large negative quadratic magnetoresistance only when the second
ingredient is present, namely when the chiral charge density is a nearly
conserved quantity with a long relaxation time. This property is specific to
Dirac and Weyl metals and is realized only when the Fermi energy is close to
Dirac or Weyl nodes, expressing an important low-energy property of these

orbiting the pre-main sequence binary AK Sco. By forward-modeling the disk
velocity field traced by CO J=2-1 line emission, we infer the mass of the
central binary, $M_\ast = 2.49 \pm 0.10~M_\odot$, a new dynamical measurement
that is independent of stellar evolutionary models. Assuming the disk and
binary are co-planar within $\sim$2{\deg}, this disk-based binary mass
measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity
monitoring of the combined stellar spectra. These ALMA results are also
compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of
the binary in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, using several common pre-main
sequence model grids. These models predict stellar masses that are marginally
consistent with our dynamical measurement (at $\sim 2\,\sigma$), but are
systematically high (by $\sim$10%). These same models consistently predict an
age of $18\pm1$ Myr for AK Sco, in line with its membership in the Upper
Centaurus-Lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a
gas-rich disk. As ALMA accumulates comparable data for large samples of
pre-main sequence stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical
mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for
efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.

discs orbiting white dwarfs highlight the increasing need to understand small
body evolution around both early and asymptotic giant branch (GB) stars.
Pebbles and asteroids are susceptible to strong accelerations from the intense
luminosity and winds of GB stars. Here, we establish equations that can model
time-varying GB stellar radiation, wind drag and mass loss. We derive the
complete three-dimensional equations of motion in orbital elements due to (1)
the Epstein and Stokes regimes of stellar wind drag, (2) Poynting-Robertson
drag, and (3) the Yarkovsky drift with seasonal and diurnal components. We
prove through averaging that the potential secular eccentricity and inclination
excitation due to Yarkovsky drift can exceed that from Poynting-Robertson drag
and radiation pressure by at least three orders of magnitude, possibly flinging
asteroids which survive YORP spin-up into a widely dispersed cloud around the
resulting white dwarf. The GB Yarkovsky effect alone may change an asteroid's
orbital eccentricity by ten per cent in just one Myr. Damping perturbations
from stellar wind drag can be just as extreme, but are strongly dependent on
the highly uncertain local gas density and mean free path length. We conclude
that GB radiative and wind effects must be considered when modelling the
post-main-sequence evolution of bodies smaller than about 1000 km.

produces a typical scatter of ~0.29 dex. This performance is similar to what is
achievable via low-resolution spectroscopy, and outperforms other photometric
techniques, while also being more general. I further show that a slight
alteration to the model, wherein synthetic EMP stars are added to the training
set, yields the robust identification of EMP candidates. In particular, this
synthetic-oversampling method recovers ~20% of the EMP stars in the training
set, at a precision of ~0.05. Furthermore, ~65% of the false positives from the

become heated during accretion outbursts and subsequently cool in quiescence.
Observing and modeling this thermal response has yielded valuable insight into
the physics of neutron star crusts. However, one unresolved problem is the
evidence in several neutron stars for an extra energy source, located at
shallow depth in the crust, that is not accounted for by standard heating
models. Its origin remains puzzling, and it is currently unclear whether this
additional heating occurs in all neutron stars, and if the magnitude is always
the same. Here, we report on Chandra observations that cover two years after
the 2012 outburst of the transient neutron star X-ray binary Swift
J174805.3-244637 in the globular cluster Terzan 5. The temperature of the
neutron star was elevated during the first two months following its ~8 week
accretion episode, but had decayed to the pre-outburst level within ~100 days.
Interpreting this as rapid cooling of the accretion-heated crust, we model the
observed temperature curve with a thermal evolution code. We find that there is
no need to invoke shallow heating for this neutron star, although an extra
energy release up to ~1.4 MeV/nucleon is allowed by the current data (2-sigma
confidence). We also present two new data points on the crust cooling curve of
the 11-Hz X-ray pulsar IGR J17480-2446 in Terzan 5, which was active in 2010.
The temperature of this neutron star remained significantly above its
pre-outburst level, but we detect no temperature change since the previous
measurements of 2013 February. This is consistent with the slower cooling
expected several years post-outburst.

equivalent to a periodic modulation of the cavity length, which is responsible
for the generation of the Casimir radiation. By taking into account the rapidly
oscillating terms of the modulation frequency, the effects of the corresponding
counter-rotating terms (CRTs) on the analogue Casimir radiation emerge clearly.
We find that the mean number of generated photons and their quantum statistical
properties exhibit oscillatory behaviors, which are controllable through the
modulation frequency as an external control parameter.We also recognize a new
phenomenon, the so-called ""Anti-DCE,"" in which pair photons can be coherently
annihilated due to the time-modulated pumping. We show that the Casimir
radiation exhibits quadrature squeezing, photon bunching and super-Poissonian
statistics which are controllable by modulation frequency. We also calculate
the power spectrum of the intracavity light field. We find that the appearance
of the side bands in the spectrum is due to the presence of the CRTs.

scale. We find that hadronic electric dipole moments, lepton number and flavor
violation, non-universality, as well as lepton $g-2$ can be induced at
interesting levels by hidden sectors with light degrees of freedom. In
contrast, many hadronic flavor- and baryon number-violating observables, and
precision probes of charged currents, typically require new physics with
$\Lambda_{\rm NP} \gtrsim m_W$. Among the leptonic observables, we find that a
non-zero electron electric dipole moment near the current level of sensitivity
would point to the existence of new physics at or above the electroweak scale.

regression trees, is known to deliver high prediction accuracy for diverse
tasks, and it is widely used in practice. However, it suffers an issue which we
call over-specialization, wherein trees added at later iterations tend to
impact the prediction of only a few instances, and make negligible contribution
towards the remaining instances. This negatively affects the performance of the
model on unseen data, and also makes the model over-sensitive to the
contributions of the few, initially added tress. We show that the commonly used
tool to address this issue, that of shrinkage, alleviates the problem only to a
certain extent and the fundamental issue of over-specialization still remains.
In this work, we explore a different approach to address the problem that of
employing dropouts, a tool that has been recently proposed in the context of
learning deep neural networks. We propose a novel way of employing dropouts in
MART, resulting in the DART algorithm. We evaluate DART on ranking, regression
and classification tasks, using large scale, publicly available datasets, and
show that DART outperforms MART in each of the tasks, with a significant
margin. We also show that DART overcomes the issue of over-specialization to a
considerable extent.

description of the program. In this context we have made a comprehensive study
of the young LOA open cluster NGC 2302, which includes a UBVRI photometric
analysis and determination of its kinematic properties - proper motion and
radial velocity - and of its orbital parameters. We determined the mean PM of
NGC 2302 relative to the local field of disk stars, and, through a comparison
with the UCAC4 catalog, we transformed this relative PM into an absolute one.
Using medium-resolution spectroscopy of 26 stars in the field of NGC 2302, we
derived its mean RV. Isochrone fits to the photometric diagrams allowed us to
determine the fundamental parameters of NGC 2302, including reddening,
distance, and age. The kinematic data and derived distance allowed us to
determine the space motion of NGC 2302. This was done by adopting a
time-independent, axisymmetric, and fully analytic gravitational potential for
the MW. We obtained an absolute PM for NGC 2302 of ($\mu_{\alpha}
\cos\delta,\mu_{\delta}) = (-2.09,-2.11)$ mas/yr, with standard errors of 0.410
and 0.400 mas/yr. The mean RV of NGC 2302 turned out to be 31.2 km/sec with a
standard error of 0.7 km/sec. Isochrone fits displaced for this reddening and
for a distance modulus of (m-M)o = 10.69 indicate an age of log(t) = 7.90-8.00
with a slight tendency toward the younger age. Inspection of the shape of the
orbit of NGC 2302 and the resulting orbital parameters indicate that it is a

control problems that can be solved formally as a Feyman-Kac path integral and
can be estimated using Monte Carlo sampling. In this contribution we review
path integral control theory in the finite horizon case.
  We subsequently focus on the problem how to compute and represent control
solutions. Within the PI theory, the question of how to compute becomes the
question of importance sampling. Efficient importance samplers are state
feedback controllers and the use of these requires an efficient representation.
Learning and representing effective state-feedback controllers for non-linear
stochastic control problems is a very challenging, and largely unsolved,
problem. We show how to learn and represent such controllers using ideas from
the cross entropy method. We derive a gradient descent method that allows to
learn feed-back controllers using an arbitrary parametrisation. We refer to
this method as the Path Integral Cross Entropy method or PICE. We illustrate
this method for some simple examples.
  The path integral control methods can be used to estimate the posterior
distribution in latent state models. In neuroscience these problems arise when
estimating connectivity from neural recording data using EM. We demonstrate the
path integral control method as an accurate alternative to particle filtering.

Our work in this project was to develop a source-to-source compiler, MANET, for
the C language that could be used for instrumentation of critical parts of
applications under testing. The intention was to guide the compilation flow and
define instrumentation strategies using the Aspect-Oriented Approach provided
by LARA. This allows a separation of the original target application and the
instrumentation secondary concerns.
  One of the goals of this work was the development of a source-to-source C
compiler that modifies code according to an input strategy. These modifications
could provide code transformations that target performance and instrumentation
for debugging, but in this work they are used to inject code that collects
information about the values that certain variables take during runtime. This
compiler is supported by an AOP approach that enables the definition of
instrumentation strategies. We decided to extend an existing source-to-source
compiler, Cetus, and couple it with LARA, an AOP language that is partially
abstracted from the target programming language.
  We propose and evaluate an approach to detect faults in C programs by
monitoring the range values of variables. We consider various monitoring
strategies and use two real-life applications, the GZIP file compressor and
ABS, a program provided by an industrial partner. The different strategies were
specified in LARA and automatically applied using MANET. The experimental
results show that our approach has potential but is hindered by not accounting
for values in arrays and control variables. We achieve prediction accuracies of
around 54% for ABS and 83% for GZIP, when comparing our approach to a more
traditional one, where the outputs are compared to an expected result.

expansion history of the universe without specifying its matter content nor any
theory of gravitation. Assuming only an isotropic, homogeneous and flat
universe, in this work we introduce a model-independent method to reconstruct
directly the deceleration function via a piecewise function. Including a
penalty factor, we are able to vary continuously the complexity of the
deceleration function from a linear case to an arbitrary $(n+1)$-knots spline
interpolation. We carry out a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis to determine the best
penalty factor, evaluating the bias-variance trade-off, given the uncertainties
of the SDSS-II and SNLS supernova combined sample (JLA), compilations of baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) and $H(z)$ data. The bias-variance analysis is done
for three fiducial models with different features in the deceleration curve.
For each fiducial model, we test different reconstructions using, in each case,
more than $10^4$ catalogs in a total of about $5\times 10^5$. This
investigation proved to be essential in determining the best reconstruction to
study these data. We show that, evaluating a single fiducial model, the
conclusions about the bias-variance ratio are misleading. We determine the
reconstruction method in which the bias represents at most $10\%$ of the total
uncertainty. Finally, we apply the Ensemble Sampler Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(ESMCMC) method to explore the posterior of the deceleration function up to
redshift $1.3$ (using only JLA) and $2.3$ (JLA+BAO+$H(z)$). We obtain that the
standard cosmological model agrees within $3\sigma$ level with the
reconstructed results in the whole studied redshift intervals. Since our method
is calibrated to minimize the bias, the error bars of the reconstructed
functions are a good approximation for the total uncertainty.

dot under the influence of background disorder potential and magnetic field. At
low temperatures, the evolution of the charge-stability diagram as a function
of B-field is investigated up to 10 Tesla. Our results indicate that the
charging energy of quantum dot is reduced, and hence the size of the dot
increases, at high magnetic field. We provide an explanation of our results
using a tight-binding model, which describes the charge redistribution in a
disordered graphene quantum dot via the formation of Landau levels and edge
states. Our model suggests that the tunnel barriers separating different
electron/hole puddles in a dot become transparent at high B-fields, resulting
in the charge delocalization and reduced charging energy observed
experimentally.

method has reduced the number of rating scale items (variables) to 28.57\%
(from 21 to 6) making over 70\% of collected data unnecessary.
  Results have been verified by two methods of analysis: Graded Response Model

differentiates observations of high and middle scores. CFA proved that the
reliability of the rating scale has not deteriorated by the scale item
reduction. Both statistical analysis evidenced usefulness of the AUC ROC

the NK Echo State Network is reduced to the problem of optimizing a special

used; all learning is accomplished by spinning up (turning on) or spinning down
(turning off) neurons in order to find a combination of neurons that work
together to achieve the desired computation. For special types of NK
Landscapes, an exact global solution can be obtained in polynomial time using
dynamic programming. The NK Echo State Network is applied to a reinforcement

active in the so-called dead zones of protoplanetary accretion disks. A recent
analysis indicates that a subset of unstable modes shows unbounded growth -
both as resolution is increased and when the nominal lid of the atmosphere is
extended, possibly indicating ill-posedness in previous attempts of linear
analysis. The reduced equations governing the instability are revisited and the
generated solutions are examined using both the previously assumed separable
forms and an improved non-separable solution form that is herewith introduced.
Analyzing the reduced equations using the separable form shows that, while the
low-order body modes have converged eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (as both the
vertical boundaries of the atmosphere are extended and with increased radial
resolution), it is also confirmed that the corresponding high-order body modes
and the surface modes do indeed show unbounded growth rates. However, the
energy contained in both the higher-order body modes and surface modes
diminishes precipitously due to the disk's Gaussian density profile. Most of
the energy of the instability is contained in the low-order modes. An
inseparable solution form is introduced which filters out the inconsequential
surface modes leaving only body modes (both low and high-order ones). The
analysis predicts a fastest growing mode with a specific radial length scale.
The growth rates associated with the fundamental corrugation and breathing
modes matches the growth and length scales observed in previous nonlinear
studies of the instability.

and doubles (CCSD) provides very accurate results for weakly correlated
systems, it usually fails in the presence of static or strong correlation. This
failure is generally attributed to the qualitative breakdown of the reference,
and can accordingly be corrected by using a multi-determinant reference,
including higher-body cluster operators in the ansatz, or allowing symmetry
breaking in the reference. None of these solutions are ideal; multi-reference
coupled cluster is not black box, including higher-body cluster operators is
computationally demanding, and allowing symmetry breaking leads to the loss of
good quantum numbers. It has long been recognized that quasidegeneracies can
instead be treated by modifying the coupled cluster ansatz. The recently
introduced pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) approach is one such example
which avoids catastrophic failures and accurately models strong correlations in
a symmetry-adapted framework. Here we generalize pCCD to a singlet-paired
coupled cluster model (CCD0) intermediate between coupled cluster doubles and
pCCD, yielding a method that possesses the invariances of the former and much
of the stability of the latter. Moreover, CCD0 retains the full structure of
coupled cluster theory, including a fermionic wave function, antisymmetric
cluster amplitudes, and well-defined response equations and density matrices.

find no evidence of differences in n(epsilon), although the nearest cluster in
the sample (the Coma Cluster) is the largest outlier (P(same) < 0.05). We then
study n(epsilon) within the clusters, and find that epsilon increases with
projected cluster-centric radius R (hereafter the epsilon-R relation). This
trend is preserved at fixed magnitude, showing that this relation exists over
and above the trend of more luminous galaxies to be both rounder and more
common in the centres of clusters. The epsilon-R relation is particularly
strong in the subsample of intrinsically flattened galaxies (epsilon > 0.4),
therefore it is not a consequence of the increasing fraction of round slow
rotator galaxies near cluster centers. Furthermore, the epsilon-R relation
persists for just smooth flattened galaxies and for galaxies with de
Vaucouleurs-like light profiles, suggesting that the variation of the spiral
fraction with radius is not the underlying cause of the trend. We interpret our
findings in light of the classification of early type galaxies (ETGs) as fast
and slow rotators. We conclude that the observed trend of decreasing epsilon
towards the centres of clusters is evidence for physical effects in clusters
causing fast rotator ETGs to have a lower average intrinsic ellipticity near
the centres of rich clusters.

control magnetism using ultrashort laser pulses. However, little is known about
the fate of the exchange interaction. Here we report unambiguously that
photoexcitation is capable of quenching the exchange interaction in all three
$3d$ ferromagnetic metals. The entire process starts with a small number of
photoexcited electrons which build up a new and self-destructive potential that
collapses the system into a new state with a reduced exchange splitting. The
spin moment reduction follows a Bloch-like law as $M_z(\Delta

the absorbed photon energy and $\beta$ is a scaling exponent. A good agreement

oscillators and two baths described by a continuous spectral density function.
Breakdown of the rotational and parity symmetries along the continuous quantum
phase transition separating the localized phase from the critical phase has
been uncovered. Moreover, the phase boundary is determined accurately with the
corresponding symmetry parameters of the rotational and parity symmetries. A
critical value of the spectral exponent s* = 0.49(1) is predicted in the weak
coupling limit, which is in agreement with the mean-field prediction of 1/2,
but much smaller than the earlier literature estimate of 0.75(1).

at a time. Using the data from these experiments, a decision tree was built
where each internal node represents the execution parameter, each branch
represents value chosen for the parameter and each leaf node represents a range
for execution time in minutes. The attribute in the decision tree to split the

Once the tree is trained with the training samples, this tree can be used to
get approximate range for the expected execution time. When the actual
execution time differs from this expected value, a performance anomaly can be
detected. For a test dataset with 400 samples, 99% of samples had actual
execution time in the range predicted time by the decision tree. Also on
analyzing the constructed tree, an idea about what configuration can give
better performance for a given workload can be obtained. Initial experiments
suggest that the impact an execution parameter can have on the target attribute

small cells become denser, which in turn makes the ASE suffer from a slow

additional processing of WISE/NEOWISE data that would aid in addressing these
most important scientific questions. The results were mainly bifurcated between
topics related to extragalactic studies (e.g. AGN, QSOs) and substellar mass

Moreover, developing or implementing machine-learning tools to comb through and

attendees agreed that additional processing of the data such as co-adding WISE

identification. It has been studied extensively due to its immense practical
importance in a variety of fields. The underlying goal is to identify the
impulse response of an unknown system. This is accomplished by placing a known
system in parallel and feeding both systems with the same input. Due to initial
disparity in their impulse responses, an error is generated between their
outputs. This error is set to tune the impulse response of known system in a
way that every change in impulse response reduces the magnitude of prospective
error. This process is repeated until the error becomes negligible and the
responses of both systems match. To specifically minimize the error, numerous
adaptive algorithms are available. They are noteworthy either for their low
computational complexity or high convergence speed. Recently, a method, known
as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), has gained much attention due to its
remarkably low computational complexity. But despite this colossal advantage,
properties of MCMC method have not been investigated for adaptive system
identification problem. This article bridges this gap by providing a complete
treatment of MCMC method in the aforementioned context.

invariance is broken but translation invariance is maintained, particles can
move at a constant velocity through the space; however, non-local,

change in the $\gamma$-ray flux being a factor of a few higher with the
presence of an accretion disk. The origin of this enhanced emission seems to be
related to the penetration of the inner pulsar magnetosphere by the accretion
disk. We propose that the radiation processes, characteristic for the rotation
powered pulsar, can co-exist with the presence of an accretion disk in the
inner pulsar magnetosphere. In our scenario additional $\gamma$-ray emission is
produced by secondary leptons, originated close to the acceleration gap, which
Compton up-scatter thermal radiation from the accretion disk to GeV energies.
The accretion disk penetrates deep into the pulsar magnetosphere allowing the
matter to fall onto the NS surface producing pulsed X-ray emission. We show
that the sum of the rotation powered pulsar $\gamma$-ray emission, produced by
the primary electrons in the curvature process, and the $\gamma$-ray emission,
produced by secondary leptons, can explain the observed high energy radiation
from the redback binary pulsar PSR J1227-4853 in the state with evidences of
the accretion disk.

induced by L0 penalties. An elegant solution to this problem is provided by the
multi-step adaptive lasso, where iteratively weighted lasso problems are
solved, whose weights are updated in such a way that the procedure converges
towards selection with L0 penalties. In this paper we introduce an adaptive
ridge procedure (AR) which mimics the adaptive lasso, but is based on weighted
Ridge problems. After introducing AR its theoretical properties are studied in
the particular case of orthogonal linear regression. For the non-orthogonal
case extensive simulations are performed to assess the performance of AR. In
case of Poisson regression and logistic regression it is illustrated how the
iterative procedure of AR can be combined with iterative maximization
procedures. The paper ends with an efficient implementation of AR in the
context of least-squares segmentation.

filter from plant input/output data collected under fault-free condition. This
problem is challenging, especially when omitting the step of building an
explicit state-space plant model in data-driven design, because the inverse of
the underlying plant dynamics is required and needs to be stable. We show that
it is possible to address this problem by relying on a system-inversion-based
fault estimation filter that is parameterized using identified Markov
parameters. Our novel data-driven approach improves estimation performance by
avoiding the propagation of model reduction errors originating from
identification of the state-space plant model into the designed filter.
Furthermore, it allows additional design freedom to stabilize the obtained
filter under the same stabilizability condition as the existing model-based
system inversion. This crucial property enables its application to sensor
faults in unstable plants, where existing data-driven filter designs could not
be applied so far due to the lack of such stability guarantees (even after
stabilizing the closed-loop system). A numerical simulation example of sensor
faults in an unstable aircraft system illustrates the effectiveness of the
proposed new method.

conditions eliminates branching and results in code which is equivalent to a
sorting network. This enables the application of further program

region (compared to the entropy of an intact region of the same size),
quantified by the loop factor. In this study we investigate how confinement
affects the DNA melting transition, by using the loop factor for an ideal
Gaussian chain. By subsequent numerical solutions of the PS model, we
demonstrate that the melting temperature depends on the persistence lengths of
single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. For realistic values of the
persistence lengths the melting temperature is predicted to decrease with
decreasing channel diameter. We also demonstrate that confinement broadens the
melting transition. These general findings hold for the three scenarios
investigated: namely 1. homo-DNA, i.e. identical basepairs along the DNA
molecule; 2. random sequence DNA, and 3. ""real"" DNA, here T4 phage DNA. We show
that cases 2 and 3 in general give rise to broader transitions than case 1.
Case 3 exhibits a similar phase transition as case 2 provided the random
sequence DNA has the same ratio of AT to GC basepairs. A simple analytical
estimate for the shift in melting temperature is provided as a function of

singularities, and a triplet $p+ip'$ superconductor in the vicinity of these
regions. Adding a weak Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling to the system further
singles out the time-reversal invariant equal-spin helical $p+ip'$ pairing as
the leading instability. The triplet pairing identified here is driven by the
ferromagnetic fluctuations, which become strong and enhance the superconducting
critical temperature remarkably near the phase boundaries between
ferromagnetism and superconductivity.

expected to form whose mass may be inferred from the gravitational radiation
emitted during the collision. If this occurs at trans-Planckian energies, it
should be well described by general relativity. Furthermore, if there exist
hidden extra dimensions, the fundamental Planck mass may well be of the order
of the TeV and thus achievable with current or future particle accelerators. By
modeling the colliding particles as Aichelburg-Sexl shock waves on a flat,
$D$-dimensional background, we devise a perturbative framework to compute the
space-time metric in the future of the collision. Then, a generalisation of
Bondi's formalism is employed to extract the gravitational radiation and
compute the inelasticity of the collision: the percentage of the initial
centre-of-mass energy that is radiated away. Using the axial symmetry of the
problem, we show that this information is encoded in a single function of the
transverse metric components - the news function. We then unveil a hidden
conformal symmetry which exists at each order in perturbation theory and thus
makes the problem effectively two-dimensional. Moreover, it allows for the
factorisation of the angular dependence of the news function, i.e. the
radiation pattern at null infinity, and clarifies the correspondence between
the perturbative series of the metric and an angular expansion off the
collision axis. The first-order estimate, or isotropic term, is computed
analytically and yields a remarkable simple formula for the inelasticity for
any $D$. Higher-order terms, however, require the use of a computer for
numerical integration. We study the integration domain and compute,
numerically, the Green's functions and the sources, thus paving the way for the
computation of the inelasticity in a future work.

the specification of the initial state of the system---no further structure is
brought into play. We call operations of this type ""tomographic measurements"",

the system. Next, we construct a disentangling operation, the outcome of which,
when the procedure is applied to a general mixed state of an entangled
composite system, is a disentangled product of pure constituent states. This
operation exists whenever the dimension of the Hilbert space is not a prime,
and can be used to model the decay of a composite system. As another example,
we show how one can make a measurement of the direction along which the spin of
a particle of spin s is oriented (s = 1/2, 1, ...). The required additional
structure in this case involves the embedding of CP(1) as a rational curve of

present theoretical calculations of a hybrid silicon-metallic system in which a
single gold nanoantenna embedded in a single-mode silicon waveguide acts as a
resonance-driven filter. As a consequence of scattering and interference, when
the resonance condition of the antenna is met, the transmission drops by 85% in
the resonant frequency band. Firstly, we study analytically the interaction
between the propagating mode and the antenna by including radiative corrections
to the scattering process and the polarization of the waveguide walls.
Secondly, we find the configuration of maximum interaction and numerically
simulate a realistic nanoantenna in a silicon waveguide. The numerical
calculations show a large suppression of transmission and three times more
scattering than absorption, consequent with the analytical model. The system we
propose can be easily fabricated by standard silicon and plasmonic lithographic
methods, making it promising as real component in future optoelectronic

query processing. It is a tool for dealing with the huge data volumes where
response time is more important than perfect accuracy (this is typically the

AQP, one of them is based on probability density functions (PDF). PDFs are
typically calculated using nonparametric data-driven methods. One of the most
popular nonparametric method is the kernel density estimator (KDE). However, a
very serious drawback of using KDEs is the large number of calculations

entanglement swapping is a special class of a wider range of gluing operations.
The gluing operation of two m and n qudit states consists of an entangling
operation on two given qudits of the the two states followed by operations of
measurements of the two qudits in the computational basis. Depending on how
many qudits (two, one or zero) we measure, we have three classes of gluing
operation, resulting respectively in m+n-2, m+n-1 or m+n qudit states.
Entanglement swapping belongs to the first class and has been widely studied,
while the other two classes are presented and studied here. In particular we
study how larger GHZ and W states can be constructed when we glue the smaller
GHZ and W states by the second method. Finally we prove that when we glue two
states by the third method, the k-uniformity of the states is preserved. That
is when a k-uniform state of m qudits is glued to a k'-uniform state of n
qudits, the resulting state will be a min(k,k')-uniform of m+n qudits.

Hessian andspatial coordinates, we present a general theory for obtaining
comparison principles and well posedness for the associated Dirichlet problem
with continuous boundary data. In particular, we treat admissible viscosity
solutions of elliptic branches of the equation, where the nonlinearity need not
be monotone on all of the space of symmetric N by N matrices. An elliptic
branch (in the sense of Krylov, 1995) of the equation is encoded by a set
valued map from the coordinate domain into the elliptic subsets of the
symmetric matrices (an elliptic map). The nonlinearity will be monotone along
this map and the degenerate elliptic PDE is replaced by the a differential
inclusion. Weak solutions to such differential inclusions are defined by using
the notion given by Harvey-Lawson (2009) in a pointwise manner. If the elliptic
map is uniformly upper semicontinuous, we show that the comparison principle
holds for these weak solutions and that Perron's method yields a unique
continuous solution to the associated abstract Dirichlet problem provided that
the boundary is suitably convex with respect to the elliptic mapand its dual in
the sense of Harvey and Lawson. When the map encodes an elliptic branch of a
given PDE, these soluitions are shown to be admissible viscosity solutions of
the PDE problem. Various applications are described in terms of structural
conditions which ensure the existence of the needed elliptic map. Examples
include non-totally degenerate equations and equations involving the
eigenvalues of the Hessian and their perturbations. In certain situations, the
methods employed here will be shown to operate freely, while classical

only on the observed cell counts. They are useful and important for model

love of simple laws and uncovering common causes among seemingly unrelated
phenomena. However, many reported power laws lack statistical support and
mechanistic backings, not to mention discrepancies with real data are often
explained away as corrections due to finite size or other variables. We propose
a simple experiment and rigorous statistical procedures to look into these
issues. Making use of the fact that the occurrence rate and pulse intensity of
crumple sound obey power law with an exponent that varies with material, we
simulate a complex system with two driving mechanisms by crumpling two
different sheets together. The probability function of crumple sound is found
to transit from two power-law terms to a {\it bona fide} power law as
compaction increases. In addition to showing the vicinity of these two
distributions in the phase space, this observation nicely demonstrates the
effect of interactions to bring about a subtle change in macroscopic behavior
and more information may be retrieved if the data are subject to sorting. Our
analyses are based on the Akaike information criterion that is a direct
measurement of information loss and emphasizes the need to strike a balance
between model simplicity and goodness of fit. As a show of force, the Akaike
information criterion also found the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes and
the scale-free model for brain functional network, 2-dimensional sand pile, and
solar flare intensity to suffer excessive loss of information. They resemble
more the crumpled-together ball at low compactions in that there appear to be
two driving mechanisms that take turns occurring.

identifying differential gene expression (DGE). When $n_r=3$, seven of the nine

high fold-change genes ($|log_{2}(FC)|\gt2$) the TPR is $\gt85$ percent. Two
tools performed poorly; over- or under-predicting the number of differentially

$n_r\gt12$ when identifying DGE irrespective of fold-change is important. For

orders of magnitude down to the lowest $p_T$ region in $pp$ collisions at LHC

indirectly the possible dominance of the hard-scattering process over
essentially the whole $p_T$ region at central rapidity in high-energy $pp$ and
$p \bar p$ collisions. We show here direct evidences of such a dominance of the

spectra over an extended $p_T$ region and the two-particle correlation data of
the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations in high-energy $pp$ and $p \bar p$

hard-scattering product partons alters the power index of the hadron spectra
and leads to a hadron distribution that may be cast into a single-particle
nonextensive statistical mechanical distribution. Because of such a connection,
the nonextensive statistical mechanical distribution may be considered as a
lowest-order approximation of the hard-scattering of partons followed by the
subsequent process of parton showering that turns the jets into hadrons, in

However, inferential tools to verify this assumption are somewhat lacking in
high-dimensional or functional {data analysis} settings, where this assumption
is most relevant. We propose here to test separability by focusing on
$K$-dimensional projections of the difference between the covariance operator
and a nonparametric separable approximation. The subspace we project onto is
one generated by the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator estimated under
the separability hypothesis, negating the need to ever estimate the full
non-separable covariance. We show that the rescaled difference of the sample
covariance operator with its separable approximation is asymptotically
Gaussian. As a by-product of this result, we derive asymptotically pivotal
tests under Gaussian assumptions, and propose bootstrap methods for
approximating the distribution of the test statistics. We probe the finite

We consider primary and cognitive base stations, each equipped with multiple
antennas and serving multiple users. Primary networks often suffer from the
cognitive interference, which can be mitigated by deploying beamforming at the
cognitive systems to spatially direct the transmissions away from the primary
receivers. The accuracy of the estimated channel state information (CSI) plays
an important role in designing accurate beamformers that can regulate the
amount of interference. However, channel estimate is affected by interference.
Therefore, we propose different channel estimation and pilot allocation
techniques to deal with the channel estimation at the cognitive systems, and to
reduce the impact of contamination at the primary and cognitive systems. In an
effort to tackle the contamination problem in primary and cognitive systems, we
exploit the information embedded in the covariance matrices to successfully
separate the channel estimate from other users' channels in correlated
cognitive single input multiple input (SIMO) channels. A minimum mean square
error (MMSE) framework is proposed by utilizing the second order statistics to
separate the overlapping spatial paths that create the interference. We
validate our algorithms by simulation and compare them to the state of the art

Standard finite-difference methods can be used for the discretisation of

mode property $\left(k_{\parallel}\ll k_{\perp}\right)$ of structures is
exploited computationally by a grid sparsification in the toroidal direction. A
field line following discretisation of parallel operators is then required,
which is achieved via a finite difference along magnetic field lines. This
includes field line tracing and interpolation or integration. The main emphasis
of this paper is on the discretisation of the parallel diffusion operator.
Based on the support operator method a scheme is constructed which exhibits
only very low numerical perpendicular diffusion. The schemes are implemented in
the new code GRILLIX, and extensive benchmarks are presented which show the
validity of the approach in general and GRILLIX in particular. The main
advantage of the approach is that it does not rely on field/flux-aligned, which
become singular on the separatrix/X-point. Most tokamaks are based on the
divertor concept, and the numerical treatment of the separatrix is therefore of
importance for simulations of the edge and scrape-off layer.

structures more massive than 10^12 M_sun. Within a factor of two, these numbers
are robust to changes in the assumed astrophysics, and the scatterings would be
captured in cosmological simulations. However, for particle physics models with
a velocity-dependent cross-section (as for Yukawa potential interactions via a
massive mediator), the scattering rate peaks before z~20, in objects with mass
less than 10^4 M_sun. These precise values are sensitive to the
redshift-dependent mass-concentration relation and the small-scale cutoff in
the matter power spectrum. In extreme cases, the qualitative effect of early

that the temperature at the boundary of the domain is prescribed and is
nonconstant, so that the system is forced out of equilibrium. Our main result
is local thermal equilibrium in the infinite volume limit. In the Hamiltonian
context, this would mean that at any location $x$ in the domain, local marginal
distributions of NESS tend to a probability with density $\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta
(x) H}$, permitting one to define the local temperature at $x$ to be
$\beta(x)^{-1}$. We prove also that in the infinite volume limit, the mean
energy profile of NESS satisfies Laplace's equation for the prescribed boundary
condition. Our method of proof is duality: by reversing the sample paths of
particle movements, we convert the problem of studying local marginal energy
distributions at $x$ to that of joint hitting distributions of certain random
walks starting from $x$, and prove that the walks in question become
increasingly independent as system size tends to infinity.

of natural laws. Relativity theory shows that the comparison of times measured
by different clocks depends on their relative motions and on the strength of
the gravitational field in which they are embedded. In standard cosmology, the
time parameter is the one measured by fundamental clocks, i.e. clocks at rest
with respect to the expanding space. This proper time is assumed to flow at a
constant rate throughout the whole history of the Universe. We make the
alternative hypothesis that the rate at which cosmological time flows depends
on the dynamical state of the Universe. In thermodynamics, the arrow of time is
strongly related to the second law, which states that the entropy of an
isolated system will always increase with time or, at best, stay constant.
Hence, we assume that time measured by fundamental clocks is proportional to
the entropy of the region of the Universe that is causally connected to them.
Under that simple assumption, we build a cosmological model that explains the
Type Ia Supernovae data (the best cosmological standard candles) without the
need for exotic dark matter nor dark energy.

  All the results are proved in a sharp form involving an upper bound on the

inequalities for essentially non-branching $CD^*(K,N)$ spaces take the same
form of the corresponding ones holding for a weighted Riemannian manifold

to the reduced curvature-dimension condition $CD^*(K,N)$. Therefore we also
have shown that sharp Brunn-Minkowski inequality in the \emph{global} form can
be deduced from the \emph{local} curvature-dimension condition, providing a

conjecture that the MBHB hardening rate is equivalent to that of a binary
immersed in a field of unbound stars with density $\rho$ and typical velocity
$\sigma$, provided that $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are the stellar density and the
velocity dispersion at the influence radius of the MBHB. By comparing direct
N-body simulations to an hybrid model based on 3-body scattering experiments,
we verify this hypothesis: when normalized to the stellar density and velocity
dispersion at the binary influence radius, the N-body MBHB hardening rate
approximately matches that predicted by 3-body scatterings in the investigated
cases. The eccentricity evolution obtained with the two techniques is also in
reasonable agreement. This result is particularly practical because it allows
to estimate the lifetime of MBHBs forming in dry mergers based solely on the
stellar density profile of the host galaxy. We briefly discuss some
implications of our finding for the gravitational wave signal observable by

(FDII) strategy is proposed by using the multiple model (MM) approach. The
scheme is based on multiple hybrid Kalman filters (HKF) which represents an
integration of a nonlinear mathematical model of the system with a number of
piecewise linear (PWL) models. The proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI)
scheme is capable of detecting and isolating sensor faults during the entire
operational regime of the system by interpolating the PWL models using a
Bayesian approach. Moreover, the proposed multiple HKF-based FDI scheme is
extended to identify the magnitude of a sensor fault by using a modified
generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) method which relies on the healthy
operational mode of the system. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposed
FDII methodology, extensive simulation studies are conducted for a nonlinear
gas turbine engine. Various single and concurrent sensor fault scenarios are
considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed on-line
hierarchical multiple HKF-based FDII scheme under different flight modes.
Finally, our proposed HKF-based FDI approach is compared with various filtering
methods such as the linear, extended, unscented and cubature Kalman filters
(LKF, EKF, UKF and CKF, respectively) corresponding to both interacting and
non-interacting multiple model (MM) based schemes. Our comparative studies
confirm the superiority of our proposed HKF method in terms of promptness of
the fault detection, lower false alarm rates, as well as robustness with

As the possible mechanisms underlying such correlated bursts are far from being
fully understood, we devise a simple model for correlated bursts by using a
self-exciting point process with variable memory range. Here the probability
that a new event occurs is determined by a memory function that is the sum of
decaying memories of the past events. In order to incorporate the noise and/or
limited memory capacity of systems, we apply two memory loss mechanisms, namely
either fixed number or variable number of memories. By using theoretical
analysis and numerical simulations we find that excessive amount of memory
effect may lead to a Poissonian process, which implies that for memory effect
there exists an intermediate range that will generate correlated bursts of

  Ogievetsky-Polubarinov and Arbitrary Mass Terms",,"Annals of Physics 365 (2016) pp. 73-90","10.1016/j.aop.2015.12.002",,"gr-qc physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Einstein's equations were derived for a free massless spin-$2$ field using
universal coupling in the 1950-70s by various authors; total stress-energy
including gravity's served as a source for linear free field equations. A
massive variant was likewise derived in the late 1960s by Freund, Maheshwari
and Schonberg, and thought to be unique. How broad is universal coupling? In
the last decade four $1$-parameter families of massive spin-$2$ theories
(contravariant, covariant, tetrad, and cotetrad of almost any density weights)
have been derived using universal coupling. The (co)tetrad derivations included
2 of the 3 pure spin-$2$ theories due to de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolley; those
two theories first appeared in the $2$-parameter Ogievetsky-Polubarinov family
(1965), which developed the symmetric square root of the metric as a nonlinear
group realization. One of the two theories was identified as pure spin-$2$ by
Maheshwari in 1971-2, thus evading the Boulware-Deser-Tyutin-Fradkin ghost by
the time it was announced. Unlike the previous 4 families, this paper permits
_nonlinear_ field redefinitions to build the effective metric. By not insisting
in advance on knowing the observable significance of the graviton potential to
all orders, one finds that an _arbitrary_ graviton mass term can be derived
using universal coupling. The arbitrariness of a universally coupled
mass/self-interaction term contrasts sharply with the uniqueness of the
Einstein kinetic term. One might have hoped to use universal coupling as a
tie-breaking criterion for choosing among theories that are equally
satisfactory on more crucial grounds (such as lacking ghosts and having a
smooth massless limit). But the ubiquity of universal coupling implies that the
criterion doesn't favor any particular theories among those with the Einstein
kinetic term.

model using polaritons confined in an array of optical cavities. In addition to
the density-dependent interactions, this model also contains nonlinear coupling
terms between the two components of the polariton. Using a mean-field
calculation, we obtain the phase diagram which shows how these terms affect the
transition between the Mott insulator and the superfluid phase. In addition, we
employ both a perturbation approach and an exact diagonalization method to gain
more insights into the phase diagram.

  Thermodynamics",,,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A ""space drive"" is a hypothetical device that generates a propulsive force in
free space using an input of power without the need for a reaction mass. Any
device that generates photons (e.g., a laser) would qualify as a propellantless
""photon rocket,"" but the force generated by emitting photons per power input
(3.33 $\mu$N/kW) is too small to be a practical propulsion device. The ability
to generate greater force per power input would be highly desirable, but, as
demonstrated in this paper, such a device would be able to operate as a
perpetual motion machine of the first kind. Since applying a constant force
results in a constant acceleration, the kinetic energy of a mass driven by such
a device increases quadratically with time, while the energy input increases
only linearly with time. Thus, at some point, the kinetic energy of the
device-driven mass exceeds the energy input, and if this energy is collected
via decelerating the mass (via regenerative electromagnetic braking, for
example), then there would be a net gain in energy. For devices with
thrust-to-power ratios on the order of 1 N/kW that have been discussed recently
in connection with the so-called EM drive, this breakeven occurs at velocities
low enough to be feasible with current technology, clearly demonstrating the
absurdity of such a device. When relativistic effects are taken into account,
it is shown that the photon rocket can only reach energy breakeven as the
accelerated mass asymptotically approaches the speed of light. Thus, any device
with a thrust-to-power ratio greater than the photon rocket would be able to
operate as a perpetual motion machine of the first kind, and thus should be
excluded by the First Law of Thermodynamics.

  Algorithm",,,,,"cs.CY cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Data mining techniques have been widely used to mine knowledgeable
information from medical data bases. In data mining classification is a
supervised learning that can be used to design models describing important data
classes, where class attribute is involved in the construction of the
classifier. Nearest neighbor (KNN) is very simple, most popular, highly
efficient and effective algorithm for pattern recognition.KNN is a straight
forward classifier, where samples are classified based on the class of their
nearest neighbor. Medical data bases are high volume in nature. If the data set
contains redundant and irrelevant attributes, classification may produce less
accurate result. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in INDIA. In
Andhra Pradesh heart disease was the leading cause of mortality accounting for
32%of all deaths, a rate as high as Canada (35%) and USA.Hence there is a need
to define a decision support system that helps clinicians decide to take
precautionary steps. In this paper we propose a new algorithm which combines
KNN with genetic algorithm for effective classification. Genetic algorithms
perform global search in complex large and multimodal landscapes and provide
optimal solution. Experimental results shows that our algorithm enhance the
accuracy in diagnosis of heart disease.
