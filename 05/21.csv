Monitor (DIMM) used to measure the total atmospheric seeing, and a Single Star
Scidar (SSS) to measure the vertical profiles of the turbulence C_n^2(h) and
the horizontal wind velocity V(h). The optical turbulence parameters are also
calculated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with
the Trinquet-Vernin model, which describes optical effects of atmospheric
turbulence by using the local meteorological parameters. This paper presents
assessment of the optical parameters involved in high angular resolution
astronomy. Its includes seeing, isoplanatic angle, coherence time, coherence
etendue, vertical profiles of optical turbulence intensity _n^2(h)$ and
horizontal wind speed V(h). The median seeing is respectively 1.01 arcsec, 1.17
arcsec and 1.07arcsec as measured with the DIMM, the SSS and predicted with WRF

the turbulence measurements in this campaign are compared with other

peak in the dielectric permittivity, which is the accepted hallmark of all

anomaly is observed in KLT(0.02) [J. Wen et al., Phys. Rev. B 78, 144202

PbMg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$. We resolve this dichotomy by showing that the
structural correlations associated with the transition in KLT(0.02) are purely
dynamic at all temperatures, having a timescale on the order of $\sim$THz.
These fluctuations are overdamped, non-propagating, and spatially uncorrelated.
Identical measurements made on pure KTaO$_3$ show that they are absent (within
experimental error) in the undoped parent material. They exhibit a temperature
dependence that correlates well with the dielectric response, which suggests
that they are associated with local ferroelectric regions induced by the Li$^+$
doping. The ferroelectric transition that is induced by the introduction of
Li$^+$ cations is therefore characterized by quasistatic fluctuations, which
represents a stark contrast to the soft harmonic-mode-driven transition
observed in conventional perovskite ferroelectrics like PbTiO$_3$. The dynamic,
glass-like, structural correlations in KLT(0.02) are much faster than those
measured in random-field-based lead-based relaxors, which exhibit a frequency
scale of order of $\sim$GHz and are comparatively better correlated spatially.
Our results support the view that random fields give rise to the relaxor
phenomena, and that the glass-like dynamics observed here characterize a
nascent response.

the core of red giant stars slows down while evolving, requiring an efficient
physical mechanism to extract angular momentum from the inner layers. Current
stellar evolution codes fail to reproduce the observed rotation rates by
several orders of magnitude, and predict a drastic spin-up of red giant cores
instead. New efficient mechanisms of angular momentum transport are thus
required.
  In this framework, our aim is to investigate the possibility that mixed modes
extract angular momentum from the inner radiative regions of evolved low-mass
stars. To this end, we consider the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) formalism,
introduced by Andrews \& McIntyre (1978), that allows us to consider the
combined effect of both the wave momentum flux in the mean angular momentum
equation and the wave heat flux in the mean entropy equation as well as their
interplay with the meridional circulation.
  In radiative layers of evolved low-mass stars, the quasi-adiabatic
approximation, the limit of slow rotation, and the asymptotic regime can be
applied for mixed modes and enable us to establish a prescription for the wave
fluxes in the mean equations. The formalism is finally applied to a $1.3
M_\odot$ benchmark model, representative of observed CoRoT and \emph{Kepler}
oscillating evolved stars.
  We show that the influence of the wave heat flux on the mean angular momentum
is not negligible and that the overall effect of mixed modes is to extract
angular momentum from the innermost region of the star. A quantitative and
accurate estimate requires realistic values of mode amplitudes. This is
provided in a companion paper.

inclination when fitting the two observations since these parameters should
remain constant across all states. This allows for the most accurate
determination of the spin parameter of this galactic black hole binary from
fitting the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line and provides a chance to test previous

structure of evolved low-mass stars. In particular, the measurement of the mean
core rotation rate as a function of the evolution places stringent constraints
on the physical mechanisms responsible for the angular momentum redistribution
in stars. It showed that the current stellar evolution codes including the
modelling of rotation fail to reproduce the observations. An additional
physical process that efficiently extracts angular momentum from the core is
thus necessary.
  Our aim is to assess the ability of mixed modes to do this. To this end, we
developed a formalism that provides a modelling of the wave fluxes in both the
mean angular momentum and the mean energy equations in a companion paper. In
this article, mode amplitudes are modelled based on recent asteroseismic
observations, and a quantitative estimate of the angular momentum transfer is
obtained. This is performed for a benchmark model of 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ at three
evolutionary stages, representative of the evolved pulsating stars observed by
CoRoT and Kepler.
  We show that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the innermost regions
of subgiants and red giants. However, this transport of angular momentum from
the core is unlikely to counterbalance the effect of the core contraction in
subgiants and early red giants. In contrast, for more evolved red giants, mixed
modes are found efficient enough to balance and exceed the effect of the core
contraction, in particular in the hydrogen-burning shell. Our results thus
indicate that mixed modes are a promising candidate to explain the observed
spin-down of the core of evolved red giants, but that an other mechanism is to
be invoked for subgiants and early red giants.

$\mathrm{Wit} (L,W)$ is defined from two sets $L$ and $W$ in some metric space
$X$: a finite set of points $L$ on which the complex is built, and a set $W$ of
witnesses that serves as an approximation of $X$. A fundamental result of de
Silva states that $\mathrm{Wit}(L,W)=\mathrm{Del} (L)$ if $W=X=\mathbb{R}^d$.
In this paper, we give conditions on $L$ that ensure that the witness complex
and the Delaunay triangulation coincide when $W$ is a finite set, and we
introduce a new perturbation scheme to compute a perturbed set $L'$ close to
$L$ such that $\mathrm{Del} (L')= \mathrm{wit} (L', W)$. Our perturbation
algorithm is a geometric application of the Moser-Tardos constructive proof of
the Lov\'asz local lemma. The only numerical operations we use are (squared)
distance comparisons (i.e., predicates of degree 2). The time-complexity of the
algorithm is sublinear in $|W|$. Interestingly, although the algorithm does not
compute any measure of simplex quality, a lower bound on the thickness of the
output simplices can be guaranteed.

geometric and non-geometric fluxes. For such structures we apply the
mathematical result that any Courant algebroid gives rise to a 3D topological
sigma model of the AKSZ type and we discuss the corresponding 2D field
theories. It is found that these models are always geometric, even when both
2-form and 2-vector fields are neither vanishing nor inverse of one another.
Taking a further step, we suggest an extended class of 3D sigma models, whose
world volume is embedded in phase space, which allow for genuinely
non-geometric backgrounds. Adopting the doubled formalism such models can be
related to double field theory, albeit from a world sheet perspective.

three types of network sampling techniques used to contact individuals in
hard-to-reach populations. This paper studies these procedures as a Markov
process on the social network that is indexed by a tree. Each node in this tree
corresponds to an observation and each edge in the tree corresponds to a
referral. Indexing with a tree (instead of a chain) allows for the sampled
units to refer multiple future units into the sample. In survey sampling, the
design effect characterizes the additional variance induced by a novel sampling
strategy. If the design effect is some value $DE$, then constructing an
estimator from the novel design makes the variance of the estimator $DE$ times
greater than it would be under a simple random sample with the same sample size
$n$. Under certain assumptions on the referral tree, the design effect of
network sampling has a critical threshold that is a function of the referral
rate $m$ and the clustering structure in the social network, represented by the
second eigenvalue of the Markov transition matrix, $\lambda_2$. If $m <
1/\lambda_2^2$, then the design effect is finite (i.e. the standard estimator
is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent). However, if $m > 1/\lambda_2^2$, then the design
effect grows with $n$ (i.e. the standard estimator is no longer
$\sqrt{n}$-consistent). Past this critical threshold, the standard error of the
estimator converges at the slower rate of $n^{\log_m \lambda_2}$. The Markov
model allows for nodes to be resampled; computational results show that the
findings hold in without-replacement sampling. To estimate confidence intervals
that adapt to the correct level of uncertainty, a novel resampling procedure is
proposed. Computational experiments compare this procedure to previous
techniques.

properties: a large star formation rate, some of the most massive young star

molecular gas. In this paper, I use SPH simulations to show that most of these
properties can be explained as due to a recent outburst of AGN activity in Sgr
A*, the central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way. In particular, the
narrow ring of dense gas, massive gas clouds, young star clusters and an
elevated SFR can all be caused by the passage of an AGN outflow through the
system, which compresses the gas and triggers fragmentation. Furthermore, I
show that the asymmetric distribution of gas, as observed in the CMZ, can be
produced by outflow-induced instabilities from an initially axisymmetric gas
disc. Angular momentum mixing in the disc produces some low angular momentum
material, which can subsequently feed Sgr A*. These processes can occur in any
galaxy that experiences an AGN episode, leading to bursts of nuclear star
formation much stronger than pure bar-driven mass inflows would predict.

disordered nanoporous medium after the complete filling at excess pressure and
the subsequent removal of excess pressure has been studied. It has been found
that three stages can be identified in the relaxation of the L23-water system
under study. At the first stage, a portion of water at the removal of excess
pressure rapidly flows out in the pressure reduction time, i.e., following a
decrease in the pressure. It has been shown that, at temperatures below the
dispersion transition temperature $T < T_d = 284 K$, e.g., $T = 277 K$, the
degree of filling ${\theta}$ decreases from 1 to 0.8 in 10 s, following the
variation of excess pressure. At the second stage of relaxation, the degree of
filling ${\theta}$ varies slowly according to a power law ${\theta} \sim
t^{-\alpha}$ with the exponent ${\alpha} < 0.1$ in the time $t \sim 10^5$ s.
This corresponds to a slow relaxation of the formed metastable state of the
nonwetting liquid in the porous medium. At the third stage when $t > 10^5$ s,
the formed metastable state decays, which is manifested in the transition to a
power-law dependence ${\theta}(t)$ with a larger exponent. The extrusion-time
distribution function of pores has been calculated along with the time
dependence of the degree of filling, which qualitatively describes the observed
anomalously slow relaxation and crossover of the transition to the stage of
decay with a power-law dependence ${\theta}(t)$ with a larger exponent. It has
been shown that the relaxation and decay of the metastable state of the
confined nonwetting liquid at ${\theta}>{\theta_c}$ are attributed to the
appearance of local configurations of liquid clusters in confinement and their
interaction inside the infinite percolation cluster of filled pores.

the formation and evolution of the droplet arrangement. As compared with their

dynamical distribution functions by maximizing a path entropy subject to

to standard near-equilibrium results -including the Green-Kubo relations,
Onsager's reciprocal relations of coupled flows, and Prigogine's principle of
minimum entropy production -in a way that is particularly simple. More
importantly, because Max Cal does not require any notion of 'local
equilibrium', or any notion of entropy dissipation, or even any restriction to
material physics, it is more general than many traditional approaches. We
develop some generalizations of the Onsager and Prigogine results that apply
arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Max Cal is not limited to materials and
fluids; it also applies, for example, to flows and trafficking on networks more
broadly.

that stars be continuously supplied to the binary, and it is known that in
spherical galaxies the reservoir of such stars is quickly depleted, leading to
stalling of the binary at parsec-scale separations. Recent N-body simulations
of galaxy mergers and isolated nonspherical galaxies suggest that this stalling
may not occur in less idealized systems. However, it remains unclear to what
degree these conclusions are affected by collisional relaxation, which is much
stronger in the numerical simulations than in real galaxies. In this study, we
present a novel Monte Carlo method that can efficiently deal with both
collisional and collisionless dynamics, and with galaxy models having arbitrary
shapes. We show that without relaxation, the final-parsec problem may be
overcome only in triaxial galaxies. Axisymmetry is not enough, but even a
moderate departure from axisymmetry is sufficient to keep the binary shrinking.
We find that the binary hardening rate is always substantially lower than the
maximum possible, ""full-loss-cone"" rate, and that it decreases with time, but
that stellar-dynamical interactions are nevertheless able to drive the binary
to coalescence on a timescale <=1 Gyr in any triaxial galaxy.

reduce the highly non-trivial problems of coding over analog channels and
compressing analog sources to a set of much simpler subproblems, coding over
discrete channels and compressing discrete sources. More specifically, the
focus of this paper is on the additive exponential noise (AEN) channel, and
lossy compression of exponential sources. Taking advantage of the essential
decomposable property of these channels (sources), the proposed expansion
method allows for mapping of these problems to coding over parallel channels
(respectively, sources), where each level is modeled as an independent coding
problem over discrete alphabets. Any feasible solution to the resulting
optimization problem after expansion corresponds to an achievable scheme of the
original problem. Utilizing this mapping, even for the cases where the optimal
solutions are difficult to characterize, it is shown that the expansion coding
scheme still performs well with appropriate choices of parameters. More
specifically, theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal that expansion
coding achieves the capacity of AEN channel in the high SNR regime. It is also
shown that for lossy compression, the achievable rate distortion pair by
expansion coding approaches to the Shannon limit in the low distortion region.
Remarkably, by using capacity-achieving codes with low encoding and decoding
complexity that are originally designed for discrete alphabets, for instance
polar codes, the proposed expansion coding scheme allows for designing
low-complexity analog channel and source codes.

""critical slowing down"", as the relaxation time diverges when <q> tends to

power-law relaxation (1/t^2). Below the threshold, a long-lasting transient

pin down the cosmological model and for studies of galaxy evolution. In this
study, a novel sparse regression framework for photometric redshift estimation
is presented. Simulated and real data from SDSS DR12 were used to train and
test the proposed models. We show that approaches which include careful data
preparation and model design offer a significant improvement in comparison with
several competing machine learning algorithms. Standard implementations of most
regression algorithms have as the objective the minimization of the sum of
squared errors. For redshift inference, however, this induces a bias in the
posterior mean of the output distribution, which can be problematic. In this
paper we directly target minimizing $\Delta z = (z_\textrm{s} -
z_\textrm{p})/(1+z_\textrm{s})$ and address the bias problem via a
distribution-based weighting scheme, incorporated as part of the optimization
objective. The results are compared with other machine learning algorithms in
the field such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gaussian Processes (GPs)
and sparse GPs. The proposed framework reaches a mean absolute $\Delta z =
0.0026(1+z_\textrm{s})$, over the redshift range of $0 \le z_\textrm{s} \le 2$
on the simulated data, and $\Delta z = 0.0178(1+z_\textrm{s})$ over the entire
redshift range on the SDSS DR12 survey, outperforming the standard ANNz used in
the literature. We also investigate how the relative size of the training set
affects the photometric redshift accuracy. We find that a training set of
\textgreater 30 per cent of total sample size, provides little additional
constraint on the photometric redshifts, and note that our GP formalism
strongly outperforms ANNz in the sparse data regime for the simulated data set.

intensity to states above the neutron separation energy followed by gamma-ray
emission in 87,88Br and 94Rb. Accurate results were obtained thanks to a
careful control of systematic errors. An unexpectedly large gamma intensity was
observed in all three cases extending well beyond the excitation energy region
where neutron penetration is hindered by low neutron energy. The gamma
branching as a function of excitation energy was compared to Hauser-Feshbach
model calculations. For 87Br and 88Br the gamma branching reaches 57% and 20%
respectively, and could be explained as a nuclear structure effect. Some of the
states populated in the daughter can only decay through the emission of a large
orbital angular momentum neutron with a strongly reduced barrier penetrability.
In the case of neutron-rich 94Rb the observed 4.5% branching is much larger
than the calculations performed with standard nuclear statistical model
parameters, even after proper correction for fluctuation effects on individual
transition widths. The difference can be reconciled introducing an enhancement
of one order-of-magnitude in the photon strength to neutron strength ratio. An
increase in the photon strength function of such magnitude for very
neutron-rich nuclei, if it proved to be correct, leads to a similar increase in
the (n,gamma) cross section that would have an impact on r-process abundance
calculations.

a semi-convective staircase -- in which small convective regions are separated
by sharp density jumps -- supports internal gravity waves (g-modes). When the
wavelength is much longer than the distance between semi-convective steps,
these behave nearly like g-modes in a continuously stratified medium. However,
the g-mode period spacing in a semi-convective region is systematically {\em
smaller} than in a continuously stratified medium, and it decreases with
decreasing mode frequency. When the g-mode wavelength becomes comparable to the
distance between semi-convective steps, the g-mode frequencies deviate
significantly from those of a continuously stratified medium (the frequencies
are higher). G-modes with vertical wavelengths smaller than the distance
between semi-convective steps are evanescent and do not propagate in the
staircase. Thus, there is a lower cutoff frequency for a given horizontal
wavenumber. We generalize our results to gravito-inertial waves relevant for
rapidly rotating stars and planets. Finally, we assess the prospects for
detecting layered semi-convection using astero/planetary seismology.

proved to be very elusive, and escaped direct detection in radio surveys so
far. High redshift blazars themselves seem to be failing in producing extended
radio-lobes, raising questions about the connection between such class and the
vaster population of radio-galaxies. We show that the interaction of the jet

the lack of extended radio emission in high redshift blazars and in their
parent population, helping to explain the apparently missing misaligned
counterparts of high redshift blazars. On the other hand, the emission from the
more compact and more magnetised hot spots are less affected by the enhanced
CMB energy density. By modelling the spectral energy distribution of blazar
lobes and hot spots we find that most of them should be detectable by low
frequency deep radio observations, e.g., by LOw-Frequency ARray for radio
astronomy (LOFAR) and by relatively deep X-ray observations with good angular
resolution, e.g., by the Chandra satellite. At high redshifts, the emission of
a misaligned relativistic jet, being de-beamed, is missed by current large sky
area surveys. The isotropic flux produced in the hot spots can be below ~1 mJy

Consequently, even sources with very powerful jets can go undetected in current

that planets may survive and become misaligned from their host binary, or may

~5-degree diameter ""plate"" that is observed, we can use the stellar parameters
of the observed stars to account for the stellar luminosity function and target
selection effects. This removes biasing assumptions about the underlying
populations, both due to predictions of the luminosity function from stellar
evolution modeling, and from Galactic models of stellar populations along each
line of sight. Using calibration data of stars with known distances and stellar
parameters, we show that our method recovers distances for most stars within
~20%, but with some systematic overestimation of distances to halo giants. We
apply our code to the LAMOST database, and show that the current precision of
LAMOST stellar parameters permits measurements of distances with ~40% error
bars. This precision should improve as the LAMOST data pipelines continue to be
refined.

Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and the rotation curves and stellar velocity
dispersion profiles measured by the DiskMass Survey. A bulge-disk decomposition
was made for each of the thirty published galaxies, and a MOND Poisson solver
was used to simultaneously compute, from the baryonic mass distributions, model
rotation curves and vertical velocity dispersion profiles, which were compared
to the measured values. The two main free parameters, the stellar disk's
mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) and its exponential scale-height ($h_z$), were
estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo modelling. The average best-fit K-band
stellar mass-to-light ratio was $M/L \simeq 0.55 \pm 0.15$. However, to match
the DiskMass Survey data, the vertical scale-heights would have to be in the
range $h_z=200$ to $400$ pc which is a factor of two lower than those derived
from observations of edge-on galaxies with a similar scale-length. The reason
is that modified gravity versions of MOND characteristically require a larger
$M/L$ to fit the rotation curve in the absence of dark matter and therefore
predict a stronger vertical gravitational field than Newtonian models. It was
found that changing the MOND acceleration parameter, the shape of the velocity
dispersion ellipsoid, the adopted vertical distribution of stars, as well as
the galaxy inclination, within any realistic range, all had little impact on
these results.

radio bursts (FRBs) based on very young pulsars in supernova remnants. Within a
few hundred years of a core-collapse supernova the ejecta is confined within
$\sim$1 pc, providing a high enough column density of free electrons for the
observed 375-1600 pc cm$^{-3}$ of dispersion measure (DM). By extrapolating a
Crab-like pulsar to its infancy in an environment like that of SN 1987A, we
hypothesize such an object could emit supergiant pulses sporadically which
would be bright enough to be seen at a few hundred megaparsecs. We hypothesize
that such supergiant pulses would preferentially occur early in the pulsar's
life when the free electron density is still high, which is why we do not see
large numbers of moderate DM FRBs ($\lesssim300$ pc cm$^{-3}$). In this
scenario Faraday rotation at the source gives rotation measures (RMs) much
larger than the expected cosmological contribution. If the emission were
pulsar-like, then the polarization vector could swing over the duration of the
burst, which is not expected from non-rotating objects. In this model, the
scattering, large DM, and commensurate RM all come from one place which is not
the case for the cosmological interpretation. The model also provides testable
predictions of the flux distribution and repeat rate of FRBs, and could be
further verified by spatial coincidence with optical supernovae of the past
several decades and cross-correlation with nearby galaxy maps.

does in long-duration GRB models. For typical short-duration GRB central engine
parameters, we find jets with opening angles of order 10 degrees in which a

the non-Markovian behavior lies in the initial state of the field, prepared as

increasing distance from the center of NGC 1705. This suggests that the
strongest starburst located within the central $\sim$150 pc is responsible for
the ionization of the gas out to at least $\sim$1 kpc. The gradual dilution of
the radiation with increasing distance from the center reflects the gradual and
continuous transition from the highly ionized H II regions in the proximity of
the major starburst into the diffuse ionized gas.

some advanced cognitive tasks require spiking neuromorphic networks, which
explicitly model individual neural pulses (spikes) in biological neural

spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is believed to be the primary
mechanism of Hebbian adaptation. A major challenge for the STDP implementation
is that, in contrast to some simplistic models of the plasticity, the
elementary change of a synaptic weight in an artificial hardware synapse
depends not only on the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic signals, but also on the
initial weight (memristor's conductance) value. Here we experimentally
demonstrate, for the first time, STDP protocols that ensure self-adaptation of
the average memristor conductance, making the plasticity stable, i.e.
insensitive to the initial state of the devices. The experiments have been
carried out with 200-nm Al2O3/TiO2-x memristors integrated into 12x12

complemented with numerical modeling of weight dynamics in a simple system with

relationships connecting quark-level QCD correlation functions to mesonic-level
two-point functions. Crucial ingredients of this connection are scale factor
matrices relating each distinct quark-level substructure (e.g.,
quark-antiquark, four-quark) to its mesonic counterpart. The scale factors and
mixing angles are combined into a projection matrix to obtain the physical
(hadronic) projection of the QCD correlation function matrix. Such
relationships provide a powerful bridge between chiral Lagrangians and QCD
sum-rules that are particularly effective in studies of the substructure of
light scalar mesons with multiple complicated resonance shapes and substantial
underlying mixings. The validity of these connections is demonstrated for the
example of the isotriplet $a_0(980)$-$a_0(1450)$ system, resulting in an
unambiguous determination of the scale factors from the combined inputs of QCD
sum-rules and chiral Lagrangians. These scale factors lead to a remarkable
agreement between the quark condensates in QCD and the mesonic vacuum
expectation values that induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in chiral
Lagrangians. This concrete example shows a clear sensitivity to the underlying
$a_0$-system mixing angle, illustrating the value of this methodology in
extensions to more complicated mesonic systems.

Approximately 450 kpc south-south west of the SW subcluster, we detect a

important problem involved in training deep networks-- \textit{Internal
Covariate Shift}-- the current solution has certain drawbacks. For instance, BN
depends on batch statistics for layerwise input normalization during training
which makes the estimates of mean and standard deviation of input
(distribution) to hidden layers inaccurate due to shifting parameter values
(especially during initial training epochs). Another fundamental problem with
BN is that it cannot be used with batch-size $ 1 $ during training. We address
these drawbacks of BN by proposing a non-adaptive normalization technique for
removing covariate shift, that we call \textit{Normalization Propagation}. Our
approach does not depend on batch statistics, but rather uses a
data-independent parametric estimate of mean and standard-deviation in every
layer thus being computationally faster compared with BN. We exploit the
observation that the pre-activation before Rectified Linear Units follow
Gaussian distribution in deep networks, and that once the first and second
order statistics of any given dataset are normalized, we can forward propagate
this normalization without the need for recalculating the approximate
statistics for hidden layers.

indirect measurement of the cantilever displacement, since it is fundamentally
an angular rather than a displacement measurement. Here, we demonstrate a
metrological AFM that combines an OBD sensor with a laser Doppler vibrometer

Solar-System evolution. The uniqueness of the spectrum suggests that we are
either catching SVS13 in a short-lived evolutionary phase and/or that there is
something special about SVS13 itself that makes it rare amongst young stars. We
speculate on the physical origin of the respective dust species and why they
are all simultaneously present toward SVS13. Two scenarios are presented: a
disc-instability-induced fragmentation, with subsequent localised heating and
orbital evolution firstly annealing initially amorphous silicates and then
dispersing their crystalline products throughout a circumstellar disc; and a
newly discovered shock-heating mechanism at the interface between the

the generalization of acoustic impedance to non linear dispersions using the

energy. For a single junction, we find that for coherent and incoherent phonons
the optimal thermal conductance occurs when the matching $\Gamma(\omega)$
equals the Geometric Mean (GM) of the contact broadenings. This criteria favors
the transmission of both low and high frequency phonons by requiring that (1)
the low frequency acoustic impedance of the junction matches that of the two
contacts by minimizing the sum of interfacial resistances; and (2) the cut-off
frequency is near the minimum of the two contacts, thereby reducing the
spillage of the states into the tunneling regime. For an ultimately scaled
single atom/spring junction, the matching criteria transforms to the arithmetic
mean for mass and the harmonic mean for spring constant. The matching can be
further improved using a composite graded junction with an exponential varying
broadening that functions like a broadband antireflection coating. There is
however a trade off as the increased length of the interface brings in
additional intrinsic sources of scattering.

Multiple atmospheric models are employed in the inversions, as superpenumbral

symmetry breaking effects of the radiation field incident on the chromospheric

suggests fibrils are not concentrations of magnetic flux but rather
distinguished by individualized thermalization. We also directly compare our
inverted values with a current-free extrapolation of the chromospheric field.

numbers, and then correctly rounding to the nearest floating-point number.
Higher accuracy than simple summation (rounding after each addition) is
important in many applications, such as finding the sample mean of data. Exact
summation also guarantees identical results with parallel and serial
implementations, since the exact sum is independent of order. The new methods
use variations on the concept of a ""superaccumulator"" - a large fixed-point
number that can exactly represent the sum of any reasonable number of
floating-point values. One method uses a ""small"" superaccumulator with
sixty-seven 64-bit chunks, each with 32-bit overlap with the next chunk,
allowing carry propagation to be done infrequently. The small superaccumulator
is used alone when summing a small number of terms. For big summations, a
""large"" superaccumulator is used as well. It consists of 4096 64-bit chunks,
one for every possible combination of exponent bits and sign bit, plus counts
of when each chunk needs to be transferred to the small superaccumulator. To
add a term to the large superaccumulator, only a single chunk and its
associated count need to be updated, which takes very few instructions if
carefully implemented. On modern 64-bit processors, exactly summing a large
array using this combination of large and small superaccumulators takes less
than twice the time of simple, inexact, ordered summation, with a serial
implementation. A parallel implementation using a small number of processor
cores can be expected to perform exact summation of large arrays at a speed
that reaches the limit imposed by memory bandwidth. Some common methods that
attempt to improve accuracy without being exact may therefore be pointless, at
least for large summations, since they are slower than computing the sum
exactly.

imaginary axis Green's function does not give direct access to the desired
quasiparticle spectra, which undermines its utility. To this end we investigate
how reliably one can calculate quasiparticle spectra from the Extended
Koopmans' Theorem (EKT) applied to the imaginary time Green's function in a
second order approximation (GF2). We find that EKT in conjunction with GF2
yields IPs and EAs that systematically underestimate experimental and accurate
coupled-cluster reference values for a variety of molecules and atoms. This
establishes that the EKT allows one to utilize the computational advantages of
an imaginary axis implementation, while still being able to acquire real axis
spectral properties. Because the EKT requires negligible computational effort,
and can be used with a Green's function from any level of theory, we conclude
that it is a potentially very useful tool for the systematic study of
quasiparticle spectra in realistic systems.

of equilibrium when a time periodic perturbation is applied. In these systems
one can define quasi-energy states which replace the quilibrium stationary
states. The system exhibits its non-trivial topology by developing edge
localized quasi-energy states which lie in a gap of the quasi energy spectrum.
These states represent a non-equilibrium analogue of the topologically
protected edge-states in equilibrium topological insulators. In equilibrium
these edge-states lead to very specific transport properties, in particular the
two-terminal conductivity of these systems is $2e^2/h$. Here we explore the
transport properties of the edge-states in a Floquet topological insulator. In
stark contrast to the equilibrium result, we find that the two terminal
conductivity of these edge states is significantly different from $2e^2/h$.
This fact notwithstanding, we find that for certain external potential
strengths the conductivity is smaller than $2e^2/h$ and robust to the effects
of disorder and smooth changes to the Hamiltonian's parameters. This robustness
is reminiscent of the robustness found in equilibrium topological insulators.
We provide an intuitive understanding of the reduction of the conductivity in
terms of scattering by photons. This leads us to consider a previously proposed
Floquet sum rule which recovers the equilibrium value of $2e^2/h$ for the
conductivity when edge states are present. We show that this sum rule holds in
our system using both numerical and analytic techniques.

this expression to derive, in a closed form, the DRF of several cyclostationary

this problem involves source coding applied to a signal with the same structure
as one resulting from pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). Since a PAM-modulated
signal is cyclostationary, our DRF expression can be used to solve for the
minimal distortion in the combined sampling and source coding problem. We also
analyze in more detail the DRF of a source with the same structure as a
PAM-modulated signal, and show that it is obtained by reverse waterfilling over
an expression that depends on the energy of the pulse and the baseband process
modulated to obtain the PAM signal. This result is then used to study the
information content of a PAM-modulated signal as a function of its symbol time
relative to the bandwidth of the underlying baseband process. In addition, we
also study the DRF of sources with an amplitude-modulation structure, and show
that the DRF of a narrow-band Gaussian stationary process modulated by either a

computational geometry and computer graphics. However, except for some
theoretical results, such as existence and uniqueness, little progress has been
made towards computing IDT on simplicial surfaces. To date the only way for
constructing IDTs is the edge-flipping algorithm, which iteratively flips the
non-Delaunay edge to be locally Delaunay. Although the algorithm is
conceptually simple and guarantees to stop in finite steps, it has no known
time complexity. Moreover, the edge-flipping algorithm may produce non-regular
triangulations, which contain self-loops and/or faces with only two edges. In
this paper, we propose a new method for constructing IDT on manifold triangle
meshes. Based on the duality of geodesic Voronoi diagrams, our method can
guarantee the resultant IDTs are regular. Our method has a theoretical
worst-case time complexity $O(n^2\log n)$ for a mesh with $n$ vertices. We
observe that most real-world models are far from their Delaunay triangulations,
thus, the edge-flipping algorithm takes many iterations to fix the non-Delaunay
edges. In contrast, our method is non-iterative and insensitive to the number
of non-Delaunay edges. Empirically, it runs in linear time $O(n)$ on real-world
models.

graph. The first is distance preservers, which are sparse subgraphs that agree
with the distances of the original graph on a given set of demand pairs. Prior
work on distance preservers has exploited only a simple structural property of
shortest paths, called consistency, stating that one can break shortest path
ties such that no two paths intersect, split apart, and then intersect again
later. We prove that consistency alone is not enough to understand distance
preservers, by showing both a lower bound on the power of consistency and a new
general upper bound that polynomially surpasses it. Specifically, our new upper
bound is that any $p$ demand pairs in an $n$-node undirected unweighted graph
have a distance preserver on $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + np^{1/3})$ edges. We leave a
conjecture that the right bound is $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + n)$ or better.
  The second part of this paper leverages these distance preservers in a new
construction of additive spanners, which are subgraphs that preserve all
pairwise distances up to an additive error function. We give improved error
bounds for spanners with relatively few edges; for example, we prove that all
graphs have spanners on $O(n)$ edges with $+O(n^{3/7 + \varepsilon})$ error.
Our construction can be viewed as an extension of the popular path-buying
framework to clusters of larger radii.

functions for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process contain the product of two
parabolic cylinder functions, namely D_{v}(x)D_{v}(y) and D_{v}(x)D_{v-1}(y),
respectively. The inverse transforms of these products have as yet not been
documented. However, the transition density and distribution functions can be
obtained by alternatively applying Doob's transform to the Kolmogorov equation
and casting the problem in terms of Brownian motion. Linking the resulting
transition density and distribution functions to their Laplace transforms then
specifies the inverse transforms to the aforementioned products of parabolic
cylinder functions. These two results, the recurrence relation of the parabolic
cylinder function and the properties of the Laplace transform then enable the
calculation of inverse transforms also for countless other combinations in the
orders of the parabolic cylinder functions such as D_{v}(x)D_{v-2}(y),
D_{v+1}(x)D_{v-1}(y) and D_{v}(x)D_{v-3}(y).

random, charged porous media at high rates, above the diffusion-limited
current. After linear sweep voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, copper
electrodeposits are visualized by scanning electron microscopy and energy
dispersive spectroscopy in two different porous separators (cellulose nitrate,
polyethylene), whose surfaces are modified by layer-by-layer deposition of
positive or negative charged polyelectrolytes. Above the limiting current,
surface conduction inhibits growth in the positive separators and produces
irregular dendrites, while it enhances growth and suppresses dendrites behind a
deionization shock in the negative separators, also leading to improved cycle
life. The discovery of stable uniform growth in the random media differs from
the non-uniform growth observed in parallel nanopores and cannot be explained
by classical quasi-steady leaky membrane models, which always predict
instability and dendritic growth. Instead, the experimental results suggest
that transient electro-diffusion in random porous media imparts the stability
of a deionization shock to the growing metal interface behind it. Shock
electrodeposition could be exploited to enhance the cycle life and recharging
rate of metal batteries or to accelerate the fabrication of metal matrix
composite coatings.

distributed uniformly in comoving volume, with isotropic orientations. From
signals producing signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 5$ in at least two detectors, we
estimate the posterior distributions of the binary parameters using the
Bayesian parameter estimation code LALInference. The GW signals will be
redshifted due to the cosmological expansion and we measure only the
""redshifted"" masses. By assuming a cosmology, it is possible to estimate the
gravitational masses by inferring the redshift from the measured posterior of
the luminosity distance. We find that the measurement of the gravitational
masses will be in general dominated by the error in measuring the luminosity
distance. In spite of this, the component masses of more than $50\%$ of the
population can be measured with accuracy better than $\sim 25\%$ using the
Advanced LIGO-Virgo network. Additionally, the mass of the final black hole can
be measured with median accuracy $\sim 18\%$. Spin of the final black hole can
be measured with median accuracy $\sim 5\% ~(17\%)$ for binaries with
non-spinning (aligned-spin) black holes. Additional detectors in Japan and
India significantly improve the accuracy of sky localization, and moderately
improve the estimation of luminosity distance, and hence, that of all mass
parameters. We discuss the implication of these results on the observational
evidence of intermediate-mass black holes and the estimation of cosmological

  Methods. We recalculated the free-free Gaunt factor for a wide range of
energies and frequencies using hypergeometric functions of complex arguments
and the Clenshaw recurrence formula technique combined with approximations
whenever the difference between the initial and final electron energies is
smaller than $10^{-10}$ in units of $z^2Ry$. We used double and quadruple

insight into why we would want to exploit during periods of high reward, and
discuss the impact on regret. Our proposed methods perform well in experiments,

graph. The first is distance preservers, which are sparse subgraphs that agree
with the distances of the original graph on a given set of demand pairs. Prior
work on distance preservers has exploited only a simple structural property of
shortest paths, called consistency, stating that one can break shortest path
ties such that no two paths intersect, split apart, and then intersect again
later. We prove that consistency alone is not enough to understand distance
preservers, by showing both a lower bound on the power of consistency and a new
general upper bound that polynomially surpasses it. Specifically, our new upper
bound is that any $p$ demand pairs in an $n$-node undirected unweighted graph
have a distance preserver on $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + np^{1/3})$ edges. We leave a
conjecture that the right bound is $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + n)$ or better.
  The second part of this paper leverages these distance preservers in a new
construction of additive spanners, which are subgraphs that preserve all
pairwise distances up to an additive error function. We give improved error
bounds for spanners with relatively few edges; for example, we prove that all
graphs have spanners on $O(n)$ edges with $+O(n^{3/7 + \varepsilon})$ error.
Our construction can be viewed as an extension of the popular path-buying
framework to clusters of larger radii.

adversarially. This model, first considered by Preparata, Metze, and Chien in

\emph{all} corrupt (that is, faulty) vertices can be identified, when there is
a known upper bound on their number.
  We are interested in networks in which the identity of a \emph{large

when their number is $t$, all indegrees have to be at least $t$. In contrast,
we show that in $d$ regular-graphs with strong expansion properties, a
$1-O(1/d)$ fraction of the corrupt vertices, and a $1-O(1/d)$ fraction of the
truthful vertices can be identified, whenever there is a majority of truthful
vertices. We also observe that if the graph is very far from being a good
expander, namely, if the deletion of a small set of vertices splits the graph
into small components, then no corruption detection is possible even if most of
the vertices are truthful. Finally, we discuss the algorithmic aspects and the

change scenarios, and land use change models with species distribution models.
Future land use scenarios were modelled by initially calculating the rate of
current land use changes between two time snapshots (2000 and 2006) on the
island, and based on these transition probabilities markov-chain cellular
automata were used to generate future land use changes for 2050. Climate change
scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and B2A were derived from the IPCC reports. Species
climatic preferences were derived from their current distributions using
classification trees while habitats preferences were derived from the Red Data
Book of the Flora of Cyprus. A bioclimatic model for Crocus cyprius was built
using mean temperature of wettest quarter, max temperature of warmest month and
precipitation seasonality, while for Ophrys kotchyi the bioclimatic model was
built using precipitation of wettest month, mean temperature of warmest
quarter, isothermality, precipitation of coldest quarter, and annual
precipitation. Sequentially, simulation scenarios were performed regarding
future species distributions by accounting climate alone and both climate and
land use changes. The distribution of the two species resulting from the
bioclimatic models was then filtered by future land use changes, providing the
species projected potential distribution. The species projected potential
distribution varies depending on the type and scenario used, but many of both
species current sites/locations are projected to be outside their future
potential distribution. Our results demonstrate the importance of including
both land use and climatic changes in predictive species modeling.

The method is versatile and can be applied to study a large class of nuclear

the quadrupole moment and eventually higher-order multipole moments, the
associated collective masses are estimated along the microscopic mean-field

that the off-diagonal matrix elements of the inertia play a crucial role. Using
the information on the quadrupole moment and associated momentum, the

together for longer time leading to a dynamical scission point at larger
distance between nuclei compared to the one anticipated from the adiabatic
energy landscape. The effective nucleus-nucleus potential felt by the emitted

the presence of a complex magnetic topology with two different kinds of coronal

streamer are coronal structures which separate coronal holes of the same
polarity, without a current sheet in the outer corona; unlike bipolar streamer
that separate coronal holes of opposite magnetic polarity. In this study, two
examples of these structures have been identified in the period of Carrington

the photospheric field measurements. We present a spectroscopic analysis of a
pseudo-streamer and a bipolar streamer observed in the period 12-17 March 2008

temperature, electron density and outflow velocity, are inferred in the
extended corona (from 1.7 to 2.1 Rsun) analysing the O VI doublet and Ly alpha

  The coronal magnetic topology is taken into account and has been extrapolated

found higher kinetic temperature and higher outflow velocities of O VI ions and
lower electron density values. In conclusion, we point out that
pseudo-streamers produce a ""hybrid"" type of outflow that is intermediate
between slow and fast solar wind and they are a possible source of slow/fast

$\Sigma$ the over density of radio sources around spectroscopically confirmed
quasars. $\Sigma$ is related to the space density of radio sources at the
distance of the quasars and the clustering strength between the two samples,
hence knowledge of one constrains the other. Under simple assumptions we find
$\Phi\propto (1+z)^{3.7\pm0.7}$ out to $z\sim2$. Above this redshift the
evolution slows and we constrain the evolution exponent to $<1.01$ ($2\sigma$).
This behaviour is almost identical to that found by previous authors for the
bright end of the RLF potentially indicating that we are looking at the same
population. This suggests that the NVSS is dominated by a single population;
most likely radio sources associated with high-excitation cold-mode accretion.
Inversely, by adopting a previously modelled RLF we can constrain the
clustering of high-redshift radio sources and find a clustering strength
consistent with $r_0=15.0\pm 2.5$ Mpc up to $z\sim3.5$. This is inconsistent
with quasars at low redshift and some measurements of the clustering of bright

because tweets that report interesting events are overwhelmed by a large volume
of tweets on unrelated topics. Existing methods focus on the textual content of
tweets and ignore the social aspect of Twitter. In this paper we propose MABED
(i.e. mention-anomaly-based event detection), a novel statistical method that
relies solely on tweets and leverages the creation frequency of dynamic links
(i.e. mentions) that users insert in tweets to detect significant events and
estimate the magnitude of their impact over the crowd. MABED also differs from
the literature in that it dynamically estimates the period of time during which
each event is discussed, rather than assuming a predefined fixed duration for
all events. The experiments we conducted on both English and French Twitter
data show that the mention-anomaly-based approach leads to more accurate event
detection and improved robustness in presence of noisy Twitter content.
Qualitatively speaking, we find that MABED helps with the interpretation of
detected events by providing clear textual descriptions and precise temporal
descriptions. We also show how MABED can help understanding users' interest.
Furthermore, we describe three visualizations designed to favor an efficient

to be unrealistically large approaching the dislocation core, due to the
singular nature of the theory. While in many cases this is remedied with the
approximation of an effective core radius, inside which ad hoc regularizations
are implemented, such approximations lead to a compromise in the accuracy of
the calculations. In this work, an anisotropic non-singular elastic
representation of dislocation fields is developed to accurately represent the
near-core stresses of dislocations in $\alpha$-iron. The regularized stress
field is enabled through the use of a non-singular Green's tensor function of
Helmholtz-type gradient anisotropic elasticity, which requires only a single
characteristic length parameter in addition to the material's elastic
constants. Using a novel magnetic bond-order potential to model atomic
interactions in iron, molecular statics calculations are performed, and an
optimization procedure is developed to extract the required length parameter.
Results show the method can accurately replicate the magnitude and decay of the
near-core dislocation stresses even for atoms belonging to the core itself.
Comparisons with the singular isotropic and anisotropic theories show the
non-singular anisotropic theory leads to a substantially more accurate
representation of the stresses of both screw and edge dislocations near the
core, in some cases showing improvements in accuracy of up to an order of
magnitude. The spatial extent of the region in which the singular and
non-singular stress differ substantially is also discussed. The general
procedure we describe may in principle be applied to accurately model the
near-core dislocation stresses of any arbitrarily shaped dislocation in
anisotropic cubic media.

magnetohydrodynamic turbulence mediated by the magnetorotational instability.
Despite an abundant literature on the MRI, the parameters governing the
saturation amplitude of the turbulence are poorly understood and the existence
of an asymptotic behavior in the Ohmic diffusion regime is not clearly
established. We investigate the properties of the turbulent state in the small
magnetic Prandtl number limit. Since this is extremely computationally
expensive, we also study the relevance and range of applicability of the most
common subgrid scale models for this problem. Unstratified shearing boxes
simulations are performed both in the compressible and incompressible limits,
with a resolution up to 800 cells per disc scale height. The latter constitutes
the largest resolution ever attained for a simulation of MRI turbulence. In the
presence of a mean magnetic field threading the domain, angular momentum
transport converges to a finite value in the small Pm limit. When the mean
vertical field amplitude is such that {\beta}, the ratio between the thermal
and magnetic pressure, equals 1000, we find {\alpha}~0.032 when Pm approaches
zero. In the case of a mean toroidal field for which {\beta}=100, we find
{\alpha}~0.018 in the same limit. Both implicit LES and Chollet-Lesieur closure
model reproduces these results for the {\alpha} parameter and the power
spectra. A reduction in computational cost of a factor at least 16 (and up to
256) is achieved when using such methods. MRI turbulence operates efficiently

  subject to a strong magnetic field","Journal of Fluid Mechanics, in press",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the behavior of flows, including turbulent flows, driven by a
horizontal body-force and subject to a vertical magnetic field, with the
following question in mind: for very strong applied magnetic field, is the flow
mostly two-dimensional, with remaining weak three-dimensional fluctuations, or
does it become exactly 2D, with no dependence along the vertical?
  We first focus on the quasi-static approximation, i.e. the asymptotic limit
of vanishing magnetic Reynolds number Rm << 1: we prove that the flow becomes
exactly 2D asymptotically in time, regardless of the initial condition and
provided the interaction parameter N is larger than a threshold value. We call
this property ""absolute two-dimensionalization"": the attractor of the system is
necessarily a (possibly turbulent) 2D flow.
  We then consider the full-magnetohydrodynamic equations and we prove that,
for low enough Rm and large enough N, the flow becomes exactly two-dimensional
in the long-time limit provided the initial vertically-dependent perturbations
are infinitesimal. We call this phenomenon ""linear two-dimensionalization"": the
(possibly turbulent) 2D flow is an attractor of the dynamics, but it is not
necessarily the only attractor of the system. Some 3D attractors may also exist
and be attained for strong enough initial 3D perturbations.
  These results shed some light on the existence of a dissipation anomaly for
magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to a strong external magnetic field.

forest growth and harvest are priced with an increasing price. Such an
evolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient
climate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for
enhanced carbon sequestration. With an infinitely long sequence of even-aged
forest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due
to the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore
also involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and
allow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of
forest rotations.
  Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land,
the initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length
of the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters,
the optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is
released to the atmosphere upon harvest. This effect is not, however, entirely
monotonous. Consequently, the currently optimal harvest ages are generally
lower with higher rates of carbon price increase. This creates an interesting
temporal aspect, suggesting that the supply of wood and carbon sequestration by
forests can change considerably during subsequent rotations under an increasing
price on carbon.

interactions, in combination with modulations of tumor-associated vasculature,
are far from being completely understood. Here, we propose a mathematical model
of vascularized tumor growth, where the main novelty is the modeling of the
interplay between functional tumor vasculature and effector cell recruitment
dynamics. Parameters are calibrated on the basis of different in vivo
immunocompromised Rag1-/- and wild-type (WT) BALB/c murine tumor growth
experiments. The model analysis supports that tumor vasculature normalization
can be a plausible and effective strategy to treat cancer when combined with
appropriate immuno-stimulations. We find that improved levels of functional
tumor vasculature, potentially mediated by normalization or stress alleviation
strategies, can provide beneficial outcomes in terms of tumor burden reduction
and growth control. Normalization of tumor blood vessels opens a therapeutic
window of opportunity to augment the antitumor immune responses, as well as to
reduce the intratumoral immunosuppression and induced-hypoxia due to vascular
abnormalities. The potential success of normalizing tumor-associated
vasculature closely depends on the effector cell recruitment dynamics and tumor
sizes. Furthermore, an arbitrary increase of initial effector cell
concentration does not necessarily imply a better tumor control. We evidence
the existence of an optimal concentration range of effector cells for tumor
shrinkage. Based on these findings, we suggest a theory-driven therapeutic
proposal that optimally combines immuno- and vaso-modulatory interventions.

situations where the scalar field responsible for the modification of gravity
is coupled to a perfect fluid with pressure. We describe the coupled system at
both the background cosmology and cosmological perturbations levels, focusing
on cases where the pressure emanates from small-scale nonlinear physics. We
derive these properties in both the Einstein and Jordan frames, as these two
frames already differ by a few percents at the background level for K-mouflage
scenarios, and next compute cluster properties in the Jordan frame that is
better suited to these observations. Galaxy clusters are not screened by the
K-mouflage mechanism and therefore feel the modification of gravity in a
maximal way. This implies that the halo mass function deviates from
$\Lambda$-CDM by a factor of order one for masses $M\gtrsim 10^{14} \ h^{-1}
M_\odot$. We then consider the hydrostatic equilibrium of gases embedded in
galaxy clusters and the consequences of K-mouflage on the X-ray cluster
luminosity, the gas temperature, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find
that the cluster temperature function, and more generally number counts, are
largely affected by K-mouflage, mainly due to the increased cluster abundance
in these models. Other scaling relations such as the mass-temperature and the
temperature-luminosity relations are only modified at the percent level due to
the constraints on K-mouflage from local Solar System tests.

(bicategorical) colimit diagram in a certain 2-category of stacks.
  In this paper we use generalized Tannaka duality to explicitly compute
certain colimits in the 2-category of Adams stacks. Using this we extend recent
results of Bhatt from algebraic spaces to Adams stacks and a result of
Hall-Rydh to non-noetherian rings.
  We conclude the paper with a global version of the Beauville-Laszlo theorem,
which states that a large class of schemes and stacks can be built by gluing
the open complement of an effective Cartier divisor with the infinitesimal
neighbourhood of the divisor.

increasing attention to improve decision making in medical practice via
integrating evidence from well designed and conducted clinical research.
Meta-analysis is a statistical technique widely used in evidence-based medicine
for analytically combining the findings from independent clinical trials to
provide an overall estimation of a treatment effectiveness. The sample mean and
standard deviation are two commonly used statistics in meta-analysis but some
trials use the median, the minimum and maximum values, or sometimes the first
and third quartiles to report the results. Thus, to pool results in a
consistent format, researchers need to transform those information back to the
sample mean and standard deviation. In this paper, we investigate the optimal
estimation of the sample mean for meta-analysis from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. A major drawback in the literature is that the sample
size, needless to say its importance, is either ignored or used in a stepwise
but somewhat arbitrary manner, e.g., the famous method proposed by Hozo et al.
We solve this issue by incorporating the sample size in a smoothly changing
weight in the estimators to reach the optimal estimation. Our proposed
estimators not only improve the existing ones significantly but also share the
same virtue of the simplicity. The real data application indicates that our
proposed estimators are capable to serve as ""rules of thumb"" and will be widely
applied in evidence-based medicine.

K-varieties. The main advantage of this construction is to rely only on
resolution of singularities and not on a characteristic zero assumption, as did
previous results. As an application, we give a conditional positive answer to
Serre's question on the existence of rational fixed points of a G-action on the
affine space, for G a finite l-group. We end the chapter by showing how the
logarithmic point of view that we use in our construction leads to a new
understanding of the motivic nearby cycles with support of Guibert, Loeser and
Merle as a motivic volume.
  In chapter 4 we use the theory of logarithmic geometry to derive a new
formula for the motivic zeta function via the volume Poincar\'e series. More
precisely, we show how to compute the volume Poincar\'e series associated to a
generically smooth log smooth R-scheme in terms of its log geometry, more
specifically in terms of its associated fan in the sense of Kato. This formula
yields a much smaller set of candidate poles for the motivic zeta function and
seems especially well suited to tackle the monodromy conjecture of Halle and
Nicaise for Calabi-Yau K-varieties, for which log smooth models appear
naturally through the Gross-Siebert programme on mirror symmetry. We end the

reflector (DBR) with two dielectric gratings on top and on the bottom. Owing to
the diffraction of the two gratings, the transmission shows a comb-like
spectrum which red shifts with increasing the grating period during the
forbidden band of the DBR. The number density of the comb peaks increases with
increasing the number of the DBR cells, while the ratio of the average full
width at half maximum (FWHM) of the transmission peaks in the transmission comb
to the corresponding average free spectral range, being about 0.04 and 0.02 for
the TE and TM incident waves, is almost invariant. The average FWHM of the TM
waves is about half of the TE waves, and both they could be narrower than 0.1
nm. In addition, the transmission comb peaks of the TE and TM waves can be
fully separated during certain waveband. We further prove that the transmission
comb is robust against the randomness of the heights of the DBR layers, even
when a 15\% randomness is added to their heights. Therefore, the proposed

tend to be same as the data dimension grows to infinity for any sample size,
when the coordinate variables satisfy appropriate mixing conditions. Further,
their limiting powers do not depend on the heaviness of the tails of the
distributions. This is in striking contrast to the asymptotic results obtained
in the classical multivariate setup. On the other hand, we show that in the
presence of stronger dependence among the coordinate variables, the spatial
sign and rank based tests for high dimensional data can be asymptotically more
powerful than the mean based tests if in addition to the data dimension, the
sample size also grows to infinity. The sizes of some mean based tests for high
dimensional data studied in the recent literature are observed to be
significantly different from their nominal levels. This is due to the
inadequacy of the asymptotic approximations used for the distributions of those
test statistics. However, our asymptotic approximations for the tests based on
spatial signs and ranks are observed to work well when the tests are applied on
a variety of simulated and real datasets.

checking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model

allowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased

deterministic time $exp\{O(\sqrt{ \log n \log \log n})\}$.
  The result of Awerbuch et al. was improved by Panconesi and Srinivasan in

running time is $exp\{O(\sqrt{\log n})\}$ as well. Much more recently Barenboim
(2012) devised a distributed randomized constant-time algorithm for computing

coefficient being about $1.8$ meV/nm. Further, the periodic and linear photon
potentials are considered to control the transport of the exciton polaritons in
weak- and strong-field pump situations. In both situations the periodic
potential cannot by itself effectively suppress the scatterings of the disorder
potentials of the cavity photons and excitons and the nonlinear exciton-exciton
interaction. When the linear potential is added to the cavity photons, the
polariton transport exhibits the Bloch oscillation behavior. Importantly, the
polariton Bloch oscillation can strongly suppress the space broadening due to
the disorder potentials and nonlinear exciton-exciton interaction, which is
beneficial for designing the polariton circuits.

complex pattern on both local and global scales. In order to understand the
nature of this tangled web of magnetic fields, its magnetic skeleton, which
forms the boundaries between topologically distinct flux domains, may be
determined. The magnetic skeleton consists of null points, separatrix surfaces,
spines and separators. The skeleton is often used to clearly visualize key
elements of the magnetic configuration, but parts of the skeleton are also
locations where currents and waves may collect and dissipate.
  In this review, the nature of the magnetic skeleton on both global and local
scales, over solar cycle time scales, is explained. The behaviour of wave
pulses in the vicinity of both nulls and separators is discussed and so too is
the formation of current layers and reconnection at the same features. Each of
these processes leads to heating of the solar atmosphere, but collectively do
they provide enough heat, spread over a wide enough area, to explain the energy
losses throughout the solar atmosphere? Here, we consider this question for the
three different solar regions: active regions, open-field regions and the quiet
Sun.
  We find that the heating of active regions and open-field regions is highly
unlikely to be due to reconnection or wave dissipation at topological features,
but it is possible that these may play a role in the heating of the quiet Sun.
In active regions, the absence of a complex topology may play an important role
in allowing large energies to build up and then, subsequently, be explosively
released in the form of a solar flare. Additionally, knowledge of the intricate
boundaries of open-field regions (which the magnetic skeleton provides) could
be very important in determining the main acceleration mechanism(s) of the
solar wind.

aggregates, we show that geometric frustration inherent to competing

long-time sub diffusive relaxation of the same. Analysing individual particle
trajectories generated by molecular dynamics, we identify {\it caging} dynamics
of particles in compact clusters in contrast to the {\it bonding} scenario for
non-compact ones. Finally, by monitoring temperature dependence, we present a
generic relation between diffusivity and structural randomness of the
aggregates, irrespective of their thermodynamic equilibrium.

consistency (such that the phase-space distribution function is nowhere
negative for $r_a\geq r_{ac}$). We find that $r_{ac}$ decreases for decreasing
$\alpha$, and that the amount of kinetic energy that can be stored in the
radial direction relative to that stored in the tangential directions for
marginally consistent models increases for decreasing $\alpha$. In particular,
we find that isotropic systems are consistent in the explored range of

station to each user is performed at the base station using an uplink pilot
sequence. Such a channel estimation procedure suffers from pilot contamination.
Orthogonal pilot sequences are used in a given cell but, due to the shortage of
orthogonal sequences, the same pilot sequences must be reused in neighboring
cells, causing pilot contamination. The solution presented in this paper
suppresses pilot contamination, without the need for coordination among cells.
Pilot sequence hopping is performed at each transmission slot, which provides a
randomization of the pilot contamination. Using a modified Kalman filter, it is
shown that such randomized contamination can be significantly suppressed.
Comparisons with conventional estimation methods show that the mean squared

the HUM method we deduce the exact controllability of the corresponding
degenerate control problem when $\mu_a \in [0,2[$. We conclude the paper by
studying the boundary stabilization of the degenerate linearly damped wave
equation and show that a suitable boundary feedback stabilizes the system
exponentially. We extend this stability analysis to the degenerate nonlinearly
boundary damped wave equation, for an arbitrarily growing nonlinear feedback
close to the origin. This analysis proves that the degeneracy does not affect
the optimal energy decay rates at large time. We apply the optimal-weight
convexity method of \cite{alaamo2005, alajde2010} together with the results of
the previous section, to perform this stability analysis.

aim is to investigate whether these mid-IR bright, near-IR faint sources
contribute significantly to the overall population of massive galaxies at

using up to 30 photometric bands, we have determined that the redshift
distribution of our sample peaks at redshifts z~2.5-3.0, and ~32% of the
galaxies lie at z>=3. We have studied the contribution of these sources to the
galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high redshifts. We found that the
[4.5]<23, Ks_auto>24 galaxies produce a negligible change to the GSMF
previously determined for Ks_auto<24 sources at 3=<z<4, but their contribution
is more important at 4=<z<5, accounting for >~50% of the galaxies with stellar
masses Mst>~6 x 10^10 Msun. We also constrained the GSMF at the highest-mass
end (Mst>~2 x 10^11 Msun) at z>=5. From their presence at 5=<z<6, and virtual
absence at higher redshifts, we can pinpoint quite precisely the moment of
appearance of the first most massive galaxies as taking place in the ~0.2 Gyr
of elapsed time between z~6 and z~5. Alternatively, if very massive galaxies
existed earlier in cosmic time, they should have been significantly
dust-obscured to lie beyond the detection limits of current, large-area, deep

the primary star varies between 0.050"" and 0.059"", making these the highest
spatial resolution near-infrared images of the T Tauri system obtained to date.
Results. Our near-infrared images confirm the presence of extended emission
south of T Tau Sa, reported in the literature. New narrow-band images show, for
the first time, that this feature shows strong emission in both the Br-{\gamma}

0.92 mag brighter than T Tau Sb, which is in contrast to observations from Jan.
2014 (when T Tau Sa was fainter than Sb), and demonstrates that T Tau Sa has
entered a new period of high variability. The newly obtained astrometric
positions of T Tau Sa and Sb agree with orbital fits from previous works. The
orbit of T Tau S (the center of gravity of Sa and Sb) around T Tau N is poorly
constrained by the available observations and can be fit with a range of orbits
ranging from a nearly circular orbit with a period of 475 years to highly
eccentric orbits with periods up to 2.7*10^4 years. We also detected a feature
south of T Tau N, at a distance of $144 \pm 3$ mas, which shows the properties
of a new companion.

higher genus black hole spacetimes with a cosmological constant has some
peculiar features not shared by various other spacetimes in loop quantum
cosmology. As in the other cases, though the quantum geometric effects resolve
the physical singularity and result in a non-singular bounce, after the bounce
a spacetime with small spacetime curvature does not emerge in either the
subsequent backward or the forward evolution. Rather, in the asymptotic limit
the spacetime manifold is a product of two constant curvature spaces.
Interestingly, though the spacetime curvature of these asymptotic spacetimes is
very high, their effective metric is a solution to the Einstein's field
equations. Analysis of the components of the Ricci tensor shows that after the
singularity resolution, the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime leads to an effective
metric which can be interpreted as the `charged' Nariai, while the higher genus
black hole interior can similarly be interpreted as anti Bertotti-Robinson
spacetime with a cosmological constant. These spacetimes are `charged' in the
sense that the energy momentum tensor that satisfies the Einstein's field
equations is formally the same as the one for the uniform electromagnetic
field, albeit it has a purely quantum geometric origin. The asymptotic
spacetimes also have an emergent cosmological constant which is different in
magnitude, and sometimes even its sign, from the cosmological constant in the

fine tuning of the latter cosmological constant, we show that `uncharged'

catalytic properties in catechol O-methyltransferase, a representative example
of a methyltransferase critical to human health. Using QM regions ranging in

requiring approximately 500-600 atoms if the QM residues are chosen simply by
distance from the substrate. This slow approach to asymptotic limit is due to
charge transfer from protein residues to the reacting substrates. Our large
QM/MM calculations enable identification of charge separation for fragments in
the transition state as a key component of enzymatic methyl transfer rate
enhancement. We introduce charge shift analysis that reveals the minimum number
of protein residues (ca. 11-16 residues or 200-300 atoms for COMT) needed for
quantitative agreement with large-QM simulations. The identified residues are
not those that would be typically selected using criteria such as chemical
intuition or proximity. These results provide a recipe for a more careful

increase in the static permittivity. In the ceramics, terahertz transmission
spectra show five low-energy magnetic excitations including two which were not

cm-1. Heating induces softening of all magnetic modes. At a temperature of 5 K,
applying an external magnetic field of up to 7 T irreversibly alters the

experimentally that already a small number of controllers placed at certain

perform a set of experiments that explore the existence and costs of feasible

there is a dearth of planets around the closest binaries. In this paper we
suggest how this dearth may be explained by the presence of a distant stellar
tertiary companion, which shrunk the inner binary orbit by the process of Kozai
cycles and tidal friction, a mechanism that has been implicated for producing
most binaries with periods below 7 d. We show that the geometry and orbital
dynamics of these evolving triple-star systems are highly restrictive for a
circumbinary planet, which is subject itself to Kozai modulation, on one hand,
and can shield the two inner stars from their Kozai cycle and subsequent
shrinking, on the other hand. Only small planets on wide and inclined orbits
may form, survive and allow for the inner binary shrinkage. Those are difficult
to detect.

the stars. Low- and intermediate-mass stars lose copious amounts of mass during
the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) which obscure the central star making it
difficult to study the stellar spectra and determine the stellar mass. In this
study, we present observational data that can be used to determine lower limits
to the stellar mass. Method: Spectra of nine heavily reddened AGB stars taken
by the Herschel Space Observatory display numerous molecular emission lines.
The strongest emission lines are due to H2O. We search for the presence of
isotopologues of H2O in these objects. Result: We detected the 16O and 17O
isotopologues of water in these stars, but lines due to H2^{18}O are absent.
The lack of 18O is predicted by a scenario where the star has undergone
hot-bottom burning which preferentially destroys 18O relative to 16O and 17O.
From stellar evolution calculations, this process is thought to occur when the
stellar mass is above 5 Msun for solar metallicity. Hence, observations of
different isotopologues of H2O can be used to help determine the lower limit to
the initial stellar mass. Conclusion: From our observations, we deduce that
these extreme OH/IR stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses of >= 5 Msun.
Their high mass-loss rates of ~ 1.0e-4 Msun/yr may affect the enrichment of the
interstellar medium and the overall chemical evolution of our Galaxy.

the in-plane critical magnetic field in nanofilms. We demonstrate that the
orbital term suppresses the critical field and reduces the amplitude of the
thickness-dependent critical field oscillations. Moreover, due to the orbital
effect, the slope $H_{c,||}-T_c$ at $T_c(0)$ becomes finite and decreases with
increasing film thickness in agreement with recent experiments. The temperature

of the neutron star to a quark star) occurring in a massive binary,
experiencing two Common Envelope (CE) phases, can quantitatively explain the
light curves of LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz. The more massive component (A) explodes
first as a normal SN, yielding a Neutron Star which ejects the hydrogen
envelope of the companion when the system enters its first CE phase. During the
second CE phase, the NS spirals into and inflates the second He-rich CE. In the
process it gains mass and triggers a Quark-Nova, outside of the CO core,
leaving behind a Quark Star. The first hump in our model is the QN shock
re-energizing the expanded He-rich CE. The QN occurs when the He-rich envelope
is near maximum size (~ 1000R_sun) and imparts enough energy to unbind and
eject the envelope. Subsequent merging of the Quark Star with the CO core of
component B, driven by gravitational radiation, turns the Quark star to a Black
Hole. The ensuing Black Hole accretion provides sufficient power for the second
brighter and long lasting hump. Our model suggests a possible connection
between SLSNe-I and type Ic-BL SNe which occur when the Quark Nova is triggered
inside the CO core. We estimate the rate of QNe in massive binaries during the
second CE phase to be ~ 5x10^(-5) of that of core-collapse SNe.

crystal (PnC) nanostructures with a period of 300 nm was investigated by
measuring the thermal conductivity using micrometer-scale time-domain
thermoreflectance. The placement of circular nanoholes has a strong influence
on thermal conductivity when the periodicity is within the range of the thermal
phonon mean free path. A staggered hole structure, i.e., a triangular lattice,
has lower thermal conductivity, where the difference in thermal conductivity
depends on the porosity of the structure. The largest difference in
conductivity of approximately 20% was observed at a porosity of around 30%.
This crystal structure dependent thermal conductivity can be understood by
considering the local heat flux disorder created by a staggered hole structure.
Numerical simulation using the Monte Carlo technique was also employed and also
showed the lower thermal conductivity for a triangular lattice structure.
Besides gaining a deeper understanding of nanoscale thermal phonon transport,
this information would be useful in the design of highly efficient
thermoelectric materials created by nanopatterning.

rate of $r_k(s,n)$ for all $s \ge k+1$ was posed by Erdos and Hajnal in 1972.
  (2) We show that determining the tower growth rate of $r_k(P_{k+1}, n)$ is
equivalent to determining the tower growth rate of $r_k(n,n)$, which is a
notorious conjecture of Erdos, Hajnal and Rado from 1965 that remains open.

approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow,
whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by
applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of
complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop
categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of
approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that
the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true

provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational
inference.

of dark matter and dark energy in the form of variable modified Chaplygin gas
(VMCG) is considered. The permitted values of the VMCG parameters are
determined by the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data.
Here we present the Hubble parameter in terms of the observable parameters
$\Omega_{dm0}$, $\Omega_{vmcg0}$, $H_{0}$, redshift $z$ and other parameters
like $\alpha$, $A$, $\gamma$ and $n$. From Stern data set (12 points), we have
obtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$
test. The best-fit values of the parameters are obtained by 66\%, 90\% and 99\%
confidence levels. Next due to joint analysis with BAO and CMB observations, we
have also obtained the bounds of the parameters ($A,\gamma$) by fixing some
other parameters $\alpha$ and $n$. The best fit value of distance modulus
$\mu(z)$ is obtained for the VMCG model in HL gravity, and it is concluded that
our model is perfectly consistent with the union2 sample data.

decomposition (PCD) render a stable and efficient solution to the systems
without a perturbation of regularization. This paper proposes a new PCD
algorithm by tuning Cross Approximation (CA) algorithm to kernel matrices which
merges the merits of PCD and CA, and proves as well as numerically exemplifies
that it solves large kernel systems two-order more efficiently than those
resorts to regularization. As a by-product, a diagonal-pivoted CA technique is
also shown efficient in eigen-decomposition of large covariance matrices in an
uncertainty quantification problem.

allow to encode a message as some number of packets, such that any large enough
subset of these packets is sufficient to fully reconstruct the message. It
requires undamaged packets, while the packets which were not lost are usually
damaged in real scenarios. Hence, an additional error correction layer is often
required: adding some level of redundancy to each packet to be able to repair
eventual damages. This approach requires a priori knowledge of the final damage
level of every packet - insufficient redundancy leads to packet loss,
overprotection means suboptimal channel rate. However, the sender may have
inaccurate or even no a priori information about the final damage levels, for
example in applications like broadcasting, degradation of a storage medium or
damage of picture watermarking.
  Joint Reconstruction Codes (JRC) setting is introduced and discussed in this
paper for the purpose of removing the need of a priori knowledge of damage
level and sub-optimality caused by overprotection and discarding underprotected
packets. It is obtained by combining both processes: reconstruction from
multiple packets and forward error correction. The decoder combines the
resultant informational content of all received packets accordingly to their
actual noise level, which can be estimated a posteriori individually for each
packet. Assuming binary symmetric channel (BSC) of $\epsilon$ bit-flip
probability, every potentially damaged bit carries
$R_0(\epsilon)=1-h_1(\epsilon)$ bits of information, where $h_1$ is the Shannon
entropy. The minimal requirement to fully reconstruct the message is that the
sum of rate $R_0(\epsilon)$ over all bits is at least the size of the message.
We will discuss sequential decoding for the reconstruction purpose, which
statistical behavior can be estimated using Renyi entropy.

endeavor, an uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and
its duration. This uncertainty is associated with the task of synchronizing the
spike trains of different duration representing different words. The
uncertainty involves peculiar quantum features, so that word comparison amounts
to measurement-based-quantum computation. Such a quantum behavior explains the
onset and decay of the memory window connecting successive pieces of a
linguistic text. The behavior here discussed is applicable to other reported
evidences of quantum effects in human linguistic processes, so far lacking a
plausible framework, since either no efforts to assign an appropriate quantum
constant had been associated or speculating on microscopic processes dependent
on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic decoherence times.

  Model",,,,,"cs.SI math.CO math.PR physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spatial preferential attachment (SPA) is a model for complex networks. In
the SPA model, nodes are embedded in a metric space, and each node has a sphere
of influence whose size increases if the node gains an in-link, and otherwise
decreases with time. In this paper, we study the behaviour of the SPA model
when the distribution of the nodes is non-uniform. Specifically, the space is
divided into dense and sparse regions, where it is assumed that the dense
regions correspond to coherent communities. We prove precise theoretical
results regarding the degree of a node, the number of common neighbours, and
the average out-degree in a region. Moreover, we show how these theoretically
derived results about the graph properties of the model can be used to
formulate a reliable estimator for the distance between certain pairs of nodes,
and to estimate the density of the region containing a given node.

software and Excel. For data analysis, we used the descriptive statistics
indicators, and a series of bi-varied analysis for testing some statistical
assumptions. Viewed at first with skepticism by the Internet users in Romania,
because of the many news about how dangerous the credit card payments are, the
online stores have gained much ground and trust in the recent years. Since the
study was conducted mainly in the online environment, we can not talk about the
representativeness of the sample, only about a trend observed in the studied
population. The study helps us understand the population reactions and
attitudes regarding the online shopping. The study revealed some important
issues regarding the online shopping in Mures county, issues that are described
in detail in the content of this paper.
