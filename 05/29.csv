an eclipsing binary with the orbital period of 1050d. We also found evidence of

most likely, it would be a second such outburst recorded in the Magellanic
Cloud symbiotic system. We confirmed that the red giant is enhanced in carbon,
and estimated C/O~1.2 by fitting a model atmosphere to the SALT spectrum. We
also found bi-periodic pulsations of the red giant, and demonstrated that it is

paramount importance in magnetic fusion plasmas, as high collisionality in the

may occur in concentrations of dust grains trapped in pressure maxima. Dramatic
crescent-shaped dust concentrations have been seen in recent radio images at
sub-mm wavelengths. These disk asymmetries could represent the initial phases
of planet formation in the dust trap scenario, provided that grain sizes are
spatially segregated. A testable prediction of azimuthal dust trapping is that
progressively larger grains should be more sharply confined and furthermore the
trapped grains should follow a distribution that is markedly different from the
gas. However, gas tracers such as CO and the infrared emission from small
grains are both very optically thick where the submm continuum originates, so
observations have been unable to test the trapping predictions or to identify
compact concentrations of larger grains required for planet formation by
core-accretion. Here we report multifrequency observations of HD142527, from
34GHz to 700GHz, that reveal a compact concentration of ~cm-sized grains, with
a few Earth masses, embedded in a large-scale crescent of ~mm-sized particles.
The emission peaks at wavelengths shorter than ~1mm are optically thick and
trace the temperature structure resulting from shadows cast by the inner
regions. Given this temperature structure, we infer that the largest dust
grains are concentrated in the 34 GHz clump. We conclude that dust trapping is
efficient for approximately cm-sized grains and leads to enhanced
concentrations, while the smaller grains largely reflect the gas distribution.

Majority of current literature focuses on optimal scheduling of inpatients, but

current scheduling models are optimizing based on inaccurate input data. We
developed a Clustering and Scheduling Integrated (CSI) approach to capture
patient flows through a network of hospital services. CSI functions by
clustering patients into groups based on similarity of trajectory using a novel
Semi-Markov model (SMM)-based clustering scheme proposed in this paper, as
opposed to clustering by admit type or condition as in previous literature. The
methodology is validated by simulation and then applied to real patient data
from a partner hospital where we see it outperforms current methods. Further,
we demonstrate that extant optimization methods achieve significantly better
results on key hospital performance measures under CSI, compared with
traditional estimation approaches, increasing elective admissions by 97% and
utilization by 22% compared to 30% and 8% using traditional estimation
techniques. From a theoretical standpoint, the SMM-clustering is a novel
approach applicable to any temporal-spatial stochastic data that is prevalent
in many industries and application areas.

kind of mixing that occurs in stably-stratified stellar radiation zones in the
presence of an inverse mean-molecular-weight gradient. Brown et al. (2013)
recently proposed a new model for mixing by fingering convection, which
contains no free parameter, and was found to fit the results of direct
numerical simulations in almost all cases. Notably, however, they found that
mixing was substantially enhanced above their predicted values in the few cases
where large-scale gravity waves, followed by thermo-compositional layering,
grew spontaneously from the fingering convection. This effect is well-known in
the oceanographic context, and is attributed to the excitation of the so-called
""collective instability"". In this work, we build on the results of Brown et al.
(2013) and of Traxler et al. (2011b) to determine the conditions under which
the collective instability may be expected. We find that it is only relevant in
stellar regions which have a relatively large Prandtl number (the ratio of the
kinematic viscosity to the thermal diffusivity), $O(10^{-3})$ or larger. This
implies that the collective instability cannot occur in main sequence stars,
where the Prandtl number is always much smaller than this (except in the outer
layers of surface convection zones where fingering is irrelevant anyway). It
could in principle be excited in regions of high electron degeneracy, during He
core flash, or in the interiors of white dwarfs. We discuss the implications of
our findings for these objects, both from a theoretical and from an
observational point of view.

correlators of the stress-energy tensor operator and the generators of the

more second order coefficients and that all thermodynamic functions including
energy density receive acceleration and vorticity dependent corrections.
Notably, also the relation between \rho and p, that is the equation of state,
is affected by acceleration and vorticity. We have calculated the corrections
for a free real scalar field -- both massive and massless -- and we have found
that they increase, particularly for a massive field, at very high acceleration

their almost intact envelope and young disk. The structure of the disk-envelope
interface of the prototypical Class 0 source, VLA1623A which has a confirmed
Keplerian disk, is constrained from ALMA observations of DCO+ 3-2 and C18O 2-1.
The physical structure of VLA1623 is obtained from the large-scale SED and
continuum radiative transfer. An analytic model using a simple network coupled
with radial density and temperature profiles is used as input for a 2D line
radiative transfer calculation for comparison with the ALMA Cycle 0 12m array
and Cycle 2 ACA observations of VLA1623. DCO+ emission shows a clumpy structure
bordering VLA1623A's Keplerian disk, suggesting a cold ring-like structure at
the disk-envelope interface. The radial position of the observed DCO+ peak is
reproduced in our model only if the region's temperature is between 11-16K,
lower than expected from models constrained by continuum and SED. Altering the
density has little effect on the DCO+ position, but increased density is needed
to reproduce the disk traced in C18O. The DCO+ emission around VLA1623A is the
product of shadowing of the envelope by the disk. Disk-shadowing causes a drop
in the gas temperature outside of the disk on >200AU scales, encouraging
deuterated molecule production. This indicates that the physical structure of
the disk-envelope interface differs from the rest of the envelope, highlighting
the drastic impact that the disk has on the envelope and temperature structure.
The results presented here show that DCO+ is an excellent cold temperature

systems that are driven by both a periodic temperature variation and some
external parameter modulating their energy. This set-up covers, in particular,
periodic micro and nano-heat engines. In a first step, we show how to express
total entropy production by properly identified time-independent affinities and
currents without making a linear response assumption. In linear response,
kinetic coefficients akin to Onsager coefficients can be identified.
Specializing to a Fokker-Planck type dynamics, we show that these coefficients
can be expressed as a sum of an adiabatic contribution and one reminiscent of a
Green-Kubo expression that contains deviations from adiabaticity. Furthermore,
we show that the generalized kinetic coefficients fulfill an Onsager-Casimir
type symmetry tracing back to microscopic reversibility. This symmetry allows
for non-identical off-diagonal coefficients if the driving protocols are not
symmetric under time-reversal. We then derive a novel constraint on the kinetic
coefficients that is sharper than the second law and provides an
efficiency-dependent bound on power. As one consequence, we can prove that the
power vanishes at least linearly when approaching Carnot efficiency. We
illustrate our general framework by explicitly working out the paradigmatic
case of a Brownian heat engine realized by a colloidal particle in a
time-dependent harmonic trap subject to a periodic temperature profile. This
case study reveals inter alia that our new general bound on power is
asymptotically tight.

the first-ever detection of cosmic-ray antideuterons, in particular as an
indirect signature of dark matter annihilation or decay. In contrast to
indirect dark matter searches using positrons, antiprotons, or gamma-rays,
which suffer from relatively high and uncertain astrophysical backgrounds,
searches with antideuterons benefit from very suppressed conventional
backgrounds, offering a potential breakthrough in unexplored phase space for
dark matter. This article is based on the first dedicated cosmic-ray
antideuteron workshop, which was held at UCLA in June 2014. It reviews broad
classes of dark matter candidates that result in detectable cosmic-ray
antideuteron fluxes, as well as the status and prospects of current
experimental searches. The coalescence model of antideuteron production and the
influence of antideuteron measurements at particle colliders are discussed.
This is followed by a review of the modeling of antideuteron propagation
through the magnetic fields, plasma currents, and molecular material of our
Galaxy, the solar system, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the atmosphere.
Finally, the three ongoing or planned experiments that are sensitive to
cosmic-ray antideuterons, BESS, AMS-02, and GAPS, are detailed. As cosmic-ray
antideuteron detection is a rare event search, multiple experiments with
orthogonal techniques and backgrounds are essential. Many theoretical and
experimental groups have contributed to these studies over the last decade,
this review aims to provide the first coherent discussion of the relevant dark
matter theories that antideuterons probe, the challenges to predictions and
interpretations of antideuteron signals, and the experimental efforts toward
cosmic antideuteron detection.

  In this paper we estimate the location of the extreme zeros (those closest to
$z=1$) of the para-orthogonal polynomials from the $(c_n,d_n)$-parametrization
of the measure, and use this information to establish sufficient conditions for
the existence of a gap in the support of $\mu$ at $z=1$. These results are
easily reformulated in order to find gaps in the support of $\mu$ at any other
$z\in \mathbb T$.
  We provide also some examples showing that the bounds are tight and
illustrating their computational applications.

detection of malaria pigment (hemozoin) crystals in blood via their

the first generation of intraerythrocytic parasites at the ring stage 61-66
hours after sporozoite injection demonstrating better sensitivity than light

severe P. berghei infections show that the clearance period of hemozoin in mice
is approx. 5 days which indicates the feasibility of the detection of later

together with the demonstrated sensitivity, we believe that the MO method is a
suitable candidate for in-depth clinical evaluation in endemic settings.

1/2-BPS saturated strings in \ntwo supersymmetric QCD with $N_f=N$. The
non-supersymmetric case was studied previously; technically our results agree
with those obtained previously, although our interpretation is totally
different. In the large-$N$ limit we detect a phase transition at $L\sim
\Lambda_{\rm CP}^{-1}$ (which is expected to become a rapid crossover at finite
$N$). If at large $L$ the CP$(N-1)$ model develops a mass gap and is in the
Coulomb/confinement phase, with exponentially suppressed finite-$L$ effects, at
small $L$ it is in the deconfinement phase, and the orientational modes
contribute to the L\""usher term. The latter becomes dependent on the rank of
the bulk gauge group.
  In the supersymmetric CP$(N-1)$ models at finite $L$ we find a large-$N$
solution which was not known previously. We observe a single phase
independently of the value of $L\Lambda_{\rm CP}$. For any value of this
parameter a mass gap develops and supersymmetry remains unbroken. So does the
$SU(N)$ symmetry of the target space. The mass gap turns out to be independent
of the string length. The L\""uscher term is absent due to supersymmetry.

to collect accurately geocoded data for several variables simultaneously. In

autoregressive (MCAR) models are a common choice. However, inference from these

often assumes a separable covariance structure. Here, we present a multivariate

conditional relationships between the variables that does not rely on a
pre-specified neighborhood structure, is non-separable, and is computationally
efficient. Covariance and cross-covariance functions are defined in the
spectral domain to obtain computational efficiency. Posterior inference on the
correlation matrix allows for quantification of the conditional dependencies.
The approach is illustrated for the toxic element arsenic and four other soil
elements whose relative concentrations were measured on a spatial lattice.
Understanding conditional relationships between arsenic and other soil elements

conditions on $\mathbb R \times S^1$, semi-classical techniques and resurgence.
While the $O(N)$ model has no instantons for $N>3$, it has (non-instanton)
saddles on $\mathbb R^2$, which we call 2d-saddles. On $\mathbb R \times S^1$,
the resurgent relation between perturbation theory and non-perturbative physics
is encoded in new saddles, which are associated with the affine root system of
the ${\frak o}(N) $ algebra. These events may be viewed as fractionalizations
of the 2d-saddles. The first beta function coefficient, given by the dual
Coxeter number, can then be intepreted as the sum of the multiplicities (dual
Kac labels) of these fractionalized objects. Surprisingly, the new saddles in
$O(N)$ models in compactified space are in one-to-one correspondence with
monopole-instanton saddles in $SO(N)$ gauge theory on $\mathbb R^3 \times S^1$.
The Grassmannian sigma models ${ \rm Gr}(N, M)$ have 2d instantons, which
fractionalize into $N$ kink-instantons. The small circle dynamics of both sigma
models can be described as a dilute gas of the one-events and two-events,
bions. One-events are the leading source of a variety of non-perturbative
effects, and produce the strong scale of the 2d theory in the compactified
theory. We show that in both types of sigma models the neutral bion emulates
the role of IR-renormalons. We also study the topological theta angle

$8.7^{+3.3}_{-2.2}\times10^{5}L_{\odot}$ during the optical maximum. Both the

affine, Riemann-Cartan, Riemannian and Weizenb\""ock geometries, which are
conventionally used as spacetime models. Further, we discuss the case of Cartan
geometries which can be used to model observer space instead of spacetime. We
show which vector fields on an observer space can be interpreted as symmetry
generators of an underlying spacetime manifold, and may hence be called
""spatio-temporal"". We finally apply this construction to Finsler spacetimes and
show that symmetry generating vector fields on a Finsler spacetime are indeed
in a one-to-one correspondence with spatio-temporal vector fields on its

quantum mechanical spin systems known as stabilizer Hamiltonians. The
thermalizing dynamics are modeled by a Davies master equation that arises from
a weak local coupling of the system to a large thermal bath. Two temperature
regimes are considered. First we clarify how in the low temperature regime, the
thermalization time is governed by a generalization of the energy barrier
between orthogonal ground states. When no energy barrier is present the
Hamiltonian thermalizes in a time that is at most quadratic in the system size.
Secondly, we show that above a universal critical temperature, every stabilizer
Hamiltonian relaxes to its unique thermal state in a time which scales at most
linearly in the size of the system. We provide an explicit lower bound on the
critical temperature. Finally, we discuss the implications of these result for
the problem of self-correcting quantum memories with stabilizer Hamiltonians.

materials, for instance magnetic memory. Multiferroics are materials which
exhibit electric and magnetic order simultaneously. Due to the coupling of
electric and magnetic effects, these materials show a strong potential to
control electricity and magnetism and, more generally, the properties and
propagation of light. One of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive recent
results in multiferroics is directional anisotropy, the asymmetry of light
propagation with respect to the direction of propagation. The absorption in the
material can be different for forward and backward propagation of light, which
in extreme case may lead to complete suppression of absorption in one
direction. Another remarkable effect in multiferroics is directional
birefringence, i.e. different velocities of light for different directions of
propagation. In this paper, we demonstrate giant directional birefringence in a
multiferroic samarium ferroborate. The effect is easily observed for linear
polarization of light in the range of millimeter-wavelengths, and survives down
to very low frequencies. The dispersion and absorption close to the
electromagnon resonance can be controlled and fully suppressed in one
direction. Therefore, samarium ferroborate is a universal tool for optical
control: with a magnetic field as an external parameter it allows switching
between two functionalities: polarization rotation and directional anisotropy.

fragmentation of the tube. Because of local conservation laws, the production
of a $q$-$\bar q$ pair will lead to correlations of adjacently produced mesons
(mostly pions). Adjacently produced mesons however can be signalled by their
rapidity difference $\Delta y$ falling within the window of $|\Delta y |
$$\lesssim$$ 1/(dN/dy)$, on account of the space-time-rapidity ordering of
produced mesons in a flux tube fragmentation. Therefore, the local conservation
laws of momentum, charge, and flavor will lead to a suppression of angular
correlation function $dN/(d\Delta \phi\, d\Delta y)$ for two mesons with
opposite charges or strangeness on the near side at $(\Delta \phi, \Delta y)$$
\sim$0, but an enhanced correlation on the back-to-back, away side at $\Delta
\phi$$\sim$$ \pi$, within the window of $|\Delta y |$$\lesssim$$ 1/(dN/dy)$.
These properties can be used as signatures for the fragmentation of a color
flux tube. The gross features of the signature of flux tube fragmentation for
two oppositely charged mesons are qualitatively consistent with the STAR and
NA61/SHINE angular correlation data for two hadrons with opposite charges in
the low-$p_T$ region in high-energy $pp$ collisions.

which data at training and test time come from similar but different
distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain
adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved,
predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the
training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea
in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data
from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled
target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach
promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main
learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the
shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be
achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard
layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture
can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent,
and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning
packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct
classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification),
where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is
achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the
context of person re-identification application.

to be more likely to share characteristics than expected from random chance.
Such genetic correlations should, as John Maynard Smith famously pointed out,
strongly influence evolutionary dynamics. We explore and quantify these
intuitions by comparing three GP maps - RNA SS, HP for tertiary, Polyominoes
for protein quaternary structure - to a simple random null model that maintains
the number of genotypes mapping to each phenotype, but assigns genotypes
randomly. The mutational neighbourhood of a genotype in these GP maps is much
more likely to contain (mutationally neutral) genotypes mapping to the same
phenotype than in the random null model. These neutral correlations can
increase the robustness to mutations by orders of magnitude over that of the
null model, raising robustness above the critical threshold for the formation
of large neutral networks that enhance the capacity for neutral exploration. We
also study {\em non-neutral correlations}: Compared to the null model, i) If a
particular (non-neutral) phenotype is found once in the 1-mutation
neighbourhood of a genotype, then the chance of finding that phenotype multiple
times in this neighbourhood is larger than expected; ii) If two genotypes are
connected by a single neutral mutation, then their respective non-neutral
1-mutation neighbourhoods are more likely to be similar; iii) If a genotype
maps to a folding or self-assembling phenotype, then its non-neutral neighbours
are less likely to be a potentially deleterious non-folding or non-assembling
phenotype. Non-neutral correlations of type i) and ii) reduce the rate at which
new phenotypes can be found by neutral exploration, and so may diminish
evolvability, while non-neutral correlations of type iii) may instead
facilitate evolutionary exploration and so increase evolvability.

found in two distinct optical states. These states are generally associated
with the known flaring/normal branch X-ray states, although the flux
distributions associated with these states overlap. Furthermore, we find that
the optical power spectrum of Sco X-1 differs substantially between optical
luminosity states. Additionally we find rms-flux relations in both optical
states, but only find a linear relation during periods of low optical
luminosity. The full optical/X-ray discrete correlation function displays a
broad ~12.5 hour optical lag. However during the normal branch phase the X-ray
and optical fluxes are anti-correlated, whilst being correlated during the
flaring branch. We also performed a Cepstrum analysis on the full Kepler light
curve to determine the presence of any echoes within the optical light curve
alone. We find significant echo signals, consistent with the optical lags found
using the discrete cross-correlation. We speculate that whilst some of the
driving X-ray emission is reflected by the disk, some is absorbed and
re-processed on the thermal timescale, giving rise to both the observed optical

suppressed in a window of frequencies near zero. This behavior is universal in
all Lifshitz theories without additional constraining symmetries. On the

which it is in an observable configuration ($f_\mathrm{obs}$). Using a suite of
Monte Carlo experiments, we study the dependence of $f_\mathrm{obs}$ upon the
inner working angle (IWA) and minimum achievable contrast ($C_\mathrm{min}$) of
the direct-imaging observatory; the planet's phase function, geometric albedo,
single-scattering albedo, radius, and distance from Earth; and the semi-major
axis distribution of EGPs. We calculate phase functions for a given geometric
or single-scattering albedo, assuming various scattering mechanisms. We find
that the Lambertian phase function can predict significantly larger
$f_\mathrm{obs}$'s with respect to the more realistic Rayleigh phase function.
For observations made with WFIRST/AFTA's baseline capabilities
($C_\mathrm{min}\sim10^{-9}$, $\mathrm{IWA}\sim0.2''$), Jupiter-like planets
orbiting stars within 10, 30, and 50 parsecs of Earth have volume-averaged
observability fractions of ${\sim}$12%, 3%, and 0.5%, respectively. At 10
parsecs, such observations yield $f_\mathrm{obs}>1\%$ for low- to
modest-eccentricity planets with semi-major axes in the range ${\sim}2 - 10$
AU. If $C_\mathrm{min}=10^{-10}$, this range extends to ${\sim}35$ AU. We find
that, in all but the most optimistic configurations, the probability for
detection in a blind search is low (${<}\,5\%$). However, with orbital
parameter constraints from long-term radial-velocity campaigns and Gaia

models the halo-model power is accurate to $\simeq 5$ per cent for $k\leq

can be adapted to account for the effects of baryonic feedback on the power
spectrum. We demonstrate this by fitting the halo model to power spectra from
the OWLS hydrodynamical simulation suite via parameters that govern halo
internal structure. We are able to fit all feedback models investigated at the
5 per cent level using only two free parameters, and we place limits on the
range of these halo parameters for feedback models investigated by the OWLS
simulations. Accurate predictions to high-$k$ are vital for weak lensing
surveys, and these halo parameters could be considered nuisance parameters to
marginalize over in future analyses to mitigate uncertainty regarding the
details of feedback. Finally, we investigate how lensing observables predicted
by our model compare to those from simulations and from HALOFIT for a range of
$k$-cuts and feedback models and quantify the angular scales at which these
effects become important. Code to calculate power spectra from the model

stellar mass (sSFR) decreases with increasing mass in normal ""main-sequence""
star forming galaxies. Many processes have been advocated as responsible for
such a trend (also known as mass quenching), e.g., feedback from active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), and the formation of classical bulges. We determine a
refined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local Universe. To
this aim we use the Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey (Halpha3) of
field galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA)
in the Coma and Local superclusters. By complementing this local determination
with high-redshift measurements from the literature, we reconstruct the star
formation history of main-sequence galaxies as a function of stellar mass from
the present epoch up to z=3. In agreement with previous studies, our analysis
shows that quenching mechanisms occur above a threshold stellar mass M_knee
that evolves with redshift as propto (1+z)^{2}. Moreover, visual morphological
classification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharp
increase in the fraction of visually-classified strong bars with mass, hinting
that strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the sSFR above
M_knee. We test this hypothesis using a simple but physically-motivated
numerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quench
star formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. We conclude that
strong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the inner
parts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely required
to quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies.
Intriguingly, when we extrapolate our model to higher redshifts, we
successfully recover the observed redshift evolution for M_knee.

number of members of these associations have been identified in the SACY
collaboration. We can use the proximity and youth of these members to
investigate key ingredients in star formation processes, such as multiplicity.
  Aims. We present the statistics of identified multiple systems from 113
confirmed SACY members. We derive multiplicity frequencies, mass-ratio, and
physical separation distributions in a consistent parameter space, and compare
our results to other PMS populations and the field.
  Methods. We have obtained adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared observations
with NACO (ESO/VLT) and IRCAL (Lick Observatory) for at least one epoch of all
113 SACY members. We have identified multiple systems using co-moving
proper-motion analysis and using contamination estimates. We have explored
ranges in projected separation and mass-ratio of a [3-1000 au], and q [0.1-1],
respectively.
  Results. We have identified 31 multiple systems (28 binaries and 3 triples).
We derive a multiplicity frequency (MF) of MF_(3-1000au)=28.4 +4.7, -3.9% and a
triple frequency (TF) of TF_(3-1000au)=2.8 +2.5, -0.8% in the separation range
of 3-1000 au. We do not find any evidence for an increase in the MF with
primary mass. The estimated mass-ratio of our statistical sample (with
power-law index gamma=-0.04 +/- 0.14) is consistent with a flat distribution
(gamma = 0).
  Conclusions. We show further similarities (but also hints of discrepancies)
between SACY and the Taurus region: flat mass-ratio distributions and
statistically similar MF and TF values. We also compared the SACY sample to the
field (in the separation range of 19-100 au), finding that the two
distributions are indistinguishable, suggesting a similar formation mechanism.

spans a broad range of luminosities from Lbol=10^44.4 to 10^46.8 erg/s and
allows an investigation of whether halo gas properties are connected with
quasar properties. We find a strong correlation between luminosity and cool gas
covering fraction. In particular, low-luminosity quasars exhibit a mean gas
covering fraction comparable to inactive galaxies of similar masses, but more
luminous quasars exhibit excess cool gas approaching what is reported
previously at z=2. Moreover, 30-40% of the MgII absorption occurs at radial
velocities of |v|>300 km/s from the quasar, inconsistent with gas bound to a
typical quasar host halo. The large velocity offsets and observed luminosity
dependence of the cool gas near quasars can be explained if the gas arises
from: (1) neighboring halos correlated through large-scale structure at Mpc
scales, (2) feedback from luminous quasars, or (3) debris from the mergers
thought to trigger luminous quasars. The first of these scenarios is in tension
with the lack of correlation between quasar luminosity and clustering while the
latter two make distinct predictions that can be tested with additional
observations.

samples from the map and power spectrum, each conditional on the other. This
approach neatly circumvents difficulties associated with complicated survey
geometry and masks that plague frequentist power spectrum estimators, since the
power spectrum inference provides prior information about the field in masked
regions at every sampling step. We demonstrate this approach for inference of
tomographic shear $E$-mode, $B$-mode and $EB$-cross power spectra from a
simulated galaxy shear catalogue with a number of important features; galaxies
distributed on the sky and in redshift with photometric redshift uncertainties,

discretization is a widely used implicit solvation model in chemical
simulations. However, its application in quantum mechanical calculations of
large-scale biomolecular systems can be limited by computational expense of
both the gas phase electronic structure and the solvation interaction. We have
previously used graphical processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the first of
these steps. Here, we extend the use of GPUs to accelerate electronic structure
calculations including C-PCM solvation. Implementation on the GPU leads to
significant acceleration of the generation of the required integrals for C-PCM.
We further propose two strategies to improve the solution of the required
linear equations: a dynamic convergence threshold and a randomized block-Jacobi
preconditioner. These strategies are not specific to GPUs and are expected to
be beneficial for both CPU and GPU implementations. We benchmark the
performance of the new implementation using over 20 small proteins in solvent
environment. Using a single GPU, our method evaluates the C-PCM related
integrals and their derivatives more than 10X faster than a conventional CPU
based implementation. Our improvements to the linear solver provide a further
3X acceleration. The overall calculations including C-PCM solvation require
typically 20-40% more effort than their gas phase counterparts for moderate
basis set and molecule surface discretization level. The relative cost of the
C-PCM solvation correction decreases as the basis sets and/or cavity radii
increase. Therefore description of solvation with this model should be routine.

of the Sun through the Galaxy and the evolution of the Earth's orbital
parameters in modulating non-terrestrial mechanisms. I build models to predict
the extinction rate of species, the temporal variation of the impact cratering
rate and ice sheet deglaciations, and then compare these models with other
models within a Bayesian framework. I find that the temporal distribution of
mass extinction events over the past 550 Myr can be explained just as well by a
uniform random distribution as by other models, such as variations in the
stellar density local to the Sun arising from the Sun's orbit. Given the
uncertainties in the Galaxy model and the Sun's current phase space
coordinates, as well as the errors in the geological data, it is not possible
to draw a clear connection between terrestrial extinction and the solar motion.
In a separate study, I find that the solar motion, which modulates the Galactic
tidal forces imposed on Oort cloud comets, does not significantly influence
this cratering rate. My dynamical models, together with the solar apex motion,
can explain the anisotropic perihelia of long period comets without needing to
invoke the existence of a Jupiter-mass solar companion. Finally, I find that
variations in the Earth's obliquity play a dominant role in triggering
terrestrial deglaciations over the past 2 Myr. The precession of the equinoxes,
in contrast, only becomes important in pacing large deglaciations after the
transition from the 100-kyr dominant periodicity in the ice coverage to a
41-kyr dominant periodicity, which occurred 0.7 Myr ago.

significant computational advantage. The first approach is based on an extended
or lifted polyhedral relaxation of the Lorentz cone by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski
(2001) that is extremely economical, but whose approximation quality cannot be
iteratively improved. The second is based on a lifted polyhedral relaxation of
the euclidean ball that can be constructed using techniques introduced by
Tawarmalani and Sahinidis (2005). This relaxation is less economical, but its
approximation quality can be iteratively improved. Unfortunately, while the
approach of Vielma, Ahmed and Nemhauser is applicable for general MICQP
problems, the approach of Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou can only be used for MICQP
problems with convex quadratic constraints. In this paper we show how a
homogenization procedure can be combined with the technique by Tawarmalani and
Sahinidis to adapt the extended formulation used by Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou
to a class of conic mixed integer programming problems that include general
MICQP problems. We then compare the effectiveness of this new extended
formulation against traditional and extended formulation-based algorithms for
MICQP. We find that this new formulation can be used to improve various
LP-based algorithms. In particular, the formulation provides an
easy-to-implement procedure that, in our benchmarks, significantly improved the
performance of commercial MICQP solvers.

luminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger for
more luminous samples. The measurements are successfully interpreted within the
halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework with central and satellite
velocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and to
model redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects. In agreement with previous
studies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes.
Including the redshift-space 2PCFs helps tighten the HOD constraints. Moreover,
we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres,
with the velocity dispersion about 30% that of the dark matter. Such a relative
motion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find that
central galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect to
their host haloes. The motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples is
consistent with their following that of the dark matter. For faint samples,
satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloes
about 85% that of the dark matter. We discuss possible applications of the

equations is based on a standard staggered-grid approach. Fluid-body
interaction is handled using Peskin's IB method; however, unlike existing IB
approaches to such problems, we do not rely on penalty or fractional-step
formulations. Instead, we use an unsplit scheme that ensures the no-slip
constraint is enforced exactly in terms of the Lagrangian velocity field
evaluated at the IB markers. Fractional-step approaches, by contrast, can
impose such constraints only approximately. Imposing these constraints exactly
requires the solution of a large linear system that includes the fluid velocity
and pressure as well as Lagrange multiplier forces that impose the motion of
the body. To solve this system efficiently, we develop a preconditioner for the
constrained IB formulation that is based on an analytical approximation to the
Schur complement. This approach is enabled by the near translational and
rotational invariance of Peskin's IB method. We demonstrate that only a few
cycles of a geometric multigrid method for the fluid equations are required in
each application of the preconditioner, and we demonstrate robust convergence
of the overall Krylov solver despite the approximations made in the
preconditioner. We apply the method to a number of test problems at zero and
finite Reynolds numbers, and we demonstrate first-order convergence of the

in the lagged covariance indicates the direction and angular velocity of the
emission pattern from the flow. Even for moderately inclined flows, the
covariance robustly estimates the flow direction, although the estimated

strikingly tight power-law relation between temperature and density that holds
over two decades in density. It is found that this relation should roughly
apply Delta z ~ 1-2 after a reionization event, and this limiting behavior has
motivated the power-law parameterizations used in most analyses of the Ly-alpha
forest. This relation has been explained by using equations linearized in the
baryonic overdensity (which does not address why a tight power-law relation
holds over two decades in density) or by equating the photoheating rate with
the cooling rate from cosmological expansion (which we show is incorrect).
Previous explanations also did not address why recombination cooling and
Compton cooling off of the cosmic microwave background, which are never
negligible, do not alter the character of this relation. We provide an
understanding for why a tight power-law relation arises for unshocked gas at
all densities for which collisional cooling is unimportant. We also use our
results to comment on (1) how quickly fluctuations in temperature redshift away
after reionization processes, (2) how much shock heating occurs in the
low-density intergalactic medium, and (3) how the temperatures of collapsing
gas parcels evolve.

However, T. Sasaki et al. proposed a quite different protocol, named
round-robin differential phase shift (RRDPS), in which the amount of
eavesdropped information is bounded without monitoring the signal disturbance.
Here, we present the first active implementation of the RRDPS protocol. In our

with 65 pulses, and the global phase of each packet is randomized. Bob uses a
1-GHz, 1-64-bit actively controlled variable-delay interferometer to realize
random switching of the different delays. Benefiting from the large pulse
number of each packet, the high stability and low insertion loss of the
interferometer, the system can distribute secret key over a distance of 90 km.

hydrogen and water to mix in all proportions. The thermodynamic behavior of the

depends on the planet's interior dynamics and its conditions of formation, in

computing history data and users' interests, show an increasing importance in
various Internet applications such as online shopping. As a well-known
recommendation method, neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering has
attracted considerable attention recently. The risk of revealing users' private
information during the process of filtering has attracted noticeable research
interests. Among the current solutions, the probabilistic techniques have shown
a powerful privacy preserving effect. When facing $k$ Nearest Neighbour attack,
all the existing methods provide no data utility guarantee, for the
introduction of global randomness. In this paper, to overcome the problem of
recommendation accuracy loss, we propose a novel approach, Partitioned
Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required prediction accuracy
while maintaining high security against $k$NN attack. We define the sum of $k$
neighbours' similarity as the accuracy metric alpha, the number of user
partitions, across which we select the $k$ neighbours, as the security metric
beta. We generalise the $k$ Nearest Neighbour attack to beta k Nearest
Neighbours attack. Differing from the existing approach that selects neighbours
across the entire candidate list randomly, our method selects neighbours from
each exclusive partition of size $k$ with a decreasing probability. Theoretical
and experimental analysis show that to provide an accuracy-assured
recommendation, our Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection method yields
a better trade-off between the recommendation accuracy and system security.

film under the effects of capillary and intermolecular forces (van der Waals
interaction). Firstly, we perform the linear stability analysis within the long
wave approximation, which shows that the inclusion of inertia does not produce
new regions of instability other than the one previously known from the usual
lubrication case. The wavelength, $\lambda_m$, corresponding to he maximum
growth, $\omega_m$, and the critical (marginal) wavelength do not change at
all. The most affected feature of the instability under an increase of the
Laplace number is the noticeable decrease of the growth rates of the unstable
modes. In order to put in evidence the effects of the bidimensional aspects of
the flow (neglected in the long wave approximation), we also calculate the
dispersion relation of the instability from the linearized version of the
complete Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation. Unlike the long wave approximation, the
bidimensional model shows that $\lambda_m$ can vary significantly with inertia
when the aspect ratio of the film is not sufficiently small. We also perform
numerical simulations of the nonlinear N-S equations and analyze to which
extent the linear predictions can be applied depending on both the amount of
inertia involved and the aspect ratio of the film.

prove the exponential convergence directly, while the existence and uniqueness
of the equilibrium point is just a direct consequence of the exponential
convergence. By using three generalized norms, we present some sufficient
conditions for the uniqueness and global exponential stability of the

measured by the Economic Complexity Index) have lower levels of income
inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate
regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and
negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to
controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export
concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that
associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI

the network of related products (or product space) to illustrate how the

to evaluate human intelligence. Verbal comprehension questions appear very
frequently in IQ tests, which measure human's verbal ability including the
understanding of the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and
the analogies among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be
solved automatically by artificial intelligence technologies, especially the
deep learning technologies that are recently developed and successfully applied
in a number of fields. However, we found that the task was quite challenging,
and simply applying existing technologies (e.g., word embedding) could not
achieve a good performance, mainly due to the multiple senses of words and the
complex relations among words. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
framework consisting of three components. First, we build a classifier to
recognize the specific type of a verbal question (e.g., analogy,
classification, synonym, or antonym). Second, we obtain distributed
representations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word embedding
method that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational
knowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries. Third, for
each type of questions, we propose a specific solver based on the obtained
distributed word representations and relation representations. Experimental
results have shown that the proposed framework can not only outperform existing
methods for solving verbal comprehension questions but also exceed the average
performance of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers involved in the study. The
results indicate that with appropriate uses of the deep learning technologies
we might be a further step closer to the human intelligence.

simulations on the demographics of flyby interactions to gauge their potential
impact on galaxy evolution. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that flybys --
an interaction where two independent halos inter-penetrate but detach at a
later time and do not merge -- occur much more frequently than previously
believed. In particular, we found that the frequency of flybys increases at low
redshift and is comparable to or even greater than the frequency of mergers for
halos $\gtrsim 10^{11} M_\odot/h$. In this paper, we classify flybys according
to their orbits and the level of perturbation exacted on both the halos
involved. We find that the majority of flybys penetrate deeper than $\sim
R_{half}$ of the primary and have an initial relative speed $\sim 1.6\times
V_{vir}$ of the primary. The typical flyby mass-ratio is $\sim 0.1$ at high $z$
for all halos, while at low $z$, massive primary halos undergo flybys with
small secondary halos. We estimate the perturbation from the flyby on both the
primary and the secondary and find that a typical flyby is mostly
non-perturbative for the primary halo. However, since a massive primary
experiences so many flybys at any given time, they are nearly continually a
victim of a perturbative event. In particular, we find flybys that cause $\sim
1\%$ change in the binding energy of a primary halo occurs $\gtrsim 1 $
Gyr$^{-1}$ for halos $> 10^{10} M_\odot/h$ for $z \lesssim 4$. Secondary halos,
on the other hand, are highly perturbed by the typical encounter, experiencing
a change in binding energy of nearly order unity. Our results imply that flybys
can drive a significant part of galaxy transformation at moderate to lower
redshifts ($z \lesssim 4$). We touch on implications for observational surveys,
mass-to-light ratios, and galaxy assembly bias.

revenue even when the agents have high value for the goods and a {\em
competitive} outcome could have generated a significant revenue. A competitive
outcome is one for which it is impossible for the seller and a subset of buyers
to `block' the auction by defecting and negotiating an outcome with higher
payoffs for themselves. This corresponds to the well-known concept of {\em
core} in cooperative game theory.
  In particular, VCG revenue is known to be not competitive when the goods
being sold have complementarities. A bottleneck here is an impossibility result
showing that there is no auction that simultaneously achieves competitive
prices (a core outcome) and incentive-compatibility.
  In this paper we try to overcome the above impossibility result by asking the
following natural question: is it possible to design an incentive-compatible
auction whose revenue is comparable (even if less) to a competitive outcome?
Towards this, we define a notion of {\em core-competitive} auctions. We say
that an incentive-compatible auction is $\alpha$-core-competitive if its
revenue is at least $1/\alpha$ fraction of the minimum revenue of a
core-outcome. We study the Text-and-Image setting. In this setting, there is an
ad slot which can be filled with either a single image ad or $k$ text ads. We
design an $O(\ln \ln k)$ core-competitive randomized auction and an
$O(\sqrt{\ln(k)})$ competitive deterministic auction for the Text-and-Image
setting. We also show that both factors are tight.

have dramatically changed our understanding of SNR evolution. To date, a dozen
of RP SNRs have been identified in the Galaxy. Here we present Suzaku deep
observations of four SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), N49, N49B, N23,
and DEM L71, for accurate determination of their plasma state. Our uniform
analysis reveals that only N49 is in the recombining state among them, which is
the first robust discovery of a RP from an extra-galactic SNR. Given that RPs
have been identified only in core-collapse SNRs, our result strongly suggests a
massive star origin of this SNR. On the other hand, no clear evidence for a RP
is confirmed in N23, from which detection of recombination lines and continua
was previously claimed. Comparing the physical properties of the RP SNRs
identified so far, we find that all of them are categorized into the
""mixed-morphology"" class and interacting with surrounding molecular clouds.
This might be a key to solve formation mechanisms of the RPs.

key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed and some protocols are

that QKD protocols are provably secure unlike cryptography based on
computational complexity assumptions. It has been believed that, to guarantee
the security of QKD, Alice and Bob have to monitor the statistics of the
measurement outcomes which are used to determine the amount of the privacy
amplification to generate a key. Recently a new type of QKD protocol, called
round robin differential phase shift (RRDPS) protocol, was proposed, and
remarkably this protocol can generate a key without monitoring any statistics
of the measurement outcomes. Here we report an experimental realization of the
RRDPS protocol. We used a setup in which Bob randomly chooses one from four
interferometers with different pulse delays so that he could implement phase
difference measurements for all possible combinations with five-pulse time-bin
states. Using the setup, we successfully distributed keys over 30 km of fiber,
making this the first QKD experiment that does not rely on signal disturbance
monitoring.

processes, however, the size of the class of these models is large.
Functional-coefficient autoregressive models (FCAR) are useful structures for
reducing the size of the class of these models. Although this structure reduces
the class of nonlinear models, it is broad enough to include some common time
series models as specific cases. A recent development in estimating nonlinear
time series data is the spline backfitted kernel (SBK) method. This method
combines the computational speed of splines with the asymptotic properties of
kernel smoothing. To estimate a component function in the model, all other
component functions are pre-estimated with splines and then the difference is
taken of the observed time series and the pre-estimates. This difference is
then used as pseudo-responses for which kernel smoothing is used to estimate
the function of interest. By constructing the estimates in this way, the method
does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we adapt the
SBK method to FCAR models.

following practical application: given a user photo depicting a clothing image,
our goal is to retrieve the same or attribute-similar clothing items from

discrepancy between online shopping images, usually taken in ideal
lighting/pose/background conditions, and user photos captured in uncontrolled

Network (DARN) for retrieval feature learning. More specifically, DARN consists
of two sub-networks, one for each domain, whose retrieval feature
representations are driven by semantic attribute learning. We show that this
attribute-guided learning is a key factor for retrieval accuracy improvement.
In addition, to further align with the nature of the retrieval problem, we
impose a triplet visual similarity constraint for learning to rank across the
two sub-networks. Another contribution of our work is a large-scale dataset
which makes the network learning feasible. We exploit customer review websites
to crawl a large set of online shopping images and corresponding offline user
photos with fine-grained clothing attributes, i.e., around 450,000 online
shopping images and about 90,000 exact offline counterpart images of those
online ones. All these images are collected from real-world consumer websites
reflecting the diversity of the data modality, which makes this dataset unique

performance of networks in different configurations. The top-20 retrieval
accuracy is doubled when using the proposed DARN other than the current popular

both the eyes in the same direction. SR is the ratio of peak saccadic velocity

estimation of PERCLOS and SR, prevailing in the literature such as illumination
variation, poor illumination conditions, head rotations etc. In this work,
algorithms for real-time PERCLOS computation has been developed and implemented
on an embedded platform. The platform has been used as a case study for
assessment of loss of attention in automotive drivers. The SR estimation has
been carried out offline as real-time implementation requires high frame rates
of processing which is difficult to achieve due to hardware limitations. The
accuracy in estimation of the loss of attention using PERCLOS and SR has been
validated using brain signals, which are reported to be an authentic cue for

nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) hierarchy as a discrete spectral problem, wherein
the two intermediate potentials appearing in the Darboux matrix are considered

problem with a suitable isospectral time-evolution equation, which forms the
Lax-pair representation for a space-discrete NLS system. This formulation is
valid for the most general case where the two dependent variables take values
in (rectangular) matrices. In contrast to the matrix generalization of the
Ablowitz-Ladik lattice, our discretization has a rational nonlinearity and
admits a Hermitian conjugation reduction between the two dependent variables.
Thus, a new proper space-discretization of the vector/matrix NLS equation is
obtained; by changing the time part of the Lax pair, we also obtain an
integrable space-discretization of the vector/matrix modified KdV (mKdV)
equation. Because B\""acklund-Darboux transformations are permutable, we can
increase the number of discrete independent variables in a multi-dimensionally

high Curie temperature ($T_C$) of 700 - 900 K. However, a such estimate of

calculated x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra to the experimental
features seen for BaFeO$_3$, we concluded that the presence of oxygen vacancies
in our model enables a good agreement. Thus, the relatively low $T_C$ measured
in BaFeO$_3$ can be explained by oxygen vacancies intrinsically presented in
the material. Since iron species near the O vacancy change their oxidation
state from $4+$ to $3+$, the interaction between Fe$^{4+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$, which
is antiferromagnetic, weakens the effective magnetic interaction in the system,
which is predominantly ferromagnetic. With increasing $\delta$ in
BaFeO$_{3-\delta}$, its $T_C$ decreases down to the critical value when the
magnetic order becomes antiferromagnetic. Our calculations of the electronic
structure of BaFeO$_{3-\delta}$ illustrate how the ferromagnetism originates

solution set of both the primal and dual problems using their associated
Kuhn-Tucker set, and then develop a projected method to successively
approximate a feasible point of the Kuhn-Tucker set. We propose a splitting
algorithm based on the resolvent of each maximally monotone operator to
construct a primal-dual sequence that weakly converges to a solution of the
original problem. The key feature of our method is that it only employes the
resolvent of each monotone operator separately, which is different from
existing methods in the literature. As a byproduct, our algorithm can be
specialized to solve composite convex minimization problems that uses the
proximal-operator of each objective component independently, and is equipped
with a weakly convergence guarantee.

remaining 94% were due to galactic cosmic rays. During the maximum period of
cycle 23 (2000 Jan 1 -- 2003 Dec 31), the SEP contribution increased to 22%,
and during 2001, the year with the highest SEP rate, to 30%. About 40% of the
total solar array degradation during the 17 years from Jan 1996 through Feb
2013 can be attributed to proton events, i.e. the effect of a series of
short-lived, violent SEP events is comparable to the cycle-integrated damage by
cosmic rays.

shed light into the subject and some years ago this has been done through a
search for a rotational signature at the jet line spectrum. The existence of
such signatures, however, remains controversial. In order to contribute to the
clarification of this issue, in this paper we show that the Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) can potentially help to distinguish between rotation and
precession effects in protostellar jet images. We apply the PCA to synthetic
spectro-imaging datacubes generated as an output of numerical simulations of
protostellar jets. In this way we generate a benchmark to which a PCA
diagnostics of real observations can be confronted. Using the computed emission
line profiles for [O I]6300A and [S II]6716A, we recover and analyze the
effects of rotation and precession in tomograms generated by PCA. We show that
different combinations of the eigenvectors can be used to enhance and to
identify the rotation features present in the data. Our results indicate that
the PCA can be useful for disentangling rotation from precession in jets with
an inclination of the jet with respect to the plane of the sky as high as 45
degrees. We have been able to recover the initially imposed rotation jet
profile for models at moderate inclination angle (< 15 degrees) and without
precession (abridged).

Here, we present new astrometric and spectroscopic observations that allow us
to characterise the system in detail. The optical spectrum shows LiI-absorption
indicative of a young age and/or substellar mass for the primary component. The
near-infrared spectrum is best reproduced by a binary system of brown dwarfs
with spectral types of L1.5 $+$ L5.5 and effective temperatures of $2150\pm100$
K and $1670\pm140$ K. To conform with the photocentric orbit size measured with
astrometry and the current understanding of substellar evolution, the system
must have an age in the 80--500 Myr range. Evolutionary models predict
component masses in the ranges of $M_1\simeq0.028-0.063\,M_\odot$ and
$M_2\simeq0.018-0.045\,M_\odot$ with a mass ratio of $q\simeq0.64-0.74$.
Multi-epoch radial velocity measurements unambiguously establish the
three-dimensional orbit of the system and allow us to investigate its kinematic
properties. DE0823$-$49 emerges as a rare example of a nearby brown dwarf
binary with orbit, component properties, and age that are characterised well.

benefit for other dual-species experiments. The tunability of the scattering
length was used to perform precision spectroscopy of the interspecies Feshbach

energetic particles accelerated at heliospheric shocks can be anomalous, i.e.
the mean square displacement can grow non-linearly in time. In particular, a
new analysis technique has permitted the study of particle transport properties
from energetic particle time profiles upstream of interplanetary shocks.
Indeed, the time/spatial power laws of the differential intensity upstream of
several shocks are indicative of superdiffusion. A complete determination of
the key parameters of superdiffusive transport comprises the power-law index,
the superdiffusion coefficient, the related transition scale at which the
energetic particle profiles turn to decay as power laws, and the energy
spectral index of the shock accelerated particles. Assuming large-scale spatial
homogeneity of the background plasma, the power-law behaviour can been derived
from both a (microscopic) propagator formalism and a (macroscopic) fractional
transport equation. We compare the two approaches and find a relation between
the diffusion coefficients used in the two formalisms. Based on the assumption
of superdiffusive transport, we quantitatively derive these parameters by
studying energetic particle profiles observed by the Ulysses and Voyager 2
spacecraft upstream of shocks in the heliosphere, for which a superdiffusive
particle transport has previously been observed. Further, we have jointly
studied the electron energy spectra, comparing the values of the spectral
indices observed with those predicted by the standard diffusive shock
acceleration theory and by a model based on superdiffusive transport. For a
number of interplanetary shocks and for the solar wind termination shock, for

changing the fractal dimension, D, from the original three dimensional case to

rate is exactly the topological entropy of the flow. We also show that taking
only the shortest orbit representatives in each conjugacy classes still yields
Bowen's version of the measure of maximal entropy. These results are achieved
by obtaining counting results on the growth rate of the number of periodic
orbits inside a free homotopy class. In the first part of the article, we also
construct many examples of Anosov flows having some finite and some infinite

local couplings between the electronic charge and lattice displacements. An
effective action for the spin and lattice variables is constructed in which the

phylogenetic inference because it provides a point of reference for polarising

allowing the position of the root to be another unknown in the model. We
propose two hierarchical models that are centred on a reversible model but
perturbed to allow non-reversibility. The models differ in the degree of

performance of the two non-reversible models in analyses of simulated data sets

spectra taken in 5 years of quiescence time. We study the line profile
variability and the radial velocity of the metallic emission lines. We use the
velocity signatures of different species with various excitation conditions and
their time dependency to track the dynamics associated to accretion. We observe
periodic velocity variations in the line components consistent with rotational
modulation. The modulation is stronger for lines with higher excitation
potentials. We propose that the narrow line components are produced in the
post-shock region, while the broad components originate in the more extended,
pre-shock material. All the emission lines suffer velocity modulation due to
the rotation of the star. The broad components are responsible for the
line-dependent veiling observed in EX Lupi. Rotationally-modulated
line-dependent veiling can explain the radial velocity signatures, making the
close-in companion hypothesis unnecessary. The accretion structure is locked to
the star and very stable during the 5 years of observations. Not all stars with
similar spectral types and accretion rates show the same metallic emission
lines, maybe related to differences in temperature and density in their
accretion structure(s). The contamination of photospheric lines by accretion
processes can be turned into a very useful tool to determine the innermost
details of the accretion channels in the proximities of the star. Emission
lines from very stable accretion columns will nevertheless be a very strong
limitation for the detection of companions by radial velocity in young stars.

charged pions detected in opposite jets from electron-positron annihilation.
These correlations may arise from the dependence of the di-pion fragmentation
on the polarization of the parent quark in the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow q
\bar{q}$. Due to the correlation of the quark polarizations, the cross-section
of di-pion pair production, in which the pion pairs are detected in opposite
jets in a dijet event, exhibits a modulation in the azimuthal angles of the
planes containing the hadron pairs with respect to the production plane. The
measurement of this modulation allows access to combinations of fragmentation
functions that are sensitive to the quark's transverse polarization and
helicity. Within our uncertainties we do not observe a significant signal from
the previously unmeasured helicity dependent fragmentation function
$G_1^\perp$. This measurement uses a dataset of 938~fb$^{-1}$ collected by the
Belle experiment at or near $\sqrt{s}\approx10.58$ GeV.

configuration of molecules one needs to solve the Schr\""odinger equation.
Repeating this for many different configurations allows one to determine the
potential energy surface (PES) and the dipole moment surface (DMS). Since the
early days of computer simulation it has been implicitly accepted that for
empirical potentials the charges used to fit the PES should also be used to
describe the DMS. This is a mistake. Partial charges are not observable
magnitudes. They should be regarded as adjustable fitting parameters. Optimal
values used to describe the PES are not necessarily the best to describe the
DMS. One could use two fits: one for the PES, and another for the DMS. This is
a common practice in the quantum chemistry community, but not used so often by
the community performing computer simulations. This idea affects all types of
modelling of water (with the exception of ab-initio calculations) from coarse
grained to non-polarizable and polarizable models. We anticipate that an area
that will benefit dramatically from having both, a good PES and a good DMS, is
the modelling of water in the presence of electric fields.

in the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronous
modulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use the
orbital component, rather than adopting the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) solar dipole. This allows our 2015 LFI analysis to provide an
independent Solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that of
HFI and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the WMAP value. This 0.3% shift
in the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from WMAP and a global overhaul of the
iterative calibration code increases the overall level of the LFI maps by 0.45%

2013 Planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrum
measured by WMAP. We estimate that the LFI calibration uncertainty is now at
the level of 0.20% for the 70 GHz map, 0.26% for the 44 GHz map, and 0.35% for

According to experimental results, this work analyzes the proportion of

platform. The optimization focuses on the bottleneck of the program - SpMV
kernel, and uses an efficient storage format named BCRS. Moreover, an improving

hadrons), to the estimation of Missing Higher-Order Uncertainties
(MHOUs)(hep-ph/1307.1843) in perturbation theory. The behavior of the models is
determined by analyzing, on a wide set of observables, how the MHOU intervals
they produce are successful in predicting the next orders. We observe that the
Bayesian model behaves consistently, producing intervals at $68\%$ Degree of
Belief (DoB) comparable with the scale variation intervals with a rescaling
factor $r$ larger than $2$ and closer to $4$. Concerning SV, our analysis
allows the derivation of a heuristic Confidence Level (CL) for the intervals.
We find that assigning a CL of $68\%$ to the intervals obtained with the
conventional choice of varying the scales within a factor of two with respect
to the central scale could potentially lead to an underestimation of the
uncertainties in the case of observables with initial state hadrons.

as a simple model of the dynamics of ferromagnetism. Vertices in a graph can be
in one of two states: `healthy' or `infected' and from an initial configuration
of states, healthy vertices become infected by local rules. While the usual
bootstrap processes are monotone in the sets of infected vertices, in this
paper, a modification is examined in which infected vertices can return to a
healthy state. Vertices are initially infected independently at random and the
central question is whether all vertices eventually become infected. The model
examined here is such a process on a square grid for which healthy vertices
with at least two infected neighbours become infected and infected vertices
with no infected neighbours become healthy. Sharp thresholds are given for the
critical probability of initial infections for all vertices eventually to

the computation of (i) an extended formulation of size $r$ of a polytope $P$,

number (also known as the boolean rank) of the slack matrix of the $n$-gons.
The upper bound is a slight improvement of the result of Fiorini, Rothvoss and
Tiwary [Extended Formulations for Polygons, Discrete Comput. Geom. 48(3), pp.
658-668, 2012]. The difference with their result is twofold: (i) our proof uses
a purely algebraic argument while Fiorini et al. used a geometric argument, and
(ii) we improve the base case allowing us to reduce their upper bound $2
\left\lceil \log_2(n) \right\rceil$ by one when $2^{k-1} < n \leq
2^{k-1}+2^{k-2}$ for some integer $k$. We conjecture that this new upper bound
is tight, which is suggested by numerical experiments for small $n$. Moreover,
this improved upper bound allows us to close the gap with the best known lower
bound for certain regular $n$-gons (namely, $9 \leq n \leq 13$ and $21 \leq n

structures as they are defined by a planar mask. The realisation of
three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures by etching requires technologies beyond
planar masks. We present a method to fabricate a 3D mask that allows to etch
three-dimensional monolithic nanostructures by using only CMOS-compatible
processes. The mask is written in a hard-mask layer that is deposited on two
adjacent inclined surfaces of a Si wafer. By projecting in single step two
different 2D patterns within one 3D mask on the two inclined surfaces, the
mutual alignment between the patterns is ensured. Thereby after the mask
pattern is defined, the etching of deep pores in two oblique directions yields
a three-dimensional structure in Si. As a proof of concept we demonstrate 3D
mask fabrication for three-dimensional diamond-like photonic band gap crystals
in silicon. The fabricated crystals reveal a broad stop gap in optical
reflectivity measurements. We propose how 3D nanostructures with five different
Bravais lattices can be realised, namely cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic,
monoclinic, and hexagonal, and demonstrate a mask for a 3D hexagonal crystal.
We also demonstrate the mask for a diamond-structure crystal with a 3D array of
cavities. In general, the 2D patterns for the different surfaces can be
completely independent and still be in perfect mutual alignment. Indeed, we
observe an alignment accuracy of better than 3.0 nm between the 2D mask
patterns on the inclined surfaces, which permits one to etch well-defined
monolithic 3D nanostructures.

parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as
surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches
only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often,
it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to
explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing
facilities are available. These facilities could be computational or physical
facets of the process being optimized. E.g. in biological experiments many
experimental set ups allow several samples to be simultaneously processed.
Batch methods, however, require modeling of the interaction between the
evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We
investigate a simple heuristic based on an estimate of the Lipschitz constant
that captures the most important aspect of this interaction (i.e. local
repulsion) at negligible computational overhead. The resulting algorithm
compares well, in running time, with much more elaborate alternatives. The
approach assumes that the function of interest, $f$, is a Lipschitz continuous
function. A wrap-loop around the acquisition function is used to collect
batches of points of certain size minimizing the non-parallelizable
computational effort. The speed-up of our method with respect to previous
approaches is significant in a set of computationally expensive experiments.

the `Gravitational Wave Universe'. Within this call, a mission concept called
eLISA has been proposed. This observatory has a current initial configuration
consisting of 4 laser links between the three satellites, which are separated
by a distance of one million kilometers, constructing a single channel
Michelson interferometer. However, the final configuration for the observatory
will not be fixed until the end of this decade. With this in mind, we
investigate the effect of different eLISA-like configurations on massive black
hole detections. This work compares the results of a Bayesian inference study
of 120 massive black hole binaries out to a redshift of $z\sim13$ for a $10^6$m
arm-length eLISA with four and six links, as well as a $2\times10^6$m
arm-length observatory with four links. We demonstrate that the original eLISA
configuration should allow us to recover the luminosity distance of the source
with an error of less than 10% out to a redshift of $z\sim4$, and a sky error
box of $\leq10^2\,deg^2$ out to $z\sim0.1$. In contrast, both alternative
configurations suggest that we should be able to conduct the same parameter
recovery with errors of less than 10% in luminosity distance out to $z\sim12$
and $\leq10^2\,deg^2$ out to $z\sim0.4$. Using the information from these
studies, we also infer that if we were able to construct a 2Gm, 6-link
detector, the above values would shift to $z\sim20$ for luminosity distance and
$z\sim0.9$ for sky error. While the final configuration will also be dependent
on both technological and financial considerations, our study suggests that
increasing the size of a two arm detector is a viable alternative to the
inclusion of a third arm in a smaller detector. More importantly, this work
further suggests no clear scientific loss between either choice.

anti-center sample containing $\sim$ 4,400 AFGK dwarfs and red clump stars
within windows of a few degree wide centered on the Galactic anti-center. The
global sample is used to construct a three-dimensional map of bulk motions of
the Galactic disk from the solar vicinity out to $\sim$ 2 kpc with a spatial
resolution of $\sim$ 250 pc. Typical values of the radial and vertical
components of bulk motion range from $-$15 km s$^{-1}$ to 15 km s$^{-1}$, while
the lag behind the circular speed dominates the azimuthal component by up to
$\sim$ 15 km s$^{-1}$. The map reveals spatially coherent, kpc-scale stellar
flows in the disk, with typical velocities of a few tens km s$^{-1}$. Bending-
and breathing-mode perturbations are clearly visible, and vary smoothly across
the disk plane. Our data also reveal higher-order perturbations, such as breaks
and ripples, in the profiles of vertical motion versus height. From the local
sample, we find that stars of different populations exhibit very different
patterns of bulk motion. Finally, the anti-center sample reveals a number of
peaks in stellar number density in the line-of-sight velocity versus distance
distribution, with the nearer ones apparently related to the known moving
groups. The ""velocity bifurcation"" reported by Liu et al. (2012) at

how to best distinguish a dark matter signal from neutrinos will become
increasingly important. A proposed method of overcoming this so-called
'neutrino floor' is to utilize the directional signature that both neutrino and
dark matter induced recoils possess. We show that directional experiments can
indeed probe WIMP-nucleon cross-sections below the neutrino floor with little
loss in sensitivity due to the neutrino background. In particular we find at
low WIMP masses (around 6 GeV) the discovery limits for directional detectors
penetrate below the non-directional limit by several orders of magnitude. For
high WIMP masses (around 100 GeV), the non-directional limit is overcome by a
factor of a few. Furthermore we show that even for directional detectors which
can only measure 1- or 2-dimensional projections of the 3-dimensional recoil
track, the discovery potential is only reduced by a factor of 3 at most. We
also demonstrate that while the experimental limitations of directional
detectors, such as sense recognition and finite angular resolution, have a
detrimental effect on the discovery limits, it is still possible to overcome
the ultimate neutrino background faced by non-directional detectors.

gradients. Our results show that the gradients, both in the radial and vertical
directions, exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. The radial
gradients yielded by stars of oldest ages (>11 Gyr) are essentially zero at all
heights from the disk midplane, while those given by younger stars are always
negative. The vertical gradients deduced from stars of oldest ages (>11Gyr) are
negative and show only very weak variations with the Galactocentric distance in
the disk plane, $R$, while those yielded by younger stars show strong
variations with $R$. After being essentially flat at the earliest epochs of
disk formation, the radial gradients steepen as age decreases, reaching a
maxima (steepest) at age 7-8 Gyr, and then they flatten again. Similar temporal
trends are also found for the vertical gradients. We infer that the assemblage
of the Milky Way disk may have experienced at least two distinct phases. The
earlier phase is probably related to a slow, pressure-supported collapse of
gas, when the gas settles down to the disk mainly in the vertical direction. In
the later phase, there are significant radial flows of gas in the disk, and the
rate of gas inflow near the solar neighborhood reaches a maximum around a
lookback time of 7-8 Gyr. The transition of the two phases occurs around a
lookback time between 8 and 11 Gyr. The two phases may be responsible for the
formation of the Milky Way thick and thin disks, respectively. And, as a
consequence, we recommend that stellar age is a natural, physical criterion to
distinguish thin and thick disk stars. ... (abridged)

arises when a linear transformation, $p_{T} \rightarrow p_{T}/K$, is applied on
the pion, kaon or proton $p_{T}$ spectra. The scaling parameter $K$ depends on
$\sqrt{s}$ and is determined by a new method, the quality factor method, which
does not rely on the shape of the scaling function. We argue that the pions,
kaons and protons originate from different distributions of clusters which are
formed by strings overlapping, and the scaling behaviours of these identified
particles $p_{T}$ spectra could be understood with the colour string
percolation model in a quantitative way simultaneously.

as combination of smaller ones with auxiliary data array transpose functions),
one can hope to compute analytically the size of the largest FFT that can be
performed locally on an elementary GPU compute block. Then, the full
application must be organized around this given building block size. Now, due
to phenomena involved in the data transfers between various memory levels
across CPUs and GPUs, the optimality of such a scheme is only loosely

a stochastic signal model over a deterministic signal model. A signal can
further be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is
favored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between
several signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated
Gaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an
astrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources. For simplicity, we
consider co-located and co-aligned detectors with white detector noise, but the
method can be extended to more realistic detector configurations and power
spectra. The general trend we observe is that a deterministic model is favored
for small source numbers, a non-Gaussian stochastic model is preferred for
intermediate source numbers, and a Gaussian stochastic model is preferred for
large source numbers. However, there is very large variation between individual
signal realizations, leading to fuzzy boundaries between the three regimes. We
find that a hybrid, trans-dimensional model comprised of a deterministic signal
model for individual bright sources and a Gaussian-stochastic signal model for

contributions to resolve the geometry of the emitting region and determine the

the hard X-ray band (25-240 keV), with a Pathfinder mission focussing on Crab
observations. Within the polarimeter, the distribution of Compton scattering
angles is used to determine the polarisation fraction and angle of incident
photons. To assure an unbiased measurement of the polarisation during a balloon
flight it is crucial to characterise the performance of the instrument before
the launch. This paper presents the results of the PoGOLite calibration tests
and simulations performed before the 2013 balloon flight. The tests performed
confirm that the polarimeter does not have any intrinsic asymmetries and
therefore does not induce bias into the measurements. Generally, good agreement
is found between results from test data and simulations which allows the
polarimeter performance to be estimated for Crab observations.

recommender systems. However, the risks of revealing customers' privacy during
the process of filtering have attracted noticeable public concern recently.
Specifically, $k$NN attack discloses the target user's sensitive information by
creating $k$ fake nearest neighbours by non-sensitive information. Among the
current solutions against $k$NN attack, the probabilistic methods showed a
powerful privacy preserving effect. However, the existing probabilistic methods
neither guarantee enough prediction accuracy due to the global randomness, nor
provide assured security enforcement against $k$NN attack. To overcome the
problems of current probabilistic methods, we propose a novel approach,
Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required security
guarantee while achieving the optimal prediction accuracy against $k$NN attack.
In this paper, we define the sum of $k$ neighbours' similarity as the accuracy
metric $\alpha$, the number of user partitions, across which we select the $k$
neighbours, as the security metric $\beta$. Differing from the present methods
that globally selected neighbours, our method selects neighbours from each
group with exponential differential privacy to decrease the magnitude of noise.
Theoretical and experimental analysis show that to achieve the same security

accuracy.

  of a Twitter Small-World Network, Social Networking 4(2), p.33-40","2015 Social Networking 4(2), p.33-40",,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The small-world phenomenon is found in many self-organising systems. Systems
configured in small-world networks spread information more easily than in
random or regular lattice-type networks. Whilst it is a known fact that
small-world networks have short average path length and high clustering
coefficient in self-organising systems, the ego centralities that maintain the
cohesiveness of small-world network have not been formally defined. Here we
show that instantaneous events such as the release of news items via Twitter,
coupled with active community arguments related to the news item form a
particular type of small-world network. Analysis of the centralities in the
network reveals that community arguments maintain the small-world network
whilst actively maintaining the cohesiveness and boundary of the group. The
results demonstrate how an active Twitter community unconsciously forms a
small-world network whilst interacting locally with a bordering community. Over
time, such local interactions brought about the global emergence of the
small-world network, connecting media channels with human activities.
Understanding the small-world phenomenon in relation to online social or civic
movement is important, as evident in the spate of online activists that tipped
the power of governments for the better or worst in recent times. The support,
or removal of high centrality nodes in such networks has important
ramifications in the self-expression of society and civic discourses. The
presentation in this article anticipates further exploration of man-made
self-organising systems where a larger cluster of ad-hoc and active community
maintains the overall cohesiveness of the network.
