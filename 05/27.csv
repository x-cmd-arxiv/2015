geomagnetic disturbance ever recorded at low latitudes related to solar
activity: the Carrington storm. This paper describes a geomagnetic disturbance
case with a profile extraordinarily similar to the disturbance of the
Carrington event at Colaba: the event on 29 October 2003 at Tihany magnetic
observatory in Hungary. The analysis of the H-field at different locations
during the ""Carrington-like"" event leads to a re-interpretation of the 1859
event. The major conclusions of the paper are the following: (a) the global Dst
or SYM-H, as indices based on averaging, missed the largest geomagnetic
disturbance in the 29 October 2003 event and might have missed the 1859
disturbance, since the large spike in the horizontal component (H) of
terrestrial magnetic field depends strongly on magnetic local time (MLT); (b)
the main cause of the large drop in H recorded at Colaba during the Carrington
storm was not the ring current but field-aligned currents (FACs), and (c) the
very local signatures of the H-spike imply that a Carrington-like event can
occur more often than expected.

modern CMB polarization experiments require a robust calibration program that
will allow the effects of instrument-induced signals to be mitigated during

with polarization properties known to adequate precision does not exist.
Therefore, we designed a space-based millimeter-wave calibration instrument,
called CalSat, to serve as an open-access calibrator, and this paper describes
the results of our design study. The calibration source on board CalSat is
composed of five ""tones"" with one each at 47.1, 80.0, 140, 249 and 309 GHz. The
five tones we chose are well matched to (i) the observation windows in the
atmospheric transmittance spectra, (ii) the spectral bands commonly used in
polarimeters by the CMB community, and (iii) The Amateur Satellite Service
bands in the Table of Frequency Allocations used by the Federal Communications
Commission. CalSat would be placed in a polar orbit allowing visibility from
observatories in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Mauna Kea in Hawaii and
Summit Station in Greenland, and the Southern Hemisphere, such as the Atacama
Desert in Chile and the South Pole. CalSat also would be observable by
balloon-borne instruments launched from a range of locations around the world.
This global visibility makes CalSat the only source that can be observed by all
terrestrial and sub-orbital observatories, thereby providing a universal
standard that permits comparison between experiments using appreciably
different measurement approaches.

below the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature $T_\mathrm{BG}$, the electron-phonon

the graphene electron-lattice deformation potential. We also present results
for thermal conductance at higher temperatures, above $T_\mathrm{BG}/4$, for
which the clean limit no longer applies. In this regime we find a cooling power
which is accurately described qualitatively, but not quantitatively, by a model

introducing a magnetic equivalent of residual resistance in the system. Here we
propose that oxygen deficiency is the leading cause of magnetic impurities in
as-grown samples, and we determine the defect structure and magnetism in
Y2Ti2O(7-\delta) using diffuse neutron scattering and magnetization
measurements. These defects are eliminated by oxygen annealing. The
introduction of oxygen vacancies causes Ti4+ to transform to magnetic Ti3+ with
quenched orbital magnetism, but the concentration is anomalously low. In the
spin-ice material Dy2Ti2O7 we find that the same oxygen-vacancy defects
suppress moments on neighbouring rare-earth sites, and that these magnetic
distortions dramatically slow down the long-time monopole dynamics at
sub-Kelvin temperatures.

with a sheet on the basis of the Klimchitskaya-Mostepanenko theory. We find the
result that for non-trivial susceptibility values of the sheet and
micro-particle, there is crossover between attractive and repulsive behavior.
The transition depends only on the impedance, involving permeability and
permittivity, apart from the ratio of the film thickness and the micro-particle
separation (D/d) and temperature. The approach to calculate CPI of a
micro-particle with a silicene sheet involves replacing the dielectric constant
of the sample by the static dielectric function obtained using the expressions
for the polarization function. The silicene is described by the low-energy
Liu-Yao-Feng-Ezawa (LYFE)Model Hamiltonian involving the Dirac matrices in the
chiral representation obeying the Clifford algebra.We find that the collective
charge excitations at zero doping, i.e., intrinsic plasmons, in this system,
are absent in the Dirac limit. The valley-spin-split intrinsic plasmons,
however, come into being in the case of the massive Dirac particles with
characteristic frequency close to 10 THz.Furthermore, there is a longitudinal
electric field induced topological insulator(TI) to spin-valley polarized metal
(SVPM) transition in silicene, which is also referred to as the topological
phase transition (TPT). The low-energy SVP carriers at TPT possess gap-less
(mass-less) and gapped (massive) energy spectra close to the two nodal points
in the Brillouin zone with maximum spin-polarization. We find that the
magnitude of the Casimir-Polder force at a given ratio of the film thickness
and the separation between the micro-particle and the film is greater at TPT
than at the topological insulator and trivial insulator phases.

planet comparable to our Earth has been discovered so far. The search for an
Exo-Earth is certainly a big challenge which may require the detections of
planetary systems resembling our Solar system in order to find life like on
Earth. However, even if we find Solar system analogues, it is not certain that
a planet in Earth position will have similar circumstances as those of Earth.
Small changes in the architecture of the giant planets can lead to orbital
perturbations which may change the conditions of habitability for a terrestrial
planet in the habitable zone (HZ). We present a numerical investigation where
we first study the motion of test-planets in a particular Jupiter-Saturn
configuration for which we can expect strong gravitational perturbations on the
motion at Earth position according to a previous work. In this study, we show
that these strong perturbations can be reduced significantly by the neighboring
planets of Earth. In the second part of our study we investigate the motion of
test-planets in inclined Jupiter-Saturn systems where we analyze changes in the
dynamical behavior of the inner planetary system. Moderate values of
inclination seem to counteract the perturbations in the HZ while high
inclinations induce more chaos in this region. Finally, we carry out a
stability study of the actual orbits of Venus, Earth and Mars moving in the
inclined Jupiter-Saturn systems for which we used the Solar system parameters.
This study shows that the three terrestrial planets will only move in
low-eccentric orbits if Saturn's inclination is <=10{\deg}. Therefore, it seems
that it is advantageous for the habitability of Earth when all planets move
nearly in the same plane.

meshes by a posteriori error estimates based on metrics, studied on the case of
a nonlinear finite element minimization scheme for the Landau-de Gennes free
energy functional of nematic liquid crystals. Newton's iteration for tensor
fields is employed with steepest descent method possibly stepping in.
  Aspects relating the driving of mesh adaptivity within the nonlinear scheme
are considered. The algorithmic performance is found to depend on at least two
factors: when to trigger each single mesh adaptation, and the precision of the
correlated remeshing. Each factor is represented by a parameter, with its
values possibly varying for every new mesh adaptation. We empirically show that
the time of the overall algorithm convergence can vary considerably when
different sequences of parameters are used, thus posing a question about
optimality.
  The extensive testings and debugging done within this work on the simulation
of systems of nematic colloids substantially contributed to the upgrade of an
open source finite element-oriented programming language to its 3D meshing
possibilities, as also to an outer 3D remeshing module.

important source of divergence across taxa. Using a paired-end read approach
with Illumina sequence data for archaic humans, I identify changes in genome
structure that occurred recently in human evolution. Hundreds of rearrangements
indicate genomic trafficking between the sex chromosomes and autosomes, raising
the possibility of sex-specific changes. Additionally, genes adjacent to genome
structure changes in Neanderthals are associated with testis-specific
expression, consistent with evolutionary theory that new genes commonly form
with expression in the testes. I identify one case of new-gene creation through
transposition from the Y chromosome to chromosome 10 that combines the 5' end
of the testis-specific gene Fank1 with previously untranscribed sequence. This
new transcript experienced copy number expansion in archaic genomes, indicating
rapid genomic change. Among rearrangements identified in Neanderthals, 13% are
transposition of selfish genetic elements, while 32% appear to be ectopic
exchange between repeats. In Denisovan, the pattern is similar but numbers are
significantly higher with 18% of rearrangements reflecting transposition and
40% ectopic exchange between distantly related repeats. There is an excess of
divergent rearrangements relative to polymorphism in Denisovan, which might
result from non-uniform rates of mutation, possibly reflecting a burst of TE
activity in the lineage that led to Denisovan. Finally, loci containing genome
structure changes show diminished rates of introgression from Neanderthals into
modern humans, consistent with the hypothesis that rearrangements serve as
barriers to gene flow during hybridization. Together, these results suggest
that this previously unidentified source of genomic variation has important
biological consequences in human evolution.

the assembly history of galaxies. Finding observational evidence of very low
mass classical bulges particularly in barred galaxies including our Milky Way,
is a challenging task as the bar driven secular evolution might bring
significant dynamical change to these bulges alongside the stellar disk.
  Using high-resolution N-body simulation, we show that if a cool stellar disk
is assembled around a non-rotating low-mass classical bulge, the disk rapidly
grows a strong bar within a few rotation time scales. Later, the bar driven
secular process transform the initial classical bulge into a flattened rotating
stellar system whose central part also have grown a bar-like component rotating
in sync with the disk bar. During this time, a boxy/peanut (hereafter, B/P)
bulge is formed via the buckling instability of the disk bar and the vertical
extent of this B/P bulge being slightly higher than that of the classical
bulge, it encompasses the whole classical bulge. The resulting composite bulge
appears to be both photometrically and kinematically identical to a B/P bulge
without any obvious signature of the classical component. Our analysis suggest
that many barred galaxies in the local universe might be hiding such low-mass
classical bulges. We suggest that stellar population and chemodynamical
analysis might be required in establishing the evidence for such low-mass
classical bulges.

al. that all 2D systems must be insulating. The existence of a metallic state
for such a wide range of 2D systems thus reveals a wide gap in our
understanding of 2D transport that has become more important as research in 2D
systems expands. A key to understanding the 2D metallic state is the
metal-insulator transition (MIT). In this report, we demonstrate the existence
of a disorder induced MIT in functionalized graphene, a model 2D system.
Magneto-transport measurements show that weak-localization overwhelmingly
drives the transition, in contradiction to theoretical assumptions that
enhanced electron-electron interactions dominate. These results provide the
first detailed picture of the nature of the transition from the metallic to

how measuring the population dynamics using tr-ARPES can be used to separate
electron-boson interactions from electron-electron interactions. We demonstrate
the analysis of a well-defined electron-boson interaction in the unoccupied

electric charge of the up and down quarks. These effects represent a
perturbation of hadronic amplitudes at the percent level. Although these
contributions are small, they play a crucial role in hadronic and nuclear
physics. Moreover, as lattice computations are becoming increasingly precise,
it is becoming more and more important to include these effects in numerical
simulations. We summarize here how to properly define QCD and QED on a finite
and discrete space-time so that isospin corrections to hadronic observables can
be computed ab-initio and we review the main results on the isospin corrections
to the hadron spectrum. We mainly focus on the recent work going beyond the
electro-quenched approximation.

semiconductors, black arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP), with highly tunable chemical
compositions and electronic and optical properties. Transport and infrared
absorption studies demonstrate the semiconducting nature of b-AsP with tunable
bandgaps, ranging from 0.3 to 0.15 eV. These bandgaps fall into long-wavelength
infrared (LWIR) regime and cannot be readily reached by other layered
materials. Moreover, polarization-resolved infrared absorption and Raman
studies reveal in-plane anisotropic properties of b-AsP. This family of layered

radio network operator. Efficient coverage optimization requires accurate
coverage estimation. This estimation relies on geo-located field measurements
which are gathered today during highly expensive drive tests (DT); and will be
reported in the near future by users' mobile devices thanks to the 3GPP
Minimizing Drive Tests (MDT) feature~\cite{3GPPproposal}. This feature consists
in an automatic reporting of the radio measurements associated with the
geographic location of the user's mobile device. Such a solution is still
costly in terms of battery consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore,
predicting the coverage on a location where no measurements are available
remains a key and challenging task. This paper describes a powerful tool that
gives an accurate coverage prediction on the whole area of interest: it builds
a coverage map by spatially interpolating geo-located measurements using the
Kriging technique. The paper focuses on the reduction of the computational
complexity of the Kriging algorithm by applying Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK). The
performance evaluation of the FRK algorithm both on simulated measurements and
real field measurements shows a good trade-off between prediction efficiency
and computational complexity. In order to go a step further towards the
operational application of the proposed algorithm, a multicellular use-case is
studied. Simulation results show a good performance in terms of coverage
prediction and detection of the best serving cell.

currents (TCs) and has been widely used ever since. However, its physical
justification was questioned because self-accelerating TCs simulated with the
steady TEM seemed to violate the turbulent kinetic energy balance. This
violation was considered as a result of very strong sediment erosion that
consumes more turbulent kinetic energy than is produced. To confine bed erosion
and thus remedy this issue, the four-equation model (FEM) was introduced by
assuming a proportionality between the bed shear stress and the turbulent
kinetic energy. Here we analytically proof that self-accelerating TCs simulated
with the original steady TEM actually never violate the turbulent kinetic
energy balance, provided that the bed drag coefficient is not unrealistically
low. We find that stronger bed erosion, surprisingly, leads to more production
of turbulent kinetic energy due to conversion of potential energy of eroded
material into kinetic energy of the current. Furthermore, we analytically show
that, for asymptotically supercritical flow conditions, the original steady TEM
always produces self-accelerating TCs if the upstream boundary conditions
(""ignition"" values) are chosen appropriately, while it never does so for
asymptotically subcritical flow conditions. We numerically show that our novel
method to obtain the ignition values even works for Richardson numbers very
near to unity. Our study also includes a comparison of the TEM and FEM closures
for the bed shear stress to simulation data of a coupled Large Eddy and
Discrete Element Model of sediment transport in water, which suggests that the
TEM closure might be more realistic than the FEM closure.

The belief is then transformed via a linear flow field which optimally updates

systems, investigations of whether habitable planets are likely to be

community. As current exoplanet statistics predicts that the chances are higher
to find new worlds in systems that are already known to have planets, we
examine four known extrasolar planetary systems in tight binaries in order to
determine their capacity to host additional habitable terrestrial planets.
Those systems are Gliese 86, gamma Cephei, HD 41004 and HD 196885. In the case
of gamma Cephei, our results suggest that only the M dwarf companion could host
additional potentially habitable worlds. Neither could we identify stable,
potentially habitable regions around HD 196885 A. HD 196885 B can be considered
a slightly more promising target in the search for Earth-twins. Gliese 86 A
turned out to be a very good candidate, assuming that the systems history has
not been excessively violent. For HD 41004, we have identified admissible
stable orbits for habitable planets, but those strongly depend on the
parameters of the system. A more detailed investigation shows that for some
initial conditions stable planetary motion is possible in the HZ of HD 41004 A.
In spite of the massive companion HD 41004 Bb, we found that HD 41004 B, too,
could host additional habitable worlds.

solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply

shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the
rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind
speed throughout the year ($-0.4 \lesssim \rho \lesssim -0.2$): there is a weak
tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in
Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east coast
of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter, primarily
associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clear-but-windy days.
We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind
turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months, daily variability in
total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity. The scenario
with the least seasonal variability is approximately 70%-solar to 30%-wind.
This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of
daily behaviour rather than relying on long-term average relationships or
correlations. In particular, the anticorrelation between wind and solar power
in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy
supply.

sources with a massless strut in between are studied. By means of the choice of
a suitable parametrization, the axis conditions and the absence of individual
magnetic charges are fulfilled; thus, the entire metric reduces to a
6-parametric asymptotically flat exact solution. Later on, with the purpose to
describe interacting black holes, the analytic functional form of the horizon
half-length parameter $\sigma_{k}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of physical
Komar parameters: mass $M_{k}$, electric charge $Q_{k}$, angular momentum
$J_{k}$, and coordinate distance $R$, where the seven physical parameters
satisfy a simple algebraic relation. Finally, in the limit of extreme black
holes, the full metric is derived in a closed analytical form, and a study on
the absence or appearance of naked singularities off the axis is presented.

waveform recorder I.C. (""SST"") with fast and flexible trigger capabilities is
presented. The SST's objective is to provide multi-GHz sample rates with
intrinsically-stable timing, Nyquist-rate sampling and high trigger bandwidth,
wide dynamic range and simple operation. Containing 4 channels of 256 samples
per channel, the SST is fabricated in an inexpensive 0.25 micrometer CMOS
process and uses a high-performance package that is 8 mm on a side. It has a
1.9V input range on a 2.5V supply, exceeds 12 bits of dynamic range, and uses
~128 mW while operating at 2 G-samples/s and full trigger rates. With a
standard 50 Ohm input source, the SST exceeds ~1.5 GHz -3 dB bandwidth. The
SST's internal sample clocks are generated synchronously via a shift register
driven by an external LVDS oscillator running at half the sample rate (e.g., a
1 GHz oscillator yields 2 G-samples/s). Because of its purely-digital
synchronous nature, the SST has ps-level timing uniformity that is independent
of sample frequencies spanning over 6 orders of magnitude: from under 2 kHz to
over 2 GHz. Only three active control lines are necessary for operation: Reset,
Start/Stop and Read-Clock. When operating as common-stop device, the time of
the stop, modulo 256 relative to the start, is read out along with the sampled
signal values. Each of the four channels integrates dual-threshold trigger
circuitry with windowed coincidence features. Channels can discriminate signals
with ~1mV RMS resolution at >600 MHz bandwidth.

nuclear matter quantities are calculated up to second order in many-body
perturbation theory. The spin-orbit term as well as two tensor terms contribute
at second order to the energy per particle. The simultaneous calculation of the
isotropic Fermi-liquid parameters provides a rigorous check through the
validity of the Landau relations. It is found that published results for these
second order contributions are incorrect in most cases. In particular,
interference terms between $s$-wave and $p$-wave components of the interaction
can contribute only to (isospin or spin) asymmetry energies. Even with nine
adjustable parameters, one does not obtain a good description of the empirical
nuclear matter saturation curve in the low density region $0<\rho<2\rho_0$. The
reason for this feature is the too strong density-dependence $\rho^{8/3}$ of
several second-order contributions. The inclusion of the density-dependent term
${1\over 6}t_3 \rho^{1/6}$ is therefore indispensable for a realistic
description of nuclear matter in the Skyrme framework.

scientific goals. Systematics affecting K2 light curves due to the decreased
spacecraft pointing precision inhibit the easy extraction of periodic signals
from the data. We here develop a method for producing periodograms of K2 light
curves that are insensitive to pointing-induced systematics; the
Systematics-Insensitive Periodogram (SIP). Traditional sine-fitting
periodograms use a generative model to find the frequency of a sinusoid that
best describes the data. We extend this principle by including systematic
trends, based on a set of 'Eigen light curves', following Foreman-Mackey et al.
(2015), in our generative model as well as a sum of sine and cosine functions
over a grid of frequencies. Using this method we are able to produce
periodograms with vastly reduced systematic features. The quality of the
resulting periodograms are such that we can recover acoustic oscillations in
giant stars and measure stellar rotation periods without the need for any
detrending. The algorithm is also applicable to the detection of other periodic
phenomena such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries and short-period exoplanet
candidates. The SIP code is available at https://github.com/RuthAngus/SIPK2.

the 21-cm brightness-temperature one-point statistics (as predicted by

four orders of magnitude and the hardness of the X-ray spectrum is varied from
that predicted for high-mass X-ray binaries, to the softer spectrum expected
from the hot inter-stellar medium. We find peaks in the redshift evolution of
both the variance and skewness associated with the efficiency of X-ray
production. The amplitude of the variance is also sensitive to the hardness of
the X-ray SED. We find that the relative timing of the coupling and heating
phases can be inferred from the redshift extent of a plateau that connects a
peak in the variance's evolution associated with Lyman-alpha coupling to the
heating peak. Importantly, we find that late X-ray heating would seriously
hamper our ability to constrain reionization with the variance. Late X-ray
heating also qualitatively alters the evolution of the skewness, providing a
clean way to constrain such models. If foregrounds can be removed, we find that
LOFAR, MWA and PAPER could constrain reionization and late X-ray heating models
with the variance. We find that HERA and SKA (phase 1) will be able to
constrain both reionization and heating by measuring the variance using
foreground-avoidance techniques. If foregrounds can be removed they will also
be able to constrain the nature of Lyman-alpha coupling.

presence of a galactic bar, gas in a disc in the central regions of a galaxy
will be driven inwards by angular momentum transport induced by acoustic
instabilities within the bar's inner Lindblad resonance. This transport process
drives turbulence within the gas that temporarily keeps it strongly
gravitationally stable and prevents the onset of rapid star formation. However,
at some point the rotation curve must transition from approximately flat to
approximately solid body, and the resulting reduction in shear reduces the
transport rates and causes gas to build up, eventually producing a
gravitationally-unstable region that is subject to rapid and violent star
formation. For the observed rotation curve of the Milky Way, the accumulation
happens $\sim 100$ pc from the centre of the Galaxy, in good agreement with the
observed location of gas clouds and young star clusters in the CMZ. The
characteristic timescale for gas accumulation and star formation is of order
$10-20$ Myr. We argue that similar phenomena should be ubiquitous in other

array antenna elements which maximize collecting area at the cost of

measurement system using the 137 MHz ORBCOMM satellite constellation and a
reference dipole antenna. Using power ratio measurements, we measure the {\it

antenna, canceling the variation of satellite flux or polarization with time.
We employ angular averaging to mitigate multipath effects (ground scattering),
and assess environmental systematics with a null experiment in which the MWA
tile is replaced with a second reference dipole. We achieve beam measurements
over 30 dB dynamic range in beam sensitivity over a large field of view (65\%
of the visible sky), far wider and deeper than drift scans through astronomical
sources allow. We verify an analytic model of the MWA tile at this frequency
within a few percent statistical scatter within the full width at half maximum.
Towards the edges of the main lobe and in the sidelobes, we measure tens of
percent systematic deviations. We compare these errors with those expected from
known beamforming errors.

methods to extract the H$\alpha$ + [NII] flux from J-PLUS photometric data: a
combination of a broad-band and a narrow-band filter ($r'$ and $F660$), two
broad-band and a narrow-band one ($r'$, $i'$ and $F660$), and a SED-fitting
based method using 8 photometric points. To test these methodologies, we
simulated J-PLUS data from a sample of 7511 SDSS spectra with measured
H$\alpha$ flux. Based on the same sample, we derive two empirical relations to
correct the derived H$\alpha$+[NII] flux from dust extinction and [NII]
contamination. We find that the only unbiased method is the SED fitting based
one. The combination of two filters underestimates the measurements of the
H$\alpha$ + [NII] flux by a 28%, while the three filters method by a 9%. We
study the error budget of the SED-fitting based method and find that, in
addition to the photometric error, our measurements have a systematic
uncertainty of a 4.3%. Several sources contribute to this uncertainty:
differences between our measurement procedure and the one used to derive the
spectroscopic values, the use of simple stellar populations as templates, and
the intrinsic errors of the spectra, which were not taken into account. Apart
from that, the empirical corrections for dust extinction and [NII]
contamination add an extra uncertainty of 14%. Given the J-PLUS photometric
system, the best methodology to extract H$\alpha$ + [NII] flux is the
SED-fitting based one. Using this method, we are able to recover reliable
H$\alpha$ fluxes for thousands of nearby galaxies in a robust and homogeneous
way.

the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud with multi-epoch
spectroscopy from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS). We use a
cross-correlation method to estimate relative radial velocities from the helium
and metal absorption lines for each of our targets. Objects with significant
radial-velocity variations (and with an amplitude larger than 16 km/s) are
classified as spectroscopic binaries. We find an observed spectroscopic binary
fraction (defined by periods of <10^3.5 d and mass ratios >0.1) for the B-type
stars, f_B(obs) = 0.25 +/- 0.02, which appears constant across the field of
view, except for the two older clusters (Hodge 301 and SL 639). These two
clusters have significantly lower fractions of 0.08 +/- 0.08 and 0.10 +/- 0.09,
respectively. Using synthetic populations and a model of our observed epochs
and their potential biases, we constrain the intrinsic multiplicity properties
of the dwarf and giant (i.e. relatively unevolved) B-type stars in 30 Dor. We
obtain a present-day binary fraction f_B(true) = 0.58 +/- 0.11, with a flat
period distribution. Within the uncertainties, the multiplicity properties of
the B-type stars agree with those for the O stars in 30 Dor from the VFTS.

entropies too high to cool, leading to carbon-enhancement in the re-collapsing
gas. This hydrodynamic selection effect could explain the observed incidence of
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars at low metallicity. We further explore
how anisotropic ejecta distributions, recently seen in direct numerical
simulations of core-collapse explosions, may translate to abundances in
metal-poor stars. We find that some of the observed scatter in the Population
II abundance ratios can be explained by an incomplete mixing of supernova
ejecta, even in the case of only one contributing enrichment event. We
demonstrate that the customary hypothesis of fully-mixed ejecta clearly fails
if post-explosion hydrodynamics prefers the recycling of some nucleosynthetic
products over others. Furthermore, to fully exploit the stellar-archaeological
program of constraining the Pop III initial mass function from the observed Pop

in the mass range 0.15 $< M/M_{\odot}<$ 1.0, using deep photometry collected

Observations at several epochs, spread over 9 years, allowed us to separate the
disk and bulge stars down to very faint magnitudes, F814W $\sim$ 26 mag, with a
proper-motion accuracy better than 0.5 mas/yr. This allowed us to determine the
initial mass function of the pure bulge component uncontaminated by disk stars
for this low-reddening field in the Sagittarius window. In deriving the mass
function, we took into account the presence of unresolved binaries, errors in
photometry, distance modulus and reddening, as well as the metallicity
dispersion and the uncertainties caused by adopting different theoretical
color-temperature relations. We found that the Galactic bulge initial mass
function can be fitted with two power laws with a break at M $\sim$ 0.56
$M_{\odot}$, the slope being steeper ($\alpha$ = -2.41$\pm$0.50) for the higher
masses, and shallower ($\alpha$ = -1.25$\pm$0.20) for the lower masses. In the
high-mass range, our derived mass function agrees well with the mass function
derived for other regions of the bulge. In the low-mass range however, our mass
function is slightly shallower, which suggests that separating the disk and
bulge components is particularly important in the low-mass range. The slope of
the bulge mass function is also similar to the slope of the mass function
derived for the disk in the high-mass regime, but the bulge mass function is
slightly steeper in the low-mass regime. We used our new mass function to
derive stellar M/L values for the Galactic bulge and we obtained 2.1
$<M/L_{F814W}<$ 2.4 and 3.1 $< M/L_{F606W}<$ 3.6 according to different

stringent constraints from local gravity experiments and, at the same time,
give rise to observable astrophysical and cosmological signatures. Such
screened modified gravity models necessarily have dynamics determined by
complex nonlinear equations that usually need to be solved on a model-by-model
basis to produce predictions. This makes testing them a cumbersome process. In
this paper, we investigate whether there is a common signature for all the
different models that is suitable to testing them on cluster scales. To do this
we propose an observable related to the fifth force, which can be
observationally related to the ratio of dynamical-to-lensing mass of a halo,
and then show that the predictions for this observable can be rescaled to a
near universal form for a large class of modified gravity models. We
demonstrate this using the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$, the Symmetron, the nDGP, and the
Dilaton models, as well as unifying parametrizations. The universal form is
determined by only three quantities: a strength, a mass, and a width parameter.
We also show how these parameters can be derived from a specific theory. This
self-similarity in the predictions can hopefully be used to search for
signatures of modified gravity on cluster scales in a model-independent way.

must also be in some highly quantum state. So that, within the interior region,
the mean-field approximation cannot be valid and the state of the BH cannot be
described by some semiclassical metric. On this basis, we model the state of
the BH interior as a collection of a large number of excitations that are
packed into closely spaced but single-occupancy energy levels; a sort-of ""Fermi
sea"" of all light-enough particles. This highly quantum state is surrounded by
a semiclassical region that lies close to the horizon and has a non-vanishing
energy density. It is shown that such a state looks like a BH from the outside
and decays via gravitational pair production in the near-horizon region at a
rate that agrees with the Hawking rate. We also consider the fate of a
classical object that has passed through to the BH interior and show that, once
it has crossed over the near-horizon threshold, the object meets its demise
extremely fast. This result cannot be attributed to a ""firewall"", as the trauma
to the in-falling object only begins after it has passed through the
near-horizon region and enters a region where semiclassical spacetime ends but
the energy density is still parametrically smaller than Planckian.

of membrane stiffness, rigidity and kinetics of the adhesive proteins, and the
fluid in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations complement these scaling
laws by quantifying the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins
domains on the size of the cell. Direct comparison with experiment shows that
passive elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein binding in the synaptic
cleft can describe the short-time formation and organization of protein
clusters, without evoking any active processes in the cytoskeleton. Despite the
apparent complexity of the process, our analysis highlights the role of just
two dimensionless parameters that characterize the spatial and temporal
evolution of the protein pattern: a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein
elasticity, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative

two coupled high quality factor silicon nitride microresonators, where the

flat bands, we consider a two-dimensional Bose gas at zero temperature with an
underlying quartic single-particle dispersion in one spatial direction. This
type of band structure can be realized using the NIST scheme of spin-orbit
coupling [Y.-J. Lin, K. Jim\'{e}nez-Garcia, and I. B. Spielman, Nature
$\textbf{471}$, 83 (2011)], in the regime where the lower band dispersion has
the form $\varepsilon_{\textbf{k}} \sim k_{x}^{4}/4+k_{y}^{2}+\ldots$, or using
the shaken lattice scheme of Parker $\textit{et al.}$ [C. V. Parker, L.-C. Ha
and C. Chin, Nature Physics $\textbf{9}$, 769 (2013)]. We numerically compare
the ground state energies of the mean-field Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and
various trial wave-functions, where bosons avoid each other at short distances.
We discover that, at low densities, several types of strongly correlated states
have an energy per particle ($\epsilon$), which scales with density ($n$) as
$\epsilon \sim n^{4/3}$, in contrast to $\epsilon \sim n$ for the weakly
interacting Bose gas. These competing states include a Wigner crystal,
quasi-condensates described in terms properly symmetrized fermionic states, and
variational wave-functions of Jastrow type. We find that one of the latter has
the lowest energy among the states we consider. This Jastrow-type state has a
strongly reduced, but finite condensate fraction, and true off-diagonal long
range order, which suggests that the ground state of interacting bosons with
quartic dispersion is a strongly-correlated condensate reminiscent of
superfluid Helium-4. Our results show that even for weakly-interacting bosons
in higher dimensions, one can explore the crossover from a weakly-coupled BEC
to a strongly-correlated condensate by simply tuning the single particle
dispersion or density.

The elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 is known to be surrounded by a number

that a new shell lies in this region.
  Aims. We obtain the deepest image ever of the galaxy, map the tidal features
in it, and search for the predicted shell.
  Methods. The image of the galaxy was taken by the MegaCam camera at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in the g' band. It reached the
surface-brightness limit of 29 mag/arcsec2. In addition, we reanalyzed an
archival HST image of the galaxy.
  Results. We detected up to 42 shells in NGC 3923. This is by far the highest
number among all shell galaxies. We present the description of the shells and
other tidal features in the galaxy. A probable progenitor of some of these
features was discovered. The shell system likely originates from two or more
progenitors. The predicted shell was not detected, but the new image revealed
that the prediction was based on incorrect assumptions and poor data.

in the presence of massive neutrinos, employing a set of large-volume,
high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations, where neutrinos are treated as
a separate collisionless fluid. The volume of 8$\cGpc$, combined with a
resolution of about $8\times 10^{10}\Ms$ for the cold dark matter (CDM)
component, represents a significant improvement over previous N-body
simulations in massive neutrino cosmologies. We show that most of the nonlinear
evolution is generated exclusively by the CDM component. We find that
accounting only for the nonlinear evolution of the CDM power spectrum allows to
recover the total matter power spectrum with the same accuracy as the massless
case. Indeed, we show that, the most recent version of the \halofit\ formula
calibrated on $\Lambda$CDM simulations can be applied directly to the linear
CDM power spectrum without requiring additional fitting parameters in the
massive case. As a second step, we study the abundance and clustering
properties of CDM halos, confirming that, in massive neutrino cosmologies, the
proper definition of the halo bias should be made with respect to the {\em
cold} rather than the {\em total} matter distribution, as recently shown in the
literature. Here we extend these results to the redshift space, finding that,
when accounting for massive neutrinos, an improper definition of the linear
bias can lead to a systematic error of about 1-$2 \%$ in the determination of
the linear growth rate from anisotropic clustering. This result is quite
important if we consider that future spectroscopic galaxy surveys, as \eg\
Euclid, are expected to measure the linear growth-rate with statistical errors
less than about $3 \%$ at $z\lesssim1$.

matter is consistent with observations. The common existence of bars in these
simulations is particularly noteworthy. This may have consequences when trying
to obtain information about the dark matter distribution in a galaxy, the mere
presence of spiral arms or a bar usually indicates that baryonic matter
dominates the central region and therefore observations, like rotation curves,

show that spiral arms and bars can develop in DM dominated galaxies with a

those with the smallest velocity dispersions belong to red, face-on galaxies

outflows along the minor axis for star-forming galaxies and accreting and/or

dimensionless, deterministic, asynchronous, anonymous, oblivious and autonomous
mobile robots with limited visibility moving in the Euclidean plane in
Look-Compute-Move (LCM) cycles. In this problem, the robots have to get close
enough to each other, so that every robot can see all the others, without
touching (i.e., colliding with) any other robot. The importance of solving the
Near-Gathering problem is that it makes it possible to overcome the restriction
of having robots with limited visibility. Hence it allows to exploit all the
studies (the majority, actually) done on this topic in the unlimited visibility
setting. Indeed, after the robots get close enough to each other, they are able
to see all the robots in the system, a scenario that is similar to the one
where the robots have unlimited visibility.
  We present the first (deterministic) algorithm for the Near-Gathering
problem, to the best of our knowledge, which allows a set of autonomous mobile
robots to nearly gather within finite time without ever colliding. Our
algorithm assumes some reasonable conditions on the input configuration (the
Near-Gathering problem is easily seen to be unsolvable in general). Further,
all the robots are assumed to have a compass (hence they agree on the ""North""
direction), but they do not necessarily have the same handedness (hence they
may disagree on the clockwise direction).
  We also show how the robots can detect termination, i.e., detect when the
Near-Gathering problem has been solved. This is crucial when the robots have to
perform a generic task after having nearly gathered. We show that termination
detection can be obtained even if the total number of robots is unknown to the
robots themselves (i.e., it is not a parameter of the algorithm), and robots
have no way to explicitly communicate.

Diffusiophoresis is a chemico-mechanical transduction mechanism in which a

a colloidal particle and drives it along the gradient. We consider a spherical
particle with an axisymmetric reacting cap covering the polar angle range $0\le
\theta\le \theta_{cap}$ in the presence of a repulsive solute, near an infinite
planar wall, and solve the coupled solute concentration and Stokes equations,
using a mixture of numerical and analytic arguments. The resulting particle
trajectory is determined by $\theta_{cap}$ and the initial orientation of the
symmetry axis with respect to the plane. At normal incidence the particle
initially moves away from or towards the wall, depending on whether the cap
faces towards or away, respectively, but even in the latter case the particle
never reaches the wall due to hydrodynamic lubrication resistance. For other
initial orientations, when $\theta_{cap}\le 115^{\circ}$ the particle either
moves away immediately or else rotates along its trajectory so as to cause the
active side to face the wall and the particle to rebound. For higher coverage
we find trajectories where the particle skims along the wall at constant
separation or else comes to rest. We provide a phase diagram giving the nature
of the trajectory (repulsion, rebound, skimming or stationary) as a function of
$\theta_{cap}$ and the initial orientation.

respect to the dopant substitutions, which modify the Mn-O-Mn bond angles and
lead to stronger the ferromagnetic component of the magnetic moment. Given the
fact that magnetic ordering in TbMnO3 causes the ferroelectricity, this is an
important step in the field of the magnetically driven ferroelectricity in the
class of magnetoelectric multiferroics, which traditionally have low magnetic
moments due to the predominantly antiferromagnetic order. In addition, the

to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the Seyfert 2 galaxy IC5063. A
fast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet, with the
highest outflow velocities about 0.5kpc from the nucleus, at the location of
the brighter hot-spot in the W lobe. The data show that a massive, fast outflow
with velocities up to 650 km/s of cold molecular gas is present, in addition to
one detected earlier in warm H2, HI and ionised gas. Both the central AGN and
the radio jet could energetically drive the outflow. However, the
characteristics of the outflowing gas point to the radio jet being the main
driver. This is important, because IC5063, although one of the most powerful
Seyfert galaxies, is a relatively weak radio source (P = 3x10^23 W/Hz). All the
observed characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jet
expanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and
inflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium.
This model is consistent with results obtained by recent simulations such as
those of Wagner et al.. A stronger, direct interaction between the jet and a
gas cloud is present at the location of the brighter W lobe. Even assuming the
most conservative values for the conversion factor CO-to-H2, the mass of the
outflowing gas is between 1.9 and 4.8x10^7 Msun. These amounts are much larger
than those of the outflow of warm gas (molecular and ionized) and somewhat
larger than of the HI outflow. This suggests that most of the observed cold
molecular outflow is due to fast cooling after being shocked. This gas is the
end product of the cooling process. Our CO observations demonstrate that fast
outflows of molecular gas can be driven by relativistic jets.

of these small-scale eruptions, in particular the kinetic energy and enthalpy.
Two Hinode XRT campaign datasets focusing on the two polar coronal holes were
selected to analyze the physical properties of coronal jets; the analyzed data
were acquired using a series of three XRT filters. Typical kinematical
properties (e.g., length, thickness, lifetime, ejection rate, and velocity) of
18 jets are evaluated from the observed sequences, thus providing information
on their possible contribution to the fast solar wind flux escaping from
coronal holes. Electron temperatures and densities of polar-jet plasmas are
also estimated using ratios of the intensities observed in different filters.
  We find that the largest amount of energy eventually provided to the corona
is thermal. The energy due to waves may also be significant, but its value is
comparatively uncertain. The kinetic energy is lower than thermal energy, while
other forms of energy are comparatively low. Lesser and fainter events seem to
be hotter, thus the total contribution by polar jets to the coronal heating
could have been underestimated so far. The kinetic energy flux is usually
around three times smaller than the enthalpy counterpart, implying that this
energy is converted into plasma heating more than in plasma acceleration. This
result suggests that the majority of polar jets are most likely not escaping
from the Sun and that only cooler ejections could possibly have enough kinetic
energy to contribute to the total solar wind flow.

cascades is highly nontrivial in several vital applications, such as viral
marketing, epidemic prevention and traffic management. Most previous works
mainly focus on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are typical
dynamic processes, it is always interesting and important to predict the
cascade size at any time, or predict the time when a cascade will reach a
certain size (e.g. an threshold for outbreak). In this paper, we unify all
these tasks into a fundamental problem: cascading process prediction. That is,
given the early stage of a cascade, how to predict its cumulative cascade size
of any later time? For such a challenging problem, how to understand the micro
mechanism that drives and generates the macro phenomenons (i.e. cascading
proceese) is essential. Here we introduce behavioral dynamics as the micro
mechanism to describe the dynamic process of a node's neighbors get infected by
a cascade after this node get infected (i.e. one-hop subcascades). Through
data-driven analysis, we find out the common principles and patterns lying in
behavioral dynamics and propose a novel Networked Weibull Regression model for
behavioral dynamics modeling. After that we propose a novel method for
predicting cascading processes by effectively aggregating behavioral dynamics,
and propose a scalable solution to approximate the cascading process with a

diffusivity is an exponential function D({\theta}) = D_o exp(\beta\theta). This
problem arises for example in the study of unsaturated flow in porous media
where {\theta} represents the liquid saturation. For physical parameters
corresponding to actual porous media, the diffusivity at the residual
saturation is D(0) = D_o << 1 so that the diffusion problem is nearly
degenerate. Such problems are characterised by wetting fronts that sharply
delineate regions of saturated and unsaturated flow, and that propagate with a
well-defined speed. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of large
{\beta}, we derive an analytical description of the solution that is uniformly
valid throughout the wetting front. This is in contrast with most other related
analyses that instead truncate the solution at some specific wetting front
location, which is then calculated as part of the solution, and beyond that
location the solution is undefined. Our asymptotic analysis demonstrates that
the solution has a four-layer structure, and by matching through the adjacent
layers we obtain an estimate of the wetting front location in terms of the
material parameters describing the porous medium. Using numerical simulations

back it is well known that to obtain the best possible estimates the tuning of
its statistics $X_0$, $P_0$, $\Theta$, $R$ and $Q$ namely initial state and
covariance, unknown parameters, and the measurement and state noise covariances
is very crucial. The earlier tweaking and other systematic approaches are
reviewed but none has reached a simple and easily implementable approach for
any application. The present reference recursive recipe based on multiple
filter passes through the data leads to a converged `statistical equilibrium'
solution. It utilizes the pre, post, and smoothed state estimates and their
corresponding measurements and the actual measurements as well as their
covariances to balance the state and measurement equations and form generalized
cost functions. The filter covariance at the end of each pass is heuristically
scaled up by the number of data points and further trimmed to provide the $P_0$
for subsequent passes. A simultaneous and proper choice for $Q$ and $R$ based
on the filter sample statistics and certain other covariances leads to a stable
filter operation providing the results after few iterations. When only $R$ is
present in the data by minimizing the `innovation' cost function using the non
filter based Newton Raphson optimization results served as an anchor for
matching and tuning the filter statistics. When both $R$ and $Q$ are present in
the data the consistency between the injected noise sequences and their
statistics provided a simple route and confidence in the present approach. A
typical simulation study of a spring, mass, damper system with a weak non
linear spring constant shows the present approach out performs earlier
techniques. The Part-2 of the paper further consolidates the present approach

novel self-healing ability for radiation damage, which has been demonstrated to
be especially linked to preferential occupation of interstitials at grain
boundary (GB) and promoted vacancy-interstitial annihilation. A major obstacle
to better understanding the healing property is the lack of an atomistic
picture of the interstitial states near GBs, due to severely separation of the
timescale of interstitial segregation from other events and abundance of
interstitials at the GB. Here, we report a generic ""self-blocking"" effect of
the interstitial cluster (SIAn) near the metallic GB in W, Mo and Fe. Upon
creating a SIAn near the GB, it is immediately trapped by the GB during the GB
structural relaxation and blocks there, impeding GB's further spontaneous
trapping of the SIAn in the vicinity and making these SIAns stuck nearby the
GB. The SIAn in the stuck state surprisingly owes an exceptionally larger
number of annihilation sites with vacancies near the GB than the SIAn trapped
at the GB due to maintaining its bulk configuration basically. Besides, it also
has an unexpectedly long-ranged repelling interaction with the SIA in the bulk
region, which may further affect the GB's trap of the SIAn. The self-blocking
effect might shed light on more critical and extended role of the GB in healing
radiation-damage in NCs than previously recognized the GB's limited role based
on GB's trap for the SIA and resulted vacancy-SIA recombination.

that $4nr-4r^2$ generic measurements are both necessary and sufficient for the
recovery of rank-$r$ matrices in $\C^{n\times n}$ by algebraic tools. Thus, we
confirm a conjecture which is raised by Eldar, Needell and Plan for the complex

tight provided $n=2^k+r, k\in \Z_+$. Motivated by Vinzant's work, we construct
$11$ matrices in $\R^{4\times 4}$ by computer random search and prove they
define injective measurements on rank-$1$ matrices in $\R^{4\times 4}$. This
disproves the conjecture raised by Eldar, Needell and Plan for the real case.
Finally, we use the results in this paper to investigate the phase retrieval by

downlink of cellular networks, at the price of channel state information (CSI)
feedback from the mobiles, sent over the uplink. Thus, it creates a mechanism
that can tradeoff some uplink capacity for increased downlink capacity. In this
work we quantify this tradeoff and study the exchange ratio between the
feedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We study both finite and
infinite networks, and show that for high enough (but finite) SNR, the uplink
rate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange
ratio. This exchange ratio is an increasing function of the channel coherence
time, and a decreasing function of the number of measured base stations. We
also show that devoting a constant fraction of the uplink to CSI feedback can
increase the downlink multiplexing gain continuously from 0 to 1, in finite
networks. On the other hand, in infinite networks (with infinite connectivity)
our bounds can only show doubly logarithmic scaling of the rate with SNR. The
presented results prove that the adaptation of the feedback rate can control
the balance between the uplink and downlink rates. This capability is very
important in modern cellular networks, where the operators need to respond to
continuously changing user demands.

to a more involved case of three sets of airplane data which have a larger
number of state, measurements, and unknown parameters. Further the flight tests
cannot always be conducted in an ideal situation of the process noise and the
measurement noises being white and Gaussian as is generally assumed in the
Kalman filter. The measurements are not available in general with respect to
the center of gravity, possess scale and bias factors which will have to be
modelled and estimated as well. The coupling between the longitudinal and
lateral motion brings in added difficulty but makes the problem more
interesting. At times the noisy measurements from the longitudinal and lateral
motion are input into the longitudinal states. This leads to the resulting
equations becoming linear with the measurement noise forming the process noise
input. At times it turns out that even a parameter that strongly affects the
airplane dynamics is estimated which vary widely among the approaches. This
requires a careful look at the estimates. We also recommend a closer look at
the correlation coefficients (that is generally ignored in such studies) of the
estimated parameters which provide an insight into their subsequent uses. The
present recipe has been shown to be better than the earlier approaches in
estimating the unknowns. In particular the generalized cost functions that are

distribution of equatorial rotational velocities in each region and calculated
the frequency distributions predicted by pulsation models, taking into account
rotational splitting of the frequencies. We confirm that rotation cannot

quantify the characteristics of \en related oceanic waves, based on sea surface
height satellite data. We associate the majority of dominant long distance
($\geq 500$ km) links of the network with (i) equatorial Kelvin waves, (ii)
off-equatorial Rossby waves, and (iii) tropical instability waves. Notably, we
find that the location of the hubs of out-going ($\sim 180^{\circ}\rm{E}$) and
in-coming ($\sim 140^{\circ}\rm{W}$) links of the climate network coincide with
the locations of the Kelvin wave initiation and dissipation, respectively. We
also find that this dissipation at $\sim 140^{\circ}\rm{W}$ is much weaker
during \en times. Moreover, the hubs of the off-equatorial network coincide
with the locations of westerly wind burst activity and high wind vorticity, two
mechanisms that were associated with Rossby waves activity. The quantitative
methodology and measures developed here can improve the understanding of \en

subtraction of resolved sources can push the limits of current observations and
infer the level of galaxy and black hole activity in the early universe.
However, disentangling the relative contribution from low- and high-redshift
sources is not trivial. Spatial fluctuations of the CIB exhibit a clustering
excess at angular scales $\sim 1^\circ$ whose origin has not been conclusively
identified. We explore the likelihood that this signal is dominated by emission
from galaxies and accreting black holes in the early Universe. We find that, if
the first small mass galaxies have a normal IMF, the light of their ageing
stars (fossils) integrated over cosmic time contributes a comparable amount to
the CIB as their pre-reionization progenitors. However, the measured
fluctuation signal is too large to be produced by galaxies at redshifts $z>8$
unless their star formation efficiencies are much larger than those inferred
from the observed Lyman-dropout population. In order to produce the observed
level of CIB fluctuation without violating constraints from galaxy counts and
the electron optical depth of the IGM, minihalos at $z>12$ must form stars with
efficiency $f_\star \gtrsim 0.1$ and, although a top-heavy IMF is preferred,
have a very low escape fraction of ionizing radiation, $f_{\rm esc}<0.01$. If
instead the CIB fluctuations are produced by high-$z$ black holes, one requires
vigorous accretion in the early universe reaching $\rho_{\rm acc} \gtrsim
10^5M_\odot{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ by $z\simeq 10$. This growth must stop by $z \sim 6$
and be significantly obscured not to overproduce the soft cosmic X-ray
background (CXB) and its observed coherence with the CIB. We therefore find the
range of suitable possibilities at high-$z$ to be narrow, but could possibly be
widened by including additional physics and evolution at those epochs.

introducing carriers into topological insulators, nevertheless, those
exhibiting indisputable superconductivity free from inhomogeneity are very few.
Here we report on the observation of topologically-protected surface states in
a centrosymmetric layered superconductor, beta-PdBi2, by utilizing spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Besides the bulk bands, several
surface bands, some of which crossing the Fermi level, are clearly observed
with symmetrically allowed in-plane spin-polarizations. These surface states
are precisely evaluated to be topological, based on the Z2 invariant analysis
in analogy to 3-dimensional strong topological insulators. beta-PdBi2 may offer
a TSC realized without any carrier-doping or applying pressure, i.e. a solid
stage to investigate the topological aspect in the superconducting condensate.

on an interpretive study aimed at broadening our understanding of the
psychology of programming in terms of the experience of affects while
programming, and the impact of affects on programming performance. We conducted
a qualitative interpretive study based on: face-to-face open-ended interviews,
in-field observations, and e-mail exchanges. This enabled us to construct a
novel explanatory theory of the impact of affects on development performance.
The theory is explicated using an established taxonomy framework. The proposed
theory builds upon the concepts of events, affects, attractors, focus, goals,

observed variety of pulsar spectra can be naturally explained by the thermal
free-free absorption that takes place in the surroundings of the pulsars. In
this context, the variety of the pulsar spectra can be explained according to
the shape, density and temperature of the absorbing media and the optical path
of the line-of-sight across that. We have put specific emphasis on the case of
the radio magnetar SGR J1745-2900 (also known as Sgr A* magnetar), modeling the
rapid variations of the pulsar spectrum after the outburst of Apr 2013 as due
to the free-free absorption of the radio emission in the electron material
ejected during the magnetar outburst. The ejecta expands with time and
consequently the absorption rate decreases and the shape of the spectrum
changes in such a way that the peak frequency shifts towards the lower radio
frequencies. In the hypothesis of an absorbing medium, we also discuss the
similarity between the spectral behaviour of the binary pulsar B1259-63 and the
spectral peculiarities of isolated pulsars.

galaxies, a strong correlation between these two quantities is expected. If the
gas causing star formation is also responsible for feeding the central black
hole, then a positive correlation is expected. If powerful AGNs are responsible
for the star formation quenching, then a negative correlation is expected.
Observations so far have mainly found a mild correlation or no correlation at
all (i.e. a flat relation between star formation rate (SFR) and AGN
luminosity), raising questions about the whole paradigm of ""AGN feedback"". In
this paper, we report the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical model,
which has a very strong coupling between AGN activity and quenching of star
formation. The predicted SFR-AGN luminosity correlation appears negative in the
low AGN luminosity regime, where AGN feedback acts, but becomes strongly
positive in the regime of the brightest AGN. Our predictions reproduce
reasonably well recent observations by Rosario et al., yet there is some
discrepancy in the normalisation of the correlation at low luminosities and
high redshifts. Though this regime could be strongly influenced by
observational biases, we argue that the disagreement could be ascribed to the
fact that GALFORM neglects AGN variability effects. Interestingly, the galaxies
that dominate the regime where the observations imply a weak correlation are
massive early-type galaxies that are subject to AGN feedback. Nevertheless,
these galaxies retain high enough molecular hydrogen contents to maintain
relatively high star formation rates and strong infrared emission.

and a surface. The real contact area depending on the distance is calculated
using Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The jump to contact, which
is often observed in atomic force microscopy experiments, is used as an
indicator for the initial point of contact, which in turn is defined by atomic
relaxations and thus without the need of external parameters. Within our
approach the contact area is estimated by evaluating the zero flux surfaces
between the touching Bader-atoms, where the necessary electronic density cutoff
for the Bader-partitioning is calculated to depend on the initial point of
contact. Our proposed approach is therefore completely ab-initio and we are
able to define and calculate the real area of contact without imposing
restrictions or free parameters. As a prototype system we choose a tip made of
a ten atom tungsten pyramid above a moir\'{e} layer of graphene on an fcc
iridium (111) substrate. We find that the contact area depends exponentially on
the effective distance between the tip apex and the surface atom directly below
within the atomically relaxed nanosystem.

classical tests for the general theory of relativity. It could be successfully
checked even in laboratory experiments on the earth's surface. The standard
derivation of this effect is based on the distortion of the local structure of
spacetime induced by large masses. The resulting gravitational time-dilation
near these masses gives rise to a frequency change of any periodic process,
including electromagnetic oscillations as the wave propagates across the
gravitational field. This phenomenon can be tackled with classical
electrodynamics assuming a curved spacetime background and Maxwell's equations
in a generally covariant form. In the present paper, we show that in a
classical field-theoretical context the gravitational redshift can be
interpreted as the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium with
corresponding conductivity $\sigma=g/(\mu_0 c^3)$, where $g$ is the

with the highest density in the central region, and decreasing density with the

through a flux of stable particles generated in dark matter annihilations and
peaked in the direction of the Galactic Center. We present a search for an
excess flux of muon (anti-) neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the
Galactic Center using the cubic-kilometer-sized IceCube neutrino detector at
the South Pole. There, the Galactic Center is always seen above the horizon.
Thus, new and dedicated veto techniques against atmospheric muons are required
to make the southern hemisphere accessible for IceCube. We used 319.7 live-days
of data from IceCube operating in its 79-string configuration during 2010 and
2011. No neutrino excess was found and the final result is compatible with the
background. We present upper limits on the self-annihilation cross-section,
$\left<\sigma_\mathrm{A} v\right>$, for WIMP masses ranging from 30 GeV up to
10 TeV, assuming cuspy (NFW) and flat-cored (Burkert) dark matter halo

from high-resolution circular polarisation (Stokes $V$) observations. Due to
their generally complex morphologies, the stellar Stokes $V$ profiles are
usually interpreted with elaborate inversion techniques such as Zeeman Doppler
imaging (ZDI). Here we further develop a new method of interpretation of
circular polarisation signatures in spectral lines using cumulative Stokes $V$
profiles (anti-derivative of Stokes $V$). This method is complimentary to ZDI
and can be applied for validation of the inversion results or when the
available observational data are insufficient for an inversion. Based on the
rigorous treatment of polarised line formation in the weak-field regime, we
show that, for rapidly rotating stars, the cumulative Stokes $V$ profiles
contain information about the spatially resolved longitudinal magnetic field
density. Rotational modulation of these profiles can be employed for a simple,
qualitative characterisation of the stellar magnetic field topologies. We apply
this diagnostic method to the archival observations of the weak-line T Tauri
star V410 Tau and Bp He-strong star HD 37776. We show that the magnetic field
in V410 Tau is dominated by an azimuthal component, in agreement with the ZDI
map that we recover from the same data set. For HD 37776 the cumulative Stokes
$V$ profile variation indicates the presence of multiple regions of positive
and negative field polarity. This behaviour agrees with the ZDI results but
contradicts the popular hypothesis that the magnetic field of this star is
dominated by an axisymmetric quadrupolar component.

studies of Yang-Mills correlators in a broad class of covariant gauges
continuously connected to the well-studied Landau gauge. We compute the ghost

perturbation theory and we study their momentum dependence down to the deep

particular, we show that the theory admits infrared-safe renormalization-group
trajectories with no Landau pole. Both the gluon and the ghost behave as
massive fields at low energy, and the gluon propagator is transverse even away

precise photometric data. Among the stars observed, red giants show a rich
oscillation pattern that allows their precise characterization. Long-duration
observations allow for investigating the fine structure of this oscillation
pattern. A common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giant
stars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotic
theory. This pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern,
describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. We aim to investigate the
deviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them in
terms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium. We also show how
this seismic signature depends on stellar evolution. We measured the
frequencies of radial modes with a maximum likelihood estimator method, then we
identified a modulation corresponding to the departure from the universal
oscillation pattern. We identify the modulation component of the radial mode
frequency spacings in more than five hundred red giants. The variation in the
modulation that we observe at different evolutionary states brings new
constraints on the interior models for these stars. We also derive an updated
form of the universal pattern that accounts for the modulation and provides
highly precise radial frequencies.

sparsity-inducing penalty is used in the first stage to predict the support,
which is then conveyed to the second stage for estimation or inference
purposes. In this framework, the first stage screens variables to find a set of
possibly relevant variables and the second stage operates on this set of
candidate variables, to improve estimation accuracy or to assess the
uncertainty associated to the selection of variables. We advocate that more

magnitude of the coefficients estimated in the first stage to define an
adaptive penalty that is applied at the second stage. We give two examples of
procedures that can benefit from the proposed transfer of information, in
estimation and inference problems respectively. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that this transfer is particularly efficient when each stage
operates on distinct subsamples. This separation plays a crucial role for the
computation of calibrated p-values, allowing to control the False Discovery

A particularly fascinating phenomenon is the scaling relationship of

analyze how network topology and nodes with finite capacity lead to deviations
from a simple scaling law $\sigma \sim \langle f \rangle ^\alpha$. Sources of
randomness are the random walk itself (internal noise) and the fluctuation of
the number of walkers (external noise). We obtained exact results for the
extreme case of a star network which are indicative of the behavior of large
scale systems with a broad degree distribution.The latter are subsequently
studied using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the network heterogeneity
amplifies the effects of external noise. By computing the `effective' scaling
of each node we show that multiple scaling relationships can coexist in a graph
with a heterogeneous degree distribution at an intermediate level of external
noise. Finally, we analyze the effect of a finite capacity of nodes for random
walkers and find that this also can lead to a heterogeneous scaling of

Using HF to trace H2 in our sample, we find that the N(H2O)-to-N(HF) ratio

suggest that H2O might be used as a tracer of H2 -within a factor 2.5- in the

around the median is driven by true local variations in the H2O abundance
relative to H2 throughout the disk. The latter variability allows us to test
our theoretical understanding of the chemistry of oxygen-bearing molecules in
the diffuse gas. We show that both gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry are

forward evaluation of a fully learnt function to obtain smooth label
predictions, (ii) with increasing depth, a larger context is considered for
pixel labelling which improves accuracy, and (iii) it is easy to visualise the
effect of feature activation(s) in the pixel label space at any depth. SegNet
is composed of a stack of encoders followed by a corresponding decoder stack
which feeds into a soft-max classification layer. The decoders help map low
resolution feature maps at the output of the encoder stack to full input image
size feature maps. This addresses an important drawback of recent deep learning
approaches which have adopted networks designed for object categorization for
pixel wise labelling. These methods lack a mechanism to map deep layer feature
maps to input dimensions. They resort to ad hoc methods to upsample features,
e.g. by replication. This results in noisy predictions and also restricts the
number of pooling layers in order to avoid too much upsampling and thus reduces
spatial context. SegNet overcomes these problems by learning to map encoder
outputs to image pixel labels. We test the performance of SegNet on outdoor RGB
scenes from CamVid, KITTI and indoor scenes from the NYU dataset. Our results
show that SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance even without use of
additional cues such as depth, video frames or post-processing with CRF models.

is studied. We model the outer crust to be made of fully equilibrated matter
where ionized nuclei form a Coulomb crystal embedded in an electron gas. The
main effects of the strong magnetic field are those of quantizing the electron
motion in Landau levels and of modifying the nuclear single particle levels
producing, on average, an increased binding of nucleons in nuclei present in
the Coulomb lattice. The effect of an homogeneous and constant magnetic field
on nuclear masses has been predicted by using a covariant density functional,
in which induced currents and axial deformation due to the presence of a
magnetic field that breaks time-reversal symmetry have been included
self-consistently in the nucleon and meson equations of motion. Although not
yet observed, for $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$G both effects contribute to produce
different compositions and to enlarge the range of pressures typically present
in common neutron stars. Specifically, in such a regime, the magnetic field
effects on nuclei favor the appearance of heavier nuclei at low pressures. As
$B$ increases, such heavier nuclei are also preferred up to larger pressures.
In the most extreme case, the whole outer crust is almost made of
${}_{40}^{92}$Zr$_{52}$.

Pre- and post-eruption images were taken by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on
Hinode. Pre-eruption, a dome-like structure exists above the prominence, as
demarcated by coronal rain. As the eruption progresses, we find evidence for
reconnection between the prominence magnetic field and the overlying field.
Fast flows are seen in AIA and IRIS, indicating reconnection outflows.
Plane-of-sky flows of ~300 km s$^{-1}$ are observed in the AIA 171 A channel
along a potentially reconnected field line. IRIS detects intermittent fast
line-of-sight flows of ~200 km s$^{-1}$ coincident with the AIA flows.
Differential emission measure calculations show heating at the origin of the
fast flows. Post-eruption XRT images show hot loops probably due to
reconfiguration of magnetic fields during the eruption and subsequent heating
of plasma in these loops. Although there is evidence for reconnection above the
prominence during the eruption, high spatial resolution images from IRIS reveal
potential reconnection sites below the prominence. A height-time analysis of
the erupting prominence shows a slow initial rise with a velocity of ~0.4 km
s$^{-1}$ followed by a rapid acceleration with a final velocity of ~250 km
s$^{-1}$. Brightenings in IRIS during the transition between these two phases
indicate the eruption trigger for the fast part of the eruption is likely a

the scalar field but it is of the order of $40\%$ for the scalar dissipation
rate. An examination of the filtering operation using modeled spectra and the
measured spatial resolution shows that the Wiener filter produces errors in the
estimate of the scalar dissipation rate $\sim30\%$, for Taylor-scale Reynolds

improving the spatial resolution as compared to improvements in the signal to

cells (RBCs) in different DLD devices. We quantify the DLD efficiency in terms
of appropriate ""failure"" probabilities and RBC counts in designated device
outlets. Our main result is that the displacement mode breaks down upon an
increase of RBC volume fraction, while the zigzag mode remains relatively
robust. This suggests that the separation of larger particles (such as white
blood cells) from a dense RBC background is simpler than separating smaller
particles (such as platelets) from the same background. The observed breakdown
stems from non-deterministic particle collisions interfering with the designed
deterministic nature of DLD devices. Therefore, we postulate that dense

been understood well. It is still uncertain why and which massive stars enter
this phase. Investigating the variabilities by looking for a possible regular
or even (semi-)periodic behaviour could give a hint at the underlying mechanism
for these variations and might answer the question of where these variabilities
originate. Finding out more about the LBV phase also means understanding
massive stars better in general, which have (e.g. by enriching the ISM with
heavy elements, providing ionising radiation and kinetic energy) a strong and
significant influence on the ISM, hence also on their host galaxy. Photometric
and spectroscopic data were taken for the LBV Var C in M33 to investigate its
recent status. In addition, scanned historic plates, archival data, and data
from the literature were gathered to trace Var C's behaviour in the past. Its
long-term variability and periodicity was investigated. Our investigation of
the variability indicates possible (semi-)periodic behaviour with a period of
42.3 years for Var C. That Var C's light curve covers a time span of more than
100 years means that more than two full periods of the cycle are visible. The
critical historic maximum around 1905 is less strong but discernible even with
the currently rare historic data. The semi-periodic and secular structure of
the light curve is similar to the one of LMC R71. Both light curves hint at a
new aspect in the evolution of LBVs.

the force decays as the inverse $(D+1)$th power of the distance.

node coreness in a spreading process is largely impacted due to the existence
of core-like group, which has a large k-shell index but a low spreading
efficiency. Based on analysis of the structure of core-like groups in
real-world networks, we discover that nodes in the core-like group are mutually
densely connected with very few out-leaving links from the group. By defining a
measure of diffusion importance for each edge based on the number of
out-leaving links of its both ends, we are able to identify redundant links in
the spreading process, which have a relatively low diffusion importance but
lead to form the locally densely connected core-like group. After filtering out
the redundant links and applying the k-shell method to the residual network, we
obtain a renewed coreness for each node which is a more accurate index to
indicate its location importance and spreading influence in the original
network. Moreover, we find that the performance of the ranking algorithms based
on the renewed coreness are also greatly enhanced. Our findings help to more
accurately decompose the network core structure and identify influential nodes
in spreading processes.

to strongly impact the radial velocity time series. It then limits the
detection of small planetary RV signals (eg, an Earth-mass planet in the
habitable zone of a solar-like star). In previous papers, we studied the
detectability of such planets around the Sun seen as an edge-on star. For that
purpose, we computed the RV and photometric variations induced by solar
magnetic activity, using all active structures observed over one entire cycle.
Our goal is to perform similar studies on stars with different physical and
geometrical properties. As a first step, we focus on Sun-like stars seen with
various inclinations, and on estimating detection capabilities with forthcoming
instruments. To do so, we first parameterize the solar active structures with
the most realistic pattern so as to obtain results consistent with the observed
ones. We simulate the growth, evolution and decay of solar spots, faculae and
network, using parameters and empiric laws derived from solar observations and
literature. We generate the corresponding structure lists over a full solar
cycle. We then build the resulting spectra and deduce the RV and photometric
variations for a `Sun' seen with various inclinations. The produced RV signal
takes into account the photometric contribution of structures as well as the
attenuation of the convective blueshift. The comparison between our simulated
activity pattern and the observed one validates our model. We show that the
inclination of the stellar rotation axis has a significant impact on the time
series. RV long-term amplitudes as well as short-term jitters are significantly
reduced when going from edge-on to pole-on configurations. Assuming spin-orbit
alignment, the optimal configuration for planet detection is an inclined star
(i~45{\deg}).

acting on a heavy quark moving through strongly interacting plasma. The new
contributions are chiral in that they act in opposite directions in plasmas
containing an excess of left- or right-handed quarks and in that they are
proportional to the coefficient of the axial anomaly. These new contributions
to the drag force act either parallel to or antiparallel to an external
magnetic field or to the vorticity of the fluid plasma. In all these respects,
these contributions to the drag force felt by a heavy quark are analogous to
the chiral magnetic effect on light quarks. However, the new contribution to
the drag force is independent of the electric charge of the heavy quark and is
the same for heavy quarks and antiquarks. We show that although the chiral drag
force can be non-vanishing for heavy quarks that are at rest in the local fluid
rest frame, it does vanish for heavy quarks that are at rest in a suitably
chosen frame. In this frame, the heavy quark at rest sees counterpropagating
momentum and charge currents, both proportional to the axial anomaly
coefficient, but feels no drag force. This provides strong concrete evidence
for the absence of dissipation in chiral transport, something that has been
predicted previously via consideration of symmetries. Along the way to our
principal results, we provide a general calculation of the corrections to the
drag force due to the presence of gradients in the flowing fluid in the
presence of a nonzero chemical potential. We close with a consequence of our
result that is at least in principle observable in heavy ion collisions, namely
an anticorrelation between the direction of the CME current for light quarks in
a given event and the direction of the kick given to the momentum of all the

its physics reach substantially. Its charge identification capability, and
hence its ability to distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos, makes it an
efficient detector for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy. In this report,
we outline the analyses carried out for the determination of neutrino mass
hierarchy and precision measurements of atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters

must be made with an incomplete information set. Belief function theories
(e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been
shown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the
quantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete
information set. For decision making, the pignistic (from the Latin pignus, a
bet) probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs
or basic belief assignments (BBAs) to make decisions. For many systems, one
need only address the most-probable elements in the set. For some critical
systems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe
probability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to
decision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above
the risk decision threshold. The problem is greatly simplified if most of the
probabilities fall below this threshold. Finding a probability transform that
properly represents mixes of low- and high-probability events is essential.
This article introduces four new pignistic probability transforms with an
implementation that uses the latest values of Beliefs, Plausibilities, or BBAs
to improve the pignistic probability estimates. Some of them assign smaller
values of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets
pignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger
values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability
transforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the
values below the risk threshold. A probability information content (PIC)
variable is also introduced that assigns an information content value to any
set of probability. Four operators are defined to help simplify the
derivations.

representations of finite subgroups is discussed. A Mathematica package is
presented that can be used to compute these branching rules using the Weyl
character formula. For some low order finite groups including $A_4$ and
$\Delta(27)$ general analytical formulas are presented for the branching rules
of arbitrary representations of their smallest Lie super-groups.

Hijazi, Pascal Van Hentenryck","DistFlow Extensions for AC Transmission Systems",,,,"LA-UR-17-25214","math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convex relaxations of the power flow equations and, in particular, the
Semi-Definite Programming (SDP), Second-Order Cone (SOC), and Convex DistFlow
(CDF) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent years. Thus
far, studies of the CDF model and its connection to the other relaxations have
been limited to power distribution systems, which omit several parameters
necessary for modeling transmission systems. To increase the applicability of
the CDF relaxation, this paper develops an extended CDF model that is suitable
for transmission systems by incorporating bus shunts, line charging, and
transformers. Additionally, a theoretical result shows that the established
equivalence of the SOC and CDF models for distribution systems also holds in
this transmission system extension.

and kinetic decomposition of melon seed husks (MSH) under inert (pyrolysis)
conditions. The calorific value, elemental composition, proximate analyses and
thermal kinetics of MSH was examined. The kinetic parameters; activation energy
E and frequency factor A for MSH decomposition under pyrolysis conditions were
determined using the Kissinger and isoconversional Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO)
methods. The values of E for MSH ranged from 146.81 to 296 kJ/mol at degrees of
conversion {\alpha} = 0.15 to 0.60 for FWO. The decomposition of MSH process
was fastest at {\alpha} = 0.15 and slowest at {\alpha} = 0.60 with average E
and A values of 192.96 kJ/mol and 2.86 x 1026 min-1, respectively at
correlation values of 0.9847. The kinetic values of MSH using the Kissinger
method are E = 161.26 kJ/mol and frequency factor, A = 2.08 x 1010 min-1 with
the correlation value, R2 = 0.9958. The results indicate that MSH possesses
important characteristics of a potential solid biofuel (SBF) for future
thermochemical applications in clean energy and power generation.

point sources of waves modulated by correlated signals and by measuring only
intensities at one single receiver. For appropriately chosen source pairs, we
show that full waveform array measurements can be recovered from such intensity
measurements by solving a linear least squares problem. The least squares
solution can be used to image with Kirchhoff migration, even if the solution is
determined only up to a known one-dimensional nullspace. The same imaging
strategy can be used when the medium is probed with point sources driven by
correlated Gaussian processes and autocorrelations are measured at a single
location. Since autocorrelations are robust to noise, this can be used for
imaging when the probing wave is drowned in background noise.

of homogeneous goods in polypoly markets. This new approach is based on the
idea that the price dispersion has its origin in the dynamics of the purchase
process. The price dispersion is determined by the chance that demanded and
supplied product units meet in a given price interval. It can be characterized
by a fat-tailed Laplace distribution for short and by a lognormal distribution
for long time horizons. Taking random temporal variations of demanded and
supplied units into account both the mean price and also the standard deviation
of the price dispersion are governed by a lognormal distribution. A comparison
with empirical investigations confirms the model statements.
