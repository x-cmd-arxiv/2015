manner that facilitates multi-access without collision. The setting is of a
noisy, synchronous, Boolean, multi-access channel where $K$ active users (out
of a total of $N$ users) seek to access. A solution to the partition problem
places each of the $N$ users in one of $K$ groups (or blocks) such that no two
active nodes are in the same block. We consider a simple, but non-trivial and
illustrative case of $K=2$ active users and study the number of steps $T$ used
to solve the partition problem. By random coding and a suboptimal decoding
scheme, we show that for any $T\geq (C_1 +\xi_1)\log N$, where $C_1$ and
$\xi_1$ are positive constants (independent of $N$), and $\xi_1$ can be
arbitrary small, the partition problem can be solved with error probability
$P_e^{(N)} \to 0$, for large $N$. Under the same scheme, we also bound $T$ from
the other direction, establishing that, for any $T \leq (C_2 - \xi_2) \log N$,
the error probability $P_e^{(N)} \to 1$ for large $N$; again $C_2$ and $\xi_2$
are constants and $\xi_2$ can be arbitrarily small. These bounds on the number
of steps are lower than the tight achievable lower-bound in terms of $T \geq
(C_g +\xi)\log N $ for group testing (in which all active users are identified,
rather than just partitioned). Thus, partitioning may prove to be a more
efficient approach for multi-access than group testing.

solutions to the transformed equation do not develop shocks. This permits us to
extend the dKP solution as the graph of a multivalued function beyond the
critical time when the gradients blow up. This overturned solution is
multivalued in a lip shape region in the $(x,y)$ plane, where the solution of
the dKP equation exists in a weak sense only, and a shock front develops. A
local expansion reveals the universal scaling structure of the shock, which
after a suitable change of coordinates corresponds to a generic cusp
catastrophe. We provide a heuristic derivation of the shock front position near
the critical point for the solution of the dKP equation, and study the solution
of the dKP equation when a small amount of dissipation is added. Using
multiple-scale analysis, we show that in the limit of small dissipation and
near the critical point of the dKP solution, the solution of the dissipative
dKP equation converges to a Pearcey integral. We test and illustrate our
results by detailed comparisons with numerical simulations of both the

is, however, heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary
threshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations, applied to
small or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets. Here we present a systematic,
large-scale, and multidisciplinary analysis of the SB phenomenon in science. We
introduce a parameter-free measure that quantifies the extent to which a
specific paper can be considered an SB. We apply our method to 22 million
scientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences
over a time span longer than a century. Our results reveal that the SB
phenomenon is not exceptional. There is a continuous spectrum of delayed
recognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are
taken into account. Although many cases of SBs can be identified by looking at
monodisciplinary bibliographic data, the SB phenomenon becomes much more
apparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets, where we can observe
many examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in
disciplines different from those where they were originally published. Our
analysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has
received little attention, and also provides empirical evidence against the use
of short-term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact.

the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and determine its physical characteristics
based on its X-ray emission. Methods. We observed SNR J0533-7202 with
XMM-Newton (flare-filtered exposure times of 18 ks EPIC-pn and 31 ks
EPIC-MOS1/MOS2). We produced X-ray images of the SNR, performed an X-ray
spectral analysis, and compared the results to multi-wavelength studies.
Results. The distribution of X-ray emission is highly non-uniform, with the
south-west region brighter than the north-east. The X-ray emission is
correlated with the radio emission from the remnant. We determine that this
morphology is likely due to the SNR expanding into a non-uniform ambient medium
and not an absorption effect. We estimate the size to be 53.9 (\pm 3.4) x 43.6
(\pm 3.4) pc, with the major axis rotated ~64 degrees east of north. We find no
spectral signatures of ejecta and infer that the X-ray plasma is dominated by
swept-up interstellar medium. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedov
self-similar solution, we estimate an age of ~17-27 kyr, with an initial
explosion energy of (0.09-0.83) x 10^51 erg. We detected an X-ray source
located near the centre of the remnant, namely XMMU J053348.2-720233. The
source type could not be conclusively determined due to the lack of a
multi-wavelength counterpart and low X-ray counts. We find that it is likely
either a background active galactic nucleus or a low-mass X-ray binary in the
LMC. Conclusions. We detected bright thermal X-ray emission from SNR J0533-7202
and determined that the remnant is in the Sedov phase of its evolution. The
lack of ejecta emission prohibits us from typing the remnant with the X-ray
data. Therefore, the likely Type Ia classification based on the local stellar
population and star formation history reported in the literature cannot be
improved upon.

One concerns the selection of a correct parameter to build an appropriate
complex on top of the data points; the other involves with the typical `large'
size of this complex. We address these two issues in the context of inferring
homology from sample points of a smooth manifold of known dimension sitting in
an Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$. We show that, for a sample size of $n$
points, we can identify a set of $O(n^2)$ points (as opposed to $O(n^{\lceil
\frac{k}{2}\rceil})$ Voronoi vertices) approximating a subset of the medial
axis that suffices to compute a distance sandwiched between the well known
local feature size and the local weak feature size (in fact, the approximating
set can be further reduced in size to $O(n)$). This distance, called the lean
feature size, helps pruning the input set at least to the level of local
feature size while making the data locally uniform. The local uniformity in
turn helps in building a complex for homology inference on top of the
sparsified data without requiring any user-supplied distance threshold. Unlike
most topology inference results, ours does not require that the input is dense
relative to a {\em global} feature such as {\em reach} or {\em weak feature
size}; instead it can be adaptive with respect to the local feature size. We
present some empirical evidence in support of our theoretical claims.

Odagiri proved that a similar property holds over the tropical semiring if one
replaces subtraction with addition. The tropical semiring belongs to a large
family of algebraic structures called commutative idempotent semiring. In this
paper, we prove that the same property (with subtraction replaced with
addition) holds over an \emph{arbitrary\/} commutative idempotent semiring.

  Diverse Information Sources",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prediction polling is an increasingly popular form of crowdsourcing in which
multiple participants estimate the probability or magnitude of some future
event. These estimates are then aggregated into a single forecast.
Historically, randomness in scientific estimation has been generally assumed to
arise from unmeasured factors which are viewed as measurement noise. However,
when combining subjective estimates, heterogeneity stemming from differences in
the participants' information is often more important than measurement noise.
This paper formalizes information diversity as an alternative source of such
heterogeneity and introduces a novel modeling framework that is particularly
well-suited for prediction polls. A practical specification of this framework
is proposed and applied to the task of aggregating probability and point
estimates from two real-world prediction polls. In both cases our model
outperforms standard measurement-error-based aggregators, hence providing
evidence in favor of information diversity being the more important source of
heterogeneity.

Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument for the 2x8.4 m Large Binocular

000 can cover the entire optical/red wavelength range from 383 to 907 nm in
three exposures. Two 10.3kx10.3k CCDs with 9-{\mu}m pixels and peak quantum
efficiencies of 96 % record a total of 92 echelle orders. We introduce a new
variant of a wave-guide image slicer with 3, 5, and 7 slices and peak
efficiencies between 96 %. A total of six cross dispersers cover the six
wavelength settings of the spectrograph, two of them always simultaneously.
These are made of a VPH-grating sandwiched by two prisms. The peak efficiency
of the system, including the telescope, is 15% at 650 nm, and still 11% and 10%
at 390 nm and 900 nm, respectively. In combination with the 110 m2
light-collecting capability of the LBT, we expect a limiting magnitude of 20th
mag in V in the low-resolution mode. The R=120 000 mode can also be used with
two, dual-beam Stokes IQUV polarimeters. The 270 000-mode is made possible with
the 7-slice image slicer and a 100- {\mu}m fibre through a projected sky
aperture of 0.74"", comparable to the median seeing of the LBT site. The
43000-mode with 12-pixel sampling per resolution element is our bad seeing or
faint-object mode. Any of the three resolution modes can either be used with
sky fibers for simultaneous sky exposures or with light from a stabilized
Fabry-Perot etalon for ultra-precise radial velocities. CCD-image processing is
performed with the dedicated data-reduction and analysis package PEPSI-S4S. A
solar feed makes use of PEPSI during day time and a 500-m feed from the 1.8 m
VATT can be used when the LBT is busy otherwise. In this paper, we present the
basic instrument design, its realization, and its characteristics.

measure gravitational lensing shear directly from observations of a single
background source. The technique assumes the velocity map of an un-lensed,
stably-rotating galaxy will be rotationally symmetric. Lensing distorts the
velocity map making it asymmetric. The degree of lensing can be inferred by
determining the transformation required to restore axisymmetry. This technique
is in contrast to traditional weak lensing methods, which require averaging an
ensemble of background galaxy ellipticity measurements, to obtain a single
shear measurement. We have tested the efficacy of our fitting algorithm with a
suite of systematic tests on simulated data. We demonstrate that we are in
principle able to measure shears as small as 0.01. In practice, we have fitted
for the shear in very low redshift (and hence un-lensed) velocity maps, and
have obtained null result with an error of $\pm 0.01$. This high sensitivity
results from analysing spatially resolved spectroscopic images (i.e. 3D data
cubes), including not just shape information (as in traditional weak lensing
measurements) but velocity information as well. Spirals and rotating
ellipticals are ideal targets for this new technique. Data from any large IFU
or radio telescope is suitable, or indeed any instrument with spatially
resolved spectroscopy such as SAMI, ALMA, HETDEX and SKA.

residential electricity demand. This elasticity can be employed to shape the
daily aggregated electricity demand profile of a system comprised of a large
number of residential PEVs' users sharing one electricity retailer or an
aggregator. In this paper, we propose a joint demand shaping and altering
algorithm for managing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled PEVs' electricity
assignments (charging and discharging) in order to diminish the overall
electricity procurement costs for a retailer bidding to two-settlement
electricity markets, i.e., a day-ahead (DA) and a real-time (RT) market. This
approach is decentralized, scalable, fast converging and does not violate
users' privacy. Our simulations' results demonstrate significant overall cost
savings (up to 28\%) for a retailer bidding to an operational electricity
market by using our proposed algorithm. This becomes even more salient when the
power system is integrating a large number of intermittent energy resources
wherein RT demand altering is crucial due to more likely contingencies and
hence more RT price fluctuations and even more so-called \textit{black swan
events}. Lower electricity procurement cost for a retailer finally makes it
able to offer better deals to customers and expand its market capacity. This
implies that customers can enjoy lower electricity bills as well.

sequence stellar and circumstellar evolution but are long recognized as
difficult to derive and calibrate. In this paper, we use literature spectral
types and photometry to construct empirical isochrones in HR diagrams for
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the eta Cha, epsilon Cha, and TW Hya
Associations and the beta Pic and Tuc-Hor Moving Groups. A successful theory of
pre-main sequence evolution should match the shapes of the stellar loci for
these groups of young stars. However, when comparing the combined empirical
isochrones to isochrones predicted from evolutionary models, discrepancies lead
to a spectral type (mass) dependence in stellar age estimates. Improved
prescriptions for convection and boundary conditions in the latest models of
pre-main sequence models lead to a significantly improved correspondence
between empirical and model isochrones, with small offsets at low temperatures
that may be explained by observational uncertainties or by model limitations.
Independent of model predictions, linear fits to combined stellar loci of these
regions provide a simple empirical method to order clusters by luminosity with
a reduced dependence on spectral type. Age estimates calculated from various
sets of modern models that reproduce Li depletion boundary ages of the beta Pic
Moving Group also imply a ~4 Myr age for the low mass members of the Upper Sco
OB Association, which is younger than the 11 Myr age that has been recently
estimated for intermediate mass members.

this study we analyze the cyclic variation of inter-network horizontal field by
using the spectro-polarimeter observations provided by Solar Optical Telescope

method of wavelength integration is adopted to achieve a high signal-to-noise
ratio. It is found that from 2008 to 2015 the inter-network horizontal field
does not vary when solar activity increases, and the average flux density of
inter-network horizontal field is 87$\pm$1 G, In addition, the imbalance
between horizontal and vertical field also keeps invariant within the scope of
deviation, i.e., 8.7$\pm$0.5, from the solar minimum to maximum of solar cycle
24. This result confirms that the inter-network horizontal field is independent
of sunspot cycle. The revelation favors the idea that a local dynamo is

on the surface of a cylinder, the distance between the two ends with open

scales linearly as increasing the system size and therefore has a larger
adjustable range than that on disk. The previous study of the quasi-hole
tunneling amplitude on disk in Ref.~\cite{Zk2011} indicates that the tunneling
amplitudes have a scaling behavior as a function of the tunneling distance and
the scaling exponents are related to the scaling dimension and the charge of
the transported quasiparticles. However, the scaling behaviors poorly due to
the narrow range of the tunneling distance on disk. Here we systematically
study the quasiparticle tunneling amplitudes of the Laughlin state in the
cylinder geometry which shows a much better scaling behavior. Especially, there
are some corssover behaviors at two length scales when the two open edges are
close to each other. These lengths are also reflected in the bipartite
entanglement and the electron Green's function as either a singularity or a
crossover. These two critical length scales of the edge-edge distance,
$L_x^{c_1}$ and $L_x^{c_2}$, are found to be related to the dimension reduction

magnetism, but contributes most of the solar surface magnetic flux. The study
on its origin has been constrained by the inadequate tempo-spatial resolution
and sensitivity of polarization observations. With dramatic advances in spatial
resolution and detective sensitivity, solar spectro-polarimetry provided by the
Solar Optical Telescope aboard Hinode in an interval from solar minimum to
maximum of cycle 24 opens an unprecedented opportunity to study the cyclic
behavior of solar inter-network magnetic field. More than 1000 Hinode
magnetograms observed from 2007 January to 2014 August are selected in the
study. It has been found that there is a very slight correlation between
sunspot number and magnetic field at the inter-network flux spectrum. From
solar minimum to maximum of cycle 24, the flux density of solar inter-network
field is invariant, which is 10$\pm1$ G. The observations suggest that the
inter-network magnetic field does not arise from the flux diffusion or flux
recycling of solar active regions, thereby indicating the existence of a
locally small-scale dynamo. Combining the full-disk magnetograms observed by
SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI in the same period, we find that the area ratio of the
inter-network region to the full-disk of the Sun apparently decreases from
solar minimum to maximum but always exceeds 60\% even though in the phase of
solar maximum.

the wireless devices (WDs) harvest the radio frequency energy transferred by
dedicated energy nodes (ENs) in the downlink, and use the harvested energy to
transmit data to information access points (APs) in the uplink. In particular,
we are interested in minimizing the network deployment cost with minimum number
of ENs and APs by optimizing their locations, while satisfying the energy
harvesting and communication performance requirements of the WDs. Specifically,
we first study the minimum-cost placement problem when the ENs and APs are
separately located, where an alternating optimization method is proposed to
jointly optimize the locations of ENs and APs. Then, we study the placement
optimization when each pair of EN and AP are co-located and integrated as a
hybrid access point, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem.
Simulation results show that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the

farm service provider who could satisfy their functional and the non functional
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper we propose, a frame work
for Cloud Service Broker (CSB) responsible for the selection and provision of
the cloud based render farm. The Cloud Service Broker matches the functional

the service offerings of the render farm service providers and helps the user
in selecting the right service provider using an aggregate utility function.
The CSB also facilitates the process of Service Level Agreement (SLA)

massive overlapping short reads that are randomly sampled from DNA fragments.
To complete assembling, one needs to finish a fundamental task in many leading
assembly algorithms: counting the number of occurrences of k-mers (length-k
substrings in sequences). The counting results are critical for many components
in assembly (e.g. variants detection and read error correction). For large
genomes, the k-mer counting task can easily consume a huge amount of memory,
making it impossible for large-scale parallel assembly on commodity servers.
  In this paper, we develop MSPKmerCounter, a disk-based approach, to
efficiently perform k-mer counting for large genomes using a small amount of
memory. Our approach is based on a novel technique called Minimum Substring
Partitioning (MSP). MSP breaks short reads into multiple disjoint partitions
such that each partition can be loaded into memory and processed individually.
By leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers derived from the same short read,
MSP can achieve astonishing compression ratio so that the I/O cost can be
significantly reduced. For the task of k-mer counting, MSPKmerCounter offers a
very fast and memory-efficient solution. Experiment results on large real-life
short reads data sets demonstrate that MSPKmerCounter can achieve better
overall performance than state-of-the-art k-mer counting approaches.

of quantum computation; they comprise circuit width, circuit depth, the number
of qubits and ancilla qubits employed, and the overall number of elementary
quantum gate operations as well as more specific gate counts for each
elementary fault-tolerant gate from the standard set {X, Y, Z, H, S, T, CNOT}.
To perform these estimates, we used an approach that combines manual analysis
with automated estimates generated via the Quipper quantum programming language
and compiler. Our estimates pertain to the example problem size N=332,020,680
beyond which, according to a crude big-O complexity comparison, QLSA is
expected to run faster than the best known classical linear-system solving
algorithm. For this problem size, a desired calculation accuracy 0.01 requires
an approximate circuit width 340 and circuit depth of order $10^{25}$ if oracle
costs are excluded, and a circuit width and depth of order $10^8$ and
$10^{29}$, respectively, if oracle costs are included, indicating that the
commonly ignored oracle resources are considerable. In addition to providing
detailed logical resource estimates, it is also the purpose of this paper to
demonstrate explicitly how these impressively large numbers arise with an
actual circuit implementation of a quantum algorithm. While our estimates may
prove to be conservative as more efficient advanced quantum-computation
techniques are developed, they nevertheless provide a valid baseline for
research targeting a reduction of the resource requirements, implying that a
reduction by many orders of magnitude is necessary for the algorithm to become
practical.

general parametrization of the phase noise distribution. Further, a high

symbol-error-rate (SER) floors appear in all cases. The SER floor in the case

independent of the number of antenna elements. In contrast, the SER floor in

Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of

in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR) is essential. Method: We conducted
an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a
rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary
MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process
consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After
discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified,
strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of
our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified
primary MDS studies. E.g. regarding security modelling artefact, we found that
developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches.
The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding
potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the
identified primary MDS studies into 5 principal MDS studies, and other emerging
or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are
given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple
security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains
supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the
application of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the
first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy

proposed static anti-windup analysis and robust performance synthesis
correspond to several optimization goals, ranging from minimization of the

maximization of the domain of attraction. We also introduce a novel paradigm
accounting for uncertainties in the energy of the disturbance inputs. Due to
the special structure of linear static anti-windup design, wherein the design
variables are decoupled from the Lyapunov certificates, we introduce a
significant extension, called scenario with certificates (SwC), of the
so-called scenario approach for uncertain optimization problems. This extension
is of independent interest for similar robust synthesis problems involving
parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. We demonstrate that the scenario with
certificates robust design formulation is appealing because it provides a way
to implicitly design the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and to remove
restrictive assumptions about convexity with respect to the uncertain
parameters. Subsequently, to reduce the computational cost, we present a
sequential randomized algorithm for iteratively solving this problem. The
obtained results are illustrated by numerical examples.

comparisons based prioritization methodology. The issue of ""inconsistency"" in
this context has gained much attention in recent years. The literature provides
us with a number of different ""inconsistency"" indices suggested for measuring
the inconsistency of the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). The latter is
understood as a deviation of the PCM from the ""consistent case"" - a notion that
is formally well-defined in this theory. However the usage of the indices is
justified only by some heuristics. It is still unclear what they really
""measure"". What is even more important and still not known is the relationship
between their values and the ""consistency"" of the decision maker's judgments on
one hand, and the prioritization results upon the other. We provide examples
showing that it is necessary to distinguish between these three following
tasks: the ""measuring"" of the ""PCM inconsistency"" and the PCM-based ""measuring""
of the consistency of decision maker's judgments and, finally, the ""measuring""
of the usefulness of the PCM as a source of information for estimation of the
priority vector (PV). Next we focus on the third task, which seems to be the
most important one in Multi-Criteria Decision Making. With the help of Monte
Carlo experiments, we study the performance of various inconsistency indices as
indicators of the final PV estimation quality. The presented results allow a
deeper understanding of the information contained in these indices and help in
choosing a proper one in a given situation. They also enable us to develop a
new inconsistency characteristic and, based on it, to propose the PCM
acceptance approach that is supported by the classical statistical methodology.

properties, and hence the local gas composition, change dramatically where
temperature inversions occur locally. The cloud opacity is dominated by
absorption in the upper atmosphere and scattering at higher pressures in the

low chemical concentrations with high precision, and much progress has been
made in understanding what sets the fundamental limit to the precision of
chemical sensing. Chemical concentration measurements start with the binding of
ligand molecules to receptor proteins, which is an inherently noisy process,
especially at low concentrations. The signaling networks that transmit the
information on the ligand concentration from the receptors into the cell have
to filter this noise extrinsic to the cell as much as possible. These networks,
however, are also stochastic in nature, which means that they will also add
noise to the transmitted signal. In this review, we will first discuss how the
diffusive transport and binding of ligand to the receptor sets the receptor
correlation time, and then how downstream signaling pathways integrate the
noise in the receptor state; we will discuss how the number of receptors, the
receptor correlation time, and the effective integration time together set a
fundamental limit on the precision of sensing. We then discuss how cells can
remove the receptor noise while simultaneously suppressing the intrinsic noise
in the signaling network. We describe why this mechanism of time integration
requires three classes of resources---receptors and their integration time,
readout molecules, energy---and how each resource class sets a fundamental
sensing limit. We also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum-likelihood
estimation, the role of receptor cooperativity, and how cellular copy protocols
differ from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the computational
literature, explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the
Landauer limit on the optimal trade-off between accuracy and energetic cost.

  For finite-state machines, our proofs characterize infinite behaviors using
existential abstraction and semilinear constraints. For pushdown machines, we

Systems Biology. In these models, the dynamics is generally represented by a
continuous-time Markov chain whose states denote the copy-numbers of the
constituent species. The state-space on which this process resides is a subset
of non-negative integer lattice and for many examples of interest, this
state-space is countably infinite. This causes numerous problems in analyzing
the Markov chain and understanding its long-term behavior. These problems are
further confounded by the presence of conservation relations among species
which constrain the dynamics in complicated ways. In this paper we provide a
linear-algebraic procedure to disentangle these conservation relations and
represent the state-space in a special decomposed form, based on the
copy-number ranges of various species and dependencies among them. This
decomposed form is advantageous for analyzing the stochastic model and for a
large class of networks we demonstrate how this form can be used for finding
all the closed communication classes for the Markov chain within the infinite
state-space. Such communication classes are irreducible state-spaces for the
dynamics and they support all the extremal stationary distributions for the
Markov chain. Hence our results provide important insights into the long-term
behavior and stability properties of stochastic models of reaction networks. We
discuss how the knowledge of these irreducible state-spaces can be used in many
ways such as speeding-up stochastic simulations of multiscale networks or in
identifying the stationary distributions of complex-balanced networks. We
illustrate our results with several examples of gene-expression networks from
Systems Biology.

asynchronous unidirectional rings equipped with whiteboards on nodes. The
partial gathering problem is a new generalization of the total gathering
problem. The partial gathering problem requires, for a given integer $g$, that
each agent should move to a node and terminate so that at least $g$ agents
should meet at the same node. The requirement for the partial gathering problem
is weaker than that for the (well-investigated) total gathering problem, and
thus, we have interests in clarifying the difference on the move complexity
between them. We propose three algorithms to solve the partial gathering
problem. The first algorithm is deterministic but requires unique ID of each
agent. This algorithm achieves the partial gathering in $O(gn)$ total moves,
where $n$ is the number of nodes. The second algorithm is randomized and
requires no unique ID of each agent (i.e., anonymous). This algorithm achieves
the partial gathering in expected $O(gn)$ total moves. The third algorithm is
deterministic and requires no unique ID of each agent. For this case, we show
that there exist initial configurations in which no algorithm can solve the
problem and agents can achieve the partial gathering in $O(kn)$ total moves for
solvable initial configurations, where $k$ is the number of agents. Note that
the total gathering problem requires $\Omega (kn)$ total moves, while the
partial gathering problem requires $\Omega (gn)$ total moves in each model.
Hence, we show that the move complexity of the first and second algorithms is
asymptotically optimal.

and effective temperature bins. The spectra of the stars belonging to the same
gravity/temperature bin were stacked. This approach allowed us to increase by
at least a factor of five the signal-to-noise ratio in the faint limit
(V>20.5mag). We took advantage of the new photometry index cU,B,I introduced by
Monelli et al. (2014), as an age and probably a metallicity indicator, to split
stars along the RGB. These two stellar populations display distinct [Fe/H] and
[Mg/H] distributions: their mean Fe abundances are -2.15$\pm$0.06dex

distributions differ at the 75% level. This supports preliminary results by
Lemasle et al. (2012) and by Monelli et al. (2014). Moreover, we found that the
old and intermediate-age stellar populations have mean [Mg/H] abundances of
-1.91$\pm$0.05dex (sig=0.22) and -1.35$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.22); these differ at

similar abundances for field Halo stars and for cluster (Galactic, Magellanic)
stars. The same outcome applies to nearby dwarf spheroidals and ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies, in the iron range covered by Carina stars. Finally, we found
evidence of a clear correlation between Na and O abundances, thus suggesting
that Carina's chemical enrichment history is quite different than in the
globular clusters.

edges in such images can be reliably detected using only local filters.
Detecting faint edges under high levels of noise cannot be done locally at the
individual pixel level, and requires more sophisticated global processing.
Unfortunately, existing methods that achieve this goal are quite slow. In this
paper we develop a novel multiscale method to detect curved edges in noisy
images. While our algorithm searches for edges over a huge set of candidate
curves, it does so in a practical runtime, nearly linear in the total number of
image pixels. As we demonstrate experimentally, our algorithm is orders of

Nevertheless, it obtains comparable, if not better, edge detection quality on a

improve the accuracy of regression-based methods for computer vision tasks such

this work, we propose a regression model with ConvNets that achieves robustness
to such outliers by minimizing Tukey's biweight function, an M-estimator robust
to outliers, as the loss function for the ConvNet. In addition to the robust
loss, we introduce a coarse-to-fine model, which processes input images of
progressively higher resolutions for improving the accuracy of the regressed
values. In our experiments, we demonstrate faster convergence and better
generalization of our robust loss function for the tasks of human pose

without any prior knowledge about the nature of environments has been a very
challenging issue, especially when the channel states distribution of all
spectrum resources could be entirely or partially stochastic and/or adversarial
at different time and locations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive channel
access algorithm for wireless communications in unknown environments based on
the theory of multi-armed bandits (MAB) problems. By automatically tuning two
control parameters, i.e., learning rate and exploration probability, our
algorithms are capable of finding the optimal channel access strategies and
achieving the almost optimal learning performance over time under our defined
four typical regimes for general unknown environments, e.g., the stochastic
regime where channels follow some unknown i.i.d process, the adversarial regime
where all channels are suffered by adversarial jamming attack, the mixed
stochastic and adversarial regime where a subset of channels are attacked and
the contaminated stochastic regime where occasionally adversarial events
contaminate the stochastic channel process, etc. To reduce the implementation
time and space complexity, we further develop an enhanced algorithm by
exploiting the internal structure of the selection of channel access strategy.
We conduct extensive simulations in all these regimes to validate our
theoretical analysis. The quantitative performance studies indicate the
superior throughput gain and the flexibility of our algorithm in practice,
which is resilient to both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks with
different intelligence and any attacking strength that ranges from no-attack to
the full-attack of all spectrum resources.

regularly detected in the soft X-rays and sometimes in the optical. Only a few
TDEs have been detected at hard X-rays: two are high redshift beamed events,
one of which occurred at the core of a nearby galaxy, and the most recent one
is of a different nature, involving a compact object in the Milky Way. The aims
of this work are to obtain a first sample of hard X-ray-selected unbeamed TDEs,
to determine their frequency and to probe whether TDEs usually or exceptionally
emit at hard X-ray energies. We performed extensive searches for hard X-ray
flares at positions in over 53000 galaxies, up to a distance of 100 Mpc in the
Swift BAT archive. Light curves were extracted and parametrized. The quiescent
hard X-ray emission was used to exclude persistently active galactic nuclei.
Significant flares from non-active galaxies were derived and checked for
possible contamination. We found a sample of nine TDE candidates, which
translates into a rate of $2 \times 10^{-5}\,{\rm galaxy}^{-1}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$
above the BAT detection limit. This rate is consistent with those observed by
XMM-Newton at soft X-rays and in the optical from SDSS observations, and is as
expected from simulations. We conclude that hard X-ray emission should be
ubiquitous in un-beamed TDEs and that electrons should be accelerated in their
accretion flow.

flattens, consistent with the expected weakening interaction. We fit the
potential to both the (a) Cornell and (b) Debye-screened potential forms, with
the latter better reproducing the data. The zero temperature string tension
obtained from (a) agrees with results obtained elsewhere, and it decreases with

densities of species are determined by the interactions between them, together
with the influences from the spatial environments surrounding them. Generally,
the prey species would die out when their birth rate is too low, the habitat
size is too small, the predator grows too fast, or the predation pressure is
too high. To save the endangered prey species, some human interference is
useful, such as creating a protection zone where the prey could cross the
boundary freely but the predator is prohibited from entering. This paper
studies the existence of positive steady states to a predator-prey model with
reaction-diffusion terms, Beddington-DeAngelis type functional response and
non-flux boundary conditions. It is shown that there is a threshold value
$\theta_0$ which characterizes the refuge ability of prey such that the
positivity of prey population can be ensured if either the prey's birth rate
satisfies $\theta\geq\theta_0$ (no matter how large the predator's growth rate
is) or the predator's growth rate satisfies $\mu\le 0$, while a protection zone
$\Omega_0$ is necessary for such positive solutions if $\theta<\theta_0$ with
$\mu>0$ properly large. The more interesting finding is that there is another
threshold value $\theta^*=\theta^*(\mu,\Omega_0)<\theta_0$, such that the
positive solutions do exist for all $\theta\in(\theta^*,\theta_0)$. Letting
$\mu\rightarrow\infty$, we get the third threshold value
$\theta_1=\theta_1(\Omega_0)$ such that if $\theta>\theta_1(\Omega_0)$, prey
species could survive no matter how large the predator's growth rate is. In
addition, we get the fourth threshold value $\theta_*$ for negative $\mu$ such
that the system admits positive steady states if and only if $\theta>\theta_*$.

performance and manageability of future network architectures. However, little
work has gone into using SDN to improve the performance and manageability of
existing networks without requiring a major overhaul of the existing network
infrastructure.
  In this paper, we show how we can dramatically improve, or supercharge, the
performance of existing IP routers by combining them with SDN-enabled equipment
in a novel way. More particularly, our supercharged solution substantially
reduces the convergence time of an IP router upon link or node failure without
inducing any reconfiguration of the IP router itself. Our key insight is to use
the SDN controller to precompute backup forwarding entries and immediately
activate them upon failure, enabling almost immediate data-plane recovery,
while letting the router converge at its typical slow pace. By boosting
existing equipment's performance, we not only increase their lifetime but also
provide new incentives for network operators to kickstart SDN deployment.
  We implemented a fully functional ""supercharger"" and use it to boost the
convergence performance of a Cisco Nexus 7k router. Using a FPGA-based traffic
generator, we show that our supercharged router systematically converges within
~150ms, a 900x reduction with respect to its normal convergence time under
similar conditions.

high latitudes. From observations we know that this field is uncorrelated (or
perhaps even weakly anticorrelated) with the global sunspot cycle. Our aim is
to explore the origin, and particularly the cycle dependence of such a
phenomenon using three-dimensional dynamo simulations. We adopt a simple model
of a turbulent dynamo in a shearing box driven by helically forced turbulence.
Depending on the dynamo parameters, large-scale (global) and small-scale
(local) dynamos can be excited independently in this model. Based on
simulations in different parameter regimes, we find that, when only the
large-scale dynamo is operating in the system, the small-scale magnetic field
generated through shredding and tangling of the large-scale magnetic field is
positively correlated with the global magnetic cycle. However, when both
dynamos are operating, the small-scale field is produced from both the
small-scale dynamo and the tangling of the large-scale field. In this
situation, when the large-scale field is weaker than the equipartition value of
the turbulence, the small-scale field is almost uncorrelated with the
large-scale magnetic cycle. On the other hand, when the large-scale field is
stronger than the equipartition value, we observe an anticorrelation between
the small-scale field and the large-scale magnetic cycle. This anticorrelation
can be interpreted as a suppression of the small-scale dynamo. Based on our
studies we conclude that the observed small-scale magnetic field in the Sun is
generated by the combined mechanisms of small-scale dynamo and tangling of the
large-scale field.

out on transition metal dichalcogenide PdTe2 that is a superconductor with a Tc
at 1.7 K. Combined with theoretical calculations, we have discovered for the
first time the existence of topologically nontrivial surface state with Dirac
cone in PbTe2 superconductor. It is located at the Brillouin zone center and
possesses helical spin texture. Distinct from the usual three-dimensional
topological insulators where the Dirac cone of the surface state lies at the
Fermi level, the Dirac point of the surface state in PdTe2 lies deep below the
Fermi level at ~1.75 eV binding energy and is well separated from the bulk
states. The identification of topological surface state in PdTe2 superconductor
deep below the Fermi level provides a unique system to explore for new
phenomena and properties and opens a door for finding new topological materials
in transition metal chalcogenides.

  Heteroskedastic and Autocorrelated Errors",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers two-sided tests for the parameter of an endogenous
variable in an instrumental variable (IV) model with heteroskedastic and
autocorrelated errors. We develop the finite-sample theory of weighted-average
power (WAP) tests with normal errors and a known long-run variance. We
introduce two weights which are invariant to orthogonal transformations of the
instruments; e.g., changing the order in which the instruments appear. While
tests using the MM1 weight can be severely biased, optimal tests based on the
MM2 weight are naturally two-sided when errors are homoskedastic.
  We propose two boundary conditions that yield two-sided tests whether errors
are homoskedastic or not. The locally unbiased (LU) condition is related to the
power around the null hypothesis and is a weaker requirement than unbiasedness.
The strongly unbiased (SU) condition is more restrictive than LU, but the
associated WAP tests are easier to implement. Several tests are SU in finite
samples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the
Anderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I. Andrews'
(2015) PI-CLC tests) and two-sided tests which are optimal when the sample size
is large and instruments are strong.
  We refer to the WAP-SU tests based on our weights as MM1-SU and MM2-SU tests.
Dropping the restrictive assumptions of normality and known variance, the
theory is shown to remain valid at the cost of asymptotic approximations. The
MM2-SU test is optimal under the strong IV asymptotics, and outperforms other
existing tests under the weak IV asymptotics.

indicate that observed features near 6000-6400 Ang in type I spectra are due to
more than Si II 6355. However, while an interpretation of conspicuous Si II
6355 can approximate 6150 Ang absorption features for all type Ia supernovae
during the first month of free expansion, similar identifications applied to
6250 Ang features of type Ib and Ic supernovae have not been as successful.
When the corresponding synthetic spectra are compared to high quality
time-series observations, the computed spectra are frequently too blue in
wavelength. Some improvement can be achieved with Fe II lines that contribute
red-ward of 6150 Ang, however the computed spectra either remain too blue, or
the spectrum only reaches fair agreement when the rise-time to peak brightness
of the model conflicts with observations by a factor of two. This degree of
disagreement brings into question the proposed explosion scenario. Similarly, a
detection of strong Si II 6355 in the spectra of broad-lined Ic and
super-luminous events of type I/R is less convincing despite numerous model
spectra used to show otherwise. Alternatively, we suggest 6000-6400 Ang
features are possibly influenced by either trace amounts of hydrogen, or
blue-shifted absorption and emission in Halpha, the latter being an effect
which is frequently observed in the spectra of hydrogen-rich, type II
supernovae.

of O. Ore states that a finite group is cyclic if and only if its subgroups
lattice is distributive, and on the other hand, every subgroup of a cyclic
group is normal. Then, a subfactor planar algebra is called cyclic if all the
biprojections are normal and form a distributive lattice. The main result shows
in what sense a cyclic subfactor is singly generated, by generalizing one side
of Ore's theorem as follows: if a subfactor planar algebra is cyclic then it is
weakly cyclic (or w-cyclic), i.e. there is a minimal 2-box projection
generating the identity biprojection. Some extensions of this result are
discussed, and some applications of it are given in subfactors, quantum groups

the worst-case (WC) error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a

considers the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching
algorithms, when data are generated according to a statistical linear model. In
this paper, we provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to
insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for
assessing, in a unified manner, algorithmic and statistical aspects of
randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction
efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS
estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types

formation is the problem of identifying a team $C \subseteq V$ that is both
competent in performing the task $\mathcal{T}$ and compatible in working
together. Existing methods for this problem make too restrictive assumptions
and thus cannot model practical scenarios. The goal of this paper is to
consider the team formation problem in a realistic setting and present a novel
formulation based on densest subgraphs. Our formulation allows modeling of many
natural requirements such as (i) inclusion of a designated team leader and/or a
group of given experts, (ii) restriction of the size or more generally cost of
the team (iii) enforcing locality of the team, e.g., in a geographical sense or
social sense, etc.
  The proposed formulation leads to a generalized version of the classical
densest subgraph problem with cardinality constraints (DSP), which is an NP
hard problem and has many applications in social network analysis. In this
paper, we present a new method for (approximately) solving the generalized DSP
(GDSP). Our method, FORTE, is based on solving an equivalent continuous
relaxation of GDSP. The solution found by our method has a quality guarantee
and always satisfies the constraints of GDSP. Experiments show that the
proposed formulation (GDSP) is useful in modeling a broader range of team
formation problems and that our method produces more coherent and compact teams
of high quality. We also show, with the help of an LP relaxation of GDSP, that
our method gives close to optimal solutions to GDSP.

described by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and by the open-dissipative
Gross-Pitaevskii equation including a separate equation for the reservoir
density. In particular, we focus on the validity of the adiabatic approximation
that allows to reduce the coupled condensate-reservoir dynamics to a single
partial differential equation. We find that the adiabatic approximation
consists of three independent analytical conditions that have to be fulfilled
simultaneously. By investigating stochastic versions of the two corresponding
models, we verify that the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation can lead to
discrepancies in correlation lengths and distributions of fluctuations.
Additionally, we consider the phase diffusion and number fluctuations of a
condensate in a box, and show that self-consistent description requires
treatment beyond the typical Bogoliubov approximation.

transportation systems. Failures in their operations can have serious impacts
on urban mobility, and measuring their robustness is therefore critical.
Moreover, as physical networks, metros can be viewed as network topological
entities, and as such they possess measurable network properties. In this
paper, by using network science and graph theoretical concepts, we investigate
both theoretical and experimental robustness metrics (i.e., the robustness
indicator, the effective graph conductance, and the critical thresholds) and
their performance in quantifying the robustness of metro networks under random
failures or targeted attacks. We find that the theoretical metrics quantify
different aspects of the robustness of metro networks. In particular, the
robustness indicator captures the number of alternative paths and the effective
graph conductance focuses on the length of each path. Moreover, the high
positive correlation between the theoretical metrics and experimental metrics
and the negative correlation within the theoretical metrics provide significant
insights for planners to design more robust system while accommodating for
transit specificities (e.g., alternative paths, fast transferring).

involving only crossings between different components. We further generalize
this family of invariants to a new $3$-variable skein link invariant which is

observed in the X-ray power-density spectra of several microquasars and low
mass X-ray binaries. Two distinct QPO peaks, so-called twin peak QPOs, are
often detected simultaneously exhibiting their frequency ratio close or equal
to 3/2. Following the analytic theory and previous studies of observable
spectral signatures, we aim to model the twin peak QPOs as a spectral imprint
of specific dual oscillation regime defined by a combination of the lowest
radial and vertical oscillation mode of optically thick slender tori with
constant specific angular momentum. We examined power spectra and fluorescent
K$\alpha$ iron line profiles for two different simulation setups with the mode
frequency relations corresponding to the epicyclic resonance HF QPOs model and
modified relativistic precession QPOs model. We use relativistic ray-tracing
implemented in parallel simulation code LSDplus. In the background of the Kerr
spacetime geometry, we analyze the influence of the distant observer
inclination and the spin of the central compact object. Relativistic optical
projection of the oscillating slender torus is illustrated by images in false
colours related to the frequency shift. We show that performed simulations
yield power spectra with the pair of dominant peaks corresponding to the
frequencies of radial and vertical oscillation modes with the proper ratio
equal to 3/2 on a wide range of inclinations and spin values. We also discuss
exceptional cases of a very small and very high inclination as well as unstable
high spin relativistic precession-like configuration predicting constant
frequency ratio equal to 1/2. We demonstrate signifiant dependency of broadened
K$\alpha$ iron line profiles on the inclination of the distant observer.

the viscous damping of the particle by the solvent, the slow relaxation results

column collapses have been conducted using three-dimensional (3D) granular
materials in narrow horizontal channels (i.e., quasi-2D condition). Our recent
research on 2D granular column collapses by using 2D granular materials (i.e.,
aluminum rods) has revealed results that differ markedly from those reported in
the literature. We assume a 2D column with an initial height of h0 and initial
width of d0, a defined as their ratio (a =h0/d0), a final height of h , and
maximum run-out distance of d . The experimental data suggest that for the low
a regime (a <0.65) the ratio of the final height to initial height is 1.
However, for the high a regime (a >0.65), the ratio of a to (d-d0)/d0, h0/h ,
or d/d0 is expressed by power-law relations. In particular, the following
power-function ratios (h0/h=1.42a^2/3 and d/d0=4.30a^0.72) are proposed for
every a >0.65. In contrast, the ratio (d-d0)/d0=3.25a^0.96 only holds for 0.65<
a< 1.5, whereas the ratio (d-d0)/d0=3.80a^0.73 holds for a>1.5. In addition,
the influence of ground contact surfaces (hard or soft beds) on the final
run-out distance and destruction zone of the granular column under true 2D
conditions is investigated.

"1607.07398","Andrea Saltelli","Andrea Saltelli, Mario Giampietro","The fallacy of evidence based policy",,,"10.1016/j.futures.2016.11.012",,"q-fin.EC physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of science for policy is at the core of a perfect storm generated by
the insurgence of several concurrent crises: of science, of trust, of
sustainability. The modern positivistic model of science for policy, known as
evidence based policy, is based on dramatic simplifications and compressions of
available perceptions of the state of affairs and possible explanations
(hypocognition). This model can result in flawed prescriptions. The flaws
become more evident when dealing with complex issues characterized by
concomitant uncertainties in the normative, descriptive and ethical domains. In
this situation evidence-based policy may concur to the fragility of the social
system. Science plays an important role in reducing the feeling of
vulnerability of humans by projecting a promise of protection against
uncertainties. In many applications quantitative science is used to remove
uncertainty by transforming it into probability, so that mathematical modelling
can play the ritual role of haruspices. This epistemic governance arrangement
is today in crisis. The primacy of science to adjudicate political issues must
pass through an assessment of the level of maturity and effectiveness of the
various disciplines deployed. The solution implies abandoning dreams of
prediction, control and optimization obtained by relying on a limited set of
simplified narratives to define the problem and moving instead to an open
exploration of a broader set of plausible and relevant stories. Evidence based
policy has to be replaced by robust policy, where robustness is tested with
respect to feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control);
viability (compatibility with processes under human control, in relation to
both the economic and technical dimensions), and desirability domain
(compatibility with a plurality of normative considerations relevant to a
plurality of actors).
