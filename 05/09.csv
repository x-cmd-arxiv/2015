represent and reason about description logics and rule languages for the
semantic web.
  Specifically, we introduce the description logic $\mathcal{DL}\langle
4LQS^R\rangle(\D)$--admitting features such as min/max cardinality constructs
on the left-hand/right-hand side of inclusion axioms, role chain axioms, and
datatypes--which turns out to be quite expressive if compared with
$\mathcal{SROIQ}(\D)$, the description logic underpinning the Web Ontology
Language OWL. Then we show that the consistency problem for
$\mathcal{DL}\langle 4LQS^R\rangle(\D)$-knowledge bases is decidable by
reducing it, through a suitable translation process, to the satisfiability
problem of the stratified fragment $4LQS^R$ of set theory, involving variables
of four sorts and a restricted form of quantification. We prove also that,
under suitable not very restrictive constraints, the consistency problem for
$\mathcal{DL}\langle 4LQS^R\rangle(\D)$-knowledge bases is
\textbf{NP}-complete. Finally, we provide a $4LQS^R$-translation of rules
belonging to the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL).

CPT-violating see-saw involves a sterile partner of the neutron, living in a

(antineutrons) can communicate with the hidden sector through non-perturbative
quantum gravity effects called {\it exotic instantons}. Exotic instantons
dynamically break R-parity, generating one effective vertex between the neutron

(which is a scheme defined over the field with one element, $\mathbb{F}_1$) to
a so-called ""loose graph"" (which is a generalization of a graph). Several
properties of the Deitmar scheme can be proven easily from the combinatorics of
the (loose) graph, and known realizations of objects over $\mathbb{F}_1$ such
as combinatorial $\mathbb{F}_1$-projective and $\mathbb{F}_1$-affine spaces
exactly depict the loose graph which corresponds to the associated Deitmar
scheme. In this paper, we first modify the construction of loc. cit., and show
that Deitmar schemes which are defined by finite trees (with possible end
points) are ""defined over $\mathbb{F}_1$"" in Kurokawa's sense; we then derive a
precise formula for the Kurokawa zeta function for such schemes (and so also
for the counting polynomial of all associated $\mathbb{F}_q$-schemes). As a
corollary, we find a zeta function for all such trees which contains
information such as the number of inner points and the spectrum of degrees, and
which is thus very different than Ihara's zeta function (which is trivial in
this case). Using a process called ""surgery,"" we show that one can determine
the zeta function of a general loose graph and its associated { Deitmar,
Grothendieck }-schemes in a number of steps, eventually reducing the
calculation essentially to trees. We study a number of classes of examples of
loose graphs, and introduce the Grothendieck ring of $\mathbb{F}_1$-schemes
along the way in order to perform the calculations. Finally, we compare the new
zeta function to Ihara's zeta function for graphs in a number of examples, and
include a computer program for performing more tedious calculations.

the presence of vertical threads and coronal cavities. Associated flares and

also examine the kinematics of 106 limb events to characterize the distinct
slow- and fast-rise phases often exhibited by filament eruptions. The average
fast-rise onset height, slow-rise duration, slow-rise velocity, maximum
field-of-view (FOV) velocity, and maximum FOV acceleration are 83 Mm, 4.4

correlation between latitude and fast-rise onset height is found, which we
attribute to a corresponding negative correlation in the average vertical
magnetic field gradient, or decay index, estimated from potential field source
surface (PFSS) extrapolations. We also find the decay index at the fast-rise
onset point to be 1.1 on average, consistent with the critical instability
threshold theorized for straight current channels. Finally, we explore
relationships between the derived kinematics properties and apparent twisting
motions. We find that events with evident twist have significantly faster CME

relationships between these values and flux rope helicity.

Furthermore, we find that the source flux clearly correlates with the spectral
hardness throughout all orbital phases, and that the broadband X-ray spectra
measured with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift are well fit with an unbroken
power-law model. This spectrum suggests that the system may not be
accretion-powered.

namely, constructing confidence intervals for (1) the error of a
high-dimensional ($p>n$) regression estimator, (2) the linear regression noise
level, and (3) the genetic signal-to-noise ratio of a continuous-valued trait
(related to the heritability). All three problems turn out to be closely
related to the little-studied problem of performing inference on the
$\ell_2$-norm of the signal in high-dimensional linear regression. We derive a
novel procedure for this, which is asymptotically correct when the covariates
are multivariate Gaussian and produces valid confidence intervals in finite
samples as well. The procedure, called EigenPrism, is computationally fast and
makes no assumptions on coefficient sparsity or knowledge of the noise level.
We investigate the width of the EigenPrism confidence intervals, including a
comparison with a Bayesian setting in which our interval is just 5% wider than
the Bayes credible interval. We are then able to unify the three aforementioned
problems by showing that the EigenPrism procedure with only minor modifications
is able to make important contributions to all three. We also investigate the
robustness of coverage and find that the method applies in practice and in
finite samples much more widely than just the case of multivariate Gaussian
covariates. Finally, we apply EigenPrism to a genetic dataset to estimate the
genetic signal-to-noise ratio for a number of continuous phenotypes.

brightening observed in K band at pericenter passage of the star known as S2

properties of S2 that contribute to lobe filling are 1) the enormous mass

eccentricity. Published estimates have given limiting lobe sizes of order 100
to 300 $R_\odot$ but, with S2's fast rotation taken into account, the computed
lobe size is much smaller, being compatible with either a main sequence OB star
or a stripped evolved star. An important evolutionary consideration that
predicts very large pericenter overflows is envelope expansion following mass
loss that is characteristic of highly evolved stars. Material removed by lobe
overflow at pericenter is replenished by envelope expansion as an evolved star
awaits its next pericenter passage. An observational signature of lobe overflow
for upcoming pericenter passages would be appearance of emission lines as the
ejected gas expands and becomes optically thin.

frequency and high signal-to-noise ratio. Statistical tests developed for the
analysis of quasar differential light curves usually show either low power or
low reliability, or both. In this paper we compare two statistical procedures

non-variable stars, and analyze them with statistical procedures developed from
the F-test and the analysis of variance. The results show a large improvement

be obtained from short and long time scale variability studies. These
techniques are not limited to quasar variability; on the contrary, they can be
easily implemented to other sources such as variable stars. Their applications

fingering (VF) between the displacing fluid and sample solvent. We use a
Fourier pseudo-spectral method to solve the initial value problem appeared in
the linear stability analysis. The present linear stability analysis is of
generic type and it captures the early time diffusion dominated region which
was never expressible through the quasi-steady state analysis (QSSA). In
addition, it measures the onset of instability more accurately than the QSSA
methods. It is shown that the onset time depends non-monotonically on the
retention parameter of the solute adsorption. This qualitative influence of the
retention parameter on the onset of instability resemblances with the results
obtained from direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear equations.
Moreover, the present linear stability method helps for an appropriate
characterisation of the linear and the nonlinear regimes of miscible VF
instability and also can be useful for the fluid flow problems with the
unsteady base-state.

quantization design algorithms are presented to protect the primary from
quantization error while minimizing the white space area declared as protected

generalizes many existing turbulence models in a closed-form expression and

gas must cross before it can be accreted. A magnetic field is likely carried
into the gap, potentially influencing the flow. Gap crossing has been simulated
with varying degrees of attention to field evolution (pure hydrodynamical,
ideal, and resistive MHD), but as yet there has been no detailed assessment of
the role of the field accounting for all three key non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic
resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift. We present a detailed
investigation of gap magnetic field structure as determined by non-ideal
effects. We assess susceptibility to turbulence induced by the
magnetorotational instability, and angular momentum loss from large-scale
fields. As full non-ideal simulations are computationally expensive, we take an
a posteriori approach, estimating MHD quantities from the pure hydrodynamical
gap crossing simulation by Tanigawa et al. (2012). We calculate the ionisation
fraction and estimate field strength and geometry to determine the strength of
non-ideal effects. We find that the protoplanetary disc field would be easily
drawn into the gap and circumplanetary disc. Hall drift dominates, so that much
of the gap is conditionally MRI unstable depending on the alignment of the
field and disc rotation axes. Field alignment also influences the strong
toroidal field component permeating the gap. Large-scale magnetic forces are
small in the circumplanetary disc, indicating they cannot drive accretion
there. However, turbulence will be key during satellite growth as it affects
critical disc features, such as the location of the ice line.

Andromeda XXVIII and Andromeda XXIX with Gemini/GMOS and Keck/DEIMOS. Both
galaxies are shown to host old, metal-poor stellar populations with no
detectable recent star formation, conclusively identifying both of them as
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). And XXVIII exhibits a complex horizontal
branch morphology, which is suggestive of metallicity enrichment and thus an
extended period of star formation in the past. Decomposing the horizontal
branch into blue (metal poor, assumed to be older) and red (relatively more
metal rich, assumed to be younger) populations shows that the metal rich are
also more spatially concentrated in the center of the galaxy. We use
spectroscopic measurements of the Calcium triplet, combined with the improved
precision of the Gemini photometry, to measure the metallicity of the galaxies,
confirming the metallicity spread and showing that they both lie on the
luminosity-metallicity relation for dwarf satellites. Taken together, the
galaxies exhibit largely typical properties for dSphs despite their significant
distances from M31. These dwarfs thus place particularly significant
constraints on models of dSph formation involving environmental processes such
as tidal or ram pressure stripping. Such models must be able to completely
transform the two galaxies into dSphs in no more than two pericentric passages
around M31, while maintaining a significant stellar populations gradient.
Reproducing these features is a prime requirement for models of dSph formation
to demonstrate not just the plausibility of environmental transformation but
the capability of accurately recreating real dSphs.

fluctuations around the instanton profiles describing the most likely initial
bubble profile. Past studies of this problem neglect these fluctuations and
work under the assumption that the collisions posess an exact SO(2,1) symmetry.
We use three-dimensional lattice simulations to demonstrate that for
double-well potentials, small initial perturbations to this symmetry can be
amplified as the system evolves. Initially the amplification is well-described
by linear perturbation theory around the SO(2,1) background, but the onset of
strong nonlinearities amongst the fluctuations quickly leads to a drastic
breaking of the original SO(2,1) symmetry and the production of oscillons in
the collision region. We explore several single-field models, and we find it is
hard to both realize inflation inside of a bubble and produce oscillons in a
collision. Finally, we extend our results to a simple two-field model. The
additional freedom allowed by the second field allows us to construct viable
inflationary models that allow oscillon production in collisions. The breaking
of the SO(2,1) symmetry allows for a new class of observational signatures from
bubble collisions that do not posess azimuthal symmetry, including the
production of gravitational waves which cannot be supported by an SO(2,1)

mechanism for angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). The
VSI is driven by a weak vertical gradient in the disk's orbital motion, but
must overcome vertical buoyancy, a strongly stabilizing influence in cold
disks, where heating is dominated by external irradiation. Rapid radiative
cooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate. We
quantify the cooling timescale $t_c$ needed for efficient VSI growth, through a
linear analysis of the VSI with cooling in vertically global, radially local
disk models. We find the VSI is most vigorous for rapid cooling with
$t_c<\Omega_\mathrm{K}^{-1}h|q|/(\gamma -1)$ in terms of the Keplerian orbital
frequency, $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$; the disk's aspect-ratio, $h\ll1$; the radial
power-law temperature gradient, $q$; and the adiabatic index, $\gamma$. For
longer $t_c$, the VSI is much less effective because growth slows and shifts to
smaller length scales, which are more prone to viscous or turbulent decay. We
apply our results to PPD models where $t_c$ is determined by the opacity of
dust grains. We find that the VSI is most effective at intermediate radii, from
$\sim5$AU to $\sim50$AU with a characteristic growth time of $\sim30$ local
orbital periods. Growth is suppressed by long cooling times both in the opaque
inner disk and the optically thin outer disk. Reducing the dust opacity by a
factor of 10 increases cooling times enough to quench the VSI at all disk
radii. Thus the formation of solid protoplanets, a sink for dust grains, can
impede the VSI.

\textit{Fermi}-type acceleration accomplished by the particle curvature drift

the acceleration mechanism is similar for different plasma $\beta$, low-$\beta$
reconnection drives fast acceleration on Alfv\'enic timescales and develops
power laws out of thermal distribution. The nonthermally dominated acceleration
resulting from magnetic reconnection in low-$\beta$ plasma may have strong
implications for the highly efficient electron acceleration in solar flares and

obliquity of the Earth influence our climate by modulating the summer
insolation at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Despite considerable
success of this theory in explaining climate change over the Pleistocene epoch
(2.6 to 0.01 Myr ago), it is inconclusive with regard to which combination of
orbital elements paced the 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles over the late
Pleistocene. Here we explore the role of the orbital elements in pacing the
Pleistocene deglaciations by modeling ice-volume variations in a Bayesian
approach. When comparing models, this approach takes into account the
uncertainties in the data as well as the different degrees of model complexity.
We find that the Earth's obliquity (axial tilt) plays a dominant role in pacing
the glacial cycles over the whole Pleistocene, while precession only becomes
important in pacing major deglaciations after the transition of the dominant
period from 41 kyr to 100 kyr (the mid-Pleistocene transition). We also find
that geomagnetic field and orbital inclination variations are unlikely to have
paced the Pleistocene deglaciations. We estimate that the mid-Pleistocene
transition took place over a 220 kyr interval centered on a time 715 kyr ago,
although the data permit a range of 600--1000 kyr. This transition, occurring
within just two 100\,kyr cycles, indicates a relatively rapid change in the

energetically stabilized even for condensates with attractive intra- and

interdisciplinary interest. Recently, dynamic message-passing (DMP) has been
proposed as an efficient algorithm for simulating epidemic models on networks,
and in particular for estimating the probability that a given node will become
infectious at a particular time. To date, DMP has been applied exclusively to
models with one-way state changes, as opposed to models like SIS
(susceptible-infectious-susceptible) and SIRS
(susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible) where nodes can return to
previously inhabited states. Because many real-world epidemics can exhibit such
recurrent dynamics, we propose a DMP algorithm for complex, recurrent epidemic
models on networks. Our approach takes correlations between neighboring nodes
into account while preventing causal signals from backtracking to their
immediate source, and thus avoids ""echo chamber effects"" where a pair of
adjacent nodes each amplify the probability that the other is infectious. We
demonstrate that this approach well approximates results obtained from Monte
Carlo simulation and that its accuracy is often superior to the pair
approximation (which also takes second-order correlations into account).
Moreover, our approach is more computationally efficient than the pair
approximation, especially for complex epidemic models: the number of variables
in our DMP approach grows as $2mk$ where $m$ is the number of edges and $k$ is
the number of states, as opposed to $mk^2$ for the pair approximation. We
suspect that the resulting reduction in computational effort, as well as the
conceptual simplicity of DMP, will make it a useful tool in epidemic modeling,
especially for inference tasks where there is a large parameter space to
explore.

Small-world structure, commonly diagnosed by high local clustering yet short

coupled systems, a key function that can differ across conditions or between
groups. However, current techniques to quantify small-world structure are
dependent on nuisance variables such as density and agnostic to critical
variables such as the strengths of connections between nodes, thereby hampering
accurate and comparable assessments of small-world structure in different
networks. Here, we address both limitations with a novel metric called the
Small-World Propensity (SWP). In its binary instantiation, the SWP provides an
unbiased assessment of small-world structure in networks of varying densities.
We extend this concept to the case of weighted networks by developing (i) a
standardized procedure for generating weighted small-world networks, (ii) a
weighted extension of the SWP, and (iii) a stringent and generalizable method
for mapping real-world data onto the theoretical model. In applying these
techniques to real world brain networks, we uncover the surprising fact that
the canonical example of a biological small-world network, the C. elegans
neuronal network, has strikingly low SWP in comparison to other examined brain
networks. These metrics, models, and maps form a coherent toolbox for the
assessment of architectural properties in real-world networks and their
statistical comparison across conditions.

multi-player, multi-state evolutionary game, in which the fitness of an agent
is determined by its relationship to an arbitrary number of other agents. We

can undergo a ratchet effect that produces a net dc motion of the particle.
Ratchet effects have been observed in numerous systems such as superconducting
vortices on asymmetric pinning substrates. Skyrmions, stable topological spin
textures with particle-like properties, have many similarities to vortices but
their behavior is strongly influenced by non-disspative effects arising from a
Magnus term in their equation of motion. We show using numerical simulations
that pronounced ratchet effects can occur for ac driven skyrmions moving over
asymmetric quasi-one-dimensional substrates. We find a new type of ratchet
effect called a Magnus-induced transverse ratchet that arises when the ac
driving force is applied perpendicular rather than parallel to the asymmetry
direction of the substrate. This transverse ratchet effect only occurs when the
Magnus term is finite, and the threshold ac amplitude needed to induce it
decreases as the Magnus term becomes more prominent. Ratcheting skyrmions
follow ordered orbits in which the net displacement parallel to the substrate
asymmetry direction is quantized. Skyrmion ratchets represent a new ac
current-based method for controlling skyrmion positions and motion for
spintronic applications.

consistently extend such advancement to feedback networks. The main obstacle
that hampers is the circulative propagation of fluctuation by feedback loops.
In order to define the relevant quantity for the impact of feedback loops for

to infer non-perturbatively the influence of the feedback to fluctuation as the

we define feedback loop gain as the feedback efficiency that is consistent with
the fluctuation decomposition for feedforward networks. Then, we clarify the

selection is regarded as passive information compression, and the loss of
fitness from the optimal strategy is shown to satisfy various FRs that
constrain the average and fluctuation of the loss. These results are naturally
extended to the situation that organisms can use an environmental signal by
actively sensing the environment. FRs of fitness gain by sensing are derived in

null hypothesis of statistical independence on all variable pairs using a
non-parametric measure of dependence. However, because this approach attempts
to identify any non-trivial relationship no matter how weak, it often
identifies too many relationships to be useful. What is needed is a way of
identifying a smaller set of relationships that merit detailed further
analysis.
  Here we formally present and characterize equitability, a property of
measures of dependence that aims to overcome this challenge. Notionally, an
equitable statistic is a statistic that, given some measure of noise, assigns
similar scores to equally noisy relationships of different types [Reshef et al.
2011]. We begin by formalizing this idea via a new object called the
interpretable interval, which functions as an interval estimate of the amount
of noise in a relationship of unknown type. We define an equitable statistic as
one with small interpretable intervals.
  We then draw on the equivalence of interval estimation and hypothesis testing
to show that under moderate assumptions an equitable statistic is one that
yields well powered tests for distinguishing not only between trivial and
non-trivial relationships of all kinds but also between non-trivial
relationships of different strengths. This means that equitability allows us to
specify a threshold relationship strength $x_0$ and to search for relationships
of all kinds with strength greater than $x_0$. Thus, equitability can be
thought of as a strengthening of power against independence that enables
fruitful analysis of data sets with a small number of strong, interesting
relationships and a large number of weaker ones. We conclude with a

relationships within it. A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of
dependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for
follow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef
et al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores
to equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,
exponential, periodic).
  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of
dependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the
population value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al.
2011], as a canonical ""smoothing"" of mutual information, and as the supremum of
an infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of
the marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an
efficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random
variables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is
efficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time
algorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through
simulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then
introduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a
trivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful
independence testing rather than equitability.
  We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power
against independence respectively. The analyses here complement a more in-depth
empirical evaluation of several leading measures of dependence [Reshef et al.
2015b] that shows state-of-the-art performance for MICe and TICe.

promising pairwise associations for further analysis while filtering out
weaker, less interesting ones. This can be accomplished by computing a measure
of dependence on all variable pairs and examining the highest-scoring pairs,
provided the measure of dependence used assigns similar scores to equally noisy
relationships of different types. This property, called equitability, is
formalized in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In addition to equitability, measures of
dependence can also be assessed by the power of their corresponding
independence tests as well as their runtime.
  Here we present extensive empirical evaluation of the equitability, power
against independence, and runtime of several leading measures of dependence.
These include two statistics introduced in Reshef et al. [2015a]: MICe, which
has equitability as its primary goal, and TICe, which has power against
independence as its goal. Regarding equitability, our analysis finds that MICe
is the most equitable method on functional relationships in most of the
settings we considered, although mutual information estimation proves the most
equitable at large sample sizes in some specific settings. Regarding power
against independence, we find that TICe, along with Heller and Gorfine's S^DDP,
is the state of the art on the relationships we tested. Our analyses also show
a trade-off between power against independence and equitability consistent with
the theory in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In terms of runtime, MICe and TICe are
significantly faster than many other measures of dependence tested, and
computing either one makes computing the other trivial. This suggests that a
fast and useful strategy for achieving a combination of power against
independence and equitability may be to filter relationships by TICe and then
to examine the MICe of only the significant ones.

recent simulations incorporating all sources of isospin breaking. For Wilson
fermions, we find that the phase diagram is unaffected by the inclusion of
electromagnetism---the only effect is to raise the charged pion masses. For
maximally twisted fermions, we previously took the twist and isospin-breaking
directions to be different, in order that the fermion determinant is real and
positive. However, this is incompatible with electromagnetic gauge invariance,
and so here we take the twist to be in the isospin-breaking direction,

which has not previously been studied. The results differ from those obtained
with different twist and isospin directions. One practical issue when including

show that one of the criteria suggested to determine these critical masses does
not work, and propose an alternative.

Mercury's are thought to have experienced extensive atmospheric evolution. Here
we propose that a potential outcome of this atmospheric evolution is the
formation of helium-dominated atmospheres. The hydrodynamic escape rates of
Neptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the
diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily
affected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium
atmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere
-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere
has very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of
a hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission
spectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated
atmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm
Neptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.
This model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,
with the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our
atmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere
envelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen
abundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion
years. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium
atmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets.

operational information-theoretic principles to identify the common essence of
all such measures, thereby defining measure-independent notions of uncertainty
and joint uncertainty. We find that most existing entropic uncertainty
relations use measures of joint uncertainty that yield themselves to a small
class of operational interpretations. Our notion relaxes this restriction,
revealing previously unexplored joint uncertainty measures. To illustrate the
utility of our formalism, we derive an uncertainty relation based on one such
new measure. We also use our formalism to gain insight into the conditions

for an unlabeled graph so that an agent, walking from node to node, can
uniquely determine its location from just the observed color sequence of the
walk?
  Specifically, let G(n,d) be an edge-colored subgraph of d-dimensional
(directed or undirected) lattice of size n^d = n * n * ... * n. We say that
G(n,d) is t-observable if an agent can uniquely determine its current position
in the graph from the color sequence of any t-dimensional walk, where the
dimension is the number of different directions spanned by the edges of the
walk. A walk in an undirected lattice G(n,d) has dimension between 1 and d, but
a directed walk can have dimension between 1 and 2d because of two different
orientations for each axis.
  We derive bounds on the number of colors needed for t-observability. Our main
result is that Theta(n^(d/t)) colors are both necessary and sufficient for
t-observability of G(n,d), where d is considered a constant.
  This shows an interesting dependence of graph observability on the ratio
between the dimension of the lattice and that of the walk. In particular, the
number of colors for full-dimensional walks is Theta(n^(1/2)) in the directed
case, and Theta(n) in the undirected case, independent of the lattice
dimension.
  All of our results extend easily to non-square lattices: given a lattice
graph of size N = n_1 * n_2 * ... * n_d, the number of colors for
t-observability is Theta (N^(1/t)).

Unlike previous algorithms of similar flavor, our method works with

lies in the fact that our algorithm actually elucidates the topological reason
that makes computation on 2-manifolds easy. This is made possible owing to a
new simple homotopy based construct that is referred to as \emph{expansion

programming based computation of discrete Morse boundary operator. The
efficient design of optimal gradient vector field followed by fast computation
of boundary operator affords us near linearity in computation of homology
groups. Moreover, we define a new criterion for nearly optimal Morse functions

measurements down to 0.5 K. A pronounced positive curvature in the $H_{c2}$-$T$
phase diagram was observed in the whole temperature range below $T_c$. The
Seebeck coefficient $S(T)$ in the temperature range 5K$\leq$$T$$\leq$350K was
found to be negative in sign, modest in magnitude and non-linear in
temperature. In addition, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$
under hydrostatic pressure shows a marked non-monotonic variation, decreasing
initially with the applied pressure up to $P_c$$\sim$5-10 kbar but then rising
with further pressurization. The underlying physical mechanisms of all these

decoherence and energy relaxation in the quantum-classical dynamics of charge
transport in organic semiconducting crystals. These effects, originating from
environmental fluctuations, are essential ingredients of the carrier dynamics.
The IDC is carried out by measurement-like operations in the adiabatic
representation. While decoherence is inherent in the IDC, energy relaxation is
taken into account by considering the detailed balance through the introduction
of energy-dependent reweighing factors, which could be either Boltzmann
(IDC-BM) or Miller-Abrahams (IDC-MA) type. For a non-diagonal electron-phonon
coupling model, it is shown that the IDC tends to enhance diffusion while
energy relaxation weakens this enhancement. As expected, both the IDC-BM and
IDC-MA achieve a near-equilibrium distribution at finite temperatures in the
diffusion process, while the Ehrenfest dynamics renders system tending to
infinite temperature limit. The resulting energy relaxation times with the two
kinds of factors lie in different regimes and exhibit different dependence on
temperature, decoherence time and electron-phonon coupling strength, due to
different dominant relaxation process.

family X/S of smooth projective varieties in characteristic zero, it is known
that the parameter scheme S has a set theoretic stratification by locally
closed subsets which correspond to the Harder-Narasimhan types of the
restriction of the principal bundle to the various fibers of X/S. We show that
each of these subsets has in fact the structure of a locally closed subscheme
of the parameter scheme S, with the following universal property: Under any
base change, the pullback family admits a relative Harder-Narasimhan filtration
(defined appropriately) with a given Harder-Narasimhan type if and only if the
base change factors via the schematic stratum corresponding to that
Harder-Narasimhan type. It follows that principal bundles of any given
Harder-Narasimhan type on X/S form an Artin algebraic stack over S, and as the
Harder-Narasimhan type varies, these stacks define a stratification the stack
of all principal G-bundles on X/S by locally closed substacks.
  This result extends to principal bundles in higher dimensions our earlier
similar results which were proved for principal bundles on families of curves.
The result is new even for vector bundles, that is, for G = GL(n).

higher-order Poincar\'e (HOP) sphere, where superpositions of spin and orbital
angular momentum states give rise to laser beams that have found many
applications, including optical communication, quantum information processing,
microscopy, optical trapping and tweezing and materials processing. Many
techniques exist to create such beams but none to date allow their creation at
the source. Here we report on a new class of laser that is able to generate all
states on the HOP sphere. We exploit geometric phase control with a
non-homogenous polarization optic and a wave-plate inside a laser cavity to map
spin angular momentum (SAM) to orbital angular momentum (OAM). Rotation of
these two elements provides the necessary degrees of freedom to traverse the
entire HOP sphere. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that the OAM
degeneracy of a standard laser cavity may be broken, producing pure OAM modes
as the output, and that generalized vector vortex beams may be created from the
same laser, for example, radially and azimuthally polarized laser beams. It is
noteworthy that all other aspects of the laser cavity follow a standard design,
facilitating easy implementation.

nucleosynthesis of heavy elements by rapid neutron capture (the $r$-process).
Although the location of the abundance peaks near nuclear mass numbers 130 and
195 identify an environment of rapid neutron capture near closed nuclear
shells, the abundances of elements just above and below those peaks are often
underproduced by more than an order of magnitude in model calculations. At the
same time there is a debate in the literature as to what degree the $r$-process
elements are produced in supernovae or the mergers of binary neutron stars. In
this paper we propose a novel solution to both problems. We demonstrate that
the underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks
characteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic
jets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented
via fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a
neutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers. In
this paradigm, the abundance peaks themselves are well reproduced by a
moderately neutron rich, main $r$-process environment such as that encountered
in the magnetohydrodynamical jets in supernovae supplemented with a
high-entropy, weakly neutron rich environment such as that encountered in the
neutrino-driven-wind model to produce the lighter $r$-process isotopes.
Moreover, we show that the relative contributions to the $r$-process abundances
in both the solar-system and metal-poor stars from the weak, main, and
fission-recycling environments required by this proposal are consistent with
estimates of the relative Galactic event rates of core-collapse supernovae for
the weak and main $r$-process and neutron star mergers for the
fission-recycling $r$-process.

fluctuation relations as tautological identities. As in classical dynamics in
contact with a heat bath, time reversal is not unique, and we discuss several
possibilities. For any bistochastic map its dual map preserves the trace and
describes a legitimate dynamics reversed in time, in that case the entropy
production in the environment vanishes. For a generic stochastic map we
construct a simple quantum operation which can be interpreted as a time
reversal. For instance, the decaying channel, which sends the excited state
into the ground state with a certain probability, can be reversed into the
channel transforming the ground state into the excited state with the same
probability.

pattern formation in segregating binary Bose--Einstein condensates in
quasi-two-dimensional systems. Our finite-size-scaling analysis shows that the
percolation threshold of the initial domain pattern emerging from the dynamic
instability is close to 0.5 for strongly repulsive condensates. The percolation
probability is universally described with a scaling function when the
probability is rescaled by the characteristic domain size in the dynamic
scaling regime of the phase-ordering kinetics, independent of the
intercomponent interaction. It is revealed that an infinite domain wall
sandwiched between percolating domains in the two condensates has an noninteger
fractal dimension and keeps the scaling behavior during the dynamic scaling
regime. This result seems to be in contrast to the argument that the dynamic
scale invariance is violated in the presence of an infinite topological defect
in numerical cosmology.

the structural and chemical environment of the junction affects the spin
center. Metrics such as coordination number or symmetry provide a simple method
to quantify the local environment, but neglect the many-body interactions of an
impurity spin when coupled to contacts. Here, we utilize a highly corrugated
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayer to mediate the coupling between a
cobalt spin in CoHx (x=1,2) complexes and the metal contact. While the hydrogen
atoms control the total effective spin, the corrugation is found to smoothly
tune the Kondo exchange interaction between the spin and the underlying metal.
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy together with numerical
simulations, we quantitatively demonstrate how the Kondo exchange interaction
mimics chemical tailoring and changes the magnetic anisotropy.

nearly flat with a very large density of states at the Fermi level. It is
reduced to Fermi arcs upon the symmetry breaking, as expected.

set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations. The dynamic variables
of the network satisfy the canonical commutation relations. Similar large-scale
networks can be found, for example, in quantum metamaterials and optical
lattices. Using spatial Fourier transform techniques, we obtain a sufficient
condition for stability of the network in the case of finite interaction range,
and consider a mean square performance index for the stable network in the
thermodynamic limit. The Peres-Horodecki-Simon separability criterion is
employed in order to obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for quantum
entanglement of bipartite systems of nodes of the network in the Gaussian

formulation, which necessitates the choice of a gauge fixing. Choosing the
Landau gauge, the existing gauge copies are taken into account by means of the
Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) quantization scheme, which entails the introduction of a
dynamical mass scale (Gribov mass) directly influencing the Green functions of
the theory. Here, we determine simultaneously the Polyakov loop (vacuum
expectation value) and Gribov mass in terms of temperature, by minimizing the
vacuum energy w.r.t. the Polyakov loop parameter and solving the Gribov gap
equation. Inspired by the Casimir energy-style of computation, we illustrate
the usage of Zeta function regularization in finite temperature calculations.
Our main result is that the Gribov mass directly feels the deconfinement
transition, visible from a cusp occurring at the same temperature where the
Polyakov loop becomes nonzero. In this exploratory work we mainly restrict
ourselves to the original Gribov-Zwanziger quantization procedure in order to
illustrate the approach and the potential direct link between the vacuum
structure of the theory (dynamical mass scales) and (de)confinement. We also
present a first look at the critical temperature obtained from the Refined
Gribov-Zwanziger approach. Finally, a particular problem for the pressure at
low temperatures is reported.

fundamental in machine learning. This is typically carried out by the Friedman
test. When the Friedman test rejects the null hypothesis, multiple comparisons
are carried out to establish which are the significant differences among
algorithms. The multiple comparisons are usually performed using the mean-ranks
test. The aim of this technical note is to discuss the inconsistencies of the
mean-ranks post-hoc test with the goal of discouraging its use in machine
learning as well as in medicine, psychology, etc.. We show that the outcome of
the mean-ranks test depends on the pool of algorithms originally included in
the experiment. In other words, the outcome of the comparison between
algorithms A and B depends also on the performance of the other algorithms
included in the original experiment. This can lead to paradoxical situations.
For instance the difference between A and B could be declared significant if
the pool comprises algorithms C, D, E and not significant if the pool comprises
algorithms F, G, H. To overcome these issues, we suggest instead to perform the
multiple comparison using a test whose outcome only depends on the two
algorithms being compared, such as the sign-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test.
