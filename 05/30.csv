couples light into the fundamental diffusion mode of a scattering medium. The
total energy density inside a scattering medium of zinc oxide (ZnO)
nanoparticles was probed by measuring the emitted fluorescent power of spheres
that were randomly positioned inside the medium. The fluorescent power of an
optimized incident wave front is observed to be enhanced compared to a
non-optimized incident front. The observed enhancement increases with sample
thickness. Based on diffusion theory, we derive a model wherein the
distribution of energy density of wavefront-shaped light is described by the
fundamental diffusion mode. The agreement between our model and the data is
striking not in the least since there are no adjustable parameters. Enhanced
total energy density is crucial to increase the efficiency of white LEDs, solar
cells, and of random lasers, as well as to realize controlled illumination in
biomedical optics.

recent work on an abstract determinization, these results enable the derivation

Eilenberg-Moore category of a monad. When the monad can be lifted to PMet, we
can equip the final coalgebra with a behavioral distance. The trace distance
between two states of the original coalgebra is the distance between their

Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=39$TeV in the framework of perturbative QCD

found that in heavy-ion collisions at such high colliding energies, both the
rapidity distribution and the transverse momentum spectrum of vector bosons are
considerably suppressed in wide kinematic regions with respect to p+p reactions
due to large nuclear shadowing effect. We demonstrate that in the massive
vector boson productions processes with sea quarks in the initial-state may
give more contributions than those with valence quarks in the initial-state,
therefore in future heavy-ion collisions the isospin effect is less pronounced
and the charge asymmetry of W boson will be reduced significantly as compared
to that at the LHC. Large difference between results with nCTEQ and results
with EPS09 and DSSZ is observed in nuclear modifications of both rapidity and

Based on the hypothesis that they are karstic in origin, we aim at determining
the efficiency of surface dissolution as a landshaping process on Titan, in a
comparative planetology perspective with the Earth as reference. Our approach
is based on the calculation of solutional denudation rates and allow inference
of formation timescales for topographic depressions developed by chemical
erosion on both planetary bodies. The model depends on the solubility of solids
in liquids, the density of solids and liquids, and the average annual net
rainfall rates. We compute and compare the denudation rates of pure solid
organics in liquid hydrocarbons and of minerals in liquid water over Titan and
Earth timescales. We then investigate the denudation rates of a superficial
organic layer in liquid methane over one Titan year. At this timescale, such a
layer on Titan would behave like salts or carbonates on Earth depending on its
composition, which means that dissolution processes would likely occur but
would be 30 times slower on Titan compared to the Earth due to the seasonality
of precipitation. Assuming an average depth of 100 m for Titan's lacustrine
depressions, these could have developed in a few tens of millions of years at
polar latitudes higher than 70{\deg} N and S, and a few hundreds of million
years at lower polar latitudes. The ages determined are consistent with the
youth of the surface (<1 Gyr) and the repartition of dissolution-related
landforms on Titan.

for computing a QR factorization $AP=QR$ where $P$ is a permutation matrix, $Q$
is orthonormal, and $R$ is upper triangular. The algorithm is blocked, to allow
it to be implemented efficiently. The need for single vector pivoting in
classical algorithms for computing QR factorizations is avoided by the use of
randomized sampling to find blocks of pivot vectors at once. The advantage of
blocking becomes particularly pronounced when $A$ is very large, and possibly
stored out-of-core, or on a distributed memory machine. The manuscript also
describes a generalization of the QR factorization that allows $P$ to be a
general orthonormal matrix. In this setting, one can at moderate cost compute a
\textit{rank-revealing} factorization where the mass of $R$ is concentrated to
the diagonal entries. Moreover, the diagonal entries of $R$ closely approximate
the singular values of $A$. The algorithms described have asymptotic flop count
$O(m\,n\,\min(m,n))$, just like classical deterministic methods. The scaling
constant is slightly higher than those of classical techniques, but this is
more than made up for by reduced communication and the ability to block the

The uncertainty concerning the parameters of the imputation model is reflected
using a non-parametric bootstrap. Multiple imputation using MCA (MIMCA)
requires estimating a small number of parameters due to the dimensionality
reduction property of MCA. It allows the user to impute a large range of data
sets. In particular, a high number of categories per variable, a high number of
variables or a small the number of individuals are not an issue for MIMCA.
Through a simulation study based on real data sets, the method is assessed and
compared to the reference methods (multiple imputation using the loglinear
model, multiple imputation by logistic regressions) as well to the latest works
on the topic (multiple imputation by random forests or by the Dirichlet process
mixture of products of multinomial distributions model). The proposed method
shows good performances in terms of bias and coverage for an analysis model

great advantage that it is substantially less time consuming on data sets of
high dimensions than the other multiple imputation methods.

AMIsurvey, used for calibrating and imaging data from the Arcminute Microkelvin
Imager Large Array. AMIsurvey makes use of several component libraries which
have been packaged separately for open-source release. The most scientifically
significant of these is chimenea, which implements a telescope-agnostic
algorithm for automated imaging of pre-calibrated multi-epoch radio-synthesis
data, of the sort typically acquired for transient surveys or follow-up. The
algorithm aims to improve upon standard imaging pipelines by utilizing
iterative RMS-estimation and automated source-detection to avoid so called
`Clean-bias', and makes use of CASA subroutines for the underlying
image-synthesis operations. At a lower level, AMIsurvey relies upon two
libraries, drive-ami and drive-casa, built to allow use of mature
radio-astronomy software packages from within Python scripts. While targeted at
automated imaging, the drive-casa interface can also be used to automate
interaction with any of the CASA subroutines from a generic Python process.
Additionally, these packages may be of wider technical interest beyond
radio-astronomy, since they demonstrate use of the Python library pexpect to
emulate terminal interaction with an external process. This approach allows for
rapid development of a Python interface to any legacy or externally-maintained
pipeline which accepts command-line input, without requiring alterations to the
original code.

principal driver of the disparity. A case is presented that given the expected
mutations from a fluctuating background of astrophysical radiation from such

increase back to a few Ma, before returning to the long-term average rate. This
is a possible explanation for the disparity. One test of this hypothesis is to
look for an acceleration of molecular clocks 2 to 2.5 Ma due to one or more
moderately nearby supernovae known to have happened at that time. Another is to
look for reduced disparity in benthic organisms of the deep ocean. In addition,
due to the importance of highly penetrating muon irradiation, the disparity
should be magnified for megafauna.

of ""Phase Estimation algorithms"" performs when we apply it to solve the
Eigen-Problem of Hermitian matrices. The result is a completely new, efficient
and stable, parallel algorithm to compute an approximate spectral decomposition
of any Hermitian matrix. The algorithm can be implemented by Boolean circuits
in $O(\log^2 n)$ parallel time with a total cost of $O(n^{\omega+1})$ Boolean
operations. This Boolean complexity matches the best known rigorous $O(\log^2
n)$ parallel time algorithms, but unlike those algorithms our algorithm is
(logarithmically) stable, so further improvements may lead to practical
implementations.
  All previous efficient and rigorous approaches to solve the Eigen-Problem use
randomization to avoid bad condition as we do too. Our algorithm makes further
use of randomization in a completely new way, taking random powers of a unitary
matrix to randomize the phases of its eigenvalues. Proving that a tiny Gaussian
perturbation and a random polynomial power are sufficient to ensure almost
pairwise independence of the phases $(\mod (2\pi))$ is the main technical
contribution of this work. This randomization enables us, given a Hermitian
matrix with well separated eigenvalues, to sample a random eigenvalue and
produce an approximate eigenvector in $O(\log^2 n)$ parallel time and
$O(n^\omega)$ Boolean complexity. We conjecture that further improvements of
our method can provide a stable solution to the full approximate spectral
decomposition problem with complexity similar to the complexity (up to a
logarithmic factor) of sampling a single eigenvector.

set. We say that a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is a \emph{Berge}-$G$ if there is a
bijection $f : E(G) \rightarrow E(\mathcal{H})$ such that for $e \in E(G)$ we
have $e \subset f(e)$. This generalizes the established definitions of ""Berge
path"" and ""Berge cycle"" to general graphs. For a fixed graph $G$ we examine the
maximum possible size (i.e.\ the sum of the cardinality of each edge) of a
hypergraph with no Berge-$G$ as a subhypergraph. In the present paper we prove
general bounds for this maximum when $G$ is an arbitrary graph. We also
consider the specific case when $G$ is a complete bipartite graph and prove an
analogue of the K\H ov\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem.

linear transformation have been addressed in this paper. We consider a set of
complex single integrator systems so that the dimension of the system reduces
to half as opposed to the vector representation in Cartesian coordinate system.
We first design a stable formation controller in an attempt to solve the
formation control turned to stabilization problem and then find a collision
avoidance controller in the transformed domain, respectively. Different linear
transformations are used to facilitate the formation control task in a
different way. For example Jacobi transformation is used to separate the shape
control and trajectory control. The inverse of the transformation must have
nonzero eigenvalues with both positive and negative real parts which may lead
the system to instability. If the inverse of the transformation appears in
closed loop then a diagonal stabilizing matrix is required to reassign the
eigenvalues of the inverse of transformation in the right half of complex
plane. The algorithm to find such stabilizing matrix is provided. We then
define a matrix of potential in the actual domain which is the stepping stone
to find a matrix of potential in the transformed domain. Thus collision
avoidance controller can be designed directly in the transformed domain. The
mathematical proof is given that both the actual and transformed system behaves
identically. Simulation results are provided to support our claim.

with any number of consecutive soft particles behave universally in the
multi-soft limit in which all particles go soft simultaneously. After
identifying the diagrams which give the leading contribution we give the
general rules for writing down compact expressions for the multi-soft factor of
m gluons, k of which have negative helicity. We explicitly consider the cases
where k equals 1 and 2. In N =4 SYM, the multi-soft factors of 2 scalars or 2
fermions forming a singlet of SU(4) R-symmetry, and m-2 positive helicity
gluons are derived. The special case of the double-soft limit gives an
amplitude whose leading divergence is 1/\delta^2 and not 1/\delta as in the
case of 2 scalars or 2 fermions that do not form a singlet under SU(4). The
construction based on the analytic supervertices allows us to obtain simple
expressions for the triple-soft limit of 1 scalar and 2 positive helicity
fermions, as well as for the quadrapole-soft limit of 4 positive helicity
fermions, in a singlet configuration.

al. (2014) to realistic galaxy images. This is done by demonstrating the method
on the simulations of the GREAT3 challenge (Mandelbaum et al. 2014b), which
include contributions from anisotropic PSFs. We measure the position angles of
the galaxies using three distinct methods - the integrated light method,
quadrupole moments of surface brightness, and using model-based ellipticity
measurements provided by IM3SHAPE. A weighting scheme is adopted to address
biases in the position angle measurements which arise in the presence of an
anisotropic PSF. Biases on the shear estimates, due to measurement errors on
the position angles and correlations between the measurement errors and the
true position angles, are corrected for using simulated galaxy images and an
iterative procedure. The properties of the simulations are estimated using the
deep field images provided as part of the challenge. A method is developed to
match the distributions of galaxy fluxes and half-light radii from the deep
fields to the corresponding distributions in the field of interest. We recover
angle-only shear estimates with a performance close to current well-established
model and moments-based methods for all three angle measurement techniques. The
Q-values for all three methods are found to be Q~400. The code is freely
available online at http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~mbrown/angle_only_shear/.

elements from a larger set of n elements in d space dimensions so as to
minimize a quadratic criterion, with an special emphasis on applications to
computing the Least Trimmed Squares Estimator (LTSE) for robust regression. The
computation of the LTSE is a challenging subset selection problem involving a
nonlinear program with continuous and binary variables, linked in a highly
nonlinear fashion. The selection of a globally optimal subset using the branch
and bound (BB) algorithm is limited to problems in very low dimension,
tipically d<5, as the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with d.
We introduce a bold pruning strategy in the BB algorithm that results in a
significant reduction in computing time, at the price of a negligeable accuracy
lost. The novelty of our algorithm is that the bounds at nodes of the BB tree
come from pseudo-convexifications derived using a linearization technique with
approximate bounds for the nonlinear terms. The approximate bounds are computed
solving an auxiliary semidefinite optimization problem. We show through a
computational study that our algorithm performs well in a wide set of the most
difficult instances of the LTSE problem.

guaranteed by estimating the amount of leaked information through monitoring
signal disturbance, which, in practice, is generally caused by environmental
noise and device imperfections rather than eavesdropping. Such estimation
therefore tends to overrate the amount of leaked information in practice, leads
to a fundamental threshold of the bit error rate. The threshold becomes a
bottleneck of the development of practical QKD systems. In classical
communication, according to Shannon's communication theory, information can
transform through a noisy channel even if the background noise is very strong
compare to the signal and hence the threshold of the bit error rate tends to
50%. One might wonder whether a QKD scheme can also tolerate error rate as high
as 50%. The question is answered affirmatively with the recent work of
round-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol, which breaks through the
fundamental threshold of the bit error rate and indicates another potential
direction in the field of quantum cryptography. The key challenge to realize
the RRDPS scheme lies on the measurement device, which requires a
variable-delay interferometer. The delay needs to be chosen from a set of
predetermined values randomly. Such measurement can be realized by switching
between many interferometers with different delays at a high speed in
accordance with the system repetition rate. The more delay values can be chosen
from, the higher error rate can be tolerated. By designing an optical system
with multiple switches and employing an active phase stabilization technology,
we successfully construct a variable-delay interferometer with 128 actively
selectable delays. With this measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the
RRDPS QKD protocol and obtain a final key rate of 15.54 bps via a total loss of
18 dB and 8.9% error rate.

the free QFT case. We show that when the ground state of an interacting QFT
evolves under a free massive QFT for a long time (a scenario that can be
realised by a Quantum Quench), the connected correlation functions decay and
all local physical observables equilibrate to values that are given by a
gaussian density matrix that keeps memory only of the two-point initial
correlation function. The argument hinges upon the fundamental physical
principle of cluster decomposition, which is valid for the ground state of a
general QFT. An analogous result was already known to be valid in the case of
d=1 spatial dimensions, where it is a special case of the so-called Generalised
Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) hypothesis, and we now generalise it to higher dimensions.
Moreover in the case of massless free evolution, despite the fact that the
evolution may not lead to equilibration but unbounded increase of correlations
with time instead, the GGE gives correctly the leading order asymptotic
behaviour of correlation functions in the thermodynamic and large time limit.
The demonstration is performed in the context of bosonic relativistic QFT, but
the arguments apply more generally.

i.e., without relative angular momentum. We report measurements of two new

$s$-wave interactions are suppressed by polarising the sample, while $p$-wave
interactions are enhanced by working near a scattering resonance. Using
time-resolved spectroscopy, we study how correlations in the system develop
after ""quenching"" the atoms into an interacting state. Combining
quasi-steady-state measurements with new contact relations, we infer an

dimension of a poset and graph-theoretic properties of its cover graph, we show
that for every $d\geq 1$, if $P$ is a poset and the dimension of a subposet $B$

proof of the upper bound to be fairly elegant and relatively compact. However,
we know of no simple proof for the lower bound, and our argument requires a
powerful tool known as the Product Ramsey Theorem. As a consequence, our
constructions involve posets of enormous size.

linear perturbation analysis, we demonstrate that a spherical dielectric
elastomer balloon may bifurcate to a non-spherical shape under certain

field and stress/stretch distributions, which can lead to the failure of the

balloon in different equilibrium configurations by evaluating its second
variation of free energy under arbitrary perturbations. Our analyses indicate
that under pressure-control and voltage-control mode, non-spherical deformation
of the dielectric elastomer balloon is energetically unstable. However, under
charge-control or ideal gas mass-control mode, non-spherical deformation of the

dwarfs) could allow detailed studies of outflows and possibly accretion flows
in these nearby, numerous and non-relativistic compact accretors. Up to now,
however, very few CVs have been detected in the radio.
  We have conducted a VLA pilot survey of four close and optically-bright
novalike CVs at 6 GHz, detecting three, and thereby doubling the number of
radio detections of these systems. RW Sex, V603 Aql and the old nova TT Ari
were detected in both of the epochs, while V1084 Her was not detected (to a
$3\sigma$ upper-limit of 7.8 $\mu\rm{Jy}\,\rm{beam}^{-1}$). These observations
clearly show that the sensitivity of previous surveys was typically too low to
detect these objects and that non-magnetic CVs can indeed be significant radio
emitters.
  The three detected sources show a range of properties, including flaring and
variability on both short ($\sim$200 s) and longer-term (days) time-scales, as
well as circular polarization levels of up to 100\%. The spectral indices range
from steep to inverted; TT Ari shows a spectral turnover at $\sim$6.5 GHz,
while the spectral index of V603 Aql flattened from $\alpha=0.54\pm0.05$ to
$0.16\pm0.08$ ($F_{\nu}\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) in the week between observations.
This range of properties suggests that more than one emission process can be
responsible for the radio emission in non-magnetic CVs. In this sample we find
that individual systems are consistent with optically thick synchrotron
emission, gyrosynchrotron emission or cyclotron maser emission.

tidally stripped by larger companions. Definitive examples of UCDs formed by
either route have been difficult to find, with only a handful of persuasive
examples of stripped-nucleus type UCDs being known. In this paper we present
very deep Gemini/GMOS spectroscopic observations of the suspected stripped
nucleus UCD NGC 4546-UCD1 taken in good seeing conditions (< 0.7""). With these

this unusual object. We find no evidence of a rise in the central velocity
dispersion of the UCD, suggesting that this UCD lacks a massive central black
hole like those found in some other compact stellar systems, a conclusion
confirmed by detailed dynamical modelling. Finally we are able to use our
extremely high signal to noise spectrum to detect a temporally extended star
formation history for this UCD. We find that the UCD was forming stars since
the earliest epochs until at least 1-2 Gyr ago. Taken together these
observations confirm that NGC 4546-UCD1 is the remnant nucleus of a nucleated

simulations: one including adiabatic gas physics only; the other featuring the
fiducial feedback model of the Illustris simulation. In the adiabatic case, the
magnetic field amplification follows the $B \propto \rho^{2/3}$ scaling derived
from `flux-freezing' arguments, with the seed field strength providing an
overall normalization factor. At high baryon overdensities the amplification is
enhanced by shear flows and turbulence. Feedback physics and the inclusion of
radiative cooling change this picture dramatically. In haloes, gas collapses to
much larger densities and the magnetic field is amplified strongly and to the
same maximum intensity irrespective of the initial seed field of which any
memory is lost. At lower densities a dependence on the seed field strength and
orientation, which in principle can be used to constrain models of cosmic
magnetogenesis, is still present. Inside the most massive haloes magnetic
fields reach values of $\sim 10-100\,\,{\rm \mu G}$, in agreement with galaxy
cluster observations. The topology of the field is tangled and gives rise to
rotation measure signals in reasonable agreement with the observations.
However, the rotation measure signal declines too rapidly towards larger radii

simultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronal
height in a self-consistent manner. Detailed fits to the iron line profile
indicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection from
the inner accretion disk. We find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and a
low source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitational
radii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. In addition, we find that the line
profile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, and
that the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflection
spectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. We find that the blurring
parameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entire

  transform and the back-projection operator represented as convolution
  operators",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Radon transform and its adjoint, the back-projection operator, can both
be expressed as convolutions in log-polar coordinates. Hence, fast algorithms
for the application of the operators can be constructed by using FFT, if data
is resampled at log-polar coordinates. Radon data is typically measured on an
equally spaced grid in polar coordinates, and reconstructions are represented
(as images) in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, in addition to FFT, several
steps of interpolation have to be conducted in order to apply the Radon
transform and the back-projection operator by means of convolutions.
  Both the interpolation and the FFT operations can be efficiently implemented
on Graphical Processor Units (GPUs). For the interpolation, it is possible to
make use of the fact that linear interpolation is hard-wired on GPUs, meaning
that it has the same computational cost as direct memory access. Cubic order
interpolation schemes can be constructed by combining linear interpolation
steps which provides important computation speedup.
  We provide details about how the Radon transform and the back-projection can
be implemented efficiently as convolution operators on GPUs. For large data
sizes, speedups of about 10 times are obtained in relation to the computational
times of other software packages based on GPU implementations of the Radon
transform and the back-projection operator. Moreover, speedups of more than a
1000 times are obtained against the CPU-implementations provided in the MATLAB
image processing toolbox.

sensitive datasets are captured in large graphs. A significant challenge facing

Facebook's social graphs with academic collaborators. Current tools can provide
limited node or edge privacy, but require modifications to the graph that
significantly reduce its utility.
  In this work, we propose a new alternative in the form of graph watermarks.
Graph watermarks are small graphs tailor-made for a given graph dataset, a
secure graph key, and a secure user key. To share a sensitive graph G with a
collaborator C, the owner generates a watermark graph W using G, the graph key,
and C's key as input, and embeds W into G to form G'. If G' is leaked by C,its
owner can reliably determine if the watermark W generated for C does in fact
reside inside G', thereby proving C is responsible for the leak. Graph
watermarks serve both as a deterrent against data leakage and a method of
recourse after a leak. We provide robust schemes for creating, embedding and
extracting watermarks, and use analysis and experiments on large, real graphs
to show that they are unique and difficult to forge. We study the robustness of
graph watermarks against both single and powerful colluding attacker models,
then propose and empirically evaluate mechanisms to dramatically improve

Previous works on stochastic models of human mate choice process indicate that
patterns supporting the matching hypothesis could occur even when similarity is
not the primary consideration in seeking partners. Yet, most if not all of
these works concentrate on fully-connected systems. Here we extend the analysis
to networks. Our results indicate that the correlation of the couple's
attractiveness grows monotonically with the increased average degree and
decreased degree diversity of the network. This correlation is lower in sparse
networks than in fully-connected systems, because in the former less attractive
individuals who find partners are likely to be coupled with ones who are more
attractive than them. The chance of failing to be matched decreases
exponentially with both the attractiveness and the degree. The matching
hypothesis may not hold when the degree-attractiveness correlation is present,
which can give rise to negative attractiveness correlation. Finally, we find
that the ratio between the number of matched couples and the size of the
maximum matching varies non-monotonically with the average degree of the
network. Our results reveal the role of network topology in the process of
human mate choice and bring insights into future investigations of different

number upper bounds in the supremum distance are known for bounded classes that

the classes that arise do not include Lipschitz constraints, and so standard

find upper bounds for bracketing numbers of classes of convex functions without

the consequences of this symmetry in the presence of such extra-dimension. The

disciplines. However, only with the emergence of a digital era, it became
possible to investigate this topic on a larger scale. Over time it became clear
that quality of life not only depends on one, but on three relatively different
parameters: social, economic and well-being measures. In this study we focus
only on the first two, since the last one is often very subjective and
consequently hard to measure. Using a complete set of bank card transactions
recorded by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) during 2011 in Spain, we
first create a feature space by defining various meaningful characteristics of
a particular area performance through activity of its businesses, residents and
visitors. We then evaluate those quantities by considering available official
statistics for Spanish provinces (e.g., housing prices, unemployment rate, life
expectancy) and investigate whether they can be predicted based on our feature
space. For the purpose of prediction, our study proposes a supervised machine
learning approach. Our finding is that there is a clear correlation between
individual spending behavior and official socioeconomic indexes denoting
quality of life. Moreover, we believe that this modus operandi is useful to
understand, predict and analyze the impact of human activity on the wellness of
our society on scales for which there is no consistent official statistics
available (e.g., cities and towns, districts or smaller neighborhoods).

captured during the evolution of the solar system. Knowing their physical
parameters, such as size, density, and albedo is important for constraining
where they came from and how they were captured. The best way to obtain these
parameters are observations in situ by spacecrafts or from stellar occultations
by the objects. Both techniques demand that the orbits are well known. We aimed
to obtain good astrometric positions of irregular satellites to improve their
orbits and ephemeris. We identified and reduced observations of several
irregular satellites from three databases containing more than 8000 images
obtained between 1992 and 2014 at three sites (Observat\'orio do Pico dos Dias,
Observatoire de Haute-Provence, and European Southern Observatory - La Silla).
We used the software PRAIA (Platform for Reduction of Astronomical Images
Automatically) to make the astrometric reduction of the CCD frames. The UCAC4
catalog represented the International Celestial Reference System in the
reductions. Identification of the satellites in the frames was done through
their ephemerides as determined from the SPICE/NAIF kernels. Some procedures
were followed to overcome missing or incomplete information (coordinates,
date), mostly for the older images. We managed to obtain more than 6000
positions for 18 irregular satellites: 12 of Jupiter, 4 of Saturn, 1 of Uranus
(Sycorax), and 1 of Neptune (Nereid). For some satellites the number of
obtained positions is more than 50\% of what was used in earlier orbital
numerical integrations. Comparison of our positions with recent JPL ephemeris
suggests there are systematic errors in the orbits for some of the irregular
satellites. The most evident case was an error in the inclination of Carme.

to absolute latitudes $10^o<|b| <70^o$. From a fit to the LAT data including
atomic, molecular and ionized hydrogen column density templates as well as a
dust optical depth map we derived the emissivities, the molecular hydrogen to
CO conversion factor $X_{CO}=(0.902\pm0.007) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km
s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ and the dust-to-gas ratio $X_{DUST}=(41.4\pm0.3) \times

$\gamma$-ray emission from ionized hydrogen. We compared the extracted
emissivities to those calculated from $\gamma$-ray production cross-sections
and to CR spectra measured in the heliosphere. We observed that the
experimental emissivities are reproduced only if the solar modulation is
accounted for. This provides a direct detection of solar modulation observed
previously through the anticorrelation between CR fluxes and solar activity.
Finally we fitted a parametrized spectral form to the heliospheric CR
observations as well as to the {\it Fermi}-LAT emissivity and obtained
compatible local interstellar spectra for proton and Helium kinetic energy per

sequence-function relationships -- functions that map the sequence of DNA, RNA,
or protein to a biochemically relevant activity. Most sequence-function
relationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental
techniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The
advent of such ""massively parallel"" experiments presents an exciting
opportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the
study of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental
advances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of
sequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments.
Specifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that
inference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based
approach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these
models. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of ""diffeomorphic
modes"" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data
than likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in
physics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the
inference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel
experiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these
fundamental aspects of statistical inference. This paper concludes with an
outlook on the theoretical and computational challenges currently facing
studies of quantitative sequence-function relationships.

than 1% for continuum sources and exoplanets, alike. The paper concludes by
describing a new approach to expanding this survey to many more targets and
much greater sensitivity using archived data from interferometers all over the

  dissipative perturbations of Hamiltonian systems",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems in Physics are described by dynamical systems that are
conformally symplectic (e.g., mechanical systems with a friction proportional
to the velocity, variational problems with a small discount or thermostated
systems). Conformally symplectic systems are characterized by the property that
they transform a symplectic form into a multiple of itself. The limit of small
dissipation, which is the object of the present study, is particularly
interesting.
  We provide all details for maps, but we present also the modifications needed
to obtain a direct proof for the case of differential equations. We consider a
family of conformally symplectic maps $f_{\mu, \epsilon}$ defined on a
$2d$-dimensional symplectic manifold $\mathcal M$ with exact symplectic form
$\Omega$; we assume that $f_{\mu,\epsilon}$ satisfies
$f_{\mu,\epsilon}^*\Omega=\lambda(\epsilon) \Omega$. We assume that the family
depends on a $d$-dimensional parameter $\mu$ (called drift) and also on a small
scalar parameter $\epsilon$. Furthermore, we assume that the conformal factor
$\lambda$ depends on $\epsilon$, in such a way that for $\epsilon=0$ we have
$\lambda(0)=1$ (the symplectic case).
  We study the domains of analyticity in $\epsilon$ near $\epsilon=0$ of
perturbative expansions (Lindstedt series) of the parameterization of the
quasi--periodic orbits of frequency $\omega$ (assumed to be Diophantine) and of
the parameter $\mu$. Notice that this is a singular perturbation, since any
friction (no matter how small) reduces the set of quasi-periodic solutions in
the system. We prove that the Lindstedt series are analytic in a domain in the
complex $\epsilon$ plane, which is obtained by taking from a ball centered at
zero a sequence of smaller balls with center along smooth lines going through
the origin. The radii of the excluded balls decrease faster than any power of
the distance of the center to the origin.

possibility, where in the transition region both order parameters would be
present and time reversal symmetry would be broken. We report specific heat in
magnetic fields down to 0.4 K of three single crystals, free of low temperature
magnetic anomalies, of heavily overdoped Ba1-xKxFe2As2, x= 0.91, 0.88, and
0.81, Tc(mid) ~ 5.6, 7.2 and 13 K and Hc2 ~ 4.5, 6, and 20 T respectively. The

dependence of gamma (=C/T as T->0) showing an S-shape vs H, with the
suppression of the lower gap by 1 T and gamma ~ H**1/2 overall. Although such a
non-linear gamma vs H is consistent with deep minima or nodes in the gap, it is
not clear evidence for one, or both, of the gaps being nodal. Following the
established analysis of the specific heat of d-wave cuprate superconductors
containing line nodes, we present the specific heat/H**1/2 vs T/H**1/2 of these
Ba1-xKxFe2As2 samples which all, due to the absence of magnetic impurities,
convincingly show the scaling for line node behavior for the larger gap. There
is however no clear observation of the nodal behavior C ~ alpha*T**2 in zero
field at low temperatures, with alpha ~ 2 mJ/molK**3 being consistent with the
data. This, with the scaling, leaves the possibility of extreme anisotropy in a
nodeless larger gap, Delta2, such that the scaling works for fields above 0.25
to 0.5 T (0.2 to 0.4 K in temperature units), where this an estimate for the
size of the deep minima in the Delta2 ~ 20-25 K gap. Thus, the change from
nodeless to nodal gaps in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 may be closer to the KFe2As2 endpoint

with three stages for multiphase segmentation of color images corrupted by
different degradations: noise, information loss, and blur. At the first stage,
a convex variant of the Mumford-Shah model is applied to each channel to obtain
a smooth image. We show that the model has unique solution under the different
degradations. In order to properly handle the color information, the second
stage is dimension lifting where we consider a new vector-valued image composed
of the restored image and its transform in the secondary color space with
additional information. This ensures that even if the first color space has
highly correlated channels, we can still have enough information to give good
segmentation results. In the last stage, we apply multichannel thresholding to
the combined vector-valued image to find the segmentation. The number of phases
is only required in the last stage, so users can choose or change it all
without the need of solving the previous stages again. Experiments demonstrate
that our SLaT method gives excellent results in terms of segmentation quality
and CPU time in comparison with other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

electronegativity of Tl, in conjunction with its oxidation state, explains the
higher {\sigma} and Tc0 values in the Tl-based compounds relative to their

power law dependence with respect to the number of residues, $\tau_{CF} \sim
N^{\alpha}$. Fluorescence quenching measurements based on triplet-triplet
energy transfer show variation in the value of scaling exponent $\alpha$ for
different protein-solvent systems. Here, starting from a non-Markovian
diffusion equation supplemented with an exponential sink term that accounts for
the energy transfer reaction between donor and acceptor groups, we calculate
the mean time of contact formation using the Wilemski-Fixman closure
approximation. The non-Markovian diffusion-reaction equation includes the
effects of solvent quality and hydrodynamic interaction in a mean-field
fashion. It shows that the contact formation dynamics is mainly governed by two
time scales, the reciprocal of the intrinsic rate of quenching
$(k_0^{ET})^{-1}$, and the relaxation time $\tau_0 = \eta b^3/k_B T$ of the
coarse-grained residue of an effective size $b$ with solvent viscosity $\eta$.
In the limit of $k_0^{ET} \tau_0 \ll 1$, the dominating effect of the
reaction-controlled kinetics yields the scaling exponents as $0.89$, $1.47$ and
$1.79$ in poor, theta and good solvents respectively. In the opposite limit
$k_0^{ET} \tau_0 \gg 1$, the dominating influence of the diffusion-controlled
kinetics results in $\alpha$ as $1.90$, $2.17$, $2.36$ for a freely-draining

good solvents respectively. In the intermediate limit, $k_0^{ET} \tau_0 \approx
1$, the increase in the number of residues switches the kinetics from
reaction-controlled at low $N$ to diffusion-controlled at large $N$. These
general results suggest that experimental estimates of the scaling exponents
reflect solvent-quality dependence of the mean contact formation time in the

scaled-down) tunneling field-effect-transistors (TFETs) based on homojunction
direct-bandgap semiconductors. The model is based on an analytic description of
two key features, which capture the main physical phenomena related to TFETs:
1) the potential profile from source to channel, and 2) the elliptic curvature
of the complex bands in the bandgap region. It is proposed to use 1D Poisson's
equations in the source and the channel to describe the potential profile in
homojunction TFETs. This allows to quantify the impact of source/drain doping
on device performance, an aspect usually ignored in TFET modeling but highly
relevant in ultra-scaled devices. The compact model is validated by comparison
with state-of-the-art quantum transport simulations using a 3D full band
atomistic approach based on Non-Equilibrium Green's Functions (NEGF). It is
shown that the model reproduces with good accuracy the data obtained from the
simulations in all regions of operation: the on/off states and the n/p branches
of conduction. This approach allows calculation of energy-dependent band-toband
tunneling currents in TFETs, a feature that allows gaining deep insights into
the underlying device physics. The simplicity and accuracy of the approach
provides a powerful tool to explore in a quantitatively manner how a wide
variety of parameters (material-, size- and/or geometrydependent) impact the
TFET performance under any bias conditions. The proposed model presents thus a
practical complement to computationally expensive simulations such as the 3D

constrain cosmological parameters. Forecasts of these surveys' effectiveness
typically assume Gaussian statistics for the underlying matter density, despite
the fact that the actual distribution is decidedly non-Gaussian. To quantify
the effect of this assumption, we employ an analytic expression for the power
spectrum covariance matrix to calculate the Fisher information for BAO-type
model surveys. We find that for typical number densities, at $k_\mathrm{max} =
0.5 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, Gaussian assumptions significantly overestimate the
information on all parameters considered, in some cases by up to an order of
magnitude. However, after marginalizing over a six-parameter set, the form of
the covariance matrix (dictated by $N$-body simulations) causes the majority of
the effect to shift to the ""amplitude-like"" parameters, leaving the others
virtually unaffected. We find that Gaussian assumptions at such wavenumbers can
underestimate the dark energy parameter errors by well over 50 per cent,
producing dark energy figures of merit almost 3 times too large. Thus, for 3D
galaxy surveys probing the non-linear regime, proper consideration of
non-Gaussian effects is essential.

time, is proposed and the motion of such a tired random walker is studied
systematically in one, two and three dimensional contin- uum. In all cases, the
diffusive nature of walker, breaks down due to tiring which is quite obvious.
In one dimension, the distribution of the displace- ment of a tired walker
remains Gaussian (as observed in normal walker) with reduced width. In two and
three dimensions, the probability distribution of displacement becomes
nonmonotonic and unimodal. The most probable displacement and the deviation
reduces as the tiring factor increases. The probability of return of a tired
walker, decreases as the tiring factor increases in one and two dimensions.
However, in three dimensions, it is found that the probability of return almost
insensitive to the tiring factor. The prob- ability distributions of first
return time of a tired random walker do not show the scale invariance as
observed for a normal walker in continuum. The exponents, of such power law
distributions of first return time, in all three dimensions are estimated for

statistics and computational science. Clustering of nodes in wireless sensor
networks which is used to prolong the life-time of networks is one of the
difficult tasks of clustering procedure. In order to perform nodes clustering,
a number of nodes are determined as cluster heads and other ones are joined to
one of these heads, based on different criteria e.g. Euclidean distance. So
far, different approaches have been proposed for this process, where swarm and
evolutionary algorithms contribute in this regard. In this study, a novel
algorithm is proposed based on Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) for
clustering procedure. In the proposed method, the performance of the standard
AFSA is improved by increasing balance between local and global searches.
Furthermore, a new mechanism has been added to the base algorithm for improving
convergence speed in clustering problems. Performance of the proposed technique
is compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques in this field and the
outcomes indicate the supremacy of the proposed technique.

Crystallization of A-polymer precedes the crystallization of B-polymer upon
cooling from a homogeneous melt. The morphological development is controlled by
the interplay between crystallization and macrophase separation. With
increasing segregation strength, smaller and thinner crystals form with lesser
crystallinity. During the process, A-polymer crystallizes first followed by the
crystallization of B-polymer in the presence of already crystalline domains
A-polymer. Thus, crystallization of B-polymer slows down influencing overall
crystal morphology. With increasing segregation strength between two polymers,
we observe a decreasing trend in mean square radius of gyration, reflecting the
increased repulsive interaction between them. As a consequence, a large number
of smaller size crystals form with lesser crystallinity. Isothermal
crystallization reveals that the transition pathways strongly depend on
segregation strength. We also observe a path-dependent crystallization behavior
in isothermal crystallization: two-step (sequential) isothermal crystallization
yields superior crystalline structure in both A- and B-polymers than one-step
(coincident).

(i) The RGB and the subgiant branch (SGB) number ratios show that the

an irreconcilable difference can be seen in the rather simple two horizontal
branch (HB) classification by other. (ii) Each group has its own CN-CH

illusive. (iii) The location of the RGB bump of the calcium-strong (Ca-s) group
is significantly fainter, which may pose a challenge to the helium enhancement

The Ca-w group is slightly more centrally concentrated, while the the Ca-s is
more elongated at larger radii. (vi) The mean radial velocities for both groups

that it formed via a merger of two GCs in a dwarf galaxy environment and

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Over a time window of approximately
25 fs after absorption of the pump pulse, we observe an increase in conduction
band carrier density and a simultaneous decrease of the average carrier kinetic
energy, revealing that relaxation is in fact dominated by inverse Auger
scattering. Measurements of carrier scattering at extreme timescales by
photoemission will serve as a guide to ultrafast control of electronic
properties in solids for PetaHertz electronics.

considerable attention and research. Recently, Wu, Zhang and Li introduced the
concept of equitable $(t,k)$-tree-coloring, which can be regarded as a
generalization of proper equitable $t$-coloring. The \emph{strong equitable
vertex $k$-arboricity} of $G$, denoted by ${va_k}^\equiv(G)$, is the smallest
integer $t$ such that $G$ has an equitable $(t', k)$-tree-coloring for every
$t'\geq t$. The exact value of strong equitable vertex $k$-arboricity of
complete equipartition bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ was studied by Wu, Zhang and
Li. In this paper, we first get a sharp upper bound of strong equitable vertex
arboricity of complete bipartite graph$K_{n,n+\ell} \ (1\leq \ell\leq n)$, that
is,
${va_2}^\equiv(K_{n,n+\ell})\leq2\left\lfloor{\frac{n+\ell+1}{3}}\right\rfloor$.
Next, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition on an equitable
$(q,\infty)$-tree coloring of a complete equipartition tripartite graph, and
study the strong equitable vertex arboricity of forests. For a simple graph $G$
of order $n$, we show that $1\leq {va_k}^\equiv(G)\leq \lceil n/2 \rceil$.
Furthermore, graphs with
${va_k}^\equiv(G)=1,\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil,\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil-1$ are
characterized, respectively. In the end, we obtain the Nordhaus-Gaddum type
results of strong equitable vertex $k$-arboricity for general $k$.

""quantization"" of fully coupled neural networks like the Hopfield model. The
idea is to replace the classical irreversible attractor dynamics driven by an
Ising model with pattern-dependent weights by the reversible rotation of an
input quantum state onto an output quantum state consisting of a linear
superposition with probability amplitudes peaked on the stored pattern closest
to the input in Hamming distance, resulting in a high probability of measuring
a memory pattern very similar to the input. The unitary operator implementing
this transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit
elementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum
Ising model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions,
exactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use
of postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the
famed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they
permit to completely {\it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories}. The
number of control qubits plays the role of an inverse fictitious temperature,
the accuracy of pattern retrieval can be tuned by lowering the fictitious
temperature under a critical value for quantum content association while the
complexity of the retrieval algorithm remains polynomial for any number of
patterns polynomial in the number of qubits. These models solve thus the
capacity shortage problem of classical associative memories, providing a {\it
polynomial improvement} in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic
nature of information retrieval.
