problem arising in current quantum technology applications. A key example is
the tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state
preparation in ion trap experiments \cite{Haffner2005}. Since full tomography
becomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to
investigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior
information about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such
models. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient
estimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist
in first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to
an appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues
below a certain ""noise level"" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or
normalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the
space dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as
$r\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert
space, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples. Furthermore we establish a
lower bound for the asymptotic minimax risk which shows that the above scaling
is optimal. The performance of the estimators is analysed in an extensive
simulations study, with emphasis on the dependence on the state rank, and the
number of measurement repetitions. We find that all estimators perform
significantly better that the least squares, with the ""physical estimator""
(which is a bona fide density matrix) slightly outperforming the other
estimators.

While it is conceivable that low-oxygen-adapted animals evolved only sometime
during the past 541 million years, perhaps in response to oceanic anoxic
events, they most reasonably date back to the first animals themselves, as the
last common ancestor of animals likely emerged in a relatively low-oxygen

that the broadband X-ray spectrum is remarkably similar to that observed in the
so-called `hypersoft' state of the high mass X-ray binary Cyg X-3, which
possesses a strong stellar wind from a Wolf-Rayet secondary. The power-spectral
density (PSD) of GRO J1655-40 shows a bending power-law shape, similar to that
of canonical soft states albeit with larger fractional rms. However, the
characteristic bend-frequency of the PSD is strongly correlated with the X-ray
flux, such that the bend-frequency increases by two decades for less than a
factor 2 increase in flux. The strong evolution of PSD bend-frequency for very
little change in flux or X-ray spectral shape seems to rule out the suppression
of high-frequency variability by scattering in the wind as the origin of the
PSD bend. Instead, we suggest that the PSD shape is intrinsic to the
variability process and may be linked to the evolution of the scale-height in a
slim disc. An alternative possibility is that variability is introduced by
variable absorption and scattering in the wind. We further argue that the

etiologies. While current research interests have shifted toward uncovering
rare variants and structural variations predisposing to human diseases, the
impact of heterogeneity in genetic studies of complex diseases has been largely
overlooked. Most of the existing statistical methods assume the disease under
investigation has a homogeneous genetic effect and could, therefore, have low
power if the disease undergoes heterogeneous pathophysiological and etiological
processes. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method
for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied
to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is
computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through
simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic
etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU
against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions). Using HWU,
we conducted a genome-wide analysis of nicotine dependence from the Study of
Addiction: Genetics and Environments (SAGE) dataset. The genome-wide analysis
of nearly one million genetic markers took 7 hours, identifying heterogeneous

near-ultraviolet through the optical (F275W, F336W, F438W, F555W, and F814W).
The apparent brightness of the echo at the time was ~21--22 mag in all of these
bands. The echo appears circular, although less obviously as a ring, with an
inhomogeneous surface brightness, in particular, a prominent enhanced
brightness to the southeast. The SN itself was still detectable, particularly
in the redder bands. We are able to model the light echo as the time-integrated
SN light scattered off of diffuse interstellar dust in the SN environment. We
have assumed that this dust is analogous to that in the Milky Way with R_V=3.1.
The SN light curves that we consider also include models of the unobserved
early burst of light from the SN shock breakout. Our analysis of the echo

is consistent with estimates made previously from the SN itself. Finally, our

effect observed in the solar corona and slow-speed wind, and in the coronae of
solar-like dwarf stars, and the ""inverse FIP"" effect seen in the corona of
stars of later spectral type; specifically M dwarfs. These effects relate to
the enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect
to photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV. They are
interpreted in terms of the ponderomotive force due to the propagation and/or
reflection of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the chromosphere. This acts on
chromospheric ions, but not neutrals, and so can lead to ion-neutral
fractionation.
  A detailed description of the model applied to closed magnetic loops, and to
open field regions is given, accounting for the observed difference in solar
FIP fractionation between the slow and fast wind. It is shown that such a model
can also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind. The
helium depletion is sensitive to the chromospheric altitude where ion-neutral
separation occurs, and the behavior of the helium abundance in the closed
magnetic loop strongly suggests that the waves have a coronal origin. This, and
other similar inferences may be expected to have a strong bearing on theories
of solar coronal heating.

mainly to fast mode waves, can also give rise to ion-neutral separation.
Depending on the geometry of the magnetic field, this can result in FIP or
Inverse FIP effects. We argue that such configurations are more likely to occur
in later-type stars (known to have stronger field in any case), and that this
explains the occurrence of the Inverse FIP effect in M dwarfs.

allocation equal to the weight of their bid divided by the sum of weights of
all bids, where each bid's weight is determined by a weight function. We study
the relationship between the weight function, bidders' private values, number
of bidders, and the seller's revenue in equilibrium. It has been shown that if
one bidder has a much higher private value than the others, then a nearly flat
weight function maximizes revenue. Essentially, threatening the bidder who has
the highest valuation with having to share the allocation maximizes the
revenue. We show that as bidder private values approach parity, steeper weight
functions maximize revenue by making the quasi-proportional auction more like a
winner-take-all auction. We also show that steeper weight functions maximize
revenue as the number of bidders increases. For flatter weight functions, there
is known to be a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. We show that a
pure-strategy Nash equilibrium also exists for steeper weight functions, and we
give lower bounds for bids at an equilibrium. For a special case that includes
the two-bidder auction, we show that the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is
unique, and we show how to compute the revenue at equilibrium. We also show
that selecting a weight function based on private value ratios and number of

Lame parameters in semi-infinite, three-dimensional, arbitrarily heterogeneous
formations, using surficial measurements of the soil's response to probing
elastic waves. We use the complete waveform response of the medium to derive
the inverse problem, by using a partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained
optimization approach, directly in the time-domain, to minimize the misfit
between the observed response of the medium at select measurement locations,
and a computed response corresponding to a trial distribution of the Lame
parameters. We discuss strategies that lend algorithmic robustness to our
proposed inversion scheme. To limit the computational domain to the size of
interest, we employ perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs).
  In order to resolve the forward problem, we use a recently developed hybrid
finite element approach, where a displacement-stress formulation for the PML is
coupled to a standard displacement-only formulation for the interior domain,
thus leading to a computationally cost-efficient scheme. Time-integration is
accomplished by using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, which is well-suited for
large-scale problems on parallel computers.

gradients in 1D, 2D, and 3D that arise as the results of optical design
techniques such as thin film optimization methods, transformation optics and
conformal mapping. Refractive index optimized multi-layer anti-reflection
coatings on crystalline silicon, which reduce light reflections from 38% down
to ~3% with a wide angular span, are demonstrated with the developed wet
processing route. A high temperature oxygen free fiber optic hydrogen sensor
realized by accessing nano-engineering enabled refractive indices is also
presented. The functionality of the sensor is characterized with a fiber Bragg
grating, transmission based interrogation, and optical frequency domain
reflectometry. The latter demonstrates the potential of the developed sensor
for the detection of chemical gradients for applications such as in high
temperature hydrogen driven fuel cells.

major problem in epidemiology, demography, and public health research.
Capture-recapture and multiplier methods have become standard tools for
inference of hidden population sizes, but they require independent random
sampling of target population members, which is rarely possible.
Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a survey method for hidden populations that
relies on social link tracing. The RDS recruitment process is designed to
spread through the social network connecting members of the target population.
In this paper, we show how to use network data revealed by RDS to estimate
hidden population size. The key insight is that the recruitment chain, timing
of recruitments, and network degrees of recruited subjects provide information
about the number of individuals belonging to the target population who are not
yet in the sample. We use a computationally efficient Bayesian method to
integrate over the missing edges in the subgraph of recruited individuals. We
validate the method using simulated data and apply the technique to estimate
the number of people who inject drugs in St. Petersburg, Russia.

reachability($st$-Reachability), single source reachability(SSR) and strongly

we design a randomized algorithm that maintains with high probability:
  1) $st$-Reachability in $\tilde{O}(mn^{4/5})$ total update time. 2)
$st$-Reachability in a total update time of $\tilde{O}(n^{8/3})$ in a dense

total update time of $\tilde{O}(m n^{9/10})$. For all the above problems, we
improve upon the previous best algorithm (by Henzinger et. al. (STOC 2014)).
  Our main focus is maintaining $st$-Reachability in an edge decremental
directed graph (other problems can be reduced to $st$-Reachability). The
classical algorithm of Even and Shiloach (JACM 81) solved this problem in
$O(1)$ query time and $O(mn)$ total update time. Recently, Henzinger,
Krinninger and Nanongkai (STOC 2014) designed a randomized algorithm which
achieves an update time of $\tilde{O}(m n^{0.98})$ and broke the long-standing
$O(mn)$ bound of Even and Shiloach. However, they designed four algorithms $A_i
(1\le i \le 4)$ such that for graphs having total number of edges between $m_i$
and $m_{i+1}$ ($m_{i+1} > m_i$), $A_i$ outperforms other three algorithms. That
is, one of the four algorithms may be faster for a particular density range of
edges, but it may be too slow asymptotically for the other ranges. Our main
contribution is that we design a {\it single} algorithm which works for all
types of graphs. Not only is our algorithm faster, it is much simpler than the
algorithm designed by Henzinger et.al. (STOC 2014).

outsourcing, computation delegation, cloud computing. In these applications,
the verifier may pay the prover based on the quality of his work. Rational
interactive proofs (RIP), introduced by Azar and Micali (2012), are an
interactive-proof system with payments, in which the prover is rational rather
than untrustworthy---he may lie, but only to increase his payment. Rational
proofs leverage the provers' rationality to obtain simple and efficient
protocols. Azar and Micali show that RIP=IP(=PSAPCE). They leave the question
of whether multiple provers are more powerful than a single prover for rational
and classical proofs as an open problem.
  In this paper, we introduce multi-prover rational interactive proofs (MRIP).
Here, a verifier cross-checks the provers' answers with each other and pays
them according to the messages exchanged. The provers are cooperative and
maximize their total expected payment if and only if the verifier learns the
correct answer to the problem. We further refine the model of MRIP to
incorporate utility gap, which is the loss in payment suffered by provers who
mislead the verifier to the wrong answer.
  We define the class of MRIP protocols with constant, noticeable and
negligible utility gaps. We give tight characterization for all three MRIP
classes. We show that under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, MRIP is
more powerful than both RIP and MIP ; and this is true even the utility gap is
required to be constant. Furthermore the full power of each MRIP class can be
achieved using only two provers and three rounds. (A preliminary version of

address the transitions between all those phases of quantum matter under the
same framework, we introduced an analogous yet very simple picture for phase
transitions in the context of tensor-networks. Using a very simple iteration
process, we found that both symmetry breaking and some topological phase
transitions (for topological orders described by gauge theory and 1D SPT
orders) could be marked by a sudden change in the symmetry structure of the
so-called ""environment matrix"". In this process, the environment matrix serves
as an ""order parameter"" that captures patterns of entanglement in topological
phases. The symmetry change in the environment matrix is very much like the
symmetry breaking of conventional order parameters. We applied this method to
both the transverse Ising model (1D and 2D honeycomb), spin-1 model (1D), and
the Toric Code model in a magnetic field (2D honeycomb), and explored the

we introduce social dilemmas with informed strategies, and we show that this
gives rise to two cyclically dominant triplets that form defensive alliances.
The stability of these two alliances is determined by the rotation velocity of
the strategies within each triplet. A weaker strategy in a faster rotating
triplet can thus overcome an individually stronger competitor. Fascinating
spatial patterns favor the dominance of a single defensive alliance, but enable
also the stable coexistence of both defensive alliances in very narrow regions
of the parameter space. A continuous reentrant phase transition reveals before

cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution, since their most intense

unique data sets to probe this both at low and high redshifts. The AKARI
performed all sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160$\mu$m) with
3-10 times better sensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR
wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission. Combined with a better
spatial resolution, AKARI can much more precisely measure the total infrared
luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared
luminosity density of the local Universe. In the AKARI NEP deep field, we
construct restframe 8$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m, and total infrared (TIR) luminosity
functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2 using 4128 infrared sources. A continuous
filter coverage in the mid-IR wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and

which was the largest uncertainty in previous work. By combining these two
results, we reveal dust-hidden cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution

X-ray light curves of accreting black hole and neutron star binaries have the
potential to be powerful diagnostics of strong field gravity. However, this
potential cannot be fulfilled without a working theoretical model, which has
remained elusive. Perhaps the most promising model associates the QPO with
Lense-Thirring precession of the inner accretion flow, with the changes in
viewing angle and Doppler boosting modulating the flux over the course of a
precession cycle. Here, we consider the polarization signature of a precessing
inner accretion flow. We use simple assumptions about the Comptonization
process generating the emitted spectrum and take all relativistic effects into
account, parallel transporting polarization vectors towards the observer along
null geodesics in the Kerr metric. We find that both the degree of linear
polarization and the polarization angle should be modulated on the QPO
frequency. We calculate the predicted absolute rms variability amplitude of the
polarization degree and angle for a specific model geometry. We find that it
should be possible to detect these modulations for a reasonable fraction of
parameter space with a future X-ray polarimeter such as NASA's Polarization

correcting for contamination effects and having performed the appropriate
reliability tests. The most reliable binary fractions are obtained when
restricting the binary fraction to q > 0.5. Our analysis indicates that the
range of the binary fractions is nearly an order of magnitude for the lowest
dynamical ages, suggesting that there is a broad distribution in the binary
fraction at globular cluster formation. Dynamical effects also appears to
decrease the core binary fractions by a factor of two over a Hubble time, but
this is a weak relationship. We confirm a correlation from previous work that
the binary fraction within the core radius decreases with cluster age,
indicating that younger clusters formed with higher binary fractions. The
strong radial gradient in the binary fraction with cluster radius appears to be
a consequence of dynamical interactions. It is often not present in dynamically
young clusters but nearly always present in dynamically old clusters.

(PRM) and the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms, represent one of
the most successful approaches to robotic motion planning, due to their strong
theoretical properties (in terms of probabilistic completeness or even
asymptotic optimality) and remarkable practical performance. Such algorithms
are probabilistic in that they compute a path by connecting independently and
identically distributed random points in the configuration space. Their
randomization aspect, however, makes several tasks challenging, including
certification for safety-critical applications and use of offline computation
to improve real-time execution. Hence, an important open question is whether
similar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be
obtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random sampling sequences.
The objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question.
Specifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning
parameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is
deterministically asymptotically optimal. Second, we characterize the
convergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very
explicitly upper-bounded in terms of the l2-dispersion of the sampling sequence
and the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal
version of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close
to O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the
sequence. This is in stark contrast to the O(n logn) complexity results for
existing asymptotically-optimal probabilistic planners. Finally, through
numerical experiments, we show that planning with deterministic low-dispersion
sampling generally provides superior performance in terms of path cost and
success rate.

Type Ia supernovae. However, the dynamics of these flames is still not
well-understood. RT unstable flames are affected by both the RT instability of
the flame front and by RT-generated turbulence. The coexistence of these
factors complicates the choice of flame speed subgrid models for full-star Type
Ia simulations. Both processes can stretch and wrinkle the flame surface,
increasing its area and, therefore, the burning rate. In past research, subgrid
models have been based on either the RT instability or turbulence setting the
flame speed. We evaluate both models, checking their assumptions and their
ability to correctly predict the turbulent flame speed. Specifically, we
analyze a large parameter study of 3D direct numerical simulations of RT
unstable model flames. This study varies both the simulation domain width and
the gravity in order to probe a wide range of flame behaviors. We show that RT
unstable flames are different from traditional turbulent flames: they are
thinner, rather than thicker when turbulence is stronger. We also show that
none of several different types of turbulent flame speed models accurately
predicts measured flame speeds. In addition, we find that the RT flame speed
model only correctly predicts the measured flame speed in a certain parameter
regime. Finally, we propose that the formation of cusps may be the factor
causing the flame to propagate more quickly than predicted by the RT model.

the spin-s representation of SU(2). We characterize the ""uncertainty regions''
given by all vectors, whose components are specified by the variances of the
three angular momentum components. A basic feature of this set is a lower bound
for the sum of the three variances. We give a method for obtaining optimal
lower bounds for uncertainty regions for general operator triples, and evaluate
these for small s. Further lower bounds are derived by generalizing the
technique by which Robertson obtained his state-dependent lower bound. These
are optimal for large s, since they are saturated by states taken from the
Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that, for all s, all variances are
consistent with the so-called vector model, i.e., they can also be realized by
a classical probability measure on a sphere of radius sqrt(s(s+1)). Entropic
uncertainty relations can be discussed similarly, but are minimized by
different states than those minimizing the variances for small s. For large s
the Maassen-Uffink bound becomes sharp and we explicitly describe the
extremalizing states. Measurement uncertainty, as recently discussed by Busch,
Lahti and Werner for position and momentum, is introduced and a generalized
observable (POVM) which minimizes the worst case measurement uncertainty of all
angular momentum components is explicitly determined, along with the minimal
uncertainty. The output vectors for the optimal measurement all have the same
length r(s), where r(s)/s goes to 1 as s tends to infinity.

neuroavalanches, gamma-ray bursts, solar flares \emph{etc}. that exhibit
scale-free statistics much in the spirit of the logarithmic Ritcher scale for
earthquake magnitudes. On phase diagrams, stochastic dynamical systems (DSs)
exhibiting this type of dynamics belong to the finite-width phase (N-phase for
brevity) that precedes ordinary chaotic behavior and that is known under such
names as noise-induced chaos, self-organized criticality, dynamical complexity
\emph{etc.} Within the recently formulated approximation-free supersymemtric
theory of stochastics, the N-phase can be roughly interpreted as the
noise-induced ""overlap"" between integrable and chaotic deterministic dynamics.
As a result, the N-phase dynamics inherits the properties of the both. Here, we
analyze this unique set of properties and conclude that the N-phase DSs must
naturally be the most efficient optimizers: on one hand, N-phase DSs have
integrable flows with well-defined attractors that can be associated with
candidate solutions and, on the other hand, the noise-induced
attractor-to-attractor dynamics in the N-phase is effectively chaotic or
a-periodic so that a DS must avoid revisiting solutions/attractors thus
accelerating the search for the best solution. Based on this understanding, we
propose a method for stochastic dynamical optimization using the N-phase DSs.
This method can be viewed as a hybrid of the simulated and chaotic annealing
methods. Our proposition can result in a new generation of hardware devices for
efficient solution of various search and/or combinatorial optimization
problems.

necessary and sufficient for optimal determination of these $n$ parameters;
each optimal position can be acquired by single parameter scan (sampling
method), or by analysis of auxiliary function (analytic method); the luminosity

The players
have to decide how much stamina to use in the semifinals, provided that the
rest is available in the final and the third-place playoff. We investigate
optimal strategies for allocating stamina to the successive matches when
players' prizes (payoffs) are given according to the tournament results. From
the basic assumption that the probability to win a match follows a
nondecreasing function of stamina difference, we present symmetric Nash
equilibria for general payoff structures. We find three different phases of the
Nash equilibria in the payoff space. First, when the champion wins a much
bigger payoff than the others, any pure strategy can constitute a Nash
equilibrium as long as all four players adopt it in common. Second, when the
first two places are much more valuable than the other two, the only Nash
equilibrium is such that everyone uses a pure strategy investing all stamina in
the semifinal. Third, when the payoff for last place is much smaller than the
others, a Nash equilibrium is formed when every player adopts a mixed strategy
of using all or none of its stamina in the semifinals. In a limiting case that
only last place pays the penalty, this mixed-strategy profile can be proved to
be a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium, at least when the winning probability
follows a Heaviside step function. Moreover, by using this Heaviside step
function, we study the tournament by using evolutionary replicator dynamics to
obtain analytic solutions, which reproduces the corresponding Nash equilibria
on the population level and gives information on dynamic aspects.

in the literature to address this shortcoming, but often at a substantial
computational overhead. In this paper, we report a simple pre-processing step
that can substantially improve the denoising performance of the bilateral

robust at large noise levels, and often tends to perform poorly below a certain
noise threshold. To get the best of the original and the modified filter, we
propose to combine them in a weighted fashion, where the weights are chosen to
minimize (a surrogate of) the oracle mean-squared-error (MSE). The
optimally-weighted filter is thus guaranteed to perform better than either of
the component filters in terms of the MSE, at all noise levels. We also provide
a fast algorithm for the weighted filtering. Visual and quantitative denoising
results on standard test images are reported which demonstrate that the
improvement over the original filter is significant both visually and in terms
of PSNR. Moreover, the denoising performance of the optimally-weighted
bilateral filter is competitive with the computation-intensive non-local means

  Cellular Networks","JSAC",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recent approach in modeling and analysis of the supply and demand in
heterogeneous wireless cellular networks has been the use of two independent
Poisson point processes (PPPs) for the locations of base stations (BSs) and
user equipments (UEs). This popular approach has two major shortcomings. First,
although the PPP model may be a fitting one for the BS locations, it is less
adequate for the UE locations mainly due to the fact that the model is not
adjustable (tunable) to represent the severity of the heterogeneity
(non-uniformity) in the UE locations. Besides, the independence assumption
between the two PPPs does not capture the often-observed correlation between
the UE and BS locations.
  This paper presents a novel heterogeneous spatial traffic modeling which
allows statistical adjustment. Simple and non-parameterized, yet sufficiently
accurate, measures for capturing the traffic characteristics in space are
introduced. Only two statistical parameters related to the UE distribution,
namely, the coefficient of variation (the normalized second-moment), of an
appropriately defined inter-UE distance measure, and correlation coefficient
(the normalized cross-moment) between UE and BS locations, are adjusted to
control the degree of heterogeneity and the bias towards the BS locations,
respectively. This model is used in heterogeneous wireless cellular networks
(HetNets) to demonstrate the impact of heterogeneous and BS-correlated traffic
on the network performance. This network is called HetHetNet since it has two
types of heterogeneity: heterogeneity in the infrastructure (supply), and
heterogeneity in the spatial traffic distribution (demand).

applications in image processing, computer vision, computer graphics, and

bilateral filter in which both the spatial and range kernels are Gaussian. A

this paper, we propose an accurate approximation algorithm that can cut down
the computational complexity to $O(1)$ per pixel for any arbitrary $\sigma$

kernel operates via the translations of a fixed Gaussian over the range space,
and that these translated Gaussians can be accurately approximated using the
so-called Gauss-polynomials. The overall algorithm emerging from this
approximation involves a series of spatial Gaussian filtering, which can be
implemented in constant-time using separability and recursion. We present some
preliminary results to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm compares

important research problem. Given the sheer size of such social networks, many
existing studies resort to sampling techniques that draw random nodes from an
online social network through its restrictive web/API interface. Almost all of
them use the exact same underlying technique of random walk - a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo based method which iteratively transits from one node to its random
neighbor.
  Random walk fits naturally with this problem because, for most online social
networks, the only query we can issue through the interface is to retrieve the
neighbors of a given node (i.e., no access to the full graph topology). A
problem with random walks, however, is the ""burn-in"" period which requires a
large number of transitions/queries before the sampling distribution converges
to a stationary value that enables the drawing of samples in a statistically
valid manner.
  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of speeding up the fundamental
design of random walks (i.e., reducing the number of queries it requires)
without changing the stationary distribution it achieves - thereby enabling a
more efficient ""drop-in"" replacement for existing sampling-based analytics
techniques over online social networks. Our main idea is to leverage the
history of random walks to construct a higher-ordered Markov chain. We develop
two algorithms, Circulated Neighbors and Groupby Neighbors Random Walk (CNRW
and GNRW) and prove that, no matter what the social network topology is, CNRW
and GNRW offer better efficiency than baseline random walks while achieving the
same stationary distribution. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
real-world social networks and synthetic graphs the superiority of our
techniques over the existing ones.

orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and interleaved division
multiple-access (IDMA). To realize the potential advantage of OFDM-IDMA, two
challenges must be addressed. The first challenge is the estimation of multiple
channel parameters. An issue is how to contain the estimation errors of the
channel parameters of the multiple users, considering that the overall
estimation errors may increase with the number of users because the estimations
of their channel parameters are intertwined with each other. The second
challenge is that the transmitters of the multiple users may be driven by
different RF oscillators. The associated frequency asynchrony may cause
multiple CFOs at the receiver. Compared with a single-user receiver where the
single CFO can be compensated away, a particular difficulty for a multiuser
receiver is that it is not possible to compensate for all the multiple CFOs
simultaneously. To tackle the two challenges, we put forth a framework to solve
the problems of multiuser channel-parameter estimation, CFO compensation, and
channel decoding jointly and iteratively. The framework employs the space
alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algortihm to decompose
the multisuser problem into multiple single-user problems, and the
expectation-conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to tackle each of the
single-user subproblems. Iterative executions of SAGE and ECM in the framework
allow the two aforementioned challenges to be tackled in an optimal manner.
Simulations and real experiments based on software-defined radio indicate that,
compared with other approaches, our approach can achieve significant
performance gains.

fact, the solution to the KGS equations propagates waves with wavelength at

$0<\varepsilon\ll 1$, which brings significantly numerical burdens in practical
computation. The MTI-FP method is designed by adapting a multiscale
decomposition by frequency to the solution at each time step and applying the
Fourier pseudospectral discretization and exponential wave integrators for
spatial and temporal derivatives, respectively. We rigorously establish two
independent error bounds for the MTI-FP at $O(\tau^2/\varepsilon^2+h^{m_0})$
and $O(\varepsilon^2+h^{m_0})$ for $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ with $\tau$ time step
size, $h$ mesh size and $m_0\ge 4$ an integer depending on the regularity of
the solution, which imply that the MTI-FP converges uniformly and optimally in
space with exponential convergence rate if the solution is smooth, and
uniformly in time with linear convergence rate at $O(\tau)$ for
$\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ and optimally with quadratic convergence rate at
$O(\tau^2)$ in the regime when either $\varepsilon=O(1)$ or $0<\varepsilon\le
\tau$. Thus the meshing strategy requirement (or $\varepsilon$-scalability) of
the MTI-FP is $\tau=O(1)$ and $h=O(1)$ for $0<\varepsilon\ll 1$, which is
significantly better than classical methods. Numerical results demonstrate that
our error bounds are optimal and sharp. Finally, the MTI-FP method is applied
to study numerically convergence rates of the KGS equations to the limiting

in braneworlds within the framework of the single brane model proposed by
Randall and Sundrum (RSII). We directly show that the evolutions of
sufficiently strong initial data configurations result in black holes (BHs)
with finite extension into the bulk. The extension changes from sphere to
pancake (or cigar, seen from a different perspective) as the size of BH
increases. We find preliminary evidences that BHs of the same size generated
from distinct initial data profiles are geometrically indistinguishable. As
such, a no-hair theorem of BH (uniqueness of BH) is suggested to hold in the
RSII spacetimes studied in this thesis---these spacetimes are axisymmetric
without angular momentum and non-gravitational charges. In particular, the BHs
we obtained as the results of the dynamical system, are consistent with the
ones previously obtained from a static vacuum system by Figueras and Wiseman.
We also obtained some results in closed form without numerical computation such
as the equality of ADM mass of the brane with the total mass of the braneworld.
  The calculation within the braneworld requires advances in the formalism of
numerical relativity (NR). The regularity problem in previous numerical
calculations in axisymmetric (and spherically symmetric) spacetimes, is
actually associated with neither coordinate systems nor the machine precision.
The fundamental variables (the unknown functions to be solved for in numerical
calculations) are more important to make the numerical calculations in
cylindrical coordinates regular. The generalized harmonic (GH) formalism and
the BSSN formalism for general relativity are developed to make them suitable
for calculations in non-Cartesian coordinates under non-flat background. A
conformal function of the metric is included into the GH formalism to simulate
the braneworld.

graphene and related layered materials. The shear (C) and layer breathing modes
(LBMs) are due to relative motions of the planes, either perpendicular or
parallel to their normal. This allows one to directly probe the interlayer
interactions in multilayer samples. Graphene and other two-dimensional (2d)
crystals can be combined to form various hybrids and heterostructures, creating
materials on demand with properties determined by the interlayer interaction.
This is the case even for a single material, where multilayer stacks with
different relative orientation have different optical and electronic
properties. In twisted multilayer graphene samples there is a significant
enhancement of the C modes due to resonance with new optically allowed
electronic transitions, determined by the relative orientation of the layers.
Here we show that this applies also to the LBMs, that can be now directly
measured at room temperature. We find that twisting does not affect LBMs, quite
different from the case of the C modes. This implies that the periodicity
mismatch between two twisted layers mostly affects shear interactions. Our work
shows that Raman spectroscopy is an ideal tool to uncover the interface
coupling of 2d hybrids and heterostructures.

reduced cross sections $\sigma_{\rm{red}}$ allows the comparison of heavy-ion
induced reaction cross sections for a broad range of masses of projectile and
target and over a wide energy range. A global behavior has been found for
strongly bound projectiles whereas much larger reduced cross sections have been
observed for weakly bound and halo projectiles. It has been shown that this
simple reduction scheme works also well for $\alpha$-particle induced reactions
on heavy target nuclei, but very recently significant deviations have been seen
for $\alpha$+$^{33}$S and $\alpha$+$^{23}$Na. Motivated by these unexpected
discrepancies, the present study analyses $\alpha$-induced reaction cross
sections for targets with masses $A \approx 20-50$. The study shows that the
experimental data for $\alpha$-induced reactions on nuclei with $A \approx
20-50$ deviate slightly from the global behavior of reduced cross sections.
However, in general the deviations evolve smoothly towards lower masses. The
only significant outliers are the recent data for $^{33}$S and $^{23}$Na which
are far above the general systematics, and some very old data may indicate that
$^{36}$Ar and $^{40}$Ar are below the general trend. As expected, also the
doubly-magic $^{40}$Ca nucleus lies slightly below the results for its
neighboring nuclei. Overall, the experimental data are nicely reproduced by a
statistical model calculation utilizing the simple $\alpha$-nucleus potential
by McFadden and Satchler. Simultaneously with the deviation of reduced cross
sections $\sigma_{\rm{red}}$ from the general behavior, the outliers $^{23}$Na,
$^{33}$S, $^{36}$Ar, and $^{40}$Ar also show significant disagreement between

and the Quantum Pigeonhole principle, construct a particular type of
ontological model that assigns an eigenvalue to each observable (independent of
context) of a system such that these assignments are consistent with the PPS.
It is shown that such an ontological model must be explicitly contextual in the
sense of the KS theorem, or otherwise implies either a restriction on free
random choice or explicitly retrocausal behavior. We call such models
PPS-contextual. The structure of each paradox is always such that there are
particular contexts of mutually commuting observables that violate the product
rule or sum rule, when the ontological model is extended to include observables
that are not measured during the experiment. These paradoxes are
counterfactual, in the sense that they are not directly observed, and also
because the product and sum rules are always obeyed by projective measurements
in actual experiments. It is shown that by adopting an alternate ontological
model, where all hidden variables are weak values (which are not always
eigenvalues, but obey the sum rule by definition), the same contexts that
presented the original paradox must also contain observables with anomalous
weak values. These anomalous weak values are not counterfactual because they
can be probed through weak measurements on an ensemble of identically pre- and
post-selected states, allowing this localized signature of KS contextuality to
be experimentally observed. The weak values of all observables of a system can
in principle be measured during an experiment, making this model a promising
candidate for describing PPS-contextual ontological `elements of reality.'

that the two sphere partition functions of a pair of dual skew symplectic sigma

develop a systematic approach to study higher-dimensional Mellin-Barnes type

the implementation of DMRG for finite anyonic systems, including a detailed

computational cost. The anyonic DMRG algorithm is demonstrated by calculating
the ground state energy of the Golden Chain, which has become the benchmark
system for the numerical study of anyons, and is shown to produce results
comparable to those of the anyonic TEBD algorithm and superior to the
variationally optimised anyonic MERA, at far lesser computational cost.

component of 5G networks, and a technique for meeting the demand for high data
rates. In a cellular network, D2D allows not only direct communication between
users, but also device relaying. In this paper, a simple instance of
device-relaying is investigated, and the impact of D2D on fairness among users
is studied. Namely, a cellular network consisting of two D2D-enabled users and
a base-station (BS) is considered. Thus, the users who want to establish
communication with the BS can act as relays for each other's signals. While
this problem is traditionally considered in the literature as a multiple-access
channel with cooperation in the uplink, and a broadcast channel with
cooperation in the downlink, we propose a different treatment of the problem as
a multi-way channel. A simple communication scheme is proposed, and is shown to
achieve significant gain in terms of fairness (measured by the symmetric rate
supported) in comparison to the aforementioned traditional treatment.

performed an experiment to assess agreement between grades attributed to
journal articles by informed peer review (IR) and by bibliometrics. A sample of
articles was evaluated by using both methods and agreement was analyzed by
weighted Cohen's kappas. ANVUR presented results as indicating an overall
'good' or 'more than adequate' agreement. This paper re-examines the experiment
results according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting
kappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement, always in the range
0.09-0.42 has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor
or, in a few cases, as, at most, fair. The only notable exception, confirmed
also by a statistical meta-analysis, was a moderate agreement for economics and
statistics (Area 13) and its sub-fields. We show that the experiment protocol
adopted in Area 13 was substantially modified with respect to all the other
research fields, to the point that results for economics and statistics have to
be considered as fatally flawed. The evidence of a poor agreement supports the
conclusion that IR and bibliometrics do not produce similar results, and that
the adoption of both methods in the Italian research assessment possibly
introduced systematic and unknown biases in its final results. The conclusion
reached by ANVUR must be reversed: the available evidence does not justify at
all the joint use of IR and bibliometrics within the same research assessment

between the sites, is sometimes modelled by a product of random matrices, with
each diagonal elements representing the growth rate in a given time period, and
off-diagonal elements the migration rate. If the sites are reinterpreted as age
classes, the same model may apply to a single population with age-dependent
mortality and reproduction.
  We consider the case where the off-diagonal elements are small, representing
a situation where there is little migration or, alternatively, where a
deterministic life-history has been slightly disrupted, for example by
introducing a rare delay in development. We examine the asymptotic behaviour of
the long-term growth rate. We show that when the highest growth rate is
attained at two different sites in the absence of migration (which is always
the case when modelling a single age-structured population) the increase in
stochastic growth rate due to a migration rate $\epsilon$ is like $(\log
\epsilon^{-1})^{-1}$ as $\epsilon\downarrow 0$, under fairly generic
conditions. When there is a single site with the highest growth rate the
behavior is more delicate, depending on the tails of the growth rates. For the
case when the log growth rates have Gaussian-like tails we show that the
behavior near zero is like a power of $\epsilon$, and derive upper and lower
bounds for the power in terms of the difference in the growth rates and the
distance between the sites.

systems to facilitate the integration of renewable distributed generation

advanced (typically model-based) techniques naturally posing an interesting
challenge to the control community. Although there are widely accepted reduced
order models to describe the dynamic behavior of microgrids, they are typically
presented without details about the reduction procedure---hampering the
understanding of the physical phenomena behind them. Preceded by an
introduction to basic notions and definitions in power systems, the present
survey reviews key characteristics and main components of a microgrid. We
introduce the reader to the basic functionality of DC/AC inverters, as well as
to standard operating modes and control schemes of inverter-interfaced power
sources in microgrid applications. Based on this exposition and starting from
fundamental physics, we present detailed dynamical models of the main microgrid
components. Furthermore, we clearly state the underlying assumptions which lead
to the standard reduced model with inverters represented by controllable
voltage sources, as well as static network and load representations, hence,
providing a complete modular model derivation of a three-phase inverter-based
microgrid.

compositional model for natural language of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark in
three ways: Firstly, I propose a concrete instantiation of the abstract

improves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the
language, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results.
The proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models that find
intuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. Secondly, I
propose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which
explicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work
with Pulman). A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of
vector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. Extensive
experimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more
accurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al. in
particular and every other class of compositional models in general. As a last
contribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the
context of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum
mechanics (joint work with Coecke). In the proposed extension, the concept of a
distributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which
compactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different
meanings of the specific word. Composition takes the form of quantum
measurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and
linguistics.

Budgeted MAB, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost
is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in
which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a
Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this
case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of
the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the
maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the
distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is $O(\ln B)$, where $B$
denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this
algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general
distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

decaying fluxes induce D-brane charges this process must be accompanied with an
annihilation of D-branes. This occurs via dynamics inside the bubble wall as
was well described for (anti-)D3 branes branes annihilating against 3-form
fluxes. In this paper we extend this to the other Dp branes with p smaller than
seven. Generically there are two decay channels: one for the RR flux and one
for the NSNS flux. The RR channel is accompanied by brane annihilation that can
be understood from the Dp branes polarising into D(p+2) branes, whereas the
NSNS channel corresponds to Dp branes polarising into NS5 branes or KK5 branes.
We illustrate this with the decay of antibranes probing local toroidal throat
geometries obtained from T-duality of the D6 solution in massive type IIA. We
show that anti-Dp branes are metastable against annihilation in these

tasks such as analogy detection, relational search, and relation
classification. Although there have been several proposals for learning
representations for individual words, learning word representations that
explicitly capture the semantic relations between words remains under
developed. We propose an unsupervised method for learning vector
representations for words such that the learnt representations are sensitive to
the semantic relations that exist between two words. First, we extract lexical
patterns from the co-occurrence contexts of two words in a corpus to represent
the semantic relations that exist between those two words. Second, we represent
a lexical pattern as the weighted sum of the representations of the words that
co-occur with that lexical pattern. Third, we train a binary classifier to
detect relationally similar vs. non-similar lexical pattern pairs. The proposed
method is unsupervised in the sense that the lexical pattern pairs we use as
train data are automatically sampled from a corpus, without requiring any
manual intervention. Our proposed method statistically significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art word representations on three
benchmark datasets for proportional analogy detection, demonstrating its
ability to accurately capture the semantic relations among words.

Josephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect

also address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing to engineer the Jaynes-Cummings

with light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott-superfluid transition
observed with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent
theoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic
gauge fields and spin-orbit couplings have been successfully implemented with
ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices --- using time-dependent Floquet
perturbations periodic in time, for example --- as well as in photonic lattice

of cross-sectional area $S$, we find that the bending fluctuation part scales
with the inter-membrane separation $d$ as $d^{-2}$ for $d \ll \sqrt{S}$, but
crosses over to $d^{-4}$ scaling for $d \gg \sqrt{S}$, whereas the zero mode
part of the steric potential always scales as $d^{-2}$. For membranes
interacting exclusively via the steric potential, we obtain closed-form
expressions for the effective interaction potential and for the rms undulation
amplitude $\sigma$, which becomes small at low temperatures $T$ and/or large
bending stiffnesses $\kappa$. Moreover, $\sigma$ scales as $d$ for $d \ll
\sqrt{S}$, but saturates at $\sqrt{k_{{\rm B}} T S/\kappa}$ for $d \gg
\sqrt{S}$. In addition, using variational Gaussian theory, we apply our
self-consistent treatment to study inter-membrane interactions subject to three
different types of potential: (i)~the Moreira-Netz potential for a pair of
strongly charged membranes with an intervening solution of multivalent
counterions, (ii)~an attractive square well, (iii)~the Morse potential, and
(iv)~a combination of hydration and van der Waals interactions.

network. We characterize the model's average activity $F_T$ after $T$ time
steps and the transition from a collective (global) extinct state to an active
state in parameter space. We provide an explicit relation between the
parameters of our model at the frontier between these states. A collective
active state can be associated to a global epidemic spread, or to a persistent
neuronal activity. We found that $F_T$ does not depends on disorder in the
network if the transmission rate $r$ or the average coordination number $K$ are
large enough. The collective extinct-active transition can be induced by
changing two parameters associated to the network: $K$ and the disorder
parameter $p$ (which controls the variance of $K$). We can also induce the
transition by changing $r$, which controls the threshold size in the dynamics.
In order to operate at the transition the parameters of the model must satisfy
the relation $rK=a_p$, where $a_p$ as a function of $p/(1-p)$ is a stretched
exponential function. Our results are relevant for systems that operate {\it
at} the transition in order to increase its dynamic range and/or to operate
under optimal information-processing conditions. We discuss how glassy

Such instance-optimal algorithms simultaneously subsume output-sensitive
algorithms and distribution-dependent average-case algorithms, and all
algorithms that do not take advantage of the order of the input or that assume

readout methods that require illumination of a specific region of the
microstructure. Here we explore and exploit the diffraction effects that have
been previously neglected when modeling cantilever bending measurement
techniques. The illumination of a cantilever end causes an asymmetric
diffraction pattern at the photodetector that significantly affects the
calibration of the signal in the popular optical beam deflection technique
(OBDT). Conditions for optimized linear signals that avoid detection artifacts
conflict with small numerical aperture illumination and narrow cantilevers
which are softer and therefore more sensitive. Embracing diffraction patterns
as a physical measurable allows a richer detection technique that decouples
measurements of tilt and curvature and simultaneously relaxes the requirements
on the alignment of illumination and detector. We show analytical results,
numerical simulations and physiologically relevant experimental data
demonstrating the usefulness of these diffraction features. We offer
experimental design guidelines and identify and quantify possible sources of
systematic error of up to 10% in OBDT. We demonstrate a new nanometre
resolution detection method that can replace OBDT, where Frauenhofer and Bragg
diffraction effects from finite sized and patterned cantilevers are exploited.
Such effects are readily generalized to arrays, and allow transmission
detection of mechanical curvature, enabling in-line instruments. In particular,
a cantilever with a periodic array of slots produces Bragg peaks which can be
analyzed to deduce the cantilever curvature. We highlight the comparative
advantages over OBDT by detecting molecular activity of antibiotic Vancomycin,
with an RMS noise equivalent to less than $2.5 \mu M$ (1.5 nm), as example of
possible multi-maker bio-assays.

such approaches, the source is reconstructed analytically, using a subset of a

calculate the flux in an image plane pixel, the pixel is split into two or more
triangles (depending on the local magnification), and each shapelet basis
function is integrated over the source plane. Source regularization
(enforcement of priors on the source) can also be performed analytically. This

previous work, we have introduced a clustering algorithm referred to as

currently conceived, in order to carry out an all-sky search on a $\approx$
year of data, significant computational resources may be required in order to
carry out background estimation. Alternatively, some of the sensitivity of the
search must be sacrificed to control computational costs. The sensitivity of
the algorithm is limited by the amount of computing resources due to the
requirement of performing background studies to assign significance in
gravitational-wave searches. In this paper, we present an analytic method for

  precursor of the Q-phase",,,,,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown by detailed inelastic neutron scattering experiments that the
gapped collective magnetic excitation of the unconventional superconductor
CeCoIn$_{5}$, the spin resonance mode, is incommensurate and that the
corresponding fluctuations are of Ising nature. The incommensurate peak
position of these fluctuations corresponds to the propagation vector of the
adjacent field induced static magnetic ordered phase, the so-called Q-phase.
Furthermore, the direction of the magnetic moment fluctuations is also the
direction of the ordered magnetic moments of the Q-phase. Hence the resonance
mode and the Q-phase share the same symmetry and this strongly supports a
scenario where the static order is realized by a condensation of the magnetic
excitation.

square and diamond quantum rings and analyze how sample geometry affects those
features. We show that low energy levels of diamond rings form two groups
delocalized between opposite corners which results in increased number of
optical transitions. We also show that contacts applied to corner areas allow
for continuous change between square- and diamond-like behavior of the same
sample, irrespective of its shape.

scalar in addition to the metric tensor at the boundary. Fixing Ricci scalar at
the boundary implies that the classical solutions are fixed once and forever to
the de-Sitter or anti de-Sitter solutions. Here, we justify such requirement
from the standpoint of Noether Symmetry.

model has three elements: a processing unit responsible for a mathematical
operation, an initial equally weighted superposition and a quantum state used
as resource. The randomness depends on the last.

extremely improbable that space is Euclidean, and that it is unspeakably
improbable that space is hyperbolic. Independently, using an argument which
makes no appeal to black holes, but only to the ratio of volumes in hyperbolic
space of Hubble volumes from different times, we prove that space is not
hyperbolic. We conclude by discussing some implications of these results, when
conjoined with the assumption that the entropy of a black hole is the hidden
information about its internal configuration.

structure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks. These include
bond percolation, site percolation, $k$-core percolation, bootstrap
percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts Threshold Model
(WTM). We show that --- except for bond percolation --- each of these processes
arises as a special case of the WTM and bond percolation arises from a small
modification. In fact ""heterogeneous $k$-core percolation"", a corresponding
""heterogeneous bootstrap percolation"" model, and the generalized epidemic
process are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show
that a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals ""transmit"" or
""send a message"" to their neighbors with some probability less than $1$ can be
reformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in
fact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the
set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding
the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node
thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these
results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these
other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular
case may in fact apply much more generally.

  Theory of Measurement",,,,,"physics.gen-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Here we propose a pair of experiments to distinguish the recently proposed
""slicing theory"" of quantum measurement, which gives a transient many worlds
picture, and decoherence. Since these two theories are essentially ""opposites""
in their approach and both claim to arise from the many body Schr\""odinger
equation itself, there is no chance of them being equivalent representations of
the same reality. It will be explicitly shown that each theory gives very
different answers to the questions of back reaction and revival of phase
effects after measurement. We suggest that the kinds of isolated systems now
possible in optical traps is now sufficient to generate a selective distinction
between these two theories. In particular we show that the slicing theory gives
examples of interference from ""revival of histories"" in controlled examples but
no back reaction on the measurement devices whereas decoherence gives the
opposite.
