and some covariates are often left unmodeled. This article introduces ""rebar,""
a method using high-dimensional modeling to incorporate these commonly
discarded data without sacrificing the integrity of the matching design. After
constructing a match, a researcher uses the unmatched control subjects--the
remnant--to fit a machine learning model predicting control potential outcomes
as a function of the full covariate matrix. The resulting predictions in the
matched set are used to adjust the causal estimate to reduce confounding bias.
We present theoretical results to justify the method's bias-reducing properties
as well as a simulation study that demonstrates them. Additionally, we
illustrate the method in an evaluation of a school-level comprehensive
educational reform program in Arizona.

sparticle masses using the MT2 variable, which could be combined with
cross-section and other measurements to constrain the gluino, squark and stop
masses and hence the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters m_0, m_{1/2} and
A_0 of the CMSSM. Slepton measurements at CLIC would enable m_0 and m_{1/2} to
be determined with high precision. If supersymmetry is indeed discovered in the
low-mass region, precision electroweak and Higgs measurements with a future
circular electron-positron collider (FCC-ee, also known as TLEP) combined with
LHC measurements would provide tests of the CMSSM at the loop level. If
supersymmetry is not discovered at the LHC, is likely to lie somewhere along a
focus-point, stop coannihilation strip or direct-channel A/H resonance funnel.

nuclear activity (AGN) can drive the transformation of gas-rich spiral mergers
into ULIRGs, and, eventually, lead to the build-up of QSO/elliptical hosts. We
study the role that star formation and AGN feedback have in launching and
maintaining the molecular outflows in two starburst-dominated advanced mergers,
NGC1614 and IRAS17208-0014, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics of
their molecular gas reservoirs. We have used the PdBI array to image with high
spatial resolution (0.5""-1.2"") the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line emissions in
NGC1614 and IRAS17208-0014, respectively. The velocity fields of the gas are
analyzed and modeled to find the evidence of molecular outflows in these
sources and characterize the mass, momentum and energy of these components.
While most (>95%) of the CO emission stems from spatially-resolved
(~2-3kpc-diameter) rotating disks, we also detect in both mergers the emission
from high-velocity line wings that extend up to +-500-700km/s, well beyond the
estimated virial range associated with rotation and turbulence. The kinematic
major axis of the line wing emission is tilted by ~90deg in NGC1614 and by
~180deg in IRAS17208-0014 relative to their respective rotating disk major
axes. These results can be explained by the existence of non-coplanar molecular
outflows in both systems. In stark contrast with NGC1614, where star formation
alone can drive its molecular outflow, the mass, energy and momentum budget
requirements of the molecular outflow in IRAS17208-0014 can be best accounted
for by the existence of a so far undetected (hidden) AGN of L_AGN~7x10^11
L_sun. The geometry of the molecular outflow in IRAS17208-0014 suggests that
the outflow is launched by a non-coplanar disk that may be associated with a
buried AGN in the western nucleus.

large domains of monolayer WSe2 and their growth mechanism studies are
important steps toward applications of WSe2. Here, we report systematical
studies on ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of monolayer
and few layer WSe2 flakes directly on silica substrates. The WSe2 flakes were
characterized using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We investigated how growth
parameters, with emphases on growth temperatures and durations, affect the
sizes, layer numbers, and shapes of as-grown WSe2 flakes. We also demonstrated
that transport properties of CVD-grown monolayer WSe2, similar to
mechanically-exfoliated samples, can be tuned into either p-type or ambipolar
electrical behavior, depending on the types of metal contacts. These results
deepen our understandings on the vapor phase growth mechanism of WSe2, and may
benefit the uses of these CVD-grown monolayer materials in electronic and
optoelectronics.

multi-fiber spectrograph capable of obtaining radial velocities for 60 objects
at a time in order to find brown dwarfs and giant planets. The survey was
configured to target dwarf stars with effective temperatures approximately
between $4500$ and $6250 \, \mbox{K}$. For the first 2 years MARVELS relied on
low-resolution spectroscopic pre-observations to estimate the effective
temperature and $\log(g)$ for candidate stars and then selected suitable dwarf
stars from this pool. Ultimately, the pre-observation spectra proved
ineffective at filtering out giant stars; many giants were incorrectly
classified as dwarfs, resulting in a giant contamination rate of $\sim$30\% for
the first phase of the MARVELS survey. Thereafter, the survey instead applied a
reduced proper motion cut to eliminate giants and used the Infrared Flux Method
to estimate effective temperatures, using only extant photometric and
proper-motion catalog information. The target selection method introduced here
may be useful for other surveys that need to rely on extant catalog data for
selection of specific stellar populations.

black hole should have a discrete energy spectrum with concomitant discrete
line emission. The quantized black-hole radiation spectrum is expected to be
very different from Hawking's semi-classical prediction of a thermal black-hole
radiation spectrum. One naturally wonders: Is it possible to reconcile the {\it
discrete} quantum spectrum suggested by Bekenstein with the {\it continuous}
semi-classical spectrum suggested by Hawking ? In order to address this
fundamental question, in this essay we shall consider the zero-point
quantum-gravity fluctuations of the black-hole spacetime. In a quantum theory
of gravity, these spacetime fluctuations are closely related to the
characteristic gravitational resonances of the corresponding black-hole
spacetime. Assuming that the energy of the black-hole radiation stems from
these zero-point quantum-gravity fluctuations of the black-hole spacetime, we
derive the effective temperature of the quantized black-hole radiation
spectrum. Remarkably, it is shown that this characteristic temperature of the
{\it discrete} (quantized) black-hole radiation agrees with the well-known
Hawking temperature of the {\it continuous} (semi-classical) black-hole

fundamental roles as abstraction mechanisms. The angelic nature of a choice
pertains to the property of avoiding failure whenever possible. As a concept,
angelic choice first appeared in automata theory and Turing machines, where it
can be implemented via backtracking. It has traditionally been studied in the
refinement calculus, and has proved to be useful in a variety of applications
and refinement techniques. Recently it has been studied within relational,
multirelational and higher-order models. It has been employed for modelling
user interactions, game-like scenarios, theorem proving tactics, constraint
satisfaction problems and control systems.
  When the formal modelling of state-rich reactive systems is considered, it
only seems natural that both types of nondeterministic choice should be
considered. However, despite several treatments of angelic nondeterminism in
the context of process algebras, namely Communicating Sequential Processes, the
counterpart to the angelic choice of the refinement calculus has been elusive.
  In this thesis, we develop a semantics in the relational setting of Hoare and
He's Unifying Theories of Programming that enables the characterisation of
angelic nondeterminism in CSP. Since CSP processes are given semantics in the
UTP via designs, that is, pre and postcondition pairs, we first introduce a
theory of angelic designs, and an isomorphic multirelational model, that is
suitable for characterising processes. We then develop a theory of reactive
angelic designs by enforcing the healthiness conditions of CSP. Finally, by
introducing a notion of divergence that can undo the history of events, we
obtain a model where angelic choice avoids divergence.

the way in which the choice of internal clock determines the quantum dynamics
and how much different quantum dynamics induced by different clocks are. We
develop our method of comparison by extending the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of
contact transformations to include a new type of transformations which
transform both the canonical variables and the internal clock. We employ our
method to study the quantum dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaitre model and obtain
semiclassical corrections to the classical dynamics, which depend on the choice
of internal clock. For a unique quantisation map we find the abundance of
inequivalent semiclassical corrections induced by quantum dynamics taking place
in different internal clocks. It follows that the concepts like minimal volume,
maximal curvature and the number of quantum bounces, often used to describe
quantum effects in cosmological models, depend on the choice of internal clock.

20 to 500G. We find a substantial variation of the properties of the surface
magnetoconvection between main-sequence stars of different spectral types. As a
consequence of a reduced efficiency of the convective collapse of flux tubes, M
dwarfs lack bright magnetic structures in unipolar regions of moderate field
strength. The spatial correlation between velocity and the magnetic field as

species that co-occur in a habitat, but most food web studies have omitted
parasites and their interactions. Recent studies have provided conflicting
evidence on whether including parasites changes food web structure, with some
suggesting that parasitic interactions are structurally distinct from those
among free-living species while others claim the opposite. Here, we describe a
principled method for understanding food web structure that combines an
efficient optimization algorithm from statistical physics called parallel
tempering with a probabilistic generalization of the empirically well-supported
food web niche model. This generative model approach allows us to rigorously
estimate the degree to which interactions that involve parasites are
statistically distinguishable from interactions among free-living species,
whether parasite niches behave similarly to free-living niches, and the degree
to which existing hypotheses about food web structure are naturally recovered.
We apply this method to the well-studied Flensburg Fjord food web and show that
while predation on parasites, concomitant predation of parasites, and parasitic
intraguild trophic interactions are largely indistinguishable from free-living
predation interactions, parasite-host interactions are different. These results
provide a powerful new tool for evaluating the impact of classes of species and
interactions on food web structure to shed new light on the roles of parasites

essentially dust free. The evolution from one regime to the other must also be
very fast, since evolved and dusty galaxies show up at redshifts corresponding
to a Universe which is only about 500 Myr old. In the present paper models
which predicts the existence of an apparent dichotomy between dusty and
dust-free galaxies at high redshift are considered. Galaxies become dusty as
soon as they reach an evolved state and the transition is very rapid. A special
case suggests that while stellar dust production is overall relatively
insignificant -- contrary to what has been argued recently -- it can at the
same time be consistent with efficient dust production in supernovae in the
local Universe. Special attention will be given to the recent discovery of a
dusty normal galaxy (A1689-zD1) at a very high redshift z = 7.5 +/- 0.2.

rigorously based on many-body Green's function theory but incorporating
information from density functional theory, has already been demonstrated for
the optical gaps and spectra of solid-state systems. Interest in photoactive
hybrid organic/inorganic systems has recently increased, and so has the use of
the BSE for computing neutral excitations of organic molecules. However, no
systematic benchmarks of the BSE for neutral electronic excitations of organic
molecules exist. Here, we study the performance of the BSE for the 28 small
molecules in Thiel's widely-used time-dependent density functional theory
benchmark set [M. Schreiber et al. J. Chem. Phys. 128, 134110 (2008)]. We
observe that the BSE produces results that depend critically on the mean-field
starting point employed in the perturbative approach. We find that this
starting point dependence is mainly introduced through the quasiparticle
energies obtained at the intermediate GW step, and that with a judicious choice
of starting mean-field, singlet excitation energies obtained from BSE are in
excellent quantitative agreement with higher-level wavefunction methods. The
quality of the triplet excitations is slightly less satisfactory.

inverse problem arising in data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN
consists in estimating the intensity function of an indirectly observed Poisson
point process. Unfolding typically proceeds in two steps: one first produces a
regularized point estimate of the unknown intensity and then uses the
variability of this estimator to form frequentist confidence intervals that
quantify the uncertainty of the solution. In this paper, we propose forming the
point estimate using empirical Bayes estimation which enables a data-driven
choice of the regularization strength through marginal maximum likelihood
estimation. Observing that neither Bayesian credible intervals nor standard
bootstrap confidence intervals succeed in achieving good frequentist coverage
in this problem due to the inherent bias of the regularized point estimate, we
introduce an iteratively bias-corrected bootstrap technique for constructing
improved confidence intervals. We show using simulations that this enables us
to achieve nearly nominal frequentist coverage with only a modest increase in
interval length. The proposed methodology is applied to unfolding the $Z$ boson
invariant mass spectrum as measured in the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron

temperature -- i.e., extended ranges of short-range correlations. The plateau
arises from competition between Fermi- surface nesting and a `hidden' Van Hove
singularity (VHS) nesting, associated with a bulk contribution to the
susceptibility. As such, the VHS contribution is not tied to the Fermi level
but rather turns on near $T_{VHS}=(E_F-E_{VHS})/k_B$ [where $E_F$ is the Fermi
energy and $E_{VHS}$ the energy of the VHS peak]. Identifying $T^*\simeq

we investigate whether the same trends exist in the original morphology density
relation, using the same data as Dressler. In addition to Dressler's canonical
relations, we find that further refinements are possible when considering the
average local projected density of galaxies in a cluster. Firstly, the
distribution of ellipticals in a cluster depends on the relative local density
of galaxies in that cluster: equivalent rises in the elliptical fraction occur
at higher local densities for clusters with higher average local densities.
This is not true for the late-type fraction, where the variation with local
density within a cluster is independent of the average local density of
galaxies in that cluster, and is as Dressler originally found. Furthermore, the
overall ratio of ellipticals to early-types in a cluster does not depend on the
average density of galaxies in that cluster (unlike the ratio of lenticulars to
disk systems), and is fixed at around 30%. In the paradigm of fast and slow
rotators, we show that such an elliptical fraction in the early-type population
is consistent with a slow rotator fraction of 15% in the early-type population,
using the statistics of the ATLAS3D survey. We also find the scatter in the
overall ratio of ellipticals to early-types is greatest for clusters with lower
average densities, such that clusters with the highest elliptical fractions
have the lowest average local densities. Finally, we show that average local
projected density correlates well with global projected density, but the latter
has difficulty in accurately characterising the density of irregular cluster

population paradigm (Jang et al. 2014), we have suggested that the RR Lyrae
variables in the Oosterhoff groups I, II, and III globular clusters (GCs) are
produced mostly by the first, second, and third generation stars (G1, G2, and
G3), respectively. Here we show, for the first time, that the observed
dichotomies in the inner and outer halo GCs can be naturally reproduced when
these models are extended to all metallicity regimes, while maintaining
reasonable agreements in the horizontal-branch type versus [Fe/H] correlations.
In order to achieve this, however, specific star formation histories are
required for the inner and outer halos. In the inner halo GCs, the star
formation commenced and ceased earlier with relatively short formation
timescale between the subpopulations (~0.5 Gyr), while in the outer halo, the
formation of G1 was delayed by ~0.8 Gyr with more extended timescale between G1
and G2 (~1.4 Gyr). This is consistent with the dual origin of the Milky Way
halo. Despite the difference in detail, our models show that the Oosterhoff
period groups observed in both outer and inner halo GCs are all manifestations
of the ""population-shift"" effect within the instability strip, for which the
origin can be traced back to the two or three discrete episodes of star
formation in GCs.

active galactic nuclei feedback is needed to reproduce the observed

scalings between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, dust mass and gas mass,
dust-to-gas ratio and stellar mass, and dust-to-stellar mass ratio and gas

Type II supernovae, with the contribution from asymptotic giant branch stars
below 20 per cent for $z \gtrsim 5$. While our suite of Milky Way-sized

we have been able to measure the metallicities of the stellar and globular
cluster components in 12 early-type galaxies out to more than $10~\rm{R_{e}}$.
We find similar metallicity gradients for the metal-poor and metal-rich
globular cluster subpopulations, suggesting a common formation process for the
two subpopulations. This is in conflict with most current theoretical
predictions, where the metal-poor globular clusters are thought to be purely
accreted and metal-rich globular clusters mostly formed in-situ. Moreover, we
find that the globular cluster metallicity gradients show a trend with galaxy
mass, being steeper in lower-mass galaxies than in higher-mass galaxies. This
is similar to what we find for the outermost galaxy stars and suggests a more
active accretion history, with a larger role played by major mergers, in the
most massive galaxies. This conclusion is qualitatively consistent with
expectations from two-phase galaxy assembly models. Finally, we find that the
small difference in metallicity between galaxy stars and metal-rich globular
clusters at $1~\rm{R_{e}}$ may correlate with galaxy mass. The origin of this

published data and fits performed to the surface brightness profiles of two
samples of Type-III galaxies in the R and Spitzer 3.6 microns bands. We have
performed linear fits to the correlations followed by different galaxy types in
each plane, as well as several statistical tests to determine their
significance. We have found that: 1) the antitruncated discs of all galaxy
types from Sa to Scd obey tight scaling relations both in R and 3.6 microns, as
observed in S0s; 2) the majority of these correlations are significant
accounting for the numbers of the available data samples; 3) the trends are
clearly linear when the characteristic scalelengths are plotted on a
logarithmic scale; and 4) the correlations relating the characteristic surface
brightnesses of the inner and outer discs and the breaks with the various
characteristic scalelengths significantly improve when the latter are
normalized to the optical radius of the galaxy. The results suggest that the
scaling relations of Type-III discs are independent of the morphological type
and the presence (or absence) of bars within the observational uncertainties of
the available datasets, although larger and deeper samples are required to
confirm this. The tight structural coupling implied by these scaling relations
impose strong constraints on the mechanisms proposed for explaining the

and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.
However, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence
of correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite
designation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo
transition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these
errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct
galaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), and
to result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red
galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly
recovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as
function of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic
conformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is
present. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from
group catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running group
finders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on the
HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.

noncommutative systems to fairly higher values beyond the usual systems.
Despite of having classical-like behaviour, coherent states in noncommutative

data. Given hours of video, the proposed method produces a compact storyboard
summary of the camera wearer's day. In contrast to traditional keyframe
selection techniques, the resulting summary focuses on the most important
objects and people with which the camera wearer interacts. To accomplish this,
we develop region cues indicative of high-level saliency in egocentric
video---such as the nearness to hands, gaze, and frequency of occurrence---and
learn a regressor to predict the relative importance of any new region based on
these cues. Using these predictions and a simple form of temporal event
detection, our method selects frames for the storyboard that reflect the key
object-driven happenings. We adjust the compactness of the final summary given
either an importance selection criterion or a length budget; for the latter, we
design an efficient dynamic programming solution that accounts for importance,
visual uniqueness, and temporal displacement. Critically, the approach is
neither camera-wearer-specific nor object-specific; that means the learned
importance metric need not be trained for a given user or context, and it can
predict the importance of objects and people that have never been seen
previously. Our results on two egocentric video datasets show the method's
promise relative to existing techniques for saliency and summarization.

spatially-unresolved structures in the nuclei of distant galaxies with

broad emission-line region, with angular sizes of microarcseconds, can be
constrained through the substitution of time resolution for spatial resolution.
Many reverberation experiments over the last 30 years have led to a practical
understanding of the requirements necessary for a successful program. With
reverberation measurements now in hand for 60 active galaxies, and more on the
horizon, we are able to directly constrain black hole masses, derive scaling
relationships that allow large numbers of black hole mass estimates throughout
the observable Universe, and begin investigating the detailed geometry and
kinematics of the broad line region. Reverberation mapping is therefore one of
the few techniques available that will allow a deeper understanding of the
physical mechanisms involved in AGN feeding and feedback at very small scales,
as well as constraints on the growth and evolution of black holes across cosmic
time. In this contribution, I will briefly review the background,

changes; sophisticated enhanced sampling methods have been proposed to generate
these macromolecular transition paths. As such paths are curves in a
high-dimensional space, they have been difficult to compare quantitatively, a
prerequisite to, for instance, assess the quality of different sampling
algorithms. The Path Similarity Analysis (PSA) approach alleviates these
difficulties by utilizing the full information in 3N-dimensional trajectories
in configuration space. PSA employs the Hausdorff or Fr\'echet path
metrics---adopted from computational geometry---enabling us to quantify path
(dis)similarity, while the new concept of a Hausdorff-pair map permits the
extraction of atomic-scale determinants responsible for path differences.
Combined with clustering techniques, PSA facilitates the comparison of many
paths, including collections of transition ensembles. We use the closed-to-open
transition of the enzyme adenylate kinase (AdK)---a commonly used testbed for
the assessment enhanced sampling algorithms---to examine multiple microsecond
equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) transitions of AdK in its substrate-free
form alongside transition ensembles from the MD-based dynamic importance
sampling (DIMS-MD) and targeted MD (TMD) methods, and a geometrical targeting
algorithm (FRODA). A Hausdorff pairs analysis of these ensembles revealed, for
instance, that differences in DIMS-MD and FRODA paths were mediated by a set of
conserved salt bridges whose charge-charge interactions are fully modeled in
DIMS-MD but not in FRODA. We also demonstrate how existing trajectory analysis
methods relying on pre-defined collective variables, such as native contacts or
geometric quantities, can be used synergistically with PSA, as well as the
application of PSA to more complex systems such as membrane transporter
proteins.

back as holes - a process called Andreev reflection. In a normal metal where
the Fermi energy is much larger than a typical superconducting gap, the
reflected hole retraces the path taken by the incident electron. In graphene
with ultra low disorder, however, the Fermi energy can be tuned to be smaller
than the superconducting gap. In this unusual limit, the holes are expected to
be reflected specularly at the superconductor-graphene interface due to the
onset of interband Andreev processes, where the effective mass of the reflected
holes change sign. Here we present measurements of gate modulated Andreev
reflections across the low disorder van der Waals interface formed between
graphene and the superconducting NbSe2. We find that the conductance across the

phase remains translationally invariant, whereas the BCS phase transforms into
the supersolid phase. For a two-dimensional system this effect occurs at
arbitrary small amplitude of the radiation field.

synchronous operation or cyclic update orders. When worker nodes are
heterogeneous (due to different computational capabilities or different

they will leave workers idle waiting for the slower nodes to complete their
computations. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous mini-batch algorithm
for regularized stochastic optimization problems with smooth loss functions
that eliminates idle waiting and allows workers to run at their maximal update
rates. We show that by suitably choosing the step-size values, the algorithm
achieves a rate of the order $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for general convex regularization
functions, and the rate $O(1/T)$ for strongly convex regularization functions,
where $T$ is the number of iterations. In both cases, the impact of asynchrony
on the convergence rate of our algorithm is asymptotically negligible, and a
near-linear speedup in the number of workers can be expected. Theoretical

individuals are recorded in a set of possible discrete states. Traditionally,
the Arnason-Schwarz model has been fitted to such data where the state process
is modeled as a first-order Markov chain, though second-order models have also
been proposed and fitted to data. However, low-order Markov models may not
accurately represent the underlying biology. For example, specifying a
(time-independent) first-order Markov process assumes that the dwell time in
each state (i.e., the duration of a stay in a given state) has a geometric
distribution, and hence that the modal dwell time is one. Specifying
time-dependent or higher-order processes provides additional flexibility, but
at the expense of a potentially significant number of additional model
parameters. We extend the Arnason-Schwarz model by specifying a semi-Markov
model for the state process, where the dwell-time distribution is specified
more generally, using for example a shifted Poisson or negative binomial
distribution. A state expansion technique is applied in order to represent the
resulting semi-Markov Arnason-Schwarz model in terms of a simpler and
computationally tractable hidden Markov model. Semi-Markov Arnason-Schwarz
models come with only a very modest increase in the number of parameters, yet
permit a significantly more flexible state process. Model selection can be
performed using standard procedures, and in particular via the use of
information criteria. The semi-Markov approach allows for important biological
inference to be drawn on the underlying state process, for example on the times
spent in the different states. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated
in a simulation study, before being applied to real data corresponding to house
finches where the states correspond to the presence or absence of

found a power spectrum with a well-defined shape, characterized by three
features. The first term is the 22 yr solar magnetic cycle, estimated in our
work to be of 18.43 yr. The second term is related to the daily volatility of
sunspots. This term is most likely produced by the turbulent motions linked to
the solar granulation. The last term corresponds to a periodic source
associated with the solar magnetic activity, for which the maximum of power
spectral density occurs at 22.67 days. This value is part of the 22-27 day
periodicity region that shows an above-average intensity in the power spectra.
The origin of this 22.67 day periodic process is not clearly identified, and
there is a possibility that it can be produced by convective flows inside the
star. The study clearly shows a north-south asymmetry. The 18.43 yr periodical
source is correlated between the two hemispheres, but the 22.67 day one is not
correlated. It is shown that towards the large timescales an excess occurs in
the northern hemisphere, especially near the previous two periodic sources. To
further investigate the 22.67 day periodicity we made a Lomb-Scargle spectral
analysis. The study suggests that this periodicity is distinct from others
found nearby.

HERO is designed to be used as a postprocessor. Given some fixed fluid
structure for the disc (i.e. density and velocity as a function of position
from a hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics simulation), the code obtains a
self-consistent solution for the radiation field and for the gas temperatures
using the condition of radiative equilibrium. The novel aspect of HERO is that
it combines two techniques: 1) a short characteristics (SC) solver that quickly
converges to a self consistent disc temperature and radiation field, with 2) a
long characteristics (LC) solver that provides a more accurate solution for the
radiation near the photosphere and in the optically thin regions. By combining
these two techniques, we gain both the computational speed of SC and the high
accuracy of LC. We present tests of HERO on a range of 1D, 2D and 3D problems

We utilize high-resolution spectropolarimetry and the magnetic Doppler imaging

is predominately dipolar, with a polar strength Bd = 7.3-7.8 kG and a smaller
non-axisymmetric quadrupolar contribution, as well as the surface distribution
of abundance of He, Fe, C, and Si. We describe a revised RRM model that now
accepts an arbitrary surface magnetic field configuration, with the field
topology from the MDI models used as input. The resulting synthetic Ha emission
and broadband photometric observations generally agree with observations,
however, several features are poorly fit. To explore the possibility of a
photospheric contribution to the observed photometric variability, the MDI
abundance maps were used to compute a synthetic photospheric light curve to
determine the effect of the surface inhomogeneities. Including the computed
photospheric brightness modulation fails to improve the agreement between the
observed and computed photometry. We conclude that the discrepancies cannot be
explained as an effect of inhomogeneous surface abundance. Analysis of the UV
light variability shows good agreement between observed variability and
computed light curves, supporting the accuracy of the photospheric light
variation calculation. We thus conclude that significant additional physics is
necessary for the RRM model to acceptably reproduce observations of not only

ensuring proper treatment of patients and also for understanding the molecular
mechanisms driving this disease. While there have been several gene signatures
proposed in the literature to classify breast tumours, these signatures show
very low overlaps, different classification performance, and not much relevance
to the underlying biology of these tumours. Here we evaluate DNA-damage
response (DDR) and cell cycle pathways, which are critical pathways implicated
in a considerable proportion of breast tumours, for their usefulness and
ability in breast tumour subtyping. We think that subtyping breast tumours
based on these two pathways could lead to vital insights into molecular
mechanisms driving these tumours. Here, we performed a systematic evaluation of
DDR and cell-cycle pathways for subtyping of breast tumours into the five known
intrinsic subtypes. Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway showed the best
performance in subtyping breast tumours, indicating that HR genes are strongly
involved in all breast tumours. Comparisons of pathway based signatures and two
standard gene signatures supported the use of known pathways for breast tumour
subtyping. Further, the evaluation of these standard gene signatures showed
that breast tumour subtyping, prognosis and survival estimation are all closely
related. Finally, we constructed an all-inclusive super-signature by combining
(union of) all genes and performing a stringent feature selection, and found it
to be reasonably accurate and robust in classification as well as prognostic
value. Adopting DDR and cell cycle pathways for breast tumour subtyping
achieved robust and accurate breast tumour subtyping, and constructing a
super-signature which contains feature selected mix of genes from these
molecular pathways as well as clinical aspects is valuable in clinical
practice.

explosion could be intrinsically bipolar, resulting from a localized ignition

Studying the structure of novae during the earliest phases is challenging
because of the high spatial resolution needed to measure their small sizes.
Here we report near-infrared interferometric measurements of the angular size

optically thick core surrounded by a diffuse envelope. The optical depth of the

consists of a stellar disk, a bugle, and a live halo, corresponding to
Milky-Way type galaxies, while the companion is represented by a halo alone. We
vary the companion mass and the pericenter distance to explore situations with
differing tidal strength parameterized by either the relative tidal force P or
the relative imparted momentum S. We find that the formation of a tidal tail in
the outer parts requires P > 0.05 or S > 0.07. A stronger interaction results
in a stronger, less wound tail that forms earlier. Similarly, a stronger tidal
forcing produces stronger, more loosely wound spiral arms in the inner parts.
The arms are approximately logarithmic in shape, with both amplitude and pitch
angle decaying with time. The derived pattern speed decreases with radius and
is close to the Omega-kappa/2 curve at late time, with Omega and kappa denoting
the angular and epicycle frequencies, respectively. This suggests that the
tidally-induced spiral arms are most likely kinematic density waves weakly
modified by self-gravity. Compared to the razor-thin counterparts, arms in the
3D models are weaker, have a smaller pitch angle, and wind and decay more
rapidly. The 3D density structure of the arms is well described by the
concentrated and sinusoidal models when the arms are in the nonlinear and
linear regimes, respectively. We demonstrate that dynamical friction between
interacting galaxies transfers the orbital angular momentum of one galaxy to
the spin angular momentum of the companion halo.

By computing the transition matrices of the objects and the translation

compute the small separation asymptotic expansions of the Casimir interaction
energies up to the next-to-leading order terms. The leading terms coincide with
the respective results obtained using proximity force approximation, which is
of order $d^{-D+1/2}$, where $d$ is the distance between the two objects. The
results on the next-to-leading order terms are more interesting and important.
We find some universal behaviors. It is also noticed that for the case of
Dirichlet-Dirichlet cylinder-plate interaction, the next-to-leading order term
agrees with that obtained using derivative expansion. Hence, based on our
results on other boundary conditions and on the cylinder-cylinder interaction,
we postulate a formula for the derivative expansion to expand the Casimir

to realize topological quantum computation by periodic driving. Compared to the
adiabatic evolution, the total operation time can be regulated arbitrarily by
the amplitude and frequency of the periodic driving. For the sinusoidal
driving, we give an expression for the total operation time in the

introduced the concept of regular $k$-independence number, which is a natural
generalization of the regular independence number. A \emph{$k$-independent set}
is a set of vertices whose induced subgraph has maximum degree at most $k$. The
\emph{regular $k$-independence number} of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_{k-reg}(G)$,
is defined as the maximum cardinality of a $k$-independent set of $G$ in which
all vertices have equal degree in $G$. In this paper, the exact values of the
regular $k$-independence numbers of some special graphs are obtained. We also
get some lower and upper bounds for the regular $k$-independence number of
trees with given diameter, and the lower bounds for the regular
$k$-independence number of line graphs. For a simple graph $G$ of order $n$, we
show that $1\leq\alpha_{k-reg}(G)\leq n$ and characterize the extremal graphs.

take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and
introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for

different features which evolve differently with the propagation of the CME.
Simultaneous heliospheric tracking of different observed features of a CME can
improve our understanding about relative forces acting on them. It also helps
to estimate accurately their arrival times at the Earth and identify them in
in- situ data. This also enables to find association between remotely observed
features and in-situ observations near the Earth. In this paper, we attempt to
continuously track two density enhanced features, one at the front and another
at the rear edge of the 6 October 2010 CME. This is achieved by using
time-elongation maps constructed from STEREO/SECCHI observations. We derive the
kinematics of the tracked features using various reconstruction methods. The
estimated kinematics are used as inputs in the Drag Based Model (DBM) to
estimate the arrival time of the tracked features of the CME at L1. On
comparing the estimated kinematics as well as the arrival times of the remotely
observed features with in-situ observations by ACE and Wind, we find that the
tracked bright feature in the J-map at the rear edge of 6 October 2010 CME
corresponds most probably to the enhanced density structure after the magnetic
cloud detected by ACE and Wind. In-situ plasma and compositional parameters
provide evidence that the rear edge density structure may correspond to a
filament associated with the CME while the density enhancement at the front
corresponds to the leading edge of the CME. Based on this single event study,
we discuss the relevance and significance of heliospheric imager (HI)
observations in identification of the three-part structure of the CME.

  on Tuple Routing",,,,,"cs.DC cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the distribution of linked data across the web, the methods that
process federated queries through a distributed approach are more attractive to
the users and have gained more prosperity. In distributed processing of
federated queries, we need methods and procedures to execute the query in an
optimal manner. Most of the existing methods perform the optimization task
based on some statistical information, whereas the query processor does not
have precise statistical information about their properties, since the data
sources are autonomous. When precise statistics are not available, the
possibility of wrong estimations will highly increase, and may lead to
inefficient execution of the query at runtime. Another problem of the existing
methods is that in the optimization phase, they assume that runtime conditions
of query execution are stable, while the environment in which federated queries
are executed over linked data is dynamic and non-predictable. By considering
these two problems, there is a great potential for exploiting the federated
query processing techniques in an adaptive manner. In this paper, an adaptive
method is proposed for processing federated queries over linked data, based on
the concept of routing the tuples. The proposed method, named ADQUEX, is able
to execute the query effectively without any prior statistical information.
This method can change the query execution plan at runtime so that less
intermediate results are produced. It can also adapt the execution plan to new
situation if unpredicted network latencies arise. Extensive evaluation of our
method by running real queries over well-known linked datasets shows very good
results especially for complex queries.

consists of two parts: state-space mapping and state-space clustering. In
state-space mapping, it maps observations onto a finite state-space,
representing the activation states of units across conditions. In state-space
clustering, MBASIC incorporates a finite mixture model to cluster the units
based on their inferred state-space profiles across all conditions. Both the
state-space mapping and clustering can be simultaneously estimated through an
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. MBASIC flexibly adapts to a large number of
parametric distributions for the observed data, as well as the heterogeneity in
replicate experiments. In our data-driven simulation studies, MBASIC showed
significant accuracy in recovering both the underlying state-space variables

Sakai-Sugimoto model, aiming at a strong-coupling framework in the wide density
range between nuclear saturation density and ultra-high quark matter densities.
The model contains only three parameters, and we ask whether it fulfills two
basic requirements of real-world cold and dense matter, a first-order onset of
nuclear matter and a chiral phase transition at high density to quark matter.
Such a model would be extremely useful for astrophysical applications because
it would provide a single equation of state for all densities relevant in a
compact star. Our calculations are based on two approximations for baryonic
matter, firstly an instanton gas and secondly a homogeneous ansatz for the
non-abelian gauge fields on the flavor branes of the model. While the instanton
gas shows chiral restoration at high densities but an unrealistic second-order
baryon onset, the homogeneous ansatz behaves exactly the other way around. Our
study thus provides all ingredients that are necessary for a more realistic
model and allows for systematic improvements of the applied approximations.

processing tasks. However, it may suffer from the inaccurate and incomplete
information contained in the free text corpus as training data. To tackle this
challenge, there have been quite a few works that leverage knowledge graphs as
an additional information source to improve the quality of word embedding.
Although these works have achieved certain success, they have neglected some
important facts about knowledge graphs: (i) many relationships in knowledge
graphs are \emph{many-to-one}, \emph{one-to-many} or even \emph{many-to-many},
rather than simply \emph{one-to-one}; (ii) most head entities and tail entities
in knowledge graphs come from very different semantic spaces. To address these
issues, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm named ProjectNet. ProjecNet
models the relationships between head and tail entities after transforming them
with different low-rank projection matrices. The low-rank projection can allow
non \emph{one-to-one} relationships between entities, while different
projection matrices for head and tail entities allow them to originate in
different semantic spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that ProjectNet
yields more accurate word embedding than previous works, thus leads to clear
improvements in various natural language processing tasks.

  We also discuss the connection between the theory of the spectral shift

various definitions of the Witten index, (an extension of the notion of
Fredholm index to non-Fredholm operators). Then we study the model operator
$D_{A^{}} = (d/dt) + A$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H})$ associated with the
operator path $\{A(t)\}_{t=-\infty}^{\infty}$, where $(A f)(t) = A(t) f(t)$ for
a.e. $t\in\mathbb{R}$, and appropriate $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R};\mathcal{H})$. The
setup permits the operator family $A(t)$ on $\mathcal{H}$ to be an unbounded
relatively trace class perturbation of the unbounded self-adjoint operator
$A_-$, and no discrete spectrum assumptions are made on the asymptotes
$A_{\pm}$.
  When $A_{\pm}$ are boundedly invertible, it is shown that $D_{A^{}}$ is
Fredholm and its index can be computed as $\xi(0; A_+, A_-)$. When
$0\in\sigma(A_+)$ (or $0\in\sigma(A_-)$), the operator $D_{A^{}}$ ceases to be
Fredholm. However, if $0$ is a right and a left Lebesgue point of
$\xi(\,\cdot\,\, ; A_+, A_-)$, the resolvent regularized Witten index
$W_r(D_{A^{}})$ is given by $W_r(D_{A^{}}) = \xi(0_+; |D_{A^{*}}|^2,
|D_{A^{}}|^2) = [\xi(0_+; A_+,A_-) + \xi(0_-; A_+, A_-)]/2$.

region of protoplanetary disks where the ionization fraction is sufficiently
high. It has recently been shown that the electric field induced by the MRI can
heat up electrons and thereby affect the ionization balance in the gas. In
particular, in a disk where abundant dust grains are present, the electron
heating causes a reduction of the electron abundance, thereby preventing
further growth of the MRI. By using the nonlinear Ohm's law that takes into
account electron heating, we investigate where in protoplanetary disks this
negative feedback between the MRI and ionization chemistry becomes important.
We find that the ""e-heating zone,"" the region where the electron heating limits
the saturation of the MRI, extends out up to 80 AU in the minimum-mass solar
nebula with abundant submicron-sized grains. This region is considerably larger
than the conventional dead zone whose radial extent is $\sim20$ AU in the same
disk model. Scaling arguments show that the MRI turbulence in the e-heating
zone should have a significantly lower saturation level. Submicron-sized grains
in the e-heating zone are so negatively charged that their collisional growth
is unlikely to occur. Our present model neglects ambipolar and Hall diffusion,
but our estimate shows that ambipolar diffusion would also affect the MRI in
the e-heating zone.

a considerable increase of interest over the last decade. In this paper, we
argue that the the algorithm engineering methodology fits very well to the
field of robust optimization and yields a rewarding new perspective on both the
current state of research and open research directions.
  To this end we go through the algorithm engineering cycle of design and
analysis of concepts, development and implementation of algorithms, and
theoretical and experimental evaluation. We show that many ideas of algorithm
engineering have already been applied in publications on robust optimization.
Most work on robust optimization is devoted to analysis of the concepts and the
development of algorithms, some papers deal with the evaluation of a particular
concept in case studies, and work on comparison of concepts just starts. What
is still a drawback in many papers on robustness is the missing link to include
the results of the experiments again in the design.

for the purpose of sensing and reconstruction of a spatially correlated
Gaussian random field. The sensors are powered solely by energy harvested from
the environment and are deployed randomly according to a spatially
nonhomogeneous Poisson point process whose density depends on the energy
arrival statistics at different locations. Random deployment is suitable for
applications that require deployment over a wide and/or hostile area. During an
observation period, each sensor takes a local sample of the random field and
reports the data to the closest data-gathering node if sufficient energy is
available for transmission. The realization of the random field is then
reconstructed at the fusion center based on the reported sensor measurements.
For the purpose of field reconstruction, the sensors should, on the one hand,
be more spread out over the field to gather more informative samples, but
should, on the other hand, be more concentrated at locations with high energy
arrival rates or large channel gains toward the closest data-gathering node.
This tradeoff is exploited in the optimization of the random sensor deployment
in both analog and digital forwarding systems. More specifically, given the
statistics of the energy arrival at different locations and a constraint on the
average number of sensors, the spatially-dependent sensor density and the
energy-aware transmission policy at the sensors are determined for both cases
by minimizing an upper bound on the average mean-square reconstruction error.
The efficacy of the proposed schemes are demonstrated through numerical
simulations.

ability to sequence genomes, but not to assemble them. In practice, many
published genome sequences remain in the state of a large set of contigs. Each
contig describes the sequence found along some path of the assembly graph,
however, the set of contigs does not record all the sequence information
contained in that graph. Although many subsequent analyses can be performed
with the set of contigs, one may ask whether mapping reads on the contigs is as
informative as mapping them on the paths of the assembly graph. Currently, one
lacks practical tools to perform mapping on such graphs. Results Here, we
propose a formal definition of mapping on a de Bruijn graph, analyse the
problem complexity which turns out to be NP-complete, and provide a practical
solution.We propose a pipeline called GGMAP (Greedy Graph MAPping). Its novelty
is a procedure to map reads on branching paths of the graph, for which we
designed a heuristic algorithm called BGREAT (de Bruijn Graph REAd mapping
Tool). For the sake of efficiency, BGREAT rewrites a read sequence as a
succession of unitigs sequences. GGMAP can map millions of reads per CPU hour
on a de Bruijn graph built from a large set of human genomic reads.
Surprisingly, results show that up to 22% more reads can be mapped on the graph
but not on the contig set. Conclusions Although mapping reads on a de Bruijn
graph is complex task, our proposal offers a practical solution combining
efficiency with an improved mapping capacity compared to assembly-based mapping
even for complex eukaryotic data. Availability: github.com/Malfoy/BGREAT

Cubicity is a variant of boxicity, where the axis parallel boxes in the

whether boxicity (resp. cubicity) of a graph is at most k is NP-hard, even for

superconductor is protected against interband scattering and, thus, more robust
than the conventional condensate. In case of nonmagnetic impurities, the
conventional superconductor is protected as expected from the Anderson theorem
and the critical scattering rate of the unconventional state is enhanced by a
factor of four due to the spin-orbit coupling and anisotropic masses in oxide

rarely exhibit unanimous behavior, or consensus. This requires a development of
mathematical models that are sufficiently simple to be examined and capture, at
the same time, the complex behavior of real social groups, where opinions and
actions related to them may form clusters of different size. One such model,
proposed by Friedkin and Johnsen, extends the idea of conventional consensus
algorithm (also referred to as the iterative opinion pooling) to take into
account the actors' prejudices, caused by some exogenous factors and leading to
disagreement in the final opinions.
  In this paper, we offer a novel multidimensional extension, describing the
evolution of the agents' opinions on several topics. Unlike the existing
models, these topics are interdependent, and hence the opinions being formed on
these topics are also mutually dependent. We rigorous examine stability
properties of the proposed model, in particular, convergence of the agents'
opinions. Although our model assumes synchronous communication among the
agents, we show that the same final opinions may be reached ""on average"" via
asynchronous gossip-based protocols.

supergravity which can predict values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the
order of few times 0.01. For the parameters considered, the underlying
supersymmetric particle physics model possesses two inflationary paths, the
trivial and the semi-shifted one. The trivial path is stabilized by
supergravity corrections and supports a first stage of inflation with a limited
number of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio can become appreciable while
the value of the scalar spectral index remains acceptable as a result of the
competition between the relatively mild supergravity corrections and the strong
radiative corrections to the inflationary potential. The additional number of
e-foldings required for solving the puzzles of hot big bang cosmology are
generated by a second stage of inflation taking place along the semi-shifted
path. This is possible only because the semi-shifted path is almost
perpendicular to the trivial one and, thus, not affected by the strong
radiative corrections along the trivial path and also because the supergravity
effects remain mild. The requirement that the running of the scalar spectral
index remains acceptable limits the possible values of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio not to exceed about 0.05. Our model predicts the formation of an unstable
string-monopole network, which may lead to detectable gravity wave signatures

limited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing
low-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are
based on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using generated

centers. In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google
dataset collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and
evaluating a predictive model for node failures. We use BigQuery, the big data

describe how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest

allowing the order flow intensities to depend on the order book state.
Furthermore, contrary to most existing models, the impact of the order book
updates on the reference price dynamics is not assumed to be instantaneous. We

radial profile of the PI is reproduced by a minimally flaring disk with an

density in the inner power-law region (r< 50 AU) is derived to be <= 0.16 from

asymmetries in the outer power-law region. Possible origins for these
asymmetries include corrugation of the scattering surface in the outer region,
and shadowing effect by a puffed up structure in the inner power-law region.

most appropriate measure of time regularity of an optical flow field. Instead,
for a given velocity field $v$ we consider the convective acceleration $v_t +
\nabla v v$ which describes the acceleration of objects moving according to
$v$. Consequently we investigate the suitability of the nonconvex functional
$\|v_t + \nabla v v\|^2_{L^2}$ as a regularization term for optical flow. We
demonstrate that this term acts as both a spatial and a temporal regularizer
and has an intrinsic edge-preserving property. We incorporate it into a
contrast invariant and time-regularized variant of the Horn-Schunck functional,
prove existence of minimizers and verify experimentally that it addresses some
of the problems of basic quadratic models. For the minimization we use an
iterative scheme that approximates the original nonlinear problem with a
sequence of linear ones. We believe that the convective acceleration may be
gainfully introduced in a variety of optical flow models.

observable imprints they leave at different wavelengths, and the methods used
to uncover them in a statistically robust way. I will show how such a combined

scale-setting uncertainties using fundamental renormalization group methods.
The resulting scale-fixed pQCD predictions are independent of the choice of
renormalization scheme and show rapid convergence. The coefficients of the
scale-fixed couplings are identical to the corresponding conformal series with
zero $\beta$-function. Two all-orders methods for systematically implementing
the PMC-scale setting procedure for existing high order calculations are
discussed in this article. One implementation is based on the PMC-BLM
correspondence \mbox{(PMC-I)}; the other, more recent, method \mbox{(PMC-II)}
uses the ${\cal R}_\delta$-scheme, a systematic generalization of the minimal
subtraction renormalization scheme. Both approaches satisfy all of the
principles of the renormalization group and lead to scale-fixed and
scheme-independent predictions at each finite order. In this work, we show that
PMC-I and PMC-II scale-setting methods are in practice equivalent to each
other. We illustrate this equivalence for the four-loop calculations of the
annihilation ratio $R_{e^+ e^-}$ and the Higgs partial width $\Gamma(H\to
b\bar{b})$. Both methods lead to the same resummed (`conformal') series up to
all orders. The small scale differences between the two approaches are reduced
as additional renormalization group $\{\beta_i\}$-terms in the pQCD expansion
are taken into account. We also show that {\it special degeneracy relations},
which underly the equivalence of the two PMC approaches and the resulting
conformal features of the pQCD series, are in fact general properties of

represent the relation between covariates and response variables as the sum of
low-dimensional transfer functions. Besides flexibility and accuracy, a key
benefit of these models is their interpretability: the transfer functions
provide visual means for inspecting the models and identifying domain-specific
relations between inputs and outputs. However, in large-scale problems
involving the prediction of many related tasks, learning independently additive
models results in a loss of model interpretability, and can cause overfitting
when training data is scarce. We introduce a novel multi-task learning approach
which provides a corpus of accurate and interpretable additive models for a
large number of related forecasting tasks. Our key idea is to share transfer
functions across models in order to reduce the model complexity and ease the
exploration of the corpus. We establish a connection with sparse dictionary
learning and propose a new efficient fitting algorithm which alternates between
sparse coding and transfer function updates. The former step is solved via an
extension of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, whose properties are analyzed using a
novel recovery condition which extends existing results in the literature. The
latter step is addressed using a traditional dictionary update rule.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach compares favorably
to baseline methods while yielding an interpretable corpus of models, revealing
structure among the individual tasks and being more robust when training data
is scarce. Our framework therefore extends the well-known benefits of additive
models to common regression settings possibly involving thousands of tasks.

of bond making in multi-photon femtosecond photoassociation of hot magnesium

detected yield of photoassociated magnesium dimers was enhanced by positively
chirped pulses which is explained theoretically by a combination of
purification and chirp-dependent Raman transitions. The yield could be further
enhanced by pulse optimization resulting in pulses with an effective linear
chirp and a sub-pulse structure, where the latter allows for exploiting
vibrational coherences. Here, we systematically explore the efficiency of
phase-shaped pulses for the coherent control of bond making, employing a
parametrization of the spectral phases in the form of cosine functions. We find
up to an order of magnitude enhancement of the yield compared to the unshaped
transform-limited pulse. The highly performing pulses all display an overall
temporally increasing instantaneous frequency and are composed of several
overlapping sub-pulses. The time delay between the first two sub-pulses almost

efficient mode of star formation is occurring at high-redshift. To address this
issue, we measure the molecular gas content of seven high-redshift (z ~ 1.6)
starburst galaxies with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array and
IRAM/Plateau de Bure Interferometer. Our targets are selected from the sample
of Herschel far-infrared detected galaxies having star formation rates

included in the FMOS-COSMOS near-infrared spectroscopic survey of star-forming
galaxies at z ~ 1.6 with Subaru. We detect CO emission in all cases at high
levels of significance, indicative of high gas fractions (~30-50%). Even more
compelling, we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection that
starbursts, identified as main-sequence outliers, at high redshift generally
have a lower ratio of CO to total infrared luminosity as compared to typical
main-sequence star-forming galaxies, although with a smaller offset than
expected based on past studies of local starbursts. We put forward a hypothesis
that there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency with
elevation from the main sequence with galaxy mergers as a possible physical
driver. Along with a heightened star formation efficiency, our high-redshift
sample is similar in other respects to local starbursts such as being metal
rich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium.

has the same form as in general relativity (GR), except that the cosmological

integral differs from the one of GR in two ways: the metric of spacetime
satisfies the unimodular condition only in average over space, and both the
Hamiltonian constraint and the associated gauge condition have zero average
over space. Finally, the canonical relation between the given unimodular

its capacity-achieving performance and low encoding and decoding complexity.
Successive cancellation decoding (SCD) and belief propagation decoding (BPD)
are two of the most popular approaches for decoding polar codes. SCD is able to
achieve good error-correcting performance and is less computationally expensive
as compared to BPD. However SCDs suffer from long latency and low throughput
due to the serial nature of the successive cancellation algorithm. BPD is
parallel in nature and hence is more attractive for high throughput
applications. However since it is iterative in nature, the required latency and
energy dissipation increases linearly with the number of iterations. In this
work, we borrow the idea of SCD and propose a novel scheme based on
sub-factor-graph freezing to reduce the average number of computations as well
as the average number of iterations required by BPD, which directly translates
into lower latency and energy dissipation. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme has no performance degradation and achieves significant
reduction in computation complexity over the existing methods.

two concepts with the aim of investigating the combination problem of concepts.
Our experiments confirmed the deviations (conceptual vagueness, underextension,
overextension, etc.) from the rules of classical (fuzzy) logic and probability
theory observed by several scholars in concept theory, while our data were
successfully modeled in a quantum-theoretic framework developed by ourselves.
In this paper, we isolate a new, very stable and systematic pattern of
violation of classicality that occurs in concept combinations. In addition, the
strength and regularity of this non-classical effect leads us to believe that
it occurs at a more fundamental level than the deviations observed up to now.
It is our opinion that we have identified a deep non-classical mechanism
determining not only how concepts are combined but, rather, how they are
formed. We show that this effect can be faithfully modeled in a two-sector Fock
space structure, and that it can be exactly explained by assuming that human
thought is the supersposition of two processes, a 'logical reasoning', guided
by 'logic', and a 'conceptual reasoning' guided by 'emergence', and that the
latter generally prevails over the former. All these findings provide a new
fundamental support to our quantum-theoretic approach to human cognition.

mechanisms from a simple mono-frequency laser pulse to involved combination of
pulses as used, e.g., in attosecond experiments. In the case of simple pulses,
the peaks in PES re- flect the occupied single-particle levels in combination
with the given laser frequency. This usual, simple rule may badly fail in the
case of excitation pulses with mixed frequencies and if resonant modes of the
system are significantly excited. We thus develop an extension of the usual
rule to cover all possible excitation scenarios, including mixed frequencies in
the attosecond regime. We find that the spectral dis- tributions of dipole,
monopole and quadrupole power for the given excitation taken together and
properly shifted by the single-particle energies provide a pertinent picture of
the PES in all situations. This leads to the derivation of a generalized
relation allowing to understand photo-electron yields even in complex
experimental setups.

regret bounds under log-loss, which show how certain hierarchical models
compare, in retrospect, to the best single model in the model class. We also
show how to convert a Bayesian log-loss regret bound into a Bayesian risk bound

in evolutionary biology and social science. The public goods game (PGG) is a
paradigm for exploring cooperative behavior. In PGG, the total resulting payoff
is divided equally among all participants. This feature still leads to the
dominance of defection without substantially magnifying the public good by a
multiplying factor. Much effort has been made to explain the evolution of
cooperative strategies, including a recent model in which only a portion of the
total benefit is shared by all the players through introducing a new strategy
named persistent cooperation. A persistent cooperator is a contributor who is
willing to pay a second cost to retrieve the remaining portion of the payoff
contributed by themselves. In a previous study, this model was analyzed in the
framework of well-mixed populations. This paper focuses on discussing the
persistent cooperation in lattice-structured populations. The evolutionary
dynamics of the structured populations consisting of three types of competing
players (pure cooperators, defectors and persistent cooperators) are revealed
by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In particular, the
approximate expressions of fixation probabilities for strategies are derived on
one-dimensional lattices. The phase diagrams of stationary states, the
evolution of frequencies and spatial patterns for strategies are illustrated on
both one-dimensional and square lattices by simulations. Our results are
consistent with the general observation that, at least in most situations, a
structured population facilitates the evolution of cooperation. Specifically,
here we find that the existence of persistent cooperators greatly suppresses
the spreading of defectors under more relaxed conditions in structured
populations compared to that obtained in well-mixed population.

Computations are performed in the n-dimensional single-excitation subspace

not scalable, but allows many operations in the unitary group SU(n) to be
implemented by a single application of the Hamiltonian, bypassing the need to
decompose a desired unitary into elementary gates. This feature makes large,
nontrivial quantum computations possible within the available coherence time.
We show how to use a programmable SES chip to perform fast amplitude
amplification and phase estimation, two versatile quantum subalgorithms. We
also show that an SES processor is well suited for Hamiltonian simulation,
specifically simulation of the Schrodinger equation with a real but otherwise

such a universal quantum simulator, and propose its application to the study of

N(H2) > 17. This is in contrast with lines of sight towards nearby stars, where
such H2 column densities are always detected as soon as log N(HI)>20.7. This
can qualitatively be explained by the lower average metallicity and possibly
higher surrounding UV radiation in DLAs. However, unlike in the Milky Way, the
overall molecular fractions remain modest, showing that even at a large N(HI)
only a small fraction of overall HI is actually associated with the
self-shielded H2 gas. Damped Lyman-alpha systems with very high-N(HI) probably
arise along quasar lines of sight passing closer to the centre of the host

acoustic solitary waves and double layers in an unmagnetized collisionless
dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static dust grains, adiabatic
warm ions, and isothermally distributed electrons and positrons. A
computational scheme has been developed to draw the qualitatively different
compositional parameter spaces or solution spaces showing the nature of
existence of different solitary structures with respect to any parameter of the
present plasma system. The qualitatively distinct solution spaces give the
overall scenario regarding the existence of different solitary structures. The
present system supports both positive and negative potential double layers. The
negative potential double layer always restricts the occurrence of negative
potential solitary waves, i.e., any sequence of negative potential solitary
waves having monotonically increasing amplitude converges to a negative
potential double layer. However, there exists a parameter regime for which the
positive potential double layer is unable to restrict the occurrence of
positive potential solitary waves. As a result, in this region of the parameter
space, there exist solitary waves after the formation of positive potential
double layer, i.e., positive potential supersolitons have been observed. But
the amplitudes of these supersolitons are bounded. A general theory for the
existence of bounded supersolitons has been discussed analytically by imposing
the restrictions on the Mach number. For any small value of positron
concentration, there is no effect of very hot positrons on the dust ion
acoustic solitary structures. The qualitatively different solution spaces are
capable of producing new results for the formation of solitary structures.

to sizes that require dedicated methods for finding relevant data. To improve
on the state of the art of keyword searches from annotations, methods for
content-based retrieval have been proposed. In the context of gene expression
experiments, most methods retrieve gene expression profiles, requiring each
experiment to be expressed as a single profile, typically of case vs. control.
A more general, recently suggested alternative is to retrieve experiments whose
models are good for modelling the query dataset. However, for very noisy and
high-dimensional query data, this retrieval criterion turns out to be very
noisy as well.
  Results: We propose doing retrieval using a denoised model of the query
dataset, instead of the original noisy dataset itself. To this end, we
introduce a general probabilistic framework, where each experiment is modelled
separately and the retrieval is done by finding related models. For retrieval
of gene expression experiments, we use a probabilistic model called product
partition model, which induces a clustering of genes that show similar
expression patterns across a number of samples. The suggested metric for
retrieval using clusterings is the normalized information distance. Empirical
results finally suggest that inference for the full probabilistic model can be
approximated with good performance using computationally faster heuristic
clustering approaches (e.g. $k$-means). The method is highly scalable and
straightforward to apply to construct a general-purpose gene expression
experiment retrieval method.
  Availability: The method can be implemented using standard clustering
algorithms and normalized information distance, available in many statistical
software packages.

hyperparameters, and without any handcrafted features. For the HAREM I corpus,
CharWNN outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 7.9 points in the F1-score

nucleon-nucleon interaction. Within the deformed density-dependent cluster
model, the penetration probability and the assault frequency are calculated
using the WKB penetration probability. The deformations of daughter nuclei and
the ground-state spin and parity of the involved nuclei are considered. We
found that it is accurate enough to express the assault frequency, for all
studied decays, either as a function of the mass number of the parent nuclei or
as a constant average value. The average preformation probability of the Alpha
cluster inside four groups of 166 even(Z)-even(N), 117 odd-even, 141 even-odd,
and 72 odd-odd Alpha-emitters are obtained, individually. The effect of
participating unpaired nucleons in the involved nuclei, as well as the
influence of any differences in their ground-state spin and/or parity, appears
in the obtained average values of the preformation probability. Based on the
calculated WKB penetration probability, we suggested a single universal curve
for Alpha decay, with only one parameter. This parameter varies according to
the classified four groups. It includes the preformation probability and the
average assault frequency, in addition to the pairing contribution.

interest both for their wide applicability and because of their interesting
mathematical properties. It is known that under the property of
quasimonotonicity time-delayed systems become monotone, and some remarkable
properties have been reported for such systems. These include, for example, the
fact that for linear systems global asymptotic stability of the undelayed
system implies global asymptotic stability for the delayed system under
arbitrary bounded delays. Nevertheless, extensions to nonlinear systems have
thus far relied primarily on the conditions of homogeneity and subhomogeneity,
and it has been conjectured that these can be relaxed. Our aim in this paper is
to show that this is feasible for a general class of nonlinear monotone systems
by deriving convergence results in which simple properties of the undelayed
system lead to delay-independent stability. In particular, one of our results
shows that if the undelayed system has a convergent trajectory that is
unbounded in all components as $t \to -\infty$, then the system is globally
asymptotically stable for arbitrary bounded time-varying delays. This follows
from a more general result derived in the paper that allows to quantify
delay-independent regions of attraction, which can be used to prove global
asymptotic stability for various classes of systems. These also recover various
known delay-independent stability results that are discussed within the paper.

positive, then the optimal control action is concentrated at the beginning and
at the end of the time interval, and in-between it decays exponentially. We
show that the optimal control can actually be written in that case as the sum
of an exponentially decaying term and of an exponentially increasing term. This
implies that, if the time T is large the optimal trajectory approximately
consists of three arcs, where the first and the third short-time arcs are
transient arcs, and in the middle arc the optimal control and the corresponding
state are exponentially close to 0. This is an example for a turnpike
phenomenon for a problem of optimal boundary control. If T = +$\infty$

of the control remains, and the norms of the optimal control action and of the
optimal state decay exponentially in time. In contrast to this situation if the

then the optimal control is distributed uniformly along the whole interval [0,

general quantization procedure, which should be applicable whether or not the
theory explicitly introduces a preferred frame. Based on this scheme we
evaluate the power spectrum of quantum vacuum fluctuations. We find that in
{\it all} theories which run to 2 dimensions in the ultraviolet the vacuum
fluctuations, in the ultraviolet regime, are scale-invariant. This is true in
flat space but also for ""inside the horizon"" modes in an expanding universe. We
spell out the conditions upon the gravity theory for this scale-invariance to
be preserved as the modes are frozen-in outside the horizon. We also digress on

methodology of its use. It is based on the approach of Gelfond and Lifschitz
(1993; 1998) in which a high-level action language is used as a front end for a
logic programming system description. The resulting logic programming
representation is used to perform various computational tasks. The methodology
based on existing action languages works well for small and even medium size
systems, but is not meant to deal with larger systems that require structuring
of knowledge. ALM is meant to remedy this problem. Structuring of knowledge in
ALM is supported by the concepts of module (a formal description of a specific
piece of knowledge packaged as a unit), module hierarchy, and library, and by
the division of a system description of ALM into two parts: theory and
structure. A theory consists of one or more modules with a common theme,
possibly organized into a module hierarchy based on a dependency relation. It
contains declarations of sorts, attributes, and properties of the domain
together with axioms describing them. Structures are used to describe the
domain's objects. These features, together with the means for defining classes
of a domain as special cases of previously defined ones, facilitate the
stepwise development, testing, and readability of a knowledge base, as well as
the creation of knowledge representation libraries. To appear in Theory and

controls the {\mu} term in the minimal supersymmetric standard model is
compatible with GUT. We find that the symmetry must be broken at the GUT scale.
A similar argument also shows that the R symmetry, which is important for low
energy supersymmetry, must be broken down to a Z2R symmetry at the GUT scale.
We propose a new prescription to achieve the doublet-triplet splitting by
symmetry. There, the symmetry which controls the {\mu} term is spontaneously
broken at the GUT scale by order parameters which are charged under other
symmetries. Bilinear terms of triplet Higgses are charged under the other
symmetries, while those of doublet Higgses are not. Then triplet Higgses
directly couple to the order parameters and hence obtain GUT scale masses,
while doublet Higgses obtain suppressed masses. The broken R symmetry can be
also effectively preserved by a similar prescription. As a demonstration, we
construct an SU(5)$\times$SU(5) GUT model. We also comment on unification of
yukawa couplings.

quantum formalism. Many attempts to solve (or to dissolve) it have been made
since the inception of quantum mechanics. The form of these attempts depends on
the philosophical position that their authors endorse. I will review some of
them and analyze their relevance. The phenomenon of decoherence is often
presented as a solution lying inside the pure quantum formalism and not
demanding any particular philosophical assumption. Nevertheless, a widely
debated question is to decide between two different interpretations. The first
one is to consider that the decoherence process has the effect to actually
project a superposed state into one of its classically interpretable component,
hence doing the same job as the reduction postulate. For the second one,
decoherence is only a way to show why no macroscopic superposed state can be
observed, so explaining the classical appearance of the macroscopic world,
while the quantum entanglement between the system, the apparatus and the
environment never disappears. In this case, explaining why only one single
definite outcome is observed remains to do. In this paper, I examine the
arguments that have been given for and against both interpretations and defend
a new position, the ""Convivial Solipsism"" , according to which the outcome that
is observed is relative to the observer, different but in close parallel to the
Everett's interpretation and sharing also some similarities with Rovelli's
relational interpretation and quantum bayesianism. I also show how ""Convivial
Solipsism"" can help getting a new standpoint about the EPR paradox providing a
way out of the standard dilemma that is having to choose between abandoning
either realism or locality.

a modular version of the algorithm which first computes a number of the

of the interstellar medium and the solar wind is of great importance due to the
variety of applications of the resulting diffusion coefficients. Examples are
diffusive shock acceleration, cosmic-ray observations, and, in the solar
system, the propagation of coronal mass ejections. In recent years, it was
found that the simple diffusive motion that had been assumed for decades is
often in disagreement both with numerical and observational results. Here, an
overview is given of the interaction processes of cosmic rays and turbulent
electromagnetic fields. First, the formation of turbulent fields due to plasma
instabilities is treated, where especially the non-linear behavior of the
resulting unstable wave modes is discussed. Second, the analytical and the
numerical side of high-energy particle propagation will be reviewed by
presenting non-linear analytical theories and Monte-Carlo simulations. For the
example of the solar wind, the impact of anisotropic and dynamical turbulence
models will be discussed. In addition, it will be shown how further
complications can be treated that arise from the large-scale magnetic field
geometry and turbulent electric fields. The transport properties of energetic
particles can thus be calculated for current turbulence models so that they
withstand a comparison with measurements taken in the solar wind.

  functionals: spin channel",,,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been recently shown, that some Skyrme functionals can lead to
non-converging results in the calculation of some properties of atomic nuclei.
A previous study has pointed out a possible link between these convergence
problems and the appearance of finite-size instabilities in symmetric nuclear
matter (SNM) around saturation density.
  We show that the finite-size instabilities not only affect the ground state
properties of atomic nuclei, but they can also influence the calculations of
vibrational excited states in finite nuclei. We perform systematic fully-self
consistent Random Phase Approximation (RPA) calculations in spherical
doubly-magic nuclei. We employ several Skyrme functionals and vary the
isoscalar and isovector coupling constants of the time-odd term
$\mathbf{s}\cdot \Delta \mathbf{s}$ . We determine critical values of these
coupling constants beyond which the RPA calculations do not converge because
RPA the stability matrix becomes non-positive.By comparing the RPA calculations
of atomic nuclei with those performed for SNM we establish a correspondence
between the critical densities in the infinite system and the critical coupling
constants for which the RPA calculations do not converge. We find a
quantitative stability criterion to detect finite-size instabilities related to
the spin $\mathbf{s}\cdot \Delta \mathbf{s}$ term of a functional. This
criterion could be easily implemented into the standard fitting protocols to
fix the coupling constants of the Skyrme functional.

factors corresponding to conjugacy classes of Puiseux expansions, without
actually computing the individual expansions. In this way, we make
substantially less use of the Newton-Puiseux algorithm. In addition, our
algorithm is inherently parallel. As a result, it outperforms in most cases any

the parametrization of rational curves.

most favourable scheme relies on a self-adjoint local dG (LDG) discretization

arbitrary order. The pollution by numerical perpendicular heat fluxes degrades
with superconvergence rates. We compare this scheme with aligned schemes that
are based on the flux-coordinate independent approach for the discretization of
parallel derivatives. Here, the dG method provides the necessary interpolation.
The first aligned discretization can be used in an explicit time-integrator.
However, the scheme violates conservation of energy and shows up stagnating
convergence rates for very high resolutions. We overcome this partly by using
the adjoint of the parallel derivative operator to construct a second
self-adjoint aligned scheme. This scheme preserves energy, but reveals
unphysical oscillations in the numerical tests, which result in a decreased
order of convergence. Both aligned schemes exhibit low numerical heat fluxes
into the perpendicular direction. We build our argumentation on various

field, which is closed by a comparison to the aligned finite difference (FD)

(1980) of the relationship between Moore-Yamasaki-Kharazishvili type measures
and infinite powers of Borel diffused probability measures on ${\bf R}$. More
precisely, we give Yamasaki's proof that no infinite power of the Borel
probability measure with a strictly positive density function on $R$ has an
equivalent Moore-Yamasaki-Kharazishvili type measure. A certain modification of
Yamasaki's example is used for the construction of such a
Moore-Yamasaki-Kharazishvili type measure that is equivalent to the product of
a certain infinite family of Borel probability measures with a strictly
positive density function on $R$. By virtue of the properties of
equidistributed sequences on the real axis, it is demonstrated that an
arbitrary family of infinite powers of Borel diffused probability measures with
strictly positive density functions on $R$ is strongly separated and,
accordingly, has an infinite-sample well-founded estimator of the unknown
distribution function. This extends the main result established in [ Zerakidze

  Analysis and Machine Intelligence in a better resolution",,"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2430319",,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes a novel framework for computing geodesic paths in shape
spaces of spherical surfaces under an elastic Riemannian metric. The novelty
lies in defining this Riemannian metric directly on the quotient (shape) space,
rather than inheriting it from pre-shape space, and using it to formulate a
path energy that measures only the normal components of velocities along the
path. In other words, this paper defines and solves for geodesics directly on
the shape space and avoids complications resulting from the quotient operation.
This comprehensive framework is invariant to arbitrary parameterizations of
surfaces along paths, a phenomenon termed as gauge invariance. Additionally,
this paper makes a link between different elastic metrics used in the computer
science literature on one hand, and the mathematical literature on the other
hand, and provides a geometrical interpretation of the terms involved. Examples
using real and simulated 3D objects are provided to help illustrate the main
ideas.

$1D$ Poisson-Voronoi tessellation. We employed two approaches and in both
cases, within the numerical error, no differences have been detected between
the irrational fractional digits and an equivalent random sequence of digits.
The number of tested digits is $1.6 \times 10^7$ and $4 \times 10^7$ for the
first and second approach, respectively. Although not shown here, we
investigated several irrational numbers and all of them have displayed a
similar behavior.

particles and energy and their fluxes of all orders, with the motion described
by a set of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations involving them.
These Maxwell Times have a fundamental role in determining the type of
hydrodynamic motion that the system would display in the given condition and
constraints. The different types of motion are well described by contractions
of the full description done in terms of a reduced number of fluxes up to a

crystal is studied. The medium consists in a structured fluid, formed by a
periodic array of fluid layers with alternating linear acoustic properties and
quadratic nonlinearity coefficient. The spacing between layers is of the order
of the wavelength, therefore Bragg effects such as band-gaps appear. We show
that the interplay between strong dispersion and nonlinearity leads to new
scenarios of wave propagation. The classical waveform distortion process
typical of intense acoustic waves in homogeneous media can be strongly altered
when nonlinearly generated harmonics lie inside or close to band gaps. This
allows the possibility of engineer a medium in order to get a particular
waveform. Examples of this include the design of media with effective (e.g.
cubic) nonlinearities, or extremely linear media (where distortion can be
cancelled). The presented ideas open a way towards the control of acoustic wave
propagation in nonlinear regime.
