interoperability across large collections of data of these different data

hierarchical tile and pixel structure to describe and organise astronomical
data. HiPS is designed to conserve the scientific properties of the data
alongside both visualisation considerations and emphasis on the ease of
implementation. We describe the development of HiPS to manage a large number of
diverse image surveys, as well as the extension of hierarchical image systems
to cube and catalogue data. We demonstrate the interoperability of HiPS and
Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) maps and highlight the HiPS mechanism to provide
links to the original data. Results. Hierarchical progressive surveys have been
generated by various data centres and groups for ~200 data collections
including many wide area sky surveys, and archives of pointed observations.
These can be accessed and visualised in Aladin, Aladin Lite, and other
applications. HiPS provides a basis for further innovations in the use of
hierarchical data structures to facilitate the description and statistical

required sample complexity, the estimation error decreases as
$\frac{c}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $c$ depends on the Gaussian width of the unit norm

allowing for uncertainties in the distance estimates. We also perform a
homogeneous model atmosphere analysis of this 40 pc sample and find a large
fraction of massive white dwarfs, indicating that we are successfully
recovering the more massive, and less luminous objects often missed in other
surveys. We also show that the 40 pc sample is dominated by cool and old white
dwarfs, which populate the faint end of the luminosity function, although
trigonometric parallaxes will be needed to shape this part of the luminosity
function more accurately. Finally, we identify 4 probable members of the 20 pc

of correctness properties of linked data structures. While there are many
techniques for checking that a heap-manipulating program adheres to its
specification, they often require that the programmer annotate the behavior of
each procedure, for example, in the form of loop invariants and pre- and
post-conditions. Predicate abstraction would be an attractive abstract domain
for performing invariant inference, existing techniques are not able to reason
about the heap with enough precision to verify functional properties of data
structure manipulating programs. In this paper, we propose a technique that
lifts predicate abstraction to the heap by factoring the analysis of data
structures into two orthogonal components: (1) Alias Types, which reason about
the physical shape of heap structures, and (2) Refinement Types, which use
simple predicates from an SMT decidable theory to capture the logical or
semantic properties of the structures. We prove ART sound by translating types
into separation logic assertions, thus translating typing derivations in ART
into separation logic proofs. We evaluate ART by implementing a tool that
performs type inference for an imperative language, and empirically show, using
a suite of data-structure benchmarks, that ART requires only 21% of the
annotations needed by other state-of-the-art verification techniques.

edge-transitive, but is not arc-transitive. If such a graph has finite valency,
then its valency is even, and greater than $2$. In 1970, Bouwer proved that
there exists a half-arc-transitive graph of every even valency greater than 2,
by giving a construction for a family of graphs now known as $B(k,m,n)$,
defined for every triple $(k,m,n)$ of integers greater than $1$ with $2^m
\equiv 1 \mod n$. In each case, $B(k,m,n)$ is a $2k$-valent vertex- and
edge-transitive graph of order $mn^{k-1}$, and Bouwer showed that $B(k,6,9)$ is
half-arc-transitive for all $k > 1$.
  For almost 45 years the question of exactly which of Bouwer's graphs are
half-arc-transitive and which are arc-transitive has remained open, despite
many attempts to answer it. In this paper, we use a cycle-counting argument to
prove that almost all of the graphs constructed by Bouwer are
half-arc-transitive. In fact, we prove that $B(k,m,n)$ is arc-transitive only
when $n = 3$, or $(k,n) = (2,5)$, % and $m$ is a multiple of $4$, or $(k,m,n) =
(2,3,7)$ or $(2,6,7)$ or $(2,6,21)$. In particular, $B(k,m,n)$ is
half-arc-transitive whenever $m > 6$ and $n > 5$. This gives an easy way to
prove that there are infinitely many half-arc-transitive graphs of each even
valency $2k > 2$.

failure of any one of them could have dramatic negative consequences for the
global economy and is based on ""their size, complexity, and systemic

analysis, less attention has been paid to measures of a firm's ""complexity."" In
this paper we take on the challenges of measuring the complexity of a financial
institution and to that end explore the use of the structure of an individual
firm's control hierarchy as a proxy for institutional complexity. The control
hierarchy is a network representation of the institution and its subsidiaries.
We show that this mathematical representation (and various associated metrics)
provides a consistent way to compare the complexity of firms with often very
disparate business models and as such may provide the foundation for
determining a SIFI designation. By quantifying the level of complexity of a
firm, our approach also may prove useful should firms need to reduce their
level of complexity either in response to business or regulatory needs. Using a
data set containing the control hierarchies of many of the designated SIFIs, we
find that in the past two years, these firms have decreased their level of
complexity, perhaps in response to regulatory requirements.

a finite alphabet $A$ admitting a prefixal factorization, i.e., a factorization
$x= U_0 U_1U_2 \cdots $ where each $U_i$ is a non-empty prefix of $x.$ With
each $x\in {\cal P}_1$ one naturally associates a ""derived"" infinite word
$\delta(x)$ which may or may not admit a prefixal factorization. We are
interested in the class ${\cal P}_{\infty}$ of all words $x$ of ${\cal P}_1$
such that $\delta^n(x) \in {\cal P}_1$ for all $n\geq 1$. Our primary
motivation for studying the class ${\cal P}_{\infty}$ stems from its connection
to a coloring problem on infinite words independently posed by T. Brown in
\cite{BTC} and by the second author in \cite{LQZ}. More precisely, let ${\bf
P}$ be the class of all words $x\in A^\omega$ such that for every finite
coloring $\varphi : A^+ \rightarrow C$ there exist $c\in C$ and a factorization
$x= V_0V_1V_2\cdots $ with $\varphi(V_i)=c$ for each $i\geq 0.$ In \cite{DPZ}
we conjectured that a word $x\in {\bf P}$ if and only if $x$ is purely
periodic. In this paper we show that ${\bf P}\subseteq {\cal P}_{\infty},$ so
in other words, potential candidates to a counter-example to our conjecture are
amongst the non-periodic elements of ${\cal P}_{\infty}.$ We establish several
results on the class ${\cal P}_{\infty}$. In particular, we show that a
Sturmian word $x$ belongs to ${\cal P}_{\infty}$ if and only if $x$ is
nonsingular, i.e., no proper suffix of $x$ is a standard Sturmian word.

  Cellular Networks","Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI cs.SI math.IT math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has recently been observed that the SIR distributions of a variety of
cellular network models and transmission techniques look very similar in shape.
As a result, they are well approximated by a simple horizontal shift (or gain)
of the distribution of the most tractable model, the Poisson point process
(PPP). To study and explain this behavior, this paper focuses on general
single-tier network models with nearest-base station association and studies
the asymptotic gain both at 0 and at infinity.
  We show that the gain at 0 is determined by the so-called mean
interference-to-signal ratio (MISR) between the PPP and the network model under
consideration, while the gain at infinity is determined by the expected
fading-to-interference ratio (EFIR).
  The analysis of the MISR is based on a novel type of point process, the
so-called relative distance process, which is a one-dimensional point process
on the unit interval [0,1] that fully determines the SIR. A comparison of the
gains at 0 and infinity shows that the gain at 0 indeed provides an excellent
approximation for the entire SIR distribution. Moreover, the gain is mostly a
function of the network geometry and barely depends on the path loss exponent
and the fading. The results are illustrated using several examples of repulsive
point processes.

theory. The main objects are ""minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets"", short
""MUs"", unsatisfiable conjunctive normal forms rendered satisfiable by
elimination of any clause. In other words, irredundant coverings of the boolean
hypercube by subcubes. The main parameter for MUs is the ""deficiency"" k, the
difference between the number of clauses and the number of variables (the
difference between the number of elements in the covering and the dimension of
the hypercube), and the fundamental fact is that k >= 1 holds.
  A ""full clause"" in an MU contains all variables (corresponding to a singleton
in the covering). We show the lower bound S_2(k) <= FCM(k), where FCM(k) is the
maximal number of full clauses in MUs of deficiency k, while S_2(k) is the
smallest n such that 2^k divides n!.
  The proof rests on two methods: On the logic-combinatorial side, applying
subsumption resolution and its inverse, a fundamental method since Boole in
1854 introduced the ""expansion method"". On the arithmetical side, analysing
certain recursions, combining an application-specific recursion with a
recursion from the field of meta-Fibonacci sequences (indeed S_2 equals twice
the Conolly sequence).
  A further tool is the consideration of unsatisfiable ""hitting clause-sets""
(UHITs), special cases of MUs, which correspond to the partitions of the
boolean hypercube by subcubes; they are also known as orthogonal or disjoint
DNF tautologies. We actually show the sharper lower bound S_2(k) <= FCH(k),
where FCH(k) is the maximal number of full clauses in UHITs of deficiency k. We
conjecture that for all k holds S_2(k) = FCH(k), which would establish a
surprising connection between the extremal combinatorics of (un)satisfiability
and elementary number theory.
  We apply the lower bound to analyse the structure of MUs and UHITs.

In 2012, Hubble Space Telescope returned to EK Dra to follow up a
far-ultraviolet (FUV) SNAPshot visit by Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) two
years earlier. The brief SNAP pointing had found surprisingly redshifted,
impulsively variable subcoronal ""hot-line"" emission of Si IV 140 nm (T~ 80,000
K). Serendipitously, the 2012 follow-on program witnessed one of the largest
FUV flares ever recorded on a sunlike star, which again displayed strong
redshifts (downflows) of 30-40 km/s, even after compensating for small
systematics in the COS velocity scales, uncovered through a cross-calibration
by Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The (now reduced, but still
substantial) ~10 km/s hot-line redshifts outside the flaring interval did not
vary with rotational phase, so cannot be caused by ""Doppler Imaging"" (bright
surface patches near a receding limb). Density diagnostic O IV] 140 nm
multiplet line ratios of EK Dra suggest log(Ne)~ 11, an order of magnitude
larger than in low-activity solar twin Alpha Centauri A, but typical of
densities inferred in large stellar soft X-ray events. The self-similar FUV
hot-line profiles between the flare decay and the subsequent more quiet
periods, and the unchanging but high densities, reinforce a long-standing idea
that the coronae of hyperactive dwarfs are flaring all the time, in a
scale-free way; a ""flare-ona"" if you will. In this picture, the subsonic
hot-line downflows probably are a byproduct of the post-flare cooling process,
something like ""coronal rain"" on the Sun. All in all, the new STIS/COS program

  Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF 2015), Verona, Italy, July 2015",,,,"cs.GT cs.CR math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Choosing a hard-to-guess secret is a prerequisite in many security
applications. Whether it is a password for user authentication or a secret key
for a cryptographic primitive, picking it requires the user to trade-off
usability costs with resistance against an adversary: a simple password is
easier to remember but is also easier to guess; likewise, a shorter
cryptographic key may require fewer computational and storage resources but it
is also easier to attack. A fundamental question is how one can optimally
resolve this trade-off. A big challenge is the fact that an adversary can also
utilize the knowledge of such usability vs. security trade-offs to strengthen
its attack. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for analyzing
the optimal trade-offs in the face of strategic adversaries. We consider two
types of adversaries: those limited in their number of tries, and those that
are ruled by the cost of making individual guesses. For each type, we derive
the mutually-optimal decisions as Nash Equilibria, the strategically
pessimistic decisions as maximin, and optimal commitments as Strong Stackelberg
Equilibria of the game. We establish that when the adversaries are faced with a
capped number of guesses, the user's optimal trade-off is a uniform
randomization over a subset of the secret domain. On the other hand, when the
attacker strategy is ruled by the cost of making individual guesses, Nash
Equilibria may completely fail to provide the user with any level of security,
signifying the crucial role of credible commitment for such cases. We
illustrate our results using numerical examples based on real-world samples and
discuss some policy implications of our work.

examined the kinetic properties of Alfv\'en waves in simple Maxwellian or
bi-Maxwellian plasmas. However, the observed electron velocity distribution
functions in the solar wind are more complex. In this study, we analyze the
properties of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with two drifting electron
populations. We numerically solve the linearized Maxwell-Vlasov equations and
find that the damping rate and the proton-electron energy partition for kinetic
Alfv\'en waves are significantly modified in such plasmas, compared to plasmas
without electron drifts. We suggest that electron drift is an important factor
to take into account when considering the dissipation of Alfv\'enic turbulence
in the solar wind or other $\beta \sim 1$ astrophysical plasmas.

  In the first part of the thesis, we envisage a new class of plasmonic cloaks
made of magneto-optical (MO) materials. We demonstrate that the application of
a uniform magnetic field B in these cloaks may not only switch on and off the
cloaking mechanism, but also mitigate the electromagnetic (EM) absorption. We
also prove that the scattered field profile can be effectively controlled by
changing B.
  The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of light-matter
interactions mediated by fluctuations of the vacuum EM field. Firstly, we
demonstrate that the Purcell effect can be effectively suppressed for an
excited atom near a cloaking device. Furthermore, the decay rate of a quantum
emitter near a graphene-coated wall under the influence of an external magnetic
field is studied. We show that the MO properties of graphene strongly affect
the atomic lifetime and that B allows for an unprecedented control of the decay
channels of the system. In addition, we discuss the dispersive interaction
between an atom and suspended graphene in a magnetic field. For large
atom-graphene separations and low temperatures we show that the interaction
energy is a quantized function of B. Besides, we show that at room temperature,
thermal effects must be taken into account even in the extreme near-field
regime.
  Finally, the third part of the thesis deals with the study of near-field heat
transfer. We analyze the energy transfered from a semi-infinite medium to a
composite sphere made of metallic inclusions embedded in a dielectric host
medium. We show that the heat transfer can be strongly enhanced at the
percolation phase transition. We show that our results apply for different
effective medium models and are robust against changes in the inclusions' shape

most challenging problem is related to determination of model complexity (i.e.,
multilinear rank), especially when noise and missing data are present. In
addition, existing methods cannot take into account uncertainty information of
latent factors, resulting in low generalization performance. To address these
issues, we present a class of probabilistic generative Tucker models for tensor
decomposition and completion with structural sparsity over multilinear latent
space. To exploit structural sparse modeling, we introduce two group sparsity
inducing priors by hierarchial representation of Laplace and Student-t
distributions, which facilitates fully posterior inference. For model learning,
we derived variational Bayesian inferences over all model (hyper)parameters,
and developed efficient and scalable algorithms based on multilinear
operations. Our methods can automatically adapt model complexity and infer an
optimal multilinear rank by the principle of maximum lower bound of model
evidence. Experimental results and comparisons on synthetic, chemometrics and

network evolution (NE) is defined formally as an optimization problem and

instance is created using a given real or synthetic (random) network. After
being reverse-reduced to a KP instance, each NE instance is fed to a KP solver

multiple rounds of simulated evolutionary pressure. The results show that
biological networks (and synthetic networks of similar degree distribution)
achieve the highest ratios at maximal evolutionary pressure and minimal error
tolerance conditions. The more distant (in degree distribution) a synthetic

visual search elicit similar patterns of firing across a population of recorded

images was strongly correlated with the inverse of decision time in behaviour.
But why should decision times be correlated with $L^{1}$ distance? What is the
decision-theoretic basis? In our decision theoretic formulation, we modeled
visual search as an active sequential hypothesis testing problem with switching
costs. Our analysis suggests an appropriate neuronal dissimilarity index which
correlates equally strongly with the inverse of decision time as the $L^{1}$
distance. We also consider a number of other possibilities such as the relative
entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) and the Chernoff entropy of the firing
rate distributions. A more stringent test of equality of means, which would
have provided a strong backing for our modeling fails for our proposed as well
as the other already discussed dissimilarity indices. However, test statistics
from the equality of means test, when used to rank the indices in terms of
their ability to explain the observed results, places our proposed
dissimilarity index at the top followed by relative entropy, Chernoff entropy
and the $L^{1}$ indices. Computations of the different indices requires an
estimate of the relative entropy between two Poisson point processes. An
estimator is developed and is shown to have near unbiased performance for
almost all operating regions.

no-hair theorem are presented. It is also shown that in the absence of a
stationary cosmological event horizon in the asymptotic region, a stationary
black hole horizon can support a non-trivial Brans-Dicke hair. Even more
importantly, it is shown next, that the presence of a stationary cosmological
event horizon rules out any regular stationary solution, appropriate for the
description of a star. Thus, to describe a star one has to assume that there is
no such stationary horizon in the faraway asymptotic region. Under this
implicit assumption generic spherical cosmic structures are studied
perturbatively and is shown that only for $\omega>0$ or $\omega\lesssim -5$
their predicted maximum sizes are consistent with observations. We also point
out how, many of the conclusions of this work differ qualitatively from the
$\Lambda=0$ spacetimes.

particular, the extortionate strategies can subdue the opponent and obtain
higher scores. However, no empirical evidence has yet been found to support
this theoretical finding. In a long-run laboratory experiment of the iterated
Prisoners' Dilemma pairing each human subject with a computer co-player, we
demonstrate that the extortionate strategy indeed outperforms the generous

strategy achieves higher scores than the generous strategy, the extortionate
strategy promotes the cooperation rate to a similar level as the generous
strategy does, and the human subjects' cooperation rates in both the
extortionate and generous treatments are increasing over time. While our
results imply that the human subjects cared about their earnings as well as
fairness or reciprocity, we do observe that subjects learned to become
increasingly cooperative over time to increase their own monetary payoffs. Our

demonstrate that the traffic states span a 2D region in the speed-spacing (or

In this paper, we propose a novel respiratory monitoring system, UbiBreathe,

that the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a
person's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to
scenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the
access point and the device, even without holding it. UbiBreathe leverages
these changes in the WiFi RSS patterns to enable ubiquitous non-invasive
respiratory rate estimation, as well as apnea detection.
  We propose the full architecture and design for UbiBreathe, incorporating
various modules that help reliably extract the hidden breathing signal from a
noisy WiFi RSS. The system handles various challenges such as noise
elimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting
abnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using
off-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it
can estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute
(bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96%
accuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios. This highlights
its suitability for a new class of anywhere respiratory monitoring.

  Painlev\'e equations","26 pages",,"10.1063/1.4937760",,"math-ph hep-th math.CA math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop the theory of irregular conformal blocks of the Virasoro algebra.
In previous studies, expansions of irregular conformal blocks at regular
singular points were obtained as degeneration limits of regular conformal
blocks; however, such expansions at irregular singular points were not clearly
understood. This is because precise definitions of irregular vertex operators
had not been provided previously. In this paper, we present precise definitions
of irregular vertex operators of two types and we prove that one of our vertex
operators exists uniquely. Then, we define irregular conformal blocks with at
most two irregular singular points as expectation values of given irregular
vertex operators. Our definitions provide an understanding of expansions of
irregular conformal blocks and enable us to obtain expansions at irregular
singular points.
  As an application, we propose conjectural formulas of series expansions of
the tau functions of the fifth and fourth Painlev\'e equations, using
expansions of irregular conformal blocks at an irregular singular point.

hypotheses. The first states that strong social ties carry the large majority
of interaction events; the second maintains that weak social ties, although
less active, are often relevant for the exchange of especially important
information (e.g., about potential new jobs in Granovetter's work). While
several empirical studies have provided support for the first hypothesis, the
second has been the object of far less scrutiny. A possible reason is that it
involves notions relative to the nature and importance of the information that
are hard to quantify and measure, especially in large scale studies. Here, we
search for empirical validation of both Granovetter's hypotheses. We find clear
empirical support for the first. We also provide empirical evidence and a
quantitative interpretation for the second. We show that attention, measured as
the fraction of interactions devoted to a particular social connection, is high
on weak ties --- possibly reflecting the postulated informational purposes of
such ties --- but also on very strong ties. Data from online social media and
mobile communication reveal network-dependent mixtures of these two effects on
the basis of a platform's typical usage. Our results establish a clear
relationships between attention, importance, and strength of social links, and
could lead to improved algorithms to prioritize social media content.

Employing all-spin logic (ASL) devices, we design logic comparators and
non-Boolean decision blocks for compact and efficient computation. By
manipulation of fan-in number in different stages of the circuit, the structure
can be extended for larger training sets or larger images. Operating based on
the mainly similarity idea, the system is capable of constructing a mean image
and compare it with a separate input image within a short decision time. Taking
advantage of the non-volatility of ASL devices, the proposed circuit is capable
of hybrid memory/logic operation. Compared with existing CMOS pattern
recognition circuits, this work achieves a smaller footprint, lower power
consumption, faster decision time and a lower operational voltage. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first fully spin-based complete pattern
recognition circuit demonstrated using spintronic devices.

paper of Johnson, Aragon, McGeoch, and Schevon. This implementation uses no
structure peculiar to the maximum cut problem, but its low per-iteration cost
allows it to find better solutions than were previously known for 40 of the 89
standard maximum cut instances tested within a few minutes of computation.

  Transport Nodes","8 pages, 1 figure","Transport Problems, 2014, Volume 9, Issue 3, pp.125-132",,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At present there are two trends in the market of rail freight transportation
in Russia: freight owners put forward higher demands to the transportation
quality (promptness of delivery) in an effort to reduce storage costs by means
of reducing the size of freight shipment; the structure of railcar traffic
volume of the railways of Russia is getting more complex due to the reduction
of the average shipment size and due to the transfer of railcar fleet ownership
to a large number of operating companies. These trends significantly complicate
operational management supervision of railway stations and transport nodes.
Application of typical data from the information system about the railcar
location at the transportation node is not enough for the dispatchers to make
the best decision concerning the car traffic management. The article is
concerned with the description and development of the mathematical model of
empty railcar distribution for loading at the railway transport node; this
model will take into account the requirements of railcar owners in terms of
their cars application, the operating work level of railroad stations of the
transportation node and the possibility of adding the groups of empty railcars
to the transfer trains, clean-up trains and industrial railway trains operating
on a tight schedule. The developed model and the software package were
implemented in the information system of the industrial railway of the major
metallurgical enterprise - OJSC ""Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Works"", which
processes up to two thousand of railcars belonging to different owners. This
model made it possible to reduce the labour intensity of dispatcher operation
planning the empty railcar distribution for loading and reduce the total time
the railcars spend in the enterprise railway system.
