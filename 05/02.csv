phosphenes, we analyze traveling wave solutions in a chain of periodically
forced coupled nonlinear oscillators modeling this phenomenon. We examine the
discrete model problem in its co-traveling frame and systematically obtain the
corresponding traveling waves in one spatial dimension. Direct numerical
simulations as well as linear stability analysis are employed to reveal the
parameter regions where the traveling waves are stable, and these waves are, in
turn, connected to the standing waves analyzed in earlier work. We also
consider a two-dimensional extension of the model and demonstrate the robust
evolution and stability of planar fronts and annihilation of radial ones.
Finally, we show that solutions that initially feature two symmetric fronts
with bulged centers evolve in qualitative agreement with experimental
observations of phosphenes.

intermediate Hamiltonians that modify the evolution path between initial and

hardware implementations and present numerical evidence for the existence of a
purely local intermediate Hamiltonian that achieve the optimum performance in
terms of pushing the minimum gap to one of the end points of the evolution. As
a part of this study we develop a convex optimization formulation of the search
for optimal adiabatic schedules that makes this computation more tractable, and

random intermediate Hamiltonians on the minimum gap and success probability,

instanton liquid background, the contribution arising from the the interference
between instantons and the quantum gluon fields is calculated, and included in
the correlation function together with pure-classical contribution from
instantons and the perturbative one. The interference contribution is turned to
be gauge-invariant, free of infrared divergence, and has a great role to
restore the positivity of the spectra of the full correlation function. The
negligible contribution from vacuum condensates is excluded in our correlation
function to avoid the double counting. Instead of the usual zero-width
approximation for the resonances, the usual Breit-Wigner form with a suitable
threshold behavior for the spectral function of the finite-width resonances is
adopted. A consistency between the subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules is
very well justified. The values of the mass, decay width and coupling constants

this volatility relates to long-standing and deeply rooted cultural and

present for 500 years or more but occasionally reveal themselves, at times like
this. In this paper our purpose is to raise the notion that these fault lines
are critical to thinking about regionalism, nationalism and the hierarchy of
cities in Great Britain (excluding Northern Ireland). We use a percolation
method (Arcaute et al. 2015) to reveal them that treats Britain as a giant
cluster of related places each defined from the intersections of the road
network at a very fine spatial scale. We break this giant cluster into a
detailed hierarchy of sub-clusters by successively reducing a distance
threshold which first breaks off some of the Scottish Islands and then reveals
the very distinct nations and regions that make up Britain, all the way down to
the definition of the largest cities that appear when the threshold reaches
300m. We use these percolation clusters to apportion the 2010 voting pattern to
a new hierarchy of constituencies based on these clusters, and this gives us a
picture of how Britain might vote on purely geographical lines. We then examine
this voting pattern which provides us with some sense of how important the new

dynamo model to shallow non-axisymmetric perturbations. After a relaxation
period the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric field depends on the initial
condition, helicity conservation, and the depth of perturbation. It is found
that a perturbation which is anchored at r=0.9R has a profound effect on the
dynamo process, producing a transient magnetic cycle of the axisymmetric
magnetic field, if it is initiated at the growing phase of the cycle. The
non-symmetric with respect to the equator perturbation results in a hemispheric
asymmetry of the magnetic activity. The evolution of the axisymmetric and
non-axisymmetric field depends on the turbulent magnetic Reynolds number R_m.
In the range of R_m=10^{4-6} the evolution returns to the normal course in the
next cycle, in which the non-axisymmetric field is generated due to a
non-linear alpha-effect and magnetic buoyancy. In the stationary state the
large-scale magnetic field demonstrates a phenomenon of ""active longitudes""
with cyclic 180 degree ""flip-flop"" changes of the large-scale magnetic field
orientation. The flip-flop effect is known from observations of solar and
stellar magnetic cycles. However this effect disappears in the model which
includes the meridional circulation pattern determined by helioseismology. The
rotation rate of the non-axisymmetric field components varies during the
relaxation period, and carries important information about the dynamo process.

manifolds to algebraic settings where there is no sensible notion of limit. In
this paper, we consider derivations in certain monoidal categories, called
codifferential categories. Differential categories were introduced as the
categorical framework for modelling differential linear logic. The deriving
transform of a differential category, which models the differentiation
inference rule, is a derivation in the dual category. We here explore that
derivation's universality.
  One of the key structures associated to a codifferential category is an
algebra modality. This is a monad $T$ such that each object of the form $TC$ is
canonically an associative, commutative algebra. Consequently, every
$T$-algebra has a canonical commutative algebra structure, and we show that
universal derivations for these algebras can be constructed quite generally.
  It is a standard result that there is a bijection between derivations from an
associative algebra $A$ to an $A$-module $M$ and algebra homomorphisms over $A$
from $A$ to $A\oplus M$, with $A\oplus M$ being considered as an infinitesimal
extension of $A$. We lift this correspondence to our setting by showing that in
a codifferential category there is a canonical $T$-algebra structure on
$A\oplus M$. We call $T$-algebra morphisms from $TA$ to this $T$-algebra
structure Beck $T$-derivations. This yields a novel, generalized notion of
derivation.
  The remainder of the paper is devoted to exploring consequences of that
definition. Along the way, we prove that the symmetric algebra construction in
any suitable symmetric monoidal category provides an example of codifferential
structure, and using this, we give an alternative definition for differential

if the system is embedded in string theory so that the Higgs fields parametrize
a D-brane position. The inflaton potential is then given by a DBI+CS D-brane
action yielding an approximate linear behaviour at large field. The inflaton
scalar potential is a 2-field model with specific non-canonical kinetic terms.
Previous computations of the cosmological parameters (i.e. scalar and tensor
perturbations) did not take into account the full 2-field character of the
model, ignoring in particular the presence of isocurvature perturbations and
their coupling to the adiabatic modes. It is well known that for generic
2-field potentials such effects may significantly alter the observational
signatures of a given model. We perform a full analysis of adiabatic and
isocurvature perturbations in the Higgs-otic 2-field model. We show that the
predictivity of the model is increased compared to the adiabatic approximation.
Isocurvature perturbations moderately feed back into adiabatic fluctuations.
However, the isocurvature component is exponentially damped by the end of
inflation. The tensor to scalar ratio varies in a region $r=0.08-0.12$,
consistent with combined Planck/BICEP results.

complex. It is immediate that the construction of the spectral sequence of
Chapter 3 can be applied to any reductive subalgebra $\mathfrak{g} \subset

  In case the symplectic group is large relative to the orthogonal group ($k
\geq pq$), the $E_0$ term is isomorphic to a Koszul complex defined by a
regular sequence, see 3.4. Thus, the cohomology vanishes except in top degree.
This result is obtained without calculating the space of cochains and hence
without using any representation theory. On the other hand, in case $k < p$, we
know the Koszul complex is not that of a regular sequence from the existence of
the class $\varphi_{kq}$ of Kudla and Millson, see [KM2], a nonzero element of
the relative Lie algebra cohomology of degree $kq$.
  For the case of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,1)$ we compute the cohomology groups in
these remaining cases, namely $k < p$. We do this by first computing a basis
for the relative Lie algebra cochains and then splitting the complex into a sum
of two complexes, each of whose $E_0$ term is then isomorphic to a Koszul
complex defined by a regular sequence.

and (b) the same final state from two different production modes. While most
theoretical uncertainties cancel in the former, the latter helps in the case of
those operators which shift the numerator and denominator in opposite
directions. Our analysis, incorporating theoretical, systematic and statistical
uncertain, leads to projected limits that are better than the strongest ones
obtained so far from precision electroweak as well as LHC Higgs data. Moreover,
values of the coefficients of the dimension-6 operators, which are allowed in
disjoint intervals, can have their ranges narrowed down substantially in our
approach.

extensions of density functional theory, in which additional correlations on
specified correlated orbitals are treated using a Hartree-Fock approximation.
Differences between using charge-only or spin-density-dependent
exchange-correlation functionals and between Wannier and projector-based
definitions of the correlated orbitals are considered on the formal level and
in the context of the structural energetics of the rare earth nickelates. It is
demonstrated that theories based on spin-dependent exchange-correlation
functionals can lead to large and in some cases unphysical effective on-site
exchange couplings. Wannier and projector-based definitions of the correlated
orbitals lead to similar behavior near ambient pressure, but substantial
differences are observed at large pressures. Implications for other beyond
density functional methods such as the combination of density functional and
dynamical mean field theory are discussed.

Through visual inspection of the images, we find that 17 of 39 AGN host

abnormally high, we also examined the merging fraction of normal early-type

redshift of 0.04), of which the surface-brightness limit is comparable to our

the two samples, we performed an image simulation by putting a bright point
source as an artificial AGN in the images of SDSS early-type galaxies and
placing them onto the redshifts of AGNs. The merging fraction in this realistic
sample of simulated AGNs is only $\sim 5 - 15\%$ ($1/4$ to $1/8$ of that of

2~M_\odot$ has placed a strong lower limit on the maximum mass of nonrotating
neutron stars, and with it a strong constraint on the properties of cold matter
beyond nuclear density. Current upper mass limits are much looser. Here we note
that, if most short gamma-ray bursts are produced by the coalescence of two
neutron stars, and if the merger remnant collapses quickly, then the upper mass
limit is constrained tightly. If the rotation of the merger remnant is limited
only by mass-shedding (which seems probable based on numerical studies), then
the maximum gravitational mass of a nonrotating neutron star is $\approx
2-2.2~M_\odot$ if the masses of neutron stars that coalesce to produce
gamma-ray bursts are in the range seen in Galactic double neutron star systems.
These limits would be increased by $\sim 4$% in the probably unrealistic case
that the remnants rotate at $\sim 30$% below mass-shedding, and by $\sim 15$%

detection of short gamma-ray bursts with gravitational waves will strengthen
these arguments because they will produce tight bounds on the masses of the
components for individual events. If these limits are accurate then a
reasonable fraction of double neutron star mergers might not produce gamma-ray
bursts. In that case, or in the case that many short bursts are produced
instead by the mergers of neutron stars with black holes, the implied rate of
gravitational wave detections will be increased.

they are known to fail if the posterior state distribution cannot be closely
approximated by a density of the assumed parametric form. For nonparametric
filters, such as the Particle Filter, the converse holds. Such methods are able
to approximate any posterior, but the computational requirements scale
exponentially with the number of dimensions of the state space. In this paper,
we present the Coordinate Particle Filter which alleviates this problem. We
propose to compute the particle weights recursively, dimension by dimension.
This allows us to explore one dimension at a time, and resample after each
dimension if necessary. Experimental results on simulated as well as real data
confirm that the proposed method has a substantial performance advantage over
the Particle Filter in high-dimensional systems where not all dimensions are
highly correlated. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method for the
problem of multi-object and robotic manipulator tracking.

we show that the proposed methods applied for some well-known U-statistics have
robust Type I error control under various underlying distributions including

systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a

We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators
that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our
representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene
to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two
extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct
perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. To
demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording
from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work
well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments. We also
train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset. Results show
that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.

the Herbig Ae star HD 245185, with a flux density of $\sim74$ mJy beam$^{-1}$
corresponding to a dust mass of $\sim150$ M$_{\oplus}$. Stacking the
individually undetected sources did not produce a significant mean signal but
gives an upper limit on the average dust mass for $\lambda$ Orionis disks of
$\sim3$ M$_{\oplus}$. Our follow-up observations of HD 245185 with the
Submillimeter Array found weak CO 2--1 line emission with an integrated flux of
$\sim170$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ but no $^{13}$CO or C$^{18}$O isotopologue emission

Ae disks of similar age, which have been found to be gas rich; as HD 245185

pathways to their formation includes direct collapse of gas, forming a
supermassive star, precursor of the black hole seed. The conditions for direct
collapse are more easily achievable in metal-free haloes, where atomic hydrogen
cooling operates and molecular hydrogen (H2) formation is inhibited by a strong
external UV flux. Above a certain value of UV flux (J_crit), the gas in a halo
collapses isothermally at ~$10^4$ K and provides the conditions for
supermassive star formation. However, H2 can self-shield, reducing the effect
of photodissociation. So far, most numerical studies used the local Jeans
length to calculate the column densities for self-shielding. We implement an
improved method for the determination of column densities in 3D simulations and
analyse its effect on the value of J_crit. This new method captures the gas
geometry and velocity field and enables us to properly determine the
direction-dependent self-shielding factor of H2 against photodissociating
radiation. We find a value of J_crit that is a factor of two smaller than with
the Jeans approach (~2000 J_21 vs. ~4000 J_21). The main reason for this
difference is the strong directional dependence of the H2 column density. With
this lower value of J_crit, the number of haloes exposed to a flux >J_crit is
larger by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous studies. This
may translate into a similar enhancement in the predicted number density of
black hole seeds.

formation. Unlike neutral hydrogen surveys, where the 21 cm line is the only
bright line, surveys of red-shifted fine-structure lines suffer from confusion
generated by line broadening, spectral overlap of different lines, and the
crowding of sources with redshift. We use simulations to investigate the
resulting spectral confusion and derive observing parameters to minimize these
effects in pencil-beam surveys of red-shifted far-IR line emission. We generate
simulated spectra of the 17 brightest far-IR lines in galaxies, covering the
150 to 1300 micron wavelength region corresponding to redshifts 0 < z < 7, and
develop a simple iterative algorithm that successfully identifies the 158

coolant for the interstellar medium, the assumption that the brightest observed
lines in a given line of sight are always [CII] lines is a poor approximation
to the simulated spectra once other lines are included. Blind line

galaxies, driving survey sensitivity requirements. The observations require
moderate spectral resolution 700 < R < 4000 with angular resolution between 20
arcsec and 10 armin, sufficiently narrow to minimize confusion yet sufficiently

growth times of low mass black holes in the local Universe, which must instead
result from gas being fed in from large radii, due either to gas inflows or

plausible and motivate future long-term monitoring of the planet.

masses < 0.1 M_sun and may explain some of the recent discoveries of weak and
fast optical transients. In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that
helium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and
evolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass
limit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution
leading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the
binary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron
core-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium
ejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or
Type Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star
donors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital
periods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also
discuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -
as well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the
evolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN
explosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe
CCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the
tightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less
than 0.01 M_sun. We estimate the rise time of ultra-stripped SNe to be in the
range 12 hr - 8 days, and light curve decay times between 1 and 50 days.
Ultra-stripped SNe may produce NSs in the mass range 1.10 - 1.80 M_sun and are
highly relevant for LIGO/VIRGO since most (possibly all) merging double NS
systems have evolved through this phase. Finally, we discuss the low-velocity
kicks which might be imparted on these resulting NSs at birth. [Abridged]

algorithm for learning finite-state controllers (FSCs) in large decentralized

converge to maxima that are far from optimal. This paper considers a
variable-size FSC to represent the local policy of each agent. These

new framework called \emph{decentralized stick-breaking policy representation}
(Dec-SBPR). This approach learns the controller parameters with a variational
Bayesian algorithm without having to assume that the Dec-POMDP model is
available. The performance of Dec-SBPR is demonstrated on several benchmark
problems, showing that the algorithm scales to large problems while
outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

estimate is constructed by matching localized expectation values of orthogonal

existing methods, and generalizes straightforwardly to multivariate settings.
By manner of construction, it is similar to Local Likelihood Density Estimation
(LLDE). In the limit of small bandwidths, LOrPE functions as Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) with high-order (effective) kernels inherently free of
boundary bias, a natural consequence of kernel reshaping to accommodate
endpoints. Faster asymptotic convergence rates follow. In the limit of large
bandwidths, LOrPE is equivalent to Orthogonal Series Density Estimation (OSDE)
with Legendre polynomials. We compare the performance of LOrPE to KDE, LLDE,
and OSDE, in a number of simulation studies. In terms of mean integrated

higher object-level context is provided to guide part segmentation, and more
detailed part-level localization is utilized to refine object segmentation.
Specifically, we first introduce the concept of semantic compositional parts
(SCP) in which similar semantic parts are grouped and shared among different
objects. A two-channel fully convolutional network (FCN) is then trained to
provide the SCP and object potentials at each pixel. At the same time, a
compact set of segments can also be obtained from the SCP predictions of the
network. Given the potentials and the generated segments, in order to explore
long-range context, we finally construct an efficient fully connected
conditional random field (FCRF) to jointly predict the final object and part
labels. Extensive evaluation on three different datasets shows that our
approach can mutually enhance the performance of object and part segmentation,
and outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both tasks.

mantle convection and surface plate tectonics, which sustains a deep carbon and
water cycle and thereby aides in creating Earth's habitable surface. Unlike
other heat sources that are dependent on the planet's specific formation
history, the radiogenic heat budget is directly related to the mantle
concentration of these nuclides. As a refractory element, the stellar abundance
of Th is faithfully reflected in the terrestrial planet's concentration. We
find that log eps Th varies from 59% to 251% that of Solar, suggesting
extrasolar planetary systems may possess a greater energy budget with which to

instances of tasks from a familiar domain. Acting online requires 'fast'
responses, in terms of rapid convergence, especially when the task instance has
a short duration, such as in applications involving interactions with humans.
These requirements can be problematic for many established methods for learning
to act. In domains where the agent knows that the task instance is drawn from a
family of related tasks, albeit without access to the label of any given
instance, it can choose to act through a process of policy reuse from a
library, rather than policy learning from scratch. In policy reuse, the agent
has prior knowledge of the class of tasks in the form of a library of policies
that were learnt from sample task instances during an offline training phase.
We formalise the problem of policy reuse, and present an algorithm for
efficiently responding to a novel task instance by reusing a policy from the
library of existing policies, where the choice is based on observed 'signals'
which correlate to policy performance. We achieve this by posing the problem as
a Bayesian choice problem with a corresponding notion of an optimal response,
but the computation of that response is in many cases intractable. Therefore,
to reduce the computation cost of the posterior, we follow a Bayesian
optimisation approach and define a set of policy selection functions, which
balance exploration in the policy library against exploitation of previously
tried policies, together with a model of expected performance of the policy
library on their corresponding task instances. We validate our method in
several simulated domains of interactive, short-duration episodic tasks,

frequency proportional to the vortex line tension parameter to the quarter

classical Ekman pumping that is periodically reversed by the vortex tension in

Tkachenko modes provide a natural explanation for the observed oscillation. In
neutron stars, the oscillation period depends on the pinning interaction
between neutron vortices and flux tubes in the outer core. Using a simplified
pinning model, we demonstrate that strong pinning can accommodate modes with
periods of days to years, which are only weakly damped by mutual friction over

an approach to incorporate notion of monotonicity in NMF, labeled as monotonous

is relaxed to extend monotonous NMF for data matrix with real numbers as

material of a fixed packing fraction below $\phi_J$, i.e. the isotropic jamming
density of frictionless spheres can produce shear jamming states, as have been
discovered recently. In addition, it has also been discovered that the system
will first experience a bulk fragile state before evolving into a shear jammed
state. Due to the existence of friction between the system and the third
dimension in the previous studies, it is unclear whether such fragile state
would still exist on the route to shear jamming if the friction with the third
dimension were completely eliminated and the background noise level were
greatly reduced. Using a novel apparatus, we have completely eliminated the
friction between particles and the third dimension by floating the particles on
the surface of a shallow water layer thus revealing more details of the route
of shear-jamming. We are able to measure weak boundary pressure of three orders
of magnitude below the resolution of the photo-elastic method through the
combination force-gauges of high sensitivity and a cantilever-like simple-beam
apparatus. In a system with weak cohesion, we have indeed observed the bulk
fragile states before the shear jamming; in addition, we have also discovered
the boundary fragile states and regimes of negligible shear modus compared to
bulk modulus. Most importantly, we now have a much better understanding of the
bulk fragile state: its existence requires an auxiliary in some form, e.g. the
weak cohesion in this experiment. By constructing a way to freely tune down the
cohesion to more than six orders of magnitude smaller, to our surprise, we have
discovered the complete vanishing of the bulk fragile states, which thus allows
us to determine the plausible origin of the bulk fragile state.

simultaneous transmission to multiple users, which requires multi-user

higher sum rates compared with analog-only beamforming, and approaches the

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to the radio afterglows, we investigate the effect of
host galaxies on observations statistically. For the three types of events,
e.g. low-luminosity, standard and high-luminosity GRBs, it is found that a
tight correlation exists between the ratio of the radio flux (RRF) of host
galaxy to the total radio peak emission and the observational frequency.
Especially, toward lower frequencies, the contribution from the host increases
significantly. The correlation can be used to get a useful estimate for the
radio brightness of those host galaxies which only have very limited radio
afterglow data. Using this prediction, we re-considered the theoretical radio
afterglow light curves for four kinds of events, i.e. high-luminosity,
low-luminosity, standard and failed GRBs, taking into account the contribution
from the host galaxies and aiming at exploring the detectability of these
events by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).
Lying at a typical redshift of $z=1$, most of the events can be detected by
FAST easily. For the less fierce low-luminosity GRBs, their radio afterglows
are not strong enough to exceed the sensitivity limit of FAST at such
distances. However, since a large number of low luminosity bursts actually
happen very near to us, it is expected that FAST will still be able to detect
many of them.

seems comprehensible, and correspondingly why there should exist physical

two problems might be related and could be explainable in terms of fundamental
physics. The perspective presented suggests a potential unified framework
where, when taken together, comprehenders and comprehensibility are part of
causal structure of physical reality, which is considered as a causal graph
(network) connecting states that are physically possible. I argue that in some
local regions, the most probable states are those that include physical systems
which contain information encodings - such as mathematics, language and art -
because these are the most highly connected to other possible states in this
causal graph. Such physical systems include life and - of particular interest
for the discussion of the place of math in physical reality - comprehenders
capable of making mathematical sense of the world. Within this framework, the
descent of math is an undirected outcome of the evolution of the universe,
which will tend toward states that are increasingly connected to other possible
states of the universe, a process greatly facilitated if some physical systems
know the rules of the game. I therefore conclude that our ability to use
mathematics to describe, and more importantly manipulate, the natural world may
not be an anomaly or trick, but instead could provide clues to the underlying
causal structure of physical reality.

micromechanical experiments on oxyhemoglobin crystals to determine the behavior
of the Young's modulus and the internal friction for temperatures between 20 C

a sudden and strong increase of their Young's modulus, accompanied by a sudden
decrease of the internal friction. This sudden mechanical change (proteinquake)
takes place in a partially unfolded state and precedes the full denaturation
transition at higher temperatures. The hemoglobin crystals after the
proteinquake has the same mechanical properies as the initial state at room
temperatures. We conjecture that it can be relevant for explaining the
oxygen-releasing function of native oxyhemoglobin when the temperature is
increased, e.g. due to active sport. The effect is specific for the quaternary

demonstrate a different nature for small granular cells because they exhibit on

position permutation on two levels: intra-block and inter-block. As a typical

that only $O(\lceil\log_T(M\cdot N/K) \rceil)$ known/chosen plain-images are
sufficient to achieve a good performance, and the computational complexity is
$O(M\cdot N\cdot \lceil\log_T(M\cdot N/K) \rceil)$, which effectively
demonstrates that hierarchical permutation-only image encryption algorithms are
less secure than normal (i.e., non-hierarchical) ones. Detailed experiment

independent of a particular rainbow function, the positive energy condition
dictates a positive spatial curvature for the Universe. In fact, without
raising a nonphysical energy condition in the quantum gravity regimes, we can
address an agreement between gravity's rainbow scenario and basic assumption of

position of trajectories (projected onto 2D or 3D space) as single points of

nature of GPU hardware, Fireflies is able to simulate millions of trajectories
in parallel (even on standard desktop computer hardware), producing ""swarms"" of
particles that move around the screen in real-time according to the equations
of the system. Particles that move forwards in time reveal stable attractors
(e.g. fixed points and limit cycles), while the option of integrating another
group of trajectories backwards in time can reveal unstable objects
(repellers). Fireflies allows the user to change the parameters of the system
as it is running, in order to see the effect that they have on the dynamics and
to observe bifurcations. We demonstrate the capabilities of the software with

around the study of human brain. Neurobiological studies that compare the
nervous system of different species have accorded highest place to the humans
on account of various factors that include a highly developed cortical area
comprising of approximately 100 billion neurons, that are intrinsically
connected to form a highly complex network. Quantum theories of consciousness
are based on mathematical abstraction and Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR Theory is
one of the most promising ones. Inspired by Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR Theory,
Behrman et. al. (Behrman, 2006) have simulated a quantum Hopfield neural
network with the structure of a microtubule. They have used an extremely
simplified model of the tubulin dimers with each dimer represented simply as a
qubit, a single quantum two-state system. The extension of this model to
n-dimensional quantum states, or n-qudits presented in this work holds
considerable promise for even higher mathematical abstraction in modelling
consciousness systems.

adaptive intelligent systems are organized. According to that theory biological
agents adapt at three levels of organization and this structure applies also to
our brains. This is referred to as tri-traversal theory of the organization of
mind or for short, a T3-structure. To implement a similar T3-organization in an
artificially intelligent agent, it is necessary to have multiple policies, as
usually used as a concept in the theory of reinforcement learning. These
policies have to form a hierarchy. We define adaptive practopoietic systems in
terms of hierarchy of policies and calculate whether the total variety of
behavior required by real-life conditions of an adult human can be
satisfactorily accounted for by a traditional approach to artificial
intelligence based on T2-agents, or whether a T3-agent is needed instead. We
conclude that the complexity of real life can be dealt with appropriately only
by a T3-agent.

to dilaton gravity. We introduce the $(n+1)$-dimensional action in which
gravity is coupled to a dilaton and power-law nonlinear Maxwell field, and
obtain the field equations by varying the action. We construct a new class of
higher dimensional topological black hole solutions of Einstein-dilaton theory
coupled to a power-law nonlinear Maxwell field and investigate the effects of
the nonlinearity of the Maxwell source as well as the dilaton field on the
properties of the spacetime. Interestingly enough, we find that the solutions
exist provided one assumes three Liouville-type potentials for the dilaton
field, and in case of the Maxwell field one of the Liouville potential
vanishes. After studying the physical properties of the solutions, we compute
the mass, charge, electric potential and temperature of the topological dilaton
black holes. We also study thermodynamics and thermal stability of the
solutions and disclose the effects of the dilaton field and the power-law
Maxwell field on the thermodynamics of these black holes. Finally, we comment
on the dynamical stability of the obtained solutions in four-dimensions.

design of mesoscale cuboid-chain waveguide. The chains are basically designed
with several dielectric cubes with dimensions {\lambda}0 along the x, y and z
axes placed periodically along the axial z-axis and separated by an air-gap.
Based on this, a systematic study of the focusing properties and wave guiding
of this chain is performed when the air-gap between the dielectric cubes is
changed from 0.25{\lambda}0 to 2.5{\lambda}0 with the best performance achieved
with the latter design. The numerical results of focusing and transport
properties are carried out using Finite Integration Technique. The results here
presented may be scaled to any frequency ranges such as millimeter,
sub-millimeter or optical frequencies.

derived from self-consistent theory of localization by Vollhardt and Woelfle. A
diagrammatic interpretation of results allows to obtain all scaling relations
used in numerical experiments. The arguments are given that the one-loop Wegner
result for a space dimension d=2+\epsilon may appear to be exact, so the
multifractal spectrum is strictly parabolical. The \sigma-models are shown to
be deficient at the four-loop level and the possible reasons of that are
discussed. The extremely slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit is
demonstrated. The open question on the relation between multifractality and a
spatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient D(\omega,q) is resolved in the
compromise manner due to ambiguity of the D(\omega,q) definition. Comparison is
made with the extensive numerical material.
