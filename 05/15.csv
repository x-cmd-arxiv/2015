find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the mean and
standard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define three
different word regimes of languages: ""heads"" consist of words which almost do
not change their rank in time, ""bodies"" are words of general use, while ""tails""
are comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in
time. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by
linguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model
which reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity.
Rank diversity of words can be understood as the result of random variations in
rank, where the size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that

study a realistic model that includes the relevant physics of superconductivity
in the presence of strong Coulomb correlations. We consider a two-band model,
since most of these correlated systems have electrons from at least two
different atomic orbitals coexisting at their Fermi surface. The Coulomb
repulsion is taken into account through a local repulsive interaction. Pairing
is considered among quasi- particles in neighbouring sites and we allow for
different symmetries of the order parameter. In order to deal with the strong
local correlations, we use the well known slave boson approach that has proved
very successful for this problem. Here we are interested in obtaining the zero
temperature properties of the model, specifically its phase diagram and the
existence and nature of superconducting quantum critical points. We show that
these can arise by increasing the mixing between the two bands. Since this can
be controlled by external pressure or doping, our results have a direct
relation with experiments. We show that the superconductor-to-normal transition
can be either to a metal, a correlated metal or to an insulator. Also we
compare the relative stability of s and d-wave paired states for different

implementation of the ordinary (i.e. strong, pure, call-by-name)
$\lambda$-calculus into models like RAM machines which is polynomial in the

was the use of a calculus with useful sharing, a new notion whose complexity
was shown to be polynomial, but whose implementation was not explored. This
paper, meant to be complementary, studies useful sharing in a call-by-value
scenario and from a practical point of view. We introduce the Fireball
Calculus, a natural extension of call-by-value to open terms for which the
problem is as hard as for the ordinary lambda-calculus. We present three
results. First, we adapt the solution of Accattoli and Dal Lago, improving the
meta-theory of useful sharing. Then, we refine the picture by introducing the
GLAMoUr, a simple abstract machine implementing the Fireball Calculus extended
with useful sharing. Its key feature is that usefulness of a step is
tested---surprisingly---in constant time. Third, we provide a further
optimization that leads to an implementation having only a linear overhead with
respect to the number of $\beta$-steps.

trimaximal pattern and the Dirac CP phase remains trivial. The smallest groups

coincide with an entanglement entropy in the case of pure states, but can be
non-zero in separable mixed states, vanishing just for classically correlated
states. It is then shown that their behavior in the exact ground state of the

entanglement below the critical field. In contrast with entanglement, they
reach full range in this region, becoming independent of the pair separation

significant findings to unmeasured confounding. While sensitivity analyses in
matched observational studies have been well addressed when there is a single
outcome variable, accounting for multiple comparisons through the existing
methods yields overly conservative results when there are multiple outcome
variables of interest. This stems from the fact that unmeasured confounding
cannot affect the probability of assignment to treatment differently depending
on the outcome being analyzed. Existing methods allow this to occur by
combining the results of individual sensitivity analyses to assess whether at
least one hypothesis is significant, which in turn results in an overly
pessimistic assessment of a study's sensitivity to unobserved biases. By
solving a quadratically constrained linear program, we are able to perform a
sensitivity analysis while enforcing that unmeasured confounding must have the
same impact on the treatment assignment probabilities across outcomes for each
individual in the study. We show that this allows for uniform improvements in
the power of a sensitivity analysis not only for testing the overall null of no
effect, but also for null hypotheses on \textit{specific} outcome variables
while strongly controlling the familywise error rate. We illustrate our method

at the frequency at which the power density spectrum shows a break in the
neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, using a large data set obtained
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We found that: (i) For the break
frequency QPO: for low frequencies, in general the time lag is positive, but it
is decreasing with increasing frequency, reaching zero lag at 20 Hz. Between 20
and 35 Hz there is a small fluctuation around zero, from where the time lags
become positive again and increase slightly above zero up to 65 Hz. (ii) For
the hHz QPO: we see that when the frequency is 100 Hz the time lag is negative,
but it increases to zero already at 110 Hz, being consistent with this value up
to 130 Hz from where it increases to 0.5 msec at around 140 Hz. From 140 Hz the
time lag decreases sharply, being strongly negative for hHz greater than 220
Hz. We compare these lags with our previous results for the lags of the
kiloHertz QPOs in this same source and discuss possible scenarios for producing
the lags in this system in the context of reflection off the accretion disc or
(up-)down-scattering in a hot medium close to the neutron star.

calculate a new N budget for Earth. Using analyses of rocks and minerals in
conjunction with N-Ar geochemistry demonstrates that the Bulk Silicate Earth
(BSE) contains \sim7\pm4 times present atmospheric N (4\times10^18 kg N, PAN),
with 27\pm16\times10^18 kg N. Comparison to chondritic composition, after
subtracting N sequestered into the core, yields a consistent result, with BSE N
between 17\pm13\times10^18 kg to 31\pm24\times10^18 kg N. In the chondritic
comparison we calculate a N mass in Earth's core (180\pm110 to
300\pm180\times10^18 kg) and discuss the Moon as a proxy for the early mantle.
  Significantly, we find the majority of the planetary budget of N is in the
solid Earth. The N estimate herein precludes the need for a ""missing N""
reservoir. Nitrogen-Ar systematics in mantle rocks and basalts identify two
mantle reservoirs: MORB-source like (MSL) and high-N. High-N mantle is composed
of young, N-rich material subducted from the surface and is identified in OIB
and some xenoliths. In contrast, MSL appears to be made of old material, though
a component of subducted material is evident in this reservoir as well.
  Using our new budget, we calculate a {\delta}15N value for BSE plus
atmosphere of \sim2\permil. This value should be used when discussing bulk
Earth N isotope evolution. Additionally, our work indicates that all surface N
could pass through the mantle over Earth history, and the mantle may act as a
long-term sink for N. Since N acts as a tracer of exchange between the
atmosphere, oceans, and mantle over time, clarifying its distribution in the
Earth is critical for evolutionary models concerned with Earth system
evolution. We suggest that N be viewed in the same vein as carbon: it has a
fast, biologically mediated cycle which connects it to a slow,
tectonically-controlled geologic cycle.

acceleration. In this parametrization the initial, at $z \gg z_t$, value of the
q-parameter is $q_i$, its final, z=-1, value is $q_f$ and the duration of the
transition is parametrized by $\tau$. By assuming a flat space geometry we
obtain constraints on the free parameters of the model using recent data from
type Ia supernovae, BAO, CMB and the Hubble parameter H(z). The use of H(z)
data introduces an explicit dependence of the combined likelihood on the
present value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$, allowing us to explore the
influence of different priors when marginalizing over this parameter. We also
study the importance of the CMB information in the results by considering data
from WMAP7, WMAP9 and Planck. We show that the contours and best fit do not
depend much on the different CMB data used and that the considered new BAO data
is responsible for most of the improvement in the results. Assuming a flat
space geometry, $q_i=1/2$ and expressing the present value of the deceleration
parameter $q_0$ as a function of the other three free parameters, we obtain
$z_t=0.67^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$, $\tau=0.26^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ and
$q_0=-0.48^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$, at 68\% of confidence level, with an uniform prior
over $H_0$. If in addition we fix $q_f=-1$, as in flat $\Lambda$CDM, DGP and

of prey-predator interactions, which have been considered as mechanisms that
contribute to spatial self-organization of prey and predator. In nature, there
are many examples of prey-predator interactions where prey is immobile while
predator disperses between patches non-randomly through different factors such
as stimuli following the encounter of a prey. In this work, we formulate a
Rosenzweig-MacArthur prey-predator two patch model with mobility only in
predator and the assumption that predators move towards patches with more
concentrated prey-predator interactions. We provide completed local and global
analysis of our model. Our analytical results combined with bifurcation
diagrams suggest that: (1) dispersal may stabilize or destabilize the coupled
system; (2) dispersal may generate multiple interior equilibria that lead to
rich bistable dynamics or may destroy interior equilibria that lead to the
extinction of predator in one patch or both patches; (3) Under certain
conditions, the large dispersal can promote the permanence of the system. In
addition, we compare the dynamics of our model to the classic two patch model
to obtain a better understanding how different dispersal strategies may have
different impacts on the dynamics and spatial patterns.

analyze a mechanistic SEIR type outbreak model which considers the key features
of contact tracing, and we characterize the impact of contact tracing on the
effective reproduction number, $\mathcal R_e$, of Ebola. In particular, we
determine how relevant epidemiological properties such as incubation period,
infectious period and case reporting, along with varying monitoring protocols,
affect the efficacy of contact tracing. In the special cases of either perfect
monitoring of traced cases or perfect reporting of all cases, we derive simple
formulae for the critical proportion of contacts that need to be traced in
order to bring the effective reproduction number $\mathcal R_e$ below one.
Also, in either case, we show that $\mathcal R_e$ can be expressed completely
in terms of observable reported case/tracing quantities, namely $\mathcal
R_e=k\dfrac{(1-q)}{q}+k_m$ where $k$ is the number of secondary traced infected
contacts per primary untraced reported case, $k_m$ is the number of secondary
traced infected contacts per primary traced reported case and $(1-q)/q$ is the
odds that a reported case is not a traced contact. These formulae quantify
contact tracing as both an intervention strategy that impacts disease spread
and a probe into the current epidemic status at the population level. Data from
the West Africa Ebola outbreak is utilized to form real-time estimates of
$\mathcal R_e$, and inform our projections of the impact of contact tracing,
and other control measures, on the epidemic trajectory.

distinguishing between trapped (ordered and chaotic) and escaping orbits,
considering only unbounded motion for several energy levels. It is of
particular interest, to locate the basins of escape towards the different
escape channels and connect them with the corresponding escape periods of the
orbits. We split our examination into three different cases depending on the
function of the perturbation term which determines the number of escape
channels on the physical space. In every case, we computed extensive samples of
orbits in both the physical and the phase space by integrating numerically the
equations of motion as well as the variational equations. In an attempt to
determine the regular or chaotic nature of trapped motion, we applied the SALI
method as a chaos detector. It was found, that in all studied cases regions of
trapped orbits coexist with several basins of escape. It was also observed,
that for energy levels very close to the escape value the escape times of
orbits are large, while for values of energy much higher than the escape energy
the vast majority of orbits escape very quickly or even immediately to
infinity. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial
conditions in the boundaries of the escape basins and also in the vicinity of
the fractal structure. Most of the current outcomes have been compared with
previous related work. We hope that our results will be useful for a further
understanding of the escape mechanism of orbits in open Hamiltonian systems

that every aperiodic infinite word $x\in A^N,$ over a non empty finite alphabet
$A,$ contains at least $n+1$ distinct factors of each length $n.$ They further
showed that an infinite word $x$ has exactly $n+1$ distinct factors of each
length $n$ if and only if $x$ is binary, aperiodic and balanced, i.e., $x$ is a
Sturmian word. In this paper we obtain a broad generalization of the
Morse-Hedlund theorem via group actions. Given a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric
group $S_n, $ let $1\leq \epsilon(G)\leq n$ denote the number of distinct
$G$-orbits of $\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}.$ Since $G$ is a subgroup of $S_n,$ it acts on
$A^n=\{a_1a_2\cdots a_n\,|\,a_i\in A\}$ by permutation. Thus, given an infinite
word $x\in A^N$ and an infinite sequence $\omega=(G_n)_{n\geq 1}$ of subgroups
$G_n \subseteq S_n,$ we consider the complexity function $p_{\omega ,x}:N
\rightarrow N$ which counts for each length $n$ the number of equivalence
classes of factors of $x$ of length $n$ under the action of $G_n.$ We show that
if $x$ is aperiodic, then $p_{\omega, x}(n)\geq\epsilon(G_n)+1$ for each $n\geq
1,$ and moreover, if equality holds for each $n,$ then $x$ is Sturmian.
Conversely, let $x$ be a Sturmian word. Then for every infinite sequence
$\omega=(G_n)_{n\geq 1}$ of Abelian subgroups $G_n \subseteq S_n,$ there exists
$\omega '=(G_n')_{n\geq 1}$ such that for each $n\geq 1:$ $G_n'\subseteq S_n$
is isomorphic to $G_n$ and $p_{\omega',x}(n)=\epsilon(G'_n)+1.$ Applying the
above results to the sequence $(Id_n)_{n\geq 1},$ where $Id_n$ is the trivial
subgroup of $S_n$ consisting only of the identity, we recover both directions
of the Morse-Hedland theorem.

not respond linearly to mitigation attempts. A more apt model entails ordinary
people who neither commit nor sanction crime as the third strategy besides the
criminals and punishers. Since ordinary people free-ride on the sanctioning
efforts of punishers, they may introduce cyclic dominance that enables the
coexistence of all three competing strategies. In this setup ordinary
individuals become the biggest impediment to crime abatement. We therefore also
consider heterogeneous punisher strategies, which seek to reduce their
investment into fighting crime in order to attain a more competitive payoff. We
show that this diversity of punishment leads to an explosion of complexity in
the system, where the benefits and pitfalls of criminal behavior are revealed
in the most unexpected ways. Due to the raise and fall of different alliances
no less than six consecutive phase transitions occur in dependence on solely
the temptation to succumb to criminal behavior, leading the population from
ordinary people-dominated across punisher-dominated to crime-dominated phases,

classification scheme of cities based on the economic behavior of their
residents. First, we study how individual spending behavior is qualitatively
and quantitatively affected by various factors such as customer's age, gender,
and size of a home city. We show that, similar to other socioeconomic urban
quantities, individual spending activity exhibits a statistically significant
superlinear scaling with city size. With respect to the general trends, we
quantify the distinctive signature of each city in terms of residents' spending
behavior, independently from the effects of scale and demographic
heterogeneity. Based on the comparison of city signatures, we build a novel
classification of cities across Spain in three categories. That classification
is, with few exceptions, stable over different ways of city definition and
connects with a meaningful socioeconomic interpretation. Furthermore, it
appears to be related with the ability of cities to attract foreign visitors,
which is a particularly remarkable finding given that the classification was
based exclusively on the behavioral patterns of city residents. This highlights
the far-reaching applicability of the presented classification approach and its
ability to discover patterns that go beyond the quantities directly involved in

applying the probability density functions (PDFs) and the spatial density power
spectrum to synthetic column density maps. We find that there exists three
characterizable stages of the evolution of the collapsing cloud which we term
""early,"" ""intermediate,"" and ""advanced."" At early times, i.e. $t<0.15t_{ff}$,
the column density has a power spectral slope similar to nongravitating
supersonic turbulence and a lognormal distribution. At an intermediate stage,
i.e. $0.15t_{ff}< t \leq 0.35t_{ff}$, there exists signatures of the prestellar
cores in the shallower PDF and power spectrum power law slopes. The column
density PDF power law tails at these times have line of sight averaged slopes
ranging from -2.5 to -1.5 with shallower values belonging to simulations with
lower magnetic field strength. The density power spectrum slope becomes shallow
and can be characterized by $P(k)=A_1k^{\beta_2}e^{-k/k_c}$, where $A_1$
describes the amplitude, $k^{\beta_2}$ describes the classical power law
behavior and the scale $k_c$ characterizes the turn over from turbulence
dominated to self-gravity dominated. At advanced stages of collapse, i.e.
$\approx t>0.35t_{ff}$, the power spectral slope is positive valued, and a
dramatic increase is observed in the PDF moments and the Tsallis incremental
PDF parameters, which gives rise to deviations between PDF-sonic Mach number
relations. Finally, we show that the imprint of gravity on the density power
spectrum can be replicated in non-gravitating turbulence by introducing a
delta-function with amplitude equivalent to the maximum valued point in a given
self-gravitating map. We find that the turbulence power spectrum restored
through spatial filtering of the high density material.

density is a nonincreasing function of the radius and the fluid is a perfect
fluid, and on the configuration, such as the exterior is the Schwarzschild
solution, found that the radius $r_0$ to mass $m$ ratio of a star would obey
the Buchdahl bound $r_0/m\geq9/4$. He noted that the bound was saturated by the
Schwarzschild interior solution, the solution with $\rho_{\rm m}(r)= {\rm
constant}$, where $\rho_{\rm m}(r)$ is the energy density of the matter at $r$,
when the central central pressure blows to infinity. Generalizations of this
bound have been studied. One generalization was given by Andr\'easson by
including electrically charged matter and imposing that $p+2p_T \leq\rho_{\rm
m}$, where $p$ is the radial pressure and $p_T$ the tangential pressure. His
bound is given by $r_0/m\geq9/\left(1+\sqrt{1+3\,q^2/r_0^2}\right)^{2}$, the
Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound, with $q$ being the star's total electric charge.
Following Andr\'easson's proof, the configuration that saturates the Buchdahl
bound is an uncharged shell, rather than the Schwarzschild interior solution.
By extension, the configurations that saturate the Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound
are charged shells. One expects then, in turn, that there should exist an
electrically charged equivalent to the interior Schwarzschild limit. We find
here that this equivalent is provided by the equation $\rho_{\rm m}(r) +
{Q^2(r)}/ {\left(8\pi\,r^4\right)}= {\rm constant}$, where $Q(r)$ is the
electric charge at $r$. This equation was put forward by Cooperstock and de la
Cruz, and Florides, and realized in Guilfoyle's stars. When the central
pressure goes to infinity Guilfoyle's stars are configurations that saturate
the Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound. It remains to find a proof in Buchdahl's
manner such that these configurations are the limiting configurations of the
bound.

$M_* \gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We deconvolve the effects of photometric

confusion using a novel hierarchical Bayesian formalism that is generally
applicable to any combination of photometric and spectroscopic observables. For
an L-$\sigma$ relation of the form $L \propto \sigma^{\beta}$, we find $\beta =
7.8 \pm 1.1$ for $\sigma$ corrected to the effective radius, and a very small
intrinsic scatter of $s = 0.047 \pm 0.004$ in $\log_{10} \sigma$ at fixed $L$.
No significant redshift evolution is found for these parameters. The evolution
of the zero-point within the redshift range considered is consistent with the

characterize different topological phases of matter. Besides the Hall
conductance, the Hall viscosity is another example of such a response that
measures how electronic wave functions respond to changes in the underlying
geometry. Topological (Chern) insulators are known to have a quantized Hall
conductance. A natural question is how the Hall viscosity behaves for these
materials. So far, most of studies on the Hall viscosity of Chern insulators
have focused on the continuum limit. The presence of lattice breaks the
continuous translational symmetry to a discrete group and this causes two
complications: it introduces a new length scale associated with the lattice
constant, and makes the momentum periodic. We develop two different methods of
how to implement a lattice deformation: (1) a lattice distortion is encoded as
a shift in the lattice momentum, and (2) a lattice deformation is treated
microscopically in the gradient expansion of the hopping matrix elements. After
establishing the method of deformation we can compute the Hall viscosity
through a linear response (Kubo) formula. We examine these methods for three
models: the Hofstadter model, the Chern insulator, and the surface of a 3D
topological insulator. Our results in certain regimes of parameters, where the
continuum limit is relevant, are in agreement with previous calculations. We
also provide possible experimental signatures of the Hall viscosity by studying

governed by the destructive interference of two amplitudes, one of which
involves the Higgs coupling to the quark anti-quark pair inside the vector

factorization, including the resummation of large logarithmic corrections and
accounting for the effects of flavor mixing. The high factorization scale
\mu~m_h ensures that our results are rather insensitive to the hadronic

h\gamma\gamma* and h\gamma Z* couplings, where the off-shell gauge boson
converts into the vector meson. We devise a strategy to eliminate theoretical
uncertainties related to this amplitude to almost arbitrary precision. This
opens up the possibility to probe for O(1) modifications of the c- and b-quark

accompanied by the flaring of the mm-VLBI core and subsequent ejection of a new
superluminal component. However, not all ejections of components are associated
with gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi. Clear gamma-ray detections are
obtained only when components are moving in a direction closer to our line of
sight.This suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission depends not only on
the interaction of moving components with the mm-VLBI core, but also on their
orientation with respect to the observer. Timing of the gamma-ray detections
and ejection of superluminal components locate the gamma-ray production to
within almost 0.13 pc from the mm-VLBI core, which was previously estimated to
lie about 0.24 pc from the central black hole. This corresponds to about twice
the estimated extension of the broad line region, limiting the external photon
field and therefore suggesting synchrotron self Compton as the most probable
mechanism for the production of the gamma-ray emission. Alternatively, the

ionised gas is at a different line-of-sight velocity to their host galaxies,
with the SAMI integral field spectrograph (IFS). One of the galaxies shows gas
kinematics very different to the stellar kinematics, indicating a recent merger
or accretion event. We demonstrate that the star formation associated with this
event was triggered within the last 100 Myr. The other galaxy shows simple disc
rotation in both gas and stellar kinematics, aligned with each other, but in
the central region has signatures of an outflow driven by the AGN. Other than
the outflow, neither galaxy shows any discontinuity in the ionised gas
kinematics at the galaxy's centre. We conclude that in these two cases there is
no direct evidence of the AGN being in a supermassive black hole binary system.
Our study demonstrates that selecting kinematically offset AGN from
single-fibre spectroscopy provides, by definition, samples of kinematically
peculiar objects, but IFS or other data are required to determine their true
nature.

capabilities, it is common for images being uploaded to the Internet today to
have GPS coordinates associated with them. In addition to research that tries
to predict GPS coordinates from visual features, this also opens up the door to
problems that are conditioned on the availability of GPS coordinates. In this
work, we tackle the problem of performing image classification with location
context, in which we are given the GPS coordinates for images in both the train
and test phases. We explore different ways of encoding and extracting features
from the GPS coordinates, and show how to naturally incorporate these features
into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the current state-of-the-art for
most image classification and recognition problems. We also show how it is
possible to simultaneously learn the optimal pooling radii for a subset of our
features within the CNN framework. To evaluate our model and to help promote
research in this area, we identify a set of location-sensitive concepts and
annotate a subset of the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100M dataset that has
GPS coordinates with these concepts, which we make publicly available. By
leveraging location context, we are able to achieve almost a 7% gain in mean

reduces computing time, allows for the derivation of analytical formulas, and
provides fast and objective insights about the optimization problem under

solutions to nonlinear PDE-constrained inverse problems. The aim is to merge
ideas from iterative regularization with ensemble Kalman methods from Bayesian
inference to develop a derivative-free stable method easy to implement in
applications where the PDE (forward) model is only accessible as a black box.
The method can be derived as an approximation of the regularizing
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) scheme [14] in which the derivative of the forward
operator and its adjoint are replaced with empirical covariances from an
ensemble of elements from the admissible space of solutions. The resulting
ensemble method consists of an update formula that is applied to each ensemble
member and that has a regularization parameter selected in a similar fashion to
the one in the LM scheme. Moreover, an early termination of the scheme is
proposed according to a discrepancy principle-type of criterion. The proposed
method can be also viewed as a regularizing version of standard Kalman
approaches which are often unstable unless ad-hoc fixes, such as covariance
localization, are implemented. We provide a numerical investigation of the
conditions under which the proposed method inherits the regularizing properties
of the LM scheme of [14]. More concretely, we study the effect of ensemble
size, number of measurements, selection of initial ensemble and tunable
parameters on the performance of the method. The numerical investigation is
carried out with synthetic experiments on two model inverse problems: (i)
identification of conductivity on a Darcy flow model and (ii) electrical
impedance tomography with the complete electrode model. We further demonstrate
the potential application of the method in solving shape identification
problems by means of a level-set approach for the parameterization of unknown

of precise galaxy redshifts for density mapping and the prevalence of star
formation before quenching, nearly all the proto-clusters known to date were
confirmed by spectroscopy of galaxies with strong emission lines. Therefore,
large emission-line galaxy surveys provide an efficient way to identify
proto-clusters directly. Here we report the discovery of a large-scale
structure at z = 2.44 in the HETDEX Pilot Survey. On a scale of a few tens of
Mpc comoving, this structure shows a complex overdensity of Lya emitters (LAE),
which coincides with broad-band selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA
photometric and zCOSMOS spectroscopic catalogs, as well as overdensities of
intergalactic gas revealed in the Lya absorption maps of Lee et al. (2014). We
construct mock LAE catalogs to predict the cosmic evolution of this structure.
We find that such an overdensity should have already broken away from the
Hubble flow, and part of the structure will collapse to form a galaxy cluster
with 10^14.5 +- 0.4 M_sun by z = 0. The structure contains a higher median
stellar mass of broad-band selected galaxies, a boost of extended Lya nebulae,
and a marginal excess of active galactic nuclei relative to the field,
supporting a scenario of accelerated galaxy evolution in cluster progenitors.
Based on the correlation between galaxy overdensity and the z = 0 descendant
halo mass calibrated in the simulation, we predict that several hundred 1.9 < z
< 3.5 proto-clusters with z = 0 mass of > 10^14.5 M_sun will be discovered in
the 8.5 Gpc^3 of space surveyed by the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy

schedulability-test framework, called k2Q (k to Q). It provides automatic
constructions of closed-form quadratic bounds or utilization bounds for a wide
range of applications in real-time systems under fixed-priority scheduling. The
key of the framework is a $k$-point schedulability test or a $k$-point response
time analysis that is based on the utilizations and the execution times of
$k-1$ higher-priority tasks. The natural condition of k2Q is a quadratic form
for testing the schedulability or analyzing the response time. The response
time analysis and the schedulability analysis provided by the framework can be
viewed as a ""blackbox"" interface that can result in sufficient
utilization-based analysis. Since the framework is independent from the task
and platform models, it can be applied to a wide range of applications.
  We show the generality of k2Q by applying it to several different task
models. k2Q produces better uniprocessor and/or multiprocessor schedulability
tests not only for the traditional sporadic task model, but also more
expressive task models such as the generalized multi-frame task model and the
acyclic task model. Another interesting contribution is that in the past,
exponential-time schedulability tests were typically not recommended and most
of time ignored due to high complexity. We have successfully shown that
exponential-time schedulability tests may lead to good polynomial-time tests
(almost automatically) by using the k2Q framework.

the spectrum becomes unstable against a growth of scalar-mode excitations (a

the Pomeranchuk instability may be tamed by the formation of a static Bose

reanalyze time-series data on cellular reprogramming from differentiated cell

dynamics during reprogramming follow a simple one-dimensional reaction

Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that such a reaction coordinate emerges
naturally from epigenetic landscape models of cell identity where cellular
reprogramming is viewed as a ""barrier-crossing"" between the starting and ending
cell fates. The model also provides gene-level insight into reprogramming
dynamics and resolves a debate in the stem cell field about the different

Non-agglomerated nanowires (with length L and diameter d) with a controlled
shape going from quasi perfect cylinders to diabolos, have been studied inside
their polyol solution in order to avoid any oxidation process. The coercive
field HC was found to follow a standard behavior and to be optimized for an
aspect ratio L/d > 15. Interestingly, an unexpected behavior was observed as
function of the head morphology leading to the strange situation where a
diabolo shaped nanowire is a better nanomagnet than a cylinder. This
paradoxical behavior can be ascribed to the growth-competition between the
aspect ratio L/d and the head morphology ratio d/D (D being the head width).
Our experimental results clearly show the importance of the independent
parameter (t = head thickness) that needs to be considered in addition to the
shape aspect ratio (L/d) in order to fully describe the nanomagnets magnetic
behavior. Micromagnetic simulations well support the experimental results and

a collection of columns, and the height of the column first hit by the walk
immediately grows by one unit. Thus, columns do not grow laterally.
  We prove that there is a critical time scale $N/\log(N)$ for the maximal
height of the piles, i.e., there exist constants $\alpha<\beta$ such that the
maximal pile height at time $\alpha N/\log(N)$ is of order $\log(N)$, while at
time $\beta N/\log(N)$ is larger than $N^\chi$. This suggests that a

relationship between the potential of longevity and the structural complexity
of an organism is analyzed. I. The potential of longevity is the maximum
lifespan of an organism if it lives in an ideal environment. The longevity of
an organism includes two parts: the time for development (development time) and
the time for structure-maintenance (maintenance time). II. The development time
of an organism depends on its structural complexity. The maintenance time is
related to two factors: the degree of damage-exposure and the potential of
functionality for structure-maintenance. The potential of functionality is
built in structural complexity. Since both of development time and maintenance
time are determined by structural complexity, the potential of longevity of an
organism is hidden in structural complexity. III. The individuals of different
species have different potentials of longevity because they have different
structural complexities. An animal has limited longevity because it has limited
structural complexity. Limited structural complexity and limited longevity are
essential for the survival of a species. IV. Despite having the same potential
of longevity, the individuals of a species can have different lifespans. The
lifespan of an individual is more related to the degree of damage-exposure,
which is determined by the living environment and the living habit of the
individual. In conclusion, the potential of longevity of an organism is hidden
in structural complexity, but the real lifespan of an organism is more related
to the living environment.

Centroid Molecular Dynamics (CMD) quantum simulations of the velocity
autocorrelation function, calculations of the total neutron cross section (TCS)
remarkably agree with experimental data at the thermal and epithermal incident
neutron energies where para-H2 dynamics is actually dominated by the self
contributions. This result shows that a proper account of the quantum nature of
the fluid, as provided by CMD, is a necessary and very effective condition to
obtain the correct absolute-scale cross section values directly from
first-principle computations of the double differential cross section, and
without the need of introducing any empirically adjusted quantity. At
subthermal incident energies, appropriate modeling of the para-H2
intermolecular (distinct) dynamics also becomes crucial, but quantum
simulations are not yet able to cope with it. Existing simple models which
account for the distinct part provide an appropriate correction of self-only
calculations and bring the computed results in reasonable accord with TCS
experimental data available until very recently. However, if just published
cross section measurements in the cold range are considered, the agreement
turns out to be by far superior and very satisfactory. The possible origin of
slight residual differences will be commented and suggest further computational
and experimental efforts. Nonetheless, the ability to reproduce the total cross

toward Rho Oph and Orion H_2 Peak 1 have yielded detections of any statistical
significance. The detection of the O_2 N_J =3_3 -1_2 and 5_4 - 3_4 lines at
487.249 GHz and 773.840 GHz, respectively, toward Rho Ophiuchus has been
attributed to a short-lived peak in the time-dependent, cold-cloud O_2
abundance, while the detection of the O_2 N_J =3_3 - 1_2, 5_4 - 3_4 lines, plus
the 7_6 - 5_6 line at 1120.715 GHz, toward Orion has been ascribed to
time-dependent preshock physical and chemical evolution and low-velocity (12
km/s) non-dissociative C-type shocks, both of which are fully shielded from
far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, plus a postshock region that is exposed to a
FUV field. We report a re-interpretation of the Orion O_2 detection based on
new C-type shock models that fully incorporate the significant effects the
presence of even a weak FUV field can have on the preshock gas, shock structure
and postshock chemistry. In particular, we show that a family of solutions
exists, depending on the FUV intensity, that reproduces both the observed O_2
intensities and O_2 line ratios. The solution in closest agreement with the
shock parameters inferred for H_2 Peak 1 from other gas tracers assumes a 23
km/s shock impacting gas with a preshock density of 8x10^4 cm^-3 and G_0 =1,
substantially different from that inferred for the fully-shielded shock case.
As pointed out previously, the similarity between the LSR velocity of all three
O_2 lines (~11 km/s) and recently measured H_2O 5_32 - 4_41 maser emission at
620.701 GHz toward H_2 Peak 1 suggests that the O_2 emission arises behind the
same shocks responsible for the maser emission, though the O_2 emission is
almost certainly more extended than the localized high density maser spots

correlated in space. The sharp interface limit as the parameter $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0$ of the stochastic equation formally approximates a stochastic
mean curvature flow which is described by a stochastically perturbed geometric
law of the deterministic mean curvature flow. Both the stochastic Allen-Cahn
equation and the stochastic mean curvature flow arise from materials science,
fluid mechanics and cell biology applications. Two fully discrete finite
element methods which are based on different time-stepping strategies for the
nonlinear term are proposed. Strong convergence with sharp rates for both fully
discrete finite element methods is proved. This is done with a crucial help of
the H\""{o}lder continuity in time with respect to the spatial $L^2$-norm and
$H^1$-seminorm for the strong solution of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation,
which are key technical lemmas proved in paper. It also relies on the fact that
high moments of the strong solution are bounded in various spatial and temporal
norms. Numerical experiments are provided to gauge the performance of the
proposed fully discrete finite element methods and to study the interplay of
the geometric evolution and gradient-type noises.

  theory derivation","41 pages. Submitted to PRD",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.92.064040",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate the motion of small compact objects in
non-vacuum spacetimes using methods from effective field theory in curved
spacetime. Although a vacuum formulation is sufficient in many astrophysical
contexts, there are applications such as the role of the self-force in
enforcing cosmic-censorship in the context of the overcharging problem, which
necessitate an extension into the non-vacuum regime. The defining feature of
the self-force problem in non-vacuum spacetimes is the coupling between
gravitational and non-gravitational field perturbations. The formulation of the
self-force problem for non-vacuum spacetimes was recently provided in
simultaneous papers by Zimmerman and Poisson [1] and Linz, Friedmann, Wiseman
[2]. Here we distinguish ourselves by working with the effective action rather
than the field equations. The formalism utilizes the multi-index notation
developed by Zimmerman and Poisson [1] to accommodate the coupling between the
different fields. Using dimensional regularization, we arrive at a finite
expression for the local self-force expressed in terms of multi-index
quantities evaluated in the background spacetime. We then apply the formalism
to compute the coupled gravitational self-force in two explicit cases. First,
we calculate the self-force on a massive particle possessing scalar charge and
moving in an scalarvac spacetime. We then derive an expression for the
self-force on an electrically charged, massive particle moving in an electrovac
spacetime. In both cases, the force is expressed as a sum of local terms
involving tensors defined in the background spacetime and evaluated at the
current position of the particle, as well as tail integrals that depend on the
past history of the particle.

spectropolarimeter is capable of achieving these SNRs on faint targets with the
10m aperture of the Keck telescope, provided several instrumental artifacts can
be suppressed. We describe here several methods to overcome instrumental error
sources that are required to achieve these high SNRs on LRISp. We explore high
SNR techniques such as defocusing and slit-stepping during integration with
high spectral and spatial oversampling. We find that the instrument flexure and
interference fringes introduced by the achromatic retarders create artificial
signals at 0.5\% levels in the red channel which mimic real stellar signals and
limit the sensitivity and calibration stability of LRISp. Careful spectral
extraction and data filtering algorithms can remove these error sources. For
faint targets and long exposures, cosmic ray hits are frequent and present a
major limitation to the upgraded deep depletion red-channel CCD. These must be
corrected to the same high SNR levels, requiring careful spectral extraction
using iterative filtering algorithms. We demonstrate here characterization of
these sources of instrumental polarization artifacts and present several
methods used to successfully overcome these limitations. We have measured the
linear to circular cross-talk and find it to be roughly 5\%, consistent with
the known instrument limitations. We show spectropolarimetric signals on brown

along with the larger biological damage to cancer cells achieved by helium

clustering problem with many applications in both its symmetric and asymmetric
forms. Both versions of the problem have tight approximation factors on worst
case instances. Therefore to improve on these ratios, one must go beyond the
worst case.
  In this work, we take this approach and provide strong positive results both
for the asymmetric and symmetric $k$-center problems under a natural input
stability (promise) condition called $\alpha$-perturbation resilience [Bilu and
Linia 2012], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any
alpha-factor perturbation to the input distances. We provide algorithms that
give strong guarantees simultaneously for stable and non-stable instances: our
algorithms always inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation
algorithms, and output the optimal solution if the input is $2$-perturbation
resilient. Furthermore, we prove our result is tight by showing symmetric
$k$-center under $(2-\epsilon)$-perturbation resilience is hard unless $NP=RP$.
  The impact of our results are multifaceted. This is the first tight result
for any problem under perturbation resilience. Furthermore, our results
illustrate a surprising relationship between symmetric and asymmetric
$k$-center instances under perturbation resilience. Unlike approximation ratio,
for which symmetric $k$-center is easily solved to a factor of 2 but asymmetric
$k$-center cannot be approximated to any constant factor, both symmetric and
asymmetric $k$-center can be solved optimally under resilience to
2-perturbations. Finally, our guarantees in the setting where only part of the
data satisfies perturbation resilience makes these algorithms more applicable
to real-life instances.

localized in the middle between charges and provides overscreening of Coulomb
repulsion between the charges. The size of the resulting macro-molecules is of
the order of the magnetic length ($\sim 10$ nm for magnetic field 10 T). The
possible stable macro-molecules that unit charges can form on graphene in

exceeding mobility barriers for many ionically bond impurities. The influence
of possible lattice-scale effects of valley-mixing are discussed.
  Tuning the doping of graphene or the magnetic field, the binding of

(TE) properties of quantum dot molecules with high figure of merit are
illustrated via the full solution to the Hubbard- Anderson model in the Coulomb
blockade regime. It is found that under certain condition in the triangular QD
molecule (TQDM), destructive quantum interference (QI) can occur, which leads
to vanishing small electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient is
modified dramatically. When TQDM is in the charge localization state due to QI,
the Seebeck coefficient is seriously suppressed at low temperature, but highly
enhanced at high temperature. Meanwhile, the behavior of Lorenz number reveals
that it is easier to block charge transport via destructive QI than the
electron heat transport at high temperatures. The maximum power factor (PF) in
TQDM occurs at full-filling condition. Nevertheless, low-filling condition is
preferred for getting maximum PF in serially coupled triple QDs in general. In
double QDs, the maximum PF can be achieved either with orbital-depletion or
orbital-filling as a result of electron-hole symmetry. Our theoretical work
provides a useful guideline for advancing the nanoscale TE technology.

the width in the momentum direction is large, the peak positions along the (pi,

non-doped La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ (LCO), which is consistent with the previous RIXS
results of cuprate superconductors. Using RIXS at the Cu-$L_3$ edge, we have
measured the dispersion relations of the so-called paramagnon mode along both
(pi, pi) and (pi, 0) directions. Although in both directions the neutron and
RIXS data connect with each other and the paramagnon along (pi, 0) agrees well
with the LCO spin-wave dispersion, the paramagnon in the (pi, pi) direction
probed by RIXS appears to be less dispersive and the excitation energy is lower
than the spin-wave of LCO near (pi/2, pi/2). Thus, our results indicate
consistency between neutron inelastic scattering and RIXS, and elucidate the
entire magnetic excitation in the (pi, pi) direction by the complementary use
of two probes. The polarization dependence of the RIXS profiles indicates that
appreciable charge excitations exist in the same energy range of magnetic
excitations, reflecting the itinerant character of the overdoped sample. A
possible anisotropy in the charge excitation intensity might explain the
apparent differences in the paramagnon dispersion in the (pi, pi) direction as
detected by the X-ray scattering.

distance scales. To fit their light curve shape -- absolute luminosity
relation, one needs to assume an intrinsic color and a likelihood of host
galaxy extinction or a convolution of these, a color distribution prior. The
host galaxy extinction prior is typically assumed to be an exponential drop-off
for the current supernova programs ($P(A_V) \propto e^{-A_V/\tau_0}$). We
explore the validity of this prior using the distribution of extinction values
inferred when two galaxies accidentally overlap (an occulting galaxy pair). We
correct the supernova luminosity distances from the SDSS-III Supernova projects
(SDSS-SN) by matching the host galaxies to one of three templates from
occulting galaxy pairs based on the host galaxy mass and the $A_V$-bias -
prior-scale ($\tau_0$) relation from Jha et al. (2007).
  We find that introducing an $A_V$ prior that depends on host mass results in
lowered luminosity distances for the SDSS-SN on average but it does not reduce
the scatter in individual measurements. This points, in our view, to the need
for many more occulting galaxy templates to match to SNIa host galaxies to rule
out this possible source of scatter in the SNIa distance measurements. We match
occulting galaxy templates based on both mass and projected radius and we find
that one should match by stellar mass first with radius as a secondary
consideration. We discuss the caveats of the current approach and our aim is to
convince the reader that a library of occulting galaxy pairs observed with HST
will provide sufficient priors to improve (optical) SNIa measurements to the
next required accuracy in Cosmology.

high-level formal specification. In recent times, effective formal synthesis
methods have been proposed based on the use of inductive learning. We refer to
this class of methods that learn programs from examples as formal inductive
synthesis. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for formal
inductive synthesis. We discuss how formal inductive synthesis differs from
traditional machine learning. We then describe oracle-guided inductive
synthesis (OGIS), a framework that captures a family of synthesizers that
operate by iteratively querying an oracle. An instance of OGIS that has had
much practical impact is counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We
present a theoretical characterization of CEGIS for learning any program that
computes a recursive language. In particular, we analyze the relative power of
CEGIS variants where the types of counterexamples generated by the oracle
varies. We also consider the impact of bounded versus unbounded memory
available to the learning algorithm. In the special case where the universe of
candidate programs is finite, we relate the speed of convergence to the notion
of teaching dimension studied in machine learning theory. Altogether, the
results of the paper take a first step towards a theoretical foundation for the
emerging field of formal inductive synthesis.

model, which posits that a massive seed BH forms through gravitational collapse
of a $\sim 10^5~M_\odot$ SMS. We study the evolution of such a SMS growing by
rapid mass accretion. In particular, we examine the impact of time-dependent
mass accretion of repeating burst and quiescent phases that are expected to
occur with a self-gravitating circumstellar disk. We show that the stellar
evolution with such episodic accretion differs qualitatively from that expected
with a constant accretion rate, even if the mean accretion rate is the same.
Unlike the case of constant mass accretion, whereby the star expands roughly
following $R_* \simeq 2.6 \times 10^3 R_\odot (M_*/100~M_\odot)^{1/2}$, the
protostar can substantially contract during the quiescent phases between
accretion bursts. The stellar effective temperature and ionizing photon
emissivity increase accordingly as the star contracts, which can cause strong
ionizing feedback and halt the mass accretion onto the star. With a fixed
duration of the quiescent phase $\Delta t_{\rm q}$, such contraction occurs in
early evolutionary phases, i.e. for $M_* \lesssim 10^3~M_\odot$ with $\Delta
t_{\rm q} \simeq 10^3$ yr. For later epochs and larger masses but the same
$\Delta t_{\rm q}$, contraction is negligible even during quiescent phases.
With larger quiescent times $\Delta t_{\rm q}$, however, the star continues to
contract during quiescent phases even for the higher stellar masses. We show
that such behavior is well understood by comparing the interval time and the
thermal relaxation time for a bloated surface layer. We conclude that the UV
radiative feedback becomes effective if the quiescent phase associated by the
burst accretion is longer than $\sim 10^3$ yr, which is possible in an
accretion disk forming in the direct collapse model.

the absorber thickness ranging from a few hundreds of micrometers (conventional
wafer-based cells) to devices as thin as $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. In this work, we
use a model single-junction solar cell to calculate the limits of energy
conversion efficiency and estimate the optimal absorber thickness. The limiting
efficiency for cells in the thickness range between 40 and $500\,\mu\mathrm{m}$
is very similar and close to 29%. In this regard, we argue that decreasing the
thickness below around $40\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ is counter-productive, as it
significantly reduces the maximum achievable efficiency, even when optimal
light trapping is implemented. We analyse the roles of incomplete light
trapping and extrinsic (bulk and surface) recombination mechanisms. For a
reasonably high material quality, consistent with present-day fabrication
techniques, the optimal thickness is always higher than a few tens of
micrometers. We identify incomplete light trapping and parasitic losses as a
major roadblock in improving the efficiency upon the current record of 25.6%
for silicon solar cells. Finally, considering the main parameters that impact
solar cell performance, we quantify the constraints and requirements for
achieving a specified energy conversion efficiency, which is important for a
proper design strategy of high efficiency silicon solar cells.

in nature with weighted edges. Such networks are routinely dichotomized in the
interest of using available methods for statistical inference with networks.
The generalized exponential random graph model (GERGM) is a recently proposed
method used to simulate and model the edges of a weighted graph. The GERGM
specifies a joint distribution for an exponential family of graphs with
continuous-valued edge weights. However, current estimation algorithms for the
GERGM only allow inference on a restricted family of model specifications. To
address this issue, we develop a Metropolis--Hastings method that can be used
to estimate any GERGM specification, thereby significantly extending the family
of weighted graphs that can be modeled with the GERGM. We show that new
flexible model specifications are capable of avoiding likelihood degeneracy and
efficiently capturing network structure in applications where such models were
not previously available. We demonstrate the utility of this new class of
GERGMs through application to two real network data sets, and we further assess
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by simulating non-degenerate
model specifications from the well-studied two-stars model. A working R version

decay channel with a much larger rate than for the decay into gravitinos. This
reduces the branching ratio for the decay of the waterfall field into
gravitinos. (ii) The inflaton generically decays later than the waterfall

of the gravitino population from the decays of the waterfall field. The
combination of both effects generically leads to a strongly reduced gravitino

to obtain the salient patches which contain discriminative features for

affecting a non-trivial portion of the population (which decreases associated
authentication accuracy), we designed and tested a multifinger, multiphalanx
fusion scheme, that combines minutiae matching scores originating from
non-distal (ie. middle and proximal) phalanges based on (i) simple sum fusion,
(ii) NFIQ image-quality-based fusion, and (iii) phalanx-type-based fusion.
Utilizing a medium-size (50 individuals, 400 unique fingers, 1600 distinct

where (i) distal phalanx images are not usable (e.g. due to missing digits, or
low quality finger surface due to manual labor), and (ii) switching to a new
biometric modality (e.g. iris) is not possible due to economical or

fact usable, combining them with images from other phalanges increases accuracy

of activity. We show that, in spite of having a similar spectral and timing
behaviour in the energy range between 3 and 30 keV, these three outbursts show
pronounced differences above 30 keV. In fact, the 2010 outburst extends at high
energies without any detectable cut-off until 150-200 keV, while the two
previous outbursts that occurred in 2006 and 2008 are not detected at all above
30 keV. Thus, in spite of a very similar accretion disk evolution, these three
outbursts exhibit totally different characteristics of the Compton electron
corona, showing a softening in their evolution rarely observed before in a low

unknown perturbation that causes the outbursts to be equally spaced in time
could be at the origin of this particular behaviour. Finally we describe
several possible scenarios that could explain the regularity of the outbursts,
identifying the most plausible, such as a third body orbiting around the binary

originating from the classical midpoint method on $T^*\mathbf{R}^{2n}$ for a
collective Hamiltonian. Symplecticity is then a direct, geometric consequence.

chemical properties as exemplified in various two-dimensional (2D) crystals
extending from graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides to black phosphorous.
This is caused by the dramatic modification of electronic band structures. In
such reduced dimensions, the electron correlation effects are also expected to
be significantly changed from bulk systems. However, there are few attempts to
realize novel phenomena in correlated 2D crystals. Here, we report memristive
phase switching in nano-thick crystals of 1T-type tantalum disulfide (1T-TaS2),
a first-order phase transition system. The ordering kinetics of the phase
transition was revealed to become extremely slow as the thickness is reduced,
resulting in an emergence of metastable states. Furthermore, we realized the
unprecedented memristive switching to multi-step non-volatile states by
applying in-plane electric field. The reduction of thickness is essential to
achieve such non-volatile electrical switching behavior. The thinning-induced
slow kinetics possibly makes the various metastable states robust and
consequently realizes the non-volatile memory operation. The present result
indicates that 2D crystal with correlated electrons is a novel nano-system to
explore and functionalize multiple metastable states which are inaccessible in
its bulk form.

somehow neglected in the past because of intrinsic difficulties in its study,
due, e.g., to crowding and high extinction. Open clusters located in the inner
disc are among the best tracers of its chemistry at different ages and
distances. Aims. We analyse the chemical patterns of four open clusters located
within 7 kpc of the Galactic Centre and of field stars to infer the properties
of the inner disc with the Gaia-ESO survey idr2/3 data release. Methods. We
derive the parameters of the newly observed cluster, Berkeley 81, finding an
age of about 1 Gyr and a Galactocentric distance of 5.4 kpc. We construct the
chemical patterns of clusters and we compare them with those of field stars in
the Solar neighbourhood and in the inner-disc samples. Results. Comparing the
three populations we observe that inner-disc clusters and field stars are both,
on average, enhanced in [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe]. Using the idr2/3 results
of M67, we estimate the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effect on
the abundances of Mg and Si in giant stars. After empirically correcting for
NLTE effects, we note that NGC 6705 and Be 81 still have a high [{\alpha}/Fe].
Conclusions. The location of the four open clusters and of the field population
reveals that the evolution of the metallicity [Fe/H] and of [alpha/Fe] can be
explained within the framework of a simple chemical evolution model: both
[Fe/H] and [{\alpha}/Fe] of Trumpler 20 and of NGC 4815 are in agreement with
expectations from a simple chemical evolution model. On the other hand, NGC
6705, and at a lower level Berkeley 81, have higher [{\alpha}/Fe] than expected
for their ages, location in the disc, and metallicity. These differences might
originate from local enrichment processes as explained in the inhomogeneous
evolution framework.

  (https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/13922)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As wireless communication becomes an ever-more evolving and pervasive part of
the existing world, system capacity and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning
are becoming more critically evident. In order to improve system capacity and
QoS, it is mandatory that we pay closer attention to operational bandwidth
efficiency issues. We address this issue for two operators' spectrum sharing in
the same geographical area.
  We model and analyze interactions between the competitive operators
coexisting in the same frequency band as a strategic noncooperative game, where
the operators simultaneously share the spectrum dynamically as per their
relative requirement. If resources are allocated in a conventional way (static
orthogonal allocation), spectrum utilization becomes inefficient when there is
load asymmetry between the operators and low inter-operator interference.
  Theoretically, operators can share resources in a cooperative manner, but
pragmatically they are reluctant to reveal their network information to
competitors. By using game theory, we design a distributed implementation, in
which self-interested operators play strategies and contend for the spectrum
resources in a noncooperative manner. We have proposed two game theoretic
approaches in the thesis, one using a virtual carrier price; and the other
based on a mutual history of favors. The former approach takes into account a
penalty proportional to spectrum usage in its utility function, whereas in the
latter, operators play strategies based on their history of interactions, i.e.,
how well the other behaved in the past. Finally, based on the simulations, we
assess the performance of the proposed game theoretic approaches in comparison
to existing conventional allocations.

In our hence ""model-independent,"" or ""cosmographic"" study, we fit functions to
$d_{L}(z)$ rather than $a(t)$, since $d_{L}(z)$ is what is measured. We find
that the acceleration history of the universe cannot be reliably determined in
this approach due to the irregularity and parametrization-dependence of the
results.
  However, adding the GRB data to the dataset cures most of the irregularities,
at the cost of compromising the model-independent nature of the study slightly.
Then we can determine the redshift of transition to cosmic acceleration as
$z_{\rm t} \sim 0.50 \pm 0.09$ for a flat universe (larger for positive spatial
curvature).
  If Einstein gravity (GR) is assumed, we find a redshift at which the density
of the universe predicted from the $d_{L}(z)$ data is independent of curvature.
We use this point to derive an upper limit on matter density, hence a lower
limit on the density of dark energy. While these limits do not improve the
generally accepted ones, they are derived *only using the $d_{L}(z)$ data*.

SpT and Av for all the targets, and then we determined their physical
parameters. All the objects but one have M*<0.6 Msun, and 8 have mass below or
close to the hydrogen-burning limit. Using the intensity of various emission
lines present in their spectra, we determined the Lacc and Macc for all the
objects. When compared with previous works targeting the same sample, we find
that, in general, these objects are not as strongly accreting as previously
reported, and we suggest that the reason is our more accurate estimate of the
photospheric parameters. We also compare our findings with recent works in
other slightly older star-forming regions to investigate possible differences
in the accretion properties, but we find that the accretion properties for our
targets have the same dependence on the stellar and substellar parameters as in
the other regions. This leads us to conclude that we do not find evidence for a
different dependence of Macc with M* when comparing low-mass stars and BDs.
Moreover, we find a similar small (1 dex) scatter in the Macc-M* relation as in
some of our recent works in other star-forming regions, and no significant
differences in Macc due to different ages or properties of the regions. The
latter result suffers, however, from low statistics and sample selection biases
in the current studies. The small scatter in the Macc-M* correlation confirms
that Macc in the literature based on uncertain photospheric parameters and
single accretion indicators, such as the Ha width, can lead to a scatter that
is unphysically large. Our studies show that only broadband spectroscopic
surveys coupled with a detailed analysis of the photospheric and accretion
properties allows us to properly study the evolution of disk accretion rates.

important independent constraints on their internal structure and dynamics.
Seismic models of these oscillations are used to connect structure and rotation
of the star to its resonant frequencies, which are then compared with
observations, the goal being that of minimizing the difference between the two.
Even in the case of the Sun, for which structure models are highly tuned,
observed frequencies show systematic deviations from modeled frequencies, a
phenomenon referred to as the ""surface term."" The dominant source of this
systematic effect is thought to be vigorous near-surface convection, which is
not well accounted for in both stellar modeling and mode-oscillation physics.
Here we bring to bear the method of homogenization, applicable in the
asymptotic limit of large wavelengths (in comparison to the correlation scale
of convection), to characterize the effect of small-scale surface convection on
resonant-mode frequencies in the Sun. We show that the full oscillation
equations, in the presence of temporally stationary 3-D flows, can be reduced
to an effective ""quiet-Sun"" wave equation with altered sound speed,
Br\""{u}nt--V\""{a}is\""{a}la frequency and Lamb frequency. We derive the modified
equation and relations for the appropriate averaging of three dimensional flows
and thermal quantities to obtain the properties of this effective medium. Using
flows obtained from three dimensional numerical simulations of near-surface
convection, we quantify their effect on solar oscillation frequencies, and find
that they are shifted systematically and substantially. We argue therefore that
consistent interpretations of resonant frequencies must include modifications
to the wave equation that effectively capture the impact of vigorous
hydrodynamic convection.

shocks due to the radio jet is observed at locations co-spatial with the radio
hotspots at 0.5"" northeast and 0.6"" southwest of the nucleus, as evidenced by
the emission-line ratio and gas kinematics. The stellar kinematics shows
rotation with an amplitude at 250pc from the nucleus of 200 km/s after

the plane of the galaxy in counter-rotation relative to the stars; (2) an
outflow perpendicular to the radio jet that seems to be due to an equatorial
AGN outflow; (3) turbulence of the gas observed in association with the radio
hot spots, supporting an interaction of the radio jet with the gas of the disk.
We estimated the mass of ionized and warm molecular gas of ~1.3E6 Msun and ~470

due to the displacement of a rigid piston. We observe that the stress within
the packing increases exponentially with the length of accumulated grains, and
show an extension to current analytic models which fits the measured stress.
The micromechanical behaviour is studied for a range of system parameters, and
the limitations of existing analytic models are described. In particular, we
show the smallest sized systems which can be treated using existing models.
Additionally, the effects of increasing piston rate, and variations of the
initial packing fraction, are described.

driving force in the pore has a component oscillating in time, and the
flickering pore is similarly described by an oscillating term in the pore
friction. In addition to numerically solving the model, we derive analytical
approximations that are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Our
results show that by controlling either the force or pore oscillations, the
translocation process can be either sped up or slowed down depending on the
frequency of the oscillations and the characteristic time scale of the process.
We also show that while in the low and high frequency limits the translocation
time $\tau$ follows the established scaling relation with respect to chain
length $N_0$, in the intermediate frequency regime small periodic fluctuations
can have drastic effects on the dynamical scaling. The results can be easily
generalized for non-periodic oscillations and elucidate the role of time

the fact that the exponentially repulsive pair potential has strong virial

are measures of stellar mean density. The separations have been thought to be
mostly constant in the observed range of frequencies. However, detailed
investigation shows that they are not constant, and their variations are not
random but have very strong diagnostic potential for our understanding of
stellar structure and evolution. In this regard, frequencies of the minimum
large separation are very useful tools. From these frequencies, in addition to
the large separation and frequency of maximum amplitude, Y\i ld\i z et al.
recently have developed new methods to find almost all the fundamental stellar
properties. In the present study, we aim to find metallicity and helium
abundances from the frequencies, and generalize the relations given by Y\i ld\i
z et al. for a wider stellar mass range and arbitrary metallicity ($Z$) and
helium abundance ($Y$). We show that the effect of metallicity is {
significant} for most of the fundamental parameters. For stellar mass, for
example, the expression must be multiplied by $(Z/Z_{\sun})^{0.12}$. For
arbitrary helium abundance, $ M \propto (Y/Y_{\sun})^{0.25} $. Methods for
determination of $Z$ and $Y$ from pure asteroseismic quantities are based on
amplitudes (differences between maximum and minimum values of \Dnu) in the
oscillatory component in the spacing of oscillation frequencies. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the difference between the first maximum and the second
minimum is very sensitive to $Z$. It also depends on $\nu_{\rm min1}/\nu_{\rm
max}$ and small separation between the frequencies. Such a dependence leads us
to develop a method to find $Z$ (and $Y$) from oscillation frequencies. The
maximum difference between the estimated and model $Z$ values is about 14 per
cent. It is 10 per cent for $Y$.

by first principles calculations of phonon spectra for the sake of
interpretation and analysis of the measured phonon spectra in the room
temperature ferroelectric (P63cm) and high temperature paraelectric (P63/mmc)
hexagonal phases of YMnO3. The comparison of the experimental and
first-principles calculated phonon spectra highlight unambiguously a
spin-phonon coupling character in YMnO3. This is further supported by the
pronounced differences in the magnetic and non-magnetic phonon calculations.
The calculated atomistic partial phonon contributions of the Y and Mn atoms are
not affected by inclusion of magnetic interactions, whereas the dynamical
contribution of the O atoms is found tochange. This highlights the role of the
super-exchange interactions between the magnetic Mn cations, mediated by O
bridges. Phonon dispersion relations have also been calculated, in the entire
Brillouin zone, for both the hexagonal phases. In the high-temperature phase,
unstable phonon mode at the K point is highlighted. The displacement pattern at
the K-point indicates that the freezing of this mode along with the stable mode
at the {\Gamma}-point may lead to a stabilization of the low-temperature

the mode Gr\""uneisen parameter and volume thermal expansion behavior. The

validate a method for identifying and characterizing walking in the free-living
environment. We focus on the sustained harmonic walking (SHW), which we define
as walking for at least 10 seconds with low variability of step frequency.
Approach. We utilize the harmonic nature of SHW and quantify local periodicity
of the tri-axial raw accelerometry data. We also estimate fundamental frequency
of observed signals and link it to the instantaneous walking (step-to-step)
frequency (IWF). Next, we report total time spent in SHW, number and durations
of SHW bouts, time of the day when SHW occurred and IWF for 49 healthy, elderly
individuals. Main results. Sensitivity of the proposed classification method
was found to be 97%, while specificity ranged between 87% and 97% and
prediction accuracy between 94% and 97%. We report total time in SHW between
140 and 10 minutes-per-day distributed between 340 and 50 bouts. We estimate
the average IWF to be 1.7 steps-per-second. Significance. We propose a simple
approach for detection of SHW and estimation of IWF, based on Fourier
decomposition. The resulting approach is fast and allows processing of a
week-long raw accelerometry data (approx. 150 million measurements) in
relatively short time (~half an hour) on a common laptop computer (2.8 GHz
Intel Core i7, 16 GB DDR3 RAM).

the H$_2 S(1)-S(3)$, [NeII], [NeIII] emission lines and PAH features. We

size and ionization state of the small grains in the superwind. There are large
variations in the PAH flux ratios throughout the outflow. The 11.3/7.7 and the
6.2/7.7 PAH ratios both vary by more than a factor of five across the wind
region. The Northern part of the wind has a significant population of PAH's
with smaller 6.2/7.7 ratios than either the starburst disk or the Southern
wind, indicating that on average, PAH emitters are larger and more ionized. The
warm molecular gas to PAH flux ratios (H$_2/PAH$) are enhanced in the outflow
by factors of 10-100 as compared to the starburst disk. This enhancement in the
H$_2/PAH$ ratio does not seem to follow the ionization of the atomic gas (as
measured with the [NeIII]/[NeII] line flux ratio) in the outflow. This suggests
that much of the warm H$_2$ in the outflow is excited by shocks. The observed
H$_2$ line intensities can be reproduced with low velocity shocks ($v < 40$ km

predictive performance by learning multiple related
classification/regression/clustering tasks simultaneously. However, solving the
MTFL problem remains challenging when the feature dimension is extremely large.
In this paper, we propose a novel screening rule---that is based on the dual
projection onto convex sets (DPC)---to quickly identify the inactive
features---that have zero coefficients in the solution vectors across all
tasks. One of the appealing features of DPC is that: it is safe in the sense
that the detected inactive features are guaranteed to have zero coefficients in
the solution vectors across all tasks. Thus, by removing the inactive features
from the training phase, we may have substantial savings in the computational
cost and memory usage without sacrificing accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first screening rule that is applicable to sparse models
with multiple data matrices. A key challenge in deriving DPC is to solve a
nonconvex problem. We show that we can solve for the global optimum efficiently
via a properly chosen parametrization of the constraint set. Moreover, DPC has
very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. We
have evaluated the proposed DPC rule on both synthetic and real data sets. The
experiments indicate that DPC is very effective in identifying the inactive
features---especially for high dimensional data---which leads to a speedup up
to several orders of magnitude.

probability can arise. And there is a crossover phenomenon between the two
types of dependence. More specifically, the crossover phenomenon can be induced
by enlarging the contact capacity only when the degree exponent is above a

low rank, i.e., can be expressed as a sum of a small number of rank one
tensors. This motivates us to consider the problem of low rank tensor recovery
from a class of linear measurements called separable measurements. As specific
examples, we focus on two distinct types of separable measurement mechanisms
(a) Random projections, where each measurement corresponds to an inner product
of the tensor with a suitable random tensor, and (b) the completion problem
where measurements constitute revelation of a random set of entries. We present
a computationally efficient algorithm, with rigorous and order-optimal sample
complexity results (upto logarithmic factors) for tensor recovery. Our method
is based on reduction to matrix completion sub-problems and adaptation of
Leurgans' method for tensor decomposition. We extend the methodology and sample
complexity results to higher order tensors, and experimentally validate our
theoretical results.

shown in 2D flow simulations that, to obtain reliable wave damping, the

A scaling law for selecting these damping coefficients is presented, which
enables similarity of the damping in model- and full-scale. The influence of
the thickness of the damping layer, the wave steepness, the mesh fineness and
the choice of the damping coefficients are examined. An efficient approach for
estimating the optimal damping setup is presented. Results of 3D ship
resistance computations show that the scaling laws apply to such simulations as
well, so the damping coefficients should be adjusted for every simulation to
ensure convergence of the solution in both model and full scale. Finally,
practical recommendations for the setup of reliable damping in flow simulations

Az = 90-130 degree, a previously unexplored region. We derive the plasma
electron temperatures using the line-to-continuum ratios and use them as
proxies for the nebular [O/H] abundances, because in thermal equilibrium the
abundance of the coolants (O, N, and other heavy elements) in the ionized gas
sets the electron temperature, with high abundances producing low temperatures.
Combining these data with our previous work produces a sample of 90 HII regions
with high quality electron temperature determinations. We derive kinematic
distances in a self-consistent way for the entire sample. The radial gradient
in [O/H] is -0.082 +/- 0.014 dex/kpc for Az = 90-130 degree, about a factor of
two higher than the average value between Az = 0-60 degree. Monte Carlo
simulations show that the azimuthal structure we reported for Az = 0-60 degree
is not significant because kinematic distance uncertainties can be as high as
50% in this region. Nonetheless, the flatter radial gradients between Az = 0-60
degree compared with Az = 90-130 degree, are significant within the
uncertainty. We suggest that this may be due to radial mixing from the Galactic

This distribution is composite and is based on the well known $\kappa-\mu$

the derived model constitutes the $\kappa-\mu$ Extreme/gamma model which
accounts for severe multipath and shadowing effects. These models provide
accurate characterisation of the simultaneous occurrence of multipath fading
and shadowing effects. This is achieved thanks to the remarkable flexibility of
their named parameters which render them capable of providing good fittings to
experimental data associated with realistic communication scenarios. This is
additionally justified by the fact that they include as special cases the
widely known composite fading models such as Rice/gamma, Nakagami-m/gamma and
Rayleigh/gamma. Novel analytic expressions are derived for the envelope and
power probability density function of these distributions which are expressed
in a relatively simple algebraic form which is convenient to handle both

acceptable approximation of real chemical reaction processes. Analyzing the
derivation of this equation yields the fact that its good performance of
approximating real reaction processes is due to Michaelis-Menten curve (15).
This curve is derived from Quasi-Steady-State Assumption(QSSA), which has been
proved always true and called Quasi-Steady-State Law by Banghe Li et al [19].
  Here, we found a quartic equation A(S,E)=0 (22), which gives more accurate
approximation of the reaction process in two aspects: during the quasi-steady
state of a reaction, Michaelis-Menten curve approximates the reaction well,
while our quartic equation $A(S,E)=0$ gives better approximation; near the end
of the reaction, our equation approaches the end of the reaction with a tangent
line same to that of the reaction, while Michaelis-Menten curve does not. In
addition, our quartic equation A(S,E)=0 differs to Michaelis-Menten curve less
than the order of $1/S^3$ as S approaches $+\infty$.

of Michaelis-Menten curve. Intuitively, this new equation is more complex and
harder to understand. But, just because its complexity, it provides more
information about the rate constants than Michaelis-Menten curve does.
  Finally, we get a better replacement of the Michaelis-Menten equation by
combing A(S,E)=0 and the equation $dP/dt=k_2C(t)$.

  publication",,,,"cs.GT math.CO q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent and ongoing work, Baldwin and Klemperer explored a connection
between tropical geometry and economics. They gave a sufficient condition for
the existence of competitive equilibrium in product-mix auctions of indivisible
goods. This result, which we call the Unimodularity Theorem, can also be traced
back to the work of Danilov, Koshevoy, and Murota in discrete convex analysis.
We give a new proof of the Unimodularity Theorem via the classical
unimodularity theorem in integer programming. We give a unified treatment of
these results via tropical geometry and formulate a new sufficient condition
for competitive equilibrium when there are only two types of product.
Generalizations of our theorem in higher dimensions are equivalent to various
forms of the Oda conjecture in algebraic geometry.

to ordinary differential equations by means of similarity transformation. These

Method (OHAM) which provides us with a convenient way to control the
convergence of approximation solutions and adjust convergence rigorous when

variables is a well known and studied concept. In the case of quaternion random
variables, some extensions have been proposed, leading to applications in
quaternion signal processing (detection, filtering, estimation). Just like in
the complex case, circularity for a quaternion-valued random variable is
related to the symmetries of its probability density function. As a
consequence, properness of quaternion random variables should be defined with
respect to the most general isometries in $4D$, i.e. rotations from $SO(4)$.
Based on this idea, we propose a new definition of properness, namely the
$(\mu_1,\mu_2)$-properness, for quaternion random variables using invariance
property under the action of the rotation group $SO(4)$. This new definition
generalizes previously introduced properness concepts for quaternion random
variables. A second order study is conducted and symmetry properties of the
covariance matrix of $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$-proper quaternion random variables are
presented. Comparisons with previous definitions are given and simulations
illustrate in a geometric manner the newly introduced concept.

Perovskite based solar cells promise high efficiencies at low cost. One expects
that a tandem cell design with these cells connected in series will improve the
efficiency further. Using a self-consistent numerical modeling of optical and
transport characteristics, however, we find that a traditional series connected
tandem design suffers from low Jsc due to band-gap mismatch and current
matching constraints. It requires careful thickness optimization of Perovskite
to achieve any noticeable efficiency gain. Specifically, a traditional tandem
cell with state-of-the-art HIT (24%) and Perovskite (20%) sub-cells provides
only a modest tandem efficiency of ~25%. Instead, we demonstrate that a
bifacial HIT/Perovskite tandem design decouples the optoelectronic constraints
and provides an innovative path for extraordinary efficiencies. In the bifacial
configuration, the same state-of the-art sub-cells achieve a normalized output
of 33%, exceeding the bifacial HIT performance at practical albedo reflections.
Unlike the traditional design, this bifacial design is relatively insensitive
to Perovskite thickness variations, which may translate to simpler manufacture
and higher yield.

stocks. Treating a stock market as a self-organized system governed by a fast
purchase process and slow variations of demand and supply the model suggests
that the short term price distribution has the form a logistic (Laplace)
distribution. The long term return can be described by Laplace-Gaussian mixture
distributions. The long term mean price evolution is governed by a Walrus
equation, which can be transformed into a replicator equation. This allows
quantifying the evolutionary price competition between stocks. The theory
suggests that stock prices scaled by the price over all stocks can be used to
investigate long-term trends in a Fisher-Pry plot. The price competition that
follows from the model is illustrated by examining the empirical long-term
price trends of two stocks.
