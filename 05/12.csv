cellular responses, such as cell motility and division. Spatio-temporal
quantification of these concentrations as produced by cells has proven
challenging. As a result, artificial gradients must be introduced to the cell
culture to correlate signal and response. Here we demonstrate a label-free
nanoplasmonic imaging technique that can directly map protein concentrations as
secreted by single cells in real time and which integrates with standard
live-cell microscopes. When used to measure the secretion of antibodies from
hybridoma cells, a broad range of time-dependent concentrations was observed:
from steady-state secretions of 230 pM near the cell surface to large
transients which reached as high as 56 nM over several minutes and then
dissipated. The label-free nature of the technique is minimally invasive and we
anticipate will enable the quantification of deterministic relationships
between secreted protein concentrations and their induced cellular responses.

passive scalars in isotropic compressible turbulence. In the inertial range,
the kinetic energy and scalar have the Kolmogorov spectra, and the Kolmogorov
and Obukhov-Corrsin constants are 2.06 and 0.87, respectively. The local
scaling exponents computed from the second-order structure functions exist
plateaus for velocity and active scalar, while that for passive scalar takes
first a minimum of 0.61 then a maximum of 0.73. The mixed third-order structure
function of velocity and passive scalar satisfies the 4/3-law. For the scaling
exponent, the one of velocity and passive scalar mixing is between those of
velocity and passive scalar, while the one of velocity and active scalar mixing
is below those of velocity and active scalar. At large amplitudes, the p.d.f.
of active scalar fluctuations is super-Gaussian, whereas that of passive scalar
fluctuations is sub-Gaussian. Moreover, the p.d.f.s of the two scalar
increments are concave and convex shapes, respectively, which exhibit strong
intermittency at small scales, and approach Gaussian as scale increases. The
active scalar has ""ramp-cliff"" structures, while the passive scalar seems to be
dominated by rarefaction and compression. By employing a ""coarse-graining""
approach, we study scalar cascades. Unlike passive scalar, the cascade of
active scalar is mainly determined by the viscous dissipation at small scales
and the pressure-dilatation at large scales, where the latter is substantial in
the vicinity of small-scale shocklets but is negligible after space averages,
because of the cancelations between rarefaction and compression regions.
Finally, in the inertial range, the p.d.f.s for the subgrid-scale fluxes of
scalars can collapse to the same distribution, revealing the scale-invariant
feature for the statistics of active and passive scalars.

brief review of experimental observations that pose a challenge to the theory,
we concentrate on a commonly studied model which describes the interaction of
the charge carriers with inter-molecular vibrations. We present different
theoretical approaches that have been applied to the problem in the past, and
then turn to more modern approaches that are able to capture the key
microscopic phenomenon at the origin of the puzzling experimental observations,
i.e. the quantum localization of the electronic wavefuntion at timescales
shorter than the typical molecular motions. We describe in particular a
relaxation time approximation which clarifies how the transient localization
due to dynamical molecular motions relates to the Anderson localization
realized for static disorder, and allows us to devise strategies to improve the
mobility of actual compounds. The relevance of the transient localization

demonstrated to provide attractive properties for certain classes of problems.
The proposed approach, Refined Stratified Sampling (RSS), capitalizes on these
properties through an adaptive process that adds samples sequentially by
dividing the existing subspaces of a stratified design. RSS is proven to reduce
variance compared to traditional stratified sample extension methods while
providing comparable or enhanced variance reduction when compared to sample
size extension methods for LHS - which do not afford the same degree of
flexibility to facilitate a truly adaptive UQ process. An initial investigation
of optimal stratification is presented and motivates the potential for major
advances in variance reduction through optimally designed RSS. Potential paths

a feedback strategy, but the error signal needed is tipically available only
when the cavity is near the resonance with a precision of the order $\Delta

interesting physical properties. Specifically the energy density behaves in one
of the following ways. (i) It is positive and constant for all time. (ii) It
varies with time and attains a global maximum after some time and then
asymptotically converges to zero. (iii) It increases for all time and attains a
maximum value at the asymptotic limit $t\rightarrow \infty$. In particular a
non-flat spacetime is obtained that mimics the expansion in a flat FRW universe
dominated by vacuum energy such that the expansion factor has the same form in
both. However, the energy density is dynamical in the former.

However, there is a clear trade off between the size of a particle to be
trapped, its spatial confinement, and the intensities required. This is due to
the decrease in optical response of smaller particles and the diffraction limit
that governs the spatial variation of optical fields. It is thus highly
desirable to find techniques that surpass these bounds. Recently, a number of
experiments using nanophotonic cavities have observed a qualitatively different
trapping mechanism described as ""self-induced back-action trapping"" (SIBA). In
these systems, the particle motion couples to the resonance frequency of the
cavity, which results in a strong interplay between the intra-cavity field
intensity and the forces exerted. Here, we provide a theoretical description
that for the first time captures the remarkable range of consequences. In
particular, we show that SIBA can be exploited to yield dynamic reshaping of
trap potentials, strongly sub-wavelength trap features, and significant
reduction of intensities seen by the particle, which should have important
implications for future trapping technologies

1915+105, GRO J1655-40, and XTE J1550-564 have been carried out based on
spectral and timing X-ray measurements and various theoretical concepts. Among
others, a non-linear resonance between axisymmetric epicyclic oscillation modes
of an accretion disc around a Kerr black hole has been considered as a model
for the observed high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs).
Estimates of spin predicted by this model have been derived based on the
geodesic approximation of the accreted fluid motion. Here we assume accretion
flow described by the model of a pressure-supported torus and carry out related
corrections to the mass-spin estimates. We find that for dimensionless black
hole spin a<0.9, the resonant eigenfrequencies are very close to those
calculated for the geodesic motion. Their values slightly grow with increasing
torus thickness. These findings agree well with results of a previous study
carried out in the pseudo-Newtonian approximation. The situation becomes
different for a>0.9, in which case the resonant eigenfrequencies rapidly
decrease as the torus thickness increases. We conclude that the assumed
non-geodesic effects shift the lower limit of the spin, implied for the three
microquasars by the epicyclic model and independently measured masses, from
a~0.7 to a~0.6. Their consideration furthermore confirms compatibility of the
model with the rapid spin of GRS 1915+105 and provides highly testable
predictions of the QPO frequencies. Individual sources with a moderate spin
(a<0.9) should exhibit a smaller spread of the measured 3:2 QPO frequencies
than sources with a near-extreme spin (a~1). This should be further examined
using the large amount of high-resolution data expected to become available
with the next generation of X-ray instruments, such as the proposed Large
Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT).

to understand. Recently, microlensing observations have constrained the size of
the quasar X-ray emission region to be of the order of 10 gravitational radii
of the central supermassive black hole. For distances within a few
gravitational radii, light paths are strongly bent by the strong gravity field
of the central black hole. If the central black hole has nonzero angular
momentum (spin), a photon's polarization plane will be rotated by the
gravitational Faraday effect. The observed X-ray flux and polarization will
then be influenced significantly by the strong gravity field near the source.
Consequently, linear gravitational lensing theory is inadequate for such
extreme circumstances. We present simple algorithms computing strong lensing
effects of Kerr black holes, including effects on polarization. Our algorithms
are realized in a program ""KERTAP"" in two versions: MATLAB and Python. The key
ingredients of KERTAP are: a graphic user interface, a {\it backward}
ray-tracing algorithm, a polarization propagator dealing with gravitational
Faraday rotation, and algorithms computing observables such as flux
magnification and polarization angles. Our algorithms can be easily realized in
other programming languages such as FORTRAN, C, and C++. The MATLAB version of
KERTAP is parallelized using the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox and the
Distributed Computing Server. The Python code was sped up using Cython and
supports full implementation of MPI using 'mpi4py' package. As an example, we
investigate the inclination angle dependence of the observed polarization and
the strong lensing magnification of AGN X-ray emission. We conclude that it is
possible to perform complex numerical-relativity-related computations using
interpreted languages such as MATLAB and Python.

binary or multiple systems in close orbits. By combining several telescopes
together and spectrally dispersing the light, it is possible to detect faint
components around bright stars. Aims. We provide a rigorous and detailed method
to search for high-contrast companions around stars, determine the detection
level, and estimate the dynamic range from interferometric observations. We
developed the code CANDID (Companion Analysis and Non-Detection in
Interferometric Data), a set of Python tools that allows us to search
systematically for point-source, high-contrast companions and estimate the
detection limit. The search pro- cedure is made on a N x N grid of fit, whose
minimum needed resolution is estimated a posteriori. It includes a tool to
estimate the detection level of the companion in the number of sigmas. The code
CANDID also incorporates a robust method to set a 3{\sigma} detection limit on
the flux ratio, which is based on an analytical injection of a fake companion
at each point in the grid. We used CANDID to search for the companions around
the binary Cepheids V1334 Cyg, AX Cir, RT Aur, AW Per, SU Cas, and T Vul.
First, we showed that our previous discoveries of the components orbiting V1334
Cyg and AX Cir were detected at > 13 sigmas. The companion around AW Per is
detected at more than 15 sigmas with a flux ratio of f = 1.22 +/- 0.30 %. We
made a possible detection of the companion orbiting RT Aur with f = 0.22 +/-
0.11 %. It was detected at 3.8{\sigma} using the closure phases only, and so
more observations are needed to confirm the detection. We also set the
detection limit for possible undetected companions. We found that there is no
companion with a spectral type earlier than B7V, A5V, F0V, B9V, A0V, and B9V
orbiting V1334 Cyg, AX Cir, RT Aur, AW Per, SU Cas, and T Vul, respectively.

that a single source dominates the CR flux in the corresponding energy range. A

they exist, the Chern scalar curvature would have the same geometric meaning as
the Riemannian scalar curvature. Recently, Liu-Yang showed that if this
equivalence of scalar curvatures holds even in average over a compact Hermitian
manifold, then the metric must in fact be Kahler. However, we prove that a
certain class of noncompact complex manifolds do admit Hermitian metrics for
which this equivalence holds. Subsequently, the question of to what extent the

conventional mirror and a metasurface, composed of a periodic lattice of metal
scatterers with a resonant response. This geometry has been used previously for
perfect absorption, in so-called Salisbury screens, and for hybridization of
localized plasmons with Fabry-Perot resonances. The particular aspect we
address is if one can assume an environment-independent reflectivity for the
metasurface when calculating the reflectivity of the composite system, as in a
standard Fabry-Perot analysis, or whether the fact that the metasurface
interacts with its own mirror image renormalizes its response. Using lattice
sum theory, we take into account all possible retarded dipole-dipole
interactions of scatterers in the metasurface amongst each other, and through
the mirror. We show that while a layer-by-layer Fabry-Perot formalism captures
the main qualitative features of metasurface etalons, in fact the mirror
modifies both the polarizability and reflectivity of the metasurface in a
fashion that is akin to Drexhage's modification of the radiative properties of
a single dipole.

(workers). Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning, which may result in
expensive query evaluation, while others apply heuristics aiming at minimizing
inter-node communication during query evaluation. This requires an expensive
data preprocessing phase, leading to high startup costs for very large RDF
knowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the query workload has also been used to
create partitions, which however are static and do not adapt to workload
changes; hence, inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided for
queries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning.
  In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system, which addresses
the shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash applies lightweight
partitioning on the initial data, that distributes triples by hashing on their
subjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time, the
locality-aware query optimizer of AdHash takes full advantage of the
partitioning to (i)support the fully parallel processing of join patterns on
subjects and (ii) minimize data communication for general queries by applying
hash distribution of intermediate results instead of broadcasting, wherever
possible. Second, AdHash monitors the data access patterns and dynamically
redistributes and replicates the instances of the most frequent ones among
workers. As a result, the communication cost for future queries is drastically
reduced or even eliminated. To control replication, AdHash implements an
eviction policy for the redistributed patterns. Our experiments with synthetic
and real data verify that AdHash (i) starts faster than all existing systems,
(ii) processes thousands of queries before other systems become online, and
(iii) gracefully adapts to the query load, being able to evaluate queries on
billion-scale RDF data in sub-seconds.

done without explicitly solving any blur estimation and subsequent inverse

magnitude. The method can be seen as a generalization of the align and average

theoretically supported, taking place in the Fourier domain. The method's
rationale is that camera shake has a random nature and therefore each image in
the burst is generally blurred differently. Experiments with real camera data,

demonstrate that in the presence of this term the vortex loop excitations of

term, the fermions should have massive Dirac spectrum coupled to the emergent
spin field of the spin sector. The Dirac spectrum can be realized by a planar

spectrum from the lobe was reproduced by a power-low model with a photon index
of $\Gamma = 2.23_{-0.38-0.12}^{+0.44+0.14}$ where the first and second errors
represent the statistical and systematic ones, respectively. Within the errors,
the X-ray index was consistent with the radio synchrotron one, $\Gamma_{\rm R}

supports that the X-ray emission is attributed to the inverse-Compton (IC)

microwave background photons are up-scattered. This result made 3C 236 the
largest radio galaxy, of which the lobe has ever been probed through the IC
X-ray photons. When the photon index was fixed at $\Gamma_{\rm R}$, the X-ray

comparison of the X-ray flux to the radio one ($S_{\rm R} = 1.11 \pm 0.02$ Jy

magnetic field strength of $B = 0.48_{-0.04 -0.10}^{+0.05 +0.12}$ $\mu$G.These

the reference SAM in order to have it run self-consistently and calibrated on

mass temperature relation and of the baryon fraction in DM haloes, due to the
different virial scalings and to the gravitational bias, respectively. Our
results show that the predictions of our coupled-DE SAM do not differ
significantly from theoretical predictions obtained with standard SAMs applied
to a reference $\Lambda$CDM simulation, implying that the statistical
properties of galaxies provide only a weak probe for these alternative
cosmological models. On the other hand, we show that both galaxy bias and the
galaxy pairwise velocity distribution are sensitive to coupled DE models: this
implies that these probes might be successfully applied to disentangle among

inevitably induced by the product of the first-order scalar modes. We study the
effect of the second-order vector mode on the weak lensing curl- and B-modes.
We find that the curl-mode induced by the second-order vector mode is
comparable to that induced by the primordial gravitational waves with the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 0.1$ at $\ell \approx 200$. In this case, the
curl-mode induced by the second-order vector mode dominates at $\ell > 200$.
Furthermore, the B-mode cosmic shear induced by the second-order vector mode

lengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for a
typical distance of 100 pc). These filaments show a preferred orientation
parallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derived
from their polarization angles. We present mean maps of the filaments in Stokes
I, Q, U, E, and B, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align the
orientations of the filaments. Combining the stacked images and the histogram
of relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of the
filaments to be 11 %. Furthermore, we show that the correlation between the
filaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the E and B

Sitter vacuum phase. Such models are said to be faced with a ""Boltzmann Brain
problem"" - the overwhelming majority of observers with fixed local conditions
are random fluctuations in the de Sitter vacuum, rather than arising via
thermodynamically sensible evolution from a low-entropy past. We argue that
this worry can be straightforwardly avoided in the Many-Worlds (Everett)
approach to quantum mechanics, as long as the underlying Hilbert space is
infinite-dimensional. In that case, de Sitter settles into a truly stationary
quantum vacuum state. While there would be a nonzero probability for observing
Boltzmann-Brain-like fluctuations in such a state, ""observation"" refers to a
specific kind of dynamical process that does not occur in the vacuum (which is,
after all, time-independent). Observers are necessarily out-of-equilibrium
physical systems, which are absent in the vacuum. Hence, the fact that
projection operators corresponding to states with observers in them do not
annihilate the vacuum does not imply that such observers actually come into
existence. The Boltzmann Brain problem is therefore much less generic than has
been supposed.

the underlying dark matter halos provides the crucial link from theories of
large-scale structure formation to interpreting the complex phenomena of galaxy
formation and evolution. We develop a novel statistical method, based on the
Halo Occupation Distribution model (HOD), to solve for this mapping by jointly
fitting the galaxy clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing measured from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The method, called the iHOD model, extracts
maximum information from the survey by including ~80% more galaxies than the
traditional HOD methods, and takes into account the incompleteness of the
stellar mass samples in a statistically consistent manner. The derived
stellar-to-halo mass relation not only explains the clustering and lensing of
SDSS galaxies over almost four decades in stellar mass, but also successfully
predicts the stellar mass functions observed in SDSS. Due to its capability of
modelling significantly more galaxies, the iHOD is able to break the degeneracy
between the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the
slope of the stellar-to-halo mass relation at high mass end, without the need
to assume a strong prior on the scatter and/or use the stellar mass function as
an input. We detect a decline of the scatter with halo mass, from 0.22 dex at
below 10^{12} Msun to 0.18 dex at 10^{14} Msun. The model also enables
stringent constraints on the satellite stellar mass functions at fixed halo
mass, predicting a departure from the Schechter functional form in high mass
halos. The iHOD model can be easily applied to existing and future
spectroscopic datasets, greatly improving the statistical constraint on the
stellar-to-halo mass relation compared to the traditional HOD methods within
the same survey.

(re)accelerate relativistic electrons. It is widely believed that the
acceleration proceeds via diffusive shock acceleration. In the framework of
thermal leakage, the ratio of the energy in relativistic electrons to the
energy in relativistic protons should should be smaller than $K_{\rm e/p} \sim
10^{-2}$. The relativistic protons interact with the thermal gas to produce
$\gamma$-rays in hadronic interactions. Combining observations of radio relics
with upper limits from $\gamma$-ray observatories can constrain the ratio
$K_{\rm e/p}$. In this work we selected 10 galaxy clusters that contain double
radio relics, and derive new upper limits from the stacking of $\gamma$-ray
observations by FERMI. We modelled the propagation of shocks using a
semi-analytical model, where we assumed a simple geometry for shocks and that
cosmic ray protons are trapped in the intracluster medium. Our analysis shows
that diffusive shock acceleration has difficulties in matching simultaneously
the observed radio emission and the constraints imposed by FERMI, unless the
magnetic field in relics is unrealistically large ($\gg 10 ~\rm \mu G$). In all
investigated cases (also including realistic variations of our basic model and
the effect of re-acceleration) the mean emission of the sample is of the order
of the stacking limit by FERMI, or larger. These findings put tension on the
commonly adopted model for the powering of radio relics, and imply that the
relative acceleration efficiency of electrons and protons is at odds with
predictions of diffusive shock acceleration, requiring $K_{\rm e/p} \geq
10-10^{-2}$.

for hydrodynamics: the 'meshless finite mass' (MFM) and 'meshless finite

hydrodynamics (SPH) and adaptive mesh-refinement (AMR) schemes. Here, we extend
these to include ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are
second-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a
divergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains div*B~0 to high accuracy. We
implement these in the code GIZMO, together with a state-of-the-art
implementation of SPH MHD. In every one of a large suite of test problems, the
new methods are competitive with moving-mesh and AMR schemes using constrained
transport (CT) to ensure div*B=0. They are able to correctly capture the growth
and structure of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), MHD turbulence, and
the launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than AMR
codes. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit proper convergence at fixed
neighbor number, sharper shock capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, div*B
errors, and diffusion. Still, 'modern' SPH is able to handle most of our tests,
at the cost of much larger kernels and 'by hand' adjustment of artificial
diffusion parameters. Compared to AMR, the new meshless methods exhibit
enhanced 'grid noise' but reduced advection errors and numerical diffusion,
velocity-independent errors, and superior angular momentum conservation and
coupling to N-body gravity solvers. As a result they converge more slowly on
some problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly on
others (involving advection or rotation). In all cases, divergence-control
beyond the popular Powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or else all methods we
consider will systematically converge to unphysical solutions.

loss. From these calculations, we investigate how the observed masses and radii
of exoplanets today relate to the distribution of their initial conditions.
Orbital distance and initial envelope mass fraction are the most important
factors determining planetary evolution, particular radius evolution. Initial
mass also becomes important below a ""turnoff mass,"" which varies with orbital
distance, with mass-radius curves being approximately flat for higher masses.
Initial radius is the least important parameter we study, with very little
difference between the hot start and cold start limits after an age of 100 Myr.
Model sets with no mass loss fail to produce results consistent with
observations, but a plausible range of mass loss scenarios is allowed. In
addition, we present scenarios for the formation of the Kepler-11 planets. Our

study the angular correlation function (ACF) of narrow-band selected,
$z\approx7$ Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs). The clustering of LAEs is
determined by both: (i) their typical host halo masses, $\bar{M}_{\rm h}$; and
(ii) the absorption due to a patchy EoR, characterized by an average neutral
fraction of the intergalactic medium, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$. We bracket the
allowed LAE ACFs by exploring extreme scenarios for both the intrinsic
Ly$\alpha$ emission and the large-scale pattern (i.e. morphology) of cosmic
ionized patches in physical EoR models. Independent of the EoR morphology,
current $z\approx 7$ ACF measurements constrain $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}\lesssim 0.5$

imply that LAEs are hosted by relatively small dark matter halos: $\bar{M}_{\rm

few per cent. These values are over an order of magnitude lower than the
analogous ones for color-selected, Lyman break galaxies, suggesting that

resonant scattering feature (CRSF) around 30 keV. A simple absorption-like line
with a Gaussian optical depth or a pseudo-Lorentzian profile both fail to
describe the shape of the CRSF accurately, leaving significant deviations at
the red side of the line. We characterize this asymmetry with a second
absorption feature around 19 keV. The line energy of the CRSF, which is not

positive luminosity dependence. With luminosities between (1-6)e36 erg/s, Cep

calibrate the period-luminosity relations and for populations studies in the
Galactic disc. Type II Cepheids are, however, very diverse, and classifications
based either on intrinsic (period, light curve) or external parameters (e.g.,
[Fe/H], |z|) do not provide a unique classification. We want to ascertain the
classification of two Cepheids, HQ Car and DD Vel, that are sometimes
classified as classical Cepheids and sometimes as Type II Cepheids. To achieve
this goal, we examine both their chemical composition and the presence of
specific features in their spectra. We find emission features in the H{\alpha}
and in the 5875.64 {\AA} He I lines that are typical of W Vir stars. The
[Na/Fe] (or [Na/Zn]) abundances are typical of thick-disc stars, while BL Her
stars are Na-overabundant ([Na/Fe]>+0.5 dex). Finally, the two Cepheids show a
possible (HQ Car) or probable (DD Vel) signature of mild dust-gas separation
that is usually observed only in long-period type II Cepheids and RV Tau stars.
These findings clearly indicate that HQ Car and DD Vel are both Type II
Cepheids from the W Vir sub-class. Several studies have reported an increase in
the Cepheids' abundance dispersion towards the outer (thin) disc. A detailed
inspection of the Cepheid classification, in particular for those located in
the outer disc, will indicate whether this feature is real or simply an
artefact of the inclusion of type II Cepheids belonging to the thick disc in
the current samples.

science. The combination of these ideas makes the security proofs of quantum
cryptography a complicated task. To prove that a quantum-cryptography protocol
is secure, assumptions are made about the protocol and its devices. If these
assumptions are not justified in an implementation then an eavesdropper may
break the security of the protocol. Therefore, security is crucially dependent
on which assumptions are made and how justified the assumptions are in an
implementation of the protocol.
  This thesis is primarily a review that analyzes and clarifies the connection
between the security proofs of quantum-cryptography protocols and their
experimental implementations. In particular, we focus on quantum key
distribution: the task of distributing a secret random key between two parties.
We provide a comprehensive introduction to several concepts: quantum mechanics
using the density operator formalism, quantum cryptography, and quantum key
distribution. We define security for quantum key distribution and outline
several mathematical techniques that can either be used to prove security or
simplify security proofs. In addition, we analyze the assumptions made in
quantum cryptography and how they may or may not be justified in
implementations.
  Along with the review, we propose a framework that decomposes
quantum-key-distribution protocols and their assumptions into several classes.
Protocol classes can be used to clarify which proof techniques apply to which
kinds of protocols. Assumption classes can be used to specify which assumptions
are justified in implementations and which could be exploited by an
eavesdropper. Two contributions of the author are discussed: the security
proofs of two two-way quantum-key-distribution protocols and an intuitive proof
of the data-processing inequality.

these constraints are avoided if sterile neutrinos couple to a new MeV-scale
gauge boson A'. However, even this scenario is restricted by structure
formation constraints when A'-mediated collisional processes lead to efficient
active-to-sterile neutrino conversion after neutrinos have decoupled. In view
of this, we reevaluate in this paper the viability of sterile neutrinos with
such ""secret"" interactions. We carefully dissect their evolution in the early
Universe, including the various production channels and the expected
modifications to large scale structure formation. We argue that there are two
regions in parameter space - one at very small A' coupling, one at relatively
large A' coupling - where all constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN),
cosmic microwave background (CMB), and large scale structure (LSS) data are
satisfied. Interestingly, the large A' coupling region is precisely the region
that was previously shown to have potentially important consequences for the
small scale structure of dark matter halos if the A' boson couples also to the
dark matter in the Universe.

metallicity profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies
are found in both the HI-rich and control samples. This contradicts a previous

effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some indication that barred
galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By applying a simple analytical
model we are able to account for the variety of metallicity profiles that the
two samples present. The success of this model implies that the metallicity in
these isolated galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star
formation. This insight could provide an explanation of the observed local

(SDSS) to create high signal-to-noise (>100) stacked spectra with minimal

stellar populations of barred and unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. By
splitting our sample by redshift, we can use the fixed size of the SDSS fiber
to model the stellar populations at different radii within galaxies. At
0.02<z<0.04, the SDSS fiber radius corresponds to ~1 kpc, which is the typical
half-light radii of both classical bulges and disky pseudobulges. Assuming that
the SDSS fiber primarily covers the bulges at these redshifts, our analysis
shows that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations,
i.e., stellar age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [N/Fe], of the bulges of barred vs.
unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. Modeling the stellar populations at different
redshift intervals from z=0.020 to z=0.085 at fixed stellar masses produces an
estimate of the stellar population gradients out to about half the typical
effective radius of our sample, assuming null evolution over this ~1 Gyr epoch.
We find that there are no noticeable differences in the slopes of the
azimuthally averaged gradients of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies.
These results suggest that bars are not a strong influence on the chemical

solution,
  (iii) optimal $L^2$-decay of mild solutions in all dimensions,

integral representation to obtain the quantitative decay rates of (ii).
  Next we use Fourier analysis techniques to obtain the optimal decay rate for
mild solutions. Here we encounter the critical dimension phenomenon where the
decay rate attains the decay rate of that in a bounded domain for large enough
dimensions. Consequently, the decay rate does not anymore improve when the
dimension increases. The theory is markedly different from that of the standard
caloric functions and this substantially complicates the analysis.
  Finally, we use energy estimates and a comparison principle to prove a
quantitative decay rate for weak solutions defined via a variational
formulation. Our main idea is to show that the $L^2$-norm is actually a
subsolution to a purely time-fractional problem which allows us to use the
known theory to obtain the result.

(IGC) paradigm have been introduced to explain energetic ($E_{\rm iso}\gtrsim
10^{52}$~erg), long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with type Ic supernovae
(SNe). The progenitor is a tight binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) core
and a neutron star (NS) companion, a subclass of the newly proposed
""ultra-stripped"" binaries. The CO-NS short-period orbit causes the NS to
accrete appriciable matter from the SN ejecta when the CO core collapses,
ultimately causing it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and producing a GRB.
These tight binaries evolve through the SN explosion very differently than
compact binaries studied in population synthesis calculations. First, the
hypercritical accretion onto the NS companion alters both the mass and momentum
of the binary. Second, because the explosion timescale is on par with the
orbital period, the mass ejection can not be assumed to be instantaneous. This
dramatically affects the post-SN fate of the binary. Finally, the bow shock
created as the accreting NS plows through the SN ejecta transfers angular
momentum, braking the orbit. These systems remain bound even if a large
fraction of the binary mass is lost in the explosion (well above the canonical
50\% limit), and even large kicks are unlikely to unbind the system. Indeed,
BdHNe produce a new family of NS-BH binaries unaccounted for in current
population synthesis analyses and, although they may be rare, the fact that
nearly 100\% remain bound implies they may play an important role in the
compact merger rate, important for gravitational waves (GWs) that, in turn, can
produce a new class of ultrashort GRBs.

static centrality was considered negligible, but whose temporal role is instead
important to accelerate mobilization flow in the network. We also observe the
reverse behaviour by detecting nodes with high static centrality, whose role as
temporal bridges is instead very low. By revealing important temporal roles,
this study is a first step towards a better understanding of the impact of time

massive gas giant exoplanets travel on highly elliptical orbits, whereas the
shape of the orbits of smaller, more terrestrial, exoplanets remained largely
elusive. Knowing the eccentricity distribution in systems of small planets
would be important as it holds information about the planet's formation and
evolution, and influences its habitability. We make these measurements using
photometry from the Kepler satellite and utilizing a method relying on Kepler's
second law, which relates the duration of a planetary transit to its orbital
eccentricity, if the stellar density is known. Our sample consists of 28 bright
stars with precise asteroseismic density measurements. These stars host 74
planets with an average radius of 2.6 $R_\oplus$. We find that the eccentricity
of planets in Kepler multi-planet systems is low and can be described by a
Rayleigh distribution with $\sigma$ = 0.049 $\pm$ 0.013. This is in full
agreement with solar system eccentricities, but in contrast to the eccentricity
distributions previously derived for exoplanets from radial velocity studies.
Our findings are helpful in identifying which planets are habitable because the
location of the habitable zone depends on eccentricity, and to determine
occurrence rates inferred for these planets because planets on circular orbits
are less likely to transit. For measuring eccentricity it is crucial to detect
and remove Transit Timing Variations (TTVs), and we present some previously
unreported TTVs. Finally transit durations help distinguish between false
positives and true planets and we use our measurements to confirm six new
exoplanets.

nonlinear instability is through the resonance with the wave continuum of a
multiple of an internal mode eigenfrequency in the linearization of excited
breather states. For the nonlinear instability, the internal mode must have its
Krein signature opposite to that of the wave continuum. This mechanism is not
only theoretically proposed, but also numerically corroborated through two
concrete examples of the Klein--Gordon lattice with a soft (Morse) and a hard
($\phi^4$) potential. Compared to the case of the nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger
lattice, the Krein signature of the internal mode relative to that of the wave
continuum may change depending on the period of the excited breather state. For
the periods for which the Krein signatures of the internal mode and the wave

to capture the complex interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter in
galaxy formation. Simulations with relatively low resolution now succeed in
describing the overall galaxy population. For example, the EAGLE simulation in
volumes up to 100 cubic Mpc reproduces the observed local galaxy mass function
nearly as well as semi-analytic models. It once seemed that galaxies are pretty
smooth, that they generally grow in size as they evolve, and that they are a
combination of disks and spheroids. But recent HST observations combined with
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations are showing that most star-forming
galaxies are very clumpy; that galaxies often undergo compaction which reduces
their radius and increases their central density; and that most lower-mass
star-forming galaxies are not spheroids or disks but are instead elongated when
their centers are dominated by dark matter. We also review LCDM challenges on
smaller scales: cusp-core, ""too big to fail,"" and substructure issues. Although
starbursts can rapidly drive gas out of galaxy centers and thereby reduce the
dark matter density, it remains to be seen whether this or other baryonic
physics can explain the observed rotation curves of the entire population of
dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. If not, perhaps more complicated
physics such as self-interacting dark matter may be needed. But standard LCDM

phenomenological growth functions for the magnetic field. With that we are able

different models for the dust yields of AGB stars. The DPRs of CE ejecta are
about $6.3\times10^{-6}$(The initial binary fraction is 50\%). These results
are within the large scatter of several observational estimates. AGB stars
mainly produce carbon grains, which is consistent with the observations. Most
of dust grains manufactured by CE ejecta are silicate and iron grains. The
contributions of SNe II are very uncertain. Compared with SNe II without
reverse shock, the DPRs of AGB stars and CE ejecta are negligible. However, if
only 2 \% of dust grains produced by SNe II can survive after reverse shock,
the contributions of SNe II are very small. The total dust masses produced by

without any underlying substrates into free-standing atomically-thin layers,
maintaining their planar 2D form. Using this property, we present a new
mechanism for 2D crystal synthesis, i.e. reagent-limited nucleation near an
aperture edge followed by reactions that allow crystal growth into the
free-space of the aperture. Such an approach enables us, for the first time,
the direct and selective growth of freestanding membranes of atomically thin
MoS2 layers across micrometer-scale pre-fabricated solid-state apertures in
SiNx membranes. Under optimal conditions, MoS2 grows preferentially across
apertures, resulting in sealed membranes that are one to a few atomic layers
thick. Since our method involves free-space growth and is devoid of either
substrates or transfer, it is conceivably the most contamination-free method
for obtaining 2D crystals reported so far. The membrane quality was
investigated using atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and low-noise ion-current
recordings through nanopores fabricated in such membranes.

the MAXIMA of the input is of small size $h$, and yields a solution running in

\emph{intersection graph} of the input has small treewidth $\omega$. It yields
an algorithm running in time within $O(n^4\omega \log \omega + n (\omega \log

consisting of a source node S, a destination node D, and an intermediate node
R. The intermediate node connects the source and the destination nodes via a
set of noiseless parallel channels, with sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively. A
message $M$ is to be sent from S to D. The information in the network may be
eavesdropped by a set of wiretappers. The wiretappers cannot communicate with
one another. Each wiretapper can access a subset of channels, called a wiretap
set. All the chosen wiretap sets form a wiretap pattern. A random key $K$ is
generated at S and a coding scheme on $(M, K)$ is employed to protect $M$. We
define two decoding classes at D: In Class-I, only $M$ is required to be
recovered and in Class-II, both $M$ and $K$ are required to be recovered. The
objective is to minimize $H(K)/H(M)$ {for a given wiretap pattern} under the
perfect secrecy constraint. The first question we address is whether routing is
optimal on this simple network. By enumerating all the wiretap patterns on the
Class-I/II $(3,3)$ networks and harnessing the power of Shannon-type
inequalities, we find that gaps exist between the bounds implied by routing and
the bounds implied by Shannon-type inequalities for a small fraction~($<2\%$)
of all the wiretap patterns. The second question we investigate is the
following: What is $\min H(K)/H(M)$ for the remaining wiretap patterns where
gaps exist? We study some simple wiretap patterns and find that their Shannon
bounds (i.e., the lower bound induced by Shannon-type inequalities) can be
achieved by linear codes, which means routing is not sufficient even for the
($3$, $3$) network. For some complicated wiretap patterns, we study the
structures of linear coding schemes under the assumption that they can achieve
the corresponding Shannon bounds....

Bayesian network which is a perfect map for the data generating distribution.

aims to shape probability density function of the stochastic states, while
satisfying input and joint state chance constraints. Closed-loop stability is
ensured by designing a stability constraint in terms of a stochastic control
Lyapunov function, which explicitly characterizes stability in a probabilistic
sense. The Fokker-Planck equation is used for describing the dynamic evolution

section of accretion disks. It is known that molecular viscosity is negligible
in accretion disks. Hence, it has been argued that a mechanism, known as
Magnetorotational Instability (MRI), is responsible for transporting matter in
the presence of weak magnetic field. However, there are some shortcomings,
which question effectiveness of MRI. Now the question arises, whether other
hydromagnetic effects, e.g. transient growth (TG), can play important role to
bring nonlinearity in the system, even at weak magnetic fields. Otherwise,
whether MRI or TG, which is primarily responsible to reveal nonlinearity to
make the flow turbulent? Our results prove explicitly that the flows with high
Reynolds number (Re), which is the case of realistic astrophysical accretion
disks, exhibit nonlinearity by TG of perturbation modes faster than that by
modes producing MRI. For a fixed wave vector, MRI dominates over transient
effects, only at low Re, lower than its value expected to be in astrophysical
accretion disks, and low magnetic fields. This seriously questions (overall)
persuasiveness of MRI in astrophysical accretion disks.

isolate the desired QCD eigenstate. For low-lying states, such techniques
facilitate the removal of excited state contributions. In principle the method
enables one to consider arbitrary eigenstates. We find our results are in
accord with the non-relativistic quark model for heavy masses. In moving
towards the light-quark regime we observe an interesting quark mass dependence,
contrary to the quark model expectation. Comparison of our light-quark result

incorporating exchangeable frailties in the linear predictor of commonly-used
survival models, we allow the frailty distribution to flexibly change with both
continuous and categorical cluster-level covariates and model them using a

easy to fit using an existing R package. The application of the model to our

increased hormone replacement therapy treatments prescribed to more urban and

of filaments. Filaments are often observed as extending in the direction
perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field. The structure of filaments
has been studied based on a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium model (Tomisaka
2014). Here, we simulate the expected polarization pattern for isothermal
magnetohydrostatic filaments. The filament exhibits a polarization pattern in
which the magnetic field is apparently perpendicular to the filament when
observed from the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. When the
line-of-sight is parallel to the global magnetic field, the observed
polarization pattern is dependent on the center-to-surface density ratio for
the filament and the concentration of the gas mass toward the central magnetic
flux tube. Filaments with low center-to-surface density ratios have an
insignificant degree of polarization when observed from the direction parallel
to the global magnetic field. However, models with a large center-to-surface
density ratio have polarization patterns that indicate the filament is
perpendicularly threaded by the magnetic field. When mass is heavily
concentrated at the central magnetic flux tube, which can be realized by the
ambipolar diffusion process, the polarization pattern is similar to that
expected for a low center-to-surface density contrast.

been studied in various scenarios and has been shown to be detrimental or
provide benefits depending on the particular system and underlying assumptions.
In this paper, we investigate the effect of transmit correlation on the
capacity of the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel (BC), with a particular
interest in the large-scale array (or massive MIMO) regime. To this end, we
introduce a new type of diversity, referred to as transmit correlation
diversity, which captures the fact that the channel vectors of different users
may have different, and often nearly mutually orthogonal, large-scale channel
eigen-directions. In particular, when taking the cost of downlink training
properly into account, transmit correlation diversity can yield significant
capacity gains in all regimes of interest. Our analysis shows that the system
multiplexing gain can be increased by a factor up to $\lfloor{M}/{r}\rfloor$,
where $M$ is the number of antennas and $r\le M$ is the common rank of the
users transmit correlation matrices, with respect to standard schemes that are
agnostic of the transmit correlation and treat the channels as if they were
isotropically distributed. Thus, this new form of diversity reveals itself as a
valuable ""new resource"" in multiuser communications.

also result in low spectrum utilization efficiency. Inter-operator spectrum
sharing is a potential method to enhance spectrum utilization. In order to
realize it, a protocol to coordinate the actions of operators is needed. We
propose a spectrum sharing protocol which is distributed in nature, it does not
require operator-specific information exchange and it incurs minimal
communication overhead between the operators. Operators are still free to
decide whether they share spectrum or not as the protocol is based on the book
keeping of spectrum usage favors, asked and received by the operators. We show
that operators can enhance their QoS in comparison with traditional orthogonal
spectrum allocation while also maintaining reciprocity i.e. no operator
benefits over the other in the long run. We demonstrate the usability of the
proposed protocol in an indoor deployment scenario with frequent network load
variations as expected to have in small cell deployments.

a gradient descent scheme on this Lie group. The parameter defining the family
is chosen to optimize the cutoff rate of the constellation. The optimal

constellation rotated by such a matrix lacks full diversity, in contrast with
the conventional wisdom that good signal sets exhibit full diversity. A new
notion of diversity, referred to as local diversity, is introduced to attempt
to account for this behavior. Roughly, a locally fully diverse constellation is
fully diverse only in small neighborhoods. A local variant of the minimum

branes play the role of half-BPS co-dimension-1 defects (domain walls) in 3d

the subject of boundary conditions in (supersymmetric) Chern-Simons theory, we
discuss in detail the field theory construction of a large class of

the continuum fracture energy deriving from a discrete-to-continuum analysis at

anisotropic Griffith energy. This bound is optimal if the macroscopic
displacement satisfies some opening-crack conditions on the fracture site. We
show that if such conditions are not satisfied then the computation of the

bypass the positive-determinant constraint on crack surfaces and at points
where more cracks meet. Even when the limit fracture energy may be described by
a surface energy density, this may depend on the crack orientation both in the

interesting analytical issues, they call into question the necessity of the

and large systems can be stable. In ecology, the so-called `diversity-stability
debate' arose because mathematical analyses of ecosystem stability were either
specific to a particular model (leading to results that were not general), or
chosen for mathematical convenience, yielding results unlikely to be meaningful
for any interesting realistic system. May's work, and its subsequent
elaborations, relied upon results from random matrix theory, particularly the
circular law and its extensions, which only apply when the strengths of
interactions between entities in the system are assumed to be independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.). Other studies have optimistically generalised
from the analysis of very specific systems, in a way that does not hold up to
closer scrutiny. We show here that this debate can be put to rest, once these
two contrasting views have been reconciled --- which is possible in the
statistical framework developed here. Here we use a range of illustrative
examples of dynamical systems to demonstrate that (i) stability probability
cannot be summarily deduced from any single property of the system (e.g. its
diversity), and (ii) our assessment of stability depends on adequately
capturing the details of the systems analysed. Failing to condition on the
structure of dynamical systems will skew our analysis and can, even for very
small systems, result in an unnecessarily pessimistic diagnosis of their
stability.

Ising model in the presence of a spatially homogeneous but periodically
time-varying transverse field of frequency $\omega_0$, we arrive at the
characteristic cumulant generating function $G(u)$, which is then used to
calculate the work distribution function $P(W)$. By applying the Floquet theory
we show that, in the infinite time limit, $P(W)$ converges, starting from the
initial ground state, towards an asymptotic steady state value whose small-$W$
behaviour depends only on the properties of the small-wave-vector modes and on
a few important ingredients: the time-averaged value of the transverse field,
$h_0$, the initial transverse field, $h_{\rm i}$, and the equilibrium quantum
critical point $h_c$, which we find to generate a sequence of non-equilibrium
critical points $h_{*l}=h_c+l\omega_0/2$, with $l$ integer. When $h_{\rm i}\neq
h_c$, we find a ""universal"" edge singularity in $P(W)$ at a threshold value of
$W_{\rm th}=2|h_{\rm i}-h_c|$ which is entirely determined by $h_{\rm i}$. The
form of that singularity --- Dirac delta derivative or square root --- depends
on $h_0$ being or not at a non-equilibrium critical point $h_{*l}$. On the
contrary, when $h_{\rm i}=h_c$, $G(u)$ decays as a power-law for large $u$,
leading to different types of edge singularity at $W_{\rm th}=0$. Generalizing
our calculations to the case in which we initialize the system in a finite
temperature density matrix, the irreversible entropy generated by the periodic
driving is also shown to reach a steady state value in the infinite time limit.

which results from a terminating veto that prevents the recombination of two

that the new approach works better than the corresponding generalized $k_T$ jet

discrete-time NB-PLC channels. As part of the capacity derivation, we
characterize the capacity achieving transmission scheme, which leads to a
practical code construction that approaches capacity. The capacity derived in
this work is numerically evaluated for several NB-PLC channel configurations
taken from previous works, and the results show that the optimal scheme
achieves a substantial rate gain over a previously proposed ad-hoc scheme. This
gain is due to optimally accounting for the periodic properties of the channel
and the noise.

matter that has been successful in fitting and predicting the rich
phenomenology of rotating disc galaxies. There have also been attempts to test
MOND in dispersion-supported early-type galaxies, but it remains unclear
whether MOND can fit the various empirical properties of early-type galaxies.
As a way of rigorously testing MOND in elliptical galaxies we calculate the
MOND-predicted velocity dispersion profiles (VDPs) in the inner regions of
$\sim 2000$ nearly round SDSS elliptical galaxies under a variety of
assumptions on VD anisotropy, and then compare the predicted distribution of
VDP slopes with the observed distribution in 11 ATLAS3d galaxies selected with
essentially the same criteria. We find that the MOND model parameterised with
an interpolating function that works well for rotating galaxies can also
reproduce the observed distribution of VDP slopes based only on the observed
stellar mass distribution without DM or any other galaxy-to-galaxy varying
factor. This is remarkable in view that Newtonian dynamics with DM requires a
specific amount and/or profile of DM for each galaxy in order to reproduce the
observed distribution of VDP slopes. When we analyse non-round galaxy samples
using the MOND-based spherical Jeans equation, we do not find any systematic
difference in the mean property of the VDP slope distribution compared with the
nearly round sample. However, in line with previous studies of MOND through
individual analyses of elliptical galaxies, varying MOND interpolating function
or VD anisotropy can lead to systematic change in the VDP slope distribution,
indicating that a statistical analysis of VDPs can be used to constrain
specific MOND models with an accurate measurement of VDP slopes or a prior
constraint on VD anisotropy.

excited when the spin-orbit resonances occur. The most notable resonances occur
when the $s_7$ and $s_8$ frequencies, changing as a result of planetary
migration, become commensurate with the precession frequencies of Jupiter's and
Saturn's spin vectors. We show that Jupiter may have obtained its present
obliquity by crossing of the $s_8$ resonance. This would set strict constrains
on the character of migration during the early stage. Additional effects on
Jupiter's obliquity are expected during the last gasp of migration when the
$s_7$ resonance was approached. The magnitude of these effects depends on the
precise value of the Jupiter's precession constant. Saturn's large obliquity
was likely excited by capture into the $s_8$ resonance. This probably happened
during the late stage of planetary migration when the evolution of the $s_8$
frequency was very slow, and the conditions for capture into the spin-orbit
resonance with $s_8$ were satisfied. However, whether or not Saturn is in the
spin-orbit resonance with $s_8$ at the present time is not clear, because the
existing observations of Saturn's spin precession and internal structure models

planetesimals in the Solar System. Asteroids are traditionally thought to form
in a bottom-up process by coagulation within a population of initially km-scale
planetesimals. However, new models challenge this idea by demonstrating that
asteroids of sizes from 100 to 1000 km can form directly from the gravitational
collapse of small particles which have organised themselves in dense filaments
and clusters in the turbulent gas. Particles concentrate passively between
eddies down to the smallest scales of the turbulent gas flow and inside
large-scale pressure bumps and vortices. The streaming instability causes
particles to take an active role in the concentration, by piling up in dense
filaments whose friction on the gas reduces the radial drift compared to that
of isolated particles. In this chapter we review new paradigms for asteroid
formation and compare critically against the observed properties of asteroids
as well as constraints from meteorites. Chondrules of typical sizes from 0.1 to
1 mm are ubiquitous in primitive meteorites and likely represent the primary
building blocks of asteroids. Chondrule-sized particles are nevertheless
tightly coupled to the gas via friction and are therefore hard to concentrate
in large amounts in the turbulent gas. We review recent progress on
understanding the incorporation of chondrules into the asteroids, including
layered accretion models where chondrules are accreted onto asteroids over
millions of years. We highlight in the end ten unsolved questions in asteroid
formation where we expect that progress will be made over the next decade.

which can account for about 40% of the total intensity. Meanwhile, a minor
destructive interference is found for the angle bending mode. The state to
state mapping between the Albrecht's theory and the perturbation theory allows
us to verify the accuracy of the widely employed perturbation method for the
dynamic/resonant Raman intensities. The model calculations rationalized from
water molecule with the bending mode show that the perturbation method is a
good approximation only when the absolute energy difference between the first
excited state and the incident light is more than five times of the vibrational

concurrency, where the developer of a module writes a set of contract terms

Few-layer BP, obtained from bulk BP by exfoliation, is an emerging candidate as
a channel material in post-silicon electronics. A deep understanding of its
physical properties and its full range of applications are still being
uncovered. In this paper, we present a theoretical and experimental
investigation of phonon properties in few-layer BP, focusing on the
low-frequency regime corresponding to interlayer vibrational modes. We show
that the interlayer breathing mode A3g shows a large redshift with increasing
thickness; the experimental and theoretical results agreeing well. This
thickness dependence is two times larger than that in the chalcogenide
materials such as few-layer MoS2 and WSe2, because of the significantly larger
interlayer force constant and smaller atomic mass in BP. The derived interlayer
out-of-plane force constant is about 50% larger than that in graphene and MoS2.
We show that this large interlayer force constant arises from the sizable
covalent interaction between phosphorus atoms in adjacent layers, and that
interlayer interactions are not merely of the weak van der Waals type. These
significant interlayer interactions are consistent with the known surface
reactivity of BP, and have been shown to be important for electric-field
induced formation of Dirac cones in thin film BP.

associated with lightning activity in thunderstorms. Using Monte Carlo
simulations of the relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) process,
theoretical predictions for the temporal and spectral evolution of TGFs are
compared to observations made with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Assuming a single source altitude of 15
km, a comparison of simulations to data is performed for a range of empirically
chosen source electron variation time scales. The data exhibit a clear
softening with increased source distance, in qualitative agreement with

that the basic RREA model is not sufficient. Alternatively, a TGF beam that is
tilted with respect to the zenith could produce an evolution with source
distance that is compatible with the data. Based on these results, we propose
that the source electron distributions of TGFs observed by GBM vary on time

are observed with 19 of TGFs having multiple pulses separated in time and 31
clear cases of partially overlapping pulses. The effect of instrumental dead
time and pulse pileup on the temporal properties are also presented. As the
observed gamma ray pulse structure is representative of the electron flux at
the source, TGF pulse parameters are critical to distinguish between
relativistic feedback discharge and lightning leader models. We show that at
least 67% of TGFs at satellite altitudes are significantly asymmetric. For the
asymmetric pulses, the rise times are almost always shorter than the fall
times. Those which are not are consistent with statistical fluctuations. The
median rise time for asymmetric pulses is ~3 times shorter than for symmetric
pulses while their fall times are comparable. The asymmetric shapes observed
are consistent with the relativistic feedback discharge model when Compton
scattering of photons between the source and Fermi is included, and
instrumental effects are taken into account.

one in the lattice Boltzmann method for simulating the convection heat transfer

instability at low fluid viscosities and effective thermal diffusivities. In
this paper, a modified LBGK model is developed for incompressible thermal flows
in porous media at the representative elementary volume scale, in which the
shear rate and temperature gradient are incorporated into the equilibrium
distribution functions. With two additional parameters, the relaxation times in
the collision process can be fixed at a proper value invariable to the
viscosity and the effective thermal diffusivity. In addition, by constructing a
modified equilibrium distribution function and a source term in the evolution
equation of temperature field, the present model can recover the macroscopic
equations correctly through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, which is another key
point different from previous LBGK models. Several benchmark problems are
simulated to validate the present model with the proposed local computing
scheme for the shear rate and temperature gradient, and the numerical results
agree well with analytical solutions and/or those well-documented data in
previous studies. It is also shown that the present model and the computational
schemes for the gradient operators have a second-order accuracy in space, and
better numerical stability of the present modified LBGK model than previous
LBGK models is demonstrated.

and infrared data. We confirm that the HI disc consists of two distinct
components: an inner star forming ring with radius from $\sim$ 1 to $\sim$ 3
R$_{eff}$, and an outer disc. The outer HI disc is 9 times more massive than
the inner HI ring. At the location of the inner HI ring we detect spiral-like
structure both in the deep $g'-r'$ image and in the 8 $\mu$m $Spitzer$-IRAC
image, extending in radius up to $\sim$ 3 R$_{eff}$. These two gas components
have a different star formation efficiency likely due to the different
metallicity and dust content. The inner component has a star formation
efficiency very similar to the inner regions of late-type galaxies. Although
the outer component has a very low star formation efficiency, it is similar to
that of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs. We suggest that these
differences can be explained with different gas origins for the two components
such as stellar mass loss for the inner HI ring and accretion from the inter
galactic medium (IGM) for the outer HI disc. The low level star formation
efficiency in the outer HI disc is not enough to change the morphology of NGC
4203, making the depletion time of the HI gas much too long.

expected rho length of a node of the functional graph of a polynomial over a
finite field. Since the distribution of indegrees (preimage sizes) of a class
of functions appears to play a central role in its average rho length, we
survey the known results for polynomials over finite fields giving new proofs
and improving one of the cases for quartic polynomials. We discuss the
effectiveness of the heuristic for many classes of polynomials by comparing our
experimental results with the known estimates for random mapping models defined
by different restrictions on their distribution of indegrees. We prove that the
distribution of indegrees of general polynomials and mappings have similar
asymptotic properties, including the same asymptotic average coalescence. The
combination of these results and our experiments suggests that these
polynomials behave like random mappings, extending a heuristic that was known
only for degree $2$. We show numerically that the behaviour of Chebyshev
polynomials of degree $d \geq 2$ over finite fields present a sharp contrast

the success probability of the algorithm is related to the closeness of the

provides a priori information which can be used to know the success probability
of the algorithm beforehand for the non-negative matrices and apply the
algorithm only in cases when the estimated probability reasonably high.

Einstein-scalar system with a potential, which admits at most two AdS critical
points and is expressed in terms of a real superpotential. Our solution is
static, admits maximally symmetric horizons, asymptotically tends to AdS space
corresponding to an extremum of the superpotential, but is disconnected from
the Schwarzschild-AdS family. The condition under which the spacetime admits an
event horizon is addressed for each horizon topology. It turns out that for
hyperbolic horizons the black holes can be extremal. In this case, the
near-horizon geometry is AdS_2 x H^2, where the scalar goes to the other,
non-supersymmetric, critical point of the potential. Our solution displays
fall-off behaviours different from the standard one, due to the fact that the
mass parameter $m^2=-2/\ell^2$ at the supersymmetric vacuum lies in a
characteristic range $m^2_{BF}\le m^2\le m^2_{\rm BF}+\ell^{-2}$ for which the
slowly decaying scalar field is also normalizable. Nevertheless, we identify a
well-defined mass for our spacetime, following the prescription of Hertog and
Maeda. Quite remarkably, the product of all horizon areas is not given in terms
of the asymptotic cosmological constant alone, as one would expect in absence
of electromagnetic charges and angular momentum. Our solution shows
qualitatively the same thermodynamic behaviour as the Schwarzschild-AdS black

in general? This dichotomy is a culmination of previous ones, including those
for Spin Systems, Holant, and #CSP. A recurring theme has been that a
holographic reduction to FKT is a universal strategy. Surprisingly, for planar
Holant, we discover new planar tractable problems that are not expressible by a
holographic reduction to FKT.
  In previous work, an important tool was a dichotomy for #CSP^d, which denotes
#CSP where every variable appears a multiple of d times. However its proof
violates planarity. We prove a dichotomy for planar #CSP^2. We apply this

matchings (#PM) over k-uniform hypergraphs is polynomial-time computable when
the incidence graph is planar and k >= 5. The same problem is #P-hard when k=3

2 and 4.6 have been found to occur in two modes, distinguished by the width of
their HeII emission lines. Broad HeII emission has been attributed to stellar
emission from a population of evolved Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars while narrow HeII
emission has been attributed to nebular emission excited by a population of
very hot PopIII stars formed in pockets of pristine gas at moderate redshifts.
In this work we propose an alternative scenario for the origin of the narrow
HeII emission, namely very massive stars (VMS) at low metallicity (Z) which
form strong but slow WR-type stellar winds due to their proximity to the
Eddington limit. We estimate the expected HeII line fluxes and equivalent
widths based on wind models for VMS and population synthesis models, and
compare the results with recent observations of star-forming galaxies at
moderate redshifts. The observed HeII line strengths and equivalent widths are
in line with what is expected for a population of VMS in one or more young
super-clusters located within these galaxies. In our scenario the two observed
modes of HeII emission originate from massive stellar populations in distinct
evolutionary stages at low Z. If this interpretation is correct there is no
need to postulate the existence of PopIII stars at moderate redshifts to
explain the observed narrow HeII emission. An interesting possibility is the
existence of self-enriched VMS with similar WR-type spectra at extremely low Z.
Stellar HeII emission from such very early generations of VMS may be detectable
in future studies of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts with the James
Webb Space Telescope. The fact that the HeII emission of VMS is largely
neglected in current population synthesis models will generally affect the
interpretation of the integrated spectra of young stellar populations.

prohibitively slow. Moreover, in several contemporary applications, the
population matrix is approximately sparse, and only its few large entries are
of interest. This raises the following question, at the focus of our work:
Assuming approximate sparsity of the covariance matrix, can its large entries
be detected much faster, say in sub-quadratic time, without explicitly
computing all its $p^{2}$ entries? In this paper, we present and theoretically
analyze two randomized algorithms that detect the large entries of an
approximately sparse sample covariance matrix using only $O(np\text{ poly log }

derive sufficient conditions on the underlying random variable and on the
number of samples $n$, for the sample covariance matrix to satisfy our
approximate sparsity requirements. Finally, we illustrate the performance of
our algorithms via several simulations.

find a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave solution in both electron- and hole-doped
cases. In the quasi-spin triplet channel, the longitudinal fluctuations give
rise to an effective attraction supporting a $p$-wave gap, but are overcome by
repulsive contributions from the transverse fluctuations which disfavor
$p$-wave pairing compared to $d_{x^2-y^2}$. The sub-leading pair instability is
found to be in the $g$-wave channel, but complex admixtures of $d$ and $g$ are
not energetically favored since their nodal structures coincide. Inclusion of
interband pairing, in which each fermion in the Cooper pair belongs to a
different spin-density-wave band, is considered for a range of electron dopings
in the regime of well-developed magnetic order. We demonstrate that these
interband pairing gaps, which are non-zero in the magnetic state, must have the
same parity under inversion as the normal intraband gaps. The self-consistent
solution to the full system of five coupled gap equations give intraband and

feasibility of a network design can be quickly evaluated by computing the fixed
point of a concave mapping that is constructed based on many environmental and
network control parameters such as the position of base stations, channel
conditions, and antenna tilts. To address this and more general problems, given
a positive concave mapping, we show two alternative but equivalent ways to
construct a matrix that is guaranteed to have spectral radius strictly smaller
than one if the mapping has a fixed point. This matrix is then used to build a
new mapping that preserves the fixed point of the original positive concave
mapping. We show that the standard fixed point iterations using the new mapping
converges faster than the standard iterations applied to the original concave
mapping. As exemplary applications of the proposed methods, we consider the
problems of power and load planning in networks based on the orthogonal
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology.

degrees of freedom are modeled by harmonic oscillators, interacting with a
common quantum field, paying special attention to two less studied yet
important features: finite separation and direct coupling. Distance dependence
is essential in quantum teleportation and relativistic quantum information
considerations. The presence of a quantum field as the environment accords an
indirect interaction between the two oscillators at finite separation of a
non-Markovian nature which competes with the direct coupling between them. The
interplay between these two factors results in a rich variety of interesting
entanglement behaviors at late times. We show that the entanglement behavior
reported in prior work assuming no separation between the detectors can at best
be a transient effect at very short times, and claims that such behaviors
represent late time entanglement are misplaced. Entanglement between the
detectors with direct coupling enters in the consideration of macroscopic
quantum phenomena and other frontline issues. We find that with direct coupling
entanglement between the two detectors can sustain over a finite distance, in
contrast to the no-direct coupling case reported before, where entanglement can
not survive at separation more than a few inverse high frequency cutoff scales.
This work provides a solid platform necessary for further systematic
investigations into the entanglement behavior of continuous variable quantum
systems.

The competition of the production of baryons against that of mesons is the key
dynamics that is most relevant to the change of baryon-strangeness correlation
during system hadronization. Results of quark combination under the Poisson
statistics agree with the statistical model predictions for a hadron resonance
gas at vanishing chemical potential but differ from those at relatively large
chemical potentials. Results beyond Poisson statistics are also obtained and
are compared with calculations of Lattice QCD in the phase boundary, giving the
best agreement at temperature $T =163$ MeV. We predict the dependence of the
$C_{BS}$ of hadron system on the baryon chemical potential and strangeness.
These predictions are expected to be tested by the future Lattice QCD
calculations at non-zero chemical potentials and/or by the Beam Energy Scan

resolution degradation in images acquired through a turbulent medium. Using
this technique, a large number of consecutive short exposures is registered
below the coherence time of the atmosphere or other blurring medium. The
acquired images are shifted to the position of the brightest speckle and
stacked together to obtain high-resolution and high signal-to-noise frame. In
this paper we present a highly efficient method for determination of frames
shifts, even if in a single frame the object cannot be distinguished from the
background noise. The technique utilizes our custom genetic algorithm, which
iteratively evolves a set of image shifts. We used the maximal energy of
stacked images as an objective function for shifts estimation and validate the
efficiency of the method on simulated and real images of simple and complex
sources. Obtained results confirmed, that our proposed method allows for the
recovery of spatial distribution of objects even only 2% brighter than their
background. The presented approach extends significantly current limits of
image reconstruction with the use of shift-and-add method. The applications of
our algorithm include both the optical and the infrared imaging. Our method may
be also employed as a digital image stabilizer in extremely low light level
conditions in professional and consumer applications.

with the representation of tensors in subspace based formats. To do this we use
a property of the so-called minimal subspaces which allows us to describe the
tensor representation by means of a rooted tree. By using the tree structure
and the dimensions of the associated minimal subspaces, we introduce, in the
underlying algebraic tensor space, the set of tensors in a tree-based format
with either bounded or fixed tree-based rank. This class contains the Tucker
format and the Hierarchical Tucker format (including the Tensor Train format).
In particular, we show that the set of tensors in the tree-based format with
bounded (respectively, fixed) tree-based rank of an algebraic tensor product of
normed vector spaces is an analytic Banach manifold. Indeed, the manifold
geometry for the set of tensors with fixed tree-based rank is induced by a
fibre bundle structure and the manifold geometry for the set of tensors with
bounded tree-based rank is given by a finite union of connected components. In
order to describe the relationship between these manifolds and the natural
ambient space, we introduce the definition of topological tensor spaces in the
tree-based format. We prove under natural conditions that any tensor of the
topological tensor space under consideration admits best approximations in the
manifold of tensors in the tree-based format with bounded tree-based rank. In
this framework, we also show that the tangent (Banach) space at a given tensor
is a complemented subspace in the natural ambient tensor Banach space and hence
the set of tensors in the tree-based format with bounded (respectively, fixed)
tree-based rank is an immersed submanifold. This fact allows us to extend the
Dirac-Frenkel variational principle in the framework of topological tensor
spaces.

on a rough substrate. It predicts a continuous transition at some threshold
forcing $\theta_c$, beyond which the particle current grows linearly $J\sim
\theta-\theta_c$, in agreement with experiments. The stationary state is
reached after a transient time $t_{\rm conv}$ which diverges near the
transition as $t_{\rm conv}\sim |\theta-\theta_c|^{-z}$ with $z\approx 2.5$.
The model also makes quantitative testable predictions for the drainage
pattern: the distribution $P(\sigma)$ of local current is found to be extremely
broad with $P(\sigma)\sim J/\sigma$, spatial correlations for the current are
negligible in the direction transverse to forcing, but long-range parallel to
it. We explain some of these features using a scaling argument and a mean-field
approximation that builds an analogy with $q$-models. We discuss the
relationship between our erosion model and models for the depinning transition

saturable absorber (SA) by depositing few-layer BPs with microfiber. The
saturable absorption property of few-layer BPs had been verified through an
open-aperture z-scan measurement at the telecommunication band and the
microfiber-based BP device had been found to show a saturable average power of
~4.5 mW and a modulation depth of 10.9%, which is further confirmed through a
balanced twin detection measurement. By further integrating this optical SA
device into an erbium-doped fiber laser, it was found that it can deliver the
mode-locked pulse with duration down to 940 fs with central wavelength tunable
from 1532 nm to 1570 nm. The prevention of BP from oxidation through the

December 2010. The results are then compared with contemporaneous observations
made by the EPOXI spacecraft. Each ground-based dataset has previously been
investigated individually; the combined dataset has complementary coverage that
reduces the time between observing runs and allows us to determine additional
apparent periods at intermediate times. We compare CN coma morphology between
ground-based datasets, making nine new measurements of apparent periods. The
first five are consistent with the roughly linearly increasing apparent period
during the apparition found by previous authors. The final four suggest that
the change in apparent period slowed or stopped by late November. We also
measure an inner coma lightcurve in both CN and R-band ground-based images,
finding a single-peaked lightcurve which repeats in phase with the coma
morphology. The apparent period from the lightcurve had significantly larger
uncertainties than from the coma morphology, but varied over the apparition in
a similar manner. Our ground-based lightcurve aligns with the published EPOXI
lightcurve, indicating that the lightcurve represents changing activity rather
than viewing geometry of structures in the coma. The EPOXI lightcurve can best
be phased by a triple-peaked period near 54-55 hr that increases from October
to November. This phasing reveals that the spacing between maxima is not
constant, and that the overall lightcurve shape evolves from one triple-peaked
cycle to the next. These behaviors suggest that much of the scatter in apparent
periods derived from ground-based datasets acquired at similar epochs are
likely due to limited sampling of the data.

late eighties in the seminal work by Ben-Or et al. As was recently shown by
Cr\'{e}peau et al., the security of known two-prover commitment schemes not
only relies on the explicit assumption that the provers cannot communicate, but
also depends on their information processing capabilities. For instance, there
exist schemes that are secure against classical provers but insecure if the
provers have quantum information processing capabilities, and there are schemes
that resist such quantum attacks but become insecure when considering general
so-called non-signaling provers, which are restricted solely by the requirement
that no communication takes place.
  This poses the natural question whether there exists a two-prover commitment
scheme that is secure under the sole assumption that no communication takes
place; no such scheme is known.
  In this work, we give strong evidence for a negative answer: we show that any
single-round two-prover commitment scheme can be broken by a non-signaling
attack. Our negative result is as bad as it can get: for any candidate scheme
that is (almost) perfectly hiding, there exists a strategy that allows the
dishonest provers to open a commitment to an arbitrary bit (almost) as
successfully as the honest provers can open an honestly prepared commitment,
i.e., with probability (almost) 1 in case of a perfectly sound scheme. In the
case of multi-round schemes, our impossibility result is restricted to
perfectly hiding schemes.
  On the positive side, we show that the impossibility result can be
circumvented by considering three provers instead: there exists a three-prover
commitment scheme that is secure against arbitrary non-signaling attacks.

suggests a merger dynamics in A2319. The contour map of projected density and
localized velocity structure confirm the so-called A2319B substructure, at ~
10' NW to the main concentration A2319A. The spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of more than 30,000 sources are obtained in our BATC photometry down to
V ~ 20 mag. With color-color diagrams and photometric redshift technique, 233
galaxies brighter than h=19.0 are newly selected as member candidates. The
early-type galaxies are found to follow a tight color-magnitude correlation.
Based on sample I and the enlarged sample of member galaxies (called sample
II), subcluster A2319B is confirmed. A strong environmental effect on star
formation histories is found in the manner that galaxies in the sparse regions
have various star formation histories, while galaxies in the dense regions are
found to have shorter SFR time scales, older stellar ages, and higher ISM
metallicities. For the merging cluster A2319, local surface density is a better
environmental indicator rather than the clustercentric distance. Compared with
the well-relaxed cluster A2589, a higher fraction of star-forming galaxies is
found in A2319, indicating that the galaxy-scale turbulence stimulated by the

a black hole, it might appears that the Hawking radiation would be highly
sensitive to some unknown high energy physics. To study possible deviations
from the Hawking's prediction, the dispersive field theory models have been
proposed, following the Unruh's hydrodynamic analogue of a black hole
radiation. In the dispersive field theory models, the dispersion relations of
matter fields are modified at high energies, which leads to modifications of
equations of motion. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to
investigate the dispersive field theory models. The preferred frame is the
static frame of the black hole. The dispersion relation adopted agrees with the
relativistic one at low energies but is modified near the Planck mass $m_{p}$.
We calculate the corrections to the Hawking temperature for massive and charged
particles to $\mathcal{O}\left(m_{p}^{-2}\right) $ and massless and neutral
particles to all orders. Our results suggest that the thermal spectrum of
radiations near horizon is robust, e.g. corrections to the Hawking temperature
are suppressed by $m_{p}$. After the spectrum of radiations near the horizon is
obtained, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of a
massless scalar field near the horizon of a 4D spherically symmetric black
hole. We find that the leading term of the entropy depends on how the
dispersion relations of matter fields are modified, while the subleading
logarithmic term does not. Finally, the luminosities of black holes are
computed by using the geometric optics approximation.

at high FP levels. By leveraging existing CAD systems, coordinates of regions

step and function as input for a second tier, which is our focus in this study.
In this second stage, we generate $N$ 2D (two-dimensional) or 2.5D views via
sampling through scale transformations, random translations and rotations with
respect to each ROI's centroid coordinates. These random views are used to
train deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) classifiers. In testing, the
trained ConvNets are employed to assign class (e.g., lesion, pathology)
probabilities for a new set of $N$ random views that are then averaged at each
ROI to compute a final per-candidate classification probability. This second

To this end, we introduce a new practical set-membership proof that does not
require provers nor verifiers (but in a specific scenario for verifiers) to
perform pairing computations. It is therefore particularly suitable for our
(ticketing) setting where provers hold SIM/UICC cards that do not support such
costly computations. We also propose several optimizations of Boneh-Boyen type
signature schemes, which are of independent interest, increasing their
performance and efficiency during NFC transactions. Our m-ticketing protocol
offers greater flexibility compared to previous solutions as it enables the
post-payment and the off-line validation of m-tickets. By implementing a
prototype using a standard NFC SIM card, we show that it fulfils the stringent
functional requirement imposed by transport operators whilst using strong
security parameters. In particular, a validation can be completed in 184.25 ms
when the mobile is switched on, and in 266.52 ms when the mobile is switched
off or its battery is flat.

this research model of collaborative learning in an organizational social

of a knowledge flow. The nodes, which represent knowledge workers, contain
information about workers social and cognitive abilities. Moreover, the workers
are described by their set of competences, their skill level, and the
collaborative learning behavior that can be detected through knowledge flow
analysis. The proposed approach assumes that an increase in workers competence
is a result of collaborative learning. In other words, collaborative learning
can be analyzed as a process of knowledge flow that is being broadcast in a
network. In order to create a more effective organizational social network for
co-learning, the authors found the best strategies for knowledge facilitator,
knowledge collector, and expert roles allocation. Special attention is paid to
the process of knowledge flow in the community of practice. Acceleration within
the community of practice happens when knowledge flows more effectively between
community members. The presented procedure makes it possible to add new ties to

there exist systems and functions such that the approximation process is weakly
divergent, i.e., divergent for certain subsequences. Here we strengthen this
result by proving strong divergence, i.e., divergence for all subsequences.
Further, in case of divergence, we give the divergence speed. We consider
sampling at Nyquist rate as well as oversampling with adaptive choice of the
kernel. Finally, connections between strong divergence and the Banach-Steinhaus
theorem, which is not powerful enough to prove strong divergence, are
discussed.

powerful and successful methods for solving various composite problems. The
convergence of the conventional ADMM (i.e., 2-block) for convex objective
functions has been justified for a long time, and its convergence for nonconvex
objective functions has, however, been established very recently. The
multi-block ADMM, a natural extension of ADMM, is a widely used scheme and has
also been found very useful in solving various nonconvex optimization problems.
It is thus expected to establish convergence theory of the multi-block ADMM
under nonconvex frameworks. In this paper we present a Bregman modification of
3-block ADMM and establish its convergence for a large family of nonconvex
functions. We further extend the convergence results to the $N$-block case ($N

nonconvex settings. Finally, we present a simulation study and a real-world

further insight into the relationship between these various emission phenomena

fraction forty-times greater than that of the more regularly-emitting 'bright'

assumed to be nulling continuously. PSR B0823+26 shows a further decrease in
average flux just before the transition into the B-mode, and perhaps truly
turns off completely at these times. Furthermore, simultaneous observations
taken with the LOFAR, Westerbork, Lovell, and Effelsberg telescopes between 110

the accelerated cosmic expansion. Although it is usually assumed that the
quasi-Newtonian approach (a combination of the quasi-static approximation and
sub-Hubble limit) for cosmic perturbations is good enough to describe the
evolution of large scale structure in $f(R)$ models, some studies have
suggested that this method is not valid for all $f(R)$ models. Here, we show
that in the matter-dominated era, the pressure and shear equations alone, which
can be recast into four first-order equations to solve for cosmological
perturbations exactly, are sufficient to solve for the Newtonian potential,
$\Psi$, and the curvature potential, $\Phi$. Based on these two equations, we
are able to clarify how the exact linear perturbations fit into different

$f(R)$ gravity. In addition, regardless the validity of quasi-static
approximation, a strong version of the sub-Hubble limit alone is sufficient to
reduce the exact linear perturbations in any viable $f(R)$ gravity to second

study the possibility of inducing fluctuations to the entropy of the dark

Therefore, we find a relation between the thermal fluctuations and the mutual
interaction between the cosmos sectors, whiles the dark energy candidate has a
varying energy density. We point to models in which a gravitationally induced
particle production process leads to change the expansion eras, whiles the
corresponding pressure is considered as the cause of current acceleration

thermal fluctuations into the system. We also find an expression between the

Hayward-Kodama temperature to get a relation for the horizon entropy in models

shows that the first law of thermodynamics is available on the apparent horizon

theory and estimates of the minimum error constraints, including not only on

drift in focal length and so on, margins of in-flight error sources and the

  20-29",,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inviscid Burgers equation is one of the simplest nonlinear hyperbolic
conservation law which provides a variety examples for many topics in nonlinear
partial differential equations such as wave propagation, shocks and
perturbation, and it can easily be derived by the Euler equations of
compressible fluids by imposing zero pressure in the given system. Recently,
several versions of the relativistic Burgers equations have been derived on
different geometries such as Minkowski (flat), Schwarzshild and FLRW spacetimes
by LeFloch and his collaborators. In this paper, we consider a family member of
the FLRW spacetime so-called the de Sitter background, introduce some important
features of this spacetime geometry with its metric and derive the relativistic
Burgers equation on it. The Euler system of equations on the de Sitter
spacetime can be found by a known process by using the Christoffel symbols and
tensors for perfect fluids. We applied the usual techniques used for the
Schwarzshild and FLRW spacetimes in order to derive the relativistic Burgers
equation from the vanishing pressure Euler system on the de Sitter background.
We observed that the model admits static solutions. In the final part, we
examined several numerical illustrations of the given model through a finite
volume approximation based on the paper by LeFloch et al. The effect of the
cosmological constant is also numerically analysed in this part. Furthermore, a
comparison of the static solution with the Lax Friedrichs scheme is implemented
so that the results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the finite
volume scheme for the derived model

substrates for the design of programmable molecular machinery and circuitry.
Domain-level reaction enumerators provide the foundations for molecular
programming languages by formalizing DNA strand displacement mechanisms and
modeling interactions at the ""domain"" level - one level of abstraction above
models that explicitly describe DNA strand sequences. Unfortunately, the
most-developed models currently only treat pseudo-linear DNA structures, while
many systems being experimentally and theoretically pursued exploit a much
broader range of secondary structure configurations. Here, we describe a new
domain-level reaction enumerator that can handle arbitrary non-pseudoknotted
secondary structures and reaction mechanisms including association and
dissociation, 3-way and 4-way branch migration, and direct as well as remote
toehold activation. To avoid polymerization that is inherent when considering
general structures, we employ a time-scale separation technique that holds in
the limit of low concentrations. This also allows us to ""condense"" the detailed
reactions by eliminating fast transients, with provable guarantees of
correctness for the set of reactions and their kinetics. We hope that the new
reaction enumerator will be used in new molecular programming languages,
compilers, and tools for analysis and verification that treat a wider variety
of mechanisms of interest to experimental and theoretical work. We have
implemented this enumerator in Python, and it is included in the DyNAMiC
Workbench Integrated Development Environment.

Higgins, and Ethan Schonbrun","Single-cell measurement of red blood cell oxygen affinity",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Oxygen is transported throughout the body by hemoglobin in red blood cells.
While the oxygen affinity of blood is well understood and is routinely assessed
in patients by pulse oximetry, variability at the single-cell level has not
been previously measured. In contrast, single-cell measurements of red blood
cell volume and hemoglobin concentration are taken millions of times per day by
clinical hematology analyzers and are important factors in determining the
health of the hematologic system. To better understand the variability and
determinants of oxygen affinity on a cellular level, we have developed a system
that quantifies the oxygen saturation, cell volume and hemoglobin concentration
for individual red blood cells in high-throughput. We find that the variability
in single-cell saturation peaks at an oxygen partial pressure of 2.5%, which
corresponds to the maximum slope of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.
In addition, single-cell oxygen affinity is positively correlated with
hemoglobin concentration, but independent of osmolarity, which suggests
variation in the hemoglobin to 2-3 DPG ratio on a cellular level. By
quantifying the functional behavior of a cellular population, our system adds a
new dimension to blood cell analysis and other measurements of single-cell
variability.
