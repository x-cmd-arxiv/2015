of study. The present paper addresses the flip side of superradiance, i.e.
subradiance. Single photon subradiant states are potentially stable against
collective spontaneous emission and can have ultrafast readout. In particular
it is shown how many atom collective effects provide a new way to control
spontaneous emission by preparing and switching between subradiant and

understanding the nature of superconductivity. Among the iron-based
superconductors, the iron chalcogenide family exhibits the strongest electron
correlations. To gauge the correlation strength, we performed systematic
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study on the iron chalcogenide series
Fe$_{1+y}$Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ (0$<$x$<$0.59), a model system with the simplest
structure. Our measurement reveals an incoherent to coherent crossover in the
electronic structure as the selenium ratio increases and the system evolves
from the weakly localized to more itinerant state. Furthermore, we found that
the effective mass of bands dominated by the d$_{xy}$ orbital character
significantly decreases with increasing selenium ratio, as compared to the
d$_{xz}$/d$_{yz}$ orbital-dominated bands. The orbital dependent change in the
correlation level agrees with theoretical calculations on the band structure
renormalization, and may help to understand the onset of superconductivity in
Fe$_{1+y}$Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$.

addressed only in equilibrium. In this work we explore dynamical cooperativity
in driven systems, where the cooperation occurs because some of the bonds
change the dynamical response of the system to a regime where the other bonds
become active. To investigate such cooperativity we study the frictional
binding between two flow driven surfaces that interact through a large
population of activated bonds. In particular, we study systems where each bond
can have two different modes: one mode corresponds to a fast forming yet weak
bond, and the other is a strong yet slow forming bond. We find considerable
cooperativity between both types of bonds. Under some conditions the system
behaves as if there were only one binding mode, corresponding to a strong and
fast forming bond. Our results may have important implications on the friction
and adhesion between sliding surfaces containing complementary binding motifs,
such as in the case of cells binding to the vessel walls under strong flowing
conditions.

communications will become critical. However, multicast protocols do not fit
the point-to-point model of most network security protocols which were designed
with unicast communications in mind. In recent years, we have seen the
emergence and the growing of ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines) in banking
systems. Many banks are extending their activity and increasing transactions by
using ATMs. ATM will allow them to reach more customers in a cost effective way
and to make their transactions fast and efficient. However, communicating in
the network must satisfy integrity, privacy, confidentiality, authentication
and non-repudiation. Many frameworks have been implemented to provide security
in communication and transactions. In this paper, we analyze ATM communication
protocol and propose a novel framework for ATM systems that allows entities
communicate in a secure way without using a lot of storage. We describe the
architecture and operation of SFAMSS in detail. Our framework is implemented
with Java and the software architecture, and its components are studied in

the time evolution of the static density-density correlation in the interacting

approach to equilibrium with power law $t^{-3}$ which turns out to be

only does it deliver a differential observable providing extra contrast, but
when coupled with spectroscopy, it also reveals valuable information on the
exoplanetary atmospheric composition. Nevertheless, angular separation and
contrast ratio to the host-star make for extremely challenging observation.
Producing detailed predictions for exactly how the expected signals should
appear is of critical importance for the designs and observational strategies
of tomorrow's telescopes. We aim at accurately determining the magnitudes and
evolution of the main observational signatures for imaging an exoplanet:
separation, contrast ratio to the host-star and polarization as a function of
the orbital geometry and the reflectance parameters of the exoplanet. These
parameters were used to construct polarized-reflectance model based on the
input of orbital parameters and two albedo values. The model is able to
calculate a variety of observational predictions for exoplanets at any orbital
time. The inter-dependency of the three main observational criteria
-separation, contrast ratio, polarization- result in a complex time-evolution
of the system. They greatly affect the viability of planet observation by
direct imaging. We introduce a new generic display of the main observational
criteria, which enables an observer to determine whether an exoplanet is within
detection limits: the Separation-POlarization-Contrast diagrams (SPOC). We
explore the complex effect of orbital and albedo parameters on the visibility
of an exoplanet. The code we developed is available for public use and
collaborative improvement on the python package index, together with its
documentation. It is another step towards a full comprehensive simulation tool
for predicting and interpreting the results of future observational
exoplanetary discovery campaigns.

Nielsen and Chuang, we introduce the generalised concept of states (density
matrices), observables (POVMs) and transformations (channels), but we also
characterise these structures from an algebraic standpoint, which provides many
useful technical tools, and clarity as to their generality. This approach also
makes it manifest that quantum theory is a direct generalisation of probability
theory, and provides a unifying formalism for both fields. The focus on
finite-dimensional systems allows for a self-contained presentation which

is the third nearest populous galaxy cluster after Fornax and Virgo (d $\sim

population located at the cluster centre. Now, we extend our study covering an
area four times larger, calculating new total magnitudes and colours, instead
of isophotal photometry, as well as structural parameters obtained through
S\'ersic model fits extrapolated to infinity. Our present work involves a total
of 177 ETGs, out of them 56 per cent have been cataloged by FS90 while the rest
(77 galaxies) are newly discovered ones. Medium-resolution GEMINI and VLT
spectra are used to confirm membership when available. Including radial
velocities from the literature, 59 ETGs are confirmed as Antlia members. Antlia
scaling relations mainly support the existence of unique functions (linear and
curved) that join bright and dwarf ETGs, excluding compact ellipticals (cEs).
Lenticular galaxies are outliers only with respect to the curved relation
derived for effective surface brightness versus absolute magnitude. The small
number of bright ellipticals and cEs present in Antlia, prevents us from
testing if the same data can be fitted with two different linear sequences, for
bright and dwarf ETGs. However, adding data from other clusters and groups, the
existence of such sequences is also noticeable in the same scaling relations.

Understanding the impact of baryonic physics on galaxy shapes and alignments
and their relation to the dark matter distribution should prove useful to map
the intrinsic alignments of galaxies from hydrodynamic to dark matter-only
simulations. We find that dark matter subhalos are typically rounder in MBII,
and the shapes of stellar matter in low mass galaxies are more misaligned with
the shapes of the dark matter of the corresponding subhalos in the DMO
simulation. At $z=0.06$, the fractional difference in the mean misalignment
angle between MBII and DMO simulations varies from $\sim 28 \% - 12 \%$ in the
mass range $10^{10.8} - 6.0 \times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. We study the dark
matter halo shapes and alignments as a function of radius, and find that while
galaxies in MBII are more aligned with the inner parts of their dark matter
subhalos, there is no radial trend in their alignments with the corresponding
subhalo in the DMO simulation. This result highlights the importance of
baryonic physics in determining the alignment of the galaxy with respect to the
inner parts of the halo. Finally, we compare the ellipticity-direction (ED)
correlation for galaxies to that for dark matter halos, finding that it is
suppressed on all scales by stellar-dark matter misalignment. In the projected
shape-density correlation ($w_{\delta+}$), which includes ellipticity
weighting, this effect is partially canceled by the higher mean ellipticities
of the stellar component, but differences of order $30-40\%$ remain on scales

operators are not completely determined by a basis, so the potential exists to
tailor SBP operators to meet different objectives. To date, application of
high-order SBP discretizations to multiple dimensions has been limited to
tensor product domains. This paper presents a definition for multi-dimensional
SBP finite-difference operators that is a natural extension of one-dimensional
SBP operators. Theoretical implications of the definition are investigated for
the special case of a diagonal norm (mass) matrix. In particular, a
diagonal-norm SBP operator exists on a given domain if and only if there is a
cubature rule with positive weights on that domain and the polynomial-basis
matrix has full rank when evaluated at the cubature nodes. Appropriate
simultaneous-approximation terms are developed to impose boundary conditions
weakly, and the resulting discretizations are shown to be time stable. Concrete
examples of multi-dimensional SBP operators are constructed for the triangle
and tetrahedron; similarities and differences with spectral-element and
spectral-difference methods are discussed. An assembly process is described
that builds diagonal-norm SBP operators on a global domain from element-level
operators. Numerical results of linear advection on a doubly periodic domain
demonstrate the accuracy and time stability of the simplex operators.

election, initial path construction, subtree contraction, geometric
straightening, and distributed sorting), none of which requires a central

data, less attention has been paid to time series. The goal in this setting is
to determine conditional independence relations between entire time series,
which for stationary series, are encoded by zeros in the inverse spectral
density matrix. We take a Bayesian approach to structure learning, placing
priors on (i) the graph structure and (ii) spectral matrices given the graph.
We leverage a Whittle likelihood approximation and define a conjugate
prior---the hyper complex inverse Wishart---on the complex-valued and
graph-constrained spectral matrices. Due to conjugacy, we can analytically
marginalize the spectral matrices and obtain a closed-form marginal likelihood
of the time series given a graph. Importantly, our analytic marginal likelihood
allows us to avoid inference of the complex spectral matrices themselves and
places us back into the framework of standard (Bayesian) structure learning. In
particular, combining this marginal likelihood with our graph prior leads to
efficient inference of the time series graph itself, which we base on a
stochastic search procedure, though any standard approach can be
straightforwardly modified to our time series case. We demonstrate our methods
on analyzing stock data and neuroimaging data of brain activity during various

(gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism
responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into
quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through
outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative
mechanism is so-called ""strangulation"", in which the supply of cold gas to the
galaxy is halted. Here we report that the difference between quiescent and star
forming galaxies in terms of stellar metallicity (i.e. the fraction of metals
heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) can be used to discriminate
efficiently between the two mechanisms. The analysis of the stellar metallicity
in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, clearly reveals that strangulation is
the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical
timescale of 4 billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass
less than 10^11 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by
the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which
indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10^11 solar masses are on
average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.

in various different star formation laws, all having substantial intrinsic
scatter. Extending upon previous works that define the column density of star
formation (Sigma_SFR) by the gas column density (Sigma_gas), we develop a new
universal star formation (SF) law based on the multi-freefall prescription of
gas. This new SF law relies predominantly on the probability density function
(PDF) and on the sonic Mach number of the turbulence in the star-forming
clouds. By doing so we derive a relation where the star formation rate (SFR)
correlates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time, whereas
previous models had used the average, single-freefall time. We define a new
quantity called maximum (multi-freefall) gas consumption rate (MGCR) and show
that the actual SFR is only about 0.4% of this maximum possible SFR, confirming
the observed low efficiency of star formation. We show that placing
observations in this new framework (Sigma_SFR vs. MGCR) yields a significantly
improved correlation with 3-4 times reduced scatter compared to previous SF
laws and a goodness-of-fit parameter R^2=0.97. By inverting our new
relationship, we provide sonic Mach number predictions for kpc-scale
observations of Local Group galaxies as well as unresolved observations of
local and high-redshift disk and starburst galaxies that do not have

two very different outcomes are possible, depending on whether or not the

destroy the topological phase for $\alpha\lesssim3$, the topological phase

This is a further development of the publicly available code SMILE; its main
improvements include a new efficient representation of an arbitrary
gravitational potential using two-dimensional spline interpolation of Fourier
coefficients in the meridional plane, as well as the ability to deal with
rotation of the density profile and with multicomponent mass models. We compare
several published methods for constructing composite axisymmetric
disc--bulge--halo models and demonstrate that our code produces the models that
are closest to equilibrium. We also apply it to create models of triaxial
elliptical galaxies with cuspy density profiles and figure rotation, and find
that such models can be found and are stable over many dynamical times in a
wide range of pattern speeds and angular momenta, covering both slow- and
fast-rotator classes. We then attempt to create models of strongly barred disc
galaxies, using an analytic three-component potential, and find that it is not
possible to make a stable dynamically self-consistent model for this density
profile. Finally, we take snapshots of two N-body simulations of barred disc
galaxies embedded in nearly-spherical haloes, and construct equilibrium models
using only information on the density profile of the snapshots. We demonstrate
that such reconstructed models are in near-stationary state, in contrast with

after they are kinetically decoupled from the thermal bath, and consequently
goldstinos with different momentum decouple at different temperatures. As a
result their momentum distribution function shows a peculiar shape and the
final yield is smaller than if kinetic equilibrium was assumed. We revisit the
cosmological implications in both R-parity-conserving and R-parity-violating

Methods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imaging
data usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dust
masses derived from the observed FIR emission. High-quality optical data from
the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS) and FIR/submm observations from
the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) allow us to revisit previous methods
to determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones. We aim to
derive the dust mass in NGC 4370 from both optical and FIR data, and
investigate the need to invoke a putative diffuse dust component. We create
color and attenuation maps, which are converted to approximate dust mass maps
based on simple dust geometries. Dust masses are also derived from SED fits to
FIR/submm observations. Finally, inverse radiative transfer fitting is
performed to investigate more complex dust geometries. The empirical methods
applied to the optical data yield lower limits of 3.4e5 solar masses, an order
of magnitude below the total dust masses derived from SED fitting. In contrast,
radiative transfer models yield dust masses which are slightly lower, but fully
consistent with the FIR-derived mass. Dust is more likely to be distributed in
a ring around the centre of NGC 4370 as opposed to an exponential disc or a
simple foreground screen. Moreover, using inverse radiative transfer fitting,
we are able to constrain most of the parameters describing these geometries.
The resulting dust masses are high enough to account for the dust observed at
FIR/submm wavelengths, so that no diffuse dust component needs to be invoked.
We furthermore caution for the interpretation of dust masses and optical depths
based on optical data alone, using overly simplistic star-dust geometries and
the neglect of scattering effects. [ABRIDGED]

$M_{BH} = 30 M_{\odot}$ and $M_{BH} = 10^4 M_{\odot}$. Attention is
concentrated on the effect of the dynamical friction by gas in a host object.
The simulations incorporate such general relativistic effects as the pericentre
shift and gravitational wave emission. As a result, we find that multiple BHs
are able to merge into one BH within 100 Myr in a wide range of BH density. The
merger mechanism is revealed to be categorized into three types:
gas-drag-driven merger (type A), interplay-driven merger (type B), and
three-body-driven merger (type C). We find the relation between the merger
mechanism and the ratio of the gas mass within the initial BH orbit ($M_{gas}$)
to the total BH mass (${\Sigma}M_{BH}$). Type A merger occurs if $M_{gas}
\gtrsim 10^5 {\Sigma}M_{BH}$, type B if $M_{gas} \lesssim 10^5 {\Sigma}M_{BH}$,
and type C if $M_{gas} \ll 10^5 {\Sigma}M_{BH}$. Supposing the gas and BH
density based on the recent numerical simulations on first stars, all the BH
remnants from first stars are likely to merge into one BH through the type B or
C mechanism. Also, we find that multiple massive BHs ($M_{BH} = 10^4
M_{\odot}$) distributed over several parsec can merge into one BH through the
type B mechanism, if the gas density is higher than $5\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$.
The present results imply that the BH merger may contribute significantly to
the formation of supermassive BHs at high redshift epochs.

5 Earth-mass planet on a fixed circular orbit, simulated using our multi-GPU
hydrodynamics code PEnGUIn. We find that, overall, the horseshoe region has a
columnar structure extending vertically much beyond the Hill sphere of the
planet. This columnar structure is only broken for some of the widest horseshoe
streamlines, along which high altitude fluid descends rapidly into the planet's
Bondi sphere, performs one horseshoe turn, and exits the Bondi sphere radially
in the midplane. A portion of this flow exits the horseshoe region altogether,
which we refer to as the ""transient"" horseshoe flow. The flow continues as it
rolls up into a pair of up-down symmetric horizontal vortex lines shed into the
wake of the planet. This flow, unique to 3D, affects both planet accretion and
migration. It prevents the planet from sustaining a hydrostatic atmosphere due
to its intrusion into the Bondi sphere, and leads to a significant corotation
torque on the planet, unanticipated by 2D analysis. In the reported simulation,
starting with a $\Sigma\sim r^{-3/2}$ radial surface density profile, this
torque is positive and partially cancels with the negative differential
Lindblad torque, resulting in a factor of 3 slower planet migration rate.
Finally, we report 3D effects can be suppressed by a sufficiently large disk
viscosity, leading to results similar to 2D.

formation for interacting galaxies in central regions as reported by previous
studies; however, the specific star formation is comparable when observed in
extended regions. We find that control and interacting star-forming galaxies
have similar oxygen abundances in their central regions, when normalized to
their stellar masses. Oxygen abundances of these interacting galaxies seem to
decrease compared to the control objects at the large aperture sizes measured
in effective radius. Although the enhancement in central star formation and
lower metallicities for interacting galaxies have been attributed to tidally
induced inflows, our results suggest that other processes such as stellar
feedback can contribute to the metal enrichment in interacting galaxies.

in which a scalar field adiabatically traces the minimum of an effective
potential sourced by the dark matter density. We discuss extensively the effect
of this coupling on cosmological observables, especially the parameter
degeneracies expected to arise between the model parameters and other
cosmological parameters, and then test the model against observations of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and other cosmological probes.
We find that the chameleon parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which determine
respectively the slope of the scalar field potential and the dark matter-dark
energy coupling strength, can be constrained to $\alpha < 0.17$ and $\beta <
0.19$ using CMB data alone. The latter parameter in particular is constrained
only by the late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Adding measurements of the
local Hubble expansion rate $H_0$ tightens the bound on $\alpha$ by a factor of
two, although this apparent improvement is arguably an artefact of the tension
between the local measurement and the $H_0$ value inferred from Planck data in
the minimal $\Lambda$CDM model. The same argument also precludes chameleon
models from mimicking a dark radiation component, despite a passing similarity
between the two scenarios in that they both delay the epoch of matter-radiation
equality. Based on the derived parameter constraints, we discuss possible
signatures of the model for ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys.

the geodesic equations in Hamiltonian form and solve perturbatively for the

of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the phase modulation obtained under wave optics.
Turning then to wave optics - rather than solving Maxwell's equations directly
for the fields, as in most previous approaches - we derive a perturbed wave
equation (perturbed by the gravitational wave) for the electromagnetic
four-potential. From this wave equation it follows that the four-potential and

is increasing recognized as a crucial feature in neural processing. Despite its
importance, this physiological feature has traditionally been neglected in
theoretical studies of cortical neural networks. Thus, there is still a lot
unknown about the consequences of cellular and circuit heterogeneity in spiking
neural networks. In particular, combining network or synaptic heterogeneity and
intrinsic heterogeneity has yet to be considered systematically despite the
fact that both are known to exist and likely have significant roles in neural
network dynamics. In a canonical recurrent spiking neural network model, we
study how these two forms of heterogeneity lead to different distributions of
excitatory firing rates. To analytically characterize how these types of
heterogeneities affect the network, we employ a dimension reduction method that
relies on a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and probability density
function equations. We find that the relationship between intrinsic and network
heterogeneity has a strong effect on the overall level of heterogeneity of the
firing rates. Specifically, this relationship can lead to amplification or
attenuation of firing rate heterogeneity, and these effects depend on whether
the recurrent network is firing asynchronously or rhythmically firing. These
observations are captured with the aforementioned reduction method, and
furthermore simpler analytic descriptions based on this dimension reduction
method are developed. The final analytic descriptions provide compact and
descriptive formulas for how the relationship between intrinsic and network
heterogeneity determines the firing rate heterogeneity dynamics in various
settings.

expression of the moment of inertia (MOI) of a neutron star as a function of
observables from a hypothetical r-mode gravitational wave detection. For a
given r-mode detection we show how the value of the MOI of a neutron star
constrains the equation of state (EOS) of the matter in the core of the neutron
star. Subsequently, for each candidate EOS, we derive a possible value of the
saturation amplitude, \alpha, of the r-mode oscillations on the neutron star.
Additionally, we argue that a r-mode detection will provide clues about the
cooling rate mechanism of the neutron star. The above physics that can be
derived from a hypothetical r-mode detection constitute our motivation for the
second part of the paper. In that part we present a detection strategy to
efficiently search for r-modes in gravitational-wave data. R-mode signals were
injected into simulated noise colored with the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and
Einstein Telescope (ET) sensitivity curves. The r-mode waveforms used are those
predicted by early theories based on a polytropic equation of state (EOS)
neutron star matter. In our best case scenario \alpha of order 10^{-1}, the
maximum detection distance when using the aLIGO sensitivity curve is 1 Mpc
(supernova event rate of 3-4 per century) while the maximum detection distance
when using the ET sensitivity curve is 10 Mpc (supernova event rate of 1-2 per
year).

  Multipath",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localization of radio frequency sources over multipath channels is a
difficult problem arising in applications such as outdoor or indoor gelocation.
Common approaches that combine ad-hoc methods for multipath mitigation with
indirect localization relying on intermediary parameters such as
time-of-arrivals, time difference of arrivals or received signal strengths,
provide limited performance. This work models the localization of known
waveforms over unknown multipath channels in a sparse framework, and develops a
direct approach in which multiple sources are localized jointly, directly from
observations obtained at distributed sources. The proposed approach exploits
channel properties that enable to distinguish line-of-sight (LOS) from non-LOS
signal paths. Theoretical guarantees are established for correct recovery of
the sources' locations by atomic norm minimization. A second-order cone-based
algorithm is developed to produce the optimal atomic decomposition, and it is
shown to produce high accuracy location estimates over complex scenes, in which
sources are subject to diverse multipath conditions, including lack of LOS.

three-member synuclein family. It has been extensively studied due to its
misfolding/aggregation in and genetic linkage to neurodegenerative diseases,
especially Parkinson's disease (PD). To better understand its biology, models
of SNCA toxicity have been developed in budding yeast over the past decade,
which have yielded insights into the protein's modes of action in specific
pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Given that the synuclein gene
family is not present in yeast, an extensive homology search was undertaken to
determine if any yeast protein may possess structural homology to SNCA and
whose native biology may shed more light on SNCA's pathomechanism in
eukaryotes. We identified Zeo1, a membrane-associated protein involved in the
cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, as a candidate structural homolog. We show
that Zeo1 overexpression is toxic in yeast and, similar to SNCA, localizes to
lipid membranes. A number of biochemical similarities between Zeo1 and SNCA
also become apparent in light of this potential structural connection.
Moreover, the yeast PKC1 gene, a kinase acting as a downstream signaling hub in
the CWI pathway, rescues both SNCA- and Zeo1-induced toxicities. Using the same
homology search methods that identified Zeo1, we show that Pkc1 has a hybrid
structural similarity to PINK1 and PARIS, two mitochondrial PD-implicated
proteins not generally linked directly to synuclein-specific pathobiology.
Overall, this proof-of-concept study shows the potential utility of hitherto
uncharacterized cross-species structural homologs, identified using comparative
proteome-wide structure prediction algorithms, in shedding light on abstruse
connections among disease-relevant proteins.

any other discovered to date - albeit on a larger, younger, and more dramatic
scale - featuring four giant planets and two debris belts. The first belt lies
beyond the orbit of the outer planet, and mirrors our Solar system's
Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. The second belt lies interior to the orbit of the inner
planet, HR8799e, and is analogous to our Asteroid Belt. With such a similar
architecture, the system is a valuable laboratory for examining exoplanet
dynamics, and the interaction between debris disks and planets.
  In recent years, HR8799's outer disk has been relatively well characterised,
primarily using the Herschel Space Observatory. In contrast, the inner disk,
too close to HR8799 to be spatially resolved by Herschel, remains poorly
understood. This leaves significant questions over both the location of the
planetesimals responsible for producing the observed dust, and the physical
properties of those grains.
  We have performed extensive simulations of HR8799's inner, unresolved debris
belt, using UNSW Australia's supercomputing facility, Katana. Here, we present
the results of integrations following the evolution of a belt of dynamically
hot debris interior to the orbit of HR8799e, for a period of 60 Myr, using an
initial population of 500,000 massless test particles. These simulations have
enable the characterisation of the extent and structure of the inner belt,
revealing that its outer edge must lie interior to the 3:1 mean-motion
resonance with HR8799, at approximately 7.5au, and highlighting the presence of
fine structure analogous to the Solar system's Kirkwood gaps. In the future,
out results will allow us to calculate a first estimate of the small-body
impact rate and water delivery prospects for any potential terrestrial
planet(s) that might lurk, undetected, in the inner system.

absorption features or P Cygni profiles, both evidence of a wind driven by the
accretion. Some lines show a broad double-peaked absorption feature, evidence
of disk rotation. However, the wind-driven and disk-driven spectroscopic
features are anti-correlated in time; the disk features became strong as the
wind features disappeared. This anti-correlation might indicate that the
rebuilding of the inner disk was interrupted by the wind pressure during the
first two years. The Half-Width at Half-Depth (HWHD) of the double-peaked
profiles decreases with wavelength, indicative of the Keplerian rotation; the
optical spectra with the disk feature are fitted by a G5 template stellar

is to place the telescopes in space satellites, which produce observations
without any (or limited) atmospheric aberrations. However, even though the
images from space are not affected by atmospheric seeing, the optical
properties of the instruments still limit the observations. In the case of
diffraction limited observations, the PSF establishes the maximum allowed
spatial resolution, defined as the distance between two nearby structures that
can be properly distinguished. In addition, the shape of the PSF induce a
dispersion of the light from different parts of the image, leading to what is
commonly termed as stray light or dispersed light. This effect produces that
light observed in a spatial location at the focal plane is a combination of the
light emitted in the object at relatively distant spatial locations. We aim to
correct the effect produced by the telescope's PSF using a deconvolution
method, and we decided to apply the code on Hinode/SP quiet Sun observations.
We analyze the validity of the deconvolution process with noisy data and we

Saliency Aggregating various bottom-up cues and priors. It generates spatially
coherent yet detail-preserving, pixel-accurate and fine-grained saliency, and
overcomes the limitations of previous methods which use homogeneous
superpixel-based and color only treatment. PISA aggregates multiple saliency
cues in a global context such as complementary color and structure contrast
measures with their spatial priors in the image domain. The saliency confidence
is further jointly modeled with a neighborhood consistence constraint into an
energy minimization formulation, in which each pixel will be evaluated with
multiple hypothetical saliency levels. Instead of using global discrete
optimization methods, we employ the cost-volume filtering technique to solve
our formulation, assigning the saliency levels smoothly while preserving the
edge-aware structure details. In addition, a faster version of PISA is
developed using a gradient-driven image sub-sampling strategy to greatly
improve the runtime efficiency while keeping comparable detection accuracy.
Extensive experiments on a number of public datasets suggest that PISA
convincingly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, with
this work we also create a new dataset containing $800$ commodity images for
evaluating saliency detection. The dataset and source code of PISA can be

particular applications in accurate simulation of polygonal invisibility
cloaks, concentrators and circular rotators arisen from the field of
transformation electromagnetics (TE). In practice, we adopt a transparent
boundary condition (TBC) characterized by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map to
reduce wave propagation in an unbounded domain to a bounded domain. We then
introduce a semi-analytic technique to integrate the global TBC with local
curvilinear elements seamlessly, which is accomplished by using a novel
elemental mapping and analytic formulas for evaluating global Fourier
coefficients on spectral-element grids exactly.
  From the perspective of TE, an invisibility cloak is devised by a singular
coordinate transformation of Maxwell's equations that leads to anisotropic
materials coating the cloaked region to render any object inside invisible to
observers outside. An important issue resides in the imposition of appropriate
conditions at the outer boundary of the cloaked region, i.e., cloaking boundary
conditions (CBCs), in order to achieve perfect invisibility. Following the
spirit of [48], we propose new CBCs for polygonal invisibility cloaks from the
essential ""pole"" conditions related to singular transformations. This allows
for the decoupling of the governing equations of inside and outside the cloaked
regions. With this efficient spectral-element solver at our disposal, we can
study the interesting phenomena when some defects and lossy or dispersive media

maximize revenue earned from each advertiser by exposing their ads to as many
people as possible, one the other hand, the platform wants to reduce
free-riding to ensure the truthfulness of the advertiser. To access this
tradeoff, we adopt the concept of \emph{regret} \citep{viral2015social} to
measure the performance of an ad allocation scheme. In particular, we study two
social advertising problems: \emph{budgeted social advertising problem} and
\emph{unconstrained social advertising problem}. In the first problem, we aim
at selecting a set of seeds for each advertiser that minimizes the regret while
setting budget constraints on the attention cost; in the second problem, we
propose to optimize a linear combination of the regret and attention costs. We
prove that both problems are NP-hard, and then develop a constant factor
approximation algorithm for each problem.

isostructural with PbTiO$_3$, while simultaneously the $d^6$ Co$^{3+}$ ion has
a high spin ground state with $C$-type antiferromagnetic ordering. Using hybrid
density functional calculations, we investigate the atomic, electronic and
magnetic structure of BiCoO$_3$ to elucidate the origin of the multiferroic
state. To begin with, we perform a qualitative trend sudy of the role of $d$
electrons in affecting the tendency for perovskite materials to exhibit a
ferroelectric distortion; this work initially explores a qualitative trend
study in artificial cubic and tetragonal LaBO$_3$ perovskites. We choose La as
the A-cation so as to remove the effects of Bi $6s$ hybridization. Through
first-principles calculations of the LaBO$_3$ series, where B is a $d^0 - d^8$
cation from the $3d$-block, the trend study reveals that increasing the $d$
orbital occupation initially removes the tendency for a polar distortion, as
expected. However, for high spin $d^5-d^7$ and $d^8$ cations a strong
ferroelectric instability is recovered. We explained this effect in terms of
the pseudo Jahn-Teller theory for ferroelectricity. It is shown that, in some
cases, unpaired electron spins actually drive ferroelectricity, rather than
inhibit it, which represents a shift in the understanding of how
ferroelectricity and magnetism interact in perovskite oxides. It follows, that
for the case of BiCoO$_3$, the Co$^{3+}$ ion plays a major role in the
ferroelectric lattice instability. Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization
is greatly enhanced when the Co$^{3+}$ ion is in the high spin state, when
compared to the nonmagnetic, low spin state, and a large coupling of the
electrical and magnetic polarization is present. Importantly, it is
demonstrated that the ground spin state is switched by reducing the internal
ferroelectric polarization.

stronger property of being uniformly accurate (UA) with respect to

associated with r-modes and claimed that it should lead to magnetic field
enhancement and suppression of r-mode instability in magnetized neutron stars.
We critically revise these results. We present a particular second order r-mode
solution with vanishing secular drift, thus refuting a widely believed
statement that secular drift is an unavoidable feature of r-modes. This
non-drifting solution is not affected by magnetic field $B$, if $B\ll
B_{\mathrm{crit}}\approx 10^{17}\,(\nu/600\,\mathrm{Hz})$ G ($\nu$ is a spin
frequency) and does not lead to secular evolution of magnetic field. For
general second order r-mode solution the drift does not necessarily vanish, but
the solution can be presented as a superposition of two solutions: one
describes evolution of differential rotation in nonoscillating star (which
describes secular drift; for nonmagnetized star it is arbitrary stationary
rotation stratified on cylinders; for magnetized star differential rotation
evolves on the Alfv\'{e}n timescale and may lead to magnetic energy
enhancement), and another one is non-drifting r-mode solution mentioned above.
This representation allows us to conclude that enhancement of magnetic field
energy is limited by initial energy of differential rotation, which is much
less (for a factor $\propto \alpha^2$, where $\alpha$ is mode amplitude) than
the total energy of r-mode. Hence, magnetic field enhancement by drift cannot
suppress r-mode instability. Results can be generalized for any oscillation
mode in any medium, if this mode has non-drifting solution for $B=0$.

generalization in which the relationship between $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\beta^*

noninvertible, as well as unknown. This model is known as the single-index
model in statistics, and, among other things, it represents a significant
generalization of one-bit compressed sensing. We propose a novel spectral-based
estimation procedure and show that we can recover $\beta^*$ in settings (i.e.,
classes of link function $f$) where previous algorithms fail. In general, our
algorithm requires only very mild restrictions on the (unknown) functional
relationship between $y_i$ and $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\beta^* \rangle$. We also
consider the high dimensional setting where $\beta^*$ is sparse ,and introduce
a two-stage nonconvex framework that addresses estimation challenges in high
dimensional regimes where $p \gg n$. For a broad class of link functions
between $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\beta^* \rangle$ and $y_i$, we establish minimax
lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our estimators in both the

nonlinear effect, which has attracted great interests in nonlinear optics and
microwave in the past decades. To the best of our knowledge, however,
generating the second harmonics of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) has not
been reported. Here, we propose to generate the second harmonics of spoof SPPs
with high efficiency at microwave frequencies using subwavelength-scale
nonlinear active device integrated on specially designed plasmonic waveguides,
which are composed of two ultrathin corrugated metallic strips printed on the
top and bottom surfaces of a thin dielectric slab anti-symmetrically. We show
that the plasmonic waveguide supports broadband propagations of spoof SPPs with
strong subwavelength effect, whose dispersion property can be controlled by
changing the geometrical parameters. By loading the nonlinear device made from
semiconductors to the intersection of two plasmonic waveguides with different
corrugation depths, we experimentally demonstrate the efficient generation of
second-harmonic SPPs in broad frequency band. The proposed second-harmonic
generator can be directly used as SPP frequency multiplier, and the proposed
method can be extended to achieve high-order harmonics and produce SPP mixers,
which are essential to SPP integrated circuits and systems.

$\mathrm{^{13}C^++CO\rightarrow{}^{13}CO+C^+}$. Moreover, the abundances of the
two $^{13}$C isotopic species are different from each other. The ratio of
c-$\mathrm{^{13}CCCH_2}$ species relative to c-$\mathrm{CC^{13}CH_2}$ is
determined to be $0.20\pm0.05$. If $^{13}$C were randomly substituted for the

number of processes to systems of a determined, fixed size. Our work stems from
the observation that existing cutoff results for guarded protocols i) are
restricted to closed systems, and ii) are of limited use for liveness
properties because reductions do not preserve fairness. We close these gaps and
obtain new cutoff results for open systems with liveness properties under
fairness assumptions. Furthermore, we obtain cutoffs for the detection of

stuck-at memory cells, which is motivated by the behavior of multi-level cells
in non-volatile memories such as flash memories and phase change memories. If a
cell can store the $q$ levels $0, 1, \dots, q-1$, we say that it is partially
stuck-at level $s$, where $1 \leq s \leq q-1$, if it can only store values
which are at least $s$. We follow the common setup where the encoder knows the
positions and levels of the partially stuck-at cells whereas the decoder does
not.
  Our main contribution in the paper is the study of codes for masking $u$
partially stuck-at cells. We first derive lower and upper bounds on the
redundancy of such codes. The upper bounds are based on two trivial
constructions. We then present three code constructions over an alphabet of
size $q$, by first considering the case where the cells are partially stuck-at
level $s=1$. The first construction works for $u<q$ and is asymptotically
optimal if $u+1$ divides $q$. The second construction uses the reduced row
Echelon form of matrices to generate codes for the case $u\geq q$, and the
third construction solves the case of arbitrary $u$ by using codes which mask
binary stuck-at cells. We then show how to generalize all constructions to
arbitrary stuck levels. Furthermore, we study the dual defect model in which
cells cannot reach higher levels, and show that codes for partially stuck-at
cells can be used to mask this type of defects as well. Lastly, we analyze the
capacity of the partially stuck-at memory channel and study how far our
constructions are from the capacity.

by interaction of the cosmic rays with interstellar bodies. The first
spallation reactions induced with an accelerator took place in 1947 at the
Berkeley cyclotron (University of California) with 200 MeV deuterons and 400
MeV alpha beams. They highlighted the multiple emission of neutrons and charged
particles and the production of a large number of residual nuclei far different
from the target nuclei. The same year R. Serber describes the reaction in two
steps: a first and fast one with high-energy particle emission leading to an
excited remnant nucleus, and a second one, much slower, the de-excitation of
the remnant. In 2010 IAEA organized a worskhop to present the results of the
most widely used spallation codes within a benchmark of spallation models. If
one of the goals was to understand the deficiencies, if any, in each code, one
remarkable outcome points out the overall high-quality level of some models and
so the great improvements achieved since Serber. Particle transport codes can
then rely on such spallation models to treat the reactions between a light
particle and an atomic nucleus with energies spanning from few tens of MeV up
to some GeV. An overview of the spallation reactions modeling is presented in
order to point out the incomparable contribution of models based on basic
physics to numerous applications where such reactions occur. Validations or
benchmarks, which are necessary steps in the improvement process, are also
addressed, as well as the potential future domains of development. Spallation
reactions modeling is a representative case of continuous studies aiming at
understanding a reaction mechanism and which end up in a powerful tool.

the $\rho,\rho',\omega,\omega',a_1, b_1,h_1$ and possibly $f_1$ $J=1$ mesons
get degenerate after removal of the quasi-zero modes. This emergent symmetry
has been established to be $SU(4)\supset SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A$.
It is higher than the symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian and provides not only a
mixing of quarks of given chirality in the isospin space, but also the mixing
of left-handed and right-handed components. Here we study, with the Overlap

orbits, even though current binary-evolution theory predicts those objects to
be circularised before the onset of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF). We aim to find
binary-evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long-period
orbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three
different processes are considered; tidally-enhanced wind mass-loss,
phase-dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a
circumbinary disk and the binary. The binary module of the stellar-evolution
code MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) is extended to
include the eccentricity-pumping processes. The effects of different input
parameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are
tested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind
mass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,
and invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite
helium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are
formed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and
could help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity
diagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a
circumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well. A
remaining problem is that these models favour a distribution of higher
eccentricities at lower periods, while the observed systems show the opposite.
The models presented here are potentially capable of explaining the
period-eccentricity distribution of long-period sdB binaries, but further
theoretical work on the physical mechanisms is necessary.

  Ultra-long GRB 130925A","6 Pages, 3 Figures, Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical
  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GRB 130925A is an ultra-long GRB, and it shows clear evidences for a thermal
emission in the soft X-ray data of \emph{Swift}/XRT ($\sim0.5$\,keV), lasting
till the X-ray afterglow phase. Due to the long duration of the GRB, the burst
could be studied in hard X-rays with high-resolution focusing detectors
(\emph{NuSTAR}). The blackbody temperature, as measured by the
\emph{Swift}/XRT, shows a decreasing trend till the late phase (Piro et al.
2014) whereas the high-energy data reveals a significant blackbody component
during the late epochs at an order of magnitude higher temperature
($\sim5$\,keV), as compared to the contemporaneous low energy data (Bellm et
al. 2014). We resolve this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that a model
with two black bodies and a power-law (2BBPL) is consistent with the data right
from the late prompt emission to the afterglow phase. Both the blackbodies show
a similar cooling behaviour upto the late time. We invoke a structured jet,
having a fast spine and a slower sheath layer, to identify the location of
these blackbodies. Independent of the physical interpretation, we propose that
the 2BBPL model is a generic feature of the prompt emission of all long GRBs,
and the thermal emission found in the afterglow phase of different GRBs
reflects the lingering thermal component of the prompt emission with diverse
time-scales. We strengthen this proposal by pointing out a close similarity
between the spectral evolutions of this GRB and GRB~090618, a source with
significant wide band data during the early afterglow phase.

to interpolate between relativistic and non-relativistic NG modes, revealing a
nature of type-I and II NG modes in non-relativistic theories. The
interpolating Lagrangians have the nonlinear Lorentz invariance which reduces
to the Galilei or Schrodinger invariance in the non-relativistic limit. We find
that type-I and type-II NG modes in the interpolating region are accompanied
with a Higgs mode and a chiral NG partner, respectively, both of which are
gapful. In the ultra-relativistic limit, a set of a type-I NG mode and its
Higgs partner remains, while a set of type-II NG mode and gapful NG partner
turns to a set of two type-I NG modes. In the non-relativistic limit, the both
types of accompanied gapful modes become infinitely massive, disappearing from

value in a quantum system, is very important to many key quantum technologies.
Many of these technologies rely on an optical probe, either coherent or
squeezed states to make a precise measurement of a parameter ultimately limited
by quantum mechanics. We use this technique to theoretically model, simulate
and validate by experiment the measurement and precise estimation of the
position of a cavity mirror. In non-resonant systems, the achieved estimation
enhancement from quantum smoothing over optimal filtering has not exceeded a
factor two, even when squeezed state probes were used. Using a coherent state
probe, we show that using quantum smoothing on a mechanically resonant
structure driven by a resonant forcing function can result significantly
greater improvement in parameter estimation than with non-resonant systems. In
this work, we show that it is possible to achieve a smoothing improvement by a
factor in excess of three times over optimal filtering. By using intra-cavity
light as the probe we obtain finer precision than has been achieved with the
equivalent quantum resources in free-space.

white Gaussian noise channel using non-orthogonal pulses. In particular, we
consider non-orthogonal transmission by signaling samples at a rate higher than
the Nyquist rate. Using the faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) framework, Mazo showed
that one may transmit symbols carried by sinc pulses at a higher rate than that
dictated by Nyquist without loosing bit error rate. However, as we will show in
this paper, such pulses are not necessarily well localized in time. In fact,
assuming that signals in the FTN framework are well localized in time, one can
construct a signaling scheme that violates the Shannon capacity bound. We also
show directly that FTN signals are in general not well localized in time.
Therefore, the results of Mazo do not imply that one can transmit more data per
time unit without degrading performance in terms of error probability.
  We also consider FTN signaling in the case of pulses that are different from
the sinc pulses. We show that one can use a precoding scheme of low complexity
to remove the inter-symbol interference. This leads to the possibility of
increasing the number of transmitted samples per time unit and compensate for
spectral inefficiency due to signaling at the Nyquist rate of the non sinc
pulses. We demonstrate the power of the precoding scheme by simulations.

l_p in chemical equilibrium with a solution of free monomers at fixed monomer
chemical potential mu_1 and fixed temperature T. While one end of the filament
is chemically active with single monomer (de)polymerization steps, the other
end is grafted normally to a rigid wall to mimick a rigid network from which
the filament under consideration emerges. A second rigid wall, parallel to the
grafting wall, is fixed at distance L<<l_p from the filament seed. In
supercritical conditions the filament tends to grow and impinges onto the
second surface which, in suitable conditions (non-escaping filament regime)
stops the filament growth. We first establish the grand-potential and derive
some general properties, in particular the filament size distribution and the
force exerted by the living filament on the obstacle wall. We apply this
formalism to the semi-flexible, living, discrete Wormlike chain (d-WLC) model
with step size d and persistence length l_p, hitting a hard wall. By original
Monte-Carlo calculations we justify the use of the weak bending universal
expressions of Gholami et al. (Phys.Rev.E. 74,(2006), 041803) over the whole
non escaping filament regime. Employing this universal form for living
filaments, we find that the average force exerted by a living filament on a
wall at distance L is in practice L independent and very close to the value
predicted by Hill, his expression being strictly valid in the rigid filament
limit. The average filament force results from the product of the cumulative
size fraction x, where the filament is in contact with the wall, times the
buckling force on a filament of size L_c ~ L. We discuss several consequences
of the L independence of the stalling force for our specific filament model.

steps requires that particles possess desired attributes such as size and
shape. Controlling the particle production process to obtain required
attributes will be greatly facilitated using robust algorithms providing the
size and shape information of the particles from in situ measurements. However,
obtaining particle size and shape information in situ during manufacturing has
been a big challenge. This is because the problem of estimating particle size
and shape (aspect ratio) from signals provided by in-line measuring tools is
often ill posed, and therefore it calls for appropriate constraints to be
imposed on the problem. One way to constrain uncertainty in estimation of
particle size and shape from in-line measurements is to combine data from
different measurements such as chord length distribution (CLD) and imaging.
This paper presents two different methods for combining imaging and CLD data
obtained with in-line tools in order to get reliable estimates of particle size
distribution and aspect ratio, where the imaging data is used to constrain the
search space for an aspect ratio from the CLD data.

approach to mobile malware detection is analogous to general practitioner

general practitioner that, based on indicative symptoms identifies potential

system distinguishes among symptoms representing different malware families
and, once the symptoms are detected, it triggers specific analyses. A system
monitoring application operates in the same way as a general practitioner. It
is able to distinguish between different symptoms and trigger appropriate

efficiently by the well known Nakagami${-}q$ or Hoyt distribution and the
proposed analysis is carried out in the context of the area under the receiver

of detection metric, the AUC is a single metric and has been shown to be rather
capable of evaluating the performance of a detector in applications relating to
cognitive radio, radar systems and biomedical engineering, among others. Based
on this, novel analytic expressions are derived for the average AUC and its
complementary metric, average CAUC, for both integer and fractional values of
the involved time-bandwidth product. The derived expressions have a tractable
algebraic representation which renders them convenient to handle both
analytically and numerically. Based on this, they are employed in analyzing the
behavior of energy detection based spectrum sensing over enriched fading
conditions for different severity scenarios, which demonstrates that the
performance of energy detectors is, as expected, closely related to the value
of the fading parameter $q$.

streaming property testers against streaming algorithms and property testers,
when they are not combined. Initiated by Feigenbaum et al., a streaming
property tester is a streaming algorithm recognizing a language under the
property testing approximation: it must distinguish inputs of the language from
those that are $\varepsilon$-far from it, while using the smallest possible
memory (rather than limiting its number of input queries).
  Our main result is a streaming $\varepsilon$-property tester for visibly
pushdown languages (VPL) with one-sided error using memory space
$\mathrm{poly}((\log n) / \varepsilon)$.
  This constructions relies on a (non-streaming) property tester for weighted
regular languages based on a previous tester by Alon et al. We provide a simple
application of this tester for streaming testing special cases of instances of
VPL that are already hard for both streaming algorithms and property testers.
  Our main algorithm is a combination of an original simulation of visibly
pushdown automata using a stack with small height but possible items of linear
size. In a second step, those items are replaced by small sketches. Those
sketches relies on a notion of suffix-sampling we introduce. This sampling is
the key idea connecting our streaming tester algorithm to property testers.

level-crossing method to discrete-time stochastic processes and generalize it
to enable us to study multiple discrete-time stochastic processes. In previous
versions of the level-crossing method, problems with it correspond to the fact
that this method had been developed for analyzing a continuous-time process or
at most a multiple continuous-time process in an individual manner. However,
since all empirical processes are discrete in time, the already-established
level-crossing method may not prove adequate for studying empirical processes.
Beyond this, due to the fact that most empirical processes are coupled; their
individual study could lead to vague results. To achieve the objectives of this
study, we first find an analytical expression for the average frequency of
crossing a level in a discrete-time process, giving the measure of the time
experienced for two consecutive crossings named as the ""waiting time"". We then
introduce the generalized level-crossing method by which the consideration of
coupling between the components of a multiple process becomes possible.
Finally, we provide an analytic solution when the components of a multiple
stochastic process are independent Gaussian white noises. The comparison of the

corona. Wavefront dislocations are topological features of most waves in nature
and also of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Are there dislocations in coronal waves?
The finding and explanation of dislocations may shed light on the nature and
characteristics of the propagating waves, their interaction in the corona and
in general on the plasma dynamics. We positively identify dislocations in
coronal waves observed by the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) as
singularities in the Doppler shifts of emission coronal lines. We study the
possible singularities that can be expected in coronal waves and try to
reproduce the observed dislocations in terms of localization and frequency of
appearance. The observed dislocations can only be explained by the interference
of a kink and a sausage wave modes propagating with different frequencies along
the coronal magnetic field. In the plane transverse to the propagation, the
cross-section of the oscillating plasma must be smaller than the spatial
resolution, and the two waves result in net longitudinal and transverse
velocity components that are mixed through projection onto the line of sight.
Alfv\'en waves can be responsible of the kink mode, but a magnetoacoustic
sausage mode is necessary in all cases. Higher (flute) modes are excluded. The
kink mode has a pressure amplitude that is smaller than the pressure amplitude
of the sausage mode, though its observed velocity is larger. This concentrates
dislocations on the top of the loop. To explain dislocations, any model of
coronal waves must include the simultaneous propagation and interference of
kink and sausage wave modes of comparable but different frequencies, with a
sausage wave amplitude much smaller than the kink one.

Bayesian inference when the likelihood function is computationally intractable.
In practice, the basic ABC algorithm may be inefficient in the presence of
discrepancy between prior and posterior. Therefore, more elaborate methods,
such as ABC with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (ABC-MCMC), should be
used. However, the elaboration of a proposal density for MCMC is a sensitive
issue and very difficult in the ABC setting, where the likelihood is
intractable. We discuss an automatic proposal distribution useful for ABC-MCMC
algorithms. This proposal is inspired by the theory of quasi-likelihood (QL)
functions and is obtained by modelling the distribution of the summary
statistics as a function of the parameters. Essentially, given a real-valued
vector of summary statistics, we reparametrize the model by means of a
regression function of the statistics on parameters, obtained by sampling from
the original model in a pilot-run simulation study. The QL theory is well
established for a scalar parameter, and it is shown that when the conditional
variance of the summary statistic is assumed constant, the QL has a closed-form
normal density. This idea of constructing proposal distributions is extended to
non constant variance and to real-valued parameter vectors. The method is
illustrated by several examples and by an application to a real problem in
population genetics.

difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. Here we carefully examine some
commonly used moment closures, in particular a new one based on the concept of
maximum entropy, for approximating the spread of epidemics on networks by
reconstructing the probability distributions over triplets based on those over
pairs. We consider various models (SI, SIR, SEIR and Reed-Frost-type) under
Markovian and non-Markovian assumption characterising the latent and infectious
periods. We initially study two special networks, namely the open triplet and
closed triangle, for which we can obtain analytical results. We then explore
numerically the exactness of moment closures for a wide range of larger motifs,
thus gaining understanding of the factors that introduce errors in the
approximations, in particular the presence of a random duration of the
infectious period and the presence of overlapping triangles in a network. We
also derive a simpler and more intuitive proof than previously available
concerning the known result that pair-based moment closure is exact for the
Markovian SIR model on tree-like networks under pure initial conditions. We
also extend such a result to all infectious models, Markovian and
non-Markovian, in which susceptibles escape infection independently from each
infected neighbour and for which infectives cannot regain susceptible status,
provided the network is tree-like and initial conditions are pure. This works
represent a valuable step in deepening understanding of the assumptions behind

the local orientation of facets relative to each cell in the mesh is consistent

detecting adverse drug reactions. However, due to their dimension, exploring
such databases requires statistical methods. In this context,
disproportionality measures are used. However, by projecting the data onto
contingency tables, these methods become sensitive to the problem of
co-prescriptions and masking effects. Recently, logistic regressions have been
used with a Lasso type penalty to perform the detection of associations between
drugs and adverse events. However, the choice of the penalty value is open to
criticism while it strongly influences the results. Results: In this paper, we
propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is viewed as a model
selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion.
Thus, we avoid the calibration of penalty or threshold. During our application
on the French pharmacovigilance database, the proposed method is compared to
well established approaches on a reference data set, and obtains better rates
of positive and negative controls. However, many signals are not detected by
the proposed method. So, we conclude that this method should be used in
parallel to existing measures in pharmacovigilance.

flow structures near solid boundaries. On the other hand, they tend to be
diffusive and to dampen high-intensity vortical structures after a short
distance away from solid boundaries. The use of high order methods and fine
grids, although alleviating this problem, gives rise to large systems of
equations that are expensive to solve.
  Lagrangian solvers, as the regularized vortex particle method, have shown to
eliminate (in practice) the diffusion in the wake. As a drawback, the modelling
of solid boundaries is less accurate, more complex and costly than with
Eulerian solvers (due to the isotropy of its computational elements).
  Given the drawbacks and advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers
the combination of both methods, giving rise to a hybrid solver, is
advantageous. The main idea behind the hybrid solver presented is the
following. In a region close to solid boundaries the flow is solved with an
Eulerian solver, where the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved (possibly
with an arbitrary turbulence model or DNS, the limitations being the
computational power and the physical properties of the flow), outside of that
region the flow is solved with a vortex particle method.
  In this work we present this hybrid scheme and verify it numerically on known
2D benchmark cases: dipole flow, flow around a cylinder and flow around a
stalled airfoil. The success in modelling these flow conditions presents this
hybrid approach as a promising alternative, bridging the gap between highly
resolved and computationally intensive Eulerian CFD simulations and fast but
less resolved Lagrangian simulations.

fraction of its mass may be ejected. If the time varying gravitational field
also breaks spherical symmetry this mass can potentially carry angular
momentum. Thus starting initial configurations with zero angular momentum can
in principle lead to a bound virialized system with non-zero angular momentum.
We explore here, using numerical simulations, how much angular momentum can be
generated in a virialized structure in this way, starting from configurations
of cold particles which are very close to spherically symmetric. For initial
configurations in which spherical symmetry is broken only by the Poissonian
fluctuations associated with the finite particle number $N$, with $N$ in range
$10^3$ to $10^5$, we find that the relaxed structures have standard ""spin""
parameters $\lambda \sim 10^{-3}$, and decreasing slowly with $N$. For slightly
ellipsoidal initial conditions, in which the finite-$N$ fluctuations break the
residual reflection symmetries, we observe values $\lambda \sim 10^{-2}$, of
the same order of magnitude as those reported for elliptical galaxies. The net
angular momentum vector is typically aligned close to normal to the major
semi-axis of the triaxial relaxed structure, and also with that of the ejected
mass. This simple mechanism may provide an alternative, or complement, to
""tidal torque theory"" for understanding the origin of angular momentum in

using ideas from II. Another approach proposed in the literature, referred to
here as parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL), uses the auxiliary
likelihood as a replacement to the intractable likelihood. We show that pBIL is
a fundamentally different approach to ABC II. We devise new theoretical results
for pBIL to give extra insights into its behaviour and also its differences
with ABC II. Furthermore, we examine in more detail the assumptions required to
use each pBII method. The results, insights and comparisons developed in this
paper are illustrated on simple examples and two other substantive
applications. The first of the substantive examples involves performing
inference for complex quantile distributions based on simulated data while the
second is for estimating the parameters of a trivariate stochastic process
describing the evolution of macroparasites within a host based on real data. We
create a novel framework called Bayesian indirect likelihood (BIL) that
encompasses pBII as well as general ABC methods so that the connections between
the methods can be established.

non-canonical kinetic term with a pole, and a potential analytic around the

the functional form that corresponds to quasi-scale invariant gravitational

classical scale-invariance in the Jordan frame can be attributed to one-loop

regions of thermal emission due to embedded protoplanets, further theoretical
predictions are needed to understand the response of a protoplanetary disk to
the planet formation radiative feedback. This is particularly important to make
predictions for the observability of circumplanetary regions. In this work we
use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to examine the evolution of a viscous
protoplanetary disk in which a luminous Jupiter-mass planet is embedded. We use
an energy equation which includes the radiative heating of the planet as an
additional mechanism for planet formation feedback. Several models are computed
for planet luminosities ranging from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$ Solar luminosities.
We find that the planet radiative feedback enhances the disk's accretion rate
at the planet's orbital radius, producing a hotter and more luminous
environement around the planet, independently of the prescription used to model
the disk's turbulent viscosity. We also estimate the thermal signature of the
planet feedback for our range of planet luminosities, finding that the emitted
spectrum of a purely active disk, without passive heating, is appreciably
modified in the infrared. We simulate the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546
where a planet companion is located at about 68 au from the star. Assuming the
planet mass is 5 Jupiter masses and its luminosity is $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-4}
\, L_\odot$, we find that the radiative feedback of the planet increases the
luminosity of its $\sim 5$ au circumplanetary disk from $10^{-5} \, \rm
L_\odot$ (without feedback) to $10^{-3} \, \rm L_\odot$, corresponding to an
emission of $\sim 1 \, \rm mJy$ in $L^\prime$ band after radiative transfer
calculations, a value that is in good agreement with HD 100546b observations.

resolved, with the majority showing core-jet morphology typical for radio-loud
quasars. We discuss in details the most interesting cases. The high radio
luminosities and small linear sizes of the observed objects indicate they are
strong young AGNs. Nevertheless, the distribution of the radio-loudness
parameter, log(Ri), of a larger sample of AI quasars shows that the objects
observed by us constitute the most luminous, small subgroup of AI population.
Additionally we report that for the radio-loudness parameter, the distribution
of AI quasars and those selected by using the traditional balnicity index (BI),
BI quasars differ significantly. Strong absorption is connected with the lower
log(Ri), and thus probably with larger viewing angles. Since, the AI quasars
have on average larger log(Ri), the orientation can cause that we see them less
absorbed. However, we suggest that the orientation is not the only parameter
that affects the detected absorption. The fact that the strong absorption is

ill-posed. In practice, subspace or sparsity constraints have been imposed to
reduce the search space, and have shown some empirical success. However,
existing theoretical analysis on uniqueness in BD is rather limited. As an
effort to address the still mysterious question, we derive sufficient
conditions under which two vectors can be uniquely identified from their
circular convolution, subject to subspace or sparsity constraints. These
sufficient conditions provide the first algebraic sample complexities for BD.
We first derive a sufficient condition that applies to almost all bases or
frames. For blind deconvolution of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$, with two subspace
constraints of dimensions $m_1$ and $m_2$, the required sample complexity is
$n\geq m_1m_2$. Then we impose a sub-band structure on one basis, and derive a
sufficient condition that involves a relaxed sample complexity $n\geq
m_1+m_2-1$, which we show to be optimal. We present the extensions of these
results to BD with sparsity constraints or mixed constraints, with the sparsity
level replacing the subspace dimension. The cost for the unknown support in

($M_V=-12.2$) which has a relatively high probability of being a chance
alignment. A faint, red, point source coincident with the fourth SN Ia's
explosion position ($M_V=-8.4$) may be either a globular cluster (GC) or faint

that a GC is more likely, due to the proximity of an elliptical galaxy, but
neither can be ruled out. This faint host implies that the SN Ia rate in dwarfs
or GCs may be enhanced, but remains within previous observational constraints.
We demonstrate that our results do not preclude the use of SNe Ia as bright
tracers of intracluster light at higher redshifts, but that it will be
necessary to first refine the constraints on their rate in dwarfs and GCs with
deep imaging for a larger sample of low-redshift, apparently hostless SNe Ia.

Besides the
intrinsic X-ray emission of individual binary members originating in their
winds, X-ray emission stems from the accretion on the compact companion or from
wind collision. Since hot star winds are driven by the light absorption in the
lines of heavier elements, wind acceleration is sensitive to the ionization
state. Therefore, the over-ionization induced by external X-ray source strongly
influences the winds of individual components. We studied the effect of
external X-ray irradiation on hot star winds. We used our kinetic equilibrium
(NLTE) wind models to estimate the influence of external X-ray ionization for
different X-ray luminosities and source distances. The models are calculated
for parameters typical of O stars. The influence of X-rays is given by the
X-ray luminosity, by the optical depth between a given point and the X-ray
source, and by a distance to the X-ray source. Therefore, the results can be
interpreted in the diagrams of X-ray luminosity vs.~the optical depth
parameter. X-rays are negligible in binaries with low X-ray luminosities or at
large distances from the X-ray source. The influence of X-rays is stronger for
higher X-ray luminosities and in closer proximity of the X-ray source. There is
a forbidden area with high X-ray luminosities and low optical depth parameters,
where the X-ray ionization leads to wind inhibition. There is excellent
agreement between the positions of observed stars in these diagrams and our
predictions. All wind-powered high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) primaries lie
outside the forbidden area. Many of them lie close to the border of the
forbidden area, indicating that their X-ray luminosities are self-regulated. We
discuss the implications of our work for other binary types.

Standard Model (SM). Recently, promising experiments with \textit{b} quark, as
well as the analysis of the huge data sets produced at the B factories, have
led to an increasing study and sensitive measurements of relative \textit{b}
quark decays. In this thesis, I calculate various observables in the
semi-leptonic decay process $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda_{c}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$
both in the SM and in the presence of New Physics (NP) operators with different
Lorentz structures. The results are relevant for the coming measurement of this
semi-leptonic decay at LHC \textit{b} experiment in CERN, and also provide
theoretical predictions to refine the physics beyond the SM.

which has been widely studied with several mathematical models. The main
question is to define the fittest dispersal rate for a population in a bounded
domain, and, more recently, for traveling waves in the full space.
  In the present study, we reformulate the problem in the context of adaptive
evolution. We consider a population structured by space and a genetic trait
acting directly on the dispersal (diffusion) rate under the effect of rare
mutations on the genetic trait. We show that, as in simpler models, in the
limit of vanishing mutations, the population concentrates on a single trait
associated to the lowest dispersal rate. We also explain how to compute the
evolution speed towards this evolutionary stable distribution.
  The mathematical interest stems from the asymptotic analysis which requires a
completely different treatment of the different variables. For the space
variable, the ellipticity leads to the use the maximum principle and
Sobolev-type regularity results. For the trait variable, the concentration to a
Dirac mass requires a different treatment. This is based on the WKB method and
viscosity solutions leading to an effective Hamiltonian (effective fitness of
the population) and a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

  In this paper we introduce Time4, an approach that uses accurate time to
coordinate network updates. Time4 is a powerful tool in softwarized
environments, that can be used for various network update scenarios.
Specifically, we characterize a set of update scenarios called flow swaps, for
which Time4 is the optimal update approach, yielding less packet loss than
existing update approaches. We define the lossless flow allocation problem, and
formally show that in environments with frequent path allocation, scenarios
that require simultaneous changes at multiple network devices are inevitable.
  We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Time4-enabled
OpenFlow prototype. The prototype is publicly available as open source. Our
work includes an extension to the OpenFlow protocol that has been adopted by
the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), and is now included in OpenFlow 1.5. Our
experimental results show the significant advantages of Time4 compared to other
network update approaches, and demonstrate an SDN use case that is infeasible

from pairwise relative measurements. PGO is a nonconvex problem, and currently
no known technique can guarantee the computation of an optimal solution. In
this paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal
solution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases.
Our first contribution is to frame the PGO problem in the complex domain. This
makes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature
on unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results
about the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second
contribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex
domain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of
eigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution
of the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then
(i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal PGO problem has a unique solution,
and (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the
penalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit
the dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal
solution for PGO when the penalized pose graph matrix satisfies the Single Zero
Eigenvalue Property (SZEP). We also propose a variant that deals with the case
in which the SZEP is not satisfied. The fourth contribution is a numerical
analysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100% of
the tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized
pose graph matrix does satisfy the SZEP, hence our approach allows computing
the global optimal solution. Finally, we report simple counterexamples in which
the duality gap is nonzero, and discuss open problems.

recently we presented a solution of the Schr\""odinger equation for spin-$1/2$

Redfield theory follows directly from the Schr\""odinger equation solution. This
serves to highlight the conditions of validity of the Redfield theory, a
subject of considerable discussion in the literature [e.g., Nicholas et al.]
Our results can be applied where the Redfield result no longer holds, such as
observation times on the order of or shorter than the correlation time and
non-stochastic systems and thus we can illustrate the transient spin dynamics,
i.e. the gradual development of the shift with increasing time subsequent to
the start of the free precession. We consider systems with rough, diffuse
reflecting walls, cylindrical trap geometry with arbitrary cross section, and
field perturbations that do not, in the frame of the moving particles, average
to zero in time. We show by direct, detailed, calculation the agreement of the

oscillator attached to the massless spring are always discussed in general
mechanics courses. In this article, we focus on the heavy-spring conditions. We
first investigate the general situation where both viscous resistance and
applied force are considered under the perspective of the renormalization group
theory. Then we deal with the special case where renormalization method fails
to work. We use analytic method to study the evanescent vibration of an
oscillator attached to the heavy spring. Generalized orthogonal and
over-complete base set is established. Two independent vibration modes indicate
the vibrational frequency becomes bigger than simple harmonic oscillator if the
mass of spring is considered.

the Subaru-XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) using deep imaging data covering the
wavelength range between the far-UV to the mid-IR. We select a primary
counterpart of each X-ray source by applying the likelihood ratio method to
R-band, 3.6micron, near-UV, and 24micron source catalogs as well as matching
catalogs of AGN candidates selected in 1.4GHz radio and i'-band variability
surveys. Once candidates of Galactic stars, ultra-luminous X-ray sources in a
nearby galaxy, and clusters of galaxies are removed there are 896 AGN
candidates in the sample. We conduct spectroscopic observations of the primary
counterparts with multi-object spectrographs in the optical and NIR; 65\% of
the X-ray AGN candidates are spectroscopically-identified. For the remaining
X-ray AGN candidates, we evaluate their photometric redshift with photometric
data in 15 bands. Utilising the multi-wavelength photometric data of the large
sample of X-ray selected AGNs, we evaluate the stellar masses, M*, of the host
galaxies of the narrow-line AGNs. The distribution of the stellar mass is
remarkably constant from z=0.1 to 4.0. The relation between M* and 2--10 keV
luminosity can be explained with strong cosmological evolution of the
relationship between the black hole mass and M*. We also evaluate the scatter
of the UV-MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) of the X-ray AGNs as a
function of X-ray luminosity and absorption to the nucleus. The scatter is
compared with galaxies which have redshift and stellar mass distribution
matched with the X-ray AGN. The UV-NIR SEDs of obscured X-ray AGNs are similar
to those of the galaxies in the matched sample. In the NIR-MIR range, the
median SEDs of X-ray AGNs are redder, but the scatter of the SEDs of the X-ray
AGN broadly overlaps that of the galaxies in the matched sample.

diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian matrix.Comparisons are made with other
