flavors produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The in-medium energy
loss of heavy quarks is described using our modified Langevin equation that
incorporates both quasi-elastic scatterings and the medium-induced gluon
radiation. The space-time profiles of the fireball is described by a
(2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics simulation. A hybrid model of fragmentation and
coalescence is utilized for heavy quark hadronization, after which the produced
heavy mesons together with the soft hadrons produced from the bulk QGP are fed
into the hadron cascade UrQMD model to simulate the subsequent hadronic
interactions. We find that the medium-induced gluon radiation contributes
significantly to heavy quark energy loss at high $p_\mathrm{T}$; heavy-light
quark coalescence enhances heavy meson production at intermediate
$p_\mathrm{T}$; and scatterings inside the hadron gas further suppress the $D$
meson $R_\mathrm{AA}$ at large $p_\mathrm{T}$ and enhance its $v_2$. Our
calculations provide good descriptions of heavy meson suppression and elliptic
flow observed at both the LHC and RHIC.

gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) still remain unclear. Observational evidence provides
support to the idea that SGRBs originate from the merger of compact binaries,
consisting of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH).
Theoretical models and numerical simulations seem to converge to an explanation
in which the central engine of SGRBs is given by a spinning BH surrounded by a
hot accretion torus. Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary
mergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the
SGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift
satellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in
association with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these
afterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the
$\sim\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,
suggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation. Yet, if the
merger results in a massive NS the conditions to generate a relativistic jet
and thus the prompt SGRB emission are hardly met. Here we consider an
alternative scenario that can reconcile the two aspects and account for both
the prompt and the X-ray afterglow emission. Implications for future
observations, multi-messenger astronomy and for constraining NS properties are
discussed, as well as potential challenges for the model.

different conditions than those usually assumed for dipole spin-down emission
in the magnetar model. In particular, the surrounding of the newly formed NS is
polluted by baryons due to a dense, highly magnetized and isotropic wind from
the stellar surface that is induced by magnetic field amplification in the
interior of the star. The timescales and luminosities of this wind are
compatible with early X-ray afterglows, such as the ""extended emission"". These
isotropic winds are a generic feature of BNS merger remnants and thus represent
an attractive alternative to current models of early X-ray afterglows. Further
implications to BNS mergers and short gamma-ray bursts are discussed.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars towards the Galactic bulge is presented.
The sample consists of two subsamples, a larger one in the inner and
intermediate bulge, and a smaller one in the outer bulge. The data are analysed
with the help of hydrostatic model atmospheres and spectral synthesis. We
derive the radial velocity of all stars, and the atmospheric chemical mix
([Fe/H], C/O, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, Al, Si, Ti, and Y) where possible. Our ability
to model the spectra is mainly limited by the (in)completeness of atomic and
molecular line lists, at least for temperatures down to $T_{\rm
eff}\approx3100$ K. We find that the subsample in the inner and intermediate
bulge is quite homogeneous, with a slightly sub-solar mean metallicity and only
few stars with super-solar metallicity, in agreement with previous studies of
non-variable M-type giants in the bulge. All sample stars are oxygen-rich,
C/O$<$1.0. The C/O and carbon isotopic ratios suggest that third dredge-up
(3DUP) is absent among the sample stars, except for two stars in the outer
bulge that are known to contain technetium. These stars are also more
metal-poor than the stars in the intermediate or inner bulge. Current stellar
masses are determined from linear pulsation models. The masses, metallicities
and 3DUP behaviour are compared to AGB evolutionary models. We conclude that
these models are partly in conflict with our observations. Furthermore, we
conclude that the stars in the inner and intermediate bulge belong to a more
metal-rich population that follows bar-like kinematics, whereas the stars in
the outer bulge belong to the metal-poor, spheroidal bulge population.

scattering, which is commonly referred to as Elliott-Yafet (EY) spin-relaxation
mechanism. For this mechanism one usually distinguishes two contributions: (1)
from the electrostatic interaction together with spin-mixing in the wave
functions, which is often called the Elliott contribution, and (2) the
phonon-modulated spin-orbit interaction, which is often called the Yafet or
Overhauser contribution. By computing the reduced electronic density matrix, we
improve Yafet's original calculation, which is not valid for pronounced spin
mixing as it equates the pseudo-spin polarization with the spin polarization.
The important novel quantity in our calculation is a torque operator that
determines the spin dynamics. The contribution (1) to this torque vanishes
exactly. From this general result, we derive a modified expression for the
Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation time.

posterior distribution of hidden trajectory of a Markov jump process. Our
algorithm is based on the idea of exploiting virtual jumps, introduced by Rao
and Teh (2013). The main novelty is that our algorithm uses particle Gibbs with
ancestor sampling to update the skeleton, while Rao and Teh use forward
filtering backward sampling (FFBS). In contrast to previous methods our
algorithm can be implemented even if the state space is infinite. In addition,
the cost of a single step of the proposed algorithm does not depend on the size
of the state space. The computational cost of our methood is of order
$\mathcal{O}(N\mathbb{E}(n))$, where $N$ is the number of particles used in the
PGAS algorithm and $\mathbb{E}(n)$ is the expected number of jumps (together
with virtual ones). The cost of the algorithm of Rao and Teh is of order
$\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{X}|^2\mathbb{E}(n))$, where $|\mathcal{X}|$ is the size
of the state space. Simulation results show that our algorithm with PGAS
converges slightly slower than the algorithm with FFBS, if the size of the
state space is not big. However, if the size of the state space increases, the
proposed method outperforms existing ones. We give special attention to a
hierarchical version of our algorithm which can be applied to continuous time
Bayesian networks (CTBNs).

Time Quantum Random Walk. A form of the Hamiltonian for one dimensional quantum
walk has been prescribed, utilizing the fact that Hamiltonians are the

the techniques to higher dimensions. We find that the Hamiltonian can be
written as the sum of a Weyl Hamiltonian and a Dirac comb potential. The time
evolution operator obtained from this prescribed Hamiltonian is in complete
agreement with that of the standard approach. But in higher dimension we find
that the time evolution operator is additive, instead of being multiplicative
\cite{Chandrasekhar:2013SREP08229}. We showed that in case of two-step walk,
effectively the time evolution operator can have multiplicative form. In case
of a square lattice, quantum walk has been studied computationally for
different coins and the results for both the additive and the multiplicative
approaches have been compared. Using the Graphene Hamiltonian the walk has been
studied on a Graphene lattice and we conclude the preference of additive
approach over the multiplicative one.

is clear that the strong covalency and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) suppress
double exchange in Ir dimers and stabilize a novel magnetic state. The behavior

by applications in kidney exchange and online dating. We are given an
undirected graph in which every edge is assigned a probability of existence and
a positive profit, and each node is assigned a positive integer called timeout.
We know whether an edge exists or not only after probing it. On this random
graph we are executing a process, which one-by-one probes the edges and
gradually constructs a matching. The process is constrained in two ways: once
an edge is taken it cannot be removed from the matching, and the timeout of
node $v$ upper-bounds the number of edges incident to $v$ that can be probed.
The goal is to maximize the expected profit of the constructed matching.
  For this problem Bansal et al. (Algorithmica 2012) provided a
$3$-approximation algorithm for bipartite graphs, and a $4$-approximation for
general graphs. In this work we improve the approximation factors to $2.845$
and $3.709$, respectively.
  We also consider an online version of the bipartite case, where one side of
the partition arrives node by node, and each time a node $b$ arrives we have to
decide which edges incident to $b$ we want to probe, and in which order. Here
we present a $4.07$-approximation, improving on the $7.92$-approximation of
Bansal et al.
  The main technical ingredient in our result is a novel way of probing edges
according to a random but non-uniform permutation. Patching this method with an
algorithm that works best for large probability edges (plus some additional
ideas) leads to our improved approximation factors.

directed feedback from the last element in the chain to the first. The problem
is closely related to the fundamental question of how a change in network
topology may influence the behavior of coupled systems. We begin the analysis
by investigating a simple linear system. The matrix that specifies the system
dynamics is the transpose of the network Laplacian matrix, which codes the
connectivity of the network. Our analysis shows that for any nonzero complex
eigenvalue $\lambda$ of this matrix, the following inequality holds:
$\frac{|\Im \lambda |}{|\Re \lambda |} \leq \cot\frac{\pi}{n}$. This bound is
sharp, as it becomes an equality for an eigenvalue of a simple directed cycle
with uniform interaction weights. The latter has the slowest decay of
oscillations among all other network configurations with the same number of
states. The result is generalized to directed rings and chains of identical
nonlinear oscillators. For directed rings, a lower bound $\sigma_c$ for the
connection strengths that guarantees asymptotic synchronization is found to
follow a similar pattern: $\sigma_c=\frac{1}{1-\cos\left( 2\pi /n\right)} $.
Numerical analysis revealed that, depending on the network size $n$, multiple
dynamic regimes co-exist in the state space of the system. In addition to the
fully synchronous state a rotating wave solution occurs. The effect is observed
in networks exceeding a certain critical size. The emergence of a rotating wave
highlights the importance of long chains and loops in networks of oscillators:
the larger the size of chains and loops, the more sensitive the network
dynamics becomes to removal or addition of a single connection.

the TS into the North and South directions to form two collimated jets. The
radii of these jets are controlled by the flow through the TS and the
acceleration of this flow by the magnetic field -- a stronger solar magnetic
field boosts the velocity of the jets and reduces the radii of the jets and the
HP. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the global helioshere embedded in
a stationary interstellar medium match well with the analytic model. The
results suggest that mechanisms that reduce the HS plasma pressure downstream
of the TS can enhance the jet outflow velocity and reduce the HP radius to
values more consistent with the Voyager 1 observations than in current global
models.

classes. An extensive review of abiotic chemical reactions producing
nucleobases is then performed. These reactions are then reduced to a list of 15
individual reaction pathways that could potentially occur within meteorite
parent bodies. The nucleobases guanine, adenine and uracil are found in
carbonaceous chondrites in the amounts of 1$-$500 ppb. It is currently unknown
which reaction is responsible for their synthesis within the meteorite parent
bodies. One class of carbonaceous meteorites dominate the abundances of both
amino acids and nucleobases$-$the so-called CM2 (e.g. Murchison meteorite). CR2
meteorites (e.g. Graves Nunataks) also dominate the abundances of amino acids,
but are the least abundant in nucleobases. The abundances of total nucleobases
in these two classes are $330 \pm250$ ppb and $16 \pm13$ ppb respectively.
Guanine most often has the greatest abundances in carbonaceous chondrites with

survey of the reaction mechanisms for nucleobase formation suggests that
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (i.e. CO, H$_2$ and NH$_3$ gases reacting in the

the Wigner function of a coherent state is a product of two independent
distributions as if the orthogonal quadratures (position and momentum) in phase
space behave as local realistic variables. Our method detects every pure
nonclassical Gaussian state, which can also be extended to mixed states.
Furthermore, it sets a bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures,
thereby providing a criterion to detect a genuine quantum non-Gaussian state.
Remarkably, our phase-space approach with invariance under Gaussian unitary
operations leads to an optimized test for a given non-Gaussian state. We
experimentally show how this enhanced method can manifest quantum
non-Gaussianity of a state by simply choosing phase-space points appropriately,
which is essentially equivalent to implementing a squeezing operation on a

valuable experience gained by the system is lost from one problem to the next,
even when the problems are closely related. With the aim of developing a system
which retains beneficial experience from problem to problem, this paper
introduces the novel Node-by-Node Growth Solver (NNGS) algorithm which features
a component, called the controller, which can be adapted and improved for use
across a set of related problems. NNGS grows a single solution tree from root
to leaves. Using semantic backpropagation and acting locally on each node in
turn, the algorithm employs the controller to assign subsequent child nodes
until a fully formed solution is generated.
  The aim of this paper is to pave a path towards the use of a neural network
as the controller component and also, separately, towards the use of meta-GP as
a mechanism for improving the controller component. A proof-of-concept
controller is discussed which demonstrates the success and potential of the
NNGS algorithm. In this case, the controller constitutes a set of hand written
rules which can be used to deterministically and greedily solve standard
Boolean function synthesis benchmarks. Even before employing machine learning
to improve the controller, the algorithm vastly outperforms other well known
recent algorithms on run times, maintains comparable solution sizes, and has a
100% success rate on all Boolean function synthesis benchmarks tested so far.

producing the most prominent substructure in the Milky Way (MW) halo, the
Sagittarius Stream. Aside from field stars, the Sgr dSph is suspected to have
lost a number of globular clusters (GC). Many Galactic GC are suspected to have
originated in the Sgr dSph. While for some candidates an origin in the Sgr dSph
has been confirmed due to chemical similarities, others exist whose chemical
composition has never been investigated. NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 are two among
these scarcely studied Sgr dSph candidate-member clusters. To characterize
their composition we analyzed one giant star in NGC 5053, and two in NGC 5634.
We analize high-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra by means of the MyGIsFOS
code, determining atmospheric parameters and abundances for up to 21 species
between O and Eu. The abundances are compared with those of MW halo field
stars, of ""unassociated"" MW halo globulars, and of the metal poor Sgr dSph main
body population.
  We derive a metallicity of [FeII/H]=-2.26+-0.10 for NGC 5053, and of
[FeI/H]=-1.99+-0.075 and -1.97+-0.076 for the two stars in NGC 5634. This makes
NGC 5053 one of the most metal poor globular clusters in the MW. Both clusters
display an alpha enhancement similar to the one of the halo at comparable
metallicity. The two stars in NGC 5634 clearly display the Na-O anticorrelation
widespread among MW globulars. Most other abundances are in good agreement with
standard MW halo trends. The chemistry of the Sgr dSph main body populations is
similar to the one of the halo at low metallicity. It is thus difficult to
discriminate between an origin of NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 in the Sgr dSph, and
one in the MW. However, the abundances of these clusters do appear closer to
that of Sgr dSph than of the halo, favoring an origin in the Sgr dSph system.

galaxy through merging two equal-mass, gas-rich disk galaxies fuelling a
nuclear starburst followed by efficient quenching and dynamical stabilization.
A key prediction of this scenario is a central concentration of young stars
during the brief phase of morphological transformation from highly-disturbed
remnant to new elliptical galaxy. To test this aspect of the merger hypothesis,
we use integral field spectroscopy to track the stellar Balmer absorption and
4000\AA\ break strength indices as a function of galactic radius for 12 massive
(${\rm M_{*}}\ge10^{10}{\rm M_{\odot}}$), nearby (${\rm z}\le0.03$),
visually-selected plausible new ellipticals with blue-cloud optical colours and
varying degrees of morphological peculiarities. We find that these index values
and their radial dependence correlate with specific morphological features such
that the most disturbed galaxies have the smallest 4000\AA\ break strengths and
the largest Balmer absorption values. Overall, two-thirds of our sample are
inconsistent with the predictions of the modern merger hypothesis. Of these
eight, half exhibit signatures consistent with recent minor merger
interactions. The other half have star formation histories similar to local,
quiescent early-type galaxies. Of the remaining four galaxies, three have the
strong morphological disturbances and star-forming optical colours consistent
with being remnants of recent, gas-rich major mergers, but exhibit a weak,
central burst consistent with forming $\sim5\%$ of their stars. The final
galaxy possesses spectroscopic signatures of a strong, centrally-concentrated
starburst and quiescent core optical colours indicative of recent quenching
(i.e., a post-starburst signature) as prescribed by the modern merger
hypothesis.

spectroscopy of 13 ultracool (>M6) companions to late-type stars (K7-M4.5),
most of which have recently been identified as candidate members of nearby
young moving groups (YMGs; 8-120 Myr) in the literature. The inferred masses of
the companions (~10-100 Mjup) are highly sensitive to the ages of the primary
stars so we critically examine the kinematic and spectroscopic properties of
each system to distinguish bona fide YMG members from old field interlopers.
2MASS J02155892-0929121 C is a new M7 substellar companion (40-60 Mjup) with
clear spectroscopic signs of low gravity and hence youth. The primary, possibly
a member of the ~40 Myr Tuc-Hor moving group, is visually resolved into three
components, making it a young low-mass quadruple system in a compact (<100 AU)
configuration. In addition, Li 1 $\lambda$6708 absorption in the
intermediate-gravity M7.5 companion 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B provides
unambiguous evidence that it is young (<200 Myr) and resides below the hydrogen
burning limit. Three new close-separation (<1"") companions (2MASS
J06475229-2523304 B, PYC J11519+0731 B, and GJ 4378 Ab) orbit stars previously
reported as candidate YMG members, but instead are likely old (>1 Gyr)
tidally-locked spectroscopic binaries without convincing kinematic associations
with any known moving group. The high rate of false positives in the form of
old active stars with YMG-like kinematics underscores the importance of radial
velocity and parallax measurements to validate candidate young stars identified

a new near-infrared J, H, K monitoring survey of almost a square degree of the

observing seasons, spanning a total of 894 days. We monitored ~15,000 stars
down to J=20 using the WFCAM instrument, and have extracted 1203 significantly
variable stars from our data. By studying variability in young stellar objects
(YSOs) in the H-K, K color-magnitude diagram, we are able to distinguish
between physical mechanisms of variability. Many variables show color behavior
indicating either dust-extinction or disk/accretion activity, but we find that
when monitored for longer periods of time, a number of stars shift between
these two variability mechanisms. Further, we show that the intrinsic timescale
of disk/accretion variability in young stars is longer than that of
dust-extinction variability. We confirm that variability amplitude is
statistically correlated with evolutionary class in all bands and colors. Our
investigations of these 1203 variables have revealed 73 periodic AA Tau type
variables, many large-amplitude and long-period (P > 15 day) YSOs, including
three stars showing widely-spaced periodic brightening events consistent with
circumbinary disk activity, and four new eclipsing binaries. These phenomena
and others indicate the activity of long-term disk/accretion variability
processes taking place in young stars. We have made the light curves and

further by accretion from the flowing gas, producing conditions favourable to
star formation.

incorporated into the GRMHD simulations to account for them. The disk-dominated
models show strong, short-lived mm/IR flares, with short (<~ 1hr) time lags
between the mm and IR wavelengths, that arise from strong-field gravitational
lensing of magnetic flux tubes near the horizon. Such events provide a natural

redshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. Given
different parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric S/N
ratios, SED fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies and
correlated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to
quantify these effects individually. We studied the sensitivity of stellar mass
estimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, star
formation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometric
uncertainties, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the difference
between the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulation

fundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. We measured different
components of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). no
significant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all having
comparable scatter; (2). A source of error is found to be due to photometric
uncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). The median

pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (pNGB) of a strong sector, typically have light
composite fermions (top partners) to account for a light Higgs. This type of
models generically also predicts the existence of heavy vector fields
(composite gluons) which appear as an octet of QCD. These composite gluons
generically become very broad resonances once phase-space allows them to decay
into two composite fermions. This makes their traditional experimental
searches, which are designed to look for narrow resonances, quite ineffective.
In this paper we, as an alternative, propose to utilize the impact of composite
gluons on the production of top partners to constrain their parameter space. We
place constraints on the parameters of the composite resonances using the 8 TeV
LHC data and also assess the reach of the 14 TeV LHC. We find that the high
luminosity LHC will be able to probe composite gluon masses up to $\sim 6$ TeV,
even in the broad resonance regime.

of physics. A fundamental phenomenon in condensed-matter physics, optical
physics and acoustics, arising from reciprocity, is the constructive
interference of quantum or classical waves which propagate along time-reversed
paths in disordered media, leading to, for example, weak localization and
metal-insulator transition. Previous studies have shown that such coherent
effects are suppressed when reciprocity is broken. Here we show that by
breaking reciprocity in a controlled manner, we can tune, rather than simply
suppress, these phenomena. In particular, we manipulate coherent backscattering
of light, also known as weak localization. By utilizing a non-reciprocal
magneto-optical effect, we control the interference between time-reversed paths
inside a multimode fiber with strong mode mixing, and realize a continuous
transition from the well-known peak to a dip in the backscattered intensity.
Our results may open new possibilities for coherent control of classical and

precise. We study two examples: $U(1)$ gauge theories with chiral matter, and
world-volume theories of ""dynamical surface operators"" of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$

theory are realized as topological winding numbers in the effective theory on
the Coulomb branch. In the latter, we show that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between topological charges of the effective theory of the
dynamical surface operator and the electric, magnetic, and flavor charges of
the 4d gauge theory. We also examine the topologically charged massive BPS
states on $S^1$ and discover that the massive BPS spectrum is sensitive to the
radius of the circle in the simplest theory---the free theory of a periodic
twisted chiral field. We clarify this behavior by showing that the massive BPS
spectrum on $S^1$, unlike the BPS ground states, cannot be identified as

non-equilibrium dynamics of quasi-low dimensional cold atom systems. In this
article we obtain the universal scaling relations for the generalized
reflection coefficient, i.e., the fraction of atoms scattered out of the
initial state, at intermediate energies scales. These intermediate energies are
larger than the trap frequency, but necessarily smaller than the effective
range of the inter-atomic potential. For harmonically confined one and two
dimensional geometries, whenever the energy of the system is commensurate with
a transverse energy level, it is shown that the system becomes non-interacting.
For energies close to a transverse energy level, the reflection coefficient and
scattering dynamics take on universal scaling forms, only depending on the
difference between the energy of the particles and the transverse energy level.
In this article, the universal power law behaviors of these scattering
observables are obtained.

after a 3+1 splitting, of a well defined action principle for asymptotically
flat gravity. More precisely, our starting point is the gravitational first
order Holst action with surface terms and fall-off conditions that make the
variational principle and the covariant phase space formulation well defined
for asymptotically flat spacetimes. Keeping all surface terms and paying due
attention to subtleties that arise from the different cut-offs at infinity, we
give a derivation of the gravitational Hamiltonian starting from this action.
The 3+1 decomposition and time gauge fixing results in a well defined
Hamiltonian action and a well defined Hamiltonian formulation for the standard
-and more general- asymptotic ADM conditions. Unlike the case of the
Einstein-Hilbert action with Gibbons-Hawking-York or Hawking-Horowitz terms,
here we {\it {do}} recover the ADM energy-momentum from the covariant surface
term also when more general variations respecting asymptotic flatness are
allowed. Additionally, our strategy yields a derivation of the parity
conditions for connection variables independent of the conditions given by
Regge and Teitelboim for ADM variables. Finally, we exhibit the other
Poincar\'e generators in terms of real Ashtekar-Barbero variables. We
complement previous constructions in self-dual variables by pointing out
several subtleties and refining the argument showing that -on shell- they
coincide with the ADM charges. Our results represent the first consistent
treatment of the Hamiltonian formulation for the connection-tetrad
gravitational degrees of freedom, starting from a well posed action, in the
case of asymptotically flat boundary conditions.

work, a steady-state flow in a duct is considered under the condition that the
turbulent diffusion is governed by a fractional power of the Laplace operator.
To study numerically flows in rectangular channels, finite-difference
approximations are employed. For approximate solving the corresponding boundary
value problem, the iterative method of conjugate gradients is used. At each
iteration, the problem with a fractional power of the grid Laplace operator is
solved. Predictions of turbulent flows in ducts at different Reynolds numbers
are presented via mean velocity fields.

functions employed to yield the desired probabilistic guarantees are often too
complicated to be practical. Here we survey recent results on how simple
hashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees.
  Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist [1970]. Keys are viewed as
consisting of $c$ characters and we have precomputed character tables
$h_1,...,h_c$ mapping characters to random hash values. A key $x=(x_1,...,x_c)$
is hashed to $h_1[x_1] \oplus h_2[x_2].....\oplus h_c[x_c]$. This schemes is
very fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even
4-independent, it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally
obtained via higher independence, e.g., linear probing and Cuckoo hashing.
  Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is ""twisted"" in
a simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional
properties: Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for
min-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number
generator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and
data-structures.
  Finally, we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation
functions, applying one to the output of the other, and show that this yields
very high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman [1977]. In
fact, w.h.p., for a given set of size proportional to that of the space
consumed, double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some
more elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given
time and space.
  While these tabulation schemes are all easy to implement and use, their
analysis is not.

four years of time series photometry from Kepler. A rapid $P =
0.592596\pm0.00021$ day rotation period is measured due to the $\sim$2.2\%
starspot-induced flux modulations in the light curve. We first use a light
curve modeling approach, using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler to solve for
the longitudes and radii of the two spots within 5-day windows of data. Within
each window of time the starspots are assumed to be unchanging. Only a weak
constraint on the starspot latitudes can be implied from our modeling. The
primary spot is found to be very stable over many years. A secondary spot
feature is present in three portions of the light curve, decays on 100-500 day
timescales, and moves in longitude over time. We interpret this longitude
shearing as the signature of differential rotation. Using our models we measure
an average shear between the starspots of 0.0047 rad day$^{-1}$, which
corresponds to a differential rotation rate of $\Delta\Omega = 0.012 \pm 0.002$
rad day$^{-1}$. We also fit this starspot phase evolution using a series of
bivariate Gaussian functions, which provides a consistent shear measurement.
This is among the slowest differential rotation shear measurements yet measured
for a star in this temperature regime, and provides an important constraint for
dynamo models of low mass stars.

red giant stars from the CoRoT and Kepler missions paves the way for various
statistical studies of the seismic properties of stellar populations.
  Aims. We use the first detailed spectroscopic study of 19 CoRoT red-giant
stars (Morel et al 2014) to compare theoretical stellar evolution models to
observations of the open cluster NGC 6633 and field stars.
  Methods. In order to explore the effects of rotation-induced mixing and
thermohaline instability, we compare surface abundances of carbon isotopic
ratio and lithium with stellar evolution predictions. These chemicals are
sensitive to extra-mixing on the red-giant branch.
  Results. We estimate mass, radius, and distance for each star using the
seismic constraints. We note that the Hipparcos and seismic distances are
different. However, the uncertainties are such that this may not be
significant. Although the seismic distances for the cluster members are self
consistent they are somewhat larger than the Hipparcos distance. This is an
issue that should be considered elsewhere. Models including thermohaline
instability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the seismically
determined masses can explain the chemical properties of red-giants targets.
However, with this sample of stars we cannot perform stringent tests of the
current stellar models. Tighter constraints on the physics of the models would
require the measurement of the core and surface rotation rates, and of the
period spacing of gravity-dominated mixed modes. A larger number of stars with
longer times series, as provided by Kepler or expected with Plato, would help
for ensemble asteroseismology.

(or, more generically, charge-density wave) phase, which sets in at higher
doping. We phenomenologically assume a quantum critical character for the
longitudinal and transverse nematic, and for the charge-ordering fluctuations,
and investigate the effects of these fluctuations in Raman spectra. We find
that the longitudinal nematic fluctuations peaked at zero transferred momentum
account well for the anomalous Raman absorption observed in these systems in
the $B_{2g}$ channel, while the absence of such effect in the $B_{1g}$ channel
may be due to the overall suppression of Raman response at low frequencies,
associated with the pseudogap. While in Y$_{0.97}$Ca$_{0.03}$BaCuO$_{6.05}$ the

modes alone, in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ also charge-ordering modes with finite

very important class of models in game theory. They have special properties

introduces graphical versions of potential games. Special cases of graphical
potential games have already found applicability in many areas of science and
engineering beyond economics, including artificial intelligence, computer
vision, and machine learning. They have been effectively applied to the study
and solution of important real-world problems such as routing and congestion in
networks, distributed resource allocation (e.g., public goods), and
relaxation-labeling for image segmentation. Implicit use of graphical potential
games goes back at least 40 years. Several classes of games considered standard
in the literature, including coordination games, local interaction games,
lattice games, congestion games, and party-affiliation games, are instances of
graphical potential games. This note provides several characterizations of
graphical potential games by leveraging well-known results from the literature
on probabilistic graphical models. A major contribution of the work presented
here that particularly distinguishes it from previous work is establishing that
the convergence of certain type of game-playing rules implies that the
agents/players must be embedded in some graphical potential game.

Studying the group of linear canonical transformations, we show the relations
between unitary evolution and choice of canonical variables. From these
relations we obtain the conditions on the Hamiltonian such that there are
canonical variables for which the field has unitary evolution. We then compute
the linear transformation leading to these variables, also proving that they
are unique. We obtain these results by developing the asymptotic analysis of
the fields using the action angle variables, which proves to be a
generalization of the usual Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. These
tools allow us to re-frame the adiabatic vacuum condition in a extensible
format by using the action angle variables to relate these vacuum choices to
those where the particle number density does not depend on angle (fast)
variables. Finally, we develop a larger set of canonical variables relating the
adiabatic vacuum conditions with the smearing of the quantum fields. This set
of canonical variables also connects the adiabatic vacuum conditions with the

communication data has made it possible to study human behavior on a larger
scale than ever before. From this, it has been discovered that across a diverse
range of data sets, the inter-event times between consecutive communication
events obey heavy tailed power law dynamics. Explaining this has proved
controversial, and two distinct hypotheses have emerged. The first holds that
these power laws are fundamental, and arise from the mechanisms such as
priority queuing that humans use to schedule tasks. The second holds that they
are a statistical artifact which only occur in aggregated data when features
such as circadian rhythms and burstiness are ignored. We use a large social
media data set to test these hypotheses, and find that although models that
incorporate circadian rhythms and burstiness do explain part of the observed
heavy tails, there is residual unexplained heavy tail behavior which suggests a
more fundamental cause. Based on this, we develop a new quantitative model of
human behavior which improves on existing approaches, and gives insight into
the mechanisms underlying human interactions.

self-consistently has been a challenge in the past. Here we present results
from simulations that couple particle kinetics with hydrodynamics of the
atmospheric plasma. We combine the Stanford unified Fokker-Planck code that
models particle acceleration and transport with the RADYN hydrodynamic code
that models the atmospheric response to collisional heating by accelerated
electrons through detailed radiative transfer calculations. We perform
simulations using two different electron spectra, one an {\it ad hoc} power law
and the other predicted by the model of stochastic acceleration by turbulence
or plasma waves. Surprisingly, the later model, even with energy flux $\ll
10^{10}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, can cause ""explosive"" chromospheric
evaporation and drive stronger up- and downflows (and hydrodynamic shocks).
This is partly because our acceleration model, like many others, produces a
spectrum consisting of a quasi-thermal component plus a power-law tail. We
synthesize emission line profiles covering different heights in the lower
atmosphere, including H$\alpha$ 6563 \AA, HeII 304 \AA, CaII K 3934 \AA\ and
SiIV 1393 \AA. One interesting result is the unusual high temperature (up to a
few $10^5$ K) of the formation site of HeII 304 \AA, which is expected due to
photoionization-recombination under flare conditions, compared to those in the
quiet Sun dominated by collisional excitation. When compared with observations,
our results can constrain the properties of non-thermal electrons and thus the
poorly understood particle acceleration mechanism.

companies seem to first be divided based on sector, with geographical
subclusters emerging within each industrial sector. We argue that standard
techniques for detecting overlapping clusters and communities are not able to
capture this type of structure, and show how robust regression techniques can
instead be used to remove the influence of both sector and geography from the
correlation matrix separately. Our analysis reveals that prior to the 2008

Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations resolve the radio source into a

obtained by several scientific teams, including ours, to find that the
percentage of anti-Hale groups becomes indeed maximal during a solar minimum.
Our interpretation is that this fact may be explained by the small-scale dynamo
action inside the solar convective zone.

undergone by a nuclear spin system in a solid, coupled to the phonon field
through the dipolar interaction. The calculations are performed for a chain of
weakly interacting 1/2-spin pairs, considered as an open quantum system in
contact with a bosonic heat bath. By incorporating to the whole system
Hamiltonian the fluctuations of the local dipolar energy produced by low
frequency phonons, and assuming that this low energy fluctuations are
adiabatic, we find that the spin dynamics can be described in closed form
through a spin-boson model. The obtained results show that the coupling with
the phonons destroy the spin coherence, and the efficiency of the process
significantly depends on the complexity of the involved spin states. By using
realistic values for the various parameters of the model, we conclude that this
mechanism can be particularly efficient to degrade multi-spin coherences, when
the number of `active' spins involved in a given coherence is high. In this
way, we show that the spin coherence in the adiabatic regime can be noticeably
affected by this mechanism.

parsing task, namely annotating each image pixel with its corresponding
category label. For a given test image, first, a locality-aware retrieval set
is extracted from the training data based on super-pixel matching similarities,
which are augmented with feature extraction for better differentiation of local
super-pixels. Then, the category of each super-pixel is initialized by the
majority vote of the $k$-nearest-neighbor super-pixels in the retrieval set.
Instead of fixing $k$ as in traditional non-parametric approaches, here we
propose a novel adaptive nonparametric approach which determines the
sample-specific k for each test image. In particular, $k$ is adaptively set to
be the number of the fewest nearest super-pixels which the images in the
retrieval set can use to get the best category prediction. Finally, the initial
super-pixel labels are further refined by contextual smoothing. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of the new

states which carry two supercurrents with different amplitudes. When the
magnetization direction of the ferromagnet is suitably chosen, two
supercurrents experience opposite phase shifts from the conventional sinusoidal
current-phase relation. Then the total Josephson current results in a
continuously tunable ground-state phase difference by adjusting the ferromagnet
parameters and the triplet-singlet ratio of noncentrosymmetric superconductors.
The physics picture and analytical results are given on the basis of the
$s$+$p$ wave, while the numerical results are reported on both $s$+$p$ and
$d$+$p$ waves. For the $d$+$p$ wave, we find novel states in which the
supercurrents are totally carried by continuous propagating states instead of
discrete Andreev bound states. Instead of carrying supercurrent, the Andreev
bound states which here only appear above the Fermi energy block the
supercurrent flowing along the opposite direction. These novel states advance
the understaning of the relation between Andreev bound states and the Josephson
current. And the ground-state phase difference serves as a tool to determine

tractably, it is beneficial to have strong guarantees on the tractable
approximate solutions. In order operate under these criterion most optimization
problems are cast under the umbrella of convexity or submodularity. In this
report we will study design and optimization over a common class of functions
called submodular functions. Set functions, and specifically submodular set
functions, characterize a wide variety of naturally occurring optimization
problems, and the property of submodularity of set functions has deep
theoretical consequences with wide ranging applications. Informally, the
property of submodularity of set functions concerns the intuitive ""principle of
diminishing returns. This property states that adding an element to a smaller
set has more value than adding it to a larger set. Common examples of
submodular monotone functions are entropies, concave functions of cardinality,
and matroid rank functions; non-monotone examples include graph cuts, network
flows, and mutual information.
  In this paper we will review the formal definition of submodularity; the
optimization of submodular functions, both maximization and minimization; and

  Oligomer",,,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hardy and Higgins first proposed the amyloid cascade hypothesis in 1992,
stating that the decrease in neuronal function observed in Alzheimer's Disease
(AD) is due to a process initiated by the oligomerization of amyloid-beta
peptides. One hypothesis states that toxicity arises from the aggregation of
amyloid-beta into a pore structure, which can then puncture the brain cell
membrane; this allow toxic calcium ions to flood through the opening, causing
eventual cell death. In 2007, neurobiologist Ruth Nussinov calculated the three
pore sizes most likely to occur within the brain. Based on her findings, we
constructed a method to determine the time it takes for a cell to die after the
cell is punctured by the pore. Our findings have shown that cell death occurs
within one second after the oligomer makes contact with the cell. We believe
this is important because instant cell death has been one criticism of
Nussinov's model, and we have calculated a concrete time value for that
criticism. We identify two potential deficiencies with our model that could be
improved: first, we treat the calcium as an ideal gas, which it is not; second,
we assume that the pores are static (i.e. constantly open), while recent
developments suggest that they may open and close dynamically.

redshifts $z > 6$, when the Universe was only 900 million years old, raises the
question of how such massive compact objects could form in a cosmologically
short time interval. Each of the standard scenarios proposed, involving rapid
accretion of seed black holes or black hole mergers, faces severe theoretical
difficulties in explaining the short-time formation of supermassive objects. In
this work we propose an alternative scenario for the formation of SMBH in the
early Universe, in which energy transfer from superconducting cosmic strings
piercing small seed black holes is the main physical process leading to rapid
mass increase. As a toy model, the accretion rate of a seed black hole pierced
by two antipodal strings carrying constant current is considered. Using an
effective action approach, which phenomenologically incorporates a large class
of superconducting string models, we estimate the minimum current required to
form SMBH with masses of order $M = 2 \times 10^{9}M_{\odot}$ by $z = 7.085$.
This corresponds to the mass of the central black hole powering the quasar ULAS
J112001.48+064124.3 and is taken as a test case scenario for early-epoch SMBH
formation. For GUT scale strings, the required fractional increase in the
string energy density, due to the presence of the current, is of order
$10^{-7}$, so that their existence remains consistent with current
observational bounds on the string tension. In addition, we consider an
""exotic"" scenario, in which an SMBH is generated when a small seed black hole
is pierced by a higher-dimensional $F-$string, predicted by string theory. We
find that both topological defect strings and fundamental strings are able to
carry currents large enough to generate early-epoch SMBH via our proposed
mechanism.

functions for various media. The dyadic Green's functions are found using the

For the lossless media cases, the spectral functions can be directly related to
the photon local density of states, and hence, to the electromagnetic energy
density. For the lossy case, the spectral function can be related to the field
correlation function. Because of these properties, one can derive properties
for field correlations and the Langevin-source correlations without resorting
to the fluctuation dissipation theorem. The results are corroborated by the

a distance 'd' is arguably the most important tracer of what happens to gas
accreting onto a disk galaxy. Recent observations reveal that the Stream's mass
is in fact dominated (3:1) by its ionised component. Here we revisit the origin
of the mysterious H-alpha recombination emission observed along much of its
length that is overly bright (~150-200 milli-Rayleigh) for the known Galactic
ultraviolet background (~20-40 mR / [d/55 kpc]^2). In an earlier model, we
proposed that a slow shock cascade was operating along the Stream due to its
interaction with the extended Galactic hot corona. We find that, for a smooth
coronal density profile, this model can explain the bright H-alpha emission if
the coronal density satisfies 2 < (n / 10^{-4} cm^{-3}) < 4 at d = 55 kpc. But
in view of updated parameters for the Galactic halo and mounting evidence that
most of the Stream must lie far beyond the Magellanic Clouds (d>55 kpc), we
revisit the shock cascade model in detail. At lower densities, the HI gas is
broken down by the shock cascade but mostly mixes with the hot corona without
significant recombination. At higher densities, the hot coronal mass (including
the other baryonic components) exceeds the baryon budget of the Galaxy. If the
H-alpha emission arises from the shock cascade, the upper limit on the smooth
coronal density constrains the Stream's mean distance to < 75 kpc. If, as some
models indicate, the Stream is even further out, either the shock cascade is
operating in a regime where the corona is substantially mass-loaded with recent
gas debris, or an entirely different ionization mechanism is responsible.

a finer scale. The automated search and classification is performed using a set
of cool star templates assembled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

despite shortcomings in the LAMOST commissioning data which include bright sky
lines in the red. In particular we find that the absolute and relative
strengths of the critical TiO and CaH molecular bands around 7000A are cleanly
measured, which provides accurate spectral typing from late-K to mid-M, and
makes it possible to estimate metallicities in a way that is more efficient and
reliable than with the use of spectral indices or spectral-index based
parameters such as zeta. Most of the cool dwarfs observed by LAMOST are found
to be metal-rich dwarfs. We use a calibration of spectral type to absolute
magnitude and estimate spectroscopic distances for all the stars; we also
recover proper motions from the SUPERBLINK and PPMXL catalogs. Our analysis of
the estimated transverse motions suggests a mean velocity and standard

W=-7.9 km/s. The resulting values are general agreement with previous reported

light curve evolutions and color evolutions are similar to those of SNe Iax

$M_{H}\sim-18.3$ mag) and the rate of decline of the light curve ($\Delta$

The estimated rise time is $12.0 \pm 3.0$ days, which is significantly shorter
than that of SN 2005hk or any other Ia SNe. The rapid rise indicates that the

opacity may be lower than that in normal SNe Ia. The late-phase spectrum
exhibits broader emission lines than those of SN 2005hk by a factor of 6--8.
Such high velocities of the emission lines indicate that the density profile of
the inner ejecta extends more than that of SN 2005hk. We argue that the most

pulsational delayed detonations is not excluded.

  analysis",,,,,"cs.CV cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Singular spectrum analysis is developed as a nonparametric spectral
decomposition of a time series. It can be easily extended to the decomposition
of multidimensional lattice-like data through the filtering interpretation. In
this viewpoint, the singular spectrum analysis can be understood as the
adaptive and optimal generation of the filters and their two-step
point-symmetric operation to the original data. In this paper, we point out
that, when applied to the multidimensional data, the adaptively generated
filters exhibit symmetry properties resulting from the bisymmetric nature of
the lag-covariance matrices. The eigenvectors of the lag-covariance matrix are
either symmetric or antisymmetric, and for the 2D image data, these lead to the
differential-type filters with even- or odd-order derivatives. The dominant
filter is a smoothing filter, reflecting the dominance of low-frequency
components of the photo images. The others are the edge-enhancement or the
noise filters corresponding to the band-pass or the high-pass filters. The
implication of the decomposition to the image denoising is briefly discussed.

particle orbiting a Kerr black hole, due to the gravitational radiation
reaction. For this purpose, we use the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation in the
first order black hole perturbation theory, with the expansion with respect to
the orbital eccentricity. In this work, the calculation is done up to the
fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) order and to the sixth order of the eccentricity,
including the effect of the absorption of gravitational waves by the black
hole. We confirm that, in the Kerr case, the effect of the absorption appears
at the 2.5PN order beyond the leading order in the secular change of the
particle's energy and may induce a superradiance, as known previously for
circular orbits. In addition, we find that the superradiance may be suppressed
when the orbital plane inclines with respect to the equatorial plane of the
central black hole. We also investigate the accuracy of the 4PN formulae by
comparing to numerical results. If we require that the relative errors in the
4PN formulae are less than $10^{-5}$, the parameter region to satisfy the
condition will be $p\gtrsim 50$ for $e=0.1$, $p\gtrsim 80$ for $e=0.4$, and
$p\gtrsim 120$ for $e=0.7$ almost irrespective of the inclination angle nor the
spin of the black hole, where $p$ and $e$ are the semi-latus rectum and the
eccentricity of the orbit. The region can further be extended using an
exponential resummation method to $p\gtrsim 40$ for $e=0.1$, $p\gtrsim 60$ for
$e=0.4$, and $p\gtrsim 100$ for $e=0.7$. Although we still need the higher
order calculations of the PN approximation and the expansion with respect to
the orbital eccentricity to apply for data analysis of gravitational waves, the
results in this paper would be an important improvement from the previous work
at the 2.5PN order, especially for large $p$ region.

fundamental issue in central spin decoherence and also of practical importance
in designing noise-resilient quantum control. Spin qubits based on bismuth
donors in silicon have tunable interactions with nuclear spin baths and are
first-order insensitive to magnetic noise at so-called clock-transitions (CTs).
This system is therefore ideal for studying the quantum/classical nature of
nuclear spin baths since the qubit-bath interaction strength determines the
back-action on the baths and hence the adequacy of a classical noise model. We
develop a Gaussian noise model with noise correlations determined by quantum
calculations and compare the classical noise approximation to the full quantum
bath theory. We experimentally test our model through dynamical decoupling
sequence of up to 128 pulses, finding good agreement with simulations and
measuring electron spin coherence times approaching one second - notably using
natural silicon. Our theoretical and experimental study demonstrates that the
noise from a nuclear spin bath is analogous to classical Gaussian noise if the
back-action of the qubit on the bath is small compared to the internal bath
dynamics, as is the case close to CTs. However, far from the CTs, the
back-action of the central spin on the bath is such that the quantum model is
required to accurately model spin decoherence.

on its role, in combination with cooling and electromagnetic effects, in
determining the properties of the hypermassive neutron star resulting from the
merger, the production of neutrinos, and the characteristics of ejecta from the

soft equations of state produce more ejecta than stiffer equations of state.
Moreover, the degree of neutron richness increases for softer equations of
state. In light of reported kilonova observations (associated to GRB~130603B

radioactive elements in deep sea deposits (with respect to possible production
via supernovae), we speculate that a soft EoS might be preferred---because of
its significant production of sufficiently neutron rich ejecta---if such events
are driven by binary neutron star mergers. We also find that realistic magnetic
field strengths, obtained with a sub-grid model tuned to capture magnetic
amplification via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at merger, are generally too
weak to affect the gravitational wave signature post-merger within a time scale
of $\approx 10$~ms but can have subtle effects on the post-merger dynamics.

dimensional self-consistent field calculations, we study the equilibrium
properties and the switching behavior of adsorption-active polymer chains
included in a homopolymer brush. The switching transition is driven by a
conformational change of a small fraction of minority chains, which are
attracted by the substrate. Depending on the strength of the attractive
interaction, the minority chains assume one of two states: An exposed state
characterized by a stem-crown-like conformation, and an adsorbed state
characterized by a flat two-dimensional structure. Comparing the Monte Carlo
simulations, which use an Edwards-type Hamiltonian with density dependent
interactions, with the predictions from self-consistent-field theory based on
the same Hamiltonian, we find that thermal density fluctuations affect the
system in two different ways. First, they renormalize the excluded volume
interaction parameter $v_\mathrm{\tiny bare}$ inside the brush. The properties
of the brushes can be reproduced by self-consistent field theory if one
replaces $v_\mathrm{\tiny bare}$ by an effective parameter $v_{\mathrm{\tiny
eff}}$, where the ratio of second virial coefficients $B_{\mathrm{\tiny
eff}}/B_\mathrm{\tiny bare}$ depends on the range of monomer interactions, but
not on the grafting density, the chain length, and $v_\mathrm{\tiny bare}$.
Second, density fluctuations affect the conformations of chains at the brush
surface and have a favorable effect on the characteristics of the switching
transition: In the interesting regime where the transition is sharp, they
reduce the free energy barrier between the two states significantly. The
scaling behavior of various quantities is also analyzed and compared with
analytical predictions.

details about the formation and triggering mechanism of twisting jet. We
identify a pre-existing flux rope associated with a sinistral filament, which
was observed several days before the event. The confined eruption of the
filament within a null point topology, also known as an Eiffel tower (or
inverted-Y) magnetic field configuration results in the formation of a twisted
jet after the magnetic reconnection near a null point. The sign of helicity in
the jet is found to be the same as that of the sign of helicity in the
filament. Untwisting motion of the reconnected magnetic field lines gives rise
to the accelerating plasma along the jet axis. The event clearly shows the
twist injection from the pre-eruptive magnetic field to the jet.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, up-to-date, the sensing schemes
suggested by CS theories are made of random isolated measurements, which are
usually incompatible with the physics of acquisition. To reflect the physical
constraints of the imaging device, we introduce the notion of blocks of
measurements: the sensing scheme is not a set of isolated measurements anymore,
but a set of groups of measurements which may represent any arbitrary shape
(parallel or radial lines for instance). Structured acquisition with blocks of
measurements are easy to implement, and provide good reconstruction results in
practice. However, very few results exist on the theoretical guarantees of CS
reconstructions in this setting. In this paper, we derive new CS results for
structured acquisitions and signals satisfying a prior structured sparsity. The
obtained results provide a recovery probability of sparse vectors that
explicitly depends on their support. Our results are thus support-dependent and
offer the possibility for flexible assumptions on the sparsity structure.
Moreover, the results are drawing-dependent, since we highlight an explicit
dependency between the probability of reconstructing a sparse vector and the
way of choosing the blocks of measurements. Numerical simulations show that the
proposed theory is faithful to experimental observations.

self-sustaining due to the ramp-up problem or dwindling activity within the

others. Only a small fraction of these systems manage to reach self-sustaining
activity, a level of activity that prevents the system from reverting to a
non-active state. In this paper, we model and analyze activity dynamics in
synthetic and empirical collaboration networks. Our approach is based on two
opposing and well-studied principles: (i) without incentives, users tend to
lose interest to contribute and thus, systems become inactive, and (ii) people
are susceptible to actions taken by their peers (social or peer influence).
With the activity dynamics model that we introduce in this paper we can
represent typical situations of such collaboration networks. For example,
activity in a collaborative network, without external impulses or investments,
will vanish over time, eventually rendering the system inactive. However, by
appropriately manipulating the activity dynamics and/or the underlying
collaboration networks, we can jump-start a previously inactive system and
advance it towards an active state. To be able to do so, we first describe our
model and its underlying mechanisms. We then provide illustrative examples of
empirical datasets and characterize the barrier that has to be breached by a
system before it can become self-sustaining in terms of critical mass and
activity dynamics. Additionally, we expand on this empirical illustration and
introduce a new metric p---the Activity Momentum---to assess the activity
robustness of collaboration networks.

facilitate access to reputation manipulation services such as fake Facebook
likes, fraudulent search engine optimization (SEO), or bogus Amazon reviews. In
order to deploy effective technical and legal countermeasures, it is important
to understand how these black-hat marketplaces operate, shedding light on the
services they offer, who is selling, who is buying, what are they buying, who
is more successful, why are they successful, etc. Toward this goal, in this
paper, we present a detailed micro-economic analysis of a popular online
black-hat marketplace, namely, SEOClerks.com. As the site provides
non-anonymized transaction information, we set to analyze selling and buying
behavior of individual users, propose a strategy to identify key users, and
study their tactics as compared to other (non-key) users. We find that key
users: (1) are mostly located in Asian countries, (2) are focused more on
selling black-hat SEO services, (3) tend to list more lower priced services,
and (4) sometimes buy services from other sellers and then sell at higher
prices. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis with respect to
devising effective economic and legal intervention strategies against
marketplace operators and key users.

dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs) with the formula of

calculated band structures show a direct band gap for monolayer TMDCs at the K

bilayer, the reduced indirect band gaps are found except for bilayer WTe$_2$,
in which direct gap is still present at the K point. The calculated in-plane
Young moduli are comparable to graphene, which promises the possible
application of TMDCs in future flexible and stretchable electronic devices. We
also evaluated the performance of different functionals including LDA, PBE, and
optB88-vdW in describing elastic moduli of TMDCs and found that LDA seems to be
the most qualified method. Moreover, our calculations suggest that the Young
moduli for bilayers are insensitive to stacking orders and the mechanical

developmental and disease-related processes such as epithelial closure and
wound healing. A key challenge for epithelial tissues undergoing spreading is
to increase their surface area without disrupting epithelial integrity. Here we
show that orienting cell divisions by tension constitutes an efficient
mechanism by which the Enveloping Cell Layer (EVL) releases anisotropic tension
while undergoing spreading during zebrafish epiboly. The control of EVL
cell-division orientation by tension involves cell elongation and requires
myosin II activity to align the mitotic spindle with the main tension axis. We
also found that in the absence of tension-oriented cell divisions and in the
presence of increased tissue tension, EVL cells undergo ectopic fusions,
suggesting that the reduction of tension anisotropy by oriented cell divisions
is required to prevent EVL cells from fusing. We conclude that cell-division
orientation by tension constitutes a key mechanism for limiting tension
anisotropy and thus promoting tissue spreading during EVL epiboly.

spheres having size distributions in terms of weighed random geometrical
graphs, in which vertex coordinates correspond to random positions of the
sphere centers and edges are formed between any two overlapping spheres. Edge
weights naturally arise from the different radii of two overlapping spheres.
For the case in which the spheres have bounded size distributions, we show that
clusters of connected spheres are tree-like for $d\rightarrow \infty$ and they
contain no closed loops. In this case, we find that the mean cluster size
diverges at the percolation threshold density $\eta_c\rightarrow 2^{-d}$,
independently of the particular size distribution. We also show that the mean
number of overlaps for a particle at criticality $z_c$ is smaller than unity,
while $z_c\rightarrow 1$ only for spheres with fixed radii. We explain these
features by showing that in the large dimensionality limit the critical
connectivity is dominated by the spheres with the largest size. Assuming that
closed loops can be neglected also for unbounded radii distributions, we find
that the asymptotic critical threshold for systems of spheres with radii
following a lognormal distribution is no longer universal, and that it can be
smaller than $2^{-d}$ for $d\rightarrow\infty$.

progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Based on smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, previous studies claimed that mergers of CO
WDs lead to an SN Ia explosion either in the dynamical merger phase or
stationary rotating merger remnant phase. However, the mass range of CO WDs
that lead to an SN Ia has not been clearly identified yet. In the present work,
we perform systematic SPH merger simulations for the WD masses ranging from
$0.5~M_{\odot}$ to $1.1~M_{\odot}$ with higher resolutions than the previous
systematic surveys and examine whether or not carbon burning occurs dynamically
or quiescently in each phase. We further study the possibility of SN Ia
explosion and estimate the mass range of CO WDs that lead to an SN Ia. We found
that when the both WDs are massive, i.e., in the mass range of $0.9~M_{\odot}
{\le} M_{1,2} {\le} 1.1~M_{\odot}$, they can explode as an SN Ia in the merger
phase. On the other hand, when the more massive WD is in the range of
$0.7~M_{\odot} {\le} M_{1} {\le} 0.9~M_{\odot}$ and the total mass exceeds
$1.38~M_{\odot}$, they can finally explode in the stationary rotating merger
remnant phase. We estimate the contribution of CO WD mergers to the entire SN
Ia rate in our galaxy to be of ${\lt} 9\%$. So, it might be difficult to
explain all galactic SNe Ia by CO WD mergers.

studies of this diagram have shown that the mean-field magnetization
surprisingly deviates from the value predicted by Lieb's theorem
\cite{Lieb1989} as the on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction ($U$) becomes
smaller \cite{Gouveia2015}. Here, we show that in order for Lieb's theorem to
be satisfied, a more complex mean-field approach should be followed in the case
of bipartite lattices or other lattices whose unit cells contain more than two
types of atoms. In the case of the Lieb lattice, we show that, by allowing the
system to modulate the magnetization and charge density between sublattices,
the difference in the absolute values of the magnetization of the sublattices,
$m_{\text{Lieb}}$, at half-filling, saturates at the exact value $1/2$ for any
value of $U$, as predicted by Lieb. Additionally, Lieb's relation,
$m_{\text{Lieb}}=1/2$, is verified approximately for large $U$, in the $n \in
[2/3,4/3]$ range. This range includes not only the ferromagnetic region of the
phase diagram of the Lieb lattice (see Ref.~\onlinecite{Gouveia2015}), but also
the adjacent spiral regions. In fact, in this lattice, below or at
half-filling, $m_{\text{Lieb}}$ is simply the filling of the quasi-flat bands
in the mean-field energy dispersion both for large and small $U$.

using data sets with strongly imbalanced distributions of the target variable.
Frequently, the least common values of this target variable are associated with
events that are highly relevant for end users (e.g. fraud detection, unusual
returns on stock markets, anticipation of catastrophes, etc.). Moreover, the
events may have different costs and benefits, which when associated with the
rarity of some of them on the available training data creates serious problems
to predictive modelling techniques. This paper presents a survey of existing
techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics.
Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal
target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems
within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey we discuss
the main challenges raised by imbalanced distributions, describe the main
approaches to these problems, propose a taxonomy of these methods and refer to

example, irregular or clumpy galaxies, and their structure in noise is
introduced. ""Noise-based"" and ""non-parametric"" imply that this technique
imposes negligible constraints on the properties of the targets and that it
employs no regression analysis or fittings. The sub-sky detection threshold is
defined and initial detections are found, independently of the sky value. False
detections are then estimated and removed using the ambient noise as a
reference. This results in a purity level of 0.89 for the final detections as
compared to 0.29 for SExtractor when a completeness of 1 is desired for a
sample of extremely faint and diffuse mock galaxy profiles. The difference in
the mean of the undetected pixels with the known background of mock images is
decreased by 4.6 times depending on the diffuseness of the test profiles,
quantifying the success in their detection. A non-parametric approach to
defining substructure over a detected region is also introduced. NoiseChisel is
our software implementation of this new technique. Contrary to the existing
signal-based approach to detection, in its various implementations,
signal-related parameters such as the image point spread function or known
object shapes and models are irrelevant here. Such features make this technique
very useful in astrophysical applications such as detection, photometry, or
morphological analysis of nebulous objects buried in noise, for example,
galaxies that do not generically have a known shape when imaged.

domain. There exists a family of stationary solutions with vorticity given by
$\Omega^*=\alpha\cos (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x} )+\beta \sin (\mathbf{p}

preserving finite dimensional Hamiltonian system by a truncation introduced by
Zeitlin (1990,2005) or by the more standard Galerkin style finite element
method. We use these two truncations to analyse the linear stability of these
solutions and analytical and numerical results are compared. Following the
methods used by Li (2000) the problem is divided into subsystems and we prove
that most subsystems are linearly stable. We derive a sufficient condition for
a subsystem to be linearly unstable and derive an explicit lower bound for the
associated real eigenvalues independent of the truncation size $N$. Then we
show that the corresponding eigenvectors are in $\ell^2$. This together with
known stability results for the 2D periodic Euler equations allows us to
conclude that most of these stationary solutions are nonlinearly unstable. We

performance is evaluated in terms of the Optimal Subpattern Assignment (OSPA)

existing distributed PHD Particle Filter. Furthermore, the robustness of the

charge modulated state with a tripling of the unit cell, a zig-zag phase and a
novel charge ordered states with a 12 site unit cells we call N\'eel domain

but it remains unclear whether an order-by-disorder mechanism will lift the
degeneracy. For intermediate repulsion we find evidence for a Kekul\'e or
plaquette bond-order wave phase. We also investigate the possibility of a
spontaneous Chern insulator phase (dubbed topological Mott insulator), as
previously put forward by several mean-field studies. Although we are unable to
detect convincing evidence for this phase based on energy spectra and order
parameters, we find an enhancement of current-current correlations with the
expected spatial structure compared to the non-interacting situation. While for
the studied $t{-}V_1{-}V_2$ model the phase transition to the putative
topological Mott insulator is preempted by the phase transitions to the various
ordered states, our findings might hint at the possibility for a topological
Mott insulator in an enlarged Hamiltonian parameter space, where the competing

system its temperature must be zero everywhere as a consequence of Tolman's

systematic quantum effects induced by the local coupling between the

depending on nearby nodes in another layer to function. The links in each layer
are often of limited length, due to the construction cost of longer links.
Here, we model such systems as a multiplex network composed of two or more
layers, each with links of characteristic geographic length, embedded in
2-dimensional space. This is equivalent to a system of interdependent spatially
embedded networks in two dimensions in which the connectivity links are
constrained in length but varied while the length of the dependency links is
always zero. We find two distinct percolation transition behaviors depending on
the characteristic length, $\zeta$, of the links. When $\zeta$ is longer than a
certain critical value, $\zeta_c$, abrupt, first-order transitions take place,
while for $\zeta<\zeta_c$ the transition is continuous. We show that, though in
single-layer networks increasing $\zeta$ decreases the percolation threshold
$p_c$, in multiplex networks it has the opposite effect: increasing $p_c$ to a
maximum at $\zeta=\zeta_c$. By providing a more realistic topological model for
spatially embedded interdependent and multiplex networks and highlighting its
similarities to lattice-based models, we provide a new direction for more
detailed future studies.

a key advantage to this new approach, and the horizontal orientation more

a significant subset of the fabrication steps needs to be repeated for each
additional gate. We show that cross-talk between adjacent wrap-gate segments is
negligible despite separations less than 200 nm. We also demonstrate the
ability to make multiple wrap-gate transistors on a single nanowire using the

of a real dielectric substrate out of thermal equilibrium displays distinctive
behaviors as compared to that at thermal equilibrium. In particular, when the

wave-length, the CP force in the high temperature limit can be dramatically
manipulated by varying the relative magnitude of the temperatures of the
substrate and the environment so that the attractive-to-repulsive transition
can occur beyond certain a threshold temperature of either the substrate or the
environment depending on which one is higher for molecules both in the ground

wave-length, such transitions which are impossible at thermal equilibrium may
happen for longitudinally polarizable molecules with a small permittivity,
while for isotropically polarizable ones the transitions can even occur at room
temperature for some dielectric substrates such as sapphire and graphite which
is much lower than the temperature for the transition to take place in the

applications in mathematics, theoretical computer science, information theory
etc. In general, the bound is tight and cannot be improved. However, for some
special families of curves the bound could be improved substantially. In this
paper, we focus on the Hasse-Weil bound for the curve defined by $y^p-y=f(x)$
over the finite field $\F_q$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\F_q$.
Recently, Kaufman and Lovett \cite[FOCS2011]{KL11} showed that the Hasse-Weil
bound can be improved for this family of curves with $f(x)=g(x)+h(x)$, where
$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $\ll \sqrt{q}$ and $h(x)$ is a sparse
polynomial of arbitrary degree but bounded weight degree. The other recent
improvement by Rojas-Leon and Wan \cite[Math. Ann. 2011]{RW11} shows that an
extra $\sqrt{p}$ can be removed for this family of curves if $p$ is very large
compared with polynomial degree of $f(x)$ and $\log_pq$.
  In this paper, we show that the Hasse-Weil bound for this special family of
curves can be improved if $q=p^n$ with odd $n$ which is the same case where
Serre \cite{Se85} improved the Hasse-Weil bound. However, our improvement is
greater than Serre's one for this special family of curves. Furthermore, our
improvement works for small $p$ as well compared with the requirement of large
$p$ by Rojas-Leon and Wan. In addition, our improvement finds interesting
applications to character sums, cryptography and coding theory. The key idea
behind is that this curve has the Hasse-Witt invariant $0$ and we show that the
Hasse-Weil bound can be improved for any curves with the Hasse-Witt invariant
$0$. The main tool used in our proof involves Newton polygon and some results
in algebraic geometry.

of B. We show that a certain natural embedding of the Turing degrees into the
coarse degrees (both uniform and nonuniform) is not surjective. We also show
that if two sets are mutually weakly 3-random, then their coarse degrees form a
minimal pair, in both the uniform and nonuniform cases, but that the same is
not true of every pair of relatively 2-random sets, at least in the nonuniform
coarse degrees.

evolution chains. These evolution chains proposed in the paper contain group
states in the previous time frames and its historical transitions that were
identified using one out of two methods: Stable Group Changes Identification
(SGCI) and Group Evolution Discovery (GED). Based on the observed evolution
chains of various length, structural network features are extracted, validated
and selected as well as used to learn classification models. The experimental
studies were performed on three real datasets with different profile: DBLP,
Facebook and Polish blogosphere. The process of group prediction was analysed
with respect to different classifiers as well as various descriptive feature
sets extracted from evolution chains of different length. The results revealed
that, in general, the longer evolution chains the better predictive abilities
of the classification models. However, chains of length 3 to 7 enabled the
GED-based method to almost reach its maximum possible prediction quality. For
SGCI, this value was at the level of 3 to 5 last periods.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv2189",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the dynamics of bow shock nebulae created by pulsars moving
supersonically through a partially ionized interstellar medium. A fraction of
interstellar neutral hydrogen atoms penetrating into the tail region of a
pulsar wind will undergo photo-ionization due to the UV light emitted by the
nebula, with the resulting mass loading dramatically changing the flow dynamics
of the light leptonic pulsar wind. Using a quasi 1-D hydrodynamic model of both
non-relativistic and relativistic flow, and focusing on scales much larger than
the stand-off distance, we find that if a relatively small density of neutral
hydrogen, as low as $10^{-4}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, penetrate inside the pulsar
wind, this is sufficient to strongly affect the tail flow. Mass loading leads
to the fast expansion of the pulsar wind tail, making the tail flow
intrinsically non-stationary. The shapes predicted for the bow shock nebulae
compare well with observations, both in H$\alpha$ and X-rays.

featuring a large number of devices, each of them with sporadic traffic. Hence,
the number of served devices in a single LTE cell is not determined by the
available aggregate rate, but rather by the limitations of the LTE access
reservation protocol. Specifically, the limited number of contention preambles
and the limited amount of uplink grants per random access response are crucial
to consider when dimensioning LTE networks for MTC. We propose a low-complexity
model of LTE's access reservation protocol that encompasses these two
limitations and allows us to evaluate the outage probability at click-speed.
The model is based chiefly on closed-form expressions, except for the part with
the feedback impact of retransmissions, which is determined by solving a fixed
point equation. Our model overcomes the incompleteness of the existing models
that are focusing solely on the preamble collisions. A comparison with the
simulated LTE access reservation procedure that follows the 3GPP
specifications, confirms that our model provides an accurate estimation of the
system outage event and the number of supported MTC devices.

of a boundary layer (BL) where the gas loses its excess kinetic energy and
settles onto the star. There are still many open questions concerning the BL,
for instance the transport of angular momentum (AM) or the vertical structure.
Aims. It is the aim of this work to investigate the AM transport in the BL
where the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is not operating owing to the
increasing angular velocity $\Omega(r)$ with radius. We will therefore search
for an appropriate mechanism and examine its efficiency and implications.
Methods. We perform 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations in a cylindrical
coordinate system $(r, \varphi)$ for a thin, vertically inte- grated accretion
disk around a young star. We employ a realistic equation of state and include
both cooling from the disk surfaces and radiation transport in radial and
azimuthal direction. The viscosity in the disk is treated by the
{\alpha}-model; in the BL there is no viscosity term included. Results. We find
that our setup is unstable to the sonic instability which sets in shortly after
the simulations have been started. Acoustic waves are generated and traverse
the domain, developing weak shocks in the vicinity of the BL. Furthermore, the
system undergoes recurrent outbursts where the activity in the disk increases
strongly. The instability and the waves do not die out for over 2000 orbits.
Conclusions. There is indeed a purely hydrodynamical mechanism that enables AM
transport in the BL. It is efficient and wave mediated; however, this renders
it a non-local transport method, which means that models of a effective local
viscosity like the {\alpha}-viscosity are probably not applicable in the BL. A
variety of further implications of the non-local AM transport are discussed.

high-statistics WASA-at-COSY data for $\eta \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$. Based on

discoveries: (1) A second-peak effect on the magnetization-hysteresis-loop was
observed in a very wide temperature region, ranging from 2K to 24K. Its general
behavior looks like that in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$; (2) Associated with the second
peak effect, the magnetization relaxation rate is inversely related to the
transient superconducting current density $J_\mathrm{s}$ revealing a quite
general and similar mechanism for the second peak effect in many high

creep model reveals a large glassy exponent $\mu$ and a small intrinsic pinning

Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel
indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with
the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights or at weekends.
They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract
more replies and thus serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent
users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate
more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment
shift of words adopted in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and
exhibits a clear ""negative to positive"" pattern. The above observations, though

Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with
compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing.

One of the popular ways to reduce the dimensionality of the data is to perform
feature selection, i.e, select a subset of relevant and non-redundant features.
Recently, Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS) has been proposed
which formulates the feature selection problem as a quadratic program. It has
been shown to outperform many of the existing feature selection methods for a
variety of applications. Though, better than many existing approaches, the
running time complexity of QPFS is cubic in the number of features, which can
be quite computationally expensive even for moderately sized datasets. In this
paper we propose a novel method for feature selection by integrating k-means
clustering with QPFS. The basic variant of our approach runs k-means to bring
down the number of features which need to be passed on to QPFS. We then enhance
this idea, wherein we gradually refine the feature space from a very coarse
clustering to a fine-grained one, by interleaving steps of QPFS with k-means
clustering. Every step of QPFS helps in identifying the clusters of irrelevant
features (which can then be thrown away), whereas every step of k-means further
refines the clusters which are potentially relevant. We show that our iterative
refinement of clusters is guaranteed to converge. We provide bounds on the
number of distance computations involved in the k-means algorithm. Further,
each QPFS run is now cubic in number of clusters, which can be much smaller
than actual number of features. Experiments on eight publicly available
datasets show that our approach gives significant computational gains (both in
time and memory), over standard QPFS as well as other state of the art feature
selection methods, even while improving the overall accuracy.

Earth-directed events in different stages of their propagation. The study is
primarily based on approximated locations of interplanetary (IP) shocks derived
from type II radio emissions detected by the Wind/WAVES experiment during
1997-2007. Distance-time diagrams resulting from the combination of white-light

descriptive profiles of each CME's journey toward Earth. Furthermore, two
different methods to track and predict the location of CME-driven IP shocks are

modifications to a pre-existing technique that linearly projects the drifting
low-frequency type II emissions to 1 AU. This upgraded method improves
forecasts of shock arrival time by almost 50%. The second predictive method is
proposed on the basis of information derived from the descriptive profiles, and
relies on a single CME height-time point and on low-frequency type II radio
emissions to obtain an approximate value of the shock arrival time at Earth. In
addition, we discuss results on CME-radio emission associations,
characteristics of IP propagation, and the relative success of the forecasting

case of dynamic graph streams, we use this primitive to prove the following
results:
  -- Matching: First, there exists an $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ space algorithm that
returns an exact maximum matching on the assumption the cardinality is at most
$k$. The best previous algorithm used $\tilde{O}(kn)$ space where $n$ is the
number of vertices in the graph and we prove our result is optimal up to

there exists an $\tilde{O}(n^2/\alpha^3)$ space algorithm that returns an
$\alpha$-approximation for matchings of arbitrary size. (Assadi et al. (2015)
showed that this was optimal and independently and concurrently established the
same upper bound.) We generalize both results for weighted matching. Third,
there exists an $\tilde{O}(n^{4/5})$ space algorithm that returns a constant
approximation in graphs with bounded arboricity.
  -- Vertex Cover and Hitting Set: There exists an $\tilde{O}(k^d)$ space
algorithm that solves the minimum hitting set problem where $d$ is the
cardinality of the input sets and $k$ is an upper bound on the size of the
minimum hitting set. We prove this is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our

vertex cover.

$b$-matching, disjoint paths, vertex coloring among others) for which our
subgraph sampling primitive yields fast, small-space dynamic graph stream
algorithms. We then show lower bounds for natural problems outside this family.

cooperation. We propose 60\,GHz picocellular network architecture, called
CogCell, leveraging the ubiquitous WiFi. We propose to use 60\,GHz for the data
plane and 2.4/5GHz for the control plane. The hybrid network architecture
considers an opportunistic fall-back to 2.4/5\,GHz in case of poor connectivity
in the 60\,GHz domain. Further, to avoid the frequent re-beamforming in 60\,GHz
directional links due to mobility, we propose a cognitive module -- a
sensor-assisted intelligent beam switching procedure -- which reduces the
communication overhead. We believe that the CogCell concept will help future
indoor communications and possibly outdoor hotspots, where mobile stations and
access points collaborate with each other to improve the user experience.

degree of complexity, as compared to paradigmatic long-range systems, is
introduced and studied. Working at constant density, in the thermodynamic limit
one can prove the statistical equivalence with the Hamiltonian Mean Field model
(HMF) and $\alpha$-HMF: a second order phase transition is indeed observed at
the critical energy threshold $\varepsilon_c=0.75$. Conversely, when the
thermodynamic limit is performed at infinite density (while keeping the length
of the hosting interval $L$ constant), the critical energy $\varepsilon_c$ is
modulated as a function of $L$. At low energy, a self-organized collective
crystal phase is reported to emerge, which converges to a perfect crystal in
the limit $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. To analyze the phenomenon, the equilibrium
one particle density function is analytically computed by maximizing the
entropy. The transition and the associated critical energy between the gaseous
and the crystal phase is computed. Molecular dynamics show that the crystal
phase is apparently split into two distinct regimes, depending on the the
energy per particle $\varepsilon$. For small $\varepsilon$, particles are
exactly located on the lattice sites; above an energy threshold
$\varepsilon{*}$, particles can travel from one site to another. However,
$\varepsilon{*}$ does not signal a phase transition but reflects the finite
time of observation: the perfect crystal observed for $\varepsilon >0$
corresponds to a long lasting dynamical transient, whose life time increases
when the $\varepsilon >0$ approaches zero.

spherical surface of vanishingly small radius surrounding the charge. We show
that the radiative power losses from a point charge turn out to be proportional
to the scalar product of the instantaneous velocity and the first
time-derivative of the acceleration of the charge. This may seem to be in
discordance with the familiar Larmor's formula where the instantaneous power
radiated from a charge is proportional to the square of acceleration. However,
it seems that the root cause of the discrepancy actually lies in the Larmor's
formula which is derived using the acceleration fields but without a due
consideration for the Poynting flux associated with the velocity-dependent
self-fields ""co-moving"" with the charge. Further, while deriving Larmor's
formula one equates the Poynting flux through a surface at some later time to
the radiation loss by the enclosed charge at the retarded time. Poynting's
theorem, on the other hand, relates the outgoing radiation flux from a closed
surface to the rate of energy decrease within the enclosed volume, all
calculated {\em for the same given instant} only. Here we explicitly show the
absence of any Poynting flux in the neighbourhood of an instantly stationary
point charge, implying no radiative losses from such a charge, which is in
complete conformity with energy conservation. We further show how Larmor's
formula is still able to serve our purpose in vast majority of cases. It is
further shown that Larmor's formula in general violates momentum conservation
and in the case of synchrotron radiation leads to a potentially wrong
conclusion about the pitch angle changes of the radiating charges, and that
only the radiation reaction formula yields a correct result, consistent with
the special relativity.

least squares optimization problem associated with the spectral unmixing task
as an unconstrained regression problem followed by a projection onto the
intersection of several closed convex sets. This projection is achieved by
iteratively projecting onto each of the convex sets individually, following
Dyktra's scheme. The sequence thus obtained is guaranteed to converge to the
sought projection. Thanks to the preliminary matrix decomposition and variable
substitution, the projection is implemented intrinsically in a subspace, whose
dimension is very often much lower than the number of bands. A benefit of this
strategy is that the order of the computational complexity for each projection
is decreased from quadratic to linear time. Numerical experiments considering
diverse spectral unmixing scenarios provide evidence that the proposed
algorithm competes with the state-of-the-art, namely when the number of
endmembers is relatively small, a circumstance often observed in real

Starting from certain equivariant connections, we show that the full set of
instanton equations reduce, with a unique gauge transformation, to the
holomorphicity condition alone.

Research and Development (R&D) alliances by means of an agent-based model.
Extant research has pointed out that firms select alliance partners considering
both network-related and network-unrelated features (e.g., social capital
versus complementary knowledge stocks). In our agent-based model, firms are
located in a metric knowledge space. The interaction rules incorporate an
exploration phase and a knowledge transfer phase, during which firms search for
a new partner and then evaluate whether they can establish an alliance to
exchange their knowledge stocks. The model parameters determining the overall
system properties are the rate at which alliances form and dissolve and the
agents' interaction radius. Next, we define a novel indicator of performance,
based on the distance traveled by the firms in the knowledge space. Remarkably,
we find that - depending on the alliance formation rate and the interaction
radius - firms tend to cluster around one or more attractors in the knowledge
space, whose position is an emergent property of the system. And, more
importantly, we find that there exists an inverted U-shaped dependence of the
network performance on both model parameters.

are two opposite protrusions, termed ears, such as Kepler's SNR and SNR

formed along an axis. Such a preferred axis can result from a rotating white

organic systems provides us with new insights for the optimal design of
artificial systems. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of excitation energy
transfer (EET) through a complex quantum network by a toy model consisting of
three sites coupled to environments. We study how the coherent evolution and
the noise-induced decoherence work together to reach efficient EET and
illustrate the role of the phase factor attached to the coupling constant in
the EET. By comparing the differences between the Markovian and non-Markovian
dynamics, we discuss the effect of environment and the spatial structure of
system on the dynamics and the efficiency of EET. A intuitive picture is given
to show how the exciton is transferred through the system. Employing the simple
model, we show the robustness of EET efficiency under the influence of the
environment and elucidate the important role of quantum coherence in EET. We go
further to study the quantum feature of the EET dynamics by {\it quantumness}
and show the importance of quantum coherence from a new respect. We calculate
the energy current in the EET and its quantumness, results for different system
parameters are presented and discussed.

Boltzmann Machine (DCRBM) model that combines a discriminative component with
the generative power of CRBMs. Such a combination enables us to uncover
actionable constituents of the ESIPs in two steps. First, we train the DCRBM
model on the labeled data and get accurate (76\%-49\% across various ESIPs)
detection of the predicates. Second, we exploit the generative capability of
DCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data
corresponding to the specific ESIP that closely matches the actual training
data (with mean square error 0.01-0.1 for generating 100 frames). We are thus
able to decompose the ESIPs into their constituent actionable behaviors. Such a
purely computational determination of how to establish an ESIP such as
engagement is unprecedented.

modelling of complex systems. The goal is to achieve a closed form of a large,

Each equation describes the evolution of one ""moment"", a suitable
coarse-grained quantity computable from the full state space. If the system is
too large for analytical and/or numerical methods, then one aims to reduce it
by finding a moment closure relation expressing ""higher-order moments"" in terms

geometric explanation why it has been difficult to rigorously justify many

and the morphisms of the subcategory as those processes that are freely
executable. Via a construction we refer to as parallel-combinable processes
with discarding, we obtain from this data a partially ordered monoid on the set
of processes, with f > g if one can use the free processes to construct g from
f. The structure of this partial order can then be probed using additive
monotones: order-preserving monoid homomorphisms with values in the real
numbers under addition. We first characterise these additive monotones in terms
of the corresponding partitioned process theory.
  Given enough monotones, we might hope to be able to reconstruct the order on
the monoid. If so, we say that we have a complete family of monotones. In
general, however, when we require our monotones to be additive monotones, such
families do not exist or are hard to compute. We show the existence of complete
families of additive monotones for various partitioned process theories based
on the category of finite sets, in order to shed light on the way such families
can be constructed.

moments are oriented perpendicularly to the layers. Using functional integral
techniques we investigate the BCS-like state induced in the bilayer at finite
temperatures. In particular, we determine the critical temperature as a
function of the coupling strength between molecules in different layers and of
the interlayer spacing. By means of Ginzburg-Landau theory we calculate the
superfluid density. We also study the dimerized BEC phase through the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where the effective mass leads to
identify the crossover from BCS to BEC regimes. The possibility of tuning the
effective mass as a direct consequence of the lattice confinement, allows us to
suggest a range of values of the interlayer spacing, which would enable
observing this superfluidity within current experimental conditions.
