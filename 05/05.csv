used to study resonances of $p-$form fields. The resonances are calculated
using the transfer matrix method. The model studied consider the standard RS

The parameters are changed to control the thickness of the smooth brane. With
this a very interesting pattern is found for the resonances. The geometrical

understand exotic properties of condensed matter systems and the
controllability over those states promises unique electronic devices such as a
Mott memory. As a recent example, a ultrafast switching device was demonstrated
using the transition between the correlated Mott insulating state and a
hidden-order metallic state of a layered transition metal dichalcogenides
1T-TaS2. However, the origin of the hidden metallic state was not clear and
only the macroscopic switching by laser pulse and carrier injection was
reported. Here, we demonstrate the nanoscale manipulation of the Mott
insulating state of 1T-TaS2. The electron pulse from a scanning tunneling
microscope switches the insulating phase locally into a metallic phase which is
textured with irregular domain walls in the charge density wave (CDW) order
inherent to this Mott state. The metallic state is a novel correlated phase
near the Mott criticality with a coherent feature at the Fermi energy, which is
induced by the moderate reduction of electron correlation due to the
decoherence in CDW. This work paves the avenue toward novel nanoscale
electronic devices based on correlated electrons.

problem of designing a sparse {\em fault-tolerant} BFS structure, or {\em
FT-BFS } for short, resilient to the failure of up to two edges in the given
undirected unweighted graph $G$, i.e., a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that
subsequent to the failure of up to two edges, the surviving part $H'$ of $H$
still contains a BFS spanning tree for (the surviving part of) $G$. FT-BFS
structures, as well as the related notion of replacement paths, have been
studied so far for the restricted case of a single failure. It has been noted
widely that when concerning shortest-paths in a variety of contexts, there is a
sharp qualitative difference between a single failure and two or more failures.
  Our main results are as follows. We present an algorithm that for every
$n$-vertex unweighted undirected graph $G$ and source node $s$ constructs a
(two edge failure) FT-BFS structure rooted at $s$ with $O(n^{5/3})$ edges. To
provide a useful theory of shortest paths avoiding 2 edges failures, we take a
principled approach to classifying the arrangement these paths. We believe that
the structural analysis provided in this paper may decrease the barrier for
understanding the general case of $f\geq 2$ faults and pave the way to the
future design of $f$-fault resilient structures for $f \geq 2$. We also provide
a matching lower bound, which in fact holds for the general case of $f \geq 1$
and multiple sources $S \subseteq V$. It shows that for every $f\geq 1$, and
integer $1 \leq \sigma \leq n$, there exist $n$-vertex graphs with a source set
$S \subseteq V$ of cardinality $\sigma$ for which any FT-BFS structure rooted
at each $s \in S$, resilient to up to $f$-edge faults has
$\Omega(\sigma^{1/(f+1)} \cdot n^{2-1/(f+1)})$ edges.

of three-dimensional hyperscaling violation black holes. We first note that for
the hyperscaling violation metrics, the scaling of the entropy in term of the
temperature (defined as the effective spatial dimensionality divided by the
dynamical exponent) depends explicitly on the gravity theory. Starting from
this observation, we first explore the case of quadratic curvature gravity
theory for which we derive four classes of asymptotically hyperscaling
violation black holes. For each solution, we compute their masses as well as
those of their soliton counterparts obtained through a double Wick rotation.
Assuming that the partition function has a certain invariance involving the
effective spatial dimensionality, a generalized Cardy formula is derived. This
latter is shown to correctly reproduce the entropy where the ground state is
identified with the soliton. Comparing our formula with the one derived in the
standard Einstein gravity case with source, we stress the role played by the
effective spatial dimensionality. From this observation, we speculate the
general form of the Cardy formula in the case of hyperscaling violation metric
for an arbitrary value of the effective spatial dimensionality. Finally, we
test the viability of this formula in the case of cubic gravity theory.

hand has made tremendous gains in the past few years in terms of scalability
and tractability. Bayesian inference, however, has not had the same level of
success, though a scalable Bayesian approach has its respective strengths,
especially in terms of quantifying uncertainty. To address this gap, we propose
a scalable and flexible novel Bayesian approach for estimation and model
selection in Gaussian undirected graphical models. We first develop a class of
generalized G-Wishart distributions with multiple shape parameters for an
arbitrary underlying graph. This class contains the G-Wishart distribution as a
special case. We then introduce the class of Generalized Bartlett (GB) graphs,
and derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm to obtain posterior draws from
generalized G-Wishart distributions corresponding to a GB graph. The class of
Generalized Bartlett graphs contains the class of decomposable graphs as a
special case, but is substantially larger than the class of decomposable
graphs. We proceed to derive theoretical properties of the proposed Gibbs
sampler. We then demonstrate that the proposed Gibbs sampler is scalable to
significantly higher dimensional problems as compared to using an accept-reject
or a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. Finally, we show the efficacy of the
proposed approach on simulated and real data.

show that in some cases, overtone modes have larger growth rates than the
fundamental mode with the same angular quantum numbers when the black hole is
rapidly rotating. Next, we study the dynamical evolution of the scalar field

valuations from observed data in the generalized second price auction without
relying on the Nash equilibrium assumption. Existing work in Economics on
inferring agent values from data relies on the assumption that all participant
strategies are best responses of the observed play of other players, i.e. they
constitute a Nash equilibrium. In this paper, we show how to perform inference
relying on a weaker assumption instead: assuming that players are using some
form of no-regret learning. Learning outcomes emerged in recent years as an
attractive alternative to Nash equilibrium in analyzing game outcomes, modeling
players who haven't reached a stable equilibrium, but rather use algorithmic
learning, aiming to learn the best way to play from previous observations. In
this paper we show how to infer values of players who use algorithmic learning
strategies. Such inference is an important first step before we move to testing
any learning theoretic behavioral model on auction data. We apply our
techniques to a dataset from Microsoft's sponsored search ad auction system.

resummation to all orders of the terms enhanced by $\log(p_T^H/m_H)$ factors.
Following a recent proposal (Grazzini et al., hep-ph/1306.4581), we argue that
the gluon fusion process, computed considering two active quark flavors, is a
multiscale problem from the point of view of the resummation of the collinear
singular terms. We perform an analysis at parton level of the collinear
behavior of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ real emission amplitudes; relying on
the collinear singularities structure of the latter, we derive an upper limit
to the range of transverse momenta where the collinear approximation is valid.
This scale is then used as the value of the resummation scale in the analytic
resummation framework or as the value of the $h$ parameter in the POWHEG-BOX
code. A variation of this scale can be used to generate an uncertainty band
associated to the matching procedure. Finally, we provide a phenomenological
analysis in the Standard Model, in the Two Higgs Doublet Model and in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In the two latter cases, we provide an
ansatz for the central value of the matching parameters not only for a Standard
Model-like Higgs boson, but also for heavy scalars and in scenarios where the
bottom quark may play the dominant role.

Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS). TDSS is an SDSS-IV eBOSS subproject that
will provide initial identification spectra of approximately 220,000
luminosity-variable objects (variable stars and AGN) across 7,500 square
degrees selected from a combination of SDSS and multi-epoch Pan-STARRS1
photometry. TDSS will be the largest spectroscopic survey to explicitly target
variable objects, avoiding pre-selection on the basis of colors or detailed
modeling of specific variability characteristics. Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)
analysis of our target population performed on SDSS Stripe 82 data suggests our
target sample will be 95% pure (meaning 95% of objects we select have genuine
luminosity variability of a few magnitudes or more). Our final spectroscopic
sample will contain roughly 135,000 quasars and 85,000 stellar variables,
approximately 4,000 of which will be RR Lyrae stars which may be used as outer
Milky Way probes. The variability-selected quasar population has a smoother
redshift distribution than a color-selected sample, and variability
measurements similar to those we develop here may be used to make more uniform
quasar samples in large surveys. The stellar variable targets are distributed
fairly uniformly across color space, indicating that TDSS will obtain spectra
for a wide variety of stellar variables including pulsating variables, stars
with significant chromospheric activity, cataclysmic variables and eclipsing
binaries. TDSS will serve as a pathfinder mission to identify and characterize
the multitude of variable objects that will be detected photometrically in even
larger variability surveys such as LSST.

state to a passive and stabilized state upon touching their neighbors. When two
cells touch, an adhesion link is created between them by means of transmembrane
E-cadherin proteins. Simultaneously, their actin filaments stop polymerizing in
the direction perpendicular to the membrane and reorganize to create an apical
belt that colocalizes with the adhesion links. Here, we propose a detailed
quantitative model of the role of the cytoplasmic $\beta$-catenin and
$\alpha$-catenin proteins in this process, treated as a reaction-diffusion
system. Upon cell-cell contact, the concentration in $\alpha$-catenin dimers
increases, inhibiting actin branching and thereby reducing cellular motility
and expansion pressure. This model provides a mechanism for contact inhibition
that could explain previously unrelated experimental findings on the role
played by E-cadherin, $\beta$-catenin and $\alpha$-catenin in the cellular
phenotype and in tumorigenesis. In particular, we address the effect of a
knockout of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene. Potential

of spectral types K1 and K4 and luminosity class II. The radii of the stars are
$R_1$ = 52.12 $\pm$ 1.38 and $R_2$ = 67.63 $\pm$ 1.40 R$_\odot$ and their

However, the data are also consistent with a light echo $\sim14$ mag fainter

$^{57}$Ni and $^{56}$Ni produced by the explosion, a strong constraint on any
SN Ia explosion model, is $0.043^{+0.012}_{-0.011}$, roughly twice Solar. In
the context of current explosion models, this value favors a progenitor white

$y$-distortion maps to put strong observational limits on the contribution of
the fluctuating part of the $y$-type distortions to the $y$-distortion
monopole. Our bounds are $5.4\times 10^{-8} < \langle y\rangle < 2.2\times
10^{-6}$. Our upper bound is a factor of 6.8 stronger than the currently best
upper $95\%$ confidence limit from COBE-FIRAS of $\langle y\rangle <15\times
10^{-6}$. In the standard cosmology, large scale structure is the only source
of such distortions and our limits therefore constrain the baryonic physics
involved in the formation of the large scale structure. Our lower limit, from
the detected clusters in the Planck and SPT catalogs, also implies that a
Pixie-like experiment should detect the $y$-distortion monopole at
$>27$-$\sigma$. The biggest sources of uncertainty in our upper limit are the
monopole offsets between different HFI channel maps that we estimate to be
$<10^{-6}$.

quadrupole of the $\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic in a manner
similar to conventional multipole fitting methods using the correlation
function as detailed in (Xu et al. 2012). To test the performance of the
$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic we compare our results to those
obtained using the multipoles. The results are in agreement. We also conduct a
brief investigation into some of the possible advantages of using the
$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic for BAO analysis. The
$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ analysis matches the stability of the
multipoles analysis in response to artificially introduced distortions in the
data, without using extra nuisance parameters to improve the fit. When applied
to data with systematics, the $\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic again
matches the performance of fitting the multipoles without using nuisance
parameters. In all the analyzed circumstances, we find that fitting the
$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic removes the requirement for extra

of the Sagittarius (Sgr) streams within the Stripe 82 region, using photometric
and spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The
star formation history (SFH) is determined separately for the bright and faint
Sgr streams, to establish whether both components consist of a similar stellar
population mix or have a distinct origin.
  Best fit SFH solutions are characterised by a well-defined, tight sequence in
age-metallicity space, indicating that star formation occurred within a
well-mixed, homogeneously enriched medium. Star formation rates dropped sharply
at an age of ~5-7 Gyr, possibly related to the accretion of Sgr by the MW.
Finally, the Sgr sequence displays a change of slope in age-metallicity space
at an age between 11-13 Gyr consistent with the Sgr alpha-element knee,
indicating that supernovae type Ia started contributing to the abundance
pattern ~1-3 Gyr after the start of star formation.
  Results for both streams are consistent with being drawn from the parent Sgr
population mix, but at different epochs. The SFH of the bright stream starts
from old, metal-poor populations and extends to a metallicity of [Fe/H]~-0.7,
with peaks at ~7 and 11 Gyr. The faint SFH samples the older, more metal-poor
part of the Sgr sequence, with a peak at ancient ages and stars mostly with
[Fe/H]<-1.3 and age>9 Gyr. Therefore, we argue in favour of a scenario where
the faint stream consists of material stripped i) earlier, and ii) from the
outskirts of the Sgr dwarf.

emission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by Chandra; we find that hot

dominate at E > 1-3 keV. The NuSTAR galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies follow
steep power-law distributions with Gamma ~ 2.6 at E > 5-7 keV, similar to the
spectra of bright individual ULXs and other galaxies that have been studied by
NuSTAR. We find that both NGC 3256 and NGC 3310 have X-ray detected sources
coincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep NuSTAR spectra of both
galaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity AGN or non-AGN in
nature (e.g., ULXs or crowded X-ray sources that reach L2-10 keV ~ 10^40 erg/s
cannot be ruled out). Combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 keV spectra of
NGC 3256 and NGC 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forming
galaxies M83 and NGC 253, we analyze the SFR-normalized spectra of these
starburst galaxies. The spectra of all four galaxies show sharply declining
power-law slopes above 3-6 keV due to ULX populations. Our observations
therefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,
ULXs). This result is similar to the super-Eddington accreting ULXs that have
been studied individually in a targeted NuSTAR ULX program. We also find that
NGC 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of X-ray emission over the other
star-forming galaxies. We argue that the excess is most likely explained by the
relatively low metallicity of the young stellar population in NGC 3310.

driven by different star formation timescales, variations in SFRs, UV
attenuation, nor stochastic effects. This first comparison between CMD-based

a new vector boson coupled to muon minus tau lepton number, $Z'_{\mu - \tau}$,
and emphasizing the prospects at a very large hadron collider with $\sqrt s =$
100 TeV. We also discuss in this case the new contribution to two-lepton

solution to open string field theory. We algebraically construct the solution
of [arXiv:0707.4472] at 6th order in the marginal parameter, and numerically
evaluate the corresponding tachyon profile as well as the action and several
correlation functions containing the equation of motion. We find that the
marginal operator's singular self-OPE is properly regularized and all
quantities we examine are finite. In contrast to the widely studied
time-asymmetric case, the solution depends nontrivially on the strength of the
deformation parameter. For example, we find that the number and period of
oscillations of the tachyon field changes as the strength of the marginal
deformation is increased. We use the recent renormalization scheme of
[arXiv:1412.3466], which contains two free parameters. At finite deformation
parameter the tachyon profile depends on these parameters, while when the
deformation parameter is small, the solution becomes insensitive to them and
behaves like previously studied time-asymmetric rolling tachyon solutions. We
also show that convergence of perturbation series is not as straightforward as
in the time-asymmetric case with regular OPE, and find evidence that it may
depend on the renormalization constants.

located at a projected angular separation of 8.06""+/-0.03"". From low-resolution
optical and near-IR spectroscopy we classified the primary and the companion as
an M7.5+/-0.5 and L7+/-1.5, respectively. The primary shows weaker alkali lines
than field dwarfs of similar spectral type, but still consistent with either a
high-gravity dwarf or a younger object of hundreds of millions of years. The
secondary shows spectral features characteristic for low surface gravity
objects at ages below several hundred Myr, like the triangular shape of the
H-band continuum and alkali lines weaker than in field dwarfs of the same
spectral type. The absence of lithium in the atmosphere of the primary and the
likely membership to the Local Association allowed us to constrain the age of
the system to the range of 150-300 Myr. We report a measurement of the
trigonometric parallax pi=78.8+/-6.4 mas, which translates into a distance of
12.7+/-1.0 pc; the pair thus has a projected physical separation of 102+/-9 AU.
We derived the Lbol of the components and compared them with theoretical
evolutionary models to estimate the masses and effective temperatures. For the
primary, we determined log(Lbol/LSun)=-3.14+/-0.10, and a mass of 73 (+20,-15}

examining the gate-dependent conductance of few-layer (1-5L) WSe2 field effect

dominated by thermionic field emission (TFE) at room temperature, despite the
lack of intentional doping. The TFE process arises due to a large number of
subgap impurity states, the presence of which also leads to high mobility edge
carrier densities. The density of states of such impurity states is
self-consistently determined to be approximately 1-2x10^13 /cm^2/eV in our

active galactic nuclei (AGN). It focuses on new ideas about the origin and
properties of the central obscurer (torus), and the connection with its
surrounding. The review does not address radio unification. AGN tori must be
clumpy but the uncertainties about their properties are still large. Todays
most promising models involve disk winds of various types and hydrodynamical
simulations that link the large scale galactic disk to the inner accretion
flow. IR studies greatly improved the understanding of the spectral energy
distribution of AGNs but they are hindered by various selection effects. X-ray
samples are more complete. A basic relationship which is still unexplained is
the dependence of the torus covering factor on luminosity. There is also much
confusion regarding ""real type-II AGNs"" that do not fit into a simple
unification scheme. The most impressive recent results are due to IR
interferometry, which is not in accord with most torus models, and the accurate
mapping of central ionization cones. AGN unification may not apply to merging

unparalleled means for exploring the universe with its half-arcsecond angular
resolution. Chandra studies have deepened our understanding of galaxy clusters,
active galactic nuclei, galaxies, supernova remnants, planets, and solar system
objects addressing almost all areas of current interest in astronomy and
astrophysics. As we look beyond Chandra, it is clear that comparable or even
better angular resolution with greatly increased photon throughput is essential
to address even more demanding science questions, such as the formation and
subsequent growth of black hole seeds at very high redshift; the emergence of
the first galaxy groups; and details of feedback over a large range of scales
from galaxies to galaxy clusters. Recently, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,
together with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, has initiated a
concept study for such a mission named the X-ray Surveyor. This study starts
with a baseline payload consisting of a high resolution X-ray telescope and an
instrument set which may include an X-ray calorimeter, a wide-field imager and
a dispersive grating spectrometer and readout. The telescope would consist of
highly nested thin shells, for which a number of technical approaches are
currently under development, including adjustable X-ray optics, differential
deposition, and modern polishing techniques applied to a variety of substrates.
In many areas, the mission requirements would be no more stringent than those
of Chandra, and the study takes advantage of similar studies for other large
area missions carried out over the past two decades. Initial assessments
indicate that such an X-ray mission is scientifically compelling, technically
feasible, and worthy of a high rioritization by the next American National
Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey for Astronomy and Astrophysics.

show how SEED can be used in applications ranging from matrix approximation and

more realistic assumptions, leads to a required energy that is orders of
magnitude lower than is claimed in earlier work. We define a core size based on
the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density profile so that it is
insensitive to the functional form used to fit observed data. The energy
required to form a core depends sensitively on the radial scale over which dark
matter within the cusp is redistributed within the halo. Simulations indicate
that within a region of comparable size to the active star forming regions of
the central galaxy that inhabits the halo, dark matter particles have their
orbits radially increased by a factor of 2--3 during core formation. Thus the
inner properties of the dark matter halo, such as halo concentration, and final
core size, set the energy requirements. As a result, the energy cost increases
slowly with halo mass as M$_{\rm{h}}^{0.3-0.7}$ for core sizes $\lesssim1$ kpc.
We use the expected star formation history for a given dark matter halo mass to
predict dwarf galaxy core sizes. We find that supernovae alone would create
well over 4 kpc cores in $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxies \emph{if} 100% of
the energy were transferred to dark matter particle orbits. We can directly
constrain the efficiency factor by studying galaxies with known stellar content
and core size, such as Fornax. We find that the efficiency of coupling between
stellar feedback and dark matter orbital energy need only be at the 1% level or
less to explain Fornax's 1 kpc core.

graph-formalism for conditional temporal planning. It offers a more flexible
formalism than the equivalent CSTP model of Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack,
from which it was derived mainly as a sound formalization. Three notions of
consistency arise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic
consistency is the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging
and it was conjectured to be hard to assess. Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack
gave a doubly-exponential time algorithm for deciding whether a CSTN is
dynamically-consistent and to produce, in the positive case, a dynamic
execution strategy of exponential size. In the present work we offer a proof
that deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent is coNP-hard and provide
the first singly-exponential time algorithm for this problem, also producing a
dynamic execution strategy whenever the input CSTN is dynamically-consistent.
The algorithm is based on a novel connection with Mean Payoff Games, a family
of two-player combinatorial games on graphs well known for having applications
in model-checking and formal verification. The presentation of such connection
is mediated by the Hyper Temporal Network model, a tractable generalization of
Simple Temporal Networks whose consistency checking is equivalent to
determining Mean Payoff Games. In order to analyze the algorithm we introduce a
refined notion of dynamic-consistency, named \epsilon-dynamic-consistency, and
present a sharp lower bounding analysis on the critical value of the reaction
time \hat{\varepsilon} where the CSTN transits from being, to not being,
dynamically-consistent. The proof technique introduced in this analysis of
\hat{\varepsilon} is applicable more in general when dealing with linear

account this result, and other recent surveys at Parkes, we corrected for
detection sensitivities based on the search software used in the analyses and
the different backends used in these surveys and find that the all-sky FRB

challenge for neuroscience. In particular, the self-organized behavioral
development provides more questions than answers. Are there special functional
units for curiosity, motivation, and creativity? This paper argues that these
features can be grounded in synaptic plasticity itself, without requiring any
higher level constructs. We propose differential extrinsic plasticity (DEP) as
a new synaptic rule for self-learning systems and apply it to a number of
complex robotic systems as a test case. Without specifying any purpose or goal,
seemingly purposeful and adaptive behavior is developed, displaying a certain
level of sensorimotor intelligence. These surprising results require no system
specific modifications of the DEP rule but arise rather from the underlying
mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the tight
brain-body-environment coupling. The new synaptic rule is biologically
plausible and it would be an interesting target for a neurobiolocal
investigation. We also argue that this neuronal mechanism may have been a
catalyst in natural evolution.

multiple simultaneous observations at 1.5, 2.0, and 8.9 GHz, allowing us to
examine the magnetar's flux evolution, radio spectrum, and interstellar medium
parameters (such as the dispersion measure (DM), the scattering timescale and
its index). During two epochs, we have simultaneous observations from the
Chandra X-ray Observatory, which permitted the absolute alignment of the radio
and X-ray profiles. As with the two other radio magnetars with published
alignments, the radio profile lies within the broad peak of the X-ray profile,
preceding the X-ray profile maximum by $\sim$0.2 rotations. We also find that
the radio spectral index $\gamma$ is significantly negative between $\sim$2 and
9 GHz; during the final $\sim$30 days of our observations $\gamma \sim -1.4$,
which is typical of canonical pulsars. The radio flux has not decreased during
this outburst, whereas the long-term trends in the other radio magnetars show
concomitant fading of the radio and X-ray fluxes. Finally, our wideband
measurements of the DMs taken in adjacent frequency bands in tandem are
stochastically inconsistent with one another. Based on recent theoretical
predictions, we consider the possibility that the dispersion measure is
frequency-dependent. Despite having several properties in common with the other
radio magnetars, such as $L_{\textrm{X,qui}}/L_{\textrm{rot}} \lesssim 1$, an
increase in the radio flux during the X-ray flux decay has not been observed
thus far in other systems.

important model from statistical mechanics which describes a system of
interacting particles hopping left and right on a one-dimensional lattice with
open boundaries. It has been known for awhile that there is a tight connection
between the partition function of the ASEP and moments of Askey-Wilson

hierarchy of classical orthogonal polynomials in one variable. On the other
hand, Askey-Wilson polynomials can be viewed as a specialization of the

polynomials), which in turn give rise to the Macdonald polynomials associated
to any classical root system via a limit or specialization. In light of the
fact that Koornwinder polynomials generalize the Askey-Wilson polynomials, it
is natural to ask whether one can find a particle model whose partition
function is related to Koornwinder polynomials. In this article we answer this

aspect of the cost optimization problem. As a result, they fail to analyze
scenarios when the interconnected components along with their properties have
to be considered simultaneously. The proposed model combines these partial
models into a single unified cost optimization model. Therefore, it is able to
analyze scenarios which are closer to practical implementation. Furthermore, it
is useful to analyze the behavior of a population (e.g., smart buildings, smart
cities, etc.) and properties of the components for specific scenarios (e.g.,
the impact of aggregate storage capacity, etc.). It allows energy trading in
microgrid which introduces a cost fairness problem. It ensures Pareto
optimality among the households which guarantees that no household will be
worse off to improve the cost of others. Results show that it can maintain the
user preferences and can react to a demand response program by rescheduling the
household loads and sources. Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of the
computational complexity of the proposed model, showing that solution time
increases exponentially with the problem size and proposes possible approaches
to solve this.

observed close to active sites of star formation, but not within outflows, can
trace turbulent dissipation of shocks stirred by formation processes. Although
the transitions are difficult to detect at individual positions, our

formation: Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), High-mass protostellar object (HMPOs),
and Ultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs). IRDCs were divided into `quiescent IRDC
cores' and `active IRDC cores', depending on star formation activity. The
HCN/HNC ratio is known to be higher at active and high temperature regions
related to ongoing star formation, compared to cold and quiescent regions. Our
observations toward 8 quiescent IRDC cores, 16 active IRDC cores, 23 HMPOs, and
31 UCHIIs show consistent results; the ratio is 0.97~($\pm~0.10$),
2.65~($\pm~0.88$), 4.17~($\pm~1.03$) and 8.96~($\pm~3.32$) in these respective

of the HCN/HNC abundance ratio, therefore, seems directly associated with the
evolutionary stages of star formation, which have different temperatures. One
suggested explanation for this trend is the conversion of HNC to HCN, which
occurs effectively at higher temperatures. To test the explanation, we
performed a simple chemical model calculation. In order to fit the observed
results, the energy barrier of the conversion must be much lower than the value

The proposed method uses a time-domain cancellation in a DF relay, where a

that single event upset (SEU) could occur in a CMOS under neutron exposure. In
this paper the rectangular parallelepiped (RPP) method is used to investigate
the SEU response of a typical CMOS. SEU induced by 1$\sim$14\:MeV neutrons are

that only in the structure with W, secondary particle $\alpha$ is created and
SEUs are generated when the energy of neutron is less than $4$\:MeV.

belongs to one of $K$ different populations is considered. Evolution equation
for a particle from population $k$ depends on the $K$ empirical measures of
particle states corresponding to the various populations and the form of this
dependence may change from one population to another. In addition, the drift
coefficients in the particle evolution equations may depend on a factor that is
common to all particles and which is described through the solution of a
stochastic differential equation coupled, through the empirical measures, with
the $N$-particle dynamics. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior as
$N\to \infty$. Although the full system is not exchangeable, particles in the
same population have an exchangeable distribution. Using this structure, one
can prove using standard techniques a law of large numbers result and a
propagation of chaos property. In the current work we study fluctuations about
the law of large number limit. For the case where the common factor is absent
the limit is given in terms of a Gaussian field whereas in the presence of a
common factor it is characterized through a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
We also obtain, as a corollary, new fluctuation results for disjoint
sub-families of single type particle systems, i.e. when $K=1$. Finally, we
establish limit theorems for multi-type statistics of such weakly interacting

successfully coupled light into microdisk efficiently, most of them suffer from
the ultrahigh sensitivity to the environmental vibration. Here we demonstrate a
robust mechanism, which is termed as end-fire injection. By connecting an input
waveguide to a circular microdisk directly, the mechanism shows that light can
be efficiently coupled into optical microcavity. The coupling efficiency can be
as high as 0.75 when the input signals are on resonances. Our numerical results
reveal that the high coupling efficiency is attributed to the constructive
interference between the whispering gallery modes and the input signals. We
have also shown that the end-fire injection can be further extended to the
long-lived resonances with low refractive index such as n = 1.45. We believe

observations are frequently encountered. To facilitate the computational
process, a divide-and-conquer scheme is often used for the analysis of big
data. In such a strategy, a full dataset is first split into several manageable
segments; the final output is then averaged from the individual outputs of the
segments. Despite its popularity in practice, it remains largely unknown that
whether such a distributive strategy provides valid theoretical inferences to
the original data. In this paper, we address this fundamental issue for the
distributed kernel regression (DKR), where the algorithmic feasibility is
measured by the generalization performance of the resulting estimator. To
justify DKR, a uniform convergence rate is needed for bounding the
generalization error over the individual outputs, which brings new and
challenging issues in the big data setup. Under mild conditions, we show that,
with a proper number of segments, DKR leads to an estimator that is
generalization consistent to the unknown regression function. The obtained
results justify the method of DKR and shed light on the feasibility of using
other distributed algorithms for processing big data. The promising preference
of the method is supported by both simulation and real data examples.

with teachers to enhance their cognitive skills. As adults, they then choose to
become workers, managers, or teachers, who match in the labor or educational
market to earn wages by producing output. We study the competitive equilibrium
which results from the steady state requirement that the educational process
replicate the same endogenous distribution of cognitive skills among adults in
each generation (assuming the same distribution of student skills). We show
such an equilibrium can be found by solving an infinite-dimensional linear
program and its dual. We analyze the structure of our solutions, and give
sufficient conditions for them to be unique. Whether or not the educational
matching is positive assortative turns out to depend on convexity of the
equilibrium wages as a function of ability, suitably parameterized; we identity
conditions which imply this convexity. Moreover, due to the recursive nature of
the education market, it is a priori conceivable that a pyramid scheme leads to
greater and greater discrepancies in the wages of the most talented teachers at
the top of the market. Assuming each teacher teaches $N$ students, and
contributes a fraction $\theta \in]0,1[$ to their cognitive skill, we show a
phase transition occurs at $N\theta=1$, which determines whether or not the

fundamental geometric optimization problem involving coordinating the motion of
vehicles through an intersection.
  We are given a set of $n$ vehicles in the plane, each modeled as a unit
length line segment that moves monotonically, either horizontally or
vertically, subject to a maximum speed limit. Each vehicle is described by a
start and goal position and a start time and deadline. The question is whether,
subject to the speed limit, there exists a collision-free motion plan so that
each vehicle travels from its start position to its goal position prior to its
deadline.
  We present three results. We begin by showing that this problem is
NP-complete with a reduction from 3-SAT. Second, we consider a constrained
version in which cars traveling horizontally can alter their speeds while cars
traveling vertically cannot. We present a simple algorithm that solves this
problem in $O(n \log n)$ time. Finally, we provide a solution to the discrete
version of the problem and prove its asymptotic optimality in terms of the
maximum delay of a vehicle.

Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the

pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species.
Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially
resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the
expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other
prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation
fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially
with CO and N$_2$) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of
HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are
statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation
can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of solid mass
resides in a component that has grown into decimeter size scales inside the
dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile
condensation, dust coagulation and settling.

exploring in particular the relationship between CME initial speeds and transit
times. The initial speed of a CME is obtained by fitting the CME with the
Graduated Cylindrical Shell model and is thus free of projection effects. We
then use the drag force model to fit results of the transit time versus the
initial speed. By adopting different drag regimes, i.e., the viscous,
aerodynamics, and hybrid regimes, we get similar results, with the least mean
estimation error of the hybrid model of 12.9 hours. CMEs with a propagation
angle (the angle between the propagation direction and the Sun-Earth line)
larger than its half angular width arrive at the Earth with an angular
deviation caused by factors other than the radial solar wind drag. The drag
force model cannot be well applied to such events. If we exclude these events
in the sample, the prediction accuracy can be improved, i.e., the estimation
error reduces to 6.8 hours. This work suggests that it is viable to predict the
arrival time of CMEs at the Earth based on the initial parameters with a fairly
good accuracy. Thus, it provides a method of space weather forecast of 1--5
days following the occurrence of CMEs.

of food pairing which examines compatibility of two ingredients in a recipe in
terms of their shared flavor compounds. Food pairing was enumerated at the
level of cuisine, recipes as well as ingredient pairs by quantifying flavor
sharing between pairs of ingredients. Our results indicate that each regional
cuisine follows negative food pairing pattern; more the extent of flavor
sharing between two ingredients, lesser their co-occurrence in that cuisine. We
find that frequency of ingredient usage is central in rendering the
characteristic food pairing in each of these cuisines. Spice and dairy emerged
as the most significant ingredient classes responsible for the biased pattern
of food pairing. Interestingly while individual spices contribute to negative
food pairing, dairy products on the other hand tend to deviate food pairing
towards positive side. Our data analytical study highlighting statistical
properties of the regional cuisines, brings out their culinary fingerprints
that could be used to design algorithms for generating novel recipes and recipe

be due to the interaction between winds launched from the hot accretion flow in
Sgr A* and the interstellar medium (ISM). In that work, we focus only on the
morphology. In this paper we continue our study by calculating the gamma-ray
radiation. Some cosmic ray protons (CRp) and electrons must be contained in the
winds, which are likely formed by physical processes such as magnetic
reconnection. We have performed MHD simulations to study the spatial
distribution of CRp, considering the advection and diffusion of CRp in the
presence of magnetic field. We find that a permeated zone is formed just
outside of the contact discontinuity between winds and ISM, where the
collisions between CRp and thermal nuclei mainly occur. The decay of neutral
pions generated in the collisions, combined with the inverse Compton scattering
of background soft photons by the secondary leptons generated in the collisions
and primary CR electrons can well explain the observed gamma-ray spectral
energy distribution. Other features such as the uniform surface brightness
along the latitude and the boundary width of the bubbles are also explained.
The advantage of this accretion wind model is that the adopted wind properties
come from the detailed small scale MHD numerical simulation of accretion flows
and the value of mass accretion rate has independent observational evidences.
The success of the model suggests that we may seriously consider the

the magnetoresistance (MR) of the W/CoFeB/MgO structures and its correlation to
the current-induced torque to the magnetization. We observe that the MR is
independent of the angle between magnetization and current direction, but is
determined by the relative magnetization orientation with respect to the spin

so-called spin Hall magnetoresistance. The MR of ~1% in W/CoFeB/MgO samples is
considerably larger than those in other structures of Ta/CoFeB/MgO or

similar W thickness dependence of the MR and the current-induced magnetization
switching efficiency demonstrates that they share the same underlying physics,

continuous-time analog of the well-known vector ARMA(p,q) processes. They have
attracted interest over the last years. Methods to estimate the parameters of
an MCARMA process require an identifiable parametrization such as the Echelon
form with a fixed Kronecker index, which is in the one-dimensional case the
degree p of the autoregressive polynomial. Thus, the Kronecker index has to be
known in advance before the parameter estimation is done. When this is not the
case information criteria can be used to estimate the Kronecker index and the
degrees (p,q), respectively. In this paper we investigate information criteria
for MCARMA processes based on quasi maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore,
we first derive the asymptotic properties of quasi maximum likelihood
estimators for MCARMA processes in a misspecified parameter space. Then, we
present necessary and sufficient conditions for information criteria to be
strongly and weakly consistent, respectively. In particular, we study the
well-known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information

to changes within the system or in its execution environment. The fulfillment
of the system requirements needs to be guaranteed even in the presence of
adverse conditions and adaptations. Thus, a key challenge for self-adaptive
software systems is assurance. Traditionally, confidence in the correctness of
a system is gained through a variety of activities and processes performed at
development time, such as design analysis and testing. In the presence of
selfadaptation, however, some of the assurance tasks may need to be performed
at runtime. This need calls for the development of techniques that enable
continuous assurance throughout the software life cycle. Fundamental to the
development of runtime assurance techniques is research into the use of models
at runtime (M@RT). This chapter explores the state of the art for usingM@RT to
address the assurance of self-adaptive software systems. It defines what
information can be captured by M@RT, specifically for the purpose of assurance,
and puts this definition into the context of existing work. We then outline key
research challenges for assurance at runtime and characterize assurance

areas where M@RT could provide significant benefits beyond existing assurance

neutron diffraction techniques in the temperature range 300 - 1100 K. Detailed
Rietveld analyses of thermo-diffractograms show a variety of structural phase
transitions ranging from non-polar antiferrodistortive to ferroelectric in
nature. In the temperature range of 525 K to 675 K, unambiguous experimental
evidence is shown for phase coexistence of orthorhombic paraelectric O1 phase
(space group Cmcm) and orthorhombic ferroelectric O2 phase (space group Pmc21).
The bp primitive lattice parameter of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase (O2
phase) decreases, while the ap and cp primitive lattice parameters show normal
increase with increase in temperature. Above 675 K, in the O1 phase, all
lattice parameters come close to each other and increase continuously with
increase of temperature, and around 925 K, ap parameter approaches bp parameter
and thus the sample undergoes an orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition.
Further as temperature increases, the cp lattice parameter decreases, and
finally approaches to ap parameter, and the sample transform into the cubic
phase. The continuous change in the lattice parameters reveals that the
successive phase transformations from orthorhombic O1 to high temperature
tetragonal phase and finally to the cubic phase are not of a strong first order
type in nature. We argue that application of chemical pressure as a result of
Li substitution in NaNbO3 matrix, favours the freezing of zone centre phonons
over the zone boundary phonons that are known to freeze in pure NaNbO3 as

Forty-nine individuals among interns, PhD students, researchers, and professors

and qualitative responses suggested that there is still work needed in terms of
advocating green open access to computer science authors who seldom

described in terms of the Schwinger-Keldysh functional integral formalism,
whose action conveniently encodes the information about the dynamics. We show
here that the action of quantum systems evolving in thermal equilibrium is
invariant under a symmetry transformation which distinguishes them from generic
open systems. A unitary or dissipative dynamics having this symmetry naturally
leads to the emergence of a Gibbs thermal stationary state. Moreover, the
fluctuation-dissipation relations characterizing the linear response of an
equilibrium system to external perturbations can be derived as the
Ward-Takahashi identities associated with this symmetry. Accordingly, the
latter provides an efficient check for the onset of thermodynamic equilibrium
and it makes testing the validity of fluctuation-dissipation relations
unnecessary. In the classical limit, this symmetry renders the one which is

ubiquitously in computational geometry. Common algorithms to construct the
convex hull on a finite set of n points (x,y) range from O(nlogn) time to O(n)
time. However, it is often the case that a heuristic procedure is applied to
reduce the original set of n points to a set of s < n points which contains the
hull and so accelerates the final hull finding procedure. We present an
algorithm to precondition data before building a 2D convex hull with integer
coordinates, with three distinct advantages. First, for all practical purposes,
it is linear; second, no explicit sorting of data is required and third, the
reduced set of s points is constructed such that it forms an ordered set that
can be directly pipelined into an O(n) time convex hull algorithm. Under these
criteria a fast (or O(n)) pre-conditioner in principle creates a fast convex
hull (approximately O(n)) for an arbitrary set of points. The paper empirically
evaluates and quantifies the acceleration generated by the method against the
most common convex hull algorithms. An extra acceleration of at least four
times when compared to previous existing preconditioning methods is found from
experiments on a dataset.

used to model friction, feedback devices or self-propulsion. Such forces
usually include a dissipative component which conceals the fast energy
exchanges with a thermostat at the environment temperature $T$, ruled by a
microscopic Hamiltonian $H$. The mapping $(H,T) \to F(v)$ - even if effective
for many purposes - may lead to applications of stochastic thermodynamics where
an $incomplete$ fluctuating entropy production (FEP) is derived. An
enlightening example is offered by recent macroscopic experiments where
dissipation is dominated by solid-on-solid friction, typically modelled through
a deterministic Coulomb force $F(v)$. Through an adaptation of the microscopic
Prandtl-Tomlinson model for friction, we show how the FEP is dominated by the
heat released to the $T$-thermostat, ignored by the macroscopic Coulomb model.
This problem, which haunts several studies in the literature, cannot be cured
by weighing the time-reversed trajectories with a different auxiliary dynamics:
it is only solved by a more accurate stochastic modelling of the thermostat
underlying dissipation.

while in the high-frequency radio light curves prominent radio outbursts are
visible peaking at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2013, revealing a complex
radio-optical correlation. Cross-correlation analysis suggests a delay of the
optical variations after the gamma-ray ones of about a month, which is a
peculiar behaviour in blazars. We also analyse optical polarimetric and
spectroscopic data. The average polarization percentage P is less than 3 per
cent, but it reaches about 19 per cent during the early stage of the 2012-2013

preferred electric vector polarisation angle and during the outburst the linear
polarization vector shows wide rotations in both directions, suggesting a
complex behaviour or structure of the jet and possible turbulence. The analysis
of 140 optical spectra acquired at the Steward Observatory reveals a strong Mg

It gives a vanishing contribution only when the inclinations of the body

not vanish and can reach up to about 2.4 m/s for an asteroid such as 2 Pallas

codes is presented. Based on this technique, three explicit constructions of
MSR codes are given. The first two constructions provide access-optimal MSR
codes, with two and three parities, respectively, which attain the
sub-packetization bound for access-optimal codes. The third construction
provides longer MSR codes with three parities, which are not access-optimal,
and do not necessarily attain the sub-packetization bound.
  In addition to a minimum storage in a node, all three constructions allow the
entire data to be recovered from a minimal number of storage nodes. That is,
given storage $\ell$ in each node, the entire stored data can be recovered from
any $2\log_2 \ell$ for 2 parity nodes, and either $3\log_3\ell$ or
$4\log_3\ell$ for 3 parity nodes. Second, in the first two constructions, a
helper node accesses the minimum number of its symbols for repair of a failed
node (access-optimality). The generator matrix of these codes is based on
perfect matchings of complete graphs and hypergraphs, and on a rational
canonical form of matrices. The goal of this paper is to provide a construction
of such optimal codes over the smallest possible finite fields. For two
parities, the field size is reduced by a factor of two for access-optimal codes
compared to previous constructions. For three parities, in the first
construction the field size is $6\log_3 \ell+1$ (or $3\log_3 \ell+1$ for fields
with characteristic 2), and in the second construction the field size is
larger, yet linear in $\log_3\ell$. Both constructions with 3 parities provide
a significant improvement over existing previous works, since only non-explicit

pair+triple semi-empirical potentials (up to 100 GPa). Zero-point vibrations
have been treated in the Debye approximation assuming $^4$He isotope (we
exclude the quantum-crystal region at very low pressures from consideration).
Both methods give a reasonable agreement with the available experimental data.
Our calculations predict significant elastic anisotropy of helium ($\triangle P
\approx 1.14$, $\triangle S_1 \approx 1.7$, $\triangle S_2 \approx 0.93$ at low
pressures). Under terapascal pressures helium becomes more elastically
isotropic. At the metallization point there is a sharp feature in the elastic
modulus $C_S$, which is the stiffness with respect to the isochoric change of
the $c/a$ ratio. This is connected with the previously obtained sharp minimum
of the $c/a$ ratio at the metallization point.
  Our calculations confirm the previously measured decrease of the Poisson's
ratio with increasing pressure. This is not a quantum effect, as the same sign
of the pressure effect was obtained when we disregarded zero-point vibrations.
At TPa pressures Poisson's ratio reaches the value of $0.31$ at the theoretical
metallization point ($V_{mol}=0.228$ cm$^3$/mol, $p=17.48$ TPa) and $0.29$ at

simulations of non-equilibrium over-pressured relativistic jets in cylindrical
geometry. Multiple stationary recollimation shock and rarefaction structures
are produced along the jet by the nonlinear interaction of shocks and
rarefaction waves excited at the interface between the jet and the surrounding
ambient medium. Although initially the jet is kinematically dominated, we have
considered axial, toroidal and helical magnetic fields to investigate the
effects of different magnetic-field topologies and strengths on the
recollimation structures. We find that an axial field introduces a larger
effective gas-pressure and leads to stronger recollimation shocks and
rarefactions, resulting in larger flow variations. The jet boost grows
quadratically with the initial magnetic field. On the other hand, a toroidal
field leads to weaker recollimation shocks and rarefactions, modifying
significantly the jet structure after the first recollimation rarefaction and
shock. The jet boost decreases systematically. For a helical field, instead,
the behaviour depends on the magnetic pitch, with a phenomenology that ranges
between the one seen for axial and toroidal magnetic fields, respectively. In
general, however, a helical magnetic field yields a more complex shock and
rarefaction substructure close to the inlet that significantly modifies the jet
structure. The differences in shock structure resulting from different field
configurations and strengths may have observable consequences for disturbances
propagating through a stationary recollimation shock.

extraterrestrial neutrino candidates detected as track-like events. Using 70
months of Fermi-LAT observations, a likelihood analysis of all $1-300$ GeV
photons within 5 degrees of the track-like neutrino candidates' origin was
undertaken, to search for spatially coincident $\gamma$-ray emission. One of
IceCube's HESE track events was found to be spatially coincident with a
$\gamma$-ray bright active galactic nucleus (AGN), PKS 0723-008. We find
however, that the chance probability for Fermi-LAT detected AGN to be spatially
coincident with a single HESE track-like event is high ($\sim37$\%). We
therefore find no evidence of $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the
detection of IceCube's HESE track-like neutrino candidates. Upper limits were
calculated in the energy range of $1-300$ GeV, assuming a point source origin
for the neutrino events considered. The implications for the non-detection of
$\gamma$-ray emission from the source of the HESE track-like events are briefly
discussed.
  The large time period analysed in our study did however, reveal two new
$\gamma$-ray point sources. With a flux of ($1.28 \pm 0.08$) $\times 10^{-9}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, in the $1-300$ GeV energy range, and an associated
TS value of 220.6, one of these new point sources is positionally coincident
with the AGN PKS 1346-112. The other point source has a $1-300$ GeV flux of

the astrophysical properties of the Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter halos
that could provide clear observational signatures that help discriminate
between different dark matter models. In the Bose-Einstein condensation model
dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, gravitationally confined
Newtonian gas, whose density and pressure are related by a polytropic equation
of state with index $n=1$. The mass and gravitational properties of the
condensate halos are obtained in a systematic form, including the mean
logarithmic slopes of the density and of the tangential velocity. The lensing
properties of the condensate dark matter are investigated in detail. In
particular, a general analytical formula for the surface density, an important
quantity that defines the lensing properties of a dark matter halos, is
obtained in the form of series expansions. This enables arbitrary-precision
calculations of the surface mass density, deflection angle, deflection
potential, and of the magnification factor, thus giving the possibility of the
comparison of the predicted lensing properties of the condensate dark matter
halos with observations. The stability properties of the condensate halos are
also investigated by using the scalar and the tensor virial theorems,
respectively, and the virial perturbation equation for condensate dark matter
halos is derived.

witnessed the growth of new Anycast-enabled Content Delivery Networks (A-CDNs)
such as CloudFlare and EdgeCast, which provide their web services (i.e., TCP
traffic) entirely through anycast.
  To the best of our knowledge, little is known in the literature about the
nature and the dynamic of such traffic. For instance, since anycast depends on
the routing, the question is how stable are the paths toward the nearest
server. To bring some light on this question, in this work we provide a first
look at A-CDNs traffic by combining active and passive measurements. In
particular, building upon our previous work, we use active measurements to
identify and geolocate A-CDNs caches starting from a large set of IP addresses
related to the top-100k Alexa websites. We then look at the traffic of those
caches in the wild using a large passive dataset collected from a European ISP.
  We find that several A-CDN servers are encountered on a daily basis when
browsing the Internet. Routes to A-CDN servers are very stable, with few
changes that are observed on a monthly-basis (in contrast to more the dynamic
traffic policies of traditional CDNs). Overall, A-CDNs are a reality worth
further investigations.

with desired 3 dB beamwidths, resulting in a nonconvex quadratically
constrained quadratic program which is NP-hard. A semidefinite program and a

Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we obtained high-resolution
CO(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with HST/WFPC2 imaging
and WHT long-slit spectroscopy. We find that, while roughly M(H2) ~ 2 x
10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,
another M(H2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of
~60 kpc. Most of this widespread CO(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidal
features visible in the rest-frame near-UV HST/WFPC2 imaging. Ly$\alpha$
emission shows an excess over HeII, but a deficiency over L(IR), which is
likely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured star
formation that was triggered by the merger. In terms of feedback, the radio
source is aligned with widespread CO(1-0) emission, which suggests that there
is a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of cold
molecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. Its optical appearance, combined
with the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of MRC
0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `Dragonfly Galaxy'.

dwarf galaxies orbiting a Milky Way-like host, a process known to lead to the
formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We focus on the effect of the
orientation of the dwarf galaxy disk's angular momentum with respect to the
orbital one and find very strong dependence of the evolution on this parameter.
We consider four different orientations: the exactly prograde, the exactly
retrograde and two intermediate ones. Tidal evolution is strongest for the
exactly prograde and weakest for the exactly retrograde orbit. In the prograde
case the stellar component forms a strong bar and remains prolate until the end
of the simulation, while its rotation is very quickly replaced by random
motions of the stars. In the retrograde case the dwarf remains oblate, does not
form a bar and loses rotation very slowly. In the two cases of intermediate
orientation of the disk, the evolution is between the two extremes, suggesting
a monotonic dependence on the inclination. We interpret the results in terms of
the resonance between the angular velocity of the stars in the dwarf and its
orbital motion by comparing the measurements from simulations to semi-analytic
predictions. We conclude that resonant effects are the most important mechanism
underlying the tidal evolution of disky dwarf galaxies.

Since commuting diagrams of arrows of ordinary categories may be conceived as

operation of juncture has a connection with proof theory, where it corresponds
to a kind of cut rule on sequents, and it is related also to an operation on
which the notion of operad can be based. The main achievement of the work is a
detailed description of the specific planarity involved in juncture and graphs

huge unlicensed optical spectrum and low operational costs. The corresponding
performance analysis of FSO systems over turbulence channels is very limited,
especially when using multiple apertures at both transmitter and receiver
sides. This paper aim to provide the ergodic capacity characterization of
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems over atmospheric
turbulence-induced fading channels. The fluctuations of the irradiance of
optical channels distorted by atmospheric conditions is usually described by a
gamma-gamma ($\Gamma \Gamma$) distribution, and the distribution of the sum of
$\Gamma \Gamma$ random variables (RVs) is required to model the MIMO optical
links. We use an $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution to efficiently approximate the
probability density function (PDF) of the sum of independent and identical
distributed $\Gamma\Gamma$ RVs through moment-based estimators. Furthermore,
the PDF of the sum of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed
$\Gamma \Gamma$ RVs can be efficiently approximated by a finite weighted sum of
PDFs of $\Gamma \Gamma$ distributions. Based on these reliable approximations,
novel and precise analytical expressions for the ergodic capacity of MIMO FSO
systems are derived. Additionally, we deduce the asymptotic simple expressions
in high signal-to-noise ratio regimes, which provide useful insights into the
impact of the system parameters on the ergodic capacity. Finally, our proposed
results are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.

evolution. In it, agents obtain information about their (common) environment by
the perception of messages of other agents, which is determined by an
interaction probability (the structure of the population). For an agent to
understand another agent's messages, the former must either know the identity
of the latter, or the code producing the messages must be universally
interpretable. A universal code, however, introduces a vulnerability: a
parasitic entity can take advantage of it. Here, we investigate this problem.
In our specific setting, we consider a parasite to be an agent that tries to
inflict as much damage as possible in the mutual understanding of the
population (i.e. the parasite acts as a disinformation agent). We show that,
after introducing a parasite in the population, the former adopts a code such
that it captures the information about the environment that is missing in the
population. Such agent would be of great value, but only if the rest of the
population could understand its messages. However, it is of little use here,
since the parasite utilises the most common messages in the population to
express different concepts. Now we let the population respond by updating their
codes such that, in this arms race, they again maximise their mutual
understanding. As a result, there is a code drift in the population where the
utilisation of the messages of the parasite is avoided. A consequence of this
is that the information that the parasite possesses but the agents lack becomes
understandable and readily available.

the possibility that the top-Yukawa and the $ttHH$ couplings involved can be CP

coefficients of the square or the 4th power of each coupling $(g_t^{S,P},
\lambda_{3H}, g_{tt}^{S,P})$ at various stages of cuts, such that the desired

curvature to twisted Dirac spectral triples constructed out of Heisenberg
bimodules that implement the Morita equivalence of the $C^*$-algebra $A_\theta
= C(T^2_\theta)$ with other toric algebras $A_{\theta'}$. In the enlarged
context the conformal metric on $T^2_\theta$ is exchanged with an arbitrary
Hermitian metric on the Heisenberg $(A_\theta, A_{\theta'})$-bimodule $E'$ for
which ${\rm End}_{A_{\theta'}}(E') = A_\theta $. We prove that the Ray-Singer
log-determinant of the corresponding Laplacian, viewed as a functional on the
space of all Hermitian metrics on $E'$, attains its extremum at the unique
Hermitian metric whose corresponding connection has constant curvature. The
gradient of the log-determinant functional gives rise to a noncommutative
analogue of the Gaussian curvature. The genuinely new outcome of this paper is
that the latter is shown to be independent of any Heisenberg bimodule $E'$ such
that $A_\theta = {\rm End}_{A_{\theta'}}(E')$, and in this sense it is Morita
invariant. To prove the above results we extend Connes' pseudodifferential
calculus to Heisenberg modules. The twisted version, which offers more
flexibility even in the case of trivial coefficients, could potentially be
applied to other problems in the elliptic theory on noncommutative tori. A
noteworthy technical feature is that we systematize the computation of the
resolvent expansion for elliptic differential operators on noncommutative tori

is a Jacobi matrix the a.c. spectrum remains perfectly the same. Moreover,
Killip and Simon described explicitly the spectral properties for such A+B.
Jointly with Damanik they generalized this result to the case of perturbations
of periodic Jacobi matrices. Recall that the spectrum of a periodic Jacobi
matrix is a system of intervals of a very specific nature. Christiansen, Simon
and Zinchenko posed the following question: ""is there an extension of the
Damanik-Killip-Simon theorem to the general finite system of intervals case?""
Here we solve this problem completely. Our method deals with the Jacobi flow on
GMP matrices. GMP (an abbreviation for Generalized Moment Problem) matrices are
probably a new object in the spectral theory (a very close relative of Jacobi
and CMV matrices). The Jacobi flow on them is also a probably new member of the
rich family of integrable systems. An ideology of analytic vector bundles plays
an essential role in our construction.

unclear. The polarization state of the radiation is an observational parameter
which brings key additional information about the physical process. This is why
most of the projects for the next generation of space missions covering the
tens of keV to the MeV region require a polarization measurement capability. A
key element enabling this capability is a detector system allowing the
identification and characterization of Compton interactions as they are the
main process at play. The hard X-ray imaging spectrometer module, developed in
CEA with the generic name of Caliste module, is such a detector. In this paper,
we present experimental results for two types of Caliste-256 modules, one based
on a CdTe crystal, the other one on a CdZnTe crystal, which have been exposed
to linearly polarized beams at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.
These results, obtained at 200-300 keV, demonstrate their capability to give an
accurate determination of the polarization parameters (polarization angle and
fraction) of the incoming beam. Applying a selection to our data set,
equivalent to select 90 degrees Compton scattered interactions in the detector
plane, we find a modulation factor Q of 0.78. The polarization angle and
fraction are derived with accuracies of approximately 1 degree and 5%. The
modulation factor remains larger than 0.4 when essentially no selection is made
at all on the data. These results prove that the Caliste-256 modules have
performances allowing them to be excellent candidates as detectors with
polarimetric capabilities, in particular for future space missions.

Clusters of the resulting network are treated as nodes at the next hierarchy

hierarchy levels, increases logarithmically with the system size $N$, i.e. with
the number of nodes at the first level. The height $H$ decreases monotonically

three key features need to be solved simultaneously to reach higher performance
and more compact size: signal integrity, interference suppression, and
miniaturization. However, the above-mentioned requests are almost contradictory
using the traditional techniques. To overcome this challenge, here we propose
time-domain spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) as the carrier of signals.
By designing a special plasmonic waveguide constructed by printing two narrow
corrugated metallic strips on the top and bottom surfaces of a dielectric
substrate with mirror symmetry, we show that spoof SPPs are supported from very
low frequency to the cutoff frequency with strong subwavelength effects, which
can be converted to the time-domain SPPs. When two such plasmonic waveguides
are tightly packed with deep-subwavelength separation, which commonly happens
in the integrated circuits and wireless communications due to limited space, we
demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that SPP signals on such two
plasmonic waveguides have better propagation performance and much less mutual
coupling than the conventional signals on two traditional microstrip lines with
the same size and separation. Hence the proposed method can achieve significant
interference suppression in very compact space, providing a potential solution
to break the challenge of signal integrity.

implantation and studied by means of X-ray photoelectron core-level and valence
band spectroscopy as well as density functional theory calculations for
comprehensive study of the incorporation of Sn. XPS spectral analysis showed
that isovalent Sn cation substitution occurs in both zinc oxide (Sn2+ -> Zn2+)
and titanium dioxide (Sn4+ -> Ti4+) for bulk and film morphologies. For TiO2
films, the implantation also led to occupation of interstitials by doped ions,
which induced the clustering of substituted and embedded Sn atoms; this did not
occur in ZnO:Sn film samples. Density functional theory (DFT) formation
energies were calculated of various incorporation processes, explaining the
prevalence of substitutional defects in both matrices. Possible mechanisms and
reasons for the observed trends in Sn incorporation into the ZnO and TiO2

generally NP-hard due to the nonconvexity and noncontinuity of the involved

with $Z$-tensors has been considered. Under some mild conditions, we show that
to pursuit the sparsest solutions is equivalent to solving polynomial
programming with a linear objective function. The involved conditions guarantee
the desired exact relaxation and also allow to achieve a global optimal
solution to the relaxed nonconvex polynomial programming problem. Particularly,
in comparison to existing exact relaxation conditions, such as RIP-type ones,

through imaging, spectroscopy and timing analysis. Nevertheless, more
observational parameters are needed because some radiation mechanisms present
in neutrons stars or black holes are still unclear. Polarization measurements
will play a key role in discrimination between different X-ray emission models.
Such a capability becomes a mandatory requirement for the next generation of
high-energy space proposals. We have developed a CdTe-based fine-pitch imaging
spectrometer, Caliste, able to respond to these new requirements. With a
580-micron pitch and 1 keV energy resolution at 60 keV, we are able to
accurately reconstruct the polarization angle and polarization fraction of an
impinging flux of photons which are scattered by 90{\deg} after Compton
diffusion within the crystal. Thanks to its high performance in both imaging
and spectrometry, Caliste turns out to be a powerful device for high-energy
polarimetry. In this paper, we present the principles and the results obtained
for this kind of measurements: on one hand, we describe the simulation tool we
have developed to predict the polarization performances in the 50-300 keV
energy range. On the other hand, we compare simulation results with
experimental data taken at ESRF ID15A (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility)
using a mono-energetic polarized beam tuned between 35 and 300 keV. We show
that it is possible with this detector to determine with high precision the
polarization parameters (direction and fraction) for different irradiation
conditions. Applying a judicious energy selection to our data set, we reach a
remarkable sensitivity level characterized by an optimum Quality Factor of 0.78
in the 200-300 keV range. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our device at 70
keV, where hard X-ray mirrors are already available; the measured Q factor is
0.64 at 70 keV.

stratified fluid interacts with the pair of inertial levels that surround the
critical level. An exact expression for the form of the IGW is derived here in
the case of a linear shear and used to examine this interaction in detail. This
expression recovers the classical values of the transmission and reflection
coefficients $|T|=\exp(-\pi \mu )$ and $|R|=0$, where $\mu^2=J(1+\nu^2)-1/4$,
$J$ is the Richardson number and $\nu$ the ratio between the horizontal
transverse and along-shear wavenumbers.
  For large $J$, a WKB analysis provides an interpretation of this result in
term of tunnelling: an IGW incident to the lower inertial level becomes
evanescent between the inertial levels, returning to an oscillatory behaviour
above the upper inertial level. The amplitude of the transmitted wave is
directly related to the decay of the evanescent solution between the inertial
levels. In the immediate vicinity of the critical level, the evanescent IGW is
well represented by the quasi-geostrophic approximation, so that the process
can be interpreted as resulting from the coupling between balanced and
unbalanced motion.
  The exact and WKB solutions describe the so-called valve effect, a dependence
of the behaviour in the region between the inertial levels on the direction of
wave propagation. For $J < 1$ this is shown to lead to an amplification of the
wave between the inertial levels. Since the flow is inertially unstable for
$J<1$, this establishes a correspondence between the inertial-level interaction
and the condition for inertial instability.

solutions for fractional PDEs is weak at the areas close to boundary and
initial time. This paper focuses on developing the applications of wavelet
bases to numerically solving fractional PDEs and digging out the potential
benefits of wavelet methods comparing with other numerical methods, especially
in the aspects of realizing preconditioning, adaptivity, and keeping the
Toeplitz structure. More specifically, the contributions of this paper are as
follows: 1. the techniques of efficiently generating stiffness matrix with
computational cost $\mathcal{O}(2^J)$ are provided for first, second, and any
order bases; 2. theoretically and numerically discuss the effective
preconditioner for time-independent equation and multigrid method for
time-dependent equation, respectively; 3. the wavelet adaptivity is detailedly
discussed and numerically applied to solving the time-dependent (independent)
equations. In fact, having reliable, simple, and local regularity indicators is
the striking benefit of the wavelet in adaptively solving fractional PDEs (it
seems hard to give a local posteriori error estimate for the adaptive finite
element method because of the global property of the operator).

dynamics, like transition scenarios, pattern formation and dynamical modeling.
In particular, the control of nonlinear dynamics is subject of research since
decades. In this publication, actuated turbulent shear flows serve as test-bed
for a nonlinear feedback control strategy which can optimize an arbitrary cost
function in an automatic self-learning manner. This is facilitated by genetic
programming providing an analytically treatable control law. Unlike control
based on PID laws or neural networks, no structure of the control law needs to
be specified in advance. The strategy is first applied to low-dimensional
dynamical systems featuring aspects of turbulence and for which linear control
methods fail. This includes stabilizing an unstable fixed point of a
nonlinearly coupled oscillator model and maximizing mixing, i.e.\ the Lyapunov
exponent, for forced Lorenz equations. For the first time, we demonstrate the
applicability of genetic programming control to four shear flow experiments
with strong nonlinearities and intrinsically noisy measurements. These
experiments comprise mixing enhancement in a turbulent shear layer, the
reduction of the recirculation zone behind a backward facing step, and the
optimized reattachment of separating boundary layers. Genetic programming
control has outperformed tested optimized state-of-the-art control and has even
found novel actuation mechanisms.

requires a coherent model of the flow and its emission in the region where the
pulsar wind interacts with the stellar wind of its companion. We developed a
code that follows the evolution and emission of electrons in the shocked pulsar
wind based on inputs from a relativistic hydrodynamical simulation. The code is
used to model the well-documented spectral energy distribution and orbital
modulations from LS 5039. The pulsar wind is fully confined by a bow shock and
a back shock. The particles are distributed into a narrow Maxwellian, emitting
mostly GeV photons, and a power law radiating very efficiently over a broad
energy range from X-rays to TeV gamma rays. Most of the emission arises from
the apex of the bow shock. Doppler boosting shapes the X-ray and VHE
lightcurves, constraining the system inclination to $i\approx 35^{\rm o}$.
There is a tension between the hard VHE spectrum and the level of X-ray to MeV
emission, which requires differing magnetic field intensities that are hard to
achieve with a constant magnetisation $\sigma$ and Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{p}$
of the pulsar wind. Our best compromise implies $\sigma\approx 1$ and

viscosity, we have simulated the dynamics of a moderately thin accretion disk
subject to torques whose radial scaling mimics those produced by lowest-order
post-Newtonian gravitomagnetism. In this simulation, we have shown how, in the
presence of MHD turbulence, a time-steady transition can be achieved between an
inner disk region aligned with the equatorial plane of the central mass's spin
and an outer region orbiting in a different plane. The position of the
equilibrium orientation transition is determined by a balance between
gravitomagnetic torque and warp-induced inward mixing of misaligned angular
momentum from the outer disk. If the mixing is interpreted in terms of
diffusive transport, the implied diffusion coefficient is
~(0.6--0.8)c_s^2/Omega for sound speed c_s and orbital frequency Omega. This
calibration permits estimation of the orientation transition's equilibrium
location given the central mass, its spin parameter, and the disk's surface
density and scaleheight profiles. However, the alignment front overshoots
before settling into an equilibrium, signaling that a diffusive model does not
fully represent the time-dependent properties of alignment fronts under these
conditions. Because the precessional torque on the disk at the alignment front
is always comparable to the rate at which misaligned angular momentum is
brought inward to the front by warp-driven radial motions, no break forms
between the inner and outer portions of the disk in our simulation. Our results
also raise questions about the applicability to MHD warped disks of the
traditional distinction between ""bending wave"" and ""diffusive"" regimes.

been estimated purely from their excess dispersion, and has not been
corroborated by any independent means. In this paper we discuss the possibility
of detecting neutral hydrogen absorption against FRBs both from spiral arms
within our own galaxy, or from intervening extragalactic HI clouds. In either
case a firm lower limit on the distance to the FRB would be established.
Absorption against galactic spiral arms may already be detectable for bright
low-latitude bursts with existing facilities, and should certainly be so by the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Absorption against extragalactic HI clouds, which
would confirm the cosmological distances of FRBs, should also be detectable
with the SKA, and maybe also Arecibo. Quantitatively, we estimate that SKA1-MID

finite thickness are studied by micromagnetic simulations based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The eigenmodes found in the simulations are
interpreted as linear superpositions (hybridizations) of 'approximate'
three-dimensional eigenmodes, which are the fundamental gyromode $G_0$, the
spin-wave modes and the higher-order gyromodes $G_N$ (flexure modes), the
thickness dependence of which is represented by perpendicular standing spin
waves. This hybridization leads to new and surprising dependencies of the mode
frequencies on the disk thickness. The three-dimensional character of the
eigenmodes is essential to explain the recent experimental results on
vortex-core reversal observed in relatively thick Permalloy disks.

measures on the classical, irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces $G/K$ of
Cartan type $III$, where $G$ is a non-compact, connected Lie group and $K$ is a
compact, connected subgroup. By the orbital measures, we mean the uniform

  A consequence of our work is to show that the convolution product of any

any of these symmetric spaces, other than those whose restricted root system is
type $A_{n}$ or $D_{3}$, when rank$G/K$ $+1$ is needed.

  In this work we present a sequence for the development of this major
phenomenological theory for superconductors. We will begin with a brief
introduction to the criticality and phase transitions phenomena e then we will
describe the Landau theory for second order phase transitions. After that, we
will introduce the Ginzburg-Landau theory and the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory. As an application of this last one, we will study two
mesoscopic systems. One of them a homogeneous sample and the other one a sample
with surface defects. We show that the defects strongly influences the vortex
dynamics of the system. Keywords: Ginzburg-Landau, mesoscopic, vortex,

the majority of current biological simulations are done with simple models,
such as TIP3P and SPC, developed almost thirty years ago and only slightly
modified since then. The reason is that the non-polarizable force fields that
are mostly used to describe proteins and other biological molecules are
incompatible with more sophisticated modern polarizable models of water. The
issue is electronic polarizability: in liquid state, in protein, and in vacuum
the water molecule is polarized differently, and therefore has different
properties; thus the only way to describe all these different media with the
same model is to use a polarizable water model. However, to be compatible with
the force field of the rest of the system, e.g. a protein, the latter should be
polarizable as well. Here we describe a novel model of water that is in effect
polarizable, and yet compatible with the standard non-polarizable force fields
such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, OPLS, etc. Thus the model resolves the
outstanding problem of incompatibility.

differentiable at some points, like in physical systems of ECG, EEG plots, and

functions cannot be characterized-especially at the non-differentiable points.
To characterize those functions the concept of Fractional Derivative is used.
From the analysis it is established that though those functions are unreachable
at the non-differentiable points, in classical sense but can be characterized
using Fractional derivative. In this paper we demonstrate use of modified
Riemann-Liouvelli derivative by Jumarrie to calculate the fractional
derivatives of the non-differentiable points of a function, which may be one
step to characterize and distinguish and compare several non-differentiable
points in a system or across the systems. This method we are extending to
differentiate various ECG graphs by quantification of non-differentiable
points; is useful method in differential diagnostic. Each steps of calculating
these fractional derivatives is elaborated.
