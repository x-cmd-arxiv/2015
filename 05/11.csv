has been studied analytically for the case with N noninteracting particles.
Then, the effect of interaction is evaluated numerically via a two-body system.
Two cases are considered: (i) Starting from a ground state the evolution is
induced by a sudden change of the laser field, and (ii) Starting from a
superposition state. Oscillating persistent spin-currents have been found. A
set of formulae have been derived to describe the period and amplitude of the

adjusting the parameters of the laser beams. In particular, it is predicted
that movable stripes might emerge on the ring.

Usually, these MaxSAT algorithms perform better when small unsatisfiable

instances, since the whole formula is given to the SAT solver in each call. In
this paper, we propose to partition the MaxSAT formula using a resolution-based

hair (MPBHsSH) as fully non-linear solutions of five dimensional Einstein
gravity minimally coupled to a complex, massive scalar field. The MPBHsSH are,
in general, regular on and outside the horizon, asymptotically flat, and
possess angular momentum in a single rotation plane. They are supported by
rotation and have no static limit. Such hairy BHs may be thought of as bound
states of boson stars and singly spinning, vacuum MPBHs and inherit properties
of both these building blocks. When the horizon area shrinks to zero, the
solutions reduce to (in a single plane) rotating boson stars; but the extremal
limit also yields a zero area horizon, as for singly spinning MPBHs. Similarly
to the case of equal angular momenta, and in contrast to Kerr black holes with
scalar hair, singly spinning MPBHsSH are disconnected from the vacuum black
holes, due to a mass gap. We observe that for the general case, with two
unequal angular momenta, the equilibrium condition for the existence of MPBHsSH
is $w=m_1\Omega_1+m_2\Omega_2$, where $\Omega_i$ are the horizon angular
velocities in the two independent rotation planes and $w,m_i$, $i=1,2$, are the

The stellar masses and SFRs show a clear correlation known as the ""main

sequence of the [OIII] emitters at z=3.2 and 3.6 is almost identical to that of
the H$\alpha$ emitters at z=2.2 and 2.5. Also, we investigate their mass-size
relation and find that the relation does not change between the two epochs.
When we assume that the star-forming galaxies at z=3.2 grow simply along the
same main sequence down to z=2.2, galaxies with $M_* = 10^{9}$-$10^{11}
M_{\odot}$ increase their stellar masses significantly by a factor of 10-2.
They climb up the main sequence, and their star formation rates also increase a
lot as their stellar masses grow. This indicates that star formation activities
of galaxies are accelerated from z>3 towards the peak epoch of galaxy formation

which individuals take control over participation in data analytics projects in
two ways: 1) individuals can contribute data at a self-chosen level of
precision, and 2) individuals can decide whether they want to contribute at all

research analyst has flexibility to set requirements for data precision, so
that individuals are still willing to contribute to the project, and the
quality of the estimation improves. We study this tradeoff scenario for
populations of homogeneous and heterogeneous individuals, and determine Nash
equilibria that reflect the optimal level of participation and precision of
contributions. We further prove that the analyst can substantially increase the
accuracy of the analysis by imposing a lower bound on the precision of the data

statistically inefficient as estimators of the true parameter value. To address
these two issues, we propose a new iterative procedure termed averaged implicit
SGD (AI-SGD). For statistical efficiency, AI-SGD employs averaging of the
iterates, which achieves the optimal Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound under strong
convexity, i.e., it is an optimal unbiased estimator of the true parameter

iteration, which is related to proximal operators in optimization. In practice,
AI-SGD achieves competitive performance with other state-of-the-art procedures.
Furthermore, it is more stable than averaging procedures that do not employ
proximal updates, and is simple to implement as it requires fewer tunable
hyperparameters than procedures that do employ proximal updates.

process $np \to d\gamma$, and the photo-disintegration processes
$\gamma^{(\ast)} d \to np$. In nuclear potential models, such contributions are
described by phenomenological meson-exchange currents, while in the present
work, they are determined directly from the quark and gluon interactions of
QCD. Calculations of neutron-proton energy levels in multiple background
magnetic fields are performed at two values of the quark masses, corresponding
to pion masses of $m_\pi \sim 450$ and 806 MeV, and are combined with pionless
nuclear effective field theory to determine these low-energy inelastic
processes. Extrapolating to the physical pion mass, a cross section of
$\sigma^{lqcd}(np\to d\gamma)=332.4({\tiny \begin{array}{l}+5.4 \\ -

  of the Royal Society Interface, in press (2015)",,,,"cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Groups of eukaryotic cilia and flagella are capable of coordinating their
beating over large scales, routinely exhibiting collective dynamics in the form
of metachronal waves. The origin of this behaviour -- possibly influenced by
both mechanical interactions and direct biological regulation -- is poorly
understood, in large part due to lack of quantitative experimental studies.
Here we characterise in detail flagellar coordination on the surface of the
multicellular alga $Volvox~carteri$, an emerging model organism for flagellar
dynamics. Our studies reveal for the first time that the average metachronal
coordination observed is punctuated by periodic phase defects during which
synchrony is partial and limited to specific groups of cells. A minimal model
of hydrodynamically coupled oscillators can reproduce semi-quantitatively the
characteristics of the average metachronal dynamics, and the emergence of
defects. We systematically study the model's behaviour by assessing the effect
of changing intrinsic rotor characteristics, including oscillator stiffness and
the nature of their internal driving force, as well as their geometric
properties and spatial arrangement. Our results suggest that metachronal
coordination follows from deformations in the oscillators' limit cycles induced
by hydrodynamic stresses, and that defects result from sufficiently steep local
biases in the oscillators' intrinsic frequencies. Additionally, we find that
random variations in the intrinsic rotor frequencies increase the robustness of
the average properties of the emergent metachronal waves.

in Darcy's law. The permeability is described by an effective hydraulic pore
radius in the porous medium, the fluctuation in local hydraulic pore radii, the
length of streamlines, and the fractional volume conducting flow. The effective
hydraulic pore radius is related to a characteristic hydraulic length, the
fluctuation in local hydraulic radii is related to a constriction factor, the
length of streamlines is characterized by a tortuosity, and the fractional
volume conducting flow from inlet to outlet is described by an effective
porosity. The characteristic length, the constriction factor, the tortuosity
and the effective porosity are thus intrinsic descriptors of the pore structure
relative to direction. We show that the combined effect of our pore structure
description fully describes the permeability of a porous medium. The theory is
applied to idealized porous media, where it reproduces Darcy's law for fluid
flow derived from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. We also apply this theory to
full network models of Fontainebleau sandstone, where we show how the pore
structure and permeability correlate with porosity for such natural porous
media. This work establishes how the permeability can be related to porosity,
in the sense of Kozeny-Carman, through fundamental and well-defined pore
structure parameters: characteristic length, constriction, and tortuosity.

LSC EXP-08-2010 the ArDM detector underwent an intensive period of technical
completion and safety approval until the recent filling of the target vessel

achievements during commissioning of ArDM and the transition into a stage of
first physics data taking in single phase operational mode. We present
preliminary observations from this run. A first indication for the background

outlook for completing the detector with the electric drift field and upgrade
of the scintillation light readout system with novel detector modules based on
SiPMs in order to improve the light yield.

especially for masses below that of the Sun, making each new dynamical mass and
radius measurement a valuable test of theoretical models. Stellar mass
dependent features of star formation (such as disk evolution, planet formation,
and even the IMF) are fundamentally tied to these models, which implies a
systematic uncertainty that can only be improved with precise measurements of
calibrator stars. We present the discovery that UScoCTIO 5, a known
spectroscopic binary (P = 34 days, Mtot sin(i) = 0.64 Msun), is an eclipsing
system with both primary and secondary eclipses apparent in K2 light curves
obtained during Campaign 2. We have simultaneously fit the eclipse profiles
from the K2 light curves and the existing RV data to demonstrate that UScoCTIO
5 consists of a pair of nearly identical M4.5 stars with M_A = 0.329 +/- 0.002

predicted by stellar evolutionary models, but none agree to within the
uncertainties. All models predict systematically incorrect masses at the
25--50% level for the HR diagram position of these mid-M dwarfs, suggesting
significant modifications for any trend of other properties that vary with
stellar mass. The form of the discrepancy for most model sets is not that they
predict luminosities that are too low, but rather that they predict
temperatures that are too high, suggesting that the models do not fully
encompass the physics of energy transport (via convection and/or missing
opacities) and/or a miscalibration of the SpT-Teff scale. The simplest
modification to the models (changing Teff to match observations) would yield an
older age for this system, in line with the recently proposed older age of
Upper Scorpius (~11 Myr).

previously known. Recently, a team involved in APOGEE, one of the Sloan Digital

carried out low-resolution FORS2 spectropolarimetric observations of HD23478

  From the measurements using hydrogen lines, we discover a rather strong
longitudinal magnetic field of the order of up to 1.5kG in HD23478, and up to
1.3kG using the entire spectrum. The analysis of HD345439 using four subsequent
spectropolarimetric subexposures does not reveal the presence of a magnetic
field at a significance level of 3sigma. On the other hand, the inspection of
individual subexposures indicates that HD345439 may host a strong magnetic
field, rapidly varying over 88 minutes. A hint at the fast rotation of HD345439
is also given by the behaviour of several metallic and He I lines in the
low-resolution FORS2 spectra, showing profile variations already on such a
short time scale.

best modeled via a subclass called regression graph models and, especially
traceable regressions. Regression graphs include two types of undirected graph
and directed acyclic graphs in ordered sequences of joint responses. Response
components may correspond to discrete or continuous random variables and may
depend exclusively on variables which have been generated earlier. These
aspects are essential when causal hypothesis are the motivation for the
planning of empirical studies.

for predicting structure in alternative models, the generated distributions
have to mimic some properties of joint Gaussian distributions. Here, relevant
results concerning these aspects are spelled out and illustrated by examples.
With regression graph models, it becomes feasible, for the first time, to
derive structural effects of (1) ignoring some of the variables, of (2)
selecting subpopulations via fixed levels of some other variables or of (3)
changing the order in which the variables might get generated. Thus, the most

investigated for various manifestations of the mass transfer and gravitational
radiation processes in binary systems. The monotonicity of the period
variations and the morphology of the respective ETV diagrams are thoroughly
explored in both the direct impact and the accretion disk mode of mass
transfer, accompanied by different types of mass and angular momentum losses
(through a hot-spot emission from the gainer and via the L2/L3 points). Mass
transfer rates comparable to or greater than 10^{-8} M_sun/yr are measurable
for typical noise levels of the ETV diagrams, regardless of whether the process
is conservative. However, the presence of a transient disk around the more
massive component defines a critical mass ratio q_cr ~ 0.83 above which the
period turns out to decrease when still in the conservative regime, rendering
the measurability of the anticipated variations a much more complicated task.
The effects of gravitational radiation proved to be rather undetectable, except
for systems with physical characteristics that only refer to cataclysmic
variables. Unlike the hot-spot effects, the Lagrangian points L2 and L3 support
very efficient routes of strong angular momentum loss. It is further shown that
escape of mass via the L3 point - when the donor is the less massive component
- safely provides critical mass ratios above which the period is expected to
decrease, no matter how intense the process is.

influence is often presented in a bad light, often because it supposedly
increases market unpredictability.
  Here we study a model of trial-offer markets, in which participants try
products and later decide whether to purchase. We consider a simple policy
which ranks the products by quality when presenting them to market
participants. We show that, in this setting, market efficiency always benefits
from social influence. Moreover, we prove that the market converges almost
surely to a monopoly for the product of highest quality, making the market both
predictable and asymptotically optimal. Computational experiments confirm that
the quality ranking policy identifies ""blockbusters"" in reasonable time,
outperforms other policies, and is highly predictable. These results indicate
that social influence does not necessarily increase market unpredicatibility.
The outcome really depends on how social influence is used.

presents a framework for answering this fundamental question in the context of
correlation mining, with implications for general large scale inference. In
large scale data applications like genomics, connectomics, and eco-informatics
the dataset is often variable-rich but sample-starved: a regime where the
number $n$ of acquired samples (statistical replicates) is far fewer than the
number $p$ of observed variables (genes, neurons, voxels, or chemical
constituents). Much of recent work has focused on understanding the
computational complexity of proposed methods for ""Big Data."" Sample complexity
however has received relatively less attention, especially in the setting when
the sample size $n$ is fixed, and the dimension $p$ grows without bound. To
address this gap, we develop a unified statistical framework that explicitly
quantifies the sample complexity of various inferential tasks. Sampling regimes
can be divided into several categories: 1) the classical asymptotic regime
where the variable dimension is fixed and the sample size goes to infinity; 2)
the mixed asymptotic regime where both variable dimension and sample size go to
infinity at comparable rates; 3) the purely high dimensional asymptotic regime
where the variable dimension goes to infinity and the sample size is fixed.
Each regime has its niche but only the latter regime applies to exa-scale data
dimension. We illustrate this high dimensional framework for the problem of
correlation mining, where it is the matrix of pairwise and partial correlations
among the variables that are of interest. We demonstrate various regimes of
correlation mining based on the unifying perspective of high dimensional
learning rates and sample complexity for different structured covariance models
and different inference tasks.

vortices in protoplanetary discs using 2-D shearing box simulations with
Lagrangian dust particles. We consider dust with a variety of sizes (stopping
time $t_s = 10^{-2}\Omega^{-1} - 10^{2}\Omega^{-1}$, from fully coupled with
the gas to the decoupling limit. We find that a vortex is destroyed by dust
feedback when the total dust-to-gas mass ratio within the vortex is larger than
30-50%, independent of the dust size. The dust distribution can still be
asymmetric in some cases after the vortex has been destroyed. With smaller
amounts of dust, a vortex can survive for at least 100 orbits, and the maximum
dust surface density within the vortex can be more than 100 times larger than
the gas surface density, potentially facilitating planetesimal formation. On
the other hand, in these stable vortices, small ($t_s < \Omega^{-1}$) and large
($t_s > \Omega^{-1}$) dust grains concentrate differently and affect the gas
dynamics in different ways. The distribution of large dust is more elongated
than that of small dust. Large dust ($t_s > \Omega^{-1}$) concentrates in the
centre of the vortex and feedback leads to turn-over in vorticity towards the
centre, forming a quiescent region within an anticyclonic vortex. Such a
turn-over is absent if the vortex is loaded with small grains. We demonstrate
that, in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains are
present and under the right condition, the concentration of large dust towards
the vortex centre can lead to a quiescent centre, repelling the small dust and
forming a small dust ring around the vortex centre. Such anticorrelations
between small and large dust within vortices may explain the discrepancy
between ALMA and near-IR scattered light observations in the asymmetric region

sifted key; thus, privacy amplification, which removes any leaked information
from the key, generally depends on the bit error rate. Recently, a round-robin
differential-phase-shift QKD protocol for which privacy amplification does not
rely on the bit error rate [Nature 509, 475 (2014)] was proposed. The amount of
leaked information can be bounded by the sender during the state-preparation
stage and hence, is independent of the behaviour of the unreliable quantum
channel. In our work, we apply the tagging technique to the protocol and
present a tight bound on the key rate and employ a decoy-state method. The
effects of background noise and misalignment are taken into account under
practical conditions. Our simulation results show that the protocol can

is not easy. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal gating
window with a visible guiding system in RGRT.
  Materials and Methods: Between April and October in 2014 the breathing
signals of 23 lung cancer patients were recorded with a Real-time Position
Management (RPM) respiratory gating system (Varian, USA). We performed
statistical analysis with breathing signals to find the optimal gating window
for the guided breathing for RGRT.
  Results: 19 of the 23 patients showed statistically significant differences
(p < 0.05) when the breathing signals obtained before and after breathing
training were compared, The standard deviation of the respiration signals after
breathing training was the lowest in the phase of 30 % - 70 % (p < 0.05).
  Conclusions: RGRT with RPM system was confirmed the usefulness of the visible
guiding system. Respiratory regularity was significantly improved with the use
of the RPM with our visible guidance system, therefore, it would help improve

HII region with the ASTE 10 m telescope (HPBW~22 arcsec) to search for
molecular outflows and dense clumps.We found that the velocity field in the
region is highly complex, consisting of at least four distinct velocity
components at V LSR ~ 3, 5, 7, and 10 km/s. The ~7 km/s component represents
the systemic velocity of cold gas surroundingthe entire region, and causes
heavy absorption in the CO spectra over the velocity range 6 <V LSR< 9 km/s.
The ~5 and ~10 km/s components exhibit high CO temperature (>40 K) and are
found mostly around the HII region, suggesting that these components are likely
to be tracing dense gas interacting with the expanding shell around the HII
region. Based on the CO data, we identified 13 regions of high velocity gas
which we interpret as candidate outflow lobes. Using the HCO+ data, we also
identified six clumps and estimated their physical parameters. On the basis of
the ASTE data and near-infrared images from 2MASS, we present an updated
three-dimensional model of this region. In order to investigate molecular
outflows in W40, the SiO (J=1-0, v=0) emission line and some other emission

evacuation routes, decide departure times, and mobilize resources to issue
orders, all under strict time constraints. Existing algorithms almost always
allow for preemptive evacuation schedules, which are less desirable in
practice. This paper proposes, for the first time, a constraint-based
scheduling model that optimizes the evacuation flow rate (number of vehicles
sent at regular time intervals) and evacuation phasing of widely populated
areas, while ensuring a nonpreemptive evacuation for each residential zone. Two
optimization objectives are considered: (1) to maximize the number of evacuees
reaching safety and (2) to minimize the overall duration of the evacuation.
Preliminary results on a set of real-world instances show that the approach can
produce, within a few seconds, a non-preemptive evacuation schedule which is
either optimal or at most 6% away of the optimal preemptive solution.

deciphering the physical processes during the Dark Ages and subsequent Epoch of
Reionization (EoR). However, detection of this faint monopole is challenging
due to high precision required in instrumental calibration and modeling of
substantially brighter foregrounds and instrumental systematics. In particular,
modeling of receiver noise with mK accuracy and its separation remains a
formidable task in experiments aiming to detect the global signal using
single-element spectral radiometers. Interferometers do not respond to receiver
noise; therefore, we explore here the theory of the response of interferometers
to global signals. In other words, we discuss the spatial coherence in the
electric field arising from the monopole component of the 21-cm signal and
methods for its detection using sensor arrays. We proceed by first deriving the
response to uniform sky of two-element interferometers made of unit dipole and
resonant loop antennas, then extend the analysis to interferometers made of 1-D
arrays and also consider 2-D aperture antennas. Finally, we describe methods by
which the coherence might be enhanced so that the interferometer measurements
yield improved sensitivity to the monopole component. We conclude that (a) it
is indeed possible to measure the global 21-cm from EoR using interferometers,
(b) a practically useful configuration is with omnidirectional antennas as the
interferometer elements, and (c) that the spatial coherence may be enhanced and
detectability of the global EoR signal may be smoothened using, for example, a
space beam splitter between the interferometer elements.

epidemiological models with ordinary derivatives replaced by fractional

fractional differential operators arise naturally in these models whenever the
recovery time from the disease is power law distributed. This can provide a
model for a chronic disease process where individuals who are infected for a
long time are unlikely to recover. The fractional order recovery model is shown
to be consistent with the Kermack-McKendrick age-structured SIR model and it
reduces to the Hethcote-Tudor integral equation SIR model. The derivation from
a stochastic process is extended to discrete time, providing a stable numerical
method for solving the model equations. We have carried out simulations of the
fractional order recovery model showing convergence to equilibrium states. The
number of infecteds in the endemic equilibrium state increases as the
fractional order of the derivative tends to zero.

Saturnian radii in size, and probably broadening. Both the bulk of dust

loosely based on the Median Voter Theorem which has been used with great
success for about 30 years. However, there are fundamental mathematical
limitations to these models. They apply to issues which can be represented on a
single one-dimensional continuum. They represent fundamental group decision
process by a deterministic Condorcet Election: deterministic voting by all
actors, and deterministic outcomes of each vote. This work provides a
methodology for addressing a broader class of problems. The first extension is
to continuous issue sets where the consequences of policies are not
well-described by a distance measure or utility is not monotonic in distance.
The second fundamental extension is to inherently discrete issue sets. Because
the options cannot easily be mapped into a multidimensional space so that the
utility depends on distance, we refer to it as a non-spatial issue set. The
third, but most fundamental, extension is to represent the negotiating process
as a probabilistic Condorcet election (PCE). The actors' generalized voting is
deterministic, but the outcomes of the votes is probabilistic. The PCE provides
the flexibility to make the first two extensions possible; this flexibility
comes at the cost of less precise predictions and more complex validation. The
methodology has been implemented in two proof-of-concept prototypes which
address the subset selection problem of forming a parliament, and strategy
optimization for one-dimensional issues.

the 1970s, forms the basis of modern subspace methods for 1D frequency
estimation. Many related numerical tools have also been developed for
multidimensional (MD), especially 2D, frequency estimation; however, a
fundamental question has remained unresolved as to whether an analog of the
Vandermonde decomposition holds for multilevel Toeplitz matrices in the MD
case. In this paper, an affirmative answer to this question and a constructive
method for finding the decomposition are provided when the matrix rank is lower
than the dimension of each Toeplitz block. A numerical method for searching for
a decomposition is also proposed when the matrix rank is higher. The new
results are applied to studying MD frequency estimation within the recent
super-resolution framework. A precise formulation of the atomic $\ell_0$ norm
is derived using the Vandermonde decomposition. Practical algorithms for
frequency estimation are proposed based on relaxation techniques. Extensive
numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these

ASTRODEEP project and it can be considered as the next generation to TFIT,
providing significant improvements above it and other similar codes. T-PHOT
gathers data from a high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses it
to obtain priors for the photometric analysis of a lower resolution image of
the same field. It can handle different types of datasets as input priors: i) a
list of objects that will be used to obtain cutouts from the real
high-resolution image; ii) a set of analytical models; iii) a list of
unresolved, point-like sources, useful e.g. for far-infrared wavelength
domains. We show that T-PHOT yields accurate estimations of fluxes within the
intrinsic uncertainties of the method, when systematic errors are taken into
account (which can be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output).
T-PHOT is many times faster than similar codes like TFIT and CONVPHOT (up to
hundreds, depending on the problem and the method adopted), whilst at the same
time being more robust and more versatile. This makes it an optimal choice for
the analysis of large datasets. In addition we show how the use of different
settings and methods significantly enhances the performance. Given its
versatility and robustness, T-PHOT can be considered the preferred choice for
combined photometric analysis of current and forthcoming extragalactic optical

spectral lines. Combining the recently-launched Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Hinode, we have a unique
opportunity to study spicules simultaneously in multiple passbands and from a
seeing free environment. This makes it possible to study their thermal
evolution over a large range of temperatures. A recent study showed that
spicules appear in several chromospheric and transition region spectral lines,
suggesting that spicules continue their evolution in hotter passbands after
they fade from Ca II H. In this follow-up paper we answer some of the questions
that were raised in the introductory study. In addition, we study spicules
off-limb in C II 1330 {\AA} for the first time. We find that Ca II H spicules
are more similar to Mg II 2796 {\AA} spicules than initially reported. For a
sample of 54 spicules, we find that 44% of Si IV 1400 {\AA} spicules are
brighter toward the top; 56% of the spicules show an increase in Si IV emission
when the Ca II H component fades. We find several examples of spicules that
fade from passbands other than Ca II H, and we observe that if a spicule fades
from a passband, it also generally fades from the passbands with lower
formation temperatures. We discuss what these new, multi-spectral results mean
for the classification of type I and II spicules.

pulsation models cover a broad range in stellar luminosity and effective
temperatures and the modal stability is investigated for both fundamental and

of the metal content and new analytical relations for the edges of the
instability strip in the observational plane. Moreover, a new analytical
relation to constrain the pulsation mass of double pulsators as a function of
the period ratio and the metal content is provided. We derive new
Period-Radius-Metallicity relations for fundamental and first-overtone
pulsators. They agree quite well with similar empirical and theoretical
relations in the literature. From the predicted bolometric light curves,
transformed into optical (UBVRI) and near-infrared (JHK) bands, we compute the

  Let $k$ be a finite field of cardinality $q^n$ and let $k'$ be its subfield

fluctuations and the background radiation surrounding the free-space optical
(FSO) receiver contributes an undesired noisy component, the receiver requires
accurate channel state information (CSI) and background information to adjust
the detection threshold. In most previous studies, for CSI acquisition, pilot
symbols were employed, which leads to a reduction of spectral and energy
efficiency; and an impractical assumption that the background radiation
component is perfectly known was made. In this paper, we develop an efficient
and robust sequence receiver, which acquires the CSI and the background
information implicitly and requires no knowledge about the channel model
information. It is robust since it can automatically estimate the CSI and
background component and detect the data sequence accordingly. Its decision
metric has a simple form and involves no integrals, and thus can be easily
evaluated. A Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm is adopted to improve the
search efficiency, and a selective-store strategy is adopted to overcome a
potential error floor problem as well as to increase the memory efficiency. To
further simplify the receiver, a decision-feedback symbol-by-symbol receiver is
proposed as an approximation of the sequence receiver. By simulations and
theoretical analysis, we show that the performance of both the sequence
receiver and the symbol-by-symbol receiver, approach that of detection with
perfect knowledge of the CSI and background radiation, as the length of the
window for forming the decision metric increases.

for computing the velocity $c$ of triplet excitations in antiferromagnets. We
consider the standard $S=1/2$ one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg models, as
well as a bilayer Heisenberg model at its critical point. Computing correlation
functions in imaginary time and using their long-time behavior, we extract the
lowest excitation energy versus momentum using improved fitting procedures and
a generalized moment method. The velocity is then obtained from the dispersion
relation. We also exploit winding numbers to define a cubic space-time
geometry, where the velocity is obtained as the ratio of the spatial and
temporal lengths of the system when all winding number fluctuations are equal.
The two methods give consistent results for both ordered and critical systems,
but the winding-number estimator is more precise. For the Heisenberg chain, we
accurately reproduce the exactly known velocity. For the two-dimensional
Heisenberg model, our results are consistent with other recent calculations,
but with an improved statistical precision; $c=1.65847(4)$. We also use the
hydrodynamic relation $c^2=\rho_s/\chi_\perp(q\to 0)$ between $c$, the spin
stiffness $\rho_s$, and the transversal susceptibility $\chi_\perp$, using the
smallest non-zero momentum $q=2\pi/L$. This method also is well controlled in
two dimensions, but the cubic criterion for winding numbers delivers better
numerical precision. In one dimension the hydrodynamic relation is affected by
logarithmic corrections which make accurate extrapolations difficult. As an
application of the winding-number method, for the quantum-critical bilayer
model our high-precision determination of the velocity enables us to
quantitatively test, at an unprecedented level, field-theoretic predictions for
low-temperature scaling forms where $c$ enters.

for constructing families of fractal objects arising from a conserved physical

shares exactly one vertex with an edge in $M$. The dominating induced matching
problem (also known as efficient edge domination) asks whether a graph $G$
contains a dominating induced matching. This problem is generally NP-complete,
but polynomial-time solvable for graphs with some special properties. In
particular, it is solvable in polynomial time for claw-free graphs. In the
present paper, we study this problem for graphs containing no long claw, i.e.
no induced subgraph obtained from the claw by subdividing each of its edges
exactly once. To solve the problem in this class, we reduce it to the following
question: given a graph $G$ and a subset of its vertices, does $G$ contain a
matching saturating all vertices of the subset? We show that this question can
be answered in polynomial time, thus providing a polynomial-time algorithm to
solve the dominating induced matching problem for graphs containing no long
claw.

most of the soft X-ray continuum along our line of sight and lowers the
ionizing luminosity received by the classical warm absorber. Here we present
the analysis of the high resolution X-ray spectra collected with XMM-Newton and
Chandra throughout the campaign, which are suitable to investigate the
variability of both the obscurer and the classical warm absorber. The time
separation between these X-ray observations range from 2 days to 8 months. On
these timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and in
covering fraction. This is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. The
most significant variation occurred in September 2013 when the source
brightened for two weeks. A higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lower
obscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shape
during the flare. We suggest that a geometrical change of the soft X-ray source
behind the obscurer cause the observed drop in the covering fraction. Due to
the higher soft X-ray continuum level the September 2013 Chandra spectrum is
the only X ray spectrum of the campaign where individual features of the warm
absorber could be detected. The spectrum shows absorption from Fe-UTA,
\ion{O}{iv}, and \ion{O}{v}, consistent to belong to the lower-ionization
counterpart of the historical NGC 5548 warm absorber. Hence, we confirm that
the warm absorber has responded to the drop in the ionizing luminosity caused
by the obscurer.

the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase
(HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO,
STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and
PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and STEREO/SWAVES. We describe

all the correctly functioning nodes to agree on a common reference frame as

faulty. As the protocol is asynchronous, it can be used with some assumptions
to synchronise clocks over a network. Also, the protocol has the appealing
property that it allows any existing two-node asynchronous protocol for
reference frame agreement to be lifted to a robust protocol for an asynchronous

exponentiation, the two-dimensional conformal transformations. A key point of
our construction is the recent result on the closed forms of the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. In particular, our covariantization receipt
is quite general. This has a deep consequence since it means that the
covariantization of the conformal group is {\it always definite}. Our
covariantization receipt is quite general and apply in general situations,
including AdS/CFT. Here we focus on the projective unitary representations of
the fundamental group of a Riemann surface, which may include elliptic points
and punctures, introduced in the framework of noncommutative Riemann surfaces.
It turns out that the covariantized conformal operators are built in terms of
Wilson loops around Poincar\'e geodesics, implying a deep relationship between
gauge theories on Riemann surfaces and Liouville theory.

that $\Sigma_{\max}$ acts as a critical point where the length scale of those

we argue instead that the entire solid phase ($\Sigma<\Sigma_{\max}$) is
critical, that plasticity always involves system-spanning events, and that
their magnitude diverges at $\Sigma_{\max}$ independently of the presence of
shear bands. We relate the statistics and fractal properties of these
rearrangements to an exponent $\theta$ that captures the stability of the
material, which is observed to vary continuously with stress, and we confirm
our predictions in elastoplastic models.

the hysteresis area of the magnetization curves as a function of temperature

a clear loss of the magneto-structural transition. For all thermal cycles the
O(I) phase remains unchanged. Therefore, prolonged thermal cycling leads to a
strong reduction of the O(II) phase, attributed to an internal pressure
build-up, caused by the large number of expansion/compression cycles that the
O(II) phase undergoes across the magnetostructural transition.

Hitherto, work on rectified linear units (ReLU) provides empirical and
theoretical evidence on performance increase of neural networks comparing to
typically used sigmoid activation function. In this paper, we investigate a new
manner of improving neural networks by introducing a bunch of copies of the
same neuron modeled by the generalized Kumaraswamy distribution. As a result,
we propose novel non-linear activation function which we refer to as
Kumaraswamy unit which is closely related to ReLU. In the experimental study
with MNIST image corpora we evaluate the Kumaraswamy unit applied to
single-layer (shallow) neural network and report a significant drop in test
classification error and test cross-entropy in comparison to sigmoid unit, ReLU

files are duplicated on unreliable data servers is investigated. Due to a
server breakdown, a copy of a file can be lost, it can be retrieved if another
copy of the same file is stored on other servers. In the case where no other
copy of a given file is present in the network, it is definitively lost. In
order to have multiple copies of a given file, it is assumed that each server
can devote a fraction of its processing capacity to duplicate files on other
servers to enhance the durability of the system.
  A simplified stochastic model of this network is analyzed. It is assumed that
a copy of a given file is lost at some fixed rate and that the initial state is
optimal: each file has the maximum number $d$ of copies located on the servers
of the network. Due to random losses, the state of the network is transient and
all files will be eventually lost. As a consequence, a transient
$d$-dimensional Markov process $(X(t))$ with a unique absorbing state describes
the evolution this network. By taking a scaling parameter $N$ related to the
number of nodes of the network. a scaling analysis of this process is
developed. The asymptotic behavior of $(X(t))$ is analyzed on time scales of
the type $t\mapsto N^p t$ for $0\leq p\leq d{-}1$. The paper derives asymptotic
results on the decay of the network: Under a stability assumption, the main
results state that the critical time scale for the decay of the system is given
by $t\mapsto N^{d-1}t$. When the stability condition is not satisfied, it is
shown that the state of the network converges to an interesting local
equilibrium which is investigated. As a consequence it sheds some light on the
role of the key parameters $\lambda$, the duplication rate and $d$, the maximal
number of copies, in the design of these systems.

modeled using Bayesian penalized B-splines while a hierarchical structure
allows the clustering to be guided by the smoothness of individual curves. In a
sense, the hierarchical structure balances the desire to fit individual curves
well while still producing meaningful clusters that are used to guide
prediction. We seamlessly incorporate available covariate information to guide
the clustering of curves non-parametrically through the use of a product
partition model prior for a random partition of individuals. Clustering based
on curve smoothness and subject-specific covariate information is particularly
important in carrying out the two types of predictions that are of interest,
those that complete a partially observed curve from an active player, and those

applications to the identification of pirates in a multimedia setting.
Combinatorially, $\overline{t}$-separable codes lie somewhere between
$t$-frameproof and $(t-1)$-frameproof codes: all $t$-frameproof codes are
$\overline{t}$-separable, and all $\overline{t}$-separable codes are
$(t-1)$-frameproof. Results for frameproof codes show that (when $q$ is large)
there are $q$-ary $\overline{t}$-separable codes of length $n$ with
approximately $q^{\lceil n/t\rceil}$ codewords, and that no $q$-ary
$\overline{t}$-separable codes of length $n$ can have more than approximately
$q^{\lceil n/(t-1)\rceil}$ codewords.
  The paper provides improved probabilistic existence results for
$\overline{t}$-separable codes when $t\geq 3$. More precisely, for all $t\geq
3$ and all $n\geq 3$, there exists a constant $\kappa$ (depending only on $t$
and $n$) such that there exists a $q$-ary $\overline{t}$-separable code of
length $n$ with at least $\kappa q^{n/(t-1)}$ codewords for all sufficiently
large integers $q$. This shows, in particular, that the upper bound (derived
from the bound on $(t-1)$-frameproof codes) on the number of codewords in a
$\overline{t}$-separable code is realistic.
  The results above are more surprising after examining the situation when
$t=2$. Results due to Gao and Ge show that a $q$-ary $\overline{2}$-separable
code of length $n$ can contain at most $\frac{3}{2}q^{2\lceil
n/3\rceil}-\frac{1}{2}q^{\lceil n/3\rceil}$ codewords, and that codes with at
least $\kappa q^{2n/3}$ codewords exist. So optimal $\overline{2}$-separable
codes behave neither like $2$-frameproof nor $1$-frameproof codes.
  Also, the Gao--Ge bound is strengthened to show that a $q$-ary
$\overline{2}$-separable code of length $n$ can have at most \[ q^{\lceil
2n/3\rceil}+\tfrac{1}{2}q^{\lfloor n/3\rfloor}(q^{\lfloor n/3\rfloor}-1) \]

derived by means of the comparison between steady-state analytic models and the
available observables. With the aim of studying the biases of this approach, we
fitted different analytic models to simulated observations obtained from a
suite of direct N-body simulations of star clusters in different stages of
their evolution and under different levels of tidal stress to derive mass, mass
function and degree of anisotropy. We find that masses can be
under/over-estimated up to 50% depending on the degree of relaxation reached by
the cluster, the available range of observed masses and distances of radial
velocity measures from the cluster center and the strength of the tidal field.
The mass function slope appears to be better constrainable and less sensitive
to model inadequacies unless strongly dynamically evolved clusters and a
non-optimal location of the measured luminosity function are considered. The
degree and the characteristics of the anisotropy developed in the N-body
simulations are not adequately reproduced by popular analytic models and can be
detected only if accurate proper motions are available. We show how to reduce
the uncertainties in the mass, mass-function and anisotropy estimation and

electrical behaviors. The cross-plane lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_{L}$
is 40-60% lower than the in-plane values. Extremely low $\kappa_{L}$ is found
for both materials because of high anharmonicity. It is suggested that
nanostructuring would be difficult to further decrease $\kappa_{L}$ because of
the short mean free paths of dominant phonon modes (1-30 nm at 300 K) while
alloying would be efficient in reducing $\kappa_{L}$ considering that the
relative $\kappa_{L}$ contribution ($\sim$ 65%) of optical phonons is
remarkably large. On the electrical side, the anisotropic electrical
conductivities are mainly due to the different effective masses of holes and
electrons along the $a$, $b$ and $c$ axes. This leads to the highest optimal
$ZT$ values along the $b$ axis and lowest ones along the $a$ axis in both
$p$-type materials. However, the $n$-type ones exhibit the highest $ZT$s along
the $a$ axis due to the enhancement of power factor when the chemical potential
gradually approaches the secondary band valley that causes significant increase
in electron mobility and density of states. SnSe exhibits larger optimal $ZT$s
compared with SnS in both $p$-type and $n$-type materials. For both materials,
the peak $ZT$s of $n$-type materials are much higher than those of $p$-type
ones along the same direction. The predicted highest $ZT$ values at 750 K are
1.0 in SnSe and 0.6 in SnS along the $b$ axis for the $p$-type doping while
those for the $n$-type doping reach 2.7 in SnSe and 1.5 in SnS along the $a$

Lennard-Jones-like pairwise interaction potential, taking hydrodynamic
interactions between the particles fully into account. By comparing the
hydrodynamic case with counterpart simulations for passive and active Brownian
particles, we elucidate the relative roles of self-propulsion, interparticle
attraction, and hydrodynamic interactions in determining clustering and phase
behaviour. Even in the presence of an attractive potential, we find that
hydrodynamic interactions strongly suppress the motility induced phase
separation that might a priori have been expected in a highly active
suspension. Instead, we find only a weak tendency for the particles to form
stringlike clusters in this regime. At lower activities we demonstrate phase
behaviour that is broadly equivalent to that of the counterpart passive system
at low temperatures, characterized by regimes of gas-liquid, gas-solid and
liquid-solid phase coexistence. In this way, we suggest that a dimensionless
quantity representing the level of activity relative to the strength of
attraction plays the role of something like an effective non-equilibrium
temperature, counterpart to the (dimensionless) true thermodynamic temperature
in the passive system. However there are also some important differences from
the equilibrium case, most notably with regards the degree of hexatic ordering,
which we discuss carefully.

Proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem and noncontextuality inequalities are two
means for revealing the contextuality phenomenon in quantum mechanics. It has
been found that some proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem, such as those based
on rays, can be converted to a state-independent noncontextuality inequality,
but it remains open whether it is true in general, i.e., whether any proof of
the Kochen-Specker theorem can always be converted to a noncontextuality
inequality. In this paper, we address this issue. We prove that all kinds of
proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem, based on rays or any other observables,
can always be converted to state-independent noncontextuality inequalities.
Besides, our constructive proof also provides a general approach for deriving a
state-independent noncontextuality inequality from a proof of the

luminosity of W33 - when combined with the direct detection of methanol masers,
the protostellar object W33A, and protocluster embedded within the radio source
W33 main - mark the region out as a site of vigorous ongoing star formation. In
order to assess the long term star formation history, we performed an infrared
spectroscopic search for massive stars, detecting for the first time fourteen
early-type stars, including one WN6 star and four O4-7 stars. The distribution
of spectral types suggests that this population formed during the last ~2-4
Myr, while the absence of red supergiants precludes extensive star formation at
ages 6-30 Myr. This activity appears distributed throughout the region and does
not appear to have yielded the dense stellar clusters that characterize other
star forming complexes such as Carina and G305. Instead, we anticipate that W33
will eventually evolve into a loose stellar aggregate, with Cyg OB2 serving as
a useful, albeit richer and more massive, comparator. Given recent distance
estimates, and despite a remarkably similar stellar population, the rich
cluster Cl 1813-178 located on the north-west edge of W33 does not appear to be
physically associated with W33.

univariate cumulants are used as projection indices in search for independent

jointly used to solve the problem. The properties of the estimates are

decodable network coding (IDNC) trigger the interest to extend them to more
complicated opportunistic network coding (ONC) scenarios, with limited increase
in complexity. In this paper, we design a simple IDNC-like graph model for a
specific subclass of ONC, by introducing a more generalized definition of its
vertices and the notion of vertex aggregation in order to represent the storage
of non-instantly-decodable packets in ONC. Based on this representation, we
determine the set of pairwise vertex adjacency conditions that can populate
this graph with edges so as to guarantee decodability or aggregation for the
vertices of each clique in this graph. We then develop the algorithmic
procedures that can be applied on the designed graph model to optimize any
performance metric for this ONC subclass. A case study on reducing the
completion time shows that the proposed framework improves on the performance
of IDNC and gets very close to the optimal performance.

accelerated without approximation into Presburger arithmetic constraints. The
constraints are obtained via symbolic execution and are satisfiable exactly if
the given program state is reachable. We summarize loops nested inside other
loops using recurrence relations derived from the inner loop's acceleration.
This summary abstracts the loop iteration parameter and may thus
overapproximate. An advantage of our symbolic approach is that the process of

equivalent. The equivalence requires an AdS geometry near the boundaries. The
$O(D,D)$ invariance is introduced into the Polyakov action by the Tseytlin's
action. Traditionally, there exist disconnected open-open or closed-closed
configurations in the solution space of the Tseytlin's action. The open-closed
configuration is ruled out by the mixed terms of the dual fields. We show that,
under some very general guidances, the dual fields are consistently decoupled
if and only if the near horizon geometry is $AdS_5$. We then have open-closed
and closed-open configurations in different limits of the distances of the
$D3$-brane pairs. Inherited from the definition of the theory, these four
configurations are of course related to each other by $O(D,D)$ transformations.
We therefore conclude that both the open/closed relation and open/closed
duality can be derived from $O(D,D)$ symmetries. We then demonstrate the
open/closed relation does connect commutative open and closed strings. By
analyzing the couplings of the configurations, the low energy effective limits
of our results consequently predicts the AdS/CFT correspondence, Higher spin
theory, weak gauge/weak gravity duality and a yet to be proposed strong
gauge/strong gravity duality. Furthermore, we also have the Seiberg duality and
a weak/strong gravitation duality as consequences of $O(D,D)$ symmetries.

applications of these equations are magnetised (Alfvenic) plasma turbulence and
magnetic reconnection. Viriato uses operator splitting (Strang or Godunov) to
separate the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field
(assumed strong). Along the magnetic field, Viriato allows for either a
second-order accurate MacCormack method or, for higher accuracy, a
spectral-like scheme composed of the combination of a total variation
diminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative with a
7th order upwind scheme for the fluxes. Perpendicular to the field Viriato is
pseudo-spectral, and the time integration is performed by means of an iterative
predictor-corrector scheme. In addition, a distinctive feature of Viriato is
its spectral representation of the parallel velocity-space dependence, achieved
by means of a Hermite representation of the perturbed distribution function. A

consequently its frequency, are sinusoidally modulated. By the proper choice of
the modulation parameters, as well as of the timing of pulse slicing, we can
produce a wide variety of frequency sweep ranges during the pulse. In order to
obtain the required frequency chirp, we need to stabilize the center frequency
of the modulated laser and to measure the resulting frequency evolution with
appropriate temporal resolution. These tasks have been solved by creating a
beat signal with a reference laser locked to an atomic transition frequency.
The beat signal is then analyzed, as well as its spectral sideband peaks are
fed back to the electronics of the frequency stabilization of the modulated

frequency sweep with narrow bandwidth that is appropriate, for example, for
selective manipulation of atomic states in a magneto-optical trap.

of 1200-1300 G in the lower tachocline are in perfect agreement with the time
scales of observed variations. The steady toroidal magnetic field can be
generated in the lower tachocline either due to the steady dynamo magnetic
field for low magnetic diffusivity or due to the action of the latitudinal
differential rotation on the weak poloidal primordial magnetic field, which
penetrates from the radiative interior. The slow magnetic Rossby waves lead to
variations of the steady toroidal magnetic field in the lower tachocline, which
modulate the dynamo magnetic field and consequently the solar cycle strength.

$C^*$-algebra whose representations are in one-to-one correspondence with

paper we present a new approach to host algebras for infinite dimensional Lie
groups which is based on smoothing operators, i.e., operators whose range is
contained in the space $\cH^\infty$ of smooth vectors. Our first major result
is a characterization of smoothing operators $A$ that in particular implies
smoothness of the maps $\pi^A \colon G \to B(\cH), g \mapsto \pi(g)A$. The
concept of a smoothing operator is particularly powerful for representations
$(\pi,\cH)$ which are semibounded, i.e., there exists an element $x_0 \in\g$
for which all operators $i\dd\pi(x)$, $x \in \g$, from the derived
representation are uniformly bounded from above in some neighborhood of $x_0$.
Our second main result asserts that this implies that $\cH^\infty$ coincides
with the space of smooth vectors for the one-parameter group $\pi_{x_0}(t) =
\pi(\exp tx_0)$. We then show that natural types of smoothing operators can be
used to obtain host algebras and that, for every metrizable Lie group, the
class of semibounded representations can be covered completely by host
algebras. In particular, it permits direct integral decompositions.

measurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as function of the
parameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented
into the PASTIS planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which
a blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation.
It might also produce a bisector variation anti-correlated with the radial
velocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width
half maximum variation provides complementary constraints. These results can be
used to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radial
velocity planets. We review all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in the
literature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. We
estimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. Based on
that, we recommend the use of BiGauss which is the most sensitive diagnosis to
monitor line-profile asymmetry. In this paper, we also investigate the
sensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop a
formalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. Finally, we
apply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of HD16702, an

their variability over all wavelengths. This property has been used in the past

  In this paper, we aim to construct and characterise an AGN sample using a
multi-epoch dataset in the r band from the SUDARE-VOICE survey.
  Our work makes use of the VST monitoring program of an area surrounding the
Chandra Deep Field South to select variable sources. We use data spanning a six
month period over an area of 2 square degrees, to identify AGN based on their
photometric variability.
  The selected sample includes 175 AGN candidates with magnitude r < 23 mag. We
distinguish different classes of variable sources through their lightcurves, as
well as X-ray, spectroscopic, SED, optical and IR information overlapping with
our survey.
  We find that 12% of the sample (21/175) is represented by SN. Of the
remaining sources, 4% (6/154) are stars, while 66% (102/154) are likely AGNs
based on the available diagnostics. We estimate an upper limit to the
contamination of the variability selected AGN sample of about 34%, but we point
out that restricting the analysis to the sources with available
multi-wavelength ancillary information, the purity of our sample is close to
80% (102 AGN out of 128 non-SN sources with multi-wavelength diagnostics). Our
work thus confirms the efficiency of the variability selection method in
agreement with our previous work on the COSMOS field; in addition we show that
the variability approach is roughly consistent with the infrared selection.

General Relativity, has been tested to a great level of detail, Grand Unified
Theories that combine gravity with the other three fundamental forces may
result in a violation of Lorentz symmetry at the Planck scale. These energies
are unattainable experimentally. However, minute deviations from Lorentz
invariance may still be present at much lower energies. These deviations can
accumulate over large distances, making astrophysical measurements the most
sensitive tests of Lorentz symmetry. One effect of Lorentz invariance violation
is an energy dependent photon dispersion of the vacuum resulting in differences
of the light travel time from distant objects. The Standard-Model Extension

fundamental Grand Unified Theory, including Lorentz and CPT violating terms. In
the SME the Lorentz violating operators can in part be classified by their
mass-dimension d, with the lowest order being d=5. However, measurements of
photon polarization have constrained operators with d=5 setting lower limits on
the energy at which they become dominant well beyond the Planck scale. On the

of the electric field in the sensor for different oxide-charge densities and
different boundary conditions at the sensor surface support this explanation.

important role in the shock dynamics and thermodynamics, especially at the
solar-wind termination shock. They react on the shock electric field in a very
specific way, leading to suprathermal nonequilibrium distributions of the
downstream electrons, which can be represented by a kappa distribution
function. In this paper, we discuss why this anticipated hot electron
population has not been seen by the plasma detectors of the Voyager spacecraft
downstream of the solar-wind termination shock. We show that hot nonequilibrium
electrons induce a strong negative electric charge-up of any spacecraft
cruising through this downstream plasma environment. This charge reduces
electron fluxes at the spacecraft detectors to nondetectable intensities.
Furthermore, we show that the Debye length $\lambda _{\mathrm D}^{\kappa}$
grows to values of about $\lambda _{\mathrm D}^{\kappa}/\lambda _{\mathrm
D}\simeq 10^{6}$ compared to the classical value $\lambda _{\mathrm D}$ in this
hot-electron environment. This unusual condition allows for the propagation of
a certain type of electrostatic plasma waves that, at very large wavelengths,
allow us to determine the effective temperature of the suprathermal electrons
directly by means of the phase velocity of these waves. At moderate
wavelengths, the electron-acoustic dispersion relation leads to nonpropagating
oscillations with the ion-plasma frequency $\omega _{\mathrm p}$ , instead of

requirement that kinetic energy generation is positive in the lower atmosphere
limits the poleward cell extension \$L\$ of Hadley cells via a relationship
between \$\Delta T_s\$ and surface pressure difference \$\Delta p_s\$: an upper
limit exists when \$\Delta p_s\$ does not grow with increasing \$\Delta T_s\$.
This pattern is demonstrated here using monthly data from MERRA re-analysis.
Kinetic energy generation along air streamlines in the boundary layer does not
exceed \$40\$~J~mol\$^{-1}\$; it declines with growing \$L\$ and reaches zero
for the largest observed \$L\$ at 2~km height. The limited meridional cell size
necessitates the appearance of heat pumps -- circulation cells with negative
work output where the low-level air moves towards colder areas. These cells
consume the positive work output of the heat engines -- cells where the
low-level air moves towards the warmer areas -- and can in theory drive the
global efficiency of atmospheric circulation down to zero. Relative
contributions of \$\Delta p_s\$ and \$\Delta T_s\$ to kinetic energy generation

combinations of candidate attendees and activity locations create a large
solution space. Thus, in this paper, we propose Multiple Rally-Point Social
Spatial Group Query (MRGQ), to select an appropriate activity location for a
group of nearby attendees with tight social relationships. Although MRGQ is
NP-hard, the number of attendees in practice is usually small enough such that
an optimal solution can be found efficiently. Therefore, we first propose an
Integer Linear Programming optimization model for MRGQ. We then design an
efficient algorithm, called MAGS, which employs effective search space
exploration and pruning strategies to reduce the running time for finding the
optimal solution. We also propose to further optimize efficiency by indexing
the potential activity locations. A user study demonstrates the strength of
using MAGS over manual coordination in terms of both solution quality and
efficiency. Experimental results on real datasets show that our algorithms can
process MRGQ efficiently and significantly outperform other baseline

insulator constrictions both in the integer and fractional regimes. In the
presence of a perpedicular magnetic field, the constriction functions as a spin
filter with near-perfect efficiency and can be switched by electric fields
only. Domain walls between different topological phases can be created in the
constriction as an interface between tunneling, magnetic fields, charge density
wave, or electron-electron interactions dominated regions. These domain walls
host non-Abelian bound states with fractional charge and spin and result in
degenerate ground states with parafermions. If a proximity gap is induced bound
states give rise to an exotic Josephson current with 8$\pi$-peridiodicity.

that few-layer C2N have a direct bandgap and the direct bandgap of the system
can vary from 2.47 eV for monolayer to 1.84 eV for a five-layer. Besides, for
the few-layer C2N, appropriate band gap, band edge alignments, and strong

provinces and glaciations, all of which have been considered as contributors to
mass extinctions. Understanding the overall relationship between the timings of
the largest extinctions and their potential proximal causes remains one of
science's great unsolved mysteries. Cycles of about 60 million years in both
fossil diversity and environmental data suggest external drivers such as the
passage of the Solar System through the galactic plane. While cyclic phenomena
are recognised statistically, a lack of coherent mechanisms and a failure to
link key events has hampered wider acceptance of multi-million year periodicity
and its relevance to earth science and evolution. The generation of a robust
predictive model of timings, with a clear plausible primary mechanism, would
signal a paradigm shift. Here, we present a model of the timings of globally
disruptive events and a possible explanation of their ultimate cause. The
proposed model is a symmetrical pattern of 63 million-year sequences around a
central value, interpreted as the occurrence of events along, and parallel to,
the galactic midplane. The symmetry is consistent with multiple dark matter
disks, aligned parallel to the midplane. One implication of the precise pattern
of timings and the underlying physical model is the ability to predict future
events, such as a major extinction in one to two million years.

  appear in Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We review a recently proposed Clifford-algebra approach to elementary
particles. We start with: (1) a philosophical background that motivates a
maximally symmetric treatment of position and momentum variables, and: (2) an
analysis of the minimal conceptual assumptions needed in quark mass extraction
procedures. With these points in mind, a variation on Born's reciprocity
argument provides us with an unorthodox view on the problem of mass. The idea
of space quantization suggests then the linearization of the nonrelativistic
quadratic form ${\bf p}^2 +{\bf x}^2$ with position and momentum satisfying
standard commutation relations. This leads to the 64-dimensional Clifford
algebra ${Cl}_{6,0}$ of nonrelativistic phase space within which one identifies
the internal quantum numbers of a single Standard Model generation of
elementary particles (i.e. weak isospin, hypercharge, and color). The relevant
quantum numbers are naturally linked to the symmetries of macroscopic phase
space. It is shown that the obtained phase-space-based description of
elementary particles gives a subquark-less explanation of the celebrated
Harari-Shupe rishon model. Finally, the concept of additivity is used to form
novel suggestions as to how hadrons are constructed out of quarks and how
macroscopically motivated invariances may be restored at the hadron level.

torrefaction. The mass yield decreased from 79.70 % to 43.03 %, energy yield
from 89.44 % to 64.27 % during torrefaction from 250 {\deg}C to 300 {\deg}C.
