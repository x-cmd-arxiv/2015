classic phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuit for carrier recovery, is a
challenging task. Thus for its analysis, simplified mathematical models and
numerical simulation are widely used. In this work a short survey on nonlinear
models of the BPSK Costas loop, used for pre-design and post-design analysis,
is presented. Their rigorous derivation and limitations of classic analysis are
discussed. It is shown that the use of simplified mathematical models, and the
application of non rigorous methods of analysis (e.g., simulation and
linearization) may lead to wrong conclusions concerning the performance of the
Costas loop physical model.

tribimaximal, we use a generalized Fridberg-Lee neutrino mass model along with
a complementary ansatz to incorporate a nonzero $\theta_{13}$ along with CP

In the second stage we add a perturbation with real components which breaks the
$\mu-\tau$ symmetry and this leads to a nonzero value for $\theta_{13}$. The
combination of these two generalizations leads to CP violation. Using only two
of the experimental data, we can fix all of the parameters of our model and
predict not only values for the other experimental data, which agree well with
the available data, but also the masses of neutrinos and the CP violating
phases and parameters. These predictions include the following: $\langle

For each edge $uv\in E(G)$, the {\bf edge multiplicity} of $uv$ in $G$ is given

that aims to attain homogeneity within time series data. This is accomplished
through partitioning the time series into a number of contiguous homogeneous
segments. The applications of such techniques range from identifying chromosome
alterations to solar flare detection. In this manuscript we present a general
purpose search algorithm called cp3o that can be used to identify change points
in multivariate time series. This new search procedure can be applied with a
large class of goodness of fit measures. Additionally, a reduction in the
computational time needed to identify change points is accomplish by means of
probabilistic pruning. With mild assumptions about the goodness of fit measure
this new search algorithm is shown to generate consistent estimates for both
the number of change points and their locations, even when the number of change
points increases with the time series length.
  A change point algorithm that incorporates the cp3o search algorithm and
E-Statistics, e-cp3o, is also presented. The only distributional assumption
that the e-cp3o procedure makes is that the absolute $\alpha$th moment exists,
for some $\alpha\in(0,2)$. Due to this mild restriction, the e-cp3o procedure
can be applied to a majority of change point problems. Furthermore, even with
such a mild restriction, the e-cp3o procedure has the ability to detect any

the dynamics of a system from its observed time series is key to the prediction
and control of the system's behavior. While most existing techniques tacitly
assume some form of stationarity or continuity, abrupt changes, which are often
due to external disturbances or sudden changes in the intrinsic dynamics, are
common in time series. Structural breaks, which are time points at which the
statistical patterns of a time series change, pose considerable challenges to
data analysis. Without identification of such break points, the same dynamic
rule would be applied to the whole period of observation, whereas false
identification of structural breaks may lead to overfitting. In this paper, we
cast the problem of decomposing a time series into its trend and seasonal
components as an optimization problem. This problem is ill-posed due to the
arbitrariness in the number of parameters. To overcome this difficulty, we
propose the addition of a penalty function (i.e., a regularization term) that
accounts for the number of parameters. Our approach simultaneously identifies
seasonality and trend without the need of iterations, and allows the reliable
detection of structural breaks. The method is applied to recorded data on fish
populations and sea surface temperature, where it detects structural breaks
that would have been neglected otherwise. This suggests that our method can
lead to a general approach for the monitoring, prediction, and prevention of
structural changes in real systems.

Customers form their own queue and are served in the first-come first-served

control problems under the long run average (ergodic) cost criteria in the

are considered: (i) both queueing and idleness costs are minimized, and (ii)
only the queueing cost is minimized while a constraint is imposed upon the
idleness of all server pools. We develop a recursive leaf elimination algorithm
that enables us to obtain an explicit representation of the drift for the
controlled diffusions. Consequently, we show that for the limiting controlled
diffusions, there always exists a stationary Markov control under which the
diffusion process is geometrically ergodic. The framework developed in our
earlier work is extended to address a broad class of ergodic diffusion control
problems with constraints. We show that that the unconstrained and constrained
problems are well posed, and we characterize the optimal stationary Markov

single node. If the nodes of the network are anonymous, the task of leader
election is formulated as follows: every node $v$ of the network must output a
simple path, coded as a sequence of port numbers, such that all these paths end
at a common node, the leader. In this paper, we study deterministic leader
election in anonymous trees.
  Our aim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\tau$ and the
amount of information that has to be given $\textit{a priori}$ to the nodes to
enable leader election in time $\tau$ in all trees for which leader election in
this time is at all possible. Following the framework of $\textit{algorithms
with advice}$, this information (a single binary string) is provided to all
nodes at the start by an oracle knowing the entire tree. The length of this
string is called the $\textit{size of advice}$. For an allocated time $\tau$,
we give upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to
perform leader election in time $\tau$.
  We consider $n$-node trees of diameter $diam \leq D$. While leader election
in time $diam$ can be performed without any advice, for time $diam-1$ we give
tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta (\log D)$. For time $diam-2$ we give
tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta (\log D)$ for even values of $diam$,
and tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta (\log n)$ for odd values of $diam$.
For the time interval $[\beta \cdot diam, diam-3]$ for constant $\beta >1/2$,
we prove an upper bound of $O(\frac{n\log n}{D})$ and a lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{n}{D})$, the latter being valid whenever $diam$ is odd or when
the time is at most $diam-4$. Finally, for time $\alpha \cdot diam$ for any
constant $\alpha <1/2$ (except for the case of very small diameters), we give
tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta (n)$.

accurately explain suppression measurements at 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC
and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. With the upcoming LHC measurements at
notably higher collision energies, there is a question of what differences,
with respect to the current (2.76 TeV) measurements, can be expected. In this
paper we concentrate on heavy flavor suppression at the upcoming 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb
collisions energy at the LHC. Naively, one would expect a notably ($\sim 30\%$)
larger suppression at 5.1 TeV collision energy, due to estimated (significant)
energy loss increase when transitioning from 2.76 to 5.1 TeV. Surprisingly,
more detailed calculations predict nearly the same suppression results at these
two energies. We show that this unexpected result is due to an interplay of the
following two effects, which essentially cancel each other: i) flattening of
the initial distributions with increasing collision energies, and ii)
significantly slower than naively expected increase in the energy loss.
Therefore, the obtained nearly the same suppression provides a clear
(qualitative and quantitative) test of our energy loss formalism.

the effects of individual variables can be difficult if latent effects and

hierarchical models based on a Poisson log-normal mixture to understand the
spatial variation in relative abundance (counts per standardized unit of
effort) of yellow perch, Perca flavescens, the most abundant fish species in
Lake Saint Pierre, Quebec, Canada. The mixture incorporates spatially varying
environmental covariates that represent local habitat characteristics, and
random temporal and spatial effects that capture the effects of unobserved
ecological processes. The sampling design covers the margins but not the
central region of the lake. We fit spatial generalized linear mixed models
based on three different prior covariance structures for the local latent
effects: a single Gaussian process (GP) over the lake, a GP over a circle, and
independent GP for each shore. The models allow for independence, isotropy, or
nonstationary spatial effects. Nonstationarity is dealt with using two
different approaches, geometric anisotropy, and the inclusion of covariates in
the correlation structure of the latent spatial process. The proposed
approaches for specification of spatial domain and choice of Gaussian process
priors may prove useful in other applications that involve spatial correlation
along an irregular contour or in discontinous spatial domains.

formed. In order to compare the stellar and gas response to the spiral arms, we

in our LBT/LMIRCam 3 - 5 micron AO imaging. Under the assumption this excess
emission is thermal, we find a color temperature of ~ 500 K is required, well
in excess of the emissivity-modified equilibrium temperature for typical
astrophysical dust. The nebular features of VY CMa are found to be highly
polarized (up to 60%) at 1.3 micron, again with optically thick scattering
required to reproduce the observed surface brightness. This star's peculiar
nebular feature dubbed the ""Southwest Clump"" is clearly detected in the 3.1
micron polarimetry as well, which, unlike IRC+10420, is consistent with
scattered light alone. The high intrinsic polarizations of both hypergiants'
nebulae are compatible with optically thick scattering for typical dust around
evolved dusty stars, where the depolarizing effect of multiple scatters is
mitigated by the grains' low albedos.

  Jupiter","Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 20 pages, 17 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter harbours two distinct groups of
asteroids. The short-lived population is known to be a transient group
sustained in steady state by the Yarkovsky semimajor axis drift. The long-lived
asteroids, however, can exhibit dynamical lifetimes comparable to
$4\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. They reside near two isolated islands of the phase space
denoted $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$, with an uneven population ratio
$\mathrm{B}/\mathrm{A} \simeq 10$. The orbits of $\mathrm{A}$-island asteroids
are predominantly highly inclined, compared to island $\mathrm{B}$. The
size-frequency distribution is steep but the orbital distribution lacks any
evidence of a collisional cluster. These observational constraints are somewhat
puzzling and therefore the origin of the long-lived asteroids has not been
explained so far.
  With the aim to provide a viable explanation, we first update the resonant
population and revisit its physical properties. Using an $N$-body model with
seven planets and the Yarkovsky effect included, we demonstrate that the
dynamical depletion of island $\mathrm{A}$ is faster, in comparison with island
$\mathrm{B}$. Then we investigate (i) the survivability of primordial resonant
asteroids and (ii) capture of the population during planetary migration,
following a recently described scenario with an escaping fifth giant planet and
a jumping-Jupiter instability. We also model the collisional evolution of the
resonant population over past $4\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. Our conclusion is that the
long-lived group was created by resonant capture from a narrow part of
hypothetical outer main-belt family during planetary migration. Primordial
asteroids surviving the migration were probably not numerous enough to
substantially contribute to the observed population.

subset of columns from an input matrix such that the input can be well
approximated by the span of the selected columns. Column subset selection has
been applied to numerous real-world data applications such as population
genetics summarization, electronic circuits testing and recommendation systems.
In many applications the complete data matrix is unavailable and one needs to
select representative columns by inspecting only a small portion of the input
matrix. In this paper we propose the first provably correct column subset
selection algorithms for partially observed data matrices. Our proposed
algorithms exhibit different merits and limitations in terms of statistical
accuracy, computational efficiency, sample complexity and sampling schemes,
which provides a nice exploration of the tradeoff between these desired
properties for column subset selection. The proposed methods employ the idea of
feedback driven sampling and are inspired by several sampling schemes
previously introduced for low-rank matrix approximation tasks (Drineas et al.,
2008; Frieze et al., 2004; Deshpande and Vempala, 2006; Krishnamurthy and
Singh, 2014). Our analysis shows that, under the assumption that the input data
matrix has incoherent rows but possibly coherent columns, all algorithms
provably converge to the best low-rank approximation of the original data as
number of selected columns increases. Furthermore, two of the proposed
algorithms enjoy a relative error bound, which is preferred for column subset
selection and matrix approximation purposes. We also demonstrate through both
theoretical and empirical analysis the power of feedback driven sampling
compared to uniform random sampling on input matrices with highly correlated
columns.

space. These measurements must then be communicated to a common location to be
compared, which is unavoidably noisy. While much is known about the limits of
measurement precision by cells, the limits placed by the communication are not
understood. Motivated by recent experiments, we derive the fundamental limits
to the precision of gradient sensing in a multicellular system, accounting for
communication and temporal integration. The gradient is estimated by comparing
a ""local"" and a ""global"" molecular reporter of the external concentration,
where the global reporter is exchanged between neighboring cells. Using the
fluctuation-dissipation framework, we find, in contrast to the case when
communication is ignored, that precision saturates with the number of cells
independently of the measurement time duration, since communication establishes
a maximum lengthscale over which sensory information can be reliably conveyed.
Surprisingly, we also find that precision is improved if the local reporter is
exchanged between cells as well, albeit more slowly than the global reporter.
The reason is that while exchange of the local reporter weakens the comparison,
it decreases the measurement noise. We term such a model ""regional
excitation--global inhibition"" (REGI). Our results demonstrate that fundamental
sensing limits are necessarily sharpened when the need to communicate
information is taken into account.

(3) Holling Type II functional responses between host and parasite, which are
particularly suitable for social parasites that face time costs for host
location and its social manipulation. We perform local and global analyses for
the co-evolutionary model and the corresponding ecological model. In the
absence of evolution, the facultative parasite system can have one, two, or
three interior equilibria, while the obligate parasite system can have either
one or three interior equilibria. Multiple interior equilibria result in rich
dynamics with multiple attractors. The ecological system, in particular, can
exhibit bi-stability between the facultative-parasite-only equilibrium and the
interior coexistence equilibrium when it has two interior equilibria. Our
findings suggest that: (a) The host and parasite can select different
strategies that may result in local extinction of one species. These strategies
can have convergence stability (CS), but may not be evolutionary stable
strategies (ESS); (b) The host and its facultative (or obligate) parasite can
have ESS that drive the host (or the obligate parasite) extinct locally; (c)
Trait functions play an important role in the CS of both boundary and interior

To this purpose, a new method is presented to delineate the trapping regions
using empirical diagrams of some orbital properties obtained in the Galactic

characteristic orbital energy versus a characteristic orbital angular momentum,
or versus the orbital Jacobi constant in the reference frame of the bar, when

several families of periodic orbits on the Galactic plane, some associated with

these resonances on the Galactic plane can extend several kpc from this plane,
trapping stars in the Galactic halo. The purpose of our analysis is to
investigate if the trapping regions contain some known moving groups in our

(IIT) of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the
information integrated in a system, called integrated information, $\Phi$.
Integrated information is defined theoretically as the amount of information a
system generates as a whole, above and beyond the sum of the amount of
information its parts independently generate. IIT predicts that the amount of
integrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness.
Empirical evaluation of this theory requires computing integrated information
from neural data acquired from experiments, although difficulties with using
the original measure $\Phi$ precludes such computations. Although some
practical measures have been previously proposed, we found that these measures
fail to satisfy the theoretical requirements as a measure of integrated
information. Measures of integrated information should satisfy the lower and
upper bounds as follows: The lower bound of integrated information should be 0
when the system does not generate information (no information) or when the
system comprises independent parts (no integration). The upper bound of
integrated information is the amount of information generated by the whole
system and is realized when the amount of information generated independently
by its parts equals to 0. Here we derive the novel practical measure $\Phi^*$
by introducing a concept of mismatched decoding developed from information
theory. We show that $\Phi^*$ is properly bounded from below and above, as
required, as a measure of integrated information. We derive the analytical
expression $\Phi^*$ under the Gaussian assumption, which makes it readily

improve the generalization performance of boosting learning. The key feature of
RBoosting lies in introducing a shrinkage degree to re-scale the ensemble
estimate in each gradient-descent step. Thus, the shrinkage degree determines
the performance of RBoosting.
  The aim of this paper is to develop a concrete analysis concerning how to
determine the shrinkage degree in $L_2$-RBoosting. We propose two feasible ways
to select the shrinkage degree. The first one is to parameterize the shrinkage
degree and the other one is to develope a data-driven approach of it. After
rigorously analyzing the importance of the shrinkage degree in $L_2$-RBoosting
learning, we compare the pros and cons of the proposed methods. We find that
although these approaches can reach the same learning rates, the structure of
the final estimate of the parameterized approach is better, which sometimes
yields a better generalization capability when the number of sample is finite.
With this, we recommend to parameterize the shrinkage degree of
$L_2$-RBoosting. To this end, we present an adaptive parameter-selection
strategy for shrinkage degree and verify its feasibility through both
theoretical analysis and numerical verification.

coronae are investigated with a reduced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in the
framework of Parker scenario for coronal heating. A novel analysis of reduced
MHD equilibria shows that their magnetic fields have an asymmetric structure in
the axial direction with variation length-scale $z_\ell \sim \ell B_0/b$, where
$B_0$ is the intensity of the strong axial guide field, $b$ that of the
orthogonal magnetic field component, and $\ell$ the scale of $\mathbf{b}$.
Equilibria are then quasi-invariant along the axial direction for variation
scales larger than approximatively the loop length $z_\ell \gtrsim L_z$, and
increasingly more asymmetric for smaller variation scales $z_\ell \lesssim
L_z$. The $critical$ $length$ $z_\ell \sim L_z$ corresponds to the magnetic
field intensity threshold $b \sim \ell B_0/L_z$. Magnetic fields stressed by
photospheric motions cannot develop strong axial asymmetries. Therefore fields
with intensities below such threshold evolve quasi-statically, readjusting to a
nearby equilibrium, without developing nonlinear dynamics nor dissipating
energy. But stronger fields cannot access their corresponding asymmetric
equilibria, hence they are out-of-equilibrium and develop nonlinear dynamics.
The subsequent formation of current sheets and energy dissipation is
$necessary$ for the magnetic field to relax to equilibrium, since dynamically
accessible equilibria have variation scales larger than the loop length $z_\ell
\gtrsim L_z$, with intensities smaller than the threshold $b \lesssim \ell
B_0/L_z$. The dynamical implications for magnetic fields of interest to solar
and stellar coronae are investigated numerically and the impact on coronal
physics discussed.

that the dominant contributor on the wrinkled shape changes from bending

the droplet curvature radius of the order of the cell-size, i.e., tens of

less complete review of ""exotic"" dark particle searches with other accelerators

especially model-independently,a discovery of a DM particle with an
accelerator, or collider. One can only obtain evidence on existence of a weakly
interacting neutral particle, which could be, or could not be the DM candidate.
The current LHC DM search program uses only the missing transverse energy
signature. Non-observation of any excess above Standard Model expectations
forces the LHC experiments to enter into the same fighting for the best
exclusion curve, in which (almost) all direct and indirect DM search
experiments permanently take place. But this fighting has very little (almost
nothing) to do with a real possibility of discovering a DM particle. The true
DM particles possess an exclusive galactic signature --- annual modulation of a
signal, which is accessible today only for direct DM detection experiments.
There is no way for it with a collider, or accelerator. Therefore to prove the
DM nature of a collider-discovered candidate one must find the candidate in a
direct DM experiment and demonstrate the galactic signature for the candidate.
Furthermore, being observed, the DM particle must be implemented into a modern
theoretical framework. The best candidate is the supersymmetry, which looks
today inevitable for coherent interpretation of all available DM data.

CSP$(P)$ instance $I$ over $n$ variables with $m$ constraints. When $m \gg n$
the instance $I$ will be unsatisfiable with high probability, and we want to
find a refutation - i.e., a certificate of unsatisfiability. When $P$ is the
$3$-ary OR predicate, this is the well studied problem of refuting random
$3$-SAT formulas, and an efficient algorithm is known only when $m \gg
n^{3/2}$. Understanding the density required for refutation of other predicates
is important in cryptography, proof complexity, and learning theory.
Previously, it was known that for a $k$-ary predicate, having $m \gg n^{\lceil
k/2 \rceil}$ constraints suffices for refutation. We give a criterion for
predicates that often yields efficient refutation algorithms at much lower
densities. Specifically, if $P$ fails to support a $t$-wise uniform
distribution, then there is an efficient algorithm that refutes random CSP$(P)$
instances $I$ whp when $m \gg n^{t/2}$. Indeed, our algorithm will ""somewhat
strongly"" refute $I$, certifying $\mathrm{Opt}(I) \leq 1-\Omega_k(1)$, if $t =
k$ then we get the strongest possible refutation, certifying $\mathrm{Opt}(I)
\leq \mathrm{E}[P] + o(1)$. This last result is new even in the context of
random $k$-SAT. Regarding the optimality of our $m \gg n^{t/2}$ requirement,
prior work on SDP hierarchies has given some evidence that efficient refutation
of random CSP$(P)$ may be impossible when $m \ll n^{t/2}$. Thus there is an
indication our algorithm's dependence on $m$ is optimal for every $P$, at least
in the context of SDP hierarchies. Along these lines, we show that our
refutation algorithm can be carried out by the $O(1)$-round SOS SDP hierarchy.
Finally, as an application of our result, we falsify assumptions used to show
hardness-of-learning results in recent work of Daniely, Linial, and
Shalev-Shwartz.

evaluated exactly for special values of the the moduli of the auxiliary
geometry, where the integrand simplifies. We also perform a similar analysis

T^2 is very simple, the dependence on the complex structure of the T^2 is quite
intricate. In some of the cases, the amplitude consists of terms each of which
factorizes into a product of two SL(2,Z) invariant modular forms. While one of
the factors is a non--holomorphic Eisenstein series, the other factor splits
into a sum of modular forms each of which satisfies a Poisson equation on
moduli space with source terms that are bilinear in the Eisenstein series. This
leads to several possible perturbative contributions unto genus 5 in type II
string theory on S^1. Unlike the one and two loop supergravity analysis, these
amplitudes also receive non--perturbative contributions from bound states of
three D--(anti)instantons in the IIB theory.

parameterization that is robust to both receiver and source variations with the
following salient features: (i) The parameterization is given in terms of a
modal expansion of 3D basis functions. (ii) The aforementioned modal expansion
can be truncated at a finite number of modes given that the source and receiver
locations are from two sizeable spatial regions, which are arbitrarily
distributed. (iii) The parameter weights/coefficients are independent of the

be capable of accurately calculating the RTF between any two arbitrary points

spatial region where the receiver(s) lie. A practical method to measure the RTF
coefficients is also provided, which only requires a single microphone unit and
a single loudspeaker unit, given that the room characteristics remain
stationary over time. The accuracy of the above parameterization is verified

ultracold atoms. Based on contemporary technology, motion along a synthetic
fourth dimension can be accomplished through controlled transitions between
internal states of atoms arranged in a 3D optical lattice. From a
semi-classical analysis, we identify the linear and non-linear quantized
current responses of our 4D model, relating these to the topology of the Bloch
bands. We then propose experimental protocols, based on current or
center-of-mass-drift measurements, to extract the topological 2nd Chern number.
Our proposal sets the stage for the exploration of novel topological phases in
higher dimensions.

quadrature nodes and weights are, considered as a higher-dimensional point, a

continuously deformed by modifying the source knot vector, the quadrature rule

by deriving the optimal rules for uniform $C^2$ cubic spline spaces where the

the resulting quadrature rule is independent of the path chosen between the
target and the source knot vectors as well as the source rule chosen.

holds also for almost every fixed frequency under a certain generalization of
the Hannan condition and a certain rotated form of the Maxwell and Woodroofe
condition which, under a condition of weak dependence that we specify, is

our results describe the asymptotic distributions of the normalized discrete

  We prove also that under a certain regularity hypothesis the conditional
centering is irrelevant for averaged frequencies, and that the same holds for a

necessarily under the generalized Hannan condition. In particular, this implies
that the hypothesis of regularity is not sufficient for functional convergence

Nanodevices, or, more precisely, memory or memristive devices, have been
proposed for the implementation of synaptic functions, offering the required

that the basic physics involved in the filamentary switching of electrochemical
metallization cells can reproduce important biological synaptic functions that

short- to long-term plasticity has been reported as a direct consequence of
filament growth (i.e., increased conductance) in filamentary memory devices. In
this paper, we show that a more complex filament shape, such as dendritic paths
of variable density and width, can permit the short- and long-term processes to
be controlled independently. Our solid-state device is strongly analogous to
biological synapses, as indicated by the interpretation of the results from the
framework of a phenomenological model developed for biological synapses. We
describe a single memristive element containing a rich panel of features, which

width, while maintaining an average signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at
each receiver as a constant. We then identify fundamental operating regimes
characterized according to the beam width scaling and analyze throughput
scaling laws for each of the regimes. The elastic routing is shown to achieve a
much better throughput scaling law than that of the conventional
nearest-neighbor multihop for all operating regimes. The gain comes from the
fact that more source--destination pairs can be simultaneously activated as the
beam width becomes narrower, which eventually leads to a linear throughput
scaling law. In addition, our framework is applied to a hybrid network
consisting of both wireless ad hoc nodes and infrastructure nodes. As a result,
in the hybrid network, we analyze a further improved throughput scaling law and

treatment of time-dependent chemistry and account for the highly non-isothermal
nature of the gas and the dust. We model clouds with a total mass of 1.3x10^5
M_{sun} and explore the effects of varying the mean cloud density and the
virial parameter, alpha = E_{kin}/|E_{pot}|. We vary the latter from alpha =
0.5 to alpha = 8.0, and so many of the clouds that we simulate are
gravitationally unbound. We expose our model clouds to an interstellar
radiation field (ISRF) and cosmic ray flux (CRF) that are both a factor of 1000
higher than the values found in the solar neighbourhood. As a reference, we
also run simulations with local solar neighbourhood values of the ISRF and the
CRF in order to better constrain the effects of the extreme conditions in the
GC on the SFE. Despite the harsh environment and the large turbulent velocity
dispersions adopted, we find that all of the simulated clouds form stars within
less than a gravitational free-fall time. Increasing the virial parameter from
alpha = 0.5 to alpha = 8.0 decreases the SFE by a factor ~4-10, while
increasing the ISRF/CRF by a factor of 1000 decreases the SFE again by a factor
~2-6. However, even in our most unbound clouds, the SFE remains higher than
that inferred for real GC clouds. We therefore conclude that high levels of
turbulence and strong external heating are not enough by themselves to lead to
a persistently low SFE at the center of the Galaxy.

introduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they
can both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hinge-loss
Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model
that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three
approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and
fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference
objective. We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The
second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic
programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on
first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable
variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than
general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to
take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the
parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous
discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable

counting detectors based on solid-state semiconductor avalanche photodiodes
operated in Geiger mode. Level of afterpulsing depends mainly on type of the
semiconductor, doping concentrations and temperature and presents an additional
source of noise, along with dark counts. Unlike dark counts which appear
randomly in time, aterpulses and are time-correlated with the previous
detections. For measurements that rely on timing information afterpulsing can
create fake signals and diminish the sensitivity. In this work we test a novel
broadband sensitive APD that was designed for sub-Geiger avalanche gain
operation. We find that this APD, which has a reach-through geometry typical of
single-photon detection photodiodes, can also operate in Geiger mode with
usable detection sensitivity and acceptable dark counts level while exhibiting
uniquely low afterpulsing. The afterpulsing of tested samples was
systematically less than 0.05 percent at 10V excess voltage.

processes, where each process is described as an extended state machine along
with fairness assumptions, and its correctness is specified using safety and
liveness requirements. Designing correct distributed protocols is a challenging
task. Aimed at simplifying this task, we allow the designer to leave some of
the guards and updates to state variables in the description of extended state
machines as unknown functions. The protocol completion problem then is to find
interpretations for these unknown functions while guaranteeing correctness. In
many distributed protocols, process behaviors are naturally symmetric, and
thus, synthesized expressions are further required to obey symmetry
constraints. Our counterexample-guided synthesis algorithm consists of
repeatedly invoking two phases. In the first phase, candidates for unknown
expressions are generated using the SMT solver Z3. This phase requires
carefully orchestrating constraints to enforce the desired symmetry in
read/write accesses. In the second phase, the resulting completed protocol is
checked for correctness using a custom-built model checker that handles
fairness assumptions, safety and liveness requirements, and exploits symmetry.
When model checking fails, our tool examines a set of counterexamples to
safety/liveness properties to generate constraints on unknown functions that
must be satisfied by subsequent completions. For evaluation, we show that our
prototype is able to automatically discover interesting missing details in
distributed protocols for mutual exclusion, self stabilization, and cache
coherence.

on the Fridberg-Lee neutrino mass model at a special point. In this case, the
Fridberg-Lee model reduces to the Democratic mass matrix with the $S_3$
permutation family symmetry. The Democratic mass matrix has an experimentally
unfavored degenerate mass spectrum on the base of tribimaximal mixing matrix.
We rescue the model to find a nondegenerate mass spectrum by adding the
breaking mass term as preserving the twisted Fridberg-Lee symmetry. The
tribimaximal mixing matrix can be also realized. Exact tribimaximal mixing
leads to $\theta_{13}=0$. However, the results from Daya Bay and RENO
experiments have established a nonzero value for $\theta_{13}$. Keeping the
leading behavior of $U$ as tribimaximal, we use Broken Democratic neutrino mass
model. We characterize a perturbation mass matrix which is responsible for a
nonzero $\theta_{13}$ along with CP violation, besides the solar neutrino mass
splitting has been resulted from it. We consider this work in two stages: In
the first stage, we obtain the perturbation mass matrix with real components
which breaks softly the $\mu-\tau$ symmetry and this leads to a nonzero value
for $\theta_{13}$. In the second stage, we extend the perturbation mass matrix
to a complex symmetric matrix which leads to CP violation. Therefore obtain a
realistic neutrino mixing matrix with $\theta_{23}=45^\circ$. We obtain the
solar mass splitting, the ordering of the neutrino masses is inverted. Using
only two sets of the experimental data, we can fix all of the parameters of
mass matrix and predict the masses of neutrinos and phases. These predictions
include the following: $m_{1}\approx(4.82-4.93)10^{-2}eV $,
$|m_2|\approx(4.90-5.01)10^{-2} eV$, $m_3\approx0$ and,

be due to the long-range temporal correlation among the measurements, however
the contribution of a fat-tail distribution function of the variables is not
negligible. The existence of long-range correlation is also confirmed by the
constancy of the local slopes of the fluctuation function over a sufficient
scale intervals. The results of the moving average analysis are found to depend
upon the location of the detrending window and tend to the observations of the
multifractal detrended analysis for a specific choice of the location of the
