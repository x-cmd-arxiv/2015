optical parametric oscillators with mutual injections. The cavity mode in the
optical coupling path between the two oscillator facets is explicitly
considered. Stochastic equations for the oscillators and mutual injection path
based on the positive $P$ representation are derived. The system of two
gradually pumped oscillators with out-of-phase mutual injections is simulated,
and its quantum state is investigated. When the incoherent loss of the
oscillators other than the mutual injections is small, the squeezed quadratic
amplitudes $\hat{p}$ in the oscillators are positively correlated near the
oscillation threshold. It indicates finite quantum correlation, estimated via
Gaussian quantum discord, and the entanglement between the intracavity
subharmonic fields. When the loss in the injection path is low, each oscillator
around the phase transition point forms macroscopic superposition even under a
small pump noise. It suggests that the squeezed field stored in the low-loss
injection path weakens the decoherence in the oscillators.

enables chemical cross-linking (XL) to become a high-throughput method for
obtaining structural information about proteins. Restraints derived from XL-MS
experiments have been used successfully for structure refinement and
protein-protein docking. However, one formidable question is under which
circumstances XL-MS data might be sufficient to determine a protein's tertiary
structure de novo? Answering this question will not only include understanding
the impact of XL-MS data on sampling and scoring within a de novo protein
structure prediction algorithm, it must also determine an optimal cross-linker
type and length for protein structure determination. While a longer
cross-linker will yield more restraints, the value of each restraint for
protein structure prediction decreases as the restraint is consistent with a
larger conformational space.
  In this study, the number of cross-links and their discriminative power was
systematically analyzed in silico on a set of 2,055 non-redundant protein folds
considering Lys-Lys, Lys-Asp, Lys-Glu, Cys-Cys, and Arg-Arg reactive
cross-linkers between 1 {\AA} and 60 {\AA}. Depending on the protein size a
heuristic was developed that determines the optimal cross-linker length. Next,
simulated restraints of variable length were used to de novo predict the
tertiary structure of fifteen proteins using the BCL::Fold algorithm. The
results demonstrate that a distinct cross-linker length exists for which
information content for de novo protein structure prediction is maximized. The
sampling accuracy improves on average by 1.0 {\AA} and up to 2.2 {\AA} in the
most prominent example. XL-MS restraints enable consistently an improved
selection of native-like models with an average enrichment of 2.1.

likelihood for stationary Markov random field models, when the data locations
fall on a complete regular grid, and the model has no additive error term. The
calculations rely on the availability of the covariances. We prove a theorem
giving the rate of convergence of a spectral method of computing the
covariances, establishing that the error decays faster than any polynomial in
the size of the computing grid. We extend the exact likelihood calculations to
the case of non-rectangular domains and missing values on the interior of the
grid and to the case when an additive uncorrelated error term (nugget) is
present in the model. We also give an alternative formulation of the likelihood
that has a smaller memory burden, parts of which can be computed in parallel.
We show in simulations that using the exact likelihood can give far better
parameter estimates than using standard Markov random field approximations.
Having access to the exact likelihood allows for model comparisons via
likelihood ratios on large datasets, so as an application of the methods, we
compare several state-of-the-art methods for large spatial datasets on an
aerosol optical thickness dataset. We find that simple block independent
likelihood and composite likelihood methods outperform stochastic partial
differential equation approximations in terms of computation time and returning

(HCG) reflectors for TM and TE polarizations is presented, covering various
grating parameters and properties of HCGs. It is shown that the HCG reflectors
for TM polarization (TM HCG reflectors) have much thicker grating thicknesses
and smaller grating periods than the TE HCG reflectors. This difference is
found to originate from the different boundary conditions met for the electric
field of each polarization. Due to this difference, the TM HCG reflectors have
much shorter evanescent extension of HCG modes into low-refractive-index media
surrounding the HCG. This enables to achieve a very short effective cavity
length for VCSELs, which is essential for ultrahigh speed VCSELs and
MEMS-tunable VCSELs. The obtained understandings on polarization dependences
will be able to serve as important design guidelines for various HCG-based

computer vision has a wide range of applications, ranging from industrial
bottles filling to the automation of chemistry laboratory. One of the main
challenges in such recognition is the ability to distinguish between image
features resulting from the vessels surface and image features resulting from
the material inside the vessel. Reflections and the functional parts of a
vessels surface can create strong edges that can be mistakenly identified as
corresponding to the vessel contents, and cause recognition errors. The ability
to evaluate whether a specific edge in an image stems from the vessels surface
or from its contents can considerably improve the ability to identify materials
inside transparent vessels. This work will suggest a method for such
evaluation, based on the following two assumptions: 1) Areas of high curvature
on the vessel surface are likely to cause strong edges due to changes in
reflectivity, as is the appearance of functional parts (e.g. corks or valves).
2) Most transparent vessels (bottles, glasses) have high symmetry
(cylindrical). As a result the curvature angle of the vessels surface at each
point of the image is similar to the curvature angle of the contour line of the
vessel in the same row in the image. These assumptions, allow the
identification of image regions with strong edges corresponding to the vessel
surface reflections. Combining this method with existing image analysis methods
for detecting materials inside transparent containers allows considerable
improvement in accuracy.

galaxies and the dark matter haloes they inhabit, and therefore contains a
wealth of information about galaxy formation. We construct a general framework
to investigate whether models based on halo abundance matching are able to
reproduce the observed stellar mass TFR and mass-size relation (MSR), and use
the data to constrain galaxy formation parameters. Our model tests a range of
plausible scenarios, differing in the response of haloes to disc formation, the
relative angular momentum of baryons and dark matter, the impact of selection
effects, and the abundance matching parameters. We show that agreement with the
observed TFR puts an upper limit on the scatter between galaxy and halo
properties, requires weak or reversed halo contraction, and favours selection
effects that preferentially eliminate fast-rotating galaxies. The MSR
constrains the ratio of the disc to halo specific angular momentum to be
approximately in the range 0.6-1.2. We identify and quantify two problems that
models of this nature face. (1) They predict too large an intrinsic scatter for
the MSR, and (2) they predict too strong an anticorrelation between the TFR and
MSR residuals. We argue that resolving these problems requires introducing a
correlation between stellar surface density and enclosed dark matter mass.
Finally, we explore the expected difference between the TFRs of central and
satellite galaxies, finding that in the favoured models this difference should
be detectable in a sample of ~700 galaxies.

4\, M_\odot$ and no neutron stars with masses greater than $\sim\! 2\,
M_\odot$, creating a gap in the observed distribution of compact star masses.
Some black holes with masses between 2 and $4\, M_\odot$ might be hiding among
other X-ray sources, whose masses are difficult to measure. We present new
high-speed optical photometry of the low-mass X-ray binary V1408 Aql (= 4U
1957+115), which is a persistent X-ray source thought to contain a black hole.
The optical light curve of V1408~Aql shows a nearly sinusoidal modulation at
the orbital period of the system superimposed on large night-to-night
variations in mean intensity. We combined the new photometry with
previously-published photometry to derive a more precise orbital period, $P =
0.388893(3)$\ d, and to better define the orbital light curve and
night-to-night variations. The orbital light curve agrees well with a model in
which the modulation is caused entirely by the changing aspect of the heated
face of the secondary star. The lack of eclipses rules out orbital inclinations
greater than $65^{\circ}$. Our best models for the orbital light curve favor
inclinations near $13^{\circ}$ and black hole masses near $3\, M_\odot$ with a
90\% upper bound of $6.2\, M_\odot$, and a lower bound of $2.0\, M_\odot$
imposed solely by the maximum mass of neutron stars. We favor a black hole
primary over a neutron star primary based on evidence from the X-ray spectra,
the high spin of the compact object, and the fact that a type I X-ray burst has
not been observed for this system. Although uncertainties in the data and the
models allow higher masses, possibly much higher masses, the compact star in
V1408~Aql is a viable candidate for a black hole lying in the mass gap.

specific elaboration of our extension of the induced gravity model in the
Jordan frame, which corresponds to a linear potential of $\Phi$. The dynamical
system is then reduced to a two dimensional one, and the late-time attractor is
linked with the exact solution found for the induced gravity model. In this
example the intermediate accelerated solution does not exist, and the attractor
solution has an asymptotic de Sitter-like evolution law for the scale factor.
Apart from some fine-tuned examples such as the linear, and quadratic potential
${U}(\Phi)$ in the Jordan frame, it is true that intermediate accelerated

plays a key role for reducing the harmful emissions due, instead, to the use of
traditional vehicles. The starting point of this research is represented by the
fact that the advanced recent technologies for the EVs allow also partially
recharging their batteries. In this work, an Electric Vehicle Routing Problem
with Time Windows (E-VRPTW) is addressed from a time effective point of view
under the assumption that partial recharges are also allowed. For this purpose,
the E-VRPTW is mathematically formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program in
which both the total number of EVs used and the total time spent by them
outside the depot are minimized. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, a
Variable Neighborhood Search Branching (VNSB) matheuristic is also designed for
determining good quality solutions in reasonable computational times. Numerical
results carried out on some benchmark instances taken from the literature
provide useful insights regarding both the solution quality of the proposed

characteristics of a topological algebra, whereas for topological groups,

purely topological property as it is is equivalent to the underlying
topological space being a Stone space.
  Condensing the core idea of those classical results, we introduce the concept
of affine boundedness for an arbitrary universal algebra and show that for an
affinely bounded topological algebra over a compact signature profiniteness is
equivalent to the underlying topological space being a Stone space. Since
groups, semigroups, rings, and distributive lattices are indeed affinely
bounded algebras over finite signatures, all these known cases arise as special
instances of our result. Furthermore, we present some additional applications
concerning topological semirings and their modules, as well as distributive
associative algebras. We also deduce that any affinely bounded simple compact
algebra over a compact signature is either connected or finite. Towards proving
the main result, we also establish that any topological algebra is profinite if
and only if its underlying space is a Stone space and its translation monoid is
equicontinuous.

both for decoding information and for harvesting energy, which is employed to
power its circuitry. In the scenario where the receiver has limited battery
size, a signal with bursty energy content may cause power outage at the
receiver since the battery will drain during intervals with low signal energy.
In this paper, we consider a discrete memoryless channel and characterize
achievable information rates when the energy content in each codeword is
regularized by ensuring that sufficient energy is carried within every subblock
duration. In particular, we study constant subblock-composition codes (CSCCs)
where all subblocks in every codeword have the same fixed composition, and this
subblock-composition is chosen to maximize the rate of information transfer
while meeting the energy requirement. Compared to constant composition codes
(CCCs), we show that CSCCs incur a rate loss and that the error exponent for
CSCCs is also related to the error exponent for CCCs by the same rate loss
term. We show that CSCC capacity can be improved by allowing different
subblocks to have different composition while still meeting the subblock energy
constraint. We provide numerical examples highlighting the tradeoff between
delivery of sufficient energy to the receiver and achieving high information
transfer rates. It is observed that the ability to use energy in real-time
imposes less of penalty than the ability to use information in real-time.

paramaterized as scatter in Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax i.e.the ratio of the rotation
velocity measured at 1kpc and the maximum measured rotation velocity. We
examine whether the observed scatter can be accounted for by combining scatters
in disc scale-lengths, the concentration-halo mass relation, and the M*-Mhalo
relation. We use these scatters to create model galaxy populations; when housed
within dark matter halos that have universal, NFW density profiles, the model
does not match the lowest observed values of Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax and has too little
scatter in Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax compared to observations. By contrast, a model using
a mass dependent dark matter profile, where the inner slope is determined by
the ratio of M*/Mhalo, produces galaxies with low values of Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax and
a much larger scatter, both in agreement with observation. We conclude that the
large observed scatter in Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax favours density profiles that are
significantly affected by baryonic processes. Alternative dark matter core
formation models such as SIDM may also account for the observed variation in
rotation curve shapes, but these observations may provide important constraints
in terms of core sizes, and whether they vary with halo mass and/or merger
history.

increase (over 50-fold) was found for the 2D transition. The observed energy
shifts of the G and 2D bands allowed to determine carrier concentration
fluctuations induced by GaN nanowires. Comparison of Raman scattering spatial
intensity maps and the images obtained using scanning electron microscope led
to conclusion that vertically aligned GaN nanowires induce a homogenous strain,
substantial spatial modulation of carrier concentration in graphene and
unexpected homogenous distribution of defects created by interaction with
nanowires. The analysis of the D and D' peak intensity ratio showed that
interaction with nanowires also changes the probability of scattering on
different types of defects. The Raman studies were correlated with weak
localization effect measured using microwave induced contactless electron
transport. Temperature dependence of weak localization signal showed
electron-electron scattering as a main decoherence mechanism with additional,
temperature independent scattering reducing coherence length. We attributed it
to the interaction of electrons in graphene with charges present on the top of
nanowires due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization of GaN. Thus,
nanowires act as antennas and generate enhanced near field which can explain
the observed large enhancement of Raman scattering intensity.

employ error estimators and adaptive mesh refinement strategies in order to
reduce the computational cost.
  We can extend these techniques to general vectors by splitting the vectors
into a hierarchically organized partition of subsets and using appropriate
bases to represent the corresponding parts of the vectors. This leads to the
concept of \emph{hierarchical vectors}.
  A hierarchical vector with $m$ subsets and bases of rank $k$ requires $mk$
units of storage, and typical operations like the evaluation of norms and inner
products or linear updates can be carried out in $\mathcal{O}(mk^2)$
operations.
  Using an auxiliary basis, the product of a hierarchical vector and an
$\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix can also be computed in $\mathcal{O}(mk^2)$ operations,
and if the result admits an approximation with $\widetilde m$ subsets in the
original basis, this approximation can be obtained in
$\mathcal{O}((m+\widetilde m)k^2)$ operations. Since it is possible to compute
the corresponding approximation error exactly, sophisticated error control
strategies can be used to ensure the optimal compression.
  Possible applications of hierarchical vectors include the approximation of
eigenvectors and the solution of time-dependent problems with moving local
irregularities.

experiments on two large-scale social network datasets.

  Benchmarking Framework",,,,,"cs.MM cs.CR cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Benchmarking digital watermarking algorithms is not an easy task because
different applications of digital watermarking often have very different sets
of requirements and trade-offs between conflicting requirements. While there
have been some general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking systems
available, they normally do not support complicated benchmarking tasks and
cannot be easily reconfigured to work with different watermarking algorithms
and testing conditions. In this paper, we propose OR-Benchmark, an open and
highly reconfigurable general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking
framework, which has the following two key features: 1) all the interfaces are
public and general enough to support all watermarking applications and
benchmarking tasks we can think of; 2) end users can easily extend the
functionalities and freely configure what watermarking algorithms are tested,
what system components are used, how the benchmarking process runs, and what
results should be produced. We implemented a prototype of this framework as a
MATLAB software package and used it to benchmark a number of digital
watermarking algorithms involving two types of watermarks for content
authentication and self-restoration purposes. The benchmarking results
demonstrated the advantages of the proposed benchmarking framework, and also
gave us some useful insights about existing image authentication and
self-restoration watermarking algorithms which are an important but less
studied topic in digital watermarking.

$\lambda_{\max}$ of random $N \times N$ matrices belonging to the Gaussian
$\beta$-ensemble of random matrix theory, including in particular the Gaussian
orthogonal ($\beta=1$), unitary ($\beta=2$) and symplectic ($\beta = 4$)
ensembles. We focus on two distinct quantities: (i) the density of states (DOS)
near $\lambda_{\max}$, $\rho_{\rm DOS}(r,N)$, which is the average density of
eigenvalues located at a distance $r$ from $\lambda_{\max}$ (or the density of
eigenvalues seen from $\lambda_{\max}$) and (ii) the probability density
function of the gap between the first two largest eigenvalues, $p_{\rm
GAP}(r,N)$. Using heuristic arguments as well as well numerical simulations, we
generalize our recent exact analytical study of the Hermitian case
(corresponding to $\beta = 2$). We also discuss some applications of these two
quantities to statistical physics models.

(ASD), timely and evidence-driven public policy decision making and
communication of the latest guidelines pertaining to the treatment and
management of the disorder is crucial. Yet evidence suggests that policy makers
and medical practitioners do not always have a good understanding of the
practices and relevant beliefs of ASD-afflicted individuals' carers who often
follow questionable recommendations and adopt advice poorly supported by
scientific data. The key goal of the present work is to explore the idea that
Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information exchange, could be used
as a data-mining source to learn about the population affected by ASD -- their
behaviour, concerns, needs etc. To this end, using a large data set of over 11
million harvested tweets as the basis for our investigation, we describe a
series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects
of messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of
their nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate
additional research on this topic and present a methodological basis for
further work.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) when the combined effects of the central gravity
and anisotropic radiation pressure and the drag force are considered. Physical
properties of the intercloud gas such as its pressure and dynamic viscosity are
defined as power-law functions of the radial distance. For a drag force
proportional to the relative velocity of a cloud and the background gas, a
detailed analysis of the orbits is performed for different values of the input
parameters. We also present analytical solutions for a situation where the
intercloud pressure is uniform and the viscosity is proportional to the inverse
square of the radial distance. Our analytical and numerical solutions
demonstrate decay of the orbits because of considering the drag force so that a
cloud will eventually fall onto the central region after so called
time-of-flight. We found that time-of-flight of a BLR cloud is proportional to
the inverse of the dimensionless drag coefficient. We discuss if time-of-flight
becomes shorter than the life time of the whole system, then existence of
mechanisms for continually forming BLR clouds is needed.

links the quasi distributions defined in terms of spacelike correlators at
finite nucleon momentum to the light-cone distributions, and is useful for
extracting the latter from the former in a lattice QCD calculation. Our results
show that at one-loop and leading power accuracy the matching for the
light-cone generalized quark distribution $H$ ($\tilde H$) is non-trivial,
whereas no matching is required for $E$ ($\tilde E$). Therefore, $E$ ($\tilde
E$) can be smoothly approached by its quasi counterpart in the large momentum
limit. We also present the matching for the distribution amplitude of the pion.
