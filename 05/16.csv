show that the multi-tracer estimators are unbiased, and that their covariance
is given by the inverse of the multi-tracer Fisher matrix (Abramo, MNRAS 2013;
Abramo & Leonard, MNRAS 2013). When the biases, RSDs and NGs are fixed to their
fiducial values, and one is only interested in measuring the underlying power
spectrum, our estimators are projected into the estimator found by Percival,
Verde & Peacock (MNRAS 2003). We have tested our estimators on simple

being either equivalent or superior to the FKP method in all cases we analyzed.

emissivity is unable to fully reionize the Universe at $z\sim 6$. Either a high
escape fraction of ionizing photons from these galaxies or a large population
of faint galaxies below the detection limit are required. However, these
requirements are somewhat in tension with present observations. In this work,
we explored the combined contribution of mini-quasars and stars to the
reionization of cosmic hydrogen and helium. Our model is roughly consistent
with: (1) the low escape fractions of ionizing photons from the observed
galaxies, (2) the optical depth of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measured
by the WMAP-7, and (3) the redshift of the end of hydrogen and helium
reionization at $z\approx 6$ and $z\approx 3$, respectively. Neither an
extremely high escape fraction nor a large population of fainter galaxies is
required in this scenario. In our most optimistic model, more than $\sim20\%$
of the cosmic helium is reionized by $z\sim6$, and the ionized fraction of
cosmic helium rapidly climbs to more than $50\%$ by $z\sim5$. These results may
imply that better measurements of helium reionization, especially at high
redshifts, could be helpful in constraining the growth of intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs) in the early Universe, which would shed some light on the
puzzles concerning the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs).

superconducting cavities, external ports, and voltage sources. Our technique,
an extension of our previous work on single-port structures [1], permits the
derivation of system Hamiltonians that are capable of representing every
feature of the physical system over a wide frequency band and the computation
of T1 times for qubits. We begin with a black box model of the linear and
passive part of the system. Its response is given by its multiport impedance
function Zsim(w), which can be obtained using a finite-element electormagnetics
simulator. The ports of this black box are defined by the terminal pairs of
Josephson junctions, voltage sources, and 50 Ohm connectors to high-frequency
lines. We fit Zsim(w) to a positive-real (PR) multiport impedance matrix Z(s),
a function of the complex Laplace variable s. We then use state-space
techniques to synthesize a finite electric circuit admitting exactly the same
impedance Z(s) across its ports; the PR property ensures the existence of this
finite physical circuit. We compare the performance of state-space algorithms
to classical frequency domain methods, justifying their superiority in
numerical stability. The Hamiltonian of the multiport model circuit is obtained
by using existing lumped element circuit quantization formalisms [2, 3]. Due to
the presence of ideal transformers in the model circuit, these quantization
methods must be extended, requiring the introduction of an extension of the
Kirchhoff voltage and current laws.

attribute name, we use crowdsourced image labels to discover the latent factors

structure in those latent factors helps reveal shades, that is, interpretations

train classifiers to capture the primary (often subtle) variants of the
attribute. The resulting models are both semantic and visually precise. By
catering to users' interpretations, they improve attribute prediction accuracy
on novel images. Shades also enable more successful attribute-based image

our understanding of quasar structure and dynamics. The observed different
redshift among broad hydrogen lines is still an amazing puzzle in the study of
quasars. We have argued that the broad hydrogen lines, as well as the
low-ionization lines in quasars, are significantly contributed by the Cerenkov
quasi-line emission of the fast electrons in the dense clouds/filaments/sheets
($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{14}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$); whereas this line-like radiation
mechanism is invalid for producing the high ionization lines. In order to
account for redshift difference, the Cerenkov line-like radiation mechanism
could provide a plausible resolution: it is the `Cerenkov line redshift', which
is different from line to line, causes the peculiar redshift-differences among
Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. The different redshifts among
different broad hydrogen lines could stand for an evidence to quantitatively
support that the observed broad hydrogen lines should be blended by both the
real line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission. The good fitting to
the observed redshifts of quasars confirms the existence of Cerenkov component
in the broad hydrogen lines, which indicates that, in the blended Ly$\alpha$
line, the line-intensity of the Cerenkov component approximately equals that of
the accompanying `normal line' (an approximate equipartition of intensity
between the two components in the broad Ly$\alpha$ line). This result
illustrates the importance of the Cerenkov component in the broad lines of
quasars, which can be further confirmed by future observations.

translocate along singlestranded nucleic acid and couple the motion to
unwinding double-strands of a duplex nucleic acid. The junction between double
and single strands creates a barrier to the movement of the helicase, which can
be manipulated in vitro by applying mechanical forces directly on the nucleic
acid strands. Single molecule experiments have demonstrated that the unwinding
velocities of some helicases increase dramatically with increase in the
external force, while others show little response. In contrast, the unwinding
processivity always increases when the force increases. The differing responses
of the unwinding velocity and processivity to force has lacked explanation. By
generalizing a previous model of processive unwinding by helicases, we provide
a unified framework for understanding the dependence of velocity and
processivity on force and the nucleic acid sequence. We predict that the
sensitivity of unwinding processivity to external force is a universal feature
that should be observed in all helicases. Our prediction is illustrated using
T7 and NS3 helicases as case studies. Interestingly, the increase in unwinding
processivity with force depends on whether the helicase forces base pair
opening by direct interaction or if such a disruption occurs spontaneously due
to thermal uctuations. Based on the theoretical results, we propose that
proteins like single-strand binding proteins associated with helicases in the
replisome, may have co-evolved with helicases to increase the unwinding
processivity even if the velocity remains unaffected.

geometry may differ.
  Motivated by object recognition literature and recent work on rapidly
estimating linear classifiers, we treat semantic correspondence as a

given an initial configuration on a space-like hypersurface, it makes a
definite prediction of the final configuration. Recent developments suggest
that gravity may be described in terms of macroscopic parameters. It finds a
concrete manifestation in the fluid-gravity correspondence. Most of the efforts
till date has been to relate equilibrium configurations in gravity with fluid
variables. In order for the emergent paradigm to be truly successful, it has to
provide a statistical mechanical derivation of how a given initial static
configuration evolves into another. In this essay, we show that the energy
transport equation governed by the fluctuations of the horizon-fluid is similar
to Raychaudhuri equation and, hence gravity is truly emergent.

removal in observations of the 21-cm signal with interferometers. The
technique, which we call HIEMICA (HI Expectation-Maximization Independent
Component Analysis), is an extension of the Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) technique developed for two-dimensional (2D) CMB maps to
three-dimensional (3D) 21-cm cosmological signals measured by interferometers.
This technique provides a fully Bayesian inference of power spectra and maps
and separates the foregrounds from signal based on the diversity of their power
spectra. Only relying on the statistical independence of the components, this
approach can jointly estimate the 3D power spectrum of the 21-cm signal and,
the 2D angular power spectrum and the frequency dependence of each foreground
component, without any prior assumptions about foregrounds. This approach has
been tested extensively by applying it to mock data from interferometric 21-cm
intensity mapping observations under idealized assumptions of instrumental
effects. We also discuss the impact when the noise properties are not known
completely. As a first step toward solving the 21 cm power spectrum analysis
problem we compare the semi-blind HIEMICA technique with the commonly used
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Under the same idealized circumstances the
proposed technique provides significantly improved recovery of the power
spectrum. This technique can be applied straightforwardly to all 21-cm
interferometric observations, including epoch of reionization measurements, and
can be extended to single-dish observations as well.

measure the CP asymmetry parameters -eta_f S = +0.66 +/- 0.10 (stat.) +/- 0.06

from the availability of mobile broadband communications in disaster and
emergency scenarios. While undoubtedly offering full control and reliability,
dedicated networks for PPDR have resulted in high operating costs and a lack of
innovation in comparison to the commercial domain. Driven by the many benefits
of broadband communications, PPDR operators are increasingly interested in
adopting mainstream commercial technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE)
in favour of expensive, dedicated narrow-band networks.
  In addition, the emergence of virtualization for wireless networks offers a
new model for sharing infrastructure between several operators in a flexible
and customizable manner. In this context, we propose a virtual Public Safety
(PS) operator that relies on shared infrastructure of commercial LTE networks
to deliver services to its users. We compare several methods of allocating
spectrum resources between virtual operators at peak times and examine how this
influences differing traffic services. We show that it is possible to provide
services to the PS users reliably during both normal and emergency operation,

representation. We show that the phase transition of the nearest-neighbor
ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on $\mathbb Z^2$ is continuous for
$q\in\{2,3,4\}$, in the sense that there exists a unique Gibbs state, or
equivalently that there is no ordering for the critical Gibbs states with
monochromatic boundary conditions. The proof uses the random-cluster model with
cluster-weight $q\ge1$ (note that $q$ is not necessarily an integer) and is
based on two ingredients:
  1. The fact that the two-point function for the free state decays
sub-exponentially fast for cluster-weights $1\le q\le 4$, which is derived
studying parafermionic observables on a discrete Riemann surface.
  2. A new result proving the equivalence of several properties of critical
random-cluster models:
  - the absence of infinite-cluster for wired boundary conditions,
  - the uniqueness of infinite-volume measures,
  - the sub-exponential decay of the two-point function for free boundary
conditions,
  - a Russo-Seymour-Welsh type result on crossing probabilities in rectangles
with arbitrary boundary conditions.
  The result leads to a number of consequences concerning the scaling limit of
the random-cluster model with $1\le q \le 4$. It shows that the family of
interfaces (for instance for Dobrushin boundary conditions) are tight when
taking the scaling limit and that any sub-sequential limit can be parametrized
by a Loewner chain. We also study the effect of boundary conditions on these
sub-sequential limits. Let us mention that the result should be instrumental in
the study of critical exponents as well.

in the case of the alkaline iron selenides. Compared to the iron pnictides,
these systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but
comparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in
reconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:
a node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation
spectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate
pairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and
the other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign
across the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting
intermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \times
\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading
spin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state
retains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal
$\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space. Within a five-orbital $t-J_{1}-J_{2}$
model with orbital-selective exchange couplings, we show that the proposed
pairing state is energetically competitive over a finite range of control
parameters. We calculate the dynamical spin susceptibility in the
orbital-selective $s \times \tau_3$ superconducting state and show that a spin
resonance arises and has the characteristics of observed by inelastic neutron
experiments in the alkaline iron selenides. More generally, the formation of
the orbital-selective $s \times \tau_3$ state represents a novel means of
relieving the quasi-degeneracy between $s-$ and $d-$wave pairing states, which
is a hitherto unsuspected alternative to the conventional route of linearly
superposing the two into a time-reversal symmetry breaking $s+id$ state.

for being prolific producers of dust which causes their large iconic declines
in brightness. Several RCB stars, including R CrB, itself, have large extended
dust shells seen in the far-infrared. The origin of these shells is uncertain
but they may give us clues to the evolution of the RCB stars. The shells could
form in three possible ways. 1) they are fossil Planetary Nebula (PN) shells,
which would exist if RCB stars are the result of a final, helium-shell flash,
2) they are material left over from a white-dwarf merger event which formed the
RCB stars, or 3) they are material lost from the star during the RCB phase.
Arecibo 21-cm observations establish an upper limit on the column density of H
I in the R CrB shell implying a maximum shell mass of $\lesssim$0.3
M$_{\odot}$. A low-mass fossil PN shell is still a possible source of the shell
although it may not contain enough dust. The mass of gas lost during a
white-dwarf merger event will not condense enough dust to produce the observed
shell, assuming a reasonable gas-to-dust ratio. The third scenario where the
shell around R CrB has been produced during the star's RCB phase seems most
likely to produce the observed mass of dust and the observed size of the shell.
But this means that R CrB has been in its RCB phase for $\sim$10$^{4}$ yr.

while away from the interface the majority of electrons reside in $xz/yz$
bands. As the thickness of the SrTiO$_3$ layers decreases or the on-site
interaction U increases a metal-insulator transition occurs. Two different
insulating states are found. When the number of SrTiO$_{3}$ layers is larger
than one, we find an insulating state with two sublattice charge and orbital
ordering and associated Ti-O bond length disproportionations. When the number
of SrTiO$_{3}$ units per layer is one, a different insulating phase occurs
driven by orbital ordering within the quasi one-dimensional $xz/yz$ bonding
bands connecting Ti atoms across the SrO layer. In this phase there is no
sublattice charge ordering or bond disproportionation. The critical U for the

generally give rise to potentially large flavour-violating effects. Unless
there are suppressions, the size of the resulting off-diagonal terms in the

$\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei probe the size of the
potential flavour non-diagonality of the higher-order terms for realistic

higher-order corrections in terms of a small parameter $\epsilon$. By analysing
various textures for the higher-order corrections, we find current bounds on
$\epsilon$ from the LFV processes. The constraint from the neutral kaon mass
difference $\Delta m_K$ is currently similar to that from $\mu \to e \gamma$.
Measurement or new limits on the process $\mu \to e \gamma$ and, in the future,
$\mu \to e$ conversion in Aluminium, will be an effective probe of the form of
the higher-order K\""ahler potential terms. For the preferred range of gravitino

scale mass, whose couplings to the Standard Model (SM) are however too small to
give rise to the observed abundance. Instead, the abundance is set by
annihilation to light hidden sector states that carry no charges under the SM
gauge interactions. In such a scenario the constraints from direct and indirect
detection, and from collider searches for dark matter, can easily be satisfied.
The masses of such light hidden states can be protected by symmetry if they are
Nambu-Goldstone bosons, fermions, or gauge bosons. These states can then
contribute to the cosmic energy density as dark radiation, leading to
observable signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Furthermore,
depending on whether or not the light hidden sector states self-interact, the
fraction of the total energy density that free-streams is either decreased or
increased, leading to characteristic effects on both the scalar and tensor
components of the CMB anisotropy that allows these two cases to be
distinguished. The magnitude of these signals depends on the number of light
degrees of freedom in the hidden sector, and on the temperature at which it
kinetically decouples from the SM. We consider a simple model that realizes
this scenario, based on a framework in which the SM and hidden sector are
initially in thermal equilibrium through the Higgs portal, and show that the
resulting signals are compatible with recent Planck results, while large enough
to be detected in upcoming experiments such as CMBPol and CMB Stage-IV.
Invisible decays of the Higgs into hidden sector states at colliders can offer
a complementary probe of this model.

derive a tractable model of evidence accumulation when the correct option

MinGreedy cannot improve on the trivial approximation ratio 1/2 whp., even for
bipartite graphs. Our hard inputs seem to require a small number of high-degree

  This motivates an investigation of greedy algorithms on graphs with maximum
degree D: We show that MinGreedy achieves a (D-1)/(2D-3)-approximation for

graphs with maximum degree D. Interestingly, our bounds even hold for the
deterministic MinGreedy that breaks all ties arbitrarily.
  Moreover, we investigate the limitations of the greedy paradigm, using the
model of priority algorithms introduced by Borodin, Nielsen, and Rackoff. We
study deterministic priority algorithms and prove a
(D-1)/(2D-3)-inapproximability result for graphs with maximum degree D; thus,
these greedy algorithms do not achieve a 1/2+eps-approximation and in
particular the 2/3-approximation obtained by the deterministic MinGreedy for
D=3 is optimal in this class. For k-uniform hypergraphs we show a tight
1/k-inapproximability bound. We also study fully randomized priority algorithms

some resource to a user selected from a collection of distributed users with
the goal of maximizing the utility the user would receive from the resource.
This can be modeled as the controller computing an extremum of the distributed
users' utilities. The overhead rate necessary to enable the controller to
reproduce the users' local state can be prohibitively high. An approach to
reduce this overhead is interactive communication wherein rate savings are
achieved by tolerating an increase in delay. In this paper, we consider the
design of a simple achievable scheme based on successive refinements of scalar
quantization at each user. The optimal quantization policy is computed via a
dynamic program and we demonstrate that tolerating a small increase in delay
can yield significant rate savings. We then consider two simpler quantization
policies to investigate the scaling properties of the rate-delay trade-offs.
Using a combination of these simpler policies, the performance of the optimal
policy can be closely approximated with lower computational costs.

next-generation photovoltaic applications. The long carrier lifetime and
diffusion length of these materials make them very attractive for use in light
absorbers and carrier transporters. While these aspects of organometal halide
perovskites have attracted the most attention, the consequences of the Rashba
effect, driven by strong spin-orbit coupling, on the photovoltaic properties of
these materials are largely unexplored. In this work, taking the electronic
structure of methylammonium lead iodide as an example, we propose an intrinsic
mechanism for enhanced carrier lifetime in 3D Rashba materials. Based on
first-principles calculations and a Rashba spin-orbit model, we demonstrate
that the recombination rate is reduced due to the spin-forbidden transition.
These results are important for understanding the fundamental physics of
organometal halide perovskites and for optimizing and designing the materials
with better performance. The proposed mechanism including spin degrees of
freedom offers a new paradigm of using 3D Rashba materials for photovoltaic
applications.

At least 492 central stars of Galactic planetary nebulae (CSPNs)
have been assigned spectral types. Since many CSPNs are faint, these
classification efforts are frequently made at low spectral resolution. However,
the stellar Balmer absorption lines are contaminated with nebular emission;
therefore in many cases a low-resolution spectrum does not enable the
determination of the H abundance in the CSPN photosphere. Whether or not the
photosphere is H deficient is arguably the most important fact we should expect
to extract from the CSPN spectrum, and should be the basis for an adequate
spectral classification system.
  Aims. Our purpose is to provide accurate spectral classifications and
contribute to the knowledge of central stars of planetary nebulae and stellar
evolution.
  Methods. We have obtained and studied higher quality spectra of CSPNs
described in the literature as weak emission-line star (WELS). We provide
descriptions of 19 CSPN spectra. These stars had been previously classified at
low spectral resolution. We used medium-resolution spectra taken with the
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). We provide spectral types in the
Morgan-Keenan (MK) system whenever possible.
  Results. Twelve stars in our sample appear to have normal H rich photospheric
abundances, and five stars remain unclassified. The rest (two) are most
probably H deficient. Of all central stars described by other authors as WELS,
we find that at least 26% of them are, in fact, H rich O stars, and at least 3%
are H deficient. This supports the suggestion that the denomination WELS should
not be taken as a spectral type, because, as a WELS based on low-resolution
spectra, it cannot provide enough information about the photospheric H
abundance.

study of their intersection. First, inspired by a recent optimization algorithm
that was adaptive to unknown uniform convexity parameters, we present a new
active learning algorithm for one-dimensional thresholds that can yield minimax
rates by adapting to unknown noise parameters. Next, we show that one can
perform $d$-dimensional stochastic minimization of smooth uniformly convex
functions when only granted oracle access to noisy gradient signs along any
coordinate instead of real-valued gradients, by using a simple randomized
coordinate descent procedure where each line search can be solved by
$1$-dimensional active learning, provably achieving the same error convergence
rate as having the entire real-valued gradient. Combining these two parts
yields an algorithm that solves stochastic convex optimization of uniformly
convex and smooth functions using only noisy gradient signs by repeatedly
performing active learning, achieves optimal rates and is adaptive to all
unknown convexity and smoothness parameters.

an oracle returns the corresponding label $Y$. In this paper, we consider the
effect of feature noise in active learning, which could arise either because
$X$ itself is being measured, or it is corrupted in transmission to the oracle,
or the oracle returns the label of a noisy version of the query point. In
statistics, feature noise is known as ""errors in variables"" and has been
studied extensively in non-active settings. However, the effect of feature
noise in active learning has not been studied before. We consider the
well-known Berkson errors-in-variables model with additive uniform noise of
width $\sigma$.
  Our simple but revealing setting is that of one-dimensional binary
classification setting where the goal is to learn a threshold (point where the
probability of a $+$ label crosses half). We deal with regression functions
that are antisymmetric in a region of size $\sigma$ around the threshold and
also satisfy Tsybakov's margin condition around the threshold. We prove minimax
lower and upper bounds which demonstrate that when $\sigma$ is smaller than the
minimiax active/passive noiseless error derived in \cite{CN07}, then noise has
no effect on the rates and one achieves the same noiseless rates. For larger
$\sigma$, the \textit{unflattening} of the regression function on convolution
with uniform noise, along with its local antisymmetry around the threshold,
together yield a behaviour where noise \textit{appears} to be beneficial. Our
key result is that active learning can buy significant improvement over a
passive strategy even in the presence of feature noise.

which assumes that the underlying world is finite and thus only considers the
finite completions of the instance. The major known decidable cases of FQA
derive from the following: the guarded fragment of first-order logic, which can
express referential constraints (data in one place points to data in another)

referential constraints and number restrictions for arbitrary signatures: we
show that, for unary inclusion dependencies and functional dependencies, the

Keating and collaborators that generated quasar mid-infrared spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), and explored their properties (such as geometry, opening
angle, and ionic column densities) as a function of Eddington ratio and X-ray
weakness. In addition, we present new models with a range of magnetic field
strengths and column densities of the dust-free shielding gas interior to the
dusty wind. We find this family of models -- with input parameters tuned to
accurately match the observed mid-IR power in quasar SEDs -- provides
reasonable values of the Type 1 fraction of quasars and the column densities of
warm absorber gas, though it does not explain a purely luminosity-dependent
covering fraction for either. Furthermore, we provide predictions of the
cumulative distribution of E(B-V) values of quasars from extinction by the wind
and the shape of the wind as imaged in the mid-infrared. Within the framework
of this model, we predict that the strength of the near-infrared bump from hot
dust emission will be correlated primarily with L/L_Edd rather than luminosity
alone, with scatter induced by the distribution of magnetic field strengths.
The empirical successes and shortcomings of these models warrant further
investigations into the composition and behaviour of dust and the nature of

allocation in wireless small cell networks (SCNs) with device-to-device (D2D)

the wireless and social context of wireless users for optimizing the overall
allocation of resources and improving traffic offload in SCNs. This
context-aware resource allocation problem is formulated as a matching game in
which user equipments (UEs) and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another, based
on utility functions that capture both wireless and social metrics. Due to
social interrelations, this game is shown to belong to a class of matching
games with peer effects. To solve this game, a novel, selforganizing algorithm
is proposed, using which UEs and RBs can interact to decide on their desired
allocation. The proposed algorithm is then proven to converge to a two-sided
stable matching between UEs and RBs. The properties of the resulting stable
outcome are then studied and assessed. Simulation results using real social
data show that clustering of socially connected users allows to offload a
substantially larger amount of traffic than the conventional context-unaware
approach. These results show that exploiting social context has high practical
relevance in saving resources on the wireless links and on the backhaul.

observations of gamma-ray emission from CR interactions with interstellar gas,
have been employed to directly probe the CR densities in distant locations

tracing the distribution of CR nuclei in the halo for the first time. We find
that the gamma-ray emissivity per H atom decreases with increasing distance

we estimate the lower limit on the bulk Lorentz factor with the flare duration

spin-dependent splitting in photonic spin Hall effect. The weak measurement is
only valid when the probe wavefunction remains almost undisturbed during the
procedure of measurements. However, it does not always satisfy such condition
in some practical situations, such as in the strong-coupling regime or the
preselected and postselected states are nearly orthogonal. In this paper, we
develop a modified weak measurement for detecting photonic spin Hall effect
when the probe wavefunction is distorted. We find that the measuring procedure
with preselected and postselected ensembles is still effective. This scheme is
important for us to detect the photonic spin Hall effect in the case where
neither weak nor strong measurements can detect the spin-dependent splitting.
The modified theory is valid not only in weak-coupling regime but also in the
strong-coupling regime, and especially in the intermediate regime. The
theoretical models of conventional weak measurements and modified weak
measurements are established and compared. We show that the experimental
results coincide well with the predictions of the modified theory.

Bhaumik and Ghosal (2014b) remedied this by directly considering the distance
between the function in the nonparametric model and a Runge-Kutta (RK$4$)
approximate solution of the ODE while inducing the posterior distribution on
the parameter. They also studied the direct Bayesian method obtained from the

show that they are intimately connected to the boxy-peanut shape of the
density. We highlight the imprint due solely to resonant orbits on the
kinematic landscape towards the Galactic centre. The resonant orbits are shown
to have distinct kinematic features and may be used to explain the cold
velocity peak seen in the APOGEE commissioning data (Nidever at al., 2012). We
show that high velocity peaks are a natural consequence of the motions of stars
in the 2:1 orbit family and that stars on other higher order resonances can
contribute to the peaks. The locations of the peaks vary with bar angle and,
with the tacit assumption that the observed peaks are due to the 2:1 family, we
find that the locations of the high velocity peaks correspond to bar angles in
the range 10 < theta_bar < 25 (deg). However, some important questions about
the nature of the peaks remain, such as their apparent absence in other surveys
of the Bulge and the deviations from symmetry between equivalent fields in the
north and south. We show that the absence of a peak in surveys at higher
latitudes is likely due to the combination of a less prominent peak and a lower
number density of bar supporting orbits at these latitudes.

model, a kind of the coordinate distribution of the photons hitting a pixel of
the CCD frame is known a priori, while the associated parameters are determined
from a real digital object image. The developed method, being more flexible in
adapting to any form of the object image, has a high measurement accuracy along
with a low calculating complexity due to a maximum likelihood procedure, which
is implemented to obtain the best fit instead of a least-squares method and
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for the minimisation of the quadratic form.
  Since 2010, the method was tested as the basis of our CoLiTec (Collection

applied to solve structured convex optimization problems due to its superior
practical performance. The convergence properties of the 2-block ADMM have been
studied extensively in the literature. Specifically, it has been proven that
the 2-block ADMM globally converges for any penalty parameter $\gamma>0$. In
this sense, the 2-block ADMM allows the parameter to be free, i.e., there is no
need to restrict the value for the parameter when implementing this algorithm
in order to ensure convergence. However, for the 3-block ADMM, Chen \etal
\cite{Chen-admm-failure-2013} recently constructed a counter-example showing
that it can diverge if no further condition is imposed. The existing results on
studying further sufficient conditions on guaranteeing the convergence of the
3-block ADMM usually require $\gamma$ to be smaller than a certain bound, which
is usually either difficult to compute or too small to make it a practical
algorithm. In this paper, we show that the 3-block ADMM still globally
converges with any penalty parameter $\gamma>0$ if the third function $f_3$ in
the objective is smooth and strongly convex, and its condition number is in
$[1,1.0798)$, besides some other mild conditions. This requirement covers an
important class of problems to be called regularized least squares

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) images show that the spiral arm-like gas

that the dominant part of the $\sim$0.6 pc scale massive molecular clump

several 0.5-1 pc size molecular arms spiraling around it, which may be
connected further to exterior gas accretion streams. Within G33.92+0.11 A, we
resolved the $\sim$0.1 pc width gas mini-arms connecting with the two central
massive (100-300 $M_{\odot}$) molecular cores. The kinematics of arms and cores
elucidate a coherent accretion flow continuing from large to small scales. We
demonstrate that the large molecular arms are indeed the cradles of dense
cores, which are likely current or future sites of high-mass star formation.
Since these deeply embedded massive molecular clumps preferentially form the
highest mass stars in the clusters, we argue that dense cores fed by or formed

relativistic electrons. Toward this end, we perform DSA simulations of
spherical shocks with the parameters relevant for the Sausage radio relic in
cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301, and calculate the ensuing radio synchrotron emission
from re-accelerated electrons. Three types of fossil electron populations are
considered: a delta-function like population with the shock injection momentum,
a power-law distribution, and a power-law with an exponential cutoff. The
surface brightness profile of radio-emitting postshock region and the

We find that the observed width of the Sausage relic can be explained
reasonably well by shocks with speed $u_s \sim 3\times 10^3 \kms$ and sonic
Mach number $M_s \sim 3$. These shocks produce curved radio spectra that
steepen gradually over $(0.1-10) \nu_{\rm br}$ with break frequency $ \nu_{\rm

geometric conditions, namely: (a) they preserve the class of vector fields
tangent to holonomic submanifolds of a jet space; (b) they leave invariant the
action, from which the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived, modulo terms
identically vanishing along holonomic submanifolds. Such correspondence between
symmetries and conservation laws is built on an explicit linear map f_A from
the vector fields satisfying (a) and (b) into the conserved differential
operators, and not into their divergences as it occurs in other proofs of
Noether Theorem. This map f_A is not new: it is the map determined by
contracting symmetries with a form of Poincare'-Cartan type A and it is
essentially the same considered for instance in a paper by Kupershmidt. There
it was shown that f_A determines a bijection between symmetries and

that belongs to the image of f_A, proving that the corresponding induced map
F_A between equivalence classes of symmetries and equivalence classes of

IRAS 19135+3937, an SRd variable with an infra-red excess indicative of a dusty
disc. A time-series of high-resolution spectra, UBV photometry as well as a
very accurate light curve obtained by the Kepler satellite, allowed us to study
the object in unprecedented detail. We discovered it to be a binary with a
period of 127 days. The primary has a low surface gravity and an atmosphere
depleted in refractory elements. This combination of properties unambiguously
places IRAS 19135+3937 in the subclass of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars
with dusty discs.
  We show that the light variations in this object can not be due to
pulsations, but are likely caused by the obscuration of the primary by the
circumbinary disc during orbital motion. Furthermore, we argue that the
double-peaked Fe emission lines provide evidence for the existence of a gaseous
circumbinary Keplerian disc inside the dusty disc. A secondary set of
absorption lines has been detected near light minimum, which we attribute to
the reflected spectrum of the primary on the disc wall, which segregates due to
the different Doppler shift. This corroborates the recent finding that
reflection in the optical by this type of discs is very efficient. The system
also shows a variable Halpha profile indicating a collimated outflow
originating around the companion. IRAS 19135+3937 thus encompasses all the
major emergent trends about evolved disc systems, that will eventually help to
place these objects in the evolutionary context.

a prototype to illustrate general features of PT-symmetric open quantum
systems; however, the potential could be mimicked by a number of recent PT
experiments. One key feature is the resonance in continuum (RIC), which appears
in both the discrete spectrum and scattering spectrum. The RIC forms a standing
wave extending throughout the spatial extent of the system, representing a
resonance between the open environment and the central PT-symmetric potential.
We illustrate that as one deforms the system parameters, the RIC may exit the
continuum by splitting into a bound state and a virtual bound state at the band
edge, a process that should be experimentally observable. We also study the
exceptional points (EPs) at which two eigenvalues coalesce; we categorize these
as either EP2As, at which two real-valued solutions coalesce before becoming
complex-valued, or EP2Bs, for which the two solutions are complex on either
side of the EP. The EP2As are associated with PT-symmetry breaking; we argue
that these are more stable against parameter perturbation than the EP2Bs. We
also study complex-valued solutions of the discrete spectrum for which the wave
function is nevertheless spatially localized, something not allowed in
traditional open quantum systems; we illustrate that these may form quasi-bound
states in continuum (QBICs) under some circumstances. We also study the

cancer cells within the body of the tumour that exhibits stem cell-like
properties. These cells are termed Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs}, and as opposed to
the more usual Differentiated Cancer Cells (DCCs), they exhibit higher
motility, they are more resilient to therapy, and are able to metastasize to
secondary locations within the organism and produce new tumours. The origin of
the CSCs is not completely clear; they seem to stem from the DCCs via a
transition process related to the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) that
can also be found in normal tissue.
  In the current work we model and numerically study the transition between
these two types of cancer cells, and the resulting ""ensemble"" invasion of the
extracellular matrix. This leads to the derivation and numerical simulation of
two systems: an algebraic-elliptic system for the transition and an
advection-reaction-diffusion system of Keller-Segel taxis type for the
invasion.

a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked
through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit,
derivatives, foreign exchange and securities. The interplay of the various
exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer
network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from
four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007-2013. We show that focusing
on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90%. By
assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk
profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be
used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide
expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators
systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected
systemic losses are up to a factor four higher now than before the financial
crisis of 2007-2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual
transactions can be up to a factor of thousand higher than the corresponding
credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing
non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates
the total risk. The method presented here is the first objective data driven
quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels.

Experiments using Ge and Si were performed that demonstrate that energetic
particles, the products of collisions in the electron beam, were responsible
for the majority of electron-beam deposition (EBD) induced defects in a
two-step energy transfer process. Lowering the number of collisions of these
energetic particles with the semiconductor during metal deposition was
accomplished using a combination of static shields and superior vacuum
resulting in devices with defect concentrations lower than $
10^{11}\,$cm$^{-3}$, the measurement limit of our deep level transient
spectroscopy (DLTS) system. High energy electrons and photons that samples are
typically exposed to were not influenced by the shields as most of these
particles originate at the metal target thus eliminating these particles as
possible damage causing agents. It remains unclear how packets of energy that
can sometimes be as small of 2eV travel up to a $\mu$m into the material while
still retaining enough energy, that is, in the order of 1eV, to cause changes
in the crystal. The manipulation of this defect causing phenomenon may hold the
key to developing defect free material for future applications.

contribute to most physical processes. The use of an overly complex model
results in reduced predictive power and worse resolution on unknown parameters
of interest. Therefore, it is common to reduce the complexity by removing from
consideration some subset of the allowed amplitudes. This paper studies a
method for limiting model complexity from the data sample itself through
regularization during regression in the context of a multivariate (Dalitz-plot)
analysis. The regularization technique applied greatly improves the
performance. An outline of how to obtain the significance of a resonance in a
multivariate amplitude analysis is also provided.

Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation for a particle in a frame undergoing an
uniform acceleration in an otherwise flat Minkowski space-time geometry. We
have presented an exact solution of the equation and obtained the
eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues. It has been observed that the
Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation can be reduced to an one dimensional
hydrogen atom problem. Whereas, the quantized energy levels are exactly
identical with that of an one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Hence
considering transitions, we have predicted the existence of a new kind of
quanta, which will either be emitted or absorbed if the particles get excited
or de-excited respectively.

problem for one-dimensional, compressible fluid flows represented by the
Euler-Poisson system. Exact nonlinear and time-dependent solutions are
obtained, which exhibit a variety of transient phenomena such as a density
collapse in finite space-time or the appearance and, for the first time, a
successive dissolution of wavelet structures during the same event. The latter
are superimposed on the gross density pattern in the course of the
uni-directional expansion of an initially localized density hump. Whereas
self-gravitating fluids will always experience collapse, neutral fluids and
fluids with repulsive forces, such as a non-neutral, pure electron fluid, can
exhibit an evolution of the second type, being determined by the initial
conditions. For an electron fluid, being embedded in a neutralizing ion
background, these nonlinearities are, however, strongly diminished due to the
omnipresent plasma oscillations, which weaken and alternatively change the sign
of the collective force.
