simulation starts and a numerical solution method is applied, some kind of
structural analysis is performed to determine the structure and the index of a
DAE. Structural analysis methods serve as a necessary preprocessing stage, and
among them, Pantelides's algorithm is widely used.
  Recently Pryce's $\Sigma$-method is becoming increasingly popular, owing to
its straightforward approach and capability of analyzing high-order systems.
Both methods are equivalent in the sense that when one succeeds, producing a
nonsingular system Jacobian, the other also succeeds, and the two give the same
structural index.
  Although provably successful on fairly many problems of interest, the
structural analysis methods can fail on some simple, solvable DAEs and give
incorrect structural information including the index. In this report, we focus
on the $\Sigma$-method. We investigate its failures, and develop two
symbolic-numeric conversion methods for converting a DAE, on which the
$\Sigma$-method fails, to an equivalent problem on which this method succeeds.
Aimed at making structural analysis methods more reliable, our conversion
methods exploit structural information of a DAE, and require a symbolic tool
for their implementation.

transmitter to receiver, is perhaps the most intuitive way to measure distances
using wireless signals. It is used in major positioning systems such as GPS,
RADAR, and SONAR. However, attempts at using time-of-flight for indoor
localization have failed to deliver acceptable accuracy due to fundamental
limitations in measuring time on Wi-Fi and other RF consumer technologies.
While the research community has developed alternatives for RF-based indoor
localization that do not require time-of-flight, those approaches have their
own limitations that hamper their use in practice. In particular, many existing
approaches need receivers with large antenna arrays while commercial Wi-Fi
nodes have two or three antennas. Other systems require fingerprinting the
environment to create signal maps. More fundamentally, none of these methods
support indoor positioning between a pair of Wi-Fi devices
without~third~party~support.
  In this paper, we present a set of algorithms that measure the time-of-flight

unknown and several arbitrary alternatives are employed in prominence wave
studies. We present a comparison of theoretical models for the field-aligned
density along prominence fine structures. We consider Lorentzian, Gaussian, and
parabolic profiles. We compare their theoretical predictions for the period
ratio between the fundamental transverse kink mode and the first overtone to
obtain estimates for the ratio of densities between the central part of the
tube and its foot-points and to assess which one would better explain observed
period ratio data. Bayesian parameter inference and model comparison techniques
are developed and applied. Parameter inference requires the computation of the
posterior distribution for the density gradient parameter conditional on the
observable period ratio. Model comparison involves the computation of the
marginal likelihood as a function of the period ratio to obtain the
plausibility of each density model and the computation of Bayes Factors to
quantify the relative evidence for each model, given a period ratio
observation. A Lorentzian density profile, with plasma density concentrated
around the centre of the tube seems to offer the most plausible inversion
result. A Gaussian profile would require unrealistically large values of the
density gradient parameter and a parabolic density distribution does not enable
us to obtain well constrained posterior probability distributions. However, our
model comparison results indicate that the evidence points to the Gaussian and
parabolic profiles for period ratios in between 2 and 3, while the Lorentzian
profile is preferred for larger period ratio values.

Alpha Tau first reported over 20 years ago. We analyzed precise stellar radial
velocity measurements for Alpha Tau spanning over 30 years. An examination of
the Halpha and Ca II 8662 spectral lines, and Hipparcos photometry was also
done to help discern the nature of the long-period radial velocity variations.
Our radial velocity data show that the long-period, low amplitude radial
velocity variations are long-lived and coherent. Furthermore, Halpha equivalent
width measurements and Hipparcos photometry show no significant variations with
this period. Another investigation of this star established that there was no
variability in the spectral line shapes with the radial velocity period. An
orbital solution results in a period of P = 628.96 +/- 0.90 d, eccentricity, e
= 0.10 +/- 0.05, and a radial velocity amplitude, K = 142.1 +/- 7.2 m/s.
Evolutionary tracks yield a stellar mass of 1.13 +/- 0.11 M_sun, which
corresponds to a minimum companion mass of 6.47 +/- 0.53 M_Jup with an orbital
semi-major axis of a = 1.46 +/- 0.27 AU. After removing the orbital motion of
the companion, an additional period of ~ 520 d is found in the radial velocity
data, but only in some time spans. A similar period is found in the variations
in the equivalent width of Halpha and Ca II. Variations at one-third of this
period are also found in the spectral line bisector measurements. The 520 d
period is interpreted as the rotation modulation by stellar surface structure.
Its presence, however, may not be long-lived, and it only appears in epochs of
the radial velocity data separated by $\sim$ 10 years. This might be due to an
activity cycle. The data presented here provide further evidence of a planetary
companion to Alpha Tau, as well as activity-related radial velocity variations.

proposed as a potential solution to provide proactive energy replenishment for
wireless devices. This paper aims to analyze the performance of a battery-free
wireless sensor powered by ambient RF energy harvesting using a stochastic
geometry approach. Specifically, we consider the point-to-point uplink
transmission of a wireless sensor in a stochastic geometry network, where
ambient RF sources, such as mobile transmit devices, access points and base
stations, are distributed as a Ginibre alpha-determinantal point process (DPP).
The DPP is able to capture repulsion among points, and hence, it is more
general than the Poisson point process (PPP). We analyze two common receiver
architectures: separated receiver and time-switching architectures. For each
architecture, we consider the scenarios with and without co-channel
interference for information transmission. We derive the expectation of the RF
energy harvesting rate in closed form and also compute its variance. Moreover,
we perform a worst-case study which derives the upper bound of both power and
transmission outage probabilities. Additionally, we provide guidelines on the
setting of optimal time-switching coefficient in the case of the time-switching
architecture. Numerical results verify the correctness of the analysis and show
various tradeoffs between parameter setting. Lastly, we prove that the sensor
is more efficient when the distribution of the ambient sources exhibits
stronger repulsion.

Although SMP can be solved in polynomial time, SMP-C is NP-Complete. Hence, it
is not clear which, if any, of the theoretical results surrounding the
canonical SMP problem apply in this setting. In this paper, we use a
recently-developed SAT encoding to solve SMP-C exactly. This allows us to
enumerate all stable matchings for any given instance of SMP-C. With this tool,
we empirically evaluate some of the properties that have been hypothesized to
hold for SMP-C.
  We take particular interest in investigating if, as the size of the market
grows, the percentage of instances with unique stable matchings also grows.
While we did not find this trend among the random problem instances we sampled,
we did find that the percentage of instances with an resident optimal matching
seems to more closely follow the trends predicted by previous conjectures. We
also define and investigate resident Pareto optimal stable matchings, finding
that, even though this is important desideratum for the deferred acceptance
style algorithms previously designed to solve SMP-C, they do not always find
one.
  We also investigate strategy-proofness for SMP-C, showing that even if only
one stable matching exists, residents still have incentive to misreport their

show that residents cannot manipulate via truncation.

require data to be returned within a fixed latency, and thus memory extension
methods over commodity DDRx interfaces fail to support scalable topologies.
Current extension approaches either use slow PCIe interfaces, or require
expensive changes to the memory interface, which limits commercial
adoptability. Here we propose twin-load, a lightweight asynchronous memory
access mechanism over the synchronous DDRx interface. Twin-load uses two
special loads to accomplish one access request to extended memory, the first
serves as a prefetch command to the DRAM system, and the second asynchronously
gets the required data. Twin-load requires no hardware changes on the processor
side and only slight soft- ware modifications. We emulate this system on a

comparable performance to NUMA extended memory and outperforms a page-swapping
PCIe-based system by several orders of magnitude. Twin-load thus enables
instant capacity increases on commodity platforms, but more importantly, our
architecture opens opportunities for the design of novel, efficient, scalable,

behind-the-limb solar flare, which presents a unique opportunity to probe the
underlying physics of high-energy flare emission and particle acceleration. On
2013 October 11 a GOES M1.5 class solar flare occurred ~ 9.9 degrees behind the
solar limb as observed by STEREO-B. RHESSI observed hard X-ray emission above
the limb, most likely from the flare loop-top, as the footpoints were occulted.
Surprisingly, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) detected >100 MeV gamma-rays
for ~30 minutes with energies up to GeV. The LAT emission centroid is
consistent with the RHESSI hard X-ray source, but its uncertainty does not
constrain the source to be located there. The gamma-ray spectra can be
adequately described by bremsstrahlung radiation from relativistic electrons
having a relatively hard power-law spectrum with a high-energy exponential
cutoff, or by the decay of pions produced by accelerated protons and ions with
an isotropic pitch-angle distribution and a power-law spectrum with a number
index of ~3.8. We show that high optical depths rule out the gamma rays
originating from the flare site and a high-corona trap model requires very
unusual conditions, so a scenario in which some of the particles accelerated by
the CME shock travel to the visible side of the Sun to produce the observed
gamma rays may be at work.

interest because its frustrated magnetic interactions may, in theory, lead to
highly exotic magnetic fluids. However, its true magnetic state at low

introduce high-precision, boundary-free magnetization transport techniques
based upon toroidal geometries and gain a fundamentally new understanding of
the time- and frequency-dependent magnetization dynamics of Dy2Ti2O7. We
demonstrate a virtually universal HN form for the magnetic susceptibility, a
general KWW form for the real-time magnetic relaxation, and a divergence of the
microscopic magnetic relaxation rates with precisely the VTF trajectory. Low
temperature Dy2Ti2O7 therefore exhibits the characteristics of a supercooled

invariant lattice of strongly correlated spins is evolving towards an
unprecedented magnetic glass state, perhaps due to many-body localization of

the presence of a leader is necessary. We focus on a particularly interesting
subset of dynamic networks, namely \textit{Persistent Distance} - ${\cal

model weights can provide insight into neural representations. Often, neural
input-output relationships are sparse, with only a few inputs contributing to
the output. In part to account for such sparsity, structured regularizers are
incorporated into model fitting optimization. However, by imposing priors,
structured regularizers can make it difficult to interpret learned model
parameters. Here, we investigate a simple, minimally structured model
estimation method for accurate, unbiased estimation of sparse models based on
Bootstrapped Adaptive Threshold Selection followed by ordinary least-squares
refitting (BoATS). Through extensive numerical investigations, we show that
this method often performs favorably compared to L1 and L2 regularizers. In

accurately recovers the parameters of sparse models, leading to more
parsimonious explanations of outputs. Finally, we apply this method to the task

sensitive to the variation of two cosmological parameters: the (total) matter
density parameter, $\Omega_m$, and the normalisation of the primordial power
spectrum, expressed in terms of $\sigma_8$. Both these parameters influence the
abundances of collapsed structures and their internal structure. We compute the
expected number of gravitational arcs with various length-to-width ratios in
mock light cones, by varying these cosmological parameters in the ranges
$0.1\leq\Omega_m\leq0.5$ and $0.6\leq\sigma_8\leq 1$. We find that the arc
counts dependence on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ is similar, but not identical,
to that of the halo counts. We investigate how the precision of the constraints
on the cosmological parameters based on arc counts depends on the survey area.
We find that the constraining power of arc statistics degrades critically only
for surveys covering an area smaller than $10\%$ of the whole sky. Finally, we
consider the case in which the search for arcs is done only in frames where
galaxy clusters have been previously identified. Adopting the selection
function for galaxy clusters expected to be detected from photometric data in
future wide surveys, we find that less than $10\%$ of the arcs will be missed,

disks that determines the water content of terrestrial planets in the habitable
zone. Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass
accretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in
the disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass
accretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed
dispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial
disk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line
locations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass
accretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line
locations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location
among solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more
realistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located
up to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of
N-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial
planets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion
in snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like
dust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around
sun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of
low-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The
closer-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the
habitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.
Considering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host
most of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are
able to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution.

conformal diagram for the characteristic surfaces on which isotropic

pathological frame where kinetic terms of the perturbations vanish, confusing
the Hamiltonian counting of degrees of freedom. This frame dependence
distinguishes the vanishing of kinetic terms from strong coupling of

characteristics do and do not originate from a point where perturbation theory
breaks down and where spacelike surfaces do or do not intersect all

phenomenological parameters of Luttinger liquid effective field theory, and the
microscopic interactions of the Fermi gas. In particular, we begin by
explaining how to model effective interactions in one dimension, which we then
apply to the main forward scattering channel -- the interbranch collisions --
common to these systems. We renormalise the corresponding interbranch
phenomenological constants in favour of scattering phase shifts. Interestingly,
our renormalisation procedure shows (i) how Luttinger's model arises in a
completely natural way -- and not as a convenient approximation -- from
Tomonaga's model, and (ii) the reasons behind the interbranch coupling constant
remaining unrenormalised in Luttinger's model. We then consider the so-called
intrabranch processes, whose phenomenological coupling constant is known to be
fixed by charge conservation, but whose microscopic origin is not well
understood. We show that, contrary to general belief and common sense, the
intrabranch interactions appearing in Luttinger liquid theory do not correspond
to an intrabranch scattering channel, nor an energy shift due to intrabranch
interactions, in the microscopic theory. Instead, they are due to interbranch
processes. We finally apply our results to a particular example of an exactly

120 deep ALMA pointing data that include all the archival deep data available
by 2015 June. We derive number counts of 1.2 mm continuum sources down to 0.02
mJy partly with the assistance of gravitational lensing, and find that the
total integrated 1.2 mm flux of the securely identified sources is
22.9^(+6.7)_(-5.6) Jy deg^(-2) that corresponds to 104^(+31)_(-25) % of the
extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by COBE observations. These
results suggest that the major 1.2 mm EBL contributors are sources with 0.02
mJy, and that very faint 1.2 mm sources with ~< 0.02 mJy contribute negligibly
to the EBL with the possible flattening and/or truncation of number counts in
this very faint flux regime. To understand the physical origin of our faint
ALMA sources, we measure the galaxy bias bg by the counts-in-cells technique,
and place a stringent upper limit of bg < 3.5 that is not similar to bg values
of massive DRGs and SMGs but comparable to those of UV-bright sBzKs and LBGs.
Moreover, in optical and near-infrared (NIR) deep fields, we identify
optical-NIR counterparts for 59% of our faint ALMA sources, majority of which
have luminosities, colors, and the IRX-beta relation same as sBzKs and LBGs. We
thus conclude that about a half of our faint ALMA sources are dust-poor high-z
galaxies as known as sBzKs and LBGs in optical studies, and that these faint
ALMA sources are not miniature (U)LIRGs simply scaled down with the infrared
brightness.

to host the smallest separation dual AGN resolved in the X-rays. While past
results suggested a 150 pc separation dual AGN, three times deeper Chandra

heavily obscured, radio-bright AGN. Using VLA and VLBA data, we find an AGN
with a two-sided jet rather than a dual AGN and that the hard X-ray, UV,
optical, NIR, and radio emission are all from a single point source with a
radius <0.2"". We find that the previously reported dual AGN is most likely a
spurious detection resulting from the low number of X-ray counts (<160) at 6-7
keV and Gaussian smoothing of the data on scales much smaller than the PSF
(0.25"" vs. 0.80"" FWHM). We show that statistical noise in a single Chandra PSF
generates spurious dual peaks of the same separation (0.55$\pm$0.07"" vs. 0.6"")
and flux ratio (39$\pm$9% vs. 32% of counts) as the purported dual AGN. With
NuSTAR, we measure a Compton-thick source (NH=$2.2\pm0.4\times10^{24}$

postulate results from feedback from strong radio jets. This AGN shows a 2-10

to cases with non-zero NSNS flux (respecting the isometries) provided that the
flux satisfies a condition of the form H_{abc}H^{cde}~R_{ab}^{de}. We then turn
our attention to the type II Green-Schwarz superstring on a symmetric space. We

the integrability extends to the full string by augmenting the supercoset Lax

In particular we focus on how we can attempt to balance the available accretion
energy with feedback to the environment via radiation, jets and winds,
considering also possible contributions to the energy balance from black hole
spin and advection. We review quantitatively the methods which are used to
estimate these quantities, regardless of the details of the astrophysics close
to the black hole. Once these methods have been outlined, we work through an
outburst of a black hole X-ray binary system, estimating the flow of mass and
energy through the different accretion rates and states. While we focus on
feedback from stellar mass black holes in X-ray binary systems, we also
consider the applicability of what we have learned to supermassive black holes
in active galactic nuclei. As an important control sample we also review the
coupling between accretion and feedback in neutron stars, and show that it is
very similar to that observed in black holes, which strongly constrains how
much of the astrophysics of feedback can be unique to black holes.

results in a sample of galaxies that are massive systems that span a range of
metallicities in comparison with previous optically selected surveys, and thus
has a higher AGN fraction and better samples the AGN branch. We establish the
presence of AGN and starbursts in this sample of (U)LIRGs selected as
Herschel-PACS and Spitzer-MIPS detections in two redshift bins (z~0.7 and
z~1.5) and test the redshift dependence of diagnostics used to separate AGN
from star-formation dominated galaxies. In addition, we construct a low

the evolution from z~1.5 to today is consistent with an evolving AGN selection
line and a range of ISM conditions and metallicities from the models of Kewley

find that the new classification line accurately selects most of these objects

connect the inferred density field to the properties of dark matter halos. To
demonstrate the capability of our approach we construct a realistic galaxy mock
catalogue emulating the wide-area 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey, which has a
median redshift of approximately 0.05. Application of HADES to the catalogue
provides us with accurately inferred three-dimensional density fields and
corresponding quantification of uncertainties inherent to any cosmological
observation. We then use a cosmological simulation to relate the amplitude of
the density field to the probability of detecting a halo with mass above a
specified threshold. With this information we can sum over the HADES density
field realisations to construct maps of detection probabilities and demonstrate
the validity of this approach within our mock scenario. We find that the
probability of successful of detection of halos in the mock catalogue increases
as a function of the signal-to-noise of the local galaxy observations. Our
proposed methodology can easily be extended to account for more complex
scientific questions and is a promising novel tool to analyse the cosmic
large-scale structure in observations.

as well as the old stellar population and radio-bright AGN outflows. Nearly
half of the sample possesses kpc-scale filaments that, in projection, extend
toward and around radio lobes and/or X-ray cavities. These filaments may have
been uplifted by the propagating jet or buoyant X-ray bubble, or may have
formed {\it in situ} by cloud collapse at the interface of a radio lobe or
rapid cooling in a cavity's compressed shell. The morphological diversity of

forming clouds that precipitate from the hot atmosphere. In this model,
precipitation triggers where the cooling-to- freefall time ratio is

hallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless
surface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave
functions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of
topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. We
consider both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their
classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time-reversal, as
well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection. Furthermore, we survey the
classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects. The
classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups,
Clifford algebras, K-theory, and non-linear sigma models describing the
Anderson (de-)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material.
Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed
together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and
comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is
concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field
Hamiltonians, we also provide a brief overview of recent results and open
questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems.

problem approximately by a local algorithm of generalized leaf removal and by a
message-passing algorithm of belief propagation. These algorithms can construct
near-optimal dominating sets or even exact minimum dominating sets for random
digraphs and also for real-world digraph instances. We further develop a core

stellar generations in And~XXI: 1) an old ($\sim$ 12 Gyr) and metal poor

younger (10-6 Gyr) and more metal rich ([Fe/H]=$-$1.5 dex) component populating
the red horizontal branch, and 3) a young age ($\sim$ 1 Gyr) component with
same metallicity, that produced the ACs. Finally, we provide hints that And~XXI

are often studied under the assumption that the evolution of the new (often
scalar) degree of freedom present in the theory is quasi-static. This
approximation significantly simplifies the study of the theory, and one often
has good reason to believe that it should hold. Nevertheless it is a crucial
assumption that should be explicitly checked whenever possible. In this paper
we do so for the Vainshtein mechanism. By solving for the full spatial and time
evolution of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati and the Cubic Galileon model, in a
spherical symmetric spacetime, we are able to demonstrate that the Vainshtein
solution is a stable attractor and forms no matter what initial conditions we
take for the scalar field. Furthermore,the quasi-static approximation is also
found to be a very good approximation whenever it exists. For the best-fit
Cubic Galileon model, however, we find that for deep voids at late times, the
numerical solution blows up at the same time as the quasi-static solution
ceases to exist. We argue that this phenomenon is a true instability of the

global contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from most

speed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us to
tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, we
explore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as
an additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported on

unusual is that they come in multiplets of a new ""dark"" non-Abelian gauge group
with milli-weak coupling. The massless dark gluons of this dark gauge group
contribute to the energy density of the universe as a form of weakly

iii.) dark matter which is weakly coupled to dark radiation. We find that i.)
dark matter cross sections are modified by multiplicity factors which have
significant consequences for collider searches and indirect detection, ii.)
dark gluons have thermal abundances which affect the CMB as dark radiation.
Unlike additional massless neutrino species the dark gluons are interacting and

radial growth rates of the stellar discs of spiral galaxies, based on their
star formation rate surface density (SFRD) profiles. Under the hypothesis that
discs are exponential with time-varying scalelengths, we derive a universal
theoretical profile for the SFRD, with a linear dependence on two parameters:
the specific mass growth rate $\nu_\textrm{M} \equiv \dot{M_\star}/M_\star$ and
the specific radial growth rate $\nu_\textrm{R} \equiv \dot{R}_\star/R_\star$
of the disc. We test our theory on a sample of 35 nearby spiral galaxies, for
which we derive a measurement of $\nu_\textrm{M}$ and $\nu_\textrm{R}$. 32/35
galaxies show the signature of ongoing inside-out growth ($\nu_\textrm{R} >
0$). The typical derived e-folding timescales for mass and radial growth in our
sample are ~ 10 Gyr and ~ 30 Gyr, respectively, with some systematic
uncertainties. More massive discs have a larger scatter in $\nu_\textrm{M}$ and
$\nu_\textrm{R}$, biased towards a slower growth, both in mass and size. We
find a linear relation between the two growth rates, indicating that our galaxy
discs grow in size at ~ 0.35 times the rate at which they grow in mass; this
ratio is largely unaffected by systematics. Our results are in very good
agreement with theoretical expectations if known scaling relations of disc
galaxies are not evolving with time.

terrestrial planets along with the formation of steam atmospheres. The lifetime
of a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the
orbital distance of the planet from the host star. For a type-I planet, which
is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal
emission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.
Therefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in
this orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the
critical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared
atmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L
bands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star
contrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$. Our
model predicts that, in the type-II orbital region, molten planets would be
present over the main sequence of the G-type host star if the initial bulk
content of water exceeds approximately 1 wt%. In visible atmospheric windows,
the contrasts of the thermal emission drop below $10^{-10}$ in less than $10^5$
years, whereas those of the reflected light remain $10^{-10}$ for both types of
planets. Since the contrast level is comparable to those of reflected light
from Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, the visible reflected light
from molten planets also provides a promising target for direct imaging with
future ground- and space-based telescopes.

agreements between service and content providers, i.e. to allow some
preferential treatment by an operator to traffic from some subset of providers.
Our goal in this paper is to analyze the impact of non neutral pricing and
agreements on the Internet users and on the content providers. Each one of
several Internet users have to decide in which way to split their demand among
several content providers. The cost for an Internet user depends on whether the
content providers have an agreement with the Internet Service Provider in which
the Internet user is connected to. In addition, the requests coming from users
depend on the preference of the consumer in the different CP. We model the
choice of how to split the demands and the pricing aspects faced by the content
providers as a hierarchical game model composed of a congestion game at the
lower level and a noncooperative pricing game at the upper level. We show that
agreement between providers have a positive impact on the equilibrium
performance of the Internet users. We further show that at equilibrium, the
content provider on the contrary, does not benefit from the agreement.

patterns known as resting state networks (RSNs). It is well known that
techniques like independent component analysis can separate the brain activity
at rest to provide such RSNs, but the specific pattern of interaction between
RSNs is not yet fully understood. To this aim, we propose here a novel method
to compute the information flow (IF) between different RSNs from resting state
magnetic resonance imaging. After haemodynamic response function blind
deconvolution of all voxel signals, and under the hypothesis that RSNs define
regions of interest, our method first uses principal component analysis to
reduce dimensionality in each RSN to next compute IF (estimated here in terms
of Transfer Entropy) between the different RSNs by systematically increasing k
(the number of principal components used in the calculation). When k = 1, this
method is equivalent to computing IF using the average of all voxel activities
in each RSN. For k greater than one our method calculates the k-multivariate IF
between the different RSNs. We find that the average IF among RSNs is
dimension-dependent, increasing from k =1 (i.e., the average voxels activity)
up to a maximum occurring at k =5 to finally decay to zero for k greater than
10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to 5) is sufficient
to describe the IF pattern between RSNs. Our method - addressing differences in
IF between RSNs for any generic data - can be used for group comparison in
health or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the interRSNs IF in a
dataset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to find that the most significant
differences between AD and controls occurred for k =2, in addition to AD
showing increased IF w.r.t. controls.

power-law decay with a temporal index of 0.5 before returning to the persistent

spectra of the persistent X-ray emission of the source. By comparing the
persistent spectrum with that previously reported, we find that the source
hard-band emission has been stable over approximately 10 years. The persistent
hard X-ray emission is well fitted by a coronal outflow model, where $e^{+/-}$
pairs in the magnetosphere upscatter thermal X-rays. Our fit of phase-resolved

Mininet emulator or distributed physical testbeds. We refer to this suite of

graphical topology designer, which provides different layered network ""views""

validate an input topology, automatically deploy it over a Mininet emulator or
a distributed SDN testbed and allows access to emulated nodes by opening
consoles in the web GUI. Mantoo provides also tools to evaluate the performance

Liquid Xe, specifically, tracking capability and better energy resolution for

recombination changes the scintillation and ionization yields depending on the
angle between a track and the electric field direction. In order to realize

results show that the directionality signal can be obtained for a track longer
than a few micrometers in some ideal cases. Although more studies with
realistic assumptions are still needed in order to assess feasibility of this
technique, this potentially opens a new possibility for dark matter searches.

superconductor with nonlinear corrections to the U(1) gauge field. We start
with an asymptotic Anti-de-Sitter(AdS) black hole against a complex scalar
perturbation at the initial time, and solve the dynamics of the gravitational
systems in the bulk. When the black hole temperature T is smaller than a
critical value Tc, the scalar perturbation grows exponentially till saturation,
the final state of spacetime approaches to a hairy black hole. In the bulk
theory, we find the clue of the influence of nonlinear corrections in the gauge
field on the process of the scalar field condensation. We show that the bulk
dynamics in the non-equilibrium process is completely consistent with the
observations on the boundary order parameter. Furthermore we examine the time
evolution of horizons in the bulk non-equilibrium transformation process from
the bald AdS black hole to the AdS hairy hole. Both the evolution of apparent
and event horizons show that the original AdS black hole configuration requires
more time to finish the transformation to become a hairy black hole if there is
nonlinear correction to the electromagnetic field. We generalize our
non-equilibrium discussions to the holographic entanglement entropy and find
that the holographic entanglement entropy can give us further understanding of
the influence of the nonlinearity in the gauge field on the scalar
condensation. In our analysis, we also compare the effect of different models

shown that, beyond the main effects of genetic (G) and environmental (E) risk
factors, the gene-environment (G$\times$E) interactions also play a critical
role. In practice, the prognosis outcome data can be contaminated, and most of
the existing methods are not robust to data contamination. In the literature,
it has been shown that even a single contaminated observation can lead to
severely biased model estimation. In this study, we describe prognosis using an
accelerated failure time (AFT) model. An exponential squared loss is proposed
to accommodate possible data contamination. A penalization approach is adopted
for regularized estimation and marker selection. The proposed method is
realized using an effective coordinate descent (CD) and minorization
maximization (MM) algorithm. Simulation shows that without contamination, the
proposed method has performance comparable to or better than the unrobust
alternative. With contamination, it outperforms the unrobust alternative and,
under certain scenarios, can be superior to the robust method based on quantile
regression. The proposed method is applied to the analysis of TCGA (The Cancer
Genome Atlas) lung cancer data. It identifies interactions different from those
using the alternatives. The identified marker have important implications and
satisfactory stability.

of MoS2 crystal are found to follow a Drude model in THz region, which is due
to the intrinsic carrier absorption. In visible region, the general trend of

matter has often initially confounded, but ultimately enhanced, our basic
understanding of the coexisting types of order. The associated intellectual
challenges, together with the promise of greater versatility for potential
applications, have made such systems a focus of modern materials science. In
particular, great efforts have recently been devoted to making semiconductors
ferromagnetic and metallic ferromagnets superconducting. Here we report the
unprecedented observation of a heavily donor-doped ferromagnetic semiconductor,
SmN, becoming superconducting with ferromagnetism remaining intact. The
extremely large exchange splitting of the conduction and valence bands in this
material necessitates that the superconducting order hosted by SmN is of an
unconventional triplet type, most likely exhibiting p-wave symmetry. Short
range spin fluctuations, which are thought to be the cause of pairing
interactions in currently known triplet superconductors, are quenched in SmN,
suggesting its superconductivity to be the result of phonon- or
Coulomb-mediated pairing mechanisms. This scenario is further supported by the
inferred heavy mass of superconducting charge carriers. The unique near-zero
magnetisation associated with the ferromagnetic state in SmN further aids its
coexistence with superconductivity. Presenting this novel material system where
semiconducting, ferromagnetic and superconducting properties are combined
provides a versatile new laboratory for studying quantum phases of matter.
Moreover it is a major step towards identifying materials that merge
superconductivity and spintronics, urgently needed to enable the design of
electronic devices with superior functionality.

  experiment","Accepted to A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201424810",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the atomic neutral hydrogen (HI) content of $\sim$1600 galaxies up
to $z \sim 0.1$ using stacking techniques. The observations were carried out
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the area of the SDSS
South Galactic Cap (SSGC), where we selected a galaxy sample from the SDSS
spectroscopic catalog. Multi-wavelength information is provided by SDSS, NVSS,
GALEX, and WISE. We use the collected information to study HI trends with
color, star-forming, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) properties.
  Using NUV-r colors, galaxies are divided into blue cloud, green valley and
red sequence galaxies. As expected based on previous observations, we detect HI
in green valley objects with lower amounts of HI than blue galaxies, while
stacking only produces a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit for red galaxies with M$_{\rm
HI}$ $<$ (5 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ and M$_{\rm HI}/\rm{L}_r$
$<$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.006 $\rm M_{\odot} / \rm L_{\odot} $. We find that the HI
content is more dependent on NUV-r color, and less on ionization properties, in
the sense that regardless of the presence of an optical AGN (based on optical
ionization line diagnostics), green-valley galaxies always show HI, whereas red
galaxies only produce an upper limit. This suggests that feedback from optical
AGN is not the (main) reason for depleting large-scale gas reservoirs.
  Low-level radio continuum emission in our galaxies can stem either from star
formation, or from AGN. We use the WISE color-color plot to separate these
phenomena by dividing the sample into IR late-type and IR early-type galaxies.
We find that the radio emission in IR late-type galaxies stems from enhanced
star formation, and this group is detected in HI. However, IR early-type
galaxies lack any sign of HI gas and star formation activity, suggesting that
radio AGN are likely to be the source of radio emission in this population.

stars. Their population is compared with that of hydrogen-deficient LMXBs,
known as ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). We model the observable LMXB
population and compare it to observations. Methods. We combine the binary
population synthesis code SeBa with detailed LMXB evolutionary tracks to model
the size and properties of the present-day LMXB population in the Galactic
Bulge. Whether sources are persistent or transient, and what their
instantaneous X-ray luminosities are, is predicted using the thermal-viscous
disk instability model. Results. We find a population of ~2.1 x 10^3 LMXBs with
neutron star accretors. Of these about 15 - 40 are expected to be persistent
(depending on model assumptions), with luminosities higher than 10^35 erg s^-1.
About 7 - 20 transient sources are expected to be in outburst at any given
time. Within a factor of two these numbers are consistent with the observed
population of bright LMXBs in the Bulge. This gives credence to our prediction
of the existence of a population of ~1.6 x 10^3 LMXBs with low donor masses
that have gone through the period minimum, and have present-day mass transfer
rates below 10^-11 Msun yr^-1. Conclusions. Even though the observed population
of hydrogen-rich LMXBs in the Bulge is larger than the observed population of
(hydrogen-deficient) UCXBs, the latter have a higher formation rate. While
UCXBs may dominate the total LMXB population at the present, the majority would
be very faint, or may have become detached and produced millisecond radio
pulsars. In that case UCXBs would contribute significantly more to the
formation of millisecond radio pulsars than hydrogen-rich LMXBs. [abridged]

to known resonance states in the context of quantum chromodyanmics and

manifestly predict the maximized cross section at the MeV scale, however, any

hitherto. Hence, we propose the direct measurement with the maximized
cross-section at the center-of-mass system energy of 1-2 MeV to establish the
firm footing at the MeV scale. Given currently state-of-the-art high power
lasers, the helicity dependent elastic scattering may be observed at a
reasonable rate, if a photon-photon collider exploiting $\gamma$-rays generated
by the inverse nonlinear Compton process with electrons delivered from

compounds, except Ti$_2$CoSi possess a ferrimagnetic ground state. Due to the
finite energy gap in one spin channel, the exchange interactions decay sharply
with the distance, and hence magnetism of these SGSs can be described
considering only nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions. The
calculated spin-wave dispersion curves are typical for ferrimagnets and
ferromagnets. The spin-wave stiffness constants turn out to be larger than
those of the elementary 3$d$-ferromagnets. Calculated exchange parameters are
used as input to determine the temperature dependence of the magnetization and
$T_\mathrm{c}$ of the SGSs. We find that the $T_\mathrm{c}$ of all compounds is

nucleosynthesis, structure and evolution of galaxies and accretion processes.
Hard X-rays observations by INTEGRAL and Swift have broad- ened significantly
our understanding in particular for the super-giant systems in the Milky Way,
which number has increased by almost a factor of three. INTEGRAL played a
crucial role in the discovery, study and understanding of heavily obscured
systems and of fast X-ray transients. Most super-giant systems can now be
classified in three categories: classical/obscured, eccentric and fast
transient. The classical systems feature low eccentricity and variability
factor of about 1000, mostly driven by hydrodynamic phenomena occurring on
scales larger than the accretion radius. Among them, systems with short orbital
periods and close to Roche-Lobe overflow or with slow winds, appear highly
obscured. In eccentric systems, the variability amplitude can reach even higher
factors, because of the contrast of the wind density along the orbit. Four
super-giant systems, featuring fast outbursts, very short orbital periods and
anomalously low accretion rates, are not yet understood. Simulations of the
accretion processes on relatively large scales have pro- gressed and reproduce
parts of the observations. The combined effects of wind clumps, magnetic
fields, neutron star rotation and eccentricity ought to be included in future
modelling work. Observations with INTEGRAL in combination with other
observatories were also important for detecting cyclotron resonant scattering
features in spectra of X-ray pulsars, probing their variations and the geometry
of the accretion column and emission regions. Finally, the unique
characteristics of INTEGRAL and its long life time played a fundamental role
for building a complete catalogue of HXMBs, to study the different populations
of these systems ...

neural network with unbounded activation functions still satisfies the
universal approximation property. As an additional consequence, the ridgelet
transform, or the backprojection filter in the Radon domain, is what the
network learns after backpropagation. Subject to a constructive admissibility
condition, the trained network can be obtained by simply discretizing the
ridgelet transform, without backpropagation. Numerical examples not only
support the consistency of the admissibility condition but also imply that some
non-admissible cases result in low-pass filtering.

power spectrum, the effective power spectrum deviates more significantly from

indicate that traditional analyses based on the dark matter density field may

making use of the differences between the conventional and effective dark

extent, evolution and energetics, of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The
SZ-galaxy cross-power spectrum, especially at large multipoles, depends on the
steepness of the pressure profile of the CGM. This property of the SZ signal
can, thus, be used to constrain the pressure profile of the CGM. The X-ray
cross power spectrum also has a similar shape. However, it is much more
sensitive to the underlying density profile. We forecast the detectability of
the cross-correlated galaxy distribution, SZ and X-ray signals by combining
South Pole Telescope-Dark Energy Survey (SPT-DES) and eROSITA-DES/eROSITA-LSST
(extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array-Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope) surveys, respectively. We find that, for the SPT-DES survey, the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) peaks at high mass and redshift with SNR $\sim 9$
around $M_h\sim 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and $z\sim 1.5\hbox{--} 2$ for flat

eROSITA-DES (eROSITA-LSST) surveys. We also perform a Fisher matrix analysis to
find the constraint on the gas fraction in the CGM in the presence or absence
of an unknown redshift evolution of the gas fraction. Finally, we demonstrate
that the cross-correlated SZ-galaxy and X-ray-galaxy power spectrum can be used
as powerful probes of the CGM energetics and potentially discriminate between
different feedback models recently proposed in the literature; for example, one
can distinguish a `no active galactic nuclei feedback' scenario from a CGM

the correlations among $\Gamma_0$, the isotropic peak luminosity ($L_{\rm

cosmological rest frame. An analysis of pair correlations among these
observables well confirms the results reported by the previous papers. More
interestingly, a tight correlation among $L_{\rm iso}$, $E_{\rm p,z}$, and
$\Gamma_0$ is found from a multiple regression analysis, which takes the form
of $L_{\rm iso} \propto E_{\rm p,z}^{1.34\pm 0.14} \Gamma_0^{1.32\pm 0.19}$ or
$E_{\rm p,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{0.55\pm 0.06}\Gamma_0^{-0.50\pm 0.17}$. Nine
other GRBs whose $\Gamma_0$ are derived via the pair production opacity
constraint also follow such a correlation. Excluding GRB 060218, the $L_{\rm

co-moving frame. However, GRB 060218 deviates the $L^{'}_{\rm iso}-E^{'}_{\rm

argue that the $L_{\rm iso} - E_{\rm p, z} - \Gamma_0$ correlation may be more
physical than the $L_{\rm iso} - E_{\rm p,z}$ correlation, since physically the
relationship between the observed $L_{\rm iso}$ and $E_{\rm p,z}$ not only

  Conference 2015",,,,"cs.AI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2008, the CEO of the company that manages and maintains the public bicycle
service in Barcelona recognized that one may not expect to always find a place
to leave the rented bike nearby their destination, similarly to the case when,
driving a car, people may not find a parking lot. In this work, we make
predictions about the statuses of the stations of the public bicycle service in
Barcelona. We show that it is feasible to correctly predict nearly half of the
times when the stations are either completely full of bikes or completely
empty, up to 2 days before they actually happen. That is, users might avoid
stations at times when they could not return a bicycle that they have rented
before, or when they would not find a bike to rent. To achieve that, we apply
the Random Forest algorithm to classify the status of the stations and improve
the lifetime of the models using publicly available data, such as information
about the weather forecast. Finally, we expect that the results of the
predictions can be used to improve the quality of the service and make it more
reliable for the users.

the curve which are small with respect to the canonical height. Ullmo has
established this conjecture over number fields, and Moriwaki generalized it to
the assertion over finitely generated fields over $\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to
arithmetic heights. As for the case of function fields with respect to the
geometric heights, Cinkir has proved the conjecture over function fields of
characteristic $0$ and of transcendence degree $1$. However, the conjecture has
been open over other function fields.
  In this paper, we prove that the Bogomolov conjecture for curves holds over
any function field. In fact, we show that any non-special closed subvariety of
dimension $1$ in an abelian variety over function fields has only a finite
number of small points. This result is a consequence of the investigation of
non-density of small points of closed subvarieties of abelian varieties of
codimension $1$. As a by-product, we remark that the geometric Bogomolov
conjecture, which is a generalization of the Bogomolov conjecture for curves
over function fields, holds for any abelian variety of dimension at most $3$.
Combining this result with our previous works, we see that the geometric
Bogomolov conjecture holds for all abelian varieties for which the difference
between its nowhere degeneracy rank and the dimension of its trace is not
greater than $3$.

variability of X-ray emission from disk, may affect the energy injection into
the jet. In this spirit, a correlation between disk emission and jet emission
can be formed even if the mean luminosity of disk emission keeps constant. In
this work, these correlations are found in the situation that the luminosity of
disk emission is variable and kept with a constant mean value. The obtained
correlations may be shallower than that of the fundamental plane of black hole
activity. In addition, the slope of correlation may increase with increasing
observed frequency of jet emission. For the luminosities spacing with three
days, the slope of correlation decreases with increasing black hole mass. The
deviation of our found correlations from that of the fundamental plane is
related to the suppression of variability in the jet emission in comparison
with that in the disk emission. This mechanism may work in some sources in
which shallower correlations have been reported. Moreover, it implies that
luminosities used to estimate the relation of fundamental plane should cover an
appropriate timescale, in which the variability of jet emission is not
significantly suppressed.

four asymptotic regimes that depend on the Bond number and the size of the

where gravity dominates the probability of configurations of grains allowing
solutions close to the horizontal solution is close to one. Moreover, in such
regimes where the size of the container is sufficiently large we can describe
deviations from the horizontal in probabilistic terms.
  On the other hand, when capillarity dominates while the size of the container
is sufficiently large, we find that the probability of finding interfaces close
to the graph of a given smooth curve without self-intersections is close to

interference suppression. Specifically, let $K$ and $B$ denote the number of
users per cell and the number of orthogonal pilot sequences in the network,
respectively, where $\beta = B/K$ is the pilot reuse factor. Then our
multi-cell MMSE scheme utilizes all $B$ channel directions, that can be
estimated locally at each base station, to actively suppress both intra-cell
and inter-cell interference. The proposed scheme is particularly practical and
general, since power control for the pilot and payload, imperfect channel
estimation and arbitrary pilot allocation are all accounted for. Simulations
show that significant spectral efficiency (SE) gains are obtained over the
single-cell MMSE scheme and the multi-cell ZF, particularly for large $\beta$
and/or $K$. Furthermore, large-scale approximations of the uplink and downlink
SINRs are derived, which are asymptotically tight in the large-system limit.
The approximations are easy to compute and very accurate even for small system
dimensions. Using these SINR approximations, a low-complexity power control
algorithm is also proposed to maximize the sum SE.

necessarily an isometry of the space composed with an homothety.
  Perfect Delaunay polytopes are remarkable structure that exist only if $n=1$
or $n\geq 6$ and they have shown up recently in covering maxima studies. Here
we give a general algorithm for their enumeration that relies on the Erdahl
cone. We apply this algorithm in dimension 7 which allow us to find that there
are only two perfect Delaunay polytopes: $3_{21}$ which is a Delaunay polytope
in the root lattice $\mathsf{E}_7$ and the Erdahl Rybnikov polytope.
  We then use this classification in order to get the list of all types
Delaunay simplices in dimension 7 and found 11 types.

radio and Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) systems. This paper is devoted to
the analytical evaluation of the performance of an energy detector over Weibull
fading channels. This is a flexible fading model that has been shown capable of
providing accurate characterization of multipath fading in, e.g., typical
cellular radio frequency range of 800${/}$900 MHz. A novel analytic expression
for the corresponding average probability of detection is derived in a simple
algebraic representation which renders it convenient to handle both
analytically and numerically. As expected, the performance of the detector is
highly dependent upon the severity of fading as even small variation of the
fading parameters affect significantly the value of the average probability of
detection. This appears to be particularly the case in severe fading
conditions. The offered results are useful in evaluating the effect of
multipath fading in energy detection-based cognitive radio communication
systems and therefore they can be used in quantifying the associated trade-offs
between sensing performance and energy efficiency in cognitive radio networks.

this model treats the interaction of stereocilia both with the surrounding
liquid and with the liquid in the narrow gaps between the individual
stereocilia. The investigation revealed that grouping stereocilia in a bundle
dramatically reduces the total drag. During hair-bundle deflections, the tip
links potentially induce drag by causing small but very dissipative relative
motions between stereocilia; this effect is offset by the horizontal top
connectors that restrain such relative movements at low frequencies. For higher
frequencies the coupling liquid is sufficient to assure that the hair bundle
moves as a unit with a low total drag. This work reveals the mechanical
characteristics originating from hair-bundle morphology and shows
quantitatively how a hair bundle is adapted for sensitive mechanotransduction.

for a certain time period (measurement time), and during this interaction,
information about an observable is transferred from the system to the
apparatus. In this study, we quantify the energy fluctuation of the quantum
apparatus required for this physical process to occur autonomously. We first
examine the so-called standard model of measurement, which is free from any
non-trivial energy-time uncertainty relation, to find that it needs an external
system that switches on the interaction between the system and the apparatus.
In such a sense this model is not closed. Therefore to treat a measurement
process in a fully quantum manner we need to consider a ""larger"" quantum
apparatus which works also as a timing device switching on the interaction. In
this setting we prove that a trade-off relation (energy-time uncertainty
relation), $\tau\cdot \Delta H_A \geq \frac{\pi \hbar}{4}$, holds between the
energy fluctuation $\Delta H_A$ of the quantum apparatus and the measurement
time $\tau$. We use this trade-off relation to discuss the spacetime
uncertainty relation concerning the operational meaning of the microscopic

quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric
downconversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons
being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the
interferometer. Here we report the first Scattershot Boson Sampling
experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated
photonic circuits. We employ recently proposed statistical tools to analyse our
experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum
simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward
a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.

In the small, existence and uniqueness is well-known. Now suppose $\Delta$
carries a flat Riemannian metric $g^e$ induced by edge lengths $d(p_i,p_j)$,
where $d$ is the geodesic distance in $M$. If all edge lengths are small than
$h$ and $vol(\Delta,g^e) \geq \alpha h^n$ for some $\alpha > 0$, then we can
show that \begin{equation}
  |(x^*g - g^e)(v,w)| \leq c h^2 |v| |w|, \qquad

systems, where at least two rival states are present. In strongly correlated

between short- and long-range interactions, e.g., between exchange and
dipole-dipole interactions in the case of ferromagnetic thin films. Here we
show that spin-stripe textures may develop also in antiferromagnets, where
long-range dipole-dipole magnetic interactions are absent. A comprehensive
analysis of magnetic susceptibility, high-field magnetization, specific heat,
and neutron diffraction measurements unveils $\beta$-TeVO$_4$ as a nearly
perfect realization of a frustrated (zigzag) ferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain.
Strikingly, a narrow spin stripe phase develops at elevated magnetic fields due
to weak frustrated short-range interchain exchange interactions possibly
assisted by the symmetry allowed electric polarization. This concept provides
an alternative route for the stripe formation in strongly correlated electron
systems and may help understanding other widespread, yet still elusive,

apparent path of the Sun across the sky, whether it be its diurnal motion or

wires (representing the three solar arcs during solstices and equinoxes) will
do the job. On the other hand, since very early times, there have been famous
armillary spheres built and employed by the most outstanding astronomers for
the description of the celestial movements. In those instruments, many of them

the observer looks at the whole ""from the outside."" Of course, both devices,
the scale model of the sky and the armillary sphere, serve to represent the
movement of the Sun, and in this paper we propose to show their equivalence by
a simple construction. Knowing the basics underlying the operation of the
armillary sphere will give us confidence to use it as a teaching resource in

of the accelerated electron spectrum in solar flares from observations of the

finite volume of hot plasma in the source, need to be taken into account in
order to correctly obtain the injected electron spectrum from the
source-integrated electron flux spectrum (a quantity straightforwardly obtained
from hard X-ray observations). We show that the effect of electron
thermalization can be significant enough to nullify the need to introduce an
{\it ad hoc} low-energy cutoff to the injected electron spectrum in order to
keep the injected power in non-thermal electrons at a reasonable value. Rather
the suppression of the inferred low-energy end of the injected spectrum
compared to that deduced from a cold-target analysis allows the inference from
hard X-ray observations of a more realistic energy in injected non-thermal
electrons in solar flares.

initial conditions are essential for the survival of the colony. (b) Low adult
honeybee to brood ratios have destabilizing effects on the system, generate
fluctuated dynamics, and potentially lead to a \emph{catastrophic event} where
both honeybees and mites suddenly become extinct. This catastrophic event could
be potentially linked to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) of honeybee colonies.
(c) Virus infections may have stabilizing effects on the system, and could make
disease more persistent in the presence of parasitic mites. Our model
illustrates how the synergy between the parasitic mites and virus infections
consequently generates rich dynamics including multiple attractors where all
species can coexist or go extinct depending on initial conditions. Our findings

density of three-body resonances makes the region between the Cybele and Hilda

the last outpost of an extended main belt. The presence of binary asteroids
with large primaries and small secondaries suggested that asteroid families
should be found in this region, but only relatively recently the first
dynamical groups were identified in this area. Among these, the Sylvia group
has been proposed to be one of the oldest families in the extended main belt.
  In this work we identify families in the Cybele region in the context of the
local dynamics and non-gravitational forces such as the Yarkovsky and
stochastic YORP effects. We confirm the detection of the new Helga group at
$\simeq$3.65~AU, that could extend the outer boundary of the Cybele region up
to the 5J:-3A mean-motion resonance. We obtain age estimates for the four
families, Sylvia, Huberta, Ulla and Helga, currently detectable in the Cybele
region, using Monte Carlo methods that include the effects of stochastic YORP
and variability of the Solar luminosity. The Sylvia family should be $T = 1220

by the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN
explosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous
blue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been
observed before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as
SN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still
unclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the
existence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with
superwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN
progenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on
the nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,
in particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain
metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,
SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained
at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values
from the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity
distributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other
core-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between
metallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs
tend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.
Among SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to
those of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower
metallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe
IIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs
(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe
IIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized
Cumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II
regions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities
at higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during
SN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM
quiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in
metallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the
progenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly
arising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds
likely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,
metallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these
transients. Key words. supernovae: general - stars: evolution - galaxies:

The main tool is a new $L^1$ equivalent of the Stein martingale inequality
which holds for a special filtration of periodic subsets of $\mathbb{T}$ with
some restrictions on the functions involved. We also identify the isomorphic
type of the range of the associated operator as the independent sum of dyadic

  Quanshui Zheng","Accurate Measurement of the Cleavage Energy of Graphite",,,"10.1038/ncomms8853",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The basal plane cleavage energy (CE) of graphite is a key material parameter
for understanding many of the unusual properties of graphite, graphene, and
carbon nanotubes. The CE is equal to twice the surface energy and is closely
related to the interlayer binding energy and exfoliation energy of graphite.
Nonetheless, a wide range of values for these properties have been reported and
no consensus has yet emerged as to their magnitude. Here, we report the first
direct, accurate experimental measurement of the CE of graphite using a novel
method based on the recently discovered self-retraction phenomenon in graphite.
The measured value, 0.37 +/- 0.01 J/m2 for the incommensurate state of
bicrystal graphite, is nearly invariant with respect to temperature (from
22{\deg}C to 198{\deg}C) and bicrystal twist angle, and insensitive to
impurities (from the atmosphere). The cleavage energy for the ideal ABAB
graphite stacking, 0.39 +/- 0.02 J/m2, is calculated based upon a combination
of the measured CE and a theoretical calculation. These experimental
measurements are ideal for use in evaluating the efficacy of competing
theoretical approaches.
