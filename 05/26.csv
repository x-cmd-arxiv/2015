metrics. These equations correspond to a single $N$th order Lovelock term in
the action in $d=2N+1,\,2N+2$ dimensions, and they capture the relevant
gravitational dynamics when aproaching the big-bang singularity within the
Lovelock family of theories. Pure Lovelock gravity also bears out the general
feature that vacuum in the critical odd dimension, $d=2N+1$, is kinematic; i.e.
we may define an analogue Lovelock-Riemann tensor that vanishes in vacuum for
$d=2N+1$, yet the Riemann curvature is non-zero. We completely classify
isotropic and vacuum Kasner metrics for this class of theories in several
isotropy types. The different families can be characterized by means of certain
higher order 4th rank tensors. We also analyze in detail the space of vacuum
solutions for five and six dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet theory. It possesses
an interesting and illuminating geometric structure and symmetries that carry
over to the general case. We also comment on a closely related family of
exponential solutions and on the possibility of solutions with complex Kasner
exponents. We show that the latter imply the existence of closed timelike
curves in the geometry.

controlling only one parameter, spring tension at equilibrium. In the spectrum,
there always exist Dirac cones at K- and K'-points. As the tension is modified,
extra Dirac cones are created and annihilated in pairs. When the time reversal
symmetry is broken by uniform rotation of the system, creation and annihilation
of the Dirac cones result in a jump of the appropriately defined Chern number.
Then, a flip of the propagation direction of the chiral edge modes takes place,
which gives an experimental way to detect the topological transition. This is a
bulk-edge correspondence of the classical system. We also demonstrate the other
important concept, symmetry protection of the topological states, is at work in
the classical system. For the time reversal invariant case, the topological
edge modes exist for the fixed boundary condition but not for the free boundary
condition. This contrast originates from the symmetry breaking at the free

ground state of a Bose gas can be a normal phase, stripe phase, or magnetized
phase in different experimentally controllable parameter regimes. The
magnetized states are doubly degenerate and consist of a many-particle
two-state system. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium quantum
dynamics by switching on an external perturbation to induce resonant couplings
between the magnetized phases, and predict the novel quantum spin dynamics
which cannot be obtained in the single-particle systems. In particular, due to
particle-particle interactions, the transition of the Bose condensate from one
magnetized phase to the other is forbidden when the strength of external
perturbation is less than a critical value, and a full transition can occur
only when the perturbation exceeds such critical strength. This phenomenon
manifests itself a quantum dynamical phase transition, with the critical point
behavior being exactly solvable. From the numerical simulations and exact
analytic studies we show that the predicted many-body effects can be well
observed with the current experiments.

vertex is a function of the scale parameter, $s$, that has an interpretation of

constant, $g_\lambda$, depending on the associated momentum scale $\lambda =

up to the terms of third order, assuming some small value for $g_0$ at some
large $\lambda_0$. The result exhibits the same finite sensitivity to small-$x$

In contrast, current conventional PDN simulation solvers have to use fixed
step-size approach in order to reuse factorized matrices generated by the
expensive matrix decomposition. Based on the proposed exponential integration
framework, we design a PDN solver R-MATEX with the flexible time-stepping
capability. The key operation of matrix exponential and vector product (MEVP)
is computed by the rational Krylov subspace method.
  To further improve the runtime, we also propose a distributed computing
framework DR-MATEX. DR-MATEX reduces Krylov subspace generations caused by
frequent breakpoints from a large number of current sources during simulation.
By virtue of the superposition property of linear system and scaling invariance
property of Krylov subspace, DR-MATEX can divide the whole simulation task into
subtasks based on the alignments of breakpoints among those sources. The
subtasks are processed in parallel at different computing nodes without any
communication during the computation of transient simulation. The final result
is obtained by summing up the partial results among all the computing nodes
after they finish the assigned subtasks. Therefore, our computation model
belongs to the category known as Embarrassingly Parallel model.
  Experimental results show R-MATEX and DR-MATEX can achieve up to around 14.4X
and 98.0X runtime speedups over traditional trapezoidal integration based
solver with fixed timestep approach.

edge-preserving smoothing which separates the process into two different steps:
First the image is smoothed using a blurring filter and in the second step the

derived from the isomorph theory, which applies to any system that has strong

Such ""Roskilde-simple"" systems have a simplified thermodynamic phase diagram
deriving from the fact that they have curves (isomorphs) along which structure
and dynamics in reduced units are invariant to a good approximation. We show
that the Yukawa system has strong virial potential-energy correlations and
identify its isomorphs by two different methods. One method, the so-called
direct isomorph check, identifies isomorphs numerically from jumps of
relatively small density changes (here 10%). The second method identifies
isomorphs analytically from the pair potential. The curves obtained by the two
methods are close to each other; these curves are confirmed to be isomorphs by
demonstrating the invariance of the radial distribution function, the static
structure factor, the mean-square displacement as a function of time, and the
incoherent intermediate scattering function. Since the melting line is
predicted to be an isomorph, the theory provides a derivation of a known
approximate analytical expression for this line in the temperature-density
phase diagram. The paper's results give the first demonstration that the
isomorph theory can be applied to systems like dense colloidal suspensions and
strongly coupled dusty plasmas.

the identity. Each of these boundaries is divided into $C^{1,\alpha}$-surfaces

boundary blows-up to three half-spaces meeting along a line at 120 degree) and
isolated points of type $T$ (where the boundary blows up to the two-dimensional
cone over a one-dimensional regular tetrahedron). The diffeomorphisms $f_k$ are
compatible with this decomposition, in the sense that they bring regular points
into regular points and singular points of a kind into singular points of the
same kind. They are almost-normal, meaning that at fixed distance from the set
of singular points each $f_k$ is a normal deformation of $\partial\mathcal{E}$,
and at fixed distance from the points of type $T$, $f_k$ is a normal
deformation of the set of points of type $Y$. Finally, the tangential

improved convergence theorem is then used in the study of isoperimetric

complicated by the lingering effects of degeneracy and off-center ignition.
Here stars in this mass range are studied using a standard set of stellar
physics. Two important aspects of the study are the direct coupling of a
reaction network of roughly 220 nuclei to the structure calculation at all
stages and the use of a sub grid model to describe the convective bounded flame
that develops during neon and oxygen burning. Below 9.0 solar masses,
degenerate oxygen-neon cores form that may become either white dwarfs or
electron-capture supernovae. Above 10.3 solar masses the evolution proceeds
""normally"" to iron-core collapse, without composition inversions or degenerate
flashes. Emphasis here is upon the stars in between which typically ignite
oxygen burning off center. After oxygen burns in a convectively bounded flame,
silicon burning ignites in a degenerate flash that commences closer to the
stellar center and with increasing violence for stars of larger mass. In some
cases the silicon flash is so violent that it could lead to the early ejection
of the hydrogen envelope. This might have interesting observable consequences.
For example, the death of a 10.0 solar mass star could produce two
supernova-like displays, a faint low energy event due to the silicon flash, and
an unusually bright supernova many months later as the low energy ejecta from
core collapse collides with the previously ejected envelope. The potential
relation to the Crab supernova is discussed.

approximation that results in a truly isotropic equation of state. We have seen
that the magnetization obtained with both models is very different: while the
MIT model produces well-behaved curves that are always positive for large
magnetic fields, the NJL model yields a magnetization with lots of spikes and
negative values. This fact has strong consequences on the results based on the
existence of anisotropic equations of state. We have also seen that, while the
isotropic formalism results in maximum stellar masses that increase
considerably when the magnetic fields increase, maximum masses obtained with
the chaotic field approximation never vary more than 5.5$\%$. The effect of the
magnetic field on the radii is opposed in the MIT and NJL models: with both
formalisms, isotropic and chaotic field approximation, for a fixed mass, the
radii increase with the increase of the magnetic field in the MIT bag model and
decrease in the NJL, the radii of quark stars described by the NJL model being
smaller than the ones described by the MIT model.

orbiting nearby stars. Optical and near infrared spectra that exhibit many
hundreds of absorption lines can allow the m/s precision levels required for
such work. However, this means that studies have generally focused on
solar-type dwarf stars. After the main-sequence, intermediate-mass stars
(former A-F stars) expand and rotate slower than their progenitors, thus
thousands of narrow absorption lines appear in the optical region, permitting
the search for planetary Doppler signals in the data for these types of stars.
We present the discovery of two giant planets around the intermediate-mass
evolved star HIP65891 and HIP107773. The best Keplerian fit to the HIP65891 and
HIP107773 radial velocities leads to the following orbital parameters: P=1084.5
d; m$_b$sin$i$ = 6.0 M$_{jup}$; $e$=0.13 and P=144.3 d; m$_b$sin$i$ = 2.0
M$_{jup}$; $e$=0.09, respectively. In addition, we confirm the planetary nature
of the outer object orbiting the giant star HIP67851. The orbital parameters of
HIP67851c are: P=2131.8 d, m$_c$sin$i$ = 6.0 M$_{jup}$ and $e$=0.17. With
masses of 2.5 M$_\odot$ and 2.4 M$_\odot$ HIP65891 and HIP107773 are two of the
most massive stars known to host planets. Additionally, HIP67851 is one of five
giant stars that are known to host a planetary system having a close-in planet
($a <$ 0.7 AU). Based on the evolutionary states of those five stars, we
conclude that close-in planets do exist in multiple systems around subgiants
and slightly evolved giants stars, but probably they are subsequently destroyed
by the stellar envelope during the ascent of the red giant branch phase. As a
consequence, planetary systems with close-in objects are not found around
horizontal branch stars.

oppositely directed coupler in the presence of high-order effects is
investigated. By using the standard linear stability analysis, we obtain the
instability gain that exhibits a significant change in the bands of instability
due to the effects of a saturable nonlinearity. We also show that even in the
presence of saturation there is no change in instability gain when we compare
the results obtained for both channels not influenced by self-steepening effect
or for both channels influenced by self-steepening effect but opposite in sign.
Regarding the Raman effect, there is reflection symmetry (asymmetry) to the
gain at zero perturbation frequency when the values of the Raman coefficients
in each directional coupler are equal and with same (opposite) sign. For the
anomalous group velocity dispersion regime we observe that the growth of the
saturation parameter is followed by an increase in the null gain region near
{\Omega} = 0, enlarging the separation of the instability bands close to this
point. Finally, we show that an efficient control of the modulation instability
can be realized by adjusting self-steepening effect and intrapulse Raman
scattering, even in the presence of a saturable nonlinearity.

disentangling the different contributions experimentally. We also discuss the

Ku observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star MWC
758. The Ka image shows a compact emission region in the outer disk indicating
a strong concentration of big dust grains. Tracing smaller grains, archival
ALMA data in band 7 continuum shows extended disk emission with an intensity
maximum to the north-west of the central star, which matches the VLA clump
position. The compactness of the Ka emission is expected in the context of dust
trapping, as big grains are trapped more easily than smaller grains in gas
pressure maxima. We develop a non-axisymmetric parametric model inspired by a
steady state vortex solution with parameters adequately selected to reproduce
the observations, including the spectral energy distribution. Finally, we
compare the radio continuum with SPHERE scattered light data. The ALMA
continuum spatially coincides with a spiral-like feature seen in scattered
light, while the VLA clump is offset from the scattered light maximum.
Moreover, the ALMA map shows a decrement that matches a region devoid of

the AGN then requires to photoionize a large fraction of the host galaxy. Based
on the typical light travel time across massive galaxies, and the observed
fraction of X-ray selected AGN without AGN-photoionized narrow lines, we
estimate that the AGN phase typically lasts $\sim10^{5}$ years. This lifetime
is short compared to the total growth time of $10^{7}-10^{9}$ years estimated
from e.g. the Soltan argument and implies that black holes grow via many such
short bursts and that AGN therefore ""flicker"" on and off. We discuss some
consequences of this flickering behavior for AGN feedback and the analogy of
X-ray binaries and AGN lifecycles.

excluding a low-mass outlier, corresponding to progenitor masses of $\sim$3 to
4 M$_\odot$. This region of the initial final mass relation (IFMR) has large

relation adopted over the full observed white dwarf mass range in many previous

also has a consistently steep slope. This strong consistency also suggests that
there is no significant metallicity dependence of the IFMR at this mass and

4.078_{-0.054}^{+0.049}$, $[Fe/H] = 0.272\pm0.038$, an inferred mass
$M_{*}=1.211_{-0.066}^{+0.078}$ M$_{\odot}$, and radius
$R_{*}=1.67_{-0.12}^{+0.14}$ R$_{\odot}$. The planetary companion has mass $M_P
= 0.867_{-0.061}^{+0.065}$ $M_{J}$, radius $R_P = 1.86_{-0.16}^{+0.18}$
$R_{J}$, surface gravity $\log{g_{P}} = 2.793_{-0.075}^{+0.072}$, and density
$\rho_P = 0.167_{-0.038}^{+0.047}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The planet is on a roughly
circular orbit with semimajor axis $a = 0.04571_{-0.00084}^{+0.00096}$ AU and
eccentricity $e = 0.035_{-0.025}^{+0.050}$. The best-fit linear ephemeris is
$T_0 = 2456883.4803 \pm 0.0007$ BJD$_{\rm TDB}$ and $P = 3.24406 \pm 0.00016$
days. This planet is one of the most inflated of all known transiting
exoplanets, making it one of the few members of a class of extremely low
density, highly-irradiated gas giants. The low stellar $\log{g}$ and large
implied radius are supported by stellar density constraints from follow-up
light curves, plus an evolutionary and space motion analysis. We also develop a
new technique to extract high precision radial velocities from noisy spectra
that reduces the observing time needed to confirm transiting planet candidates.
This planet boasts deep transits of a bright star, a large inferred atmospheric
scale height, and a high equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq}=1675^{+61}_{-55}$
K, assuming zero albedo and perfect heat redistribution, making it one of the
best targets for future atmospheric characterization studies.

in quantum phase transitions is based to a large extent on the recent intensive
studies of entanglement in many-body systems. In contrast, much less is known
about the role of quantum nonlocality in these systems, mostly because the
available multipartite Bell inequalities involve high-order correlations among
many particles, which are hard to access theoretically, and even harder
experimentally. Standard, ""theorist- and experimentalist-friendly"" many-body
observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...)
particles. Typically, there is no multipartite Bell inequality for this
scenario based on such low-order correlations. Recently, however, we have
succeeded in constructing multipartite Bell inequalities that involve two- and
one-body correlations only, and showed how they revealed the nonlocality in
many-body systems relevant for nuclear and atomic physics [Science 344, 1256
(2014)]. With the present contribution we continue our work on this problem. On
the one hand, we present a detailed derivation of the above Bell inequalities,
pertaining to permutation symmetry among the involved parties. On the other
hand, we present a couple of new results concerning such Bell inequalities.
First, we characterize their tightness. We then discuss maximal quantum
violations of these inequalities in the general case, and their scaling with
the number of parties. Moreover, we provide new classes of two-body Bell
inequalities which reveal nonlocality of the Dicke states---ground states of
physically relevant and experimentally realizable Hamiltonians. Finally, we
shortly discuss various scenarios for nonlocality detection in mesoscopic
systems of trapped ions or atoms, and by atoms trapped in the vicinity of
designed nanostructures.

emission-line spectroscopy of 96 GRB-selected galaxies at 0.1<z<3.6, the
largest sample of GRB host spectroscopy available to date. Most of our GRBs
were detected by Swift and 76% are at 0.5<z<2.5 with a median z~1.6. Based on
Balmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measure
systemic redshifts, star formation rates (SFRs), visual attenuations, oxygen
abundances (12+log(O/H)), and emission-line widths. We find a strong change of
the typical physical properties of GRB hosts with redshift. The median SFR, for
example, increases from ~0.6 M_sun/yr at z~0.6 up to ~15 M_sun/yr at z~2. A
higher ratio of [OIII]/[OII] at higher redshifts leads to an increasing
distance of GRB-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the BPT
diagram. Oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between
12+log(O/H)=7.9 and 12+log(O/H)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(O/H)~8.5. The
fraction of GRB-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20%
at z<1 in the adopted metallicity scale. This is significantly less than the
fraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that GRBs are
scarce in high-metallicity environments. At z~3, sensitivity limits us to
probing only the most luminous GRB hosts for which we derive metallicities of Z
~< 0.5 Z_sun. Together with a high incidence of galaxies with similar
metallicity in our sample at z~1.5, this indicates that the metallicity
dependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z~3.

explosion energy, and an amount and distribution of radioactive nickel, SNEC
generates the bolometric light curve, as well as the light curves in different
broad bands assuming black body emission. As a first application of SNEC, we
consider the explosions of a grid of 15 Msun (at zero-age main sequence) stars
whose hydrogen envelopes are stripped to different extents and at different
points in their evolution. The resulting light curves exhibit plateaus with
durations of ~20-100 days if >~1.5-2 Msun of hydrogen-rich material is left and
no plateau if less hydrogen-rich material is left. If these shorter plateau
lengths are not seen for Type IIP supernovae in nature, it suggests that, at
least for zero-age main sequence masses <~ 20 Msun, hydrogen mass loss occurs
as an all or nothing process. This perhaps points to the important role binary
interactions play in generating the observed mass-stripped supernovae (i.e.,
Type Ib/c events). These light curves are also unlike what is typically seen
for Type IIL supernovae, arguing that simply varying the amount of mass loss
cannot explain these events. The most stripped models begin to show
double-peaked light curves similar to what is often seen for Type IIb
supernovae, confirming previous work that these supernovae can come from
progenitors that have a small amount of hydrogen and a radius of ~500 Rsun.

demonstrate both efficacy and efficiency -- over 95% of potential attacks were

potentially augmenting the credibility of online recommendation to prevent

We derive a time-dependent dynamical theory for this collective many-body
system which allows us to study the real time evolution of the photon transport
and the atomic excitations. Our analytical result is consistent with previous
numerical calculations when there is only one atom. For an atomic chain, the
collective interaction between the atoms mediated by the waveguide mode can
significantly change the dynamics of the system. The reflectivity of a photon
can be tuned by changing the ratio of coupling strength and the photon
linewidth or by changing the number of atoms in the chain. The reflectivity of
a single photon pulse with finite bandwidth can even approach $100\%$. The
spectrum of the reflected and transmitted photon can also be significantly
different from the single atom case. Many interesting physical phenomena can
occur in this system such as the photonic bandgap effects, quantum entanglement
generation, Fano-like interference, and superradiant effects. For engineering,
this system may serve as a single photon frequency filter, single photon
modulation and may find important applications in quantum information.

Second, we revisit the current proof techniques and answer the natural question
of how far we are from meaningful and provable security guarantees, when
instantiating weak PRFs with standard primitives (block ciphers or hash
functions). In particular, we demonstrate a flaw in the recent (TCC'14)

The forward proton calorimeter detectors are described and a procedure for
determining collision centrality with these detectors is detailed. The
deposition of energy by deuteron spectator nucleons in the forward calorimeters
is used to identify p+Au and n+Au collisions in the data. A weighted
combination of the yield of p+Au and n+Au is constructed to build a reference
for Au+Au collisions that better matches the isospin composition of the gold
nucleus. The p_T and centrality dependence of the yield of this improved
reference system is found to match that of d+Au. The shape of the charged
particle transverse momentum distribution is observed to extrapolate smoothly
from pbar+p to central d+Au as a function of the charged particle
pseudorapidity density. The asymmetry of positively- and negatively-charged
hadron production in p+Au is compared to that of n+Au. No significant asymmetry
is observed at mid-rapidity. These studies augment recent results from
experiments at the LHC and RHIC facilities to give a more complete description
of particle production in p+A and d+A collisions, essential for the
understanding the medium produced in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.

upon cooling, characterizes the glass-forming ability (GFA) of the system.
While pure metals are typically poor glass formers with $\mathcal
{R}_c>10^{12}\, {\rm K/s}$, specific multi-component alloys can form bulk
metallic glasses (BMGs) even at cooling rates below $\mathcal {R}\sim 1\, {\rm
K/s}$. Conventional wisdom asserts that metal alloys with three or more
components are better glass formers (with smaller ${\cal R}_c$) than binary
alloys. However, there is currently no theoretical framework that provides
quantitative predictions for $\mathcal{R}_c$ for multi-component alloys. We
perform simulations of ternary hard-sphere systems, which have been shown to be
accurate models for the glass-forming ability of BMGs, to understand the roles
of geometric frustration and demixing in determining $\mathcal {R}_c$.
Specifically, we compress ternary hard sphere mixtures into jammed packings and
measure the critical compression rate, below which the system crystallizes, as
a function of the diameter ratios $\sigma_B/\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_C/\sigma_A$
and number fractions $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$. We find two distinct regimes for
the GFA in parameter space for ternary hard spheres. When the diameter ratios
are close to $1$, such that the largest ($A$) and smallest ($C$) species are
well-mixed, the GFA of ternary systems is no better than that of the optimal
binary glass former. However, when $\sigma_C/\sigma_A \lesssim 0.8$ is below
the demixing threshold for binary systems, adding a third component $B$ with
$\sigma_C < \sigma_B < \sigma_A$ increases the GFA of the system by preventing
demixing of $A$ and $C$. Analysis of the available data from experimental
studies indicates that most ternary BMGs are below the binary demixing
threshold with $\sigma_C/\sigma_A < 0.8$.

zero-mass limit, while some general arguments suggest that strictly massless
charge does not not radiate at all. On the other hand, the regularized
classical radiation reaction force, though looking odd, is non-zero and finite.
To clarify this controversy, we consider radiation problem in massless scalar
quantum electrodynamics in the external magnetic field. In this framework,
synchrotron radiation is found to be non-zero, finite, and essentially quantum.
Its spectral distribution is calculated using Schwinger's proper time technique
for {\em ab initio} massless particle of zero spin. Provided $E^2\gg eH$, the
maximum in the spectrum is shown to be at $\hbar \omega=E/3$, and the average
photon energy is $4E/9$. The normalized spectrum is universal, depending
neither on $E$ nor on $H$. Quantum nature of radiation makes classical
radiation reaction equation meaningless for massless charge. Our results are
consistent with the view (supported by the renormalization group argument) that
the correct classical limit of massless quantum electrodynamics is free theory.

Efficient thermoelectric devices require high voltage generation from a

low thermal conductivity. For a given thermal conductivity and temperature, the
thermoelectric powerfactor is determined by the electronic structure of the
material. Low dimensionality (1D and 2D) opens new routes to high powerfactor
due to the unique density of states (DOS) of confined electrons and holes. 2D
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent a new class of
thermoelectric materials not only due to such confinement effects, but
especially due to their large effective masses and valley degeneracies. Here we
report a powerfactor of $MoS_2$ as large as $8.5 mWm^{-1}K^{-2}$ at room
temperature, which is amongst the highest measured in traditional, gapped
thermoelectric materials. To obtain these high powerfactors, we perform
thermoelectric measurements on few-layer $MoS_2$ in the metallic regime, which
allows us to access the 2D DOS near the conduction band edge and exploit the
effect of 2D confinement on electron scattering rates, which result in a large
Seebeck coefficient. The demonstrated high, electronically modulated
powerfactor in 2D TMDCs holds promise for efficient thermoelectric energy
conversion.

two-dimensional binary mixtures composed of hard disks and hard ellipses, where
both types of particles have the same area. We demonstrate that characteristic
glass-formation behavior appears upon compression under appropriate conditions
in such systems. In particular, while a rotational glass transition occurs only
for the ellipses, both types of particles undergo a kinetic arrest in the
translational degrees of freedom at a single density. The translational
dynamics for the ellipses is found to be faster than that for the disks within
the same system, indicating that shape anisotropy promotes the translational
motion of particles. We further examine the influence of mixture's composition
and aspect ratio on the glass formation. For the mixtures with an ellipse
aspect ratio of $k=2$, both translational and rotational glass transition
densities decrease with increasing the disk concentration at a similar rate and
hence, the two glass transitions remain close to each other at all
concentrations investigated. By elevating $k$, however, the rotational glass
transition density diminishes at a faster rate than the translational one,
leading to the formation of an orientational glass for the ellipses between the
two transitions. Our simulations imply that mixtures of particles with
different shapes emerge as a promising model for probing the role of particle
shape in determining the properties of glass-forming liquids. Furthermore, our
work illustrates the potential of using knowledge concerning the dependence of
glass-formation properties on mixture's composition and particle shape to
assist in the rational design of amorphous materials.

plasma and gravitational lensing introduces novel effects to the paths of light
rays passing by a massive object. The plasma contributes additional terms to
the equations of motion, and the resulting ray trajectories are
frequency-dependent. Lensing phenomena and circular orbits are investigated for
plasma density distributions $N \propto 1/r^h$ with $h \geq 0$ in the
Schwarzschild space-time. For rays passing by the mass near the plasma
frequency refractive effects can dominate, effectively turning the
gravitational lens into a mirror. We obtain the turning points, circular orbit
radii, and angular momentum for general $h$. Previous results have shown that
light rays behave like massive particles with an effective mass given by the
plasma frequency for a constant density $h=0$. We study the behaviour for
general $h$ and show that when $h=2$ the plasma term acts like an additional
contribution to the angular momentum of the passing ray. When $h=3$ the
potential and radii of circular orbits are analogous to those found in studies
of massless scalar fields on the Schwarzschild background. As a physically
motivated example we study the pulse profiles of a compact object with
antipodal hotspots sheathed in a dense plasma, which shows dramatic
frequency-dependent shifts from the behaviour in vacuum. Finally, we consider
the potential observability and applications of such frequency-dependent plasma
effects in general relativity for several types of neutron star.

a common convolutional architecture either deployed globally on the image to
compute class posterior distributions, or restricted locally to compute class

boxes determined by proposal heuristics. In theory, averaging the latter should
yield inferior performance compared to proper marginalization. Yet empirical
evidence suggests the converse, leading us to conclude that - at the current

improved sampling techniques for heuristic proposal schemes that improve

accreting planetary cores. These CPDs have eluded unequivocal detection -their
identification requires predictions in CPD tracers. In this work, we aim to
assess the observability of embedded CPDs with ALMA as features imprinted in
the gas kinematics. We use 3D Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of
CPDs around 1 and 5 M_Jup planets at large stellocentric radii, in locally
isothermal and adiabatic disks. The simulations are then connected with 3D
radiative transfer for predictions in CO isotopologues. Observability is
assessed by corrupting with realistic long baseline phase noise extracted from
the recent HL Tau ALMA data. We find that the presence of a CPD produces
distinct signposts: 1) compact emission separated in velocity from the overall
circumstellar disk's Keplerian pattern, 2) a strong impact on the velocity
pattern when the Doppler shifted line emission sweeps across the CPD location,
and 3) a local increase in the velocity dispersion. We test our predictions
with a simulation tailored for HD 100546 -which has a reported protoplanet
candidate. We find that the CPDs are detectable in all 3 signposts with ALMA
Cycle 3 capabilities for both 1 and 5 M_Jup protoplanets, when embedded in an

the base-station can only communicate with some of the subsystems that we refer

Hence, we focus on leader-reachability and investigate the corresponding

specific challenges to learning algorithms since their non-additive nature

  In this paper we reveal that for two large families of performance measures
that can be expressed as functions of true positive/negative rates, it is
indeed possible to implement point stochastic updates. The families we consider

However, despite its popularity, there exist significant gaps in our
understanding of this problem and its associated performance measure.
  The most notable of these is the lack of a convex upper bounding surrogate
for prec@k. We also lack scalable perceptron and stochastic gradient descent
algorithms for optimizing this performance measure. In this paper we make key

truly upper bounding surrogates for prec@k. These surrogates are motivated in a
principled manner and enjoy attractive properties such as consistency to prec@k
under various natural margin/noise conditions.
  These surrogates are then used to design a class of novel perceptron
algorithms for optimizing prec@k with provable mistake bounds. We also devise
scalable stochastic gradient descent style methods for this problem with
provable convergence bounds. Our proofs rely on novel uniform convergence
bounds which require an in-depth analysis of the structural properties of
prec@k and its surrogates. We conclude with experimental results comparing our

representations characterize sentence structure, but do not capture the graded
aspect of meaning. Distributional models give graded similarity ratings for
words and phrases, but do not capture sentence structure in the same detail as
logic-based approaches. So it has been argued that the two are complementary.
We adopt a hybrid approach that combines logic-based and distributional
semantics through probabilistic logic inference in Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs). In this paper, we focus on the three components of a practical system
integrating logical and distributional models: 1) Parsing and task
representation is the logic-based part where input problems are represented in
probabilistic logic. This is quite different from representing them in standard
first-order logic. 2) For knowledge base construction we form weighted
inference rules. We integrate and compare distributional information with other
sources, notably WordNet and an existing paraphrase collection. In particular,
we use our system to evaluate distributional lexical entailment approaches. We
use a variant of Robinson resolution to determine the necessary inference
rules. More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our
system learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences
between resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to
solve the inference problems efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we use the
task of textual entailment (RTE), which can utilize the strengths of both
logic-based and distributional representations. In particular we focus on the
SICK dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

those simulations with respect to finite trace semantics. Moreover, those
simulations can be aided by forward partial execution (FPE)---a categorical
transformation of systems previously introduced by the authors.
  In this paper, we give Kleisli simulation a theoretical foundation that
assures its soundness also with respect to infinitary traces. There, following
Jacobs' work, infinitary trace semantics is characterized as the ""largest
homomorphism."" It turns out that soundness of forward simulations is rather
straightforward; that of backward simulation holds too, although it requires
certain additional conditions and its proof is more involved. We also show that
FPE can be successfully employed in the infinitary trace setting to enhance the
applicability of Kleisli simulations as witnesses of trace inclusion. Our
framework is parameterized in the monad for branching as well as in the functor
for linear-time behaviors; for the former we mainly use the powerset monad (for
nondeterminism), the sub-Giry monad (for probability), and the lift monad (for

fundamental task in distributed multi-camera surveillance systems. Although a
variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most
of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics
either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we
formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these
key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that
the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank
within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is
proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the
gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity
scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels.
The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not
rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art
approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging
VIPeR, CUHK-01 and CAVIAR4REID datasets. Additionally, our approach has better
ability to generalize across datasets without fine-tuning.

analysis (MRA) is proposed and a new finite element method is hence presented.
The MRA framework is formulated out of a mutually nesting displacement subspace
sequence whose basis functions are constructed of scaling and shifting on the
element domain of basic node shape function. The basic node shape function is
constructed by extending the node shape function of a traditional Mindlin plate
element to other three quadrants around the coordinate zero point. As a result,
a new rational MRA concept together with the resolution level (RL) is
constituted for the element. The traditional 4-node rectangular Mindlin plate
element and method is a mono-resolution one and also a special case of the
proposed element and method. The meshing for the monoresolution plate element
model is based on the empiricism while the RL adjusting for the multiresolution
is laid on the rigorous mathematical basis. The analysis clarity of a plate
structure is actually determined by the RL, not by the mesh. Thus, the accuracy
of a plate structural analysis is replaced by the clarity, the irrational MRA
by the rational and the mesh model by the RL that is the discretized model by
the integrated.

Liang, Spekkens and Wiseman (LSW) derived an inequality for generalized
noncontextual models that doesn't assume determinism, and applies already to a

(end-on view) and displays a quasi vertical-thread structure. Bright
U-shape/horn-like structure is observed surrounding the upper portion of the
prominence at 171 angstrom before the eruption and becomes more prominent
during the eruption. The disk view of STEREO-B shows that this long prominence
is composed of a series of vertical threads and displays a half loop-like
structure during the eruption. We focus on the magnetic support of the
prominence vertical threads by studying the structure and dynamics of the
prominence before and during the eruption using observations from SDO and
STEREO-B. We also construct a series of magnetic field models (sheared arcade
model, twisted flux rope model, and unstable model with hyperbolic flux tube
(HFT)). Various observational characteristics appear to be in favor of the
twisted flux rope model. We find that the flux rope supporting the prominence
enters the regime of torus instability at the onset of the fast rise phase, and
signatures of reconnection (post-eruption arcade, new U-shape structure, rising
blobs) appear about one hour later. During the eruption, AIA observes dark
ribbons seen in absorption at 171 angstrom corresponding to the bright ribbons
shown at 304 angstrom, which might be caused by the erupting filament material
falling back along the newly reconfigured magnetic fields. Brightenings at the
inner edge of the erupting prominence arcade are also observed in all AIA EUV
channels, which might be caused by the heating due to energy released from
reconnection below the rising prominence.

preferred by peculiar velocity cosmology, since it is free of uncertainties of
galaxy density bias entangled in mass-weighted statistics. However, measuring
the volume-weighted velocity statistics from galaxy (halo/simulation particle)
velocity data is challenging. For the first time, we apply the Kriging
interpolation to obtain the volume-weighted velocity field. Kriging is a
minimum variance estimator. It predicts the most likely velocity for each place
based on the velocity at other places. We test the performance of Kriging
quantified by the E-mode velocity power spectrum from simulations. Dependences
on the variogram prior used in Kriging, the number $n_k$ of the nearby
particles to interpolate and the density $n_P$ of the observed sample are
investigated. First, we find that Kriging induces $1\%$ and $3\%$ systematics
at $k\sim 0.1h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ when $n_P\sim 6\times 10^{-2} ({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$
and $n_P\sim 6\times 10^{-3} ({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, respectively. The deviation
increases for decreasing $n_P$ and increasing $k$. When $n_P\lesssim 6\times
10^{-4} ({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, a smoothing effect dominates small scales, causing
significant underestimation of the velocity power spectrum. Second, increasing
$n_k$ helps to recover small scale power. However, for $n_P\lesssim 6\times
10^{-4} ({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$ cases, the recovery is limited. Finally, Kriging is
more sensitive to the variogram prior for lower sample density. The most
straightforward application of Kriging on the cosmic velocity field does not
show obvious advantages over the nearest-particle method (Zheng et al. 2013)
and could not be directly applied to cosmology so far. However, whether
potential improvements may be achieved by more delicate versions of Kriging is
worth further investigation.

from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against malware and
compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes, less clear is
whether such isolation is effective against different kind of cross-app
resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To better understand the
problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we conducted a systematic
security analysis on MAC OS~X and iOS. Our research leads to the discovery of a
series of high-impact security weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious
app, approved by the Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps'
sensitive data. More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction
services, including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS~X and URL
Scheme on the MAC OS and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal such
confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and bank, and the
secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the app sandbox on OS~X was
found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private directory to the sandboxed
malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As a result, sensitive user data,
like the notes and user contacts under Evernote and photos under WeChat, have
all been disclosed. Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of
app-to-app and app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts,
we developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of MAC OS and
iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their code.
Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness of the
weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not be easily
fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts on OS~X, helping
protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be fully addressed.

higher than 1.5 MHz, in order the manipulator to be able to reach high speed

One promising solution to improve the capacity for these vehicular users is to
employ moving relays or car base stations. The system forms cell inside the
vehicle and then uses rooftop antenna for back-hauling to overcome the
vehicular penetration loss. In this paper, we develop a model for aggregate
interference distribution generated from moving/parked cars to indoor users in
order to study whether indoor femto-cells can coexist on the same spectrum with
vehicular communications. Since spectrum authorization for vehicular
communications is open at moment, we consider two spectrum sharing scenarios
(i) communication from mounted antennas on the roof of the vehicles to the
infrastructure network utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells (ii)
in-vehicle communication utilizes same spectrum with indoor femto-cells while
vehicular to infrastructure (V2I) communication is allocated at different
spectrum. Based on our findings we suggest that V2I and indoor femto-cells
should be allocated at different spectrum. The reason being that mounted
roof-top antennas facing the indoor cells generate unacceptable interference
levels. On the other hand, in-vehicle communication and indoor cells can share

to multiple users in a multi-cell wireless network where multiple unicast
streaming sessions are run in parallel and share the same frequency band. Each
streaming session is formed by the sequential transmission of video ""chunks,""
such that each chunk arrives into the corresponding user playback buffer within
its playback deadline. We formulate the problem as a Network Utility
Maximization (NUM) where the objective is to fairly maximize users' video
streaming Quality of Experience (QoE) and then derive an iterative control
policy using Lyapunov Optimization, which solves the NUM problem up to any
level of accuracy and yields an online protocol with control actions at every
iteration decomposing into two layers interconnected by the users' request
queues : i) a video streaming adaptation layer reminiscent of DASH, implemented
at each user node; ii) a transmission scheduling layer where a max-weight
scheduler is implemented at each base station. The proposed chunk request
scheme is a pull strategy where every user opportunistically requests video
chunks from the neighboring base stations and dynamically adapts the quality of
its requests based on the current size of the request queue. For the
transmission scheduling component, we first describe the general max-weight
scheduler and then particularize it to a wireless network where the base
stations have multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) beamforming capabilities. We exploit the
channel hardening effect of large-dimensional MIMO channels (massive MIMO) and
devise a low complexity user selection scheme to solve the underlying
combinatorial problem of selecting user subsets for downlink beamforming, which
can be easily implemented and run independently at each base station.

simple consistency requirements often turn out to be unrealizable because of
the complicated information flow in the distributed system: not all information
is available in every component, and information transmitted from other
components may arrive with a delay or not at all, especially in the presence of
faults. The problem of checking the distributed realizability of a temporal
specification is, in general, undecidable. Semi-algorithms for synthesis, such
as bounded synthesis, are only useful in the positive case, where they
construct an implementation for a realizable specification, but not in the
negative case: if the specification is unrealizable, the search for the
implementation never terminates. In this paper, we introduce counterexamples to
distributed realizability and present a method for the detection of such
counterexamples for specifications given in linear-time temporal logic (LTL). A
counterexample consists of a set of paths, each representing a different
sequence of inputs from the environment, such that, no matter how the
components are implemented, the specification is violated on at least one of
these paths. We present a method for finding such counterexamples both for the
classic distributed realizability problem and for the fault-tolerant
realizability problem. Our method considers, incrementally, larger and larger
sets of paths until a counterexample is found. For safety specifications in
weakly ordered architectures we obtain a decision procedure, while
counterexamples for full LTL and arbitrary architectures may consist of
infinitely many paths. Experimental results, obtained with a QBF-based
prototype implementation, show that our method finds simple errors very
quickly, and even problems with high combinatorial complexity, like the
Byzantine Generals' Problem, are tractable.

speedup with respect to the conventional sequential Thomas algorithm is
assessed for various types of the application of the method. It is observed
that the maximum of the analytical speedup for a given number of blocks on the
diagonal is achieved at some finite number of parallel processors. The values
of the parameters required to reach the maximum computational speedup are
obtained. The benchmark calculations show a good agreement of analytical

the finite-differences over the first coordinate and spline approximation over

immersed in an active bath: from proteins on active membranes to microscopic
swimmers confined by boundaries. The non-equilibrium forces exerted by the
active bath on the inclusions or boundaries often regulate function, and such
forces may also be exploited in artificial active materials. Nonetheless, the
general phenomenology of these active forces remains elusive. We show that the
fluctuation spectrum of the active medium, the partitioning of energy as a
function of wavenumber, controls the phenomenology of force generation. We find
that for a narrow, unimodal spectrum, the force exerted by a non-equilibrium
system on two embedded walls depends on the width and the position of the peak
in the fluctuation spectrum, and oscillates between repulsion and attraction as
a function of wall separation. We examine two apparently disparate examples:
the Maritime Casimir effect and recent simulations of active Brownian
particles. A key implication of our work is that important non-equilibrium
interactions are encoded within the fluctuation spectrum. In this sense the
noise becomes the signal.

transmission of composite Gaussian measurements over an additive white Gaussian
noise fading channel under an average power constraint. If the channel state
information (CSI) is known by both the encoder and decoder, the optimal LT
scheme in terms of the average mean-square error distortion is characterized
under a strict delay constraint, and a graphical interpretation of the optimal
power allocation strategy is presented. Then, for general delay constraints,
two LT strategies are proposed based on the solution to a particular multiple
measurements-parallel channels scenario. It is shown that the distortion
decreases as the delay constraint is relaxed, and when the delay constraint is
completely removed, both strategies achieve the optimal performance under
certain matching conditions. If the CSI is known only by the decoder, the
optimal LT strategy is derived under a strict delay constraint. The extension
for general delay constraints is shown to be hard. As a first step towards
understanding the structure of the optimal scheme in this case, it is shown
that for the multiple measurements-parallel channels scenario, any LT scheme
that uses only a one-to-one linear mapping between measurements and channels is
suboptimal in general.

by interpreting the MIMO system in terms of a multirate synthesis filter bank.
The proposed methodology is discussed in two steps: in the first step the MIMO
system is interpreted as a synthesis filter bank and the second step is to
convert the MIMO system into a SISO system ""without any loss of information"",
which re-structures the system identification problem into a SISO form. The
system identification problem, in its new form, is identical to the problem of
obtaining the signal matched synthesis filter bank (SMSFB) as proposed in Part
II. Since we have developed fast algorithms to obtain the filter bank
coefficients in Part II, for ""the given data case"" as well as ""the given
statistics case"", we can use these algorithm for the MIMO system identification
as well. This framework can have an adaptive as well as block processing
implementation. The algorithms, used here, involve only scalar computations,
unlike the conventional MIMO system identification algorithms where one
requires matrix computations. These order recursive algorithm can also be used
to obtain approximate smaller order model for large order systems without using
any model order reduction algorithm. The proposed identification framework can
also be used for SISO LPTV system identification and also for a SIMO or MISO
system. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is validated and its performance in
the presence of measurement noise is illustrated using simulation results.

of the first known $z \sim 7$ quasar, ULAS J1120+0641, recently provided
exciting evidence of a significantly neutral IGM. This long-awaited signature
of reionization was inferred, in part, from a deficit of flux in the quasar's
Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line based on predictions from a composite of
lower-redshift quasars. The composite sample was chosen based on its C IV
emission line properties; however, as the original study by Mortlock et al.
noted, the composite contained a slight velocity offset in C IV compared to
ULAS J1120+0641. Here we test whether this offset may be related to the
predicted strength of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line. We confirm the
significant ($\sim 10$ per cent at r.m.s.) scatter in Lyman-$\alpha$ flux for
quasars of a given C IV velocity and equivalent width found by Mortlock et al.
We further find that among lower-redshift objects chosen to more closely match
the C IV properties of ULAS J1120+0641, its Lyman-$\alpha$ emission falls
within the observed distribution of fluxes. Among lower-redshift quasars chosen
to more closely match in C IV velocity and equivalent width, we find that ULAS
J1120+0641 falls within the observed distribution of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission
line strengths. This suggests that damping wing absorption may not be present,
potentially weakening the case for neutral gas around this object. Larger
samples of z$>$7 quasars may therefore be needed to establish a clearer picture
of the IGM neutral fraction at these redshifts.

cluster, like magnetic molecules and nanoparticles, single electron, cold atom
clouds, is one of the most stimulating challenges of applied and basic research
of the next years. In particular, the magnetic nanoparticle investigation plays
a fundamental role for the modern material science and its relative
technological applications like ferrofluids, magnetic refrigeration and
biomedical applications, including drug delivery, hyper-thermia cancer
treatment and magnetic resonance imaging contrast-agent. In this framework,
several efforts have been devoted to the development of a high sensitivity
magnetic nanosensor pushing sensing capability to the individual spin level.
Among the different magnetic sensors, Superconducting QUantum Interference
Devices (SQUIDs) exhibit an ultra high sensitivity and are widely employed in
numerous applications. In the recent years, it has been proved that the
magnetic response of nano-objects can be effectively measured by using a SQUID
with a very small sensitive area (nanoSQUID). In fact, the sensor noise,
expressed in terms of the elementary magnetic moment (spin or Bohr magneton),
is linearly dependent on the SQUID loop side length. For this reason, SQUIDs
have been progressively miniaturized in order to improve the sensitivity up to
few spin per unit of bandwidth. With respect to other techniques, nanoSQUIDs
offer the advantage of direct measurement of magnetization changes in small
spin systems. In this review, we focus on nanoSQUIDs and its applications. In
particular, we will discuss the motivations, the theoretical aspects, the

filters covering the 250-1000 nm wavelength range shows a red spectral
behavior, without clear absorption bands except for a potential absorption
centered at $\sim$ 290 nm that is possibly due to SO$_2$ ice. The nucleus shows
strong phase reddening, with disk-averaged spectral slopes increasing from
11\%/(100 nm) to 16\%/(100 nm) in the 1.3$^{\circ}$--54$^{\circ}$ phase angle
range. The geometric albedo of the comet is 6.5$\pm$0.2\% at 649 nm, with local
variations of up to $\sim$ 16\% in the Hapi region. From the disk-resolved
images we computed the spectral slope together with local spectrophotometry and
identified three distinct groups of regions (blue, moderately red, and red).
The Hapi region is the brightest, the bluest in term of spectral slope, and the

methods in phylogenetic estimation. However, in recent years it has become more
and more apparent that phylogenetic trees are often not sufficient to describe
evolution accurately. For instance, processes like hybridization or lateral
gene transfer that are commonplace in many groups of organisms and result in
mosaic patterns of relationships cannot be represented by a single phylogenetic
tree. This is why phylogenetic networks, which can display such events, are
becoming of more and more interest in phylogenetic research. It is therefore
necessary to extend concepts like maximum parsimony from phylogenetic trees to
networks. Several suggestions for possible extensions can be found in recent
literature, for instance the softwired and the hardwired parsimony concepts. In
this paper, we analyze the so-called big parsimony problem under these two
concepts, i.e. we investigate maximum parsimonious networks and analyze their
properties. In particular, we show that finding a softwired maximum parsimony
network is possible in polynomial time. We also show that the set of maximum
parsimony networks for the hardwired definition always contains at least one
phylogenetic tree. Lastly, we investigate some parallels of parsimony to
different likelihood concepts on phylogenetic networks.

Its 19 consecutive dipole gravity modes constitute a series with almost
constant period spacing. This unique collection of identified modes probes the
near-core environment of this star and holds the potential to reveal the size
and structure of the overshooting zone on top of the convective core, as well
as the mixing properties of the star. We pursue forward seismic modelling based
on adiabatic eigenfrequencies of equilibrium models for eight extensive
evolutionary grids tuned to KIC 10526294, by varying the initial mass,
metallicity, chemical mixture, and the extent of the overshooting layer on top
of the convective core. We examine models for both OP and OPAL opacities and
test the occurrence of extra diffusive mixing. We find a tight mass,
metallicity relation within the ranges $M$ ~ 3.13 to 3.25 Msun and $Z$ ~ 0.014
to 0.028. We deduce that an exponentially decaying diffusive core overshooting
prescription describes the seismic data better than a step function formulation
and derive a value of $f_{ov}$ between 0.017 and 0.018. Moreover, the inclusion
of extra diffusive mixing with a value of $\log D_{\rm mix}$ between 1.75 and
2.00 dex (with $D_{\rm mix}$ in cm^2/sec) improves the goodness-of-fit based on
the observed and modelled frequencies with a factor 11 compared to the case
where no extra mixing is considered, irrespective of the $(M,Z)$ combination
within the allowed seismic range. The inclusion of diffusive mixing in addition
to core overshooting is essential to explain the structure in the observed
period spacing pattern of this star. Moreover, we deduce that an exponentially
decaying prescription for the core overshooting is to be preferred over a step
function. Our best models for KIC 10526294 approach the seismic data to a level
that they can serve future inversion of its stellar structure.

Here it is shown that there exists a measurement scheme that is exactly
decohering without the aid of an environment. The scheme relies on the
assumption that the meter is decomposable into probe and pointer, with the
probe taken to be inaccessible for observation. Under the assumption that the
probe and the pointer initial states are momentum limited, it is shown that
coherences die out within a finite interval of time and the pointer states are
exactly orthogonal. These lead to the fundamental realization that dispersion
of correlation does not require an external infinite number of degrees of

the correlations and leave its subparts in a classical mixed state, so that

the inflaton is a matter field (which can be charged under gauge symmetries)
and inflation ends by a GUT-scale phase transition of a waterfall field. These
features make tribrid inflation a promising framework for realising inflation
with particularly close connections to particle physics. Superpotentials of
tribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,
which is often taken as the Planck scale. However, these operators may also be
generated by integrating out messenger superfields with masses below the Planck
scale, which is in fact quite common in GUT and/or flavour models. The values
of the inflaton field during inflation can then lie above this mass scale,
which means that for reliably calculating the model predictions one has to go
beyond the effective theory description. We therefore discuss realisations of
effective theories of tribrid inflation and specify in which cases effects from
the messenger fields are expected, and under which conditions they can safely
be neglected. In particular, we point out how to construct realisations where,
despite the fact that the inflaton field values are above the messenger mass
scale, the predictions for the observables are (to a good approximation)
identical to the ones calculated in the effective theory treatment where the
messenger mass scale is identified with the (apparent) cutoff scale.

the core region to search for the signature of cold gas, and constrain the mass
deposition rate in the cooling flow which is thought to be responsible of the
massive star formation episode observed in the BCG. We find an average mass
deposition rate of $\dot M = 620 (-190 +200)_{stat} (-50 +150)_{syst}
M_\odot$/yr in the temperature range 0.3-3.0 keV from MOS data. A
temperature-resolved analysis shows that a significant amount of gas is
deposited only above 1.8 keV, while upper limits of the order of hundreds of
$M_\odot$/yr can be put in the 0.3-1.8 keV temperature range. From pn data we
obtain $\dot M = 210 (-80 +85)_{stat} ( -35 +60)_{syst} M_\odot$/yr, and the
upper limits from the temperature-resolved analysis are typically a factor of 3
lower than MOS data. In the RGS spectrum, no line emission from ionization
states below Fe XXIII is seen above $12 \AA$, and the amount of gas cooling
below $\sim 3$ keV has a best-fit value $\dot M = 122_{-122}^{+343}$
$M_{\odot}$/yr. In addition, our analysis of the FIR SED of the BCG based on
Herschel data provides $SFR = (530 \pm 50) M_\odot$/yr, significantly lower
than previous estimates by a factor 1.5. Current data are able to firmly
identify substantial amount of cooling gas only above 1.8 keV in the core of
the Phoenix cluster. While MOS data analysis is consistent with values as high
as $\dot M \sim 1000$ within $1 \sigma$, pn data provide $\dot M < 500 M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ c.l. at temperature below 1.8 keV. At present, this

this report, we compare S=1 and S=3/2 spins, and discuss how one can apply
general principles for the use of high spin systems as a vector magnetometer to
the S=3/2 spin systems. We find analytical solutions which allow a
reconstruction of the magnetic field strength and polar angle using the
observed resonance transitions if an uniaxial symmetry exists for the spin-spin
interaction as in S=1 systems. We also find that an ambiguity of determining
the field parameters may arise due to the unique properties of S=3/2 systems,
and present solutions for it utilizing additional transitions in the low-field
region. The electronic spins of the silicon vacancy in silicon carbide will be
introduced as a model for the S=3/2 DC vector magnetometer and the practical

by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main
challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each
sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Due to the large volume of
metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that
can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard
alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional
approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it
contains have the potential to provide faster solutions. In this work, we
investigate the potential of modern, large-scale machine learning
implementations for taxonomic affectation of next-generation sequencing reads
based on their k-mers profile. We show that machine learning-based
compositional approaches benefit from increasing the number of fragments
sampled from reference genome to tune their parameters, up to a coverage of
about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning these models
involves training a machine learning model on about 10 8 samples in 10 7
dimensions, which is out of reach of standard soft-wares but can be done
efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The
resulting models are competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established
alignment tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate
species, and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however,
that compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with
problems involving a greater number of species, and more sensitive to
sequencing errors. We finally confirm that compositional approach achieve
faster prediction times, with a gain of 3 to 15 times with respect to the
BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the
level of sequencing noise.

morphogenesis, growth, and cell differentiation. This cytokine is particularly
important in cartilage where it regulates cell proliferation and extracellular
matrix synthesis. While the action of TGF$\beta$ on chondrocyte metabolism has
been extensively catalogued, the modulation of specific genes that function as
mediators of TGF$\beta$ signalling is poorly defined. In the current study,
elements of the Smad component of the TGF$\beta$ intracellular signalling
system and TGF$\beta$ receptors were characterised in human chondrocytes upon
TGF$\beta$1 treatment. Human articular chondrocytes were incubated with
TGF$\beta$1. Then, mRNA and protein levels of TGF$\beta$ receptors and Smads
were analysed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The role of specific protein
1 (Sp1) was investigated by gain and loss of function (inhibitor, siRNA,
expression vector). We showed that TGF$\beta$1 regulates mRNA levels of its own
receptors, and of Smad3 and Smad7. It modulates TGF$\beta$ receptors
post-transcriptionally by affecting their mRNA stability, but does not change
the Smad-3 and Smad-7 mRNA half-life span, suggesting a potential
transcriptional effect on these genes. Moreover, the transcriptional factor
Sp1, which is downregulated by TGF$\beta$1, is involved in the repression of
both TGF$\beta$ receptors but not in the modulation of Smad3 and Smad7.
Interestingly, Sp1 ectopic expression permitted also to maintain a similar
expression pattern to early response to TGF$\beta$ at 24 hours of treatment. It
restored the induction of Sox9 and COL2A1 and blocked the late response
(repression of aggrecan, induction of COL1A1 and COL10A1). These data help to
better understand the negative feedback loop in the TGF$\beta$ signalling
system, and enlighten an interesting role of Sp1 to regulate TGF$\beta$
response.

transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Interleukin-1$\beta$ and tumor
necrosis factor-$\alpha$ downregulated ASPN, whereas transforming growth
factor-$\beta$1 (when incubated in a serum-free medium) upregulated it.
Similarly to proinflammatory cytokines, chondrocyte dedifferentiation induced
by a successive passages of cells was accompanied by a decreased asporin
expression, whereas their redifferentiation by three-dimensional culture
restored its expression. Finally, we found an important role of the
transcription factor Sp1 in the regulation of ASPN expression. Sp1 ectopic
expression increased ASPN mRNA level and promoter activity. In addition, using
gene reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we showed that
Sp1 mediated its effect through a region located between -473 and -140 bp
upstream of the transcription start site in ASPN gene. In conclusion, this
report is the first study on the regulation of asporin expression by different

considerable amount of the galaxy's luminosity is generated. This nucleus
contains a dusty environment that is rich in molecular gas. One approach to
probing this kind of environment and to revealing what is hidden behind the
dust is to study the rotational lines of molecules that couple well with the IR
radiation emitted by the dust. Methods. We observed Zw 049.057 with PACS and
SPIRE onboard the Herschel Space Observatory in rotational lines of H2O, H218O,
OH, 18OH, and [O I]. We modeled the unresolved core of the galaxy using a
spherically symmetric radiative transfer code. Results. We present the full
SPIRE FTS spectrum of Zw 049.057, along with relevant spectral scans in the
PACS range. We find that a minimum of two different components (nuclear and
extended) are required in order to account for the rich molecular line
spectrum. The nuclear component has a radius of 10-30 pc, a very high infrared
surface brightness (1e14 Lsun/kpc2), warm dust (Td > 100 K), and a very large
H2 column density (NH2 = 1e24-1e25 cm-2). The modeling also indicates high
nuclear H2O (5e-6) and OH (4e-6) abundances relative to H2 as well as a low
16O/18O-ratio of 50-100. We also find a prominent infall signature in the [O I]
line. We tentatively detect a 500 km/s outflow in the H2O 313->202 line.
Conclusions. The high surface brightness of the core indicates the presence of
either a buried active galactic nucleus or a very dense nuclear starburst.nThe

We discuss two classes of modes corresponding to density and spin perturbations
with energy spectra $\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha q^2$, where $\omega_0 =
2\Delta$ is the threshold frequency and $\Delta$ is the gap in the neutron
fluid spectrum. For characteristic values of Landau parameters in neutron star
crusts the exitonic density modes have $\alpha < 0$, therefore they live below
the pair-breaking continuum $\omega_0$ and are undamped. For spin diffusive
modes $\alpha > 0$ and they exist above $\omega_0$ which implies that these
modes are damped. As an application of these findings we compute the thermal
conductivity due to spin diffusive modes and show that it scales as $T^{1/2}
\exp(-2\omega_0/T)$ in the case where their two-by-two scattering cross-section
is weakly dependent on temperature.

plays an important part in shaping their organization. In this paper we study
network designs resulting from a Pareto optimization process, where different
simultaneous constraints are the targets of selection. We analyze three
variations on a problem finding phase transitions of different kinds. Distinct
phases are associated to different arrangements of the connections; but the
need of drastic topological changes does not determine the presence, nor the
nature of the phase transitions encountered. Instead, the functions under
optimization do play a determinant role. This reinforces the view that phase
transitions do not arise from intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from
the interplay of that system with its external constraints.

and contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies. This
comparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multiple
Herschel studies of early-type galaxies. A comparison between consistent
modified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out, revealing strong
differences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar mass
ratio. In particular, the HeViCS sample lacks massive ETG with as high a
specific dust content as found in H-ATLAS. This is most likely connected with
the difference in environment for the two samples. We calculate nearest
neighbour environment densities in a consistent way, showing that H-ATLAS ETG
occupy sparser regions of the local Universe, whereas HeViCS ETG occupy dense
regions. This is also true for ETG that are not Herschel-detected but are in
the Virgo and GAMA parent samples. Spectral energy distributions are fit to the
panchromatic data. From these we find that in H-ATLAS the specific star
formation rate anticorrelates with stellar mass and reaches values as high as
in our Galaxy. On the other hand HeViCS ETG appear to have little star
formation. Based on the trends found here, H-ATLAS ETG are thought to have more
extended star formation histories and a younger stellar population than HeViCS
ETG.

millions of light years and often showing superluminal motions organised in a
complex kinematic pattern. A number of physical models are still competing to
explain the jet structure and kinematics revealed by radio images using the
VLBI technique. Robust measurements of longitudinal and transverse velocity
field in the jets would provide crucial information for these models. This is a
difficult task, particularly for transversely resolved jets in objects like 3C
273 and M87. To address this task, we have developed a new technique for
identifying significant structural patterns (SSP) of smooth, transversely
resolved flows and obtaining a velocity field from cross-correlation of these
regions in multi-epoch observations. Detection of individual SSP is performed
using the wavelet decomposition and multiscale segmentation of the observed
structure. The cross-correlation algorithm combines structural information on
different scales of the wavelet decomposition, providing a robust and reliable
identification of related SSP in multi -epoch images. The algorithm enables
recovering structural evolution on scales down to 0.25 full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the image point spread function (PSF). We present here
examples of applying this algorithm to obtain the first detailed transverse
velocity fields and to study the kinematic evolution in the parsec-scale jets

progressively different depths. Gas-liquid coexistence curves are obtained by
predicting pressures, free energies, and chemical potentials. In comparison
with previous simulation results, RISM and OPT agree in reproducing the
progressive reduction of the gas-liquid phase separation as the anisotropy of
the interaction potential becomes more pronounced; in particular, the RISM
theory provides reasonable predictions for all coexistence curves, bar the
strong anisotropy regime, whereas OPT performs generally less well. Both
theories predict a linear dependence of the critical temperature on the
interaction strength, reproducing in this way the mean-field behavior observed

PLTL to be able to express all omega-regular properties.
  Here, we generalize PLTL to systems with costs, i.e., we do not bound the
scope of operators in time, but bound the scope in terms of the cost
accumulated during time. Again, we show that model checking and solving games

is derived using maximum entropy principle for various choices of entropy and
even beyond equilibrium. By the form invariance of thermodynamics, it is meant
that the form of the free energy (internal energy minus the temperature times
entropy) remains unaltered when all the entities entering this relation are
suitably defined. The useful ingredients for this are the equilibrium entropy
associated with thermal density matrix and the relative entropy between an
arbitrary density matrix and the thermal density matrix. To delineate the form
invariance, we consider the quantum R\'enyi entropic versions (indexed by a
parameter $\alpha$), i.e., R\'enyi entropy with appropriate internal energy and
equilibrium state defined for all $\alpha$. These results reduce to the
well-known Gibbs-von Neumann results when $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. Moreover, we
show that the \textit{universality} of the Carnot statement of the second law
is the consequence of the form invariance of the free energy. Further, the
Clausius inequality, which is the precursor to the Carnot cycle, is also shown
to hold based on the known data processing inequalities for the traditional and
the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies. Thus, we find the thermodynamics of

pseudo-inverse of the combinatorial Laplace operator of a graph $G=(V,E)$. We
reveal the intimate connection between Green's function and the theory of exact
stopping rules for random walks on graphs. We give an elementary formula for
Green's function in terms of state-to-state hitting times of the underlying
graph. Namely, $\mathbb{G}(i,j) = \pi_j \left( \sum_{k \in V} \pi_k H(k,j) -
H(i,j) \right)$ where $\pi_i$ is the stationary distribution at vertex $i$ and
$H(i,j)$ is the expected hitting time for a random walk starting from vertex
$i$ to first reach vertex $j$. This formula also holds for the digraph Laplace
operator.
  The most important characteristics of a stopping rule are its exit
frequencies, which are the expected number of exits of a given vertex before
the rule halts the walk. We show that Green's function is, in fact, a matrix of
exit frequencies plus a rank one matrix. In the undirected case, we derive
spectral formulas for Green's function and for some mixing measures arising
from stopping rules. Finally, we further explore the exit frequency matrix
point-of-view, and discuss a natural generalization of Green's function for any
distribution $\tau$ defined on the vertex set of the graph.

intersect near the Planck point $(l_P,m_P)$, where quantum gravity effects
become significant. Since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics is
based on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de Broglie
relations, these relations should break down near $(l_P,m_P)$. It is unclear
what physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energy $E
\gg m_Pc^2 $, since they correspond to wavelengths $\lambda \ll l_P$ or time
periods $T \ll t_P$ in the standard theory. We therefore propose a correction
to the standard de Broglie relations, which gives rise to a modified Schr{\""

may be extended into the region $E \gg m_Pc^2$. For the proposed modification,
we recover the expression for the Schwarzschild radius for $E \gg m_Pc^2$ and
the usual Compton formula for $E \ll m_Pc^2$. The sign of the inequality
obtained from the uncertainty principle reverses at $m \approx m_P$, so that
the Compton wavelength and event horizon size may be interpreted as minimum and
maximum radii, respectively. We interpret the additional terms in the modified
de Broglie relations as representing the self-gravitation of the wave packet.

subsequently interpret this behavior as a mutual intersite $f$-electron
coherence; a combined effect of both the hybridization and the Coulomb
repulsion. Such feature is absent on the level of GA which is equivalent to the
zeroth order of our expansion. Formation of the hybridization- and

Three phases are present: a metallic one, for small values of $U$, where both

orbital-selective Mott insulator (OSMI), for small values of $R$ and

$\Theta_{\rm BN}$ and $\Theta_{\rm DS}$, both exactly solvable. The relative
stability of these points, and the question of which one describes the
`generic' theta point, have been the source of a long-standing debate.
Moreover, the analytically predicted exponents of $\Theta_{\rm BN}$ have never
been convincingly observed in numerical simulations.
  In the present paper, we shed a new light on this confusing situation. We
show in particular that the continuum limit of $\Theta_{\rm BN}$ is an unusual
conformal field theory, made in fact of a simple dense polymer decorated with
{\sl non-compact degrees of freedom}. This implies in particular that the
critical exponents take continuous rather than discrete values, and that
corrections to scaling lead to an unusual integral form. Furthermore, discrete
states may emerge from the continuum, but the latter are only
normalizable---and hence observable---for appropriate values of the model's
parameters. We check these findings numerically. We also probe the non-compact
degrees of freedom in various ways, and establish that they are related to
fluctuations of the density of monomers. Finally, we construct a field
theoretic model of the vicinity of $\Theta_{\rm BN}$ and examine the flow along
the multicritical line between $\Theta_{\rm BN}$ and $\Theta_{\rm DS}$.

protection against backscattering. However, the contribution of bulk electrons
to the transport data is an impediment to the topological protection of
surface. We report the tuning of the chemical potential in the bulk of Bi2Se2Te
TI thin films, pinning it near the center of the bulk band gap, thereby
suppressing the bulk carriers. The temperature dependent resistance of these
films shows activated behavior down to 50K, followed by a metallic transition
at lower temperatures, a hallmark of the robustness of TI surface states.
Manifestation of topological protection and surface dominated transport is
explained by 2D weak antilocalization phenomenon. We further explore the effect
of surface to bulk coupling in TI in this work, which is captured by the number
of effective conducting surface channels that participate in the transport. The
presence of a single conducting channel indicates a strong surface to bulk
coupling which is detrimental to purely topological transport. We demonstrate
the decoupling of topological surface states on opposite surfaces of thin

and shape with time. To understand the mechanism of development of age spots,
characteristics of age spots are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism
introduced in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. An age spot is
pathologically a group of aggregated basal cells, which contain lipofuscin
bodies. Accumulation of lipofuscin bodies is a sign of aging of a cell.
Characteristics of age spots include: inhomogeneity in distribution, growing
flatly before becoming protruding, irregularity on shape, inhomogeneity on the
color and on the protruding degree of a spot, and softness of a protruding
spot. After analyzing these characteristics, we make a hypothesis on the
process of development of an age spot. A. Aging of a tissue is the basis for
development of age spots. B. A flat spot results from accumulation of
lipofuscin containing cells. When an aged cell remains, this cell can
accelerate the aging of its neighbor cells by increasing damage sensitivity and
reducing repair efficiency of the local tissue. By a viscous circle, more and
more neighbor cells become aged and they form a flat spot, which has an
irregular shape. C. A protruding spot develops when some of the cells in a flat
spot die and release lipofuscin bodies. For the survival of an organism, the un
degradable lipofuscin bodies have to be isolated by a capsule made by fibrotic
membrane, for maintaining the structural integrity of local epidermis.
Successive deaths of lipofuscin containing cells make the capsule include more
and more dead substances by layers of fibrotic membrane. In this way, the spot
""grows"" in three-dimension, resulting in protruding of the spot. In conclusion,
development of an age spot is a result of accumulation of aged cells in aged
skin.

remnants (SNRs), we estimate the values of the mean braking indices of eight
magnetars with SNRs, and find that they cluster in a range of $1\sim$42. Five
magnetars have smaller mean braking indices of $1<n<3$, and we interpret them
within a combination of magneto-dipole radiation and wind aided braking, while
the larger mean braking indices of $n>3$ for other three magnetars are
attributed to the decay of external braking torque, which might be caused by
magnetic field decay. We estimate the possible wind luminosities for the
magnetars with $1<n<3$, and the dipolar magnetic field decay rates for the
magnetars with $n>3$ within the updated magneto-thermal evolution models.
Although the constrained range of the magnetars' braking indices is tentative,
due to the uncertainties in the SNR ages, which come from distance
uncertainties and the unknown conditions of the expanding shells, our method
provides an effective way to constrain the magnetars' braking indices if the
measurements of the SNRs' ages are reliable, which can be improved by future
observations.

phenomena. With a new concept of Misrepair, this theory reaches a unified
understanding of aging: aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of
Misrepairs of its structure. Misrepair accumulation theory (MA theory) is
distinct and it can improve our understanding of life on several aspects. I. MA
theory is fundamentally different from other theories by: A. proposing a
generalized concept of Misrepair; B. pointing out the evolutionary advantage of
aging mechanism; and C. distinguishing between aging of a cell and aging of a
tissue. II. MA theory overcomes the limitations of traditional theories on
interpreting the phenomena of tissue fibrosis and cancer development. Tissue
fibrosis, as a result of accumulation of Misrepairs with collagen fibers, is a
powerful evidence for demonstrating the central role of Misrepairs in aging.
Cancer development is a result of accumulation of DNA Misrepairs in somatic
cells, which needs to proceed over many generations of cells in a regenerable
tissue. III. MA theory improves also our understanding on longevity, premature
aging, adaptation, and species evolution. The potential of longevity of an
organism is hidden in the complexity of its structure. IV. MA theory suggests
that for retarding aging, the most important is to reduce the opportunity of
damage-exposure.

source, traversing a collapsing dust cloud and finally being received by an
asymptotic observer. In addition, we study the shadow that the collapsing cloud
casts on the sky of the asymptotic observer. We find that the resulting
redshift and properties of the shadow depend crucially on whether the final
outcome of the complete gravitational collapse is a black hole or a naked
singularity. In the black hole case, the shadow is due to the high redshift
acquired by the photons as they approach the event horizon, implying that their
energy is gradually redshifted toward zero within a few crossing times
associated with the event horizon radius. In contrast to this, a naked
singularity not only absorbs photons originating from the source, but it also
emits infinitely redshifted photons with and without angular momenta. This
emission introduces an abrupt cutoff in the frequency shift of the photons
detected in directions close to the radial one, and it is responsible for the
shadow masking the source in the naked singularity case. Furthermore, even
though the shadow forms and begins to grow immediately after the observer
crosses the Cauchy horizon, it takes many more crossing times than in the black
hole case for the source to be occulted from the observer's eyes. We discuss
possible implications of our results for testing the weak cosmic censorship
hypothesis. Even though at late times the image of the source perceived by the
observer looks the same in both cases, the dynamical formation of the shadow
and the redshift images has distinct features and time scales in the black hole
versus the naked singularity case. For stellar collapse, these time scales seem
to be too short to be resolved with existing technology. However, our results
may be relevant for the collapse of seeds leading to supermassive black holes.

response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as
well as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our
analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of

is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are
consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline

solar system by exploring comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at close range. In
this paper we discuss the origin and evolution of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in relation to that of comets in general and in the
framework of current solar system formation models. We use data from the OSIRIS
scientific cameras as basic constraints. In particular, we discuss the overall
bi-lobate shape and the presence of key geological features, such as layers and
fractures. We also treat the problem of collisional evolution of comet nuclei
by a particle-in-a-box calculation for an estimate of the probability of
survival for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the early epochs of the solar
system. We argue that the two lobes of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus
are derived from two distinct objects that have formed a contact binary via a
gentle merger. The lobes are separate bodies, though sufficiently similar to
have formed in the same environment. An estimate of the collisional rate in the
primordial, trans-planetary disk shows that most comets of similar size to
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are likely collisional fragments, although survival
of primordial planetesimals cannot be excluded. A collisional origin of the
contact binary is suggested, and the low bulk density of the aggregate and
abundance of volatile species show that a very gentle merger must have
occurred. We thus consider two main scenarios: the primordial accretion of
planetesimals, and the re-accretion of fragments after an energetic impact onto
a larger parent body. We point to the primordial signatures exhibited by
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and other comet nuclei as critical tests of the
collisional evolution.

  Following the usual toric paradigm, normal formal monoid schemes can be
classified in terms of certain cone complexes, and their properties understood

the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs admit a continuum

study the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs, and show that it leads to an
entire class of PDEs, encompassing the Hamiltonian form of the massive Dirac

explicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of a test particle in

have introduced two novel ingredients for taking the continuum limit of a QW,
but which apply to any quantum cellular automata: encoding and grouping.

are observed for both samples at low temperatures for magnetic fields not only
above $H_{c1}$, but in fields lower than $H_{c1}$ in the vortex-free region.
The positions of the jumps are not reproducible and they change from one

planar Nb film in the parallel field geometry does not exhibit jumps in the
entire range of accessible temperatures. The ac response was measured in
constant and swept dc magnetic field modes. Experiment shows that ac losses at
low magnetic fields in a swept field mode are smaller for the patterned sample.
For both samples the shapes of the field dependences of losses and the
amplitude of the third harmonic are the same in constant and swept field near
$H_{c3}$. This similarity does not exist at low fields in a swept mode.

leads to several intriguing features both in general relativity and in
Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. Recently in arXiv:1312.3253 several
additional results strengthening the above connection have been established
within the framework of general relativity. In this work we provide a
generalization of the above setup to Lanczos-Lovelock gravity as well. To our
expectation it turns out that most of the results obtained in the context of
general relativity generalize to Lanczos-Lovelock gravity in a straightforward
but non-trivial manner.
  Another very interesting feature for gravity is that gravitational field
equations for arbitrary static and spherically symmetric spacetimes with
horizon can be written as a thermodynamic identity in the near horizon limit.
This result holds in both general relativity and in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity as
well. In a previous work [arXiv:1505.05297] we have shown that, for an
arbitrary spacetime, the gravitational field equations near any null surface
generically leads to a thermodynamic identity. In this work, we have also
generalized this result to Lanczos-Lovelock gravity by showing that
gravitational field equations for Lanczos-Lovelock gravity near an arbitrary
null surface can be written as a thermodynamic identity. By taking appropriate

using a recently developed projection method which provides a unified numerical
framework to compute the free energy of periodic crystal and quasicrystals.
Accurate free energies of numerous ordered phases, including dodecagonal,
decagonal and octagonal quasicrystals, are obtained for a simple model, i.e.
the Lifshitz-Petrich free energy functional, of soft quasicrystals with two
length-scales. The availability of the free energy allows us to construct phase
diagrams of the system, demonstrating that, for the Lifshitz-Petrich model, the
dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystals can become stable phases, whereas the
octagonal quasicrystal stays as a metastable phase.

a flume where an analogue White Hole horizon is generated, in the form of a
wave blocking region, by suitably tuned uniform fluid (water) flow and
counter-propagating shallow water waves. We corroborate earlier experimental
observations by finding a critical wave frequency for a particular discharge
above which the waves are effectively blocked beyond the horizon. An obstacle,
in the form of a bottom wave, is introduced to generate a sharp blocking zone.
All previous researchers used this obstacle.
  A novel part of our experiment is where we do not introduce the obstacle and
find that wave blocking still takes place, albeit in a more diffused zone.
Lastly we replace the fixed bottom wave obstacle by a movable sand bed to study
the sediment transport and the impact of the horizon or wave blocking
phenomenon on the sediment profile. We find signatures of the wave blocking
zone in the ripple pattern.

in the signal processing and related fields: the estimation of the geometric
mean of a set of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and their
approximate joint diagonalization (AJD). Today there is a considerable interest
in estimating the geometric mean of a SPD matrix set in the manifold of SPD
matrices endowed with the Fisher information metric. The resulting mean has
several important invariance properties and has proven very useful in diverse
engineering applications such as biomedical and image data processing. While
for two SPD matrices the mean has an algebraic closed form solution, for a set
of more than two SPD matrices it can only be estimated by iterative algorithms.
However, none of the existing iterative algorithms feature at the same time
fast convergence, low computational complexity per iteration and guarantee of
convergence. For this reason, recently other definitions of geometric mean
based on symmetric divergence measures, such as the Bhattacharyya divergence,
have been considered. The resulting means, although possibly useful in
practice, do not satisfy all desirable invariance properties. In this paper we
consider geometric means of co-variance matrices estimated on high-dimensional
time-series, assuming that the data is generated according to an instantaneous
mixing model, which is very common in signal processing. We show that in these
circumstances we can approximate the Fisher information geometric mean by
employing an efficient AJD algorithm. Our approximation is in general much
closer to the Fisher information geometric mean as compared to its competitors
and verifies many invariance properties. Furthermore, convergence is
guaranteed, the computational complexity is low and the convergence rate is
quadratic. The accuracy of this new geometric mean approximation is
demonstrated by means of simulations.

both the parameters of the stellar system (stellar separation and eccentricity)
and the architecture of the planetary system (number of planets and their
orbital behaviour). In case a terrestrial planet moves in the so-called
habitable zone (HZ) of its host star, the habitability of this planet depends
on many parameters. A crucial factor is certainly the amount of water. We
investigate in this work the transport of water from beyond the snow-line to
the HZ in a binary star system and compare it to a single star system.

integrals, rely on random walks on graphs that can be represented as Markov
chains. Traditionally, estimates of running times of such sampling algorithms
are computed using the number of steps in the chain needed to reach the
stationary distribution. This quantity is generally defined as mixing time and
is often difficult to compute. In this paper, we suggest an alternative
estimate based on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, by establishing a link between
the maximization of KSE and the minimization of the mixing time. Since KSE are
easier to compute in general than mixing time, this link provides a new faster
method to approximate the minimum mixing time that could be interesting in
computer sciences and statistical physics. Beyond this, our finding will also
be of interest to the out-of-equilibrium community, by providing a new rational
to select stationary states in out-of-equilibrium physics: it seems reasonable
that in a physical system with two simultaneous equiprobable possible dynamics,
the final stationary state will be closer to the stationary state corresponding
to the fastest dynamics (smallest mixing time).Through the empirical link found
in this letter, this state will correspond to a state of maximal
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. If this is true, this would provide a more satisfying
rule for selecting stationary states in complex systems such as climate than
the maximization of the entropy production.

implementing a new procurement rule proposed by Chen and Micali [2012] that is
robust to collusion and always guarantees the efficient outcome. The rule
requires bidders to report their coalition and to ensure
incentive-compatibility, the mechanism allows them to attain rents. We estimate
this rent using data from California highway construction and find it to be
anywhere between 1.6% to 5%. Even after we factor in the marginal excess burden
