due to their exotic electronic properties along with high specific surface
area. The prospects of exploiting these properties in sensing, catalysis,
energy storage, protective coatings and electrochromism have witnessed a
paradigm shift towards the exploration of these sophisticated 2D materials. The
exemplary performance of graphene (1) which is among the first of these
elemental 2D materials have initiated a runaway effect in the pursuit of
studying alternative 2D materials. Even though graphene has tunable exotic
electronic properties (2), the spin-orbit (SO) coupling is weak (3) limiting
its applications as spin filters, topological insulators etc. Topological
insulators by their very nature force the electrons to travel on the surface at
very high speeds thereby finding useful applications in electronic and photonic
devices. Exploration of group IV elements using first principles calculations
have revealed that the SO coupling increases as the atomic weight of the basis
atoms in the honeycomb lattice (4). Tin is one of the heaviest elements in this
series having strong spin-orbit coupling making it a promising applicant for
room temperature topological insulator. Thus there is an urgent need to
discover novel 2D materials in the post graphene age to overcome its
deficiencies. We have synthesized and investigated the optical transitions in
2D material referred to as few-layer stanene (FLS). These are analogous to
few-layer graphene and can be visualized by replacing carbon atoms by tin on a
graphene lattice. We have been able to synthesize from mono to few atomic
layers of free standing stanene and characterize them optically using UV-Vis
absorption, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. First principles

functions must satisfy to properly define frontiers of non-dominated solutions

the objective space, thus being agnostic about how the solutions are evaluated.
Therefore, real objectives or user-designed objectives' surrogates are allowed,
opening the possibility of linking independent objective surrogates. To
illustrate the practical consequences of adopting the proposed conditions, we
use Gaussian processes as surrogates endowed with monotonicity soft constraints
and with an adjustable degree of flexibility, and compare them to regular
Gaussian processes and to a frontier surrogate method in the literature that is
the closest to the method proposed in this paper. Results show that the
necessary and sufficient conditions proposed here are finely managed by the
constrained Gaussian process, guiding to high-quality surrogates capable of
suitably synthesizing an approximation to the Pareto frontier in challenging
instances of multi-objective optimization, while an existing approach that does
not take the theory proposed in consideration defines surrogates which greatly
violate the conditions to describe a valid frontier.

has been shown recently that for many problems, one can basically remove the
assumption about the knowledge of $n$, without increasing the asymptotic
running time. In this case, it is assumed that different vertices can choose
their final output at different rounds, but continue to transmit messages. In

spacetime to $d+1=2$, at high energies (ultraviolet limit), which is confirmed
by other quantum gravity approaches, as well as to $d+1=4$, at low energies
(infrared limit). This is obtained by computing the free energy of massless
scalar and gauge fields. We find that the only effect of the background is to
change the proportionality constant between the internal energy and
temperature. Firstly, we consider both the non-perturbative and perturbative
models involving the matter action, without gravitational sources but with
manifest time and space symmetry breaking, in order to calculate modifications
in the Stephan-Boltzmann law. When gravity is taken into account, we assume a
scenario in which there is a spherical source with mass $M$ and radius $R$ in
thermal equilibrium with radiation, and consider the static and spherically
symmetric solution of the H-L theory found by Kehagias-Sfetsos (K-S), in the
weak and strong field approximations. As byproducts, for the weak field regime,
we used the current uncertainty of the solar radiance measurements to establish
a constraint on the $\omega$ free parameter of the K-S solution. We also
calculate the corrections, due to gravity, to the recently predicted attractive
force that black bodies exert on nearby neutral atoms and molecules.

flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can
use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and
execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language
and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log
probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among
variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate
with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows
specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as
creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The
second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the
first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles
models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and
provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language
represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This
paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with
illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).

observed at the northern component of Abell 1758, comprised of two massive
sub-clusters separated by approximately 750 kpc. One of the clusters exhibits
an offset between the dark matter and the intracluster gas. We aim to determine
whether it is possible to reproduce the specific morphological features of this
cluster by means of a major merger. We perform dedicated SPH (smoothed particle
hydrodynamics) N-body simulations in an attempt to simultaneously recover
several observed features of Abell 1758, such as the X-ray morphology and the
separation between the two peaks in the projected galaxy luminosity map. We
propose a specific scenario for the off-axis collision of two massive clusters.
This model adequately reproduces several observed features and suggests that
Abell 1758 is seen approximately 0.4 Gyr after the first pericentric passage,
and that the clusters are already approaching their maximum separation. This
means that their relative velocity is as low as 380 km/s. At the same time, the
simulated model entails shock waves of ~4500 km/s, which are currently
undetected presumably due to the low-density medium. We explain the difference
between these velocities and argue that the predicted shock fronts, while
plausible, cannot be detected from currently available data.

Coulomb string tension in SU(3) gauge theory is about a factor of four times
greater than the asymptotic string tension. In our approach we show that a
single constituent gluon is in principle sufficient, up to 2.4 fm, to reduce
this overshoot by the factor required. The static potential remains linear,
although the precise value of the string tension depends on details of the
Couloumb gauge ghost and gluon propagators in the infrared regime. In this
connection we present new lattice results for the transverse gluon propagator
in position space.

is delayed by $\sim$100 ms in 3D relative to the 2D counterpart and the growth
of the diagnostic explosion energy is slower. This is consistent with
previously reported 3D simulations utilizing iron-core progenitors with dense
mantles. In the $\sim$100 ms before the onset of explosion, diagnostics of
neutrino heating and turbulent kinetic energy favor earlier explosion in 2D.
During the delay, the angular scale of convective plumes reaching the shock
surface grows and explosion in 3D is ultimately lead by a single, large-angle
plume, giving the expanding shock a directional orientation not dissimilar from
those imposed by axial symmetry in 2D simulations. We posit that shock revival
and explosion in the 3D simulation may be delayed until sufficiently large
plumes form, whereas such plumes form more rapidly in 2D, permitting earlier
explosions.

distinguishing features, most notably, a distinct objective functional and
novel update rules, which operate in an adaptive fashion and drop terms bearing
too much influence on the search direction. These careful selection rules
provide a tighter initial guess, better descent directions, and thus enhanced
practical performance. On the theoretical side, we prove that for certain

the palaeodiet structure suggested by archaeological data, stable isotope
analyses of human remains, and palynology. We allow for the archeologically
attested contributions of domesticated and wild animal products to the diet,
develop plausible estimates of the yield of ancient cereal varieties cultivated
with ancient techniques, and quantify the yield dependence on the time after
initial planting and on rainfall (as a climate proxy). Our conclusions involve
analysis of the labour costs of the agricultural cycle of both an individual
and a farmer's family. Finally, we put our results into the context of the
exploitation territory and catchment analysis. The simplest economic complex
based on cereals, domestic and wild animal products, with fallow cropping,
appears to be capable of supporting an isolated, relatively small farming
community of 50-300 people (2-10 ha). Our results strongly suggest that dairy
products played a significant role in the dietary and labour balance. The
smaller settlements are typical of the earliest Trypillia A but remain
predominant at the later stages. A larger settlement of several hundred people
could function in isolation only with technological innovations, such as manure
fertiliser and ard tillage. Very large settlements of a few hundred hectares
could function only if supported by satellite farming villages and stable
exchange networks. We also discuss, quantify and assess some strategies to
mitigate the risks of arable agriculture associated with strong temporal
fluctuations in the cereal yield, such as manure fertilisation, increased
fraction of cereals in the diet combined with producing grain surplus for

deterministic linear codes achieves capacity on an erasure channel under
maximum a posteriori decoding. Rather than relying on the precise structure of
the codes, this method requires only that the codes are highly symmetric. In
particular, the technique applies to any sequence of linear codes where the
blocklengths are strictly increasing, the code rates converge to a number
between 0 and 1, and the permutation group of each code is doubly transitive.
This also provides a rare example in information theory where symmetry alone
implies near-optimal performance.
  An important consequence of this result is that a sequence of Reed-Muller
codes with increasing blocklength achieves capacity if its code rate converges
to a number between 0 and 1. This possibility has been suggested previously in
the literature but it has only been proven for cases where the limiting code
rate is 0 or 1. Moreover, these results extend naturally to affine-invariant
codes and, thus, to all extended primitive narrow-sense BCH codes. The primary
tools used in the proof are the sharp threshold property for monotone boolean
functions and the area theorem for extrinsic information transfer functions.

codes with a (usually small) fixed set of helper nodes participating in repair.
Since most existing LRCs assume exact repair and allow full exchange of the
stored data ($\beta=\alpha$) from the helper nodes, they can be viewed as a
generalization of the traditional erasure codes (ECs) with a much desired
feature of local repairability via predetermined sets of helpers. However, it
also means that they lack the features of (i) functional repair, and (ii)
partial information-exchange ($\beta<\alpha$) in the original regenerating
codes (RCs), which could further reduce the repair bandwidth. Motivated by the
significant bandwidth reduction of RCs over ECs, existing works by Ahmad et al
and by Hollmann studied the concept of ""locally repairable regenerating codes
(LRRCs)"" that successfully combine functional repair and partial information
exchange of regenerating codes with the much-desired local repairability
feature of LRC. The resulting LRRCs demonstrate significant bandwidth
reduction.
  One important issue that needs to be addressed by any local repair schemes
(including both LRCs and LRRCs) is that sometimes designated helper nodes may
be temporarily unavailable, the result of multiple failures, degraded reads, or
other network dynamics. Under the setting of LRRCs with temporary node
unavailability, this work studies the impact of different helper selection
methods. It proves that with node unavailability, all existing methods of
helper selection, including those used in RCs and LRCs, can be insufficient in
terms of achieving the optimal repair-bandwidth. For some scenarios, it is
necessary to combine LRRCs with a new helper selection method, termed dynamic
helper selection, to achieve optimal repair bandwidth. This work also compares
the performance of different helper selection methods and answers...

worldwide, and infection of children in underdeveloped countries often leads to
high mortality rates. Isolated ETEC express a plethora of colonization factors
(fimbriae/pili), of which CFA/I and CFA/II that are assembled via the alternate
chaperone pathway (ACP), are amongst the most common. Fimbriae are filamentous
structures, whose shafts are primarily composed of helically arranged single
pilin-protein subunits, with a unique biomechanical capability allowing them to
unwind and rewind. A sustained ETEC infection, under adverse conditions of
dynamic shear forces, is primarily attributed to this biomechanical feature of
ETEC fimbriae. Recent understandings about the role of fimbriae as virulence
factors are pointing to an evolutionary adaptation of their structural and
biomechanical features. In this work, we investigated the biophysical
properties of CS2 fimbriae from the CFA/II group. Homology modelling its major
structural subunit CotA reveals structural clues and these are related to the
niche in which they are expressed. Using optical tweezers force spectroscopy we
found that CS2 fimbriae unwind at a constant force of 10 pN and have a corner
velocity of 1300 nm/s, i.e., the velocity at which the force required for
unwinding rises exponentially with increased speed. The biophysical properties
of CS2 fimbriae assessed in this work classify them into a low-force unwinding
group of fimbriae together with the CFA/I and CS20 fimbriae expressed by ETEC
strains. The three fimbriae are expressed by ETEC, colonize in similar gut
environments, and exhibit similar biophysical features, but differ in their
biogenesis. Our observation suggests that the environment has a strong impact
on the biophysical characteristics of fimbriae expressed by ETEC.

Dirac cone surface state. The second description is accessed via an
electric-magnetic duality of the bulk TI coupled to a gauge field, which maps
it to a gauged topological superconductor. This alternate description
ultimately leads to a new surface theory - dual QED3. The dual theory provides
an explicit derivation of the T-Pfaffian state, a proposed surface topological
order of the TI, which is simply the paired superfluid state of the dual

temperature T2 = 13030 +/- 70 +/- 150 K and a surface gravity log g2 = 8.73 +/-
0.05 +/- 0.05 (statistical and systematic uncertainties respectively), leading
to a mass of M2 = 1.06 Msun. The temperature of the extremely low-mass white

surface gravity is poorly constrained by the data. The relative flux
contribution of the two white dwarfs across the spectrum provides a radius
ratio of R1/R2 = 4.2, which, together with evolutionary models, allows us to
calculate the cooling ages. The secondary massive white dwarf has a cooling age
of about 1 Gyr, while that of the primary low-mass white dwarf is likely to be
much longer, possibly larger than 5 Gyrs, depending on its mass and the

synthetic spectra generated from the models using syn++. The CaNIR feature is
better explained by the supernova model interacting with a shell than the model
without a shell, with a shell of mass 0.005 solar masses tending to be better
fitting than the other shells. The evolution of the optical depth of CaNIR
suggests that the ionization state of calcium within the ejecta and shell is
not constant. We discuss the method used to measure the observed velocity of

falsely identified. We briefly discuss the possible origin of the shells and
the implications for the progenitor system of the supernova.

coupled to the two metrics of bigravity and are linked together by an internal
vector field. We show that this model successfully reproduces the phenomenology
of dark matter at galactic scales (MOND) as a result of a mechanism of
gravitational polarisation. The model is safe in the gravitational sector, but
because of the particular couplings of the matter fields and vector field to
the metrics, a ghost in the decoupling limit is present in the dark matter
sector. However, it might be possible to push the mass of the ghost beyond the
strong coupling scale by an appropriate choice of the parameters of the model.

caused by the high external hydrostatic pressure for the interstellar medium

width optical emission lines, the sample, dubbed ""Green Peas,"" make some of the
best analogs for young galaxies in an early Universe. We detect Ly$\alpha$
emission in all ten galaxies, and 9/10 show double-peaked line profiles
suggestive of low HI column density. We measure Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux
ratios of 0.5-5.6, implying that 5% to 60% of Ly$\alpha$ photons escape the
galaxies. These data confirm previous findings that low-ionization metal
absorption (LIS) lines are weaker when Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and
equivalent width are higher. However, contrary to previously favored
interpretations of this trend, increased Ly$\alpha$ output cannot be the result
of varying HI covering: the Lyman absorption lines (Ly$\beta$ and higher) show
a covering fraction near unity for gas with $N_{HI} \gtrsim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$.
Moreover, we detect no correlation between Ly$\alpha$ escape and the outflow
velocity of the LIS lines, suggesting that kinematic effects do not explain the
range of Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratios in these galaxies. In contrast, we
detect a strong anti-correlation between the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and the
velocity separation of the Ly$\alpha$ emission peaks, driven primarily by the
velocity of the blue peak. As this velocity separation is sensitive to HI
column density, we conclude that Ly$\alpha$ escape in these Green Peas is
likely regulated by the HI column density rather than outflow velocity or HI
covering fraction.

and are representative of the brightest sources in the field (median SCUBA2
flux S_850=8.7+/-0.4 mJy). We detect 52 sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) at
>4-sigma significance in our 30 ALMA maps. In 61+/-17% of the ALMA maps the
single-dish source comprises a blend of >=2 SMGs, where the secondary SMGs are
Ultra--Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) with L_IR>10^12 Lo. The brightest
SMG contributes on average 80+/-4% of the single-dish flux density, and in the
ALMA maps containing >=2 SMGs the secondary SMG contributes 25+/-3% of the
integrated ALMA flux. We construct source counts and show that multiplicity
boosts the apparent single-dish cumulative counts by 20% at S_870>7.5mJy, and
by 60% at S_870>12mJy. We combine our sample with previous ALMA studies of
fainter SMGs and show that the counts are well-described by a double power-law
with a break at 8.5+/-0.6mJy. The break corresponds to a luminosity of
~6x10^12Lsol or a star-formation rate of ~1000Mo/yr. For the typical sizes of
these SMGs, which are resolved in our ALMA data with r=1.2+/-0.1kpc, this
yields a limiting SFR density of ~100Msol/yr/kpc2. Finally, the number density
of S_870>2mJy SMGs is 80+/-30 times higher than that derived from blank-field
counts. An over-abundance of faint SMGs is inconsistent with line-of-sight
projections dominating multiplicity in the brightest SMGs, and indicates that a
significant proportion of these high-redshift ULIRGs must be physically
associated.

renormalization of the Fermi velocity, effective coupling, and quasiparticle

leads to the emergence of a critical coupling above which the interaction
strength grows with decreasing energy scale. In addition, we identify a range
of coupling strengths below the critical point in which the Fermi velocity
varies non-monotonically as the low-energy, non-interacting fixed point is
approached. Furthermore, we find that while the higher-order correction to the
flow of the coupling is generally small compared to the leading order, the
corresponding correction to the velocity flow carries an additional factor of
the Dirac cone flavor number (the multiplicity of electron species, e.g.
ground-state valley degeneracy arising from the band structure) relative to the

find that, for the expected range of masses and radii and for realistic

equal to the union of the states of its parts, located in different regions of
space. Spekkens has argued that it is trivial to reproduce the predictions of
quantum mechanics using a separable ontological model, provided one allows for
arbitrary violations of `dynamical locality'. However, since dynamical locality
is strictly weaker than local causality, this leaves open the question of
whether an ontological model for quantum mechanics can be both separable and
dynamically local. We answer this question in the affirmative, using an
ontological model based on previous work by Deutsch and Hayden. Although the
original formulation of the model avoids Bell's theorem by denying that
measurements result in single, definite outcomes, we show that the model can
alternatively be cast in the framework of ontological models, where Bell's
theorem does apply. We find that the resulting model violates local causality,
but satisfies both separability and dynamical locality, making it a candidate
for the `most local' ontological model of quantum mechanics.

that might be revealing the shape of the new physics to come. In order to
understand the experimental data, we explore symmetry arguments that lead to
the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation. In particular, under the assumption
of negligible neutrino mass effects in charged lepton processes, the presence
of lepton universality violation without lepton flavor violation naturally
arises. This can account for a deficit of $B^+\to K^+\mu\mu$ over $B^+\to
K^+ee$ decays with new physics coupled predominantly to muons and a new physics
scale of a few TeV. A prediction of this scenario is the modification of
processes involving the third generation. In particular, accounting for the
above ratio implies a large enhancement, by a factor $\sim10^3$ with respect to
the standard model, of all the $b\to s\tau\tau$ decay rates. Although these are
still below current experimental limits, they should be easily at reach in
future experiments at $B$-factories. Another important consequence is the
prediction of sizable effects in charge-current $B$ tauonic decays which could
also explain the enhancements that have been observed in the $B\to
D^{(*)}\tau\bar \nu$ and $B^-\to\tau^-\bar \nu$ decays. For the most part, the
study is carried out in an effective field theory framework with an underlying
$SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry that emphasizes the model-independent
correlations arising between low- and high-energy observables. For example, a
connection between $B$-decays and top physics is pointed out. To complement the
discussion, all possible (spin 0 and 1) leptoquark models are matched to the
low-energy field theory so that the effective analysis can be used to survey
these candidates for new physics. These models also serve as concrete examples
where the hypotheses of this work can be implemented.

a variety of attacks. We focus on traffic correlation attacks, which are no
longer solely in the realm of academic research with recent revelations about
the NSA and GCHQ actively working to implement them in practice.
  Our first contribution is an empirical study that allows us to gain a high
fidelity snapshot of the threat of traffic correlation attacks in the wild. We
find that up to 40% of all circuits created by Tor are vulnerable to attacks by
traffic correlation from Autonomous System (AS)-level adversaries, 42% from
colluding AS-level adversaries, and 85% from state-level adversaries. In
addition, we find that in some regions (notably, China and Iran) there exist
many cases where over 95% of all possible circuits are vulnerable to
correlation attacks, emphasizing the need for AS-aware relay-selection.
  To mitigate the threat of such attacks, we build Astoria--an AS-aware Tor
client. Astoria leverages recent developments in network measurement to perform
path-prediction and intelligent relay selection. Astoria reduces the number of
vulnerable circuits to 2% against AS-level adversaries, under 5% against
colluding AS-level adversaries, and 25% against state-level adversaries. In
addition, Astoria load balances across the Tor network so as to not overload

the recovery of low rank tensors from incomplete linear information. While the
reconstruction of low rank matrices via nuclear norm minimization is rather
well-understand by now, almost no theory is available for the extension to
higher order tensors due to various theoretical and computational difficulties
arising for tensor decompositions. In fact, nuclear norm minimization for
matrix recovery is a tractable convex relaxation approach, but the extension of
the nuclear norm to tensors is in general NP-hard to compute. In this article,
we introduce convex relaxations of the tensor nuclear norm which are computable
in polynomial time via semidefinite programming. Our approach is based on theta
bodies, a concept from computational algebraic geometry similar to the Lasserre
relaxations. We introduce polynomial ideals which are generated by the second
order minors corresponding to different matricizations of the tensor (where the
tensor entries are treated as variables) such that the nuclear norm ball is the
convex hull of the algebraic variety of the ideal. The $k$-th theta body for
such an ideal generates a new norm which we call the $\theta_k$-norm. We show
that in the matrix case, these norms reduce to the nuclear norm. For tensors of
order $d \geq 3$ however, we obtain new norms. The sequence of the
corresponding unit-$\theta_k$-norm balls converges asymptotically to the unit
tensor nuclear norm ball. By providing the Gr\""obner basis for the ideals, we
explicitly give semidefinite programs for the computation of the
$\theta_k$-norm and for the minimization of the $\theta_k$-norm under an affine
constraint. Numerical experiments for order-3 tensor recovery via
$\theta_1$-norm minimization suggest that our approach successfully
reconstructs tensors of low rank from incomplete linear (random) measurements.

lines, 19 H_alpha recombination lines and the continuum from 1 to 2 GHz of a
significant fraction of the Milky Way (l=15-67deg, |b|<1deg) at ~20""
resolution. In this paper, we focus on the HI emission from the W43
star-formation complex. Classically, the HI 21cm line is treated as optically
thin with column densities calculated under this assumption. This might give
reasonable results for regions of low-mass star-formation, however, it is not
sufficient to describe GMCs. We analyzed strong continuum sources to measure
the optical depth, and thus correct the HI 21cm emission for optical depth
effects and weak diffuse continuum emission. Hence, we are able to measure the
HI mass of W43 more accurately and our analysis reveals a lower limit of
M=6.6x10^6 M_sun, which is a factor of 2.4 larger than the mass estimated with
the assumption of optically thin emission. The HI column densities are as high
as N(HI)~150 M_sun/pc^2 ~ 1.9x10^22 cm^-2, which is an order of magnitude
higher than for low mass star formation regions. This result challenges
theoretical models that predict a threshold for the HI column density of ~10
M_sun/pc^2, at which the formation of molecular hydrogen should set in. By
assuming an elliptical layered structure for W43, we estimate the particle
density profiles. While at the cloud edge atomic and molecular hydrogen are
well mixed, the center of the cloud is strongly dominated by molecular
hydrogen. We do not identify a sharp transition between hydrogen in atomic and
molecular form. Our results are an important characterization of the atomic to
molecular hydrogen transition in an extreme environment and challenges current
theoretical models.

only on monoallele activation, and cannot explain recent observations in
mutants, especially the reduced global diversity of expressed ORs in G9a/GLP
knockouts. In this work we integrated existing information on OR expression,
and constructed a comprehensive model that has all its components based on

three-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic
barrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop that mechanistically
differs from previous theoretical proposals, and a previously unidentified
enhancer competition step. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR

random matrices, in the case where each of the diagonals varies over a separate
compact set, say $U,V,W\subset\mathbb{C}$. Such matrices are sometimes termed
stochastic Toeplitz matrices $A_+$ in the semi-infinite case and stochastic
Laurent matrices $A$ in the bi-infinite case. Their spectra, $\Sigma=$ spec $A$
and $\Sigma_+=$ spec $A_+$, are independent of $A$ and $A_+$ as long as $A$ and
$A_+$ are pseudoergodic (in the sense of E.B. Davies, Commun. Math. Phys.,
2001), which holds almost surely in the random case. This was shown in Davies
(2001) for $A$; that the same holds for $A_+$ is one main result of this paper.
We give upper and lower bounds on $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma_+$, and we explicitly
compute a set $G$ that fills the gap between the two in the sense that
$\Sigma\cup G=\Sigma_+$. We show that invertibility of one operator $A_+$
implies invertibility - and uniform boundedness of the inverses - of all finite
square matrices with three diagonals in $U, V$ and $W$. This implies that the
so-called finite section method for the approximate solution of a system
$A_+x=b$ is applicable as soon as $A_+$ is invertible, and that the same method
for estimating the spectrum of $A_+$ does not suffer from spectral pollution.
Both results illustrate that tridiagonal stochastic Toeplitz operators share
important properties of (classical) Toeplitz operators. One of our main tools
is a new version of the Coburn lemma for classical Toeplitz operators, saying
that a stochastic tridiagonal Toeplitz operator, if Fredholm, is always
injective or surjective. In the final part we bound and compare the norms, and

(2010) and Clark (2013), have drawn attention to possible truncation in Pareto
tail modelling. Sometimes natural upper bounds exist that truncate the
probability tail, such as the Maximum Possible Loss in insurance treaties. At
other instances ultimately at the largest data, deviations from a Pareto tail
behaviour become apparent. This matter is especially important when
extrapolation outside the sample is required. Given that in practice one does
not always know whether the distribution is truncated or not, we consider
estimators for extreme quantiles both under truncated and non-truncated
Pareto-type distributions. Hereby we make use of the estimator of the tail
index for the truncated Pareto distribution first proposed in Aban {\it et al.}
(2006). We also propose a truncated Pareto QQ-plot and a formal test for
truncation in order to help deciding between a truncated and a non-truncated
case. In this way we enlarge the possibilities of extreme value modelling using
Pareto tails, offering an alternative scenario by adding a truncation point $T$
that is large with respect to the available data. In the mathematical modelling
we hence let $T \to \infty$ at different speeds compared to the limiting
fraction ($k/n \to 0$) of data used in the extreme value estimation. This work
is motivated using practical examples from different fields of applications,
simulation results, and some asymptotic results.

beginning, the random walk of a particle is considered in a system with a
discrete time and space variable and then the probability describing the
evolution of the particle's position (Green's function) is transformed into a
continuous system. Two models are considered differing here from each other
regarding the assumptions about how the particle is stopped or reflected by the
membrane when the particle attempts to pass through the membrane fails. We show
that for a system in which a membrane is partially permeable with respect to
both its sides the Green's functions obtained for both models within the {\it
continuous time random walk formalism} are equivalent to each other and
expressed by the functions presented in the paper: T. Koszto{\l}owicz, Phys.

  We also present the generalized method of images which provides the Green's
functions for the membrane system, obtained in this paper. This method, which
has a simple physical interpretation, is of a general nature and, in our
opinion, can be used to find the Green's functions for a system with a thin
membrane in which various models of subdiffusion can be applied. As an example,
we find the Green's functions for the particular case of a `slow--subdiffusion'
process in a system with a thin membrane.

Dynamical mass measurements are available only for few ($\sim{}10$) BHs in
X-ray binaries, while theoretical models strongly depend on the hydrodynamics
of supernova (SN) explosions and on the evolution of massive stars. In this
paper, we present and discuss the mass spectrum of compact remnants that we
obtained with SEVN, a new public population-synthesis code, which couples the
PARSEC stellar evolution tracks with up-to-date recipes for SN explosion
(depending on the Carbon-Oxygen mass of the progenitor, on the compactness of
the stellar core at pre-SN stage, and on a recent two-parameter criterion based
on the dimensionless entropy per nucleon at pre-SN stage). SEVN can be used
both as a stand-alone code and in combination with direct-summation N-body
codes (Starlab, HiGPUs). The PARSEC stellar evolution tracks currently
implemented in SEVN predict significantly larger values of the Carbon-Oxygen
core mass with respect to previous models. For most of the SN recipes we adopt,
this implies substantially larger BH masses at low metallicity
($\leq{}2\times{}10^{-3}$), than other population-synthesis codes. The maximum
BH mass found with SEVN is $\sim{}$25, 60 and 130 M$_{\odot}$ at metallicity $Z
=2 \times{} 10^{-2}$ , $2 \times{}10^{-3}$ and $2\times{} 10^{-4}$ ,
respectively. Mass loss by stellar winds plays a major role in determining the
mass of BHs for very massive stars ($\geq{}90$ M$_\odot{}$), while the remnant
mass spectrum depends mostly on the adopted SN recipe for lower progenitor
masses. We discuss the implications of our results for the transition between
NS and BH mass, and for the expected number of massive BHs (with mass $>25$
M$_\odot{}$) as a function of metallicity.

the elusive heavy fermion $\mathrm{URu_{2}Si_{2}}$. While tetragonal
symmetry-breaking was reported below the hidden-order (HO) transition at
$T_{HO}\approx17.5$ K, time-reversal symmetry-breaking was observed below the
superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}<T_{HO}$. Although the latter
results have been used to argue in favor of a chiral $d+id$ superconducting
state, such an order parameter is incompatible with broken tetragonal symmetry.
Here, we employ a phenomenological model to investigate the properties of a
chiral superconducting state that develops inside the hidden-order phase. In
this case, there are actually two superconducting transition temperatures:
while $T_{c}$ marks a normal-state to superconducting transition,
$T_{c}^{*}<T_{c}$ signals a superconducting-to-superconducting transition in
which time-reversal symmetry is broken. In the phase $T_{c}^{*}<T<T_{c}$, the
low-energy density of states $\rho\left(\omega\right)$ is enhanced due to the
crossing of two nodal lines, giving rise to an unusual $\omega\log(\omega)$
dependence of $\rho\left(\omega\right)$, which is manifested in several
thermodynamic properties. We also investigate the emergence of a soft amplitude
gap mode near $T_{c}^{*}$. In contrast to the usual amplitude mode near a
regular normal-state to superconducting transition, this mode becomes soft near
a superconducting-to-superconducting transition, which in principle allows for
its detection by Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we investigate the impact of twin
domains on the anisotropic properties of the superconducting state, and propose
experiments in mechanically strained samples to explore the interplay between
hidden order and superconductivity in $\mathrm{URu_{2}Si_{2}}$.

Managing, storing, and recreating these dataset versions is a non-trivial task.
The fundamental challenge here is the $storage-recreation\;trade-off$: the more
storage we use, the faster it is to recreate or retrieve versions, while the
less storage we use, the slower it is to recreate or retrieve versions. Despite
the fundamental nature of this problem, there has been a surprisingly little

properties of the magnetic domain wall (MDW) motion in disordered media when an
external driving field is present. We consider a (1+1)-dimensional model, based
on evolution rules, able to describe the MDW avalanches. The global interface
width of this model shows Family-Vicsek scaling with roughness exponent
$\zeta\simeq 1.585$ and growth exponent $\beta\simeq 0.975$. In contrast, this
model shows scaling anomalies in the interface local properties characteristic
of other systems with depinning transition of the MDW, e.g. quenched
Edwards-Wilkinson (QEW) equation and random-field Ising model (RFIM) with
driving. We show that, at the depinning transition, the saturated average
velocity $v_\mathrm{sat}\sim f^\theta$ vanished very slowly (with $\theta\simeq
0.037$) when the reduced force $f=p/p_\mathrm{c}-1\to 0^{+}$. The simulation
results show that this model verifies all accepted scaling relations which
relate the global exponents and the correlation length (or time) exponents,
valid in systems with depinning transition. Using the interface tilting method,
we show that the model, close to the depinning transition, exhibits a
nonlinearity similar to the one included in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
equation. The nonlinear coefficient $\lambda\sim f^{-\phi}$ with $\phi\simeq
-1.118$, which implies that $\lambda\to 0$ as the depinning transition is
approached, a similar qualitatively behaviour to the driven RFIM. We conclude
this work by discussing the main features of the model and the prospects opened
by it.

characterized by a time scale $\delta t$, and {\em instantaneous quenches},
within the framework of exactly solvable mass quenches in free scalar field
theory. Our earlier studies \cite{dgm1,dgm2} highlighted that the two protocols
remain distinct in the limit $\delta t \rightarrow 0$ because of the relation
of the quench rate to the UV cut-off, i.e., $1/\delta t\ll\Lambda$ always holds
in the fast smooth quenches while $1/\delta t\sim\Lambda$ for instantaneous
quenches. Here we study UV finite quantities like correlators at finite spatial
distances and the excess energy produced above the final ground state energy.
We show that at late times and large distances (compared to the quench time
scale) the smooth quench correlator approaches that for the instantaneous
quench. At early times, we find that for small spatial separation and small
$\delta t$, the correlator scales universally with $\delta t$, exactly as in
the scaling of renormalized one point functions found in earlier work. At
larger separation, the dependence on $\delta t$ drops out. The excess energy
density is finite (for finite $m\delta t$) and scales in a universal fashion
for all $d$. However, the scaling behaviour produces a divergent result in the
limit $m\delta t \rightarrow 0$ for $d\ge4$, just as in an instantaneous
quench, where it is UV divergent for $d \geq 4$. We argue that similar results
hold for arbitrary interacting theories: the excess energy density produced is
expected to diverge for scaling dimensions $\Delta > d/2$.

Solver is called Godunov SPH. We further extend the Godunov SPH to the
description of a medium with negative pressure. Under certain circumstances,
the SPH method shows an unphysical instability that results in particle
clustering. This instability is called the tensile instability. The tensile
instability occurs in positive pressure regions in a regular fluid if a very
large number of neighbor particles are used with certain shapes of kernel
functions, and it is significant in negative pressure regions that emerge in
stretched elastic bodies. We must suppress the tensile instability in SPH for
calculations of elastic bodies. In this study, we develop a new technique to
remove the tensile instability by extending the Godunov SPH method and
conducting a linear stability analysis of the equation of motion for the
extended method. We find that the tensile instability can be suppressed by
choosing an appropriate order of interpolation in the equation of motion of the
Godunov SPH method. We also derive an analytic solution for a Riemann solver
for a simple equation of state of an elastic body, and construct a Godunov SPH
method for the equation of state that allows negative pressure.

of multi-source information for establishing the attributes has been widely
recognized. Multi-feature visual recognition has recently received much
attention in multimedia applications. This paper studies visual understanding
via a newly proposed l_2-norm based multi-feature shared learning framework,
which can simultaneously learn a global label matrix and multiple
sub-classifiers with the labeled multi-feature data. Additionally, a group
graph manifold regularizer composed of the Laplacian and Hessian graph is
proposed for better preserving the manifold structure of each feature, such
that the label prediction power is much improved through the semi-supervised
learning with global label consistency. For convenience, we call the proposed
approach Global-Label-Consistent Classifier (GLCC). The merits of the proposed
method include: 1) the manifold structure information of each feature is
exploited in learning, resulting in a more faithful classification owing to the
global label consistency; 2) a group graph manifold regularizer based on the
Laplacian and Hessian regularization is constructed; 3) an efficient
alternative optimization method is introduced as a fast solver owing to the
convex sub-problems. Experiments on several benchmark visual datasets for
multimedia understanding, such as the 17-category Oxford Flower dataset, the
challenging 101-category Caltech dataset, the YouTube & Consumer Videos dataset

photoresponses of MoS2, persistent photoconductivity (PPC) at different levels
has been reported. However, a detailed study of the PPC effect and its
mechanism in MoS2 is still not available, despite the importance of this effect
on the photoresponse of the material. Here, we present a systematic study of
the PPC effect in monolayer MoS2 and conclude that the effect can be attributed
to random localized potential fluctuations in the devices. Notably, the
potential fluctuations originate from extrinsic sources based on the substrate
effect of the PPC. Moreover, we point out a correlation between the PPC effect

of numbers in real-life data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits
approximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that low digits occur much more
frequently than high digits in the first place. For example, digit 1 occurs
approximately 30.1% in the first place in random numbers, while digit 9 occurs
only approximately 4.6%. In this article it is shown that a process where a
large enough set of identical quantities constantly alternates between
minuscule random consolidations (summing two randomly chosen values into a
singular value) and tiny random fragmentations (division of one randomly chosen
value into two new values) converges digit-wise to the Benford proportions
after sufficiently many such cycles. The statistical tendency of the system
after numerous cycles is to have approximately 2/3 multiplicative expressions
which are conducive to Benford behavior as they tend to the Lognormal
Distribution, and 1/3 additive expressions which are detrimental to Benford
behavior as they tend to the Normal Distribution, hence the process represents
in essence a tug of war between addition and multiplication. Since the process
encounters the so-called Achilles' heel of the Central Limit Theorem, namely
additions of skewed distributions with high order of magnitude, additions are
not very effective, and the war is decisively won by multiplication, leading to
Benford behavior. Randomness in selecting the particular quantity to be
fragmented, as well as randomness in selecting the two particular quantities to
be consolidated, is essential for convergence. Not surprisingly then,
fragmentation itself could be performed either randomly say via a realization
from the continuous Uniform on (0, 1), or deterministically via any fixed split
ratio such as say 25% - 75%, and Benford's Law emerges in either case.

routing. This is necessary to avoid loops, inhibiting opportunities to
implement an adaptive and intelligent forwarding plane. Consequently, content
distribution efficiency is reduced due to a lack of inherent multi-path
transmission. In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a
supporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance
content dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design,
implement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called
Stochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. SAF imitates a self-adjusting
water pipe system, intelligently guiding and distributing Interests through
network crossings circumventing link failures and bottlenecks. Just as real
pipe systems, SAF employs overpressure valves enabling congested nodes to lower
pressure autonomously. Through an implicit feedback mechanism it is ensured
that the fraction of the traffic forwarded via congested nodes decreases. By
conducting simulations we show that our approach outperforms existing
forwarding strategies in terms of the Interest satisfaction ratio in the
majority of the evaluated scenarios. This is achieved by extensive utilization
of NDN's multipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the
routing plane. SAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that
are likely to be dropped anyway. This enables SAF to identify new paths to the
content origin or to cached replicas, circumventing link failures and resource
shortages without relying on routing updates.

broad (FWHM 735 km/s) and seems to have a flat-topped or double-peaked line
profile. A velocity map of the line shows a gradient across the source that
indicates large-scale rotation of star-forming gas. Together, the velocity map
and line profile suggest the presence of a massive rotating disc with a
dynamical mass M_dyn > 5x10^10 M_sun. Using the assumption of a rotating disc
origin, we employ an empirical relation between galaxy disc circular velocity
and bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) to estimate that sigma > 310 km/s,
subject to a correction for the unknown disc inclination. This result implies
that this source is consistent with the local M--sigma relation, or offset at
most by an order of magnitude in black hole mass. In contrast, the assumption
of a bulge origin for the [C II] emission line would lead to a conclusion that
the black hole is nearly two orders of magnitude more massive than predicted by
the M--sigma relation, similar to previous findings for other high-redshift
QSOs. As disc rotation may be a common origin for [C II] emission at high
redshifts, these results stress that careful consideration of dynamical origins
is required when using observations of this line to derive properties of

a detailed treatment of the case of a single linear mixture. Notably, our

We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for identifiability and give a
simple sufficient criterion together with an explicit construction to determine
the weights and the source signals for deterministic data by taking advantage
of the hierarchical structure within the possible mixture values. We show that
the probability of identifiability is related to the distribution of a hitting

First, the main terms of the AL CVC does not qualitatively change the results

Second, $\rho_{ab}$ and $R_{\textrm{H}}$ near the AF QCP have high-temperature

studying an elemental wireless network, the so called symmetric interference
relay channel (IRC), from a generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) perspective.
This is motivated by the fact that the deployment of relays is considered as a
remedy to overcome the bottleneck of current systems in terms of achievable
rates. The focus of this work is on the regime in which the interference link
is weaker than the source-relay link in the IRC. Our approach towards studying
the GDoF goes through the capacity analysis of the linear deterministic IRC
(LD-IRC). New upper bounds on the sum-capacity of the LD-IRC based on
genie-aided approaches are established. These upper bounds together with some
existing upper bounds are achieved by using four novel transmission schemes.
Extending the upper bounds and the transmission schemes to the Gaussian case,
the GDoF of the Gaussian IRC is characterized for the aforementioned regime.
This completes the GDoF results available in the literature for the symmetric
GDoF. It is shown that in the strong interference regime, in contrast to the
IC, the GDoF is not a monotonically increasing function of the interference

interpretation of the oscillatory transients observed in light-harvesting

than theoretically predicted electronic coherence lifetime. As a plausible
explanation for this long-lived spectral beating in 2D electronic spectra,
quantum-mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states (vibronic
excitons) were proposed by Christensson et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 116, 7449

produces little beating of electronic origin in the absence of vibronic
contributions, and examine the impact of protein-induced fluctuations upon
electronic-vibrational quantum mixtures by calculating the electronic energy
transfer dynamics and 2D electronic spectra in a numerically accurate manner.
It is found that, at cryogenic temperatures, the electronic-vibrational quantum
mixtures are rather robust, even under the influence of the fluctuations and
despite the small Huang-Rhys factors of the Franck-Condon active vibrational
modes. This results in long-lasting beating behavior of vibrational origin in
the 2D electronic spectra. At physiological temper- atures, however, the
fluctuations eradicate the mixing and, hence, the beating in the 2D spectra
disappears. Further, it is demonstrated that such electronic-vibrational
quantum mixtures do not necessarily play a significant role in electronic
energy trans- fer dynamics, despite contributing to the enhancement of
long-lived quantum beating in 2D electronic spectra, contrary to speculations

we apply this relaxation mode analysis to extract reaction coordinates for a

the lower dimensional operator, a calculation of the decay amplitudes is
possible without complications from operators with wrong chirality, as for the

possibility of calculations with the Wilson fermion action, we consider the

transformation based $\ell_1$ minimization, to solve the $\ell_0$ minimization
problem for an over-determined linear system corrupted by additive sparse
errors with arbitrary intensity. Many previous works have shown that $\ell_1$
minimization can be applied to realize sparse error detection in many
over-determined linear systems. However, performance of this approach is
strongly dependent on the structure of the measurement matrix, which limits
application possibility in practical problems. Here, we present a new approach
based on transforming the $\ell_0$ minimization problem by a linear
transformation that keeps sparsest solutions invariant. We call such a property
a sparsity invariant property (SIP), and a linear transformation with SIP is
referred to as a sparsity invariant transformation (SIT). We propose the
SIT-based $\ell_1$ minimization method by using an SIT in conjunction with
$\ell_1$ relaxation on the $\ell_0$ minimization problem. We prove that for any
over-determined linear system, there always exists a specific class of SIT's
that guarantees a solution to the SIT-based $\ell_1$ minimization is a
sparsest-errors solution. Besides, a randomized algorithm based on Monte Carlo
simulation is proposed to search for a feasible SIT.

density sampling, where certain sections of the sampling coefficients are
sampled more densely. Furthermore, it has been observed that these sampling
schemes are dependent not only on sparsity but also on the sparsity structure
of the underlying signal. This paper extends the result of (Adcock, Hansen,
Poon and Roman, arXiv:1302.0561, 2013) to the case where the sparsifying system
forms a tight frame. By dividing the sampling coefficients into levels, our
main result will describe how the amount of subsampling in each level is
determined by the local coherences between the sampling and sparsifying
operators and the localized level sparsities -- the sparsity in each level

coupling $|J|$ is small where $\bar{D}=D/\sqrt{1+D^2/(2\mu)^2}$ for a cutoff

common to strive for calibrated forecasts, that is, the predictive distribution

more than one forecaster providing predictions, and these forecasters may use

notions of cross-calibration where each forecaster is analysed with respect to
the other forecasters in a natural way. It is shown theoretically and in
simulation studies that cross-calibration is a stronger requirement on a

energy converters, but even ideal cells cannot exceed the their fundamental
thermodynamic efficiency limit, first analysed by Shockley and Queisser (SQ).
For moderated irradiation levels, the efficiency limit ranges between 30%-40%.
The efficiency loss is, to a great extent, due to the inherent heat-dissipation
accompanying the process of electro-chemical potential generation. Concepts
such as solar thermo-photovoltaics (STPV) and thermo-photonics4 aim to harness
this dissipated heat, yet exceeding the SQ limit has not been achieved, mainly
due to the very high operating temperatures needed. Recently, we demonstrated
that in high-temperature endothermic-photoluminescence (PL), the photon rate is
conserved with temperature increase, while each photon is blue shifted. We also
demonstrated how endothermic-PL generates orders of magnitude more
energetic-photons than thermal emission at similar temperatures. These new
findings show that endothermic-PL is an ideal optical heat-pump. Here, we
propose and thermodynamically analyse a novel device based on Thermally
Enhanced Photo Luminescence (TEPL). In such a device, solar radiation is
harvested by a low-bandgap PL material. In addition to the PL excitation, the
otherwise lost heat raises the temperature and allows the TEPL emission to be
coupled to a higher bandgap solar cell. The excessive thermal energy is then
converted to electrical work at high voltage and enhanced efficiency. Our
results show that such a TEPL based device can reach theoretical maximal
efficiencies of 70%, as high as in STPV, while the significantly lowered
operating temperatures are below 1000C. In addition to the theoretical
analysis, we experimentally demonstrated enhanced photo-current in TEPL device
pumped by sub-bandgap radiation. This opens the way for a new direction in
photovoltaics.

a rotation law with positive shear ('super-rotation') are linearly stable. It
is also known that a conducting fluid under the presence of a sufficiently
strong axial electric-current becomes unstable against nonaxisymmetric
disturbances. It is thus suggestive that a cylindric pinch formed by a
homogeneous axial electric-current is stabilized by rotation laws with
$d\Omega/dR \geq 0$. However, for magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm$\neq 1$ and for
slow rotation also rigid rotation and super-rotation support the instability by
lowering their critical Hartmann numbers. For super-rotation in narrow gaps and
for modest rotation rates this double-diffusive instability even exists for
toroidal magnetic fields with rather arbitrary radial profiles, the
current-free profile $B_\phi\propto 1/R$ included. For rigid rotation and for
super-rotation the sign of the azimuthal drift of the nonaxisymmetric
hydromagnetic instability pattern strongly depends on the magnetic Prandtl
number. The pattern counterrotates with the flow for Pm$\ll 1$ and it corotates
for Pm$\gg 1$ while for rotation laws with negative shear the instability
pattern migrates in the direction of the basic rotation for all Pm.
  An axial electric-current of minimal 3.6 kAmp flowing inside or outside the

provide tests for explosion models. We investigate constraints on explosive
conditions derivable from measured amounts of nickel and iron after radioactive
decays using nucleosynthesis networks with parameterized thermodynamic
trajectories. The Ni/Fe ratio is for most regimes dominated by the production
ratio of 58Ni/(54Fe + 56Ni), which tends to grow with higher neutron excess and
with higher entropy. For SN 2012ec, a supernova that produced a Ni/Fe ratio of
$3.4\pm1.2$ times solar, we find that burning of a fuel with neutron excess
$\eta \approx 6\times 10^{-3}$ is required. Unless the progenitor metallicity
is over 5 times solar, the only layer in the progenitor with such a neutron
excess is the silicon shell. Supernovae producing large amounts of stable
nickel thus suggest that this deep-lying layer can be, at least partially,
ejected in the explosion. We find that common spherically symmetric models of
$M_{\rm ZAMS} \lesssim 13$ Msun stars exploding with a delay time of less than
one second ($M_{\rm cut} < 1.5$ Msun) are able to achieve such silicon-shell
ejection. Supernovae that produce solar or sub-solar Ni/Fe ratios, such as SN
1987A, must instead have burnt and ejected only oxygen-shell material, which
allows a lower limit to the mass cut to be set. Finally, we find that the
extreme Ni/Fe value of 60-75 times solar derived for the Crab cannot be
reproduced by any realistic-entropy burning outside the iron core, and
neutrino-neutronization obtained in electron-capture models remains the only
viable explanation.

previously detected with HiCIAO are resolved more clearly, and new features are
identified, including two that are located at previously inaccessible radii
close to the star. We present a model based on the spiral density wave theory

high disk aspect ratio (H/r~0.20 at the planet locations) to account for the
large pitch angles which implies a very warm disk. Our observations reveal the

modeling of the corresponding cooling curves has been very useful to get
information on the properties of matter at very high densities. More recently,
the detection of quiescent thermal emission from neutron stars in low mass
X-ray binary systems after active periods opened a new window to the physics of
matter at lower densities. Here we analyze a few sources that have been
recently monitored and we show how the models can be used to establish
constraints on the crust composition and their transport properties, depending
on the astrophysical scenarios assumed.

quantum mechanics, ranging from the control of chemical reactions to the
implementation of gates in a quantum computer. Gradient-based optimization
methods are able to find high fidelity controls, but require considerable
numerical effort and often yield highly complex solutions. We propose here to
employ a two-stage optimization scheme to significantly speed up convergence
and achieve simpler controls. The control is initially parametrized using only
a few free parameters, such that optimization in this pruned search space can
be performed with a simplex method. The result, considered now simply as an
arbitrary function on a time grid, is the starting point for further
optimization with a gradient-based method that can quickly converge to high
fidelities. We illustrate the success of this hybrid technique by optimizing a
holonomic phasegate for two superconducting transmon qubits coupled with a
shared transmission line resonator, showing that a combination of Nelder-Mead
simplex and Krotov's method yields considerably better results than either one
of the two methods alone.

different arrangements of d_{x2-y2} orbitals carrying spins. For NaCuMoO_4(OH),
d_{x2-y2} orbitals are linked by superexchange couplings via two bridging oxide
ions, which gives a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction J_1 of -51 K and
an antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interaction J_2 of 36 K in the

discontinuities in the gray levels of image pixels. The Modulation Transfer
Function (MTF) is one of the main criteria for assessing imaging quality and is
a parameter frequently used for measuring the sharpness of an imaging system.
In order to determine the MTF, it is essential to determine the best edge from
the target image so that an edge profile can be developed and then the line
spread function and hence the MTF, can be computed accordingly. For regular
image sizes, the human visual system is adept enough to identify suitable edges
from the image. But considering huge image datasets, such as those obtained
from satellites, the image size may range in few gigabytes and in such a case,
manual inspection of images for determination of the best suitable edge is not
plausible and hence, edge profiling tasks have to be automated. This paper
presents a novel, yet simple, algorithm for edge ranking and detection from
image data-sets for MTF computation, which is ideal for automation on
vectorised graphical processing units.

independently from a previously performed analysis of our survey (Di Porto et
al. 2014). We have measured the count probability distribution function in
cells of radii 3 < R < 10 Mpc/h, deriving $\sigma_{8g}$, the volume-averaged
two-,three-,and four-point correlation functions and the normalized skewness
$S_{3g}$ and kurtosis $S_{4g}$ for volume-limited subsamples covering the

measurement of high-order correlations at z~1 in a spectroscopic redshift
survey. Our main results are the following. 1) The hierarchical scaling holds
throughout the whole range of scale and z. 2) We do not find a significant
dependence of $S_{3g}$ on luminosity (below z=0.9 $S_{3g}$ decreases with
luminosity but only at 1{\sigma}-level). 3) We do not detect a significant
dependence of $S_{3g}$ and $S_{4g}$ on scale, except beyond z~0.9, where the
dependence can be explained as a consequence of sample variance. 4) We do not
detect an evolution of $S_{3g}$ and $S_{4g}$ with z. 5) The linear bias factor
$b=\sigma_{8g}/\sigma_{8m}$ increases with z, in agreement with previous
results. 6) We quantify deviations from the linear bias by means of the Taylor
expansion parameter $b_2$. Our results are compatible with a null non-linear
bias term, but taking into account other available data we argue that there is
evidence for a small non-linear bias term.

third nn coupling, uniform chains. The magnetic properties of this system are
studied via magnetization (M), heat capacity (Cp), dielectric constant,
measurements along with ab-initio band structure calculations. Magnetic
susceptibility chi(T) data show a broad maximum at 32 K and the system orders
at low temperatures TN1=5.5 K and TN2=4.5 K, respectively. The analysis of
chi(T) data gives an intra-chain coupling, J3/kB, to be about - 42 K with
non-negligible frustrated inter-chain couplings (J1/kB and J2/kB). The hopping
parameters obtained from LDA band structure calculations also suggest the
presence of coupled uniform chains. The observation of simultaneous anomalies
in dielectric constant at TN1 and TN2 suggests the presence of
magneto-dielectric effect in SrCuTe2O6. A magnetic phase diagram is also built
based on M, C p, and dielectric constant results.

at an explanatory level as well as in a more quantitative context of Bayesian

if the latter is underwritten by an additional metaphysical hypothesis we
consider unwarranted. Instead, we suggest that fine-tuning requires no special

calculated power density spectra and rms-flux relations for two different
stages of activity, i.e. quiescence and regular outbursts. A multicomponent
power density spectrum with two break frequencies was found during both
activity stages. The rms-flux relation is obvious only in the quiescent data.
However, while the collection of all outburst data do not show this
variability, every individual outburst does show it in the majority of cases
keeping the rms value approximately in the same interval. Furthermore, the same
analysis was performed for light curve subsamples taken from the beginning,
middle and the end of the supercycle both for quiescence and regular outbursts.
Every light curve subsample shows the same multicomponent power density
spectrum. The stability of the break frequencies over the supercycle can be
confirmed for all frequencies except for the high break frequency during
outburst, which shows variability, but with rather low confidence. Finally, the
low break frequency can be associated with the geometrically thin disc or its
inner edge, while the high break frequency can originate from the inner
geometrically thick hot disc. Furthermore, with our statistical method to
simulate flickering light curves, we show that the outburst flickering light
curve of V1504 Cyg needs an additional constant flux level to explain the
observed rms-flux behaviour. Therefore, during the outbursts another

phase formation of iron nitride (Fe-N) thin films. Fe-N thin films with
different concentration of Al (Al=0, 2, 3, 6, and 12 at.%) were deposited using
dc magnetron sputtering by varying the nitrogen partial pressure between 0 to
100%. The structural and magnetic properties of the films were studied using
X-ray diffraction and polarized neutron reflectivity. It was observed that at
the lowest doping level (2 at.% of Al), nitrogen rich non-magnetic Fe-N phase
gets formed at a lower nitrogen partial pressure as compared to the un-doped
sample. Interestingly, we observed that as Al doping is increased beyond 3at.%,
nitrogen rich non-magnetic Fe-N phase appears at higher nitrogen partial
pressure as compared to un-doped sample. The thermal stability of films were
also investigated. Un-doped Fe-N films deposited at 10% nitrogen partial
pressure possess poor thermal stability. Doping of Al at 2at.% improves it
marginally, whereas, for 3, 6 and 12at.% Al doping, it shows significant
improvement. The obtained results have been explained in terms of
thermodynamics of Fe-N and Al-N.

exchange model with light meson exchanges plus a short-range $J/\psi$ exchange.
The scattering amplitude is calculated within a Bethe-Salpeter equation
approach and the poles near the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold are searched. In the
isoscalar sector, two poles found under the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold, i.e., bound
states, have the quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC})=0^-(1^{+-})$ and $0^+(1^{++})$.
The latter can be related to the $X(3872)$. In the isovector sector, a bound
state with $I^G(J^P)=1^+(1^+)$ is found with a large cutoff at about 3 GeV. If
a cutoff at about 2 GeV is adopted with which a pole carrying the quantum
number of the $X(3872)$ is produced at an energy of about 3871 MeV, the pole
for the bound state with $1^+(1^+)$ runs across the threshold to a second
Rienman sheet and becomes a resonance above the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold, which
can be identified with the $Z_c(3900)$. With such a cutoff, the $D\bar{D}^{*}$
invariant mass spectrum is also investigated and the experimental results found

CeMDA 116, 109, 2013) to the rotation of close-in satellites, Mercury, close-in
exoplanets and their host stars. The solutions show two extreme cases: close-in
giant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and
Earth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of
close-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally
driven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized, but, if the orbit
is elliptical, with a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The
rotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose
frequencies are 1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2 ... times the mean-motion. The number of
attractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital
eccentricity. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3
of the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with
a relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped,
but not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one. In that case, the relaxation is
estimated to lie in the interval 4.6 -- 27 x 10^{-9} s^{-1} (equivalent to a
quality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5<Q<50). The stars have
relaxation similar to the hot Jupiters and their rotation is also driven to the
only stationary solution existing in these cases. However, solar-type stars may
lose angular momentum due to stellar wind, braking the rotation and displacing
the attractor towards larger periods. Old active host stars with big close-in
companions generally have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of
the companions. The paper also includes the study of the energy dissipation and
the evolution of the orbital eccentricity.

scattering data satisfactorily. By performing a dynamical coupled-channels
study of the system of $\Delta\Delta$ and hidden-color channel (CC) with
quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(3^+)$ in the framework of the resonating group method
(RGM), we find that the $d^*$ has a mass of about $2.38-2.42$ GeV and a
root-mean-square radius (RMS) of about $0.76-0.88$ fm. The channel wave
function is extracted by a projection of the RGM wave function onto the
physical basis, and the fraction of CC component in the $d^*$ is found to be
about $66\%-68\%$, which indicates that the $d^*$ is a hexaquark-dominated
exotic state. Based on this scenario the partial decay widths of $d^*\to d
\pi^0 \pi^0$ and $d^*\to d \pi^+\pi^-$ are further explicitly evaluated and the
total width is then obtained by use of the branching ratios extracted from the
measured cross sections of other possible decay channels. Both the mass and the
decay width of $d^*$ calculated in this work are compatible with the data

Adhesives (PSA) has received much attention since the 1950's, uncovering
several factors that aim at explaining their high adherence on most substrates,
such as the softness and strong viscoelastic behaviour of the adhesive, the low
thickness of the adhesive layer and its confinement by a rigid backing. The
more recent investigation of adhesives by probe-tack methods also revealed the
importance of cavitation and stringing mechanisms during debonding, underlining
the influence of large deformations and of the related non-linear response of
the material, which also intervenes during peeling. Although a global modelling
of the complex coupling of all these ingredients remains a formidable issue, we
report here some key experiments and modelling arguments that should constitute
an important step forward. We first measure a non-trivial dependence of the
adherence energy on the loading geometry, namely through the influence of the
peeling angle, which is found to be separable from the peeling velocity
dependence. This is the first time to our knowledge that such adherence energy
dependence on the peeling angle is systematically investigated and
unambiguously demonstrated. Secondly, we reveal an independent strong influence
of the large strain rheology of the adhesives on the adherence energy. We
complete both measurements with a microscopic investigation of the debonding
region. We discuss existing modellings in light of these measurements and of
recent soft material mechanics arguments, to show that the adherence energy
during peeling of PSA should not be associated to the propagation of an
interfacial stress singularity. The relevant deformation mechanisms are
actually located over the whole adhesive thickness, and the adherence energy
during peeling of PSA should rather be associated to the energy loss by viscous
friction and by rate-dependent elastic hysteresis.

function of cratercentric distance using data from the Lunar Prospector Neutron
Spectrometer. The count rate, stacked over many craters, peaks over the crater
centre, has a minimum near the crater rim, and at larger distances, it
increases to a mean value that is up to 1% lower than the mean count rate
observed over the crater. A simple model is presented, based upon an analytical
topographical profile for the stacked craters fitted to data from the Lunar
Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA). The effect of topography coupled with neutron
beaming from the surface largely reproduces the observed count rate profiles.
However, a model that better fits the observations can be found by including
the additional freedom to increase the neutron emissivity of the crater area by
~0.35% relative to the unperturbed surface. It is unclear what might give rise
to this effect, but it may relate to additional surface roughness in the
vicinities of craters. The amplitude of the crater-related signal in the
neutron count rate is small, but not too small to demand consideration when
inferring water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) weight percentages in polar
permanently shaded regions (PSRs). If the crater-wide count rate excess is
concentrated into a much smaller PSR, then it can lead to a significantly
biased inferred WEH weight percentage. For instance, it may increase the
inferred WEH for Cabeus crater at the Moon's South Pole from ~1% to ~4%.

model is introduced to represent errors in the decoder and it is shown that,
under this model, polarization does not happen, meaning that fully reliable

frame error rate of polar codes under faulty SC decoding is provided, which is
then used, along with a well-known upper bound, in order to choose a
blocklength that minimizes the erasure probability under faulty decoding.
Finally, an unequal error protection scheme that can re-enable asymptotically
erasure-free transmission at a small rate loss and by protecting only a
constant fraction of the decoder is proposed. The same scheme is also shown to
significantly improve the finite-length performance of the faulty successive
cancellation decoder by protecting as little as 1.5% of the decoder.

by regulating the expression of target proteins. Both in signaling networks and
gene regulation there are two main mechanisms by which the concentration can be
encoded internally: amplitude modulation (AM), where the absolute concentration
of an internal signaling molecule encodes the stimulus, and frequency
modulation (FM), where the period between successive bursts represents the
stimulus. Although both mechanisms have been observed in biological systems,
the question of when it is beneficial for cells to use either AM or FM is
largely unanswered. Here, we first consider a simple model for a single
receptor (or ion channel), which can either signal continuously whenever a
ligand is bound, or produce a burst in signaling molecule upon receptor
binding. We find that bursty signaling is more accurate than continuous
signaling only for sufficiently fast dynamics. This suggests that modulation
based on bursts may be more common in signaling networks than in gene
regulation. We then extend our model to multiple receptors, where continuous
and bursty signaling are equivalent to AM and FM respectively, finding that AM
is always more accurate. This implies that the reason some cells use FM is
related to factors other than accuracy, such as the ability to coordinate
expression of multiple genes or to implement threshold crossing mechanisms.

dwarf spheroidal companion of M31, we study its origin via mergers of disky

the initial inclination of their disks with respect to the orbit and the amount
of orbital angular momentum. On radial orbits the amount of prolate rotation in
the merger remnants correlates strongly with the inclination of the disks and
is well understood as due to the conservation of the angular momentum component
of the disks along the merger axis. For non-radial orbits prolate rotation may
still be produced if the orbital angular momentum is initially not much larger
than the intrinsic angular momentum of the disks. The orbital structure of the
remnants with significant rotation is dominated by box orbits in the center and
long-axis tubes in the outer parts. The frequency analysis of stellar orbits in
the plane perpendicular to the major axis reveals the presence of two families
roughly corresponding to inner and outer long-axis tubes. The fraction of inner
tubes is largest in the remnant forming from disks oriented most vertically
initially and is responsible for the boxy shape of the galaxy. We conclude that
prolate rotation results from mergers with a variety of initial conditions and
no fine tuning is necessary to reproduce this feature. We compare the
properties of our merger remnants to those of dwarfs resulting from the tidal
stirring scenario and the data for Andromeda II.

  Small updates to text, corrected some errors in equations and figure labels",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The experimental data from quasielastic electron scattering from $^{12}$C are
reanalyzed in terms of a new scaling variable suggested by the interacting
relativistic Fermi gas with scalar and vector interactions, which is known to
generate a relativistic effective mass for the interacting nucleons. By
choosing a mean value of this relativistic effective mass $m_N^* =0.8 m_N$, we
observe that most of the data fall inside a region around the inverse
parabola-shaped universal scaling function of the relativistic Fermi gas. This
suggests a method to select the subset of data that highlight the quasielastic
region, about two thirds of the total 2,500 data. Regardless of the momentum
and energy transfer, this method automatically excludes the data that are not
dominated by the quasielastic process. The resulting band of data reflects
deviations from the perfect universality, and can be used to characterize
experimentally the quasielastic peak, despite the manifest scaling violation.
Moreover we show that the spread of the data around the scaling function can be
interpreted as genuine fluctuations of the effective mass $M^* \equiv m^*_N/m_N
\sim 0.8 \pm 0.1$. Applying the same procedure we transport the scaling
quasielastic band into a theoretical prediction band for neutrino scattering
cross section that is compatible with the recent measurements and slightly more
accurate.

extensively in the last few years. However, most papers consider submodular set
functions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case
of submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a
deterministic $\frac{1}{3}$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function
on a bounded integer lattice $\{0, \ldots, C\}^n$ using a Double Greedy
framework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas
used for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to
set functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the
so-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown
that many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer
lattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the
integer lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and
assume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that
some approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular,
we can obtain a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a
$(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality
constraint and a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for a poset matroid constraint. On
the other hand, for a knapsack constraint, the problem becomes significantly
harder: even for monotone DR-submodular functions, we show that there is no
$2^{(\log (n^{1/2} - 1))^\delta - 1}$-approximation for every $\delta > 0$

propagation of the MHD oscillations in the plasma curtain taking into account
realistic 3D magnetic and density structure of the curtain. We also aim at
testing and improving coronal seismology for more accurate determination of the
magnetic field than with standard method. We use the observed morphological and
dynamical conditions, as well as plasma properties of the coronal curtain based
on Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis to initialize a 3D MHD model of
its vertical and transverse oscillations by implementing the impulsively
excited velocity pulse mimicking the flare generated nonlinear fast
magnetosonic propagating disturbance interacting with the curtain obliquely.
The model is simplified by utilizing initial dipole magnetic field, isothermal
energy equation, and gravitationally stratified density guided by observational
parameters. Using the 3D MHD model, we are able to reproduce the details of the
vertical oscillations and study the process of their excitation by nonlinear
fast magnetosonic pulse, propagation, and damping, finding agreement with the
observations. We estimate the accuracy of simplified slab-based coronal
seismology by comparing the determined magnetic field strength to actual values

  Group","15 pages, 7 figures -- accepted by Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Cheshire Cat is a relatively poor group of galaxies dominated by two
luminous elliptical galaxies surrounded by at least four arcs from
gravitationally lensed background galaxies that give the system a humorous
appearance. Our combined optical/X-ray study of this system reveals that it is
experiencing a line of sight merger between two groups with a roughly equal
mass ratio with a relative velocity of ~1350 km/s. One group was most likely a
low-mass fossil group, while the other group would have almost fit the
classical definition of a fossil group. The collision manifests itself in a
bimodal galaxy velocity distribution, an elevated central X-ray temperature and
luminosity indicative of a shock, and gravitational arc centers that do not
coincide with either large elliptical galaxy. One of the luminous elliptical
galaxies has a double nucleus embedded off-center in the stellar halo. The
luminous ellipticals should merge in less than a Gyr, after which observers
will see a massive 1.2-1.5 x 10^14 solar mass fossil group with an M_r = -24.0
brightest group galaxy at its center. Thus, the Cheshire Cat offers us the
first opportunity to study a fossil group progenitor. We discuss the
limitations of the classical definition of a fossil group in terms of magnitude
gaps between the member galaxies. We also suggest that if the merging of fossil
(or near-fossil) groups is a common avenue for creating present-day fossil
groups, the time lag between the final galactic merging of the system and the
onset of cooling in the shock-heated core could account for the observed lack
of well-developed cool cores in some fossil groups.

integrating knowledge represented in heterogeneous KR formalisms. Recently,
evolving Multi-Context Systems (eMCSs) have been introduced as an extension of
mMCSs that add the ability to both react to, and reason in the presence of
commonly temporary dynamic observations, and evolve by incorporating new
knowledge. However, the general complexity of such an expressive formalism may
simply be too high in cases where huge amounts of information have to be
processed within a limited short amount of time, or even instantaneously. In
this paper, we investigate under which conditions eMCSs may scale in such
situations and we show that such polynomial eMCSs can be applied in a practical
use case.

concepts in both science and the humanities: time. This elusive notion has been
not only bothering philosophers since Plato and Aristotle. It goes throughout
human history embracing all analytical and creative (anthropocentric)
disciplines. Time has been a central theme in physical and life sciences,
philosophy, psychology, music, art and many more. This theme is known with a
vast body of knowledge across different theories and categories. What has been
explored concerns its nature (rational, irrational, arational),
appearances/qualia, degrees, dimensions and scales of conceptualization
(internal, external, fractal, discrete, continuous, mechanical, quantum, local,
global, etc.). Of particular interest have been parameters of time such as
duration ranges, resolutions, modes (present, now, past, future), varieties of
tenses (e.g. present perfect, present progressive, etc.) and some intuitive,
but also fancy phenomenological characteristics such as arrow, stream, texture,
width, depth, density, even scent. Perhaps the most distinct characteristic of
this fundamental concept is the absolute time constituting the flow of
consciousness according to Husserl, the reflection of pure (human) nature
without having the distinction between exo and endo. This essay is a personal
reflection upon the meaning of time in modern physics and phenomenological
philosophy.

domain restriction and investigates the likelihood that an election is
single-peaked. We provide a very general upper bound result for domain
restrictions that can be defined by certain forbidden configurations. This
upper bound implies that many domain restrictions (including the single-peaked
restriction) are very unlikely to appear in a random election chosen according
to the Impartial Culture assumption. For single-peaked elections, this upper
bound can be refined and complemented by a lower bound that is asymptotically
tight. In addition, we provide exact results for elections with few voters or
candidates. Moreover, we consider the P\'{o}lya urn model and the Mallows model
and obtain lower bounds showing that single-peakedness is considerably more
likely to appear for certain parameterizations.

feedback acting on their elements. When described as networks, these exhibit
few or no cycles, and associated matrices have small leading eigenvalues. It
has been suggested that this architecture can confer advantages to the system
as a whole, such as `qualitative stability', but this observation does not in
itself explain how a loopless structure might arise. We show here that the
number of feedback loops in a network, as well as the eigenvalues of associated
matrices, are determined by a structural property called trophic coherence, a
measure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct levels. Our theory correctly
classifies a variety of networks -- including those derived from genes,
metabolites, species, neurons, words, computers and trading nations -- into two
distinct regimes of high and low feedback, and provides a null model to gauge
the significance of related magnitudes. Since trophic coherence suppresses
feedback, whereas an absence of feedback alone does not lead to coherence, our
work suggests that the reasons for `looplessness' in nature should be sought in
coherence-inducing mechanisms.

agent-based model of an artificial financial market. In this model,
heterogeneous agents, behaving according to the Von Neumann and Morgenstern
utility theory, may mutually interact. A Tobin-like tax (TT) on successful
investments and a flat tax are compared to assess the effects on the agents'
wealth distribution. We carry out extensive numerical simulations in two
alternative scenarios: i) a reference scenario, where the agents keep their
utility function fixed, and ii) a focal scenario, where the agents are adaptive
and self-organize in communities, emulating their neighbours by updating their
own utility function. Specifically, the interactions among the agents are
modelled through a directed scale-free network to account for the presence of
community leaders, and the herding-like effect is tested against the reference
scenario. We observe that our model is capable of replicating the benefits and
drawbacks of the two taxation systems and that the interactions among the
agents strongly affect the wealth distribution across the communities.
Remarkably, the communities benefit from the presence of leaders with
successful trading strategies, and are more likely to increase their average
wealth. Moreover, this emulation mechanism mitigates the decrease in trading
volumes, which is a typical drawback of TTs.
