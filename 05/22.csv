stability of paramagnetic FeO at high pressure and temperature. Our results
reveal a high-spin to low-spin transition within the B1 crystal structure of
FeO upon compression of the lattice volume above 73~GPa. The spin-state
transition is accompanied by an orbital-selective Mott metal-insulator
transition (MIT). The lattice volume is found to collapse by about 8.5~\% at
the MIT, implying a complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of
freedom. Our results for the electronic structure and lattice properties are in
overall good agreement with experimental data.

widespread use of computing devices in daily life has underscored the need for
zero-effort deauthentication schemes. However, the quest for eliminating user
effort may lead to hidden security flaws in the authentication schemes. As a
case in point, we investigate a prominent zero-effort deauthentication scheme,
called ZEBRA, which provides an interesting and a useful solution to a
difficult problem as demonstrated in the original paper. We identify a subtle
incorrect assumption in its adversary model that leads to a fundamental design
flaw. We exploit this to break the scheme with a class of attacks that are much
easier for a human to perform in a realistic adversary model, compared to the
na\""ive attacks studied in the ZEBRA paper. For example, one of our main
attacks, where the human attacker has to opportunistically mimic only the
victim's keyboard typing activity at a nearby terminal, is significantly more
successful compared to the na\""ive attack that requires mimicking keyboard and
mouse activities as well as keyboard-mouse movements. Further, by understanding
the design flaws in ZEBRA as cases of tainted input, we show that we can draw
on well-understood design principles to improve ZEBRA's security.

remarkable property of SN 2001gh is the lack of significant spectral evolution

explored, including radioactive decays of a moderately large amount of 56Ni,
magnetar spin-down, and interaction of SN ejecta with circumstellar medium. We
favour the latter scenario, with a SN Ib wrapped in a dense, circumstellar

parametrization gives the equation of state parameter $w$ for the dark energy
as a linear function of the scale factor $a$, namely $w = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$. In
the case of quintessence models, we find that over most of the $w_0$, $w_a$

behavior for the potential $V(\phi)$, while a one-dimensional subset of
parameter space, for which $w_a = \kappa (1+w_0)$, with $\kappa$ constant,
corresponds to a wide range of functional forms for $V(\phi)$. For barotropic

up to a multiplicative constant, depends only on $w_i = w_a + w_0$ and not on
$w_0$ and $w_a$ separately. Our results suggest that the CPL parametrization

expressed during development are typically up-regulated after D. melanogaster
embryogenesis, and include many bacterial membrane, secretion system and
ankyrin-repeat containing proteins. Sex-biased genes are often organised as
small operons of uncharacterised genes and are mainly up-regulated in adult
males D. melanogaster in an age-dependent manner suggesting a potential role in
cytoplasmic incompatibility. Our results indicate that large changes in
Wolbachia gene expression across the Drosophila life-cycle are relatively rare

host-microbe interaction in facultative endosymbionts can be successfully
identified using holo-organism expression profiling. Our work also shows that
mining public gene expression data in D. melanogaster provides a rich set of
resources to probe the functional basis of the Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis

equations including flows of moderate and large Reynolds numbers is presented.
The basic idea is that a problem-tailored function space allows prediction of
turbulent boundary layer gradients with very coarse meshes. The proposed
function space consists of a standard polynomial function space plus an
enrichment, which is constructed using Spalding's law-of-the-wall. The
enrichment function is not enforced but ""allowed"" in a consistent way and the
overall methodology is much more general and also enables other enrichment
functions. The proposed method is closely related to detached-eddy simulation
as near-wall turbulence is modeled statistically and large eddies are resolved
in the bulk flow. Interpreted in terms of a three-scale separation within the
variational multiscale method, the standard scale resolves large eddies and the
enrichment scale represents boundary layer turbulence in an averaged sense. The
potential of the scheme is shown applying it to turbulent channel flow of
friction Reynolds numbers from $Re_{\tau}=590$ and up to $5,000$, flow over
periodic constrictions at the Reynolds numbers $Re_H=10,595$ and $19,000$ as
well as backward-facing step flow at $Re_h=5,000$, all with extremely coarse
meshes. Excellent agreement with experimental and DNS data is observed with the
first grid point located at up to $y_1^+=500$ and especially under adverse
pressure gradients as well as in separated flows.

a fixed but unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on $\mathbb{Q}^n\times \{\pm

of a halfspace classifier for $\mathcal{D}$. A learner who can access
$\mathcal{D}$ has to return a hypothesis whose error is small compared to
$\mathrm{Err}_{\mathrm{HALF}}(\mathcal{D})$.
  Using the recently developed method of the author, Linial and Shalev-Shwartz
we prove hardness of learning results under a natural assumption on the
complexity of refuting random $K$-$\mathrm{XOR}$ formulas. We show that no
efficient learning algorithm has non-trivial worst-case performance even under
the guarantees that $\mathrm{Err}_{\mathrm{HALF}}(\mathcal{D}) \le \eta$ for
arbitrarily small constant $\eta>0$, and that $\mathcal{D}$ is supported in

its error must be $\ge \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n^c}$ for every $c>0$. In

Under a stronger version of the assumption (where $K$ can be poly-logarithmic

high-density feature in the circumstellar disk located >8 AU from the star. We
also present KELT-North observations of V409 Tau, a relatively unstudied young
stellar object also in Taurus-Auriga, showing short timescale erratic
variability, along with two separate long and deep dimming events, one from
January 2009 through late October 2010, and the other from March 2012 until at
least September 2013. We interpret both dimming events to have lasted more than
600 days, each with a depth of ~1.4 mag. From a spectral energy distribution
analysis, we propose that V409 Tau is most likely surrounded by a circumstellar
disk viewed nearly edge-on, and using Keplerian timescale arguments we
interpret the deep dimmings of V409 Tau as occultations from one or more
features within this disk >10 AU from the star. In both AA Tau and V409 Tau,
the usual CTTS short-timescale variations associated with accretion processes
close to the stars continue during the occultations, further supporting the
distant occulting material interpretation. Like AA Tau, V409 Tau serves as a

approximately double the size of the lensing effects compared to GR. The

the possibility that these systems can be progenitors of double neutron star
binaries. The small orbital separations of observed double neutron star
binaries suggest that the progenitor systems underwent a common envelope phase
at least once during their evolution. Bethe & Brown (1998) proposed that
massive binary twins will undergo a common envelope evolution while both
components are ascending the red giant branch or asymptotic giant branch
simultaneously, also known as double-core evolution. Using models generated
from the stellar evolution code Evolve Zero Age Main Sequence, we determine the
range of mass ratios resulting in both components simultaneously ascending the
RGB or AGB as a function of the difference in birth times, t. We find that,
even for a generous t=5 Myr, the minimum mass ratio qmin=0.933 for an 8 Solar
Mass primary and increases for larger primaries. We use a hydrodynamics code,
StarSmasher, to study specifically the evolution of q=1 common envelope systems
as a function of initial component mass, age, and orbital separation. We find
the dynamical stability limit, the largest orbital separation where the binary
becomes dynamically unstable, as a function of the component mass and age.
Finally, we calculate the efficiency of ejecting matter during the inspiral
phase to extrapolate the properties of the remnant binary from our numerical
results, assuming the common envelope is completely ejected. We find that for
the nominal core masses, there is a minimum orbital separation for a given
component mass such that the helium cores survive common envelope evolution in
a tightly bound binary and are viable progenitors for double neutron stars.

of recombination. We build upon previous TDA developments for detecting and
quantifying recombination, and present a novel framework that can be applied to
hundreds of genomes and can be interpreted in terms of minimal histories of
mutation and recombination events, quantifying the scales and identifying the
genomic locations of recombinations. We implement this framework in a software
package, called TARGet, and apply it to several examples, including small
migration between different populations, human recombination, and horizontal
evolution in finches inhabiting the Gal\'apagos Islands.

as a nuisance parameter, the unobserved product of a past history of random
mating. However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is
a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this
network of relationships as a complex object we wish to learn about, by
observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper
explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about
population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations
on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust
interpretation to the $f_4$ statistic used to identify admixture, and to design
a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common
ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets
population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over
ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable
interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing
demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it
brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in
model-based demographic inference.

  Using $\alpha$-Divergence",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data visualization is one of the major applications of nonlinear
dimensionality reduction. From the information retrieval perspective, the
quality of a visualization can be evaluated by considering the extent that the
neighborhood relation of each data point is maintained while the number of
unrelated points that are retrieved is minimized. This property can be
quantified as a trade-off between the mean precision and mean recall of the
visualization. While there have been some approaches to formulate the
visualization objective directly as a weighted sum of the precision and recall,
there is no systematic way to determine the optimal trade-off between these two
nor a clear interpretation of the optimal value. In this paper, we investigate
the properties of $\alpha$-divergence for information visualization, focusing
our attention on a particular range of $\alpha$ values. We show that the
minimization of the new cost function corresponds to maximizing a geometric
mean between precision and recall, parameterized by $\alpha$. Contrary to some
earlier methods, no hand-tuning is needed, but we can rigorously estimate the
optimal value of $\alpha$ for a given input data. For this, we provide a
statistical framework using a novel distribution called Exponential Divergence
with Augmentation (EDA). By the extensive set of experiments, we show that the
optimal value of $\alpha$, obtained by EDA corresponds to the optimal trade-off
between the precision and recall for a given data distribution.

binary frequency. The data are largely from the CORAVEL spectrophotometer and
the Moscow version, with a typical uncertainty of $\leq1$~km~s$^{-1}$, and a
time span from 1 to 20 years. A systemic velocity was obtained by removing the
pulsation component using a high order Fourier series. From this data we have
developed a list of stars showing no orbital velocity larger than
$\pm1$~km~s$^{-1}$. The binary fraction was analyzed as a function of
magnitude, and yields an apparent decrease in this fraction for fainter stars.
We interpret this as incompleteness at fainter magnitudes, and derive the
preferred binary fraction of $29\pm8$\% ( $20\pm6$\% per decade of orbital
period) from the brightest 40 stars. Comparison of this fraction in this period
range (1-20 years) implies a large fraction for the full period range. This is
reasonable in that the high accuracy velocities are sensitive to the longer
periods and smaller orbital velocity amplitudes in the period range sampled
here. Thus the Cepheid velocity sample provides a sensitive detection in the
period range between short period spectroscopic binaries and resolved
companions. The recent identification of $\delta$ Cep as a binary with very low
amplitude and high eccentricity underscores the fact that the binary fractions
we derive are lower limits, to which other low amplitude systems will probably
be added. The mass ratio (q) distribution derived from ultraviolet observations
of the secondary is consistent with a flat distribution for the applicable
period range (1 to 20 years).

neutrino transport in the ray-by-ray approximation, state-of-the-art weak
interaction physics, relativistic transport corrections such as the
gravitational redshift of neutrinos, two-dimensional hydrodynamics with the
commensurate relativistic corrections, Newtonian self-gravity with a general
relativistic monopole correction, and the Lattimer-Swesty equation of state
with 220 MeV compressibility, and begin with the most recent Woosley-Heger
nonrotating progenitors in this mass range. All of our models exhibit robust
explosions. Therefore, our waveforms capture all stages of supernova
development: 1) a relatively short and weak prompt signal, 2) a quiescent
stage, 3) a strong signal due to convection and SASI activity, 4) termination
of active accretion onto the proto-neutron star, and 5) a slowly increasing
tail that reaches a saturation value. Fourier decomposition shows that the
gravitational wave signals we predict should be observable by AdvLIGO for
Galactic events across the range of progenitors considered here. The
fundamental limitation of these models is in their imposition of axisymmetry.
Further progress will require counterpart three-dimensional models, which are

two systems are simulated on a large set of tests, and a metric, defined on
pairs of real-valued, real-timed trajectories, is used to determine a lower
bound on the distance. We show how the Skorkhod metric on continuous dynamical
systems can be used as the foundation for conformance testing of complex
dynamical models. The Skorokhod metric allows for both state value mismatches

between idealized models of dynamical systems and their implementations. We
demonstrate the robustness of the system conformance quantification by proving
a \emph{transference theorem}: trajectories close under the Skorokhod metric
satisfy ""close"" logical properties. Specifically, we show the result for the

and (3) Introduce a diagnostic experiment to detect the bias capacity in an

we plan to release an easy-to-use toolbox which combines various publicly

trends in mobile cellular systems of the fourth (4G)- and fifth generation
(5G), making it increasingly difficult to characterize aggregate interference
statistics with system models of low complexity. This paper proposes a new
circular interference model that aggregates given interferer deployments to
power profiles along circles. The model accurately preserves the original
interference statistics while considerably reducing the amount of relevant
interferers. In comparison to common approaches from stochastic geometry, it
enables to characterize cell-center- and cell-edge users, and preserves effects
that are otherwise concealed by spatial averaging. To enhance the analysis of
given power profiles and to validate the accuracy of the circular model, a new
finite sum representation for the sum of Gamma random variables with
integer-valued shape parameter is introduced. The approach allows to decompose
the distribution of the aggregate interference into the contributions of the
individual interferers. Such knowledge is particularly expedient for the
application of base station coordination- and cooperation schemes. Moreover,
the proposed approach enables to accurately predict the corresponding
signal-to-interference-ratio- and rate statistics.

the constraints from the electroweak precision data are the weakest. Among the
existing Higgs search channels, considerable constraints come from the diphoton
signal strength. We note that potential contribution to $h \rightarrow \gamma
Z$ may in principle be a useful constraining factor, but it can be utilized
only in the high energy run. The contributions to electric dipole moments
mostly lead to the strongest constraints, though somewhat fine-tuned
combinations of more than one parameter with large magnitudes are allowed. We
also discuss constraints on gauge boson trilinear couplings which depend on the

harbouring gravitational fields that deviate strongly from the Newtonian weak
field limit. Moreover strong electromagnetic fields anchored into the star give
rise to non-linear corrections to Maxwell equations described by quantum
electrodynamics (QED). Electromagnetic fields close to or above the critical
value of $\BQ=4.4\times10^9$~T are probably present in some pulsars and for
most of the magnetars. To account properly for emission emanating from the
neutron star surface like for instance thermal radiation and its polarization
properties, it is important to include general relativistic (GR) effects
simultaneously with non-linear electrodynamics. This can be achieved through a
3+1 formalism known in general relativity and that incorporates QED
perturbations to Maxwell equations. Starting from the lowest order corrections
to the Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field, as given for instance by
Born-Infeld or Euler-Heisenberg theory, we derive the non-linear Maxwell
equations in general relativity including quantum vacuum effects. We also
derive a prescription for the force-free limit and show that these equations
can be solved with classical finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation
laws. It is therefore straightforward to include general relativity and quantum
electrodynamics in the description of neutron star magnetospheres by using
standard classical numerical techniques borrowed from Maxwell and Newton
theory. As an application, we show that spin-down luminosity corrections
associated to QED effects are negligible with respect to GR corrections.

by the optical coupling, which results in correlated mechanical fluctuations of
the two oscillators. Achieving the quantum backaction dominated regime opens
the door to numerous applications of cavity optomechanics with a complex

all cases, we found that the lack of detected optical emission ruled out the
X-ray emission from the same electron population that produces radio emission.
All three sources have high total extended radio power, similar to that of FR
II sources. We find this is in good agreement with previously studied hybrid
sources, where high-power hybrid sources emit X-rays via IC/CMB and the
low-power hybrid sources emit X-rays via synchrotron emission. This supports
the idea that it is total radio power rather than FR morphology that determines
the X-ray emission mechanism. We found no significant asymmetries in the
diffuse X-ray emission surrounding the host galaxies. Sources PKS 1045-188 and

protostars. Recent observations suggest that their emission stems, not only
from the traditional hot corino, but also from offset positions. In this work,
2D physicochemical modelling of an envelope-cavity system is carried out.
Wavelength-dependent radiative transfer calculations are performed and a
comprehensive gas-grain chemical network is used to simulate the physical and
chemical structure. The morphology of the system delineates three distinct
regions: the cavity wall layer with time-dependent and species-variant
enhancements; a torus rich in complex organic ices, but not reflected in
gas-phase abundances; and the remaining outer envelope abundant in simpler
solid and gaseous molecules. Strongly irradiated regions, such as the cavity
wall layer, are subject to frequent photodissociation in the solid phase.
Subsequent recombination of the photoproducts leads to frequent reactive
desorption, causing gas-phase enhancements of several orders of magnitude. This
mechanism remains to be quantified with laboratory experiments. Direct
photodesorption is found to be relatively inefficient. If radicals are not
produced directly in the icy mantle, the formation of complex organics is
impeded. For efficiency, a sufficient number of FUV photons needs to penetrate
the envelope; and elevated cool dust temperatures need to enable grain-surface
radical mobility. As a result, a high stellar luminosity and a sufficiently
wide cavity favor chemical complexity. Furthermore within this paradigm,
complex organics are demonstrated to have unique lifetimes and be grouped into
early (formaldehyde, ketene, methanol, formic acid, methyl formate, acetic
acid, glycolaldehyde) and late (acetaldehyde, dimethyl ether, ethanol) species.

co-rotating satellites pairs is observed within $\sim 20^{\circ}-50^{\circ}$ of

relative to the line-of-sight. Instead, the excess co-rotation for satellite

associated with undersampling of an underlying isotropic velocity distribution.
We conclude that at most $10\%$ of the hosts in our sample harbor co-rotating
satellite planes (as traced by the luminous satellite population).

strongest constraints on the parameter space currently come from chargino

$\tan{\beta}$. With light top squarks in the spectrum, as required from
naturalness arguments, the situation changes dramatically; stop-assisted
chargino and neutralino production via $\tilde{t} \rightarrow b

already probing the entire parameter space compatible with the muon magnetic
moment at $\tan{\beta} \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$, while upcoming stop searches will
probe most of the parameter space at larger $\tan{\beta} \sim 40$. Direct
Higgsino searches as well as compressed slepton and stop searches are crucial
to close out corners of parameter space. We consider one such example: in the
presence of light sleptons and charginos as required to obtain appreciable
contributions to the muon magnetic moment, compressed stops can dominantly
undergo the following decay $\tilde{t} \, \rightarrow \, b \tilde{\ell} \nu
(\tilde{\nu} \ell) \, \rightarrow \, b \ell \nu \tilde{\chi}_{1}^0$,
facilitated by off-shell charginos. We find that the enhanced branching to

LHC14) of $m_{\tilde{t}} \, \sim \, 350$ GeV, with the mass difference between
stops and the lightest neutralino being $\sim 80$ GeV. This will further close
out a significant part of the parameter space compatible with naturalness and
the muon magnetic moment.

slow flows within the ejecta led to the acceleration of particles and the
production of synchrotron radiation. Soon after the start of the eruption,
shocks in the ejecta produced an unexpected radio flare, resulting in a
multi-peaked radio light curve. The emission eventually became consistent with
an expanding thermal remnant with mass $2 \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$ and
temperature $10^4$ K. However, during the first two months, the $\gtrsim 10^6$
K brightness temperature at low frequencies was too high to be due to thermal
emission from the small amount of X-ray producing shock-heated gas. Radio
imaging showed structures with velocities of 400 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc) in the
plane of the sky, perpendicular to a more elongated 1500 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc)
flow. The morpho-kinematic structure of the ejecta from V1723 Aql appears
similar to nova V959 Mon, where collisions between a slow torus and a faster
flow collimated the fast flow and gave rise to \gamma -ray producing shocks.
Optical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of V1723 Aql during the radio flare
are consistent with this picture. Our observations support the idea that shocks
in novae occur when a fast flow collides with a slow collimating torus. Such
shocks could be responsible for hard X-ray emission, \gamma -ray production,
and double-peaked radio light curves from some classical novae.

elsewhere, establishing a strong case for an improved estimator. Although the
detailed scale dependence of the bispectra differs depending on various
assumptions, generally the predicted bispectra are either effectively 1 or
2-dimensional and a simple Fourier basis suffices for accurate reconstruction.
For an optimal CMB data analysis, combining all n-point functions, the choice
for the excited state needs to be the same when computing power spectrum,
bispectrum and higher order correlation functions. This has not always been the
case, which could lead to wrong conclusions. We calculate the bispectrum for
different choices previously discussed for the power spectrum, setting up a

AKARI and Herschel. We adopt FIR luminosities at 90 and 100 um as SF

rate with FIR luminosities. By estimating AGN luminosities from [OIII]5007 and
[OI]6300 emission lines, we find a positive linear trend between FIR and AGN
luminosities over a wide dynamical range. This result appears to be
inconsistent with the recent reports that low-luminosity AGNs show essentially
no correlation between FIR and X-ray luminosities, while the discrepancy is
likely due to the Malmquist and sample selection biases. By analyzing the
spectral energy distribution, we find that pure-AGN candidates, of which FIR
radiation is thought to be AGN-dominated, show significantly low-SF activities.
These AGNs hosted by low-SF galaxies are rare in our sample (~ 1%). However,
the low fraction of low-SF AGN is possibly due to observational limitations
since the recent FIR surveys are insufficient to examine the population of
high-luminosity AGNs hosted by low-SF galaxies.

Most studies so far have focused on the electronic and optoelectronic
properties of single-layer MoS2, whose band structure features a direct
bandgap, in sharp contrast to the indirect bandgap of thicker MoS2. In this
paper, we present a systematic study of the thickness-dependent electrical and
thermoelectric properties of few-layer MoS2. We observe that the electrical
conductivity () increases as we reduce the thickness of MoS2 and peaks at about
two layers, with six-time larger conductivity than our thickest sample
(23-layer MoS2). Using a back-gate voltage, we modulate the Fermi energy () of
the sample where an increase in the Seebeck coefficient () is observed with
decreasing gate voltage () towards the subthreshold (OFF state) of the device,
reaching as large as in a four-layer MoS2. While previous reports have focused
on a single-layer MoS2 and measured Seebeck coefficient in the OFF state, which
has vanishing electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor (), we
show that MoS2-based devices in their ON state can have as large as in the
two-layer sample. The increases with decreasing thickness then drops abruptly
from double-layer to single-layer MoS2, a feature we suggest as due to a change
in the energy dependence of the electron mean-free-path according to our
theoretical calculation. Moreover, we show that care must be taken in
thermoelectric measurements in the OFF state to avoid obtaining erroneously
large Seebeck coefficients when the channel resistance is very high. Our study
paves the way towards a more comprehensive examination of the thermoelectric
performance of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors.

means of explaining the reported deficit of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) detections

distribution as a power law with a rate scaling as $S_\nu^{-5/2+\delta}$ and
account for the fact that the FRBs are detected at unknown positions within the
telescope beam. We find that the event rate of FRBs located off the Galactic
plane may be enhanced by a factor ~30-300% relative to objects near the
Galactic plane without necessarily affecting the slope of the distribution. For
FRBs whose flux densities are subject to relatively weak diffractive
scintillation, as is typical for events detected at high Galactic latitudes, we
demonstrate that an effect associated with Eddington bias is responsible for
the enhancement. The magnitude of the enhancement increases with the steepness
of the underlying flux density distribution, so that existing limits on the
disparity in event rates between high and low Galactic latitudes suggest that
the FRB population has a steep differential flux density distribution, scaling
as $S_\nu^{-3.5}$ or steeper. Existing estimates of the event rate in the flux
density range probed by the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey
overestimate the true rate by a factor of ~3.

Here we propose two non-parametric tests of strict and relaxed molecular clocks
built upon a framework that uses the empirical cumulative distribution (ECD) of
branch lengths obtained from an ensemble of Bayesian trees and well known
non-parametric (one-sample and two-sample) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
goodness-of-fit test. In the strict clock case, the method consists in using
the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to directly test if the phylogeny
is clock-like, in other words, if it follows a Poisson law. The ECD is computed
from the discretized branch lengths and the parameter $\lambda$ of the expected
Poisson distribution is calculated as the average branch length over the
ensemble of trees. To compensate for the auto-correlation in the ensemble of
trees and pseudo-replication we take advantage of thinning and effective sample
size, two features provided by Bayesian inference MCMC samplers. Finally, it is
observed that tree topologies with very long or very short branches lead to
Poisson mixtures and in this case we propose the use of the two-sample KS test
with samples from two continuous branch length distributions, one obtained from
an ensemble of clock-constrained trees and the other from an ensemble of
unconstrained trees. Moreover, in this second form the test can also be applied
to test for relaxed clock models. The use of a statistically equivalent
ensemble of phylogenies to obtain the branch lengths ECD, instead of one
consensus tree, yields considerable reduction of the effects of small sample
size and provides again of power.

are approaching the low $10^{-18}$ range, motional frequency shifts account for
a considerable fraction of the uncertainty budget. Micromotion, a driven motion
fundamentally connected to the principle of the Paul trap, is a particular
concern in these systems. In this article, we experimentally investigate at
this level three common methods for minimizing and determining the micromotion
amplitude. We develop a generalized model for a quantitative application of the
photon-correlation technique, which is applicable in the commonly encountered
regime where the transition linewidth is comparable to the rf drive frequency.
We show that a fractional frequency uncertainty due to the 2nd-order Doppler
shift below $1\times 10^{-20}$ can be achieved. The quantitative evaluation is
verified in an interleaved measurement with the conceptually simpler resolved
sideband method. If not performed deep within the Lamb-Dicke regime, a
temperature-dependent offset at the level of $10^{-19}$ is observed in resolved
sideband measurements due to sampling of intrinsic micromotion. By direct
comparison with photon-correlation measurements, we show that the simple to
implement parametric heating method is sensitive to micromotion at the level of
$1\times 10^{-20}$ as well.

where the cluster mean-field is expressed is crucial in order to obtain
high-quality results. The mean-field nature of the ansatz allows us to

existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (AlexNet,

these deep CNN architectures are designed for single-label centered-positioned
object classification. While they generate strong semantic features, they have
no inherent structure allowing them to detect multiple objects of different
sizes and locations in the frame. Our paper tries to solve this problem by
integrating the base CNN into several fully convolutional neural networks
(FCNs) to form a multi-scale network that handles multiple receptive field
sizes in the original image. FCNs, previously applied to image segmentation,
can generate class heat-maps efficiently compared to sliding window mechanisms,
and can easily handle multiple scales. To further handle the ambiguity over
multiple objects and locations, we incorporate the Multiple Instance Learning
mechanism (MIL) to consider objects in different positions and at different
scales simultaneously. We integrate our multi-scale multi-instance architecture
with a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to generate sentence
descriptions based on the visual representation. Ours is the first end-to-end
trainable architecture that is capable of multi-scale region processing.
Evaluation on a Youtube video dataset shows the advantage of our approach
compared to the original single-scale whole frame CNN model. Our flexible and

account for corrections to it near the Hubble scale. For models beyond
Horndeski gravity, we find that the velocity field and time derivative of the
spatial metric potential can generally not be neglected, even in the

sensors. The sensors observe random samples in parallel and communicate with a
fusion center, who makes the global decision based on the sensor inputs. On one
hand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely
transmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio
test (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected
sample size as error rates tend to zero. On the other hand, for systems with
limited power and bandwidth resources, decentralized solutions that only send a
summary of local samples (we particularly focus on a one-bit communication
protocol) to the fusion center is of great importance. To this end, we first
consider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized
statistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a
uniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its
suboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of
the quantized statistics under both hypotheses. We then propose a decentralized
GSPRT based on level-triggered sampling. That is, each sensor runs its own
GSPRT repeatedly and reports its local decision to the fusion center
asynchronously. We show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal as the local
thresholds and global thresholds grow large at different rates. Lastly, two
particular models and their associated applications are studied to compare the
centralized and decentralized approaches. Numerical results are provided to
demonstrate that the proposed level-triggered sampling based decentralized
scheme aligns closely with the centralized scheme with substantially lower
communication overhead, and significantly outperforms the uniform sampling and
quantization based decentralized scheme.

masses of $M_{\rm He}=0.35, 0.4, \&\ 0.51M_\odot$ and accrete onto WDs of mass
$M_{\rm WD}$ from $0.6M_\odot$ to $1.26M_\odot$. The initial orbital periods
($P_{\rm{orb}}$) span 20 to 80 minutes. For all cases, the accretion rate onto
the WD is below the stable helium burning range, leading to accumulation of
helium followed by unstable ignition. The mass of the convective core in the
donors is small enough so that the WD accretes enough helium-rich matter to
undergo a thermonuclear runaway in the helium shell before any carbon-oxygen
enriched matter is transferred. The mass of the accumulated helium shell
depends on $M_{\rm WD}$ and the accretion rate. We show that for $M_{\rm

likely vigorous enough to trigger a detonation in the helium layer. These
thermonuclear runaways may be observed as either faint and fast .Ia SNe, or, if
the carbon in the core is also detonated, Type Ia SNe. Those that survive the
first flash and eject mass will have a temporary increase in orbital
separation, but GWR drives the donor back into contact, resuming mass transfer
and triggering several subsequent weaker flashes.

(i) explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the effective contact four-fermion

by a chemical-potential-dependent scale in the Polyakov-loop potential. In
contrast to previously used analytical ansaetze, we determine its dependence on
the chemical potential from lattice data for the expectation value of the
Polyakov loop. Finally, we propose to add a two-derivative operator to our

symmetry breaking, mimicking an analogous term in the lattice Wilson action.

us to disclose a multiple-stellar-population phenomenon in NGC2808 even more
complex than previously thought. We have separated at least five different
populations along the main sequence and the red giant branch (RGB), that we
name A, B, C, D and E (though an even finer subdivision may be suggested by the
data). We identified the RGB bump in four out of the five RGBs. To explore the
origin of this complex CMD, we have combined our multi-wavelength HST
photometry with synthetic spectra, generated by assuming different chemical
compositions. The comparison of observed colors with synthetic spectra suggests
that the five stellar populations have different contents of light elements and
helium. Specifically, if we assume that NGC2808 is homogeneous in [Fe/H] (as
suggested by spectroscopy for Populations B, C, D, E, but lacking for
Population A) and that population A has a primordial helium abundance, we find
that populations B, C, D, E are enhanced in helium by Delta Y~0.03, 0.03, 0.08,
0.13, respectively. We obtain similar results by comparing the magnitude of the
RGB bumps with models. Planned spectroscopic observations will test whether
also Population A has the same metallicity, or whether its photometric
differences with Population B can be ascribed to small [Fe/H] and [O/H]
differences rather than to helium.

by the wireless communication standards. This allows the base station (BS) to
detect the subscriber stations (SS) that are willing to commence communication.
In addition, the ranging process allows the BS to estimate the uplink channel
parameters of these SSs. Accurate estimation of these parameters are crucial as
they ensure that the uplink signals from all the SSs arrive at the BS
synchronously and approximately at the same power level. However, this
detection and estimation problem turns out to be very challenging when multiple
users initiate the ranging procedure at the same time. We address this issue by
exploiting the underlying sparsity of the estimation problem. We propose a fast
sparse signal recovery approach to improve the ranging performance in
multi-user environment. Compared to the standard correlation based techniques,
our method shows a clear improvement in ranging code detection, timing offset
and channel power estimation. Although this method has been developed around
the WiMAX standard, the underlying principles apply to other OFDM based

Galactic halo (GH) gas. Here we present a systematic and uniform analysis of
archival Suzaku (29 pointings; 6 newly presented) and Swift (68 pointings; 49
newly presented) data within Galactic longitudes |l| < 20 deg and latitude 5
deg < |b| < 60 deg, covering the whole extent of the Fermi bubbles. We show
that the plasma temperature is constant at kT = 0.30+-0.07 keV, while the
emission measure (EM) varies by an order of magnitude, increasing toward the
Galactic center (i.e., low |b|) with enhancements at the north polar spur
(NPS), SE-claw and NW-clump features. Moreover, the EM distribution of kT ~
0.30 keV plasma is highly asymmetric in the northern and southern bubbles.
Although the association of the X-ray emission with the bubbles is not
conclusive, we compare the observed EM properties with simple models assuming
(i) a filled halo without bubbles, whose gas density follows a hydrostatic
isothermal model (King profile) and (ii) a bubble-in-halo in which two
identical bubbles expand into the halo forming thick shells of swept halo gas.
We argue that the EM profile in the north (b > 0 deg) favors (ii), whereas that
of the south (b < 0 deg) is rather close to (i), but weak excess signature is
clearly detected also in the south like NPS (South Polar Spur; SPS). Such an
asymmetry, if due to the bubbles, cannot be fully understood only by the
inclination of bubbles' axis against the Galactic disk normal, thus suggesting
asymmetric outflow due to different environmental/initial condition.

two channel-coded sources, multiple relays, and one destination. Due to
spectral efficiency constraint, we assume only one time slot is dedicated for
relaying. Conventional network coding based cooperation (NCC) selects the best
relay which uses network coding to serve two sources simultaneously. The
performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) of NCC, however, is not available
in the literature. In this paper, we first derive the closed-form expression
for the BER of NCC and analytically show that NCC always achieves diversity of
order two regardless the number of available relays and the channel code.
Secondly, motivated by a loss in diversity in NCC, we propose a novel relaying
scheme based on partial relaying cooperation (PARC) in which two best relays
are selected, each forwarding half of the codeword to help one source.
Closed-form expression for BER and system diversity order of the proposed
scheme are derived. Analytical results show that the diversity order of PARC is
a function of the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the minimum
distance of the channel code. More importantly, full diversity order in PARC
can be achieved for practically operating finite SNRs with the proper channel
code. Finally, intensive simulations present a huge SNR gain of PARC over NCC
and reference schemes without relay selection.

equivalentwidths of the prominent spectral lines, playing the similar role as
the multi-color photometry, form a clean stellar locus well ordered by MK
classes. The advantage of the stellar locus in line indices is that it gives a
natural and continuous classification of stars consistent with either the
broadly used MK classes or the stellar astrophysical parameters. We also employ
a SVM-based classification algorithm to assignMK classes to the LAMOST stellar
spectra. We find that the completenesses of the classification are up to 90%
for A and G type stars, while it is down to about 50% for OB and K type stars.
About 40% of the OB and K type stars are mis-classified as A and G type stars,
respectively. This is likely owe to the difference of the spectral features
between the late B type and early A type stars or between the late G and early
K type stars are very weak. The relative poor performance of the automatic MK
classification with SVM suggests that the directly use of the line indices to
classify stars is likely a more preferable choice.

shows that the empirical and the experimental results are highly compatible and
can be fitted by a single concave curve, which demonstrates that qualitatively
the growth pattern of oscillations is not affected by type of bottleneck and
lane changing behavior. We have shown theoretically that small disturbances
increase in a convex way in the initial stage in the traditional models

dynamic behavior of a neighboring electronic spin. Specifically, an
out-of-phase component appears in the electronic spin-echo signal. This
component is proportional to the nuclear spin degree of polarization and
strongly depends on the nuclear polarization direction. When the electronic
spin is surrounded by a polarized nuclear spin bath, the spin-echo quadrature
manifests a characteristic frequency related only to the nuclear spins
abundance and their collective polarization. We use this analysis to propose a
novel measurement method for the local nuclear spin bath of a single electronic
spin. We quantify the realistic experimental regimes at which the scheme is
efficient. Our proposal has potential applications for quantum sensing schemes,
and opens a route for a systematic study of polarized mesoscopical-systems.

priori knowledge of the environment, global path planning provides a
collision-free route through the workspace. The global path plan can be
calculated with a variety of informed search algorithms, most notably the A*
search method, guaranteed to deliver a complete and optimal solution that
minimizes the path cost. Path planning optimization typically looks to minimize
the distance traversed from start to goal, yet many mobile robot applications
call for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective
optimization (MOO) problem. Past studies have applied genetic algorithms to MOO
path planning problems, but these may have the disadvantages of computational
complexity and suboptimal solutions. Alternatively, the algorithm in this paper
approaches MOO path planning with the use of Pareto fronts, or finding
non-dominated solutions. The algorithm presented incorporates Pareto optimality
into every step of A* search, thus it is named A*-PO. Results of simulations
show A*-PO outperformed several variations of the standard A* algorithm for MOO
path planning. A planetary exploration rover case study was added to
demonstrate the viability of A*-PO in a real-world application.

search problem in social and information networks: given one or more query
nodes, find densely connected communities containing the query nodes. However,
most existing studies do not address the ""free rider"" issue, that is, nodes far
away from query nodes and irrelevant to them are included in the detected
community. Some state-of-the-art models have attempted to address this issue,
but not only are their formulated problems NP-hard, they do not admit any
approximations without restrictive assumptions, which may not always hold in
practice.
  In this paper, given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q, we
study community search using the k-truss based community model. We formulate
our problem of finding a closest truss community (CTC), as finding a connected
k-truss subgraph with the largest k that contains Q, and has the minimum
diameter among such subgraphs. We prove this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore,
it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $(2-\varepsilon)$, for
any $\varepsilon >0 $. However, we develop a greedy algorithmic framework,
which first finds a CTC containing Q, and then iteratively removes the furthest
nodes from Q, from the graph. The method achieves 2-approximation to the
optimal solution. To further improve the efficiency, we make use of a compact
truss index and develop efficient algorithms for k-truss identification and
maintenance as nodes get eliminated. In addition, using bulk deletion
optimization and local exploration strategies, we propose two more efficient
algorithms. One of them trades some approximation quality for efficiency while
the other is a very efficient heuristic. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world
networks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our community model and
search algorithms.

We first propose a basic attack that can automatically extract metro-related
data from a large amount of mixed accelerator readings, and then use an
ensemble interval classier built from supervised learning to infer the riding
intervals of the user. While this attack is very effective, the supervised
learning part requires the attacker to collect labeled training data for each

efficiency of our attack, we further propose a semi-supervised learning

grouped into sets based on some similarity measure. Most of the clustering
algorithms assume that the main memory is infinite and can accommodate the set
of patterns. In reality many applications give rise to a large set of patterns
which does not fit in the main memory. When the data set is too large, much of
the data is stored in the secondary memory. Input/Outputs (I/O) from the disk
are the major bottleneck in designing efficient clustering algorithms for large
data sets. Different designing techniques have been used to design clustering
algorithms for large data sets. External memory algorithms are one class of
algorithms which can be used for large data sets. These algorithms exploit the
hierarchical memory structure of the computers by incorporating locality of
reference directly in the algorithm. This paper makes some contribution towards
designing clustering algorithms in the external memory model (Proposed by
Aggarwal and Vitter 1988) to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, it is
shown that the Shared near neighbors algorithm is not very I/O efficient since
the computational complexity is same as the I/O complexity. The algorithm is
designed in the external memory model and I/O complexity is reduced. The
computational complexity remains same. We substantiate the theoretical analysis

structure of this nanomachine, which drives locomotion in a wide range of
bacterial species, is more dynamic than previously believed. Specifically, the
number of active torque-generating units (stators) was shown to vary across
applied loads. This finding invalidates the experimental evidence reporting
that limiting (zero-torque) speed is independent of the number of active
stators. Here, we propose that, contrary to previous assumptions, the maximum
speed of the motor is not universal, but rather increases as additional
torque-generators are recruited. This result arises from our assumption that
stators disengage from the motor for a significant portion of their
mechanochemical cycles at low loads. We show that this assumption is consistent
with current experimental evidence and consolidate our predictions with
arguments that a processive motor must have a high duty ratio at high loads.

up to $2$ V/cm. The Poynting fluxes range from $[-0.6$ to $2.3]\times10^{10}$
ergs$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, mostly positive, with the largest contribution to
the energy budget in the range of $[10^9$-$10^{10}]$
ergs$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. Integrating the instantaneous energy flux over
space and time, we find that the total magnetic energy accumulated above the
photosphere from the initial emergence to the moment before the X2.2 flare to
be $E=10.6\times10^{32}$ ergs, which is partitioned as $2.0$ and

ubiquitous visible lights, which are necessarily and densely deployed in almost
all indoor environments. We unveil two phenomena of lights available for
positioning: 1) the light strength varies according to different light sources,
which can be easily detected by light sensors embedded in COTS devices (e.g.,
smart-phone, smart-glass and smart-watch); 2) the light strength is stable in
different times of the day thus exploiting it can avoid frequent site-survey
and database maintenance. Hence, a user could locate oneself by differentiating
the light source of received light strength (RLS). However, different from
existing positioning systems that exploit special LEDs, ubiquitous visible
lights lack fingerprints that can uniquely identify the light source, which
results in an ambiguity problem that an RLS may correspond to multiple
positions. Moreover, RLS is not only determined by device's position, but also
seriously affected by its orientation, which causes great complexity in
site-survey. To address these challenges, we first propose and validate a
realistic light strength model that can attributes RLS to arbitrary positions
with heterogenous orientations. This model is further perfected by taking
account of the device diversity, influence of multiple light sources and
shading of obstacles. Then we design a localizing scheme that harness user's
mobility to generate spatial-related RLS to tackle the position-ambiguity
problem of a single RLS, which is robust against sunlight interference, shading
effect of human-body and unpredictable behaviours (e.g., put the device in
pocket) of user. Experiment results show that our scheme achieves mean accuracy
$1.93$m and $1.98$m in office ($720m^2$) and library scenario ($960m^2$)

the CMB spectrum at large scales, which, though not yet statistically
significant, persists from WMAP to Planck data. Proposals that invoke some form
of initial condition for the inflation have been made to address this apparent
power suppression, albeit with conflicting conclusions. By studying the
curvature perturbations of a scalar field in the FLRW universe parameterized by
the equation of state parameter $w$, we find that the large-scale spectrum at
the end of inflation reflects the super-horizon spectrum of the initial state.
The large-scale spectrum is suppressed if the universe begins with the
adiabatic vacuum in a super-inflation ($w < -1$) or positive-pressure ($w > 0$)
era. In the latter case, there is however no causal mechanism to establish the
initial adiabatic vacuum. On the other hand, as long as the universe begins
with the adiabatic vacuum in an era with $-1 < w < 0$, even if there exists an
intermediate positive-pressure era, the large-scale spectrum would be enhanced
rather than suppressed. We further calculate the spectrum of a two-stage
inflation model with a two-field potential and show that the result agrees with
that obtained from the ad hoc single-field analysis.

$\gamma$-ray line at 1157 keV from the $^{44}$Ti decay chain, at a combined
significance of 3.8 $\sigma$. Measured fluxes are
$(2.1\pm0.4)~10^{-5}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and
$(3.5\pm1.2)~10^{-5}~\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, which corresponds to
$(1.5\pm0.4)~10^{-4}$ and $(2.4\pm0.9)~10^{-4}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ of
$^{44}$Ti, respectively. The measured Doppler broadening of the lines implies
expansion velocities of $4300$ and $2200~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, respectively.
Combining our results with previous studies, we determine a more precise
estimate of ejected $^{44}$Ti of $(1.37\pm0.19)~10^{-4}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.
The measurements of both lines are consistent with previous studies. The flux
in the line originating from excited $^{44}$Ca is significantly higher than the

path-symmetric entangled states
$|\varphi\rangle|0\rangle+|0\rangle|\varphi\rangle$, where an arbitrary state
$|\varphi\rangle$ occupies one of two modes in quantum superposition. This
class of states includes the previously considered states, i.e. $NOON$ states
and entangled coherent states, as special cases. With its generalization, we
identify the practical limit of phase estimation under energy constraint that
is characterized by the photon statistics of the component state
$|\varphi\rangle$. We first show that quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) can be
lowered with super-Poissonianity of the state $|\varphi\rangle$. By introducing
a component state of the form
$|\varphi\rangle=\sqrt{q}|1\rangle+\sqrt{1-q}|N\rangle$, we particularly show
that an arbitrarily small QCRB can be achieved even with a finite energy in an
ideal situation. For practical measurement schemes, we consider a parity
measurement and a full photon-counting method to obtain phase-sensitivity.
Without photon loss, the latter scheme employing any path-symmetric states
$|\varphi\rangle|0\rangle+|0\rangle|\varphi\rangle$ achieves the QCRB over the
entire range $[0,2\pi]$ of unknown phase shift $\phi$ whereas the former does
so in a certain confined range of $\phi$. We find that the case of
$|\varphi\rangle=\sqrt{q}|1\rangle+\sqrt{1-q}|N\rangle$ provides the most
robust resource against loss among the considered entangled states over the
whole range of input energy. Finally we also propose experimental schemes to
generate these path-symmetric entangled states.

of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC), we derive a new near-infrared
period-luminosity-metallicity (${\rm PL_{K_{\rm s}}Z}$) relation for RR Lyrae
variables. In order to fit the relation we use a fitting method developed
specifically for this study. The zero-point of the relation is estimated in two
different ways: by assuming the value of the distance to the LMC and by using
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) parallaxes of five RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way
(MW). The difference in distance moduli derived by applying these two
approaches is $\sim0.2$ mag. To investigate this point further we derive the
${\rm PL_{K_{\rm s}}Z}$ relation based on 23 MW RR Lyrae stars which had been
analysed in Baade-Wesselink studies. We compared the derived ${\rm PL_{K_{\rm
s}}Z}$ relations for RR Lyrae stars in the MW and LMC. Slopes and zero-points
are different, but still consistent within the errors. The shallow slope of the
metallicity term is confirmed by both LMC and MW variables.
  The astrometric space mission Gaia is expected to provide a huge contribution
to the determination of the RR Lyrae ${\rm PL_{K_{\rm s}}Z}$ relation, however,
calculating an absolute magnitude from the trigonometric parallax of each star
and fitting a ${\rm PL_{K_{\rm s}}Z}$ relation directly to period and absolute
magnitude leads to biased results. We present a tool to achieve an unbiased
solution by modelling the data and inferring the slope and zero-point of the
relation via statistical methods.

  In this work we define two procedures, E and Q, which generate a particular
type of extensions and quotients of $2$--Cayley digraphs, respectively. These
procedures are used to obtain optimal quotients and extensions. Quotients
obtained by procedure Q of optimal $2$--Cayley digraphs are proved to be also

allow the obtention of new optimal families of $2$--Cayley digraphs and also
the improvement of the diameter of many proposals in the literature.

processes. Here we show that two distinct types of localization of the

networks with degree distribution $P(q) \sim q^{-\gamma}$, localization occurs
on the largest hub if $\gamma>5/2$; for $\gamma<5/2$ a new type of localization

anisotropy may reach values of up to $1\,\mu$K. The key features of the
considered effect are as follow: (i) an observation of the effect does not
require absolute calibration; (ii) patches of sky with minimal foreground
contamination can be chosen. Future measurements of the CMB dipole distortion
thus will provide an alternative method for direct detection of the PRR-, $y$-,
and $\mu$-distortions. The $y$-distortion dipole may be detectable with PIXIE
at a few standard deviations.

where steep concentration gradients give rise to diffusive currents that are of

formalism for computing (1) the ion concentration dynamics and (2) the

formalism to explore the effects that diffusive currents can have on the
extracellular (ECS) potential surrounding a small population of active cortical
neurons. Our key findings are: (i) Sustained periods of neuronal output
(simulations were run for 84 s) could change local ECS ion concentrations by
several mM, as observed experimentally. (ii) For large, but realistic,
concentration gradients, diffusive currents in the ECS were of the same
magnitude as Ohmic currents. (iii) Neuronal current sources could induce local
changes in the ECS potential by a few mV, whereas diffusive currents could
could induce local changes in the ECS potential by a few tens of a mV.
Diffusive currents could thus have a quite significant impact on ECS
potentials. (v) Potential variations caused by diffusive currents were quite
slow, but could influence the comparable to those induced by Ohmic currents up

astrophysical conditions. However, this emission can be affected by line
absorption from Li-like ions in the same medium. We investigate this absorption
of He-like triplets and present the implications for diagnostics of plasmas in
photoionisation equilibrium using the line ratios of the triplets. Our
computations were carried out for the O VI and Fe XXIV absorption of the O VII
and Fe XXV triplet emission lines, respectively. The fluorescent emission by
the Li-like ions and continuum absorption of the He-like ion triplet lines are
also investigated. We determine the absorption of the triplet lines as a
function of Li-like ion column density and velocity dispersion of the emitting
and absorbing medium. We find O VI line absorption can significantly alter the
O VII triplet line ratios in optically-thin plasmas, by primarily absorbing the
intercombination lines, and to a lesser extent, the forbidden line. Because of
intrinsic line absorption by O VI inside a photoionised plasma, the predicted
ratio of forbidden to intercombination line intensity for the O VII triplet
increases from 4 up to an upper limit of 16. This process can explain the
triplet line ratios that are higher than expected and that are seen in some
X-ray observations of photoionised plasmas. For the Fe XXV triplet, line
absorption by Fe XXIV becomes less apparent owing to significant fluorescent
emission by Fe XXIV. Without taking the associated Li-like ion line absorption
into account, the density diagnosis of photoionised plasmas using the observed
line ratios of the He-like ion triplet emission lines can be unreliable,
especially for low-Z ions.

microlensing light curve, we derived the binary lens separation in Einstein
radius units (s~1.13) and a mass ratio of (4.732+/-0.020)x10^{-2}. Annual
parallax, lens orbital motion and finite source effects were included in the
models. To recover the lens system's physical parameters, we combined the
resulting light curve best-fit parameters with (J,H,Ks) magnitudes obtained
with VLT NaCo and calibrated using IRSF and 2MASS data. We derived a lens total
mass of 0.86+/-0.04 Msun and a lens distance of 4.2+/-0.3 kpc. We find that the
companion of MOA-2007-BLG-197L is a brown dwarf of 41+/-2 Mjup observed at a
projected separation of 4.3+/-0.1 AU, and orbits a 0.82+/-0.04 Msun G-K dwarf
star. We study the statistical properties of this population of brown dwarfs
detected by microlensing, transit, radial velocity, and direct imaging (most of
these objects orbit solar-type stars), and we performed a two-dimensional,
non-parametric probability density distribution fit to the data, which draws a
structured brown dwarf landscape. We confirm the existence of a region that is
strongly depleted in objects at short periods and intermediate masses (P<30 d,
M~30-60 Mjup), but also find an accumulation of objects around P~500 d and M~20
Mjup, as well as another depletion region at long orbital periods (P>500 d) and
high masses (M>50 Mjup). While these data provide important clues on mechanisms
of brown dwarfs formation, more data are needed to establish their relative
importance, in particular as a function of host star mass.

type II superstring theory in double space framework. We use the ghost free
action of type II superstring in pure spinor formulation in approximation of
constant background fields up to the quadratic terms. T-dualization along any
subset of the initial coordinates, $x^a$, is equivalent to the permutation of
this subset with subset of the corresponding T-dual coordinates, $y_a$, in
double space coordinate $Z^M=(x^\mu,y_\mu)$. Demanding that the T-dual
transformation law after exchange $x^a\leftrightarrow y_a$ has the same form as
initial one, we obtain the T-dual NS-NS and NS-R background fields. The T-dual
R-R field strength is determined up to one arbitrary constant under some
assumptions. The compatibility between supersymmetry and T-duality produces
change of bar spinors and R-R field strength. If we dualize odd number of
dimensions $x^a$, such change flips type IIA/B to type II B/A. If we T-dualize
time-like direction, one imaginary unit $i$ maps type II superstring theories
to type $II^\star$ ones.

detector located in Europe. Its design will be different from currently build
interferometers, because ET will consist of three interferometers rotated by a
60 deg with respect to each other in one plane. One of the biggest challenges
for ET will be to determine sky position and distance to observed sources. If
an object is observed in a few interferometers simultaneously one can estimate
the position using traingulation from time delays, but so far there are no
plans for a network of third generation detectors. Another possibility to deal
with that problem is by using multimessenger approach, because redshift and sky
position could be recovered from electromagnetic observations. In this paper we
present a novel method of estimating distance and position in the sky of
merging binaries. While our procedure is not as accurate as the multimessenger
method, it can be applied to all observations, not just the ones with
electromagnetic counterparts. We have shown that it is possible to
significantly improve distance estimates using the measurements of the signal
to noise ratio from all three interferometers .

abundance in Hyades cluster which is younger than the Sun, it is suggested that
half of the observed stars are younger than Hyades cluster. The measured value
of $v \sin i$ (projected rotational velocity) supports those objects are
younger than the Sun. However, there are some objects which show the low Li
abundance and slowly rotate on the basis of the estimated $v \sin i$ and $P$
(period of brightness variation). This result indicates that the superflare
stars are not only young stars but also old stars like our Sun. In our

solving the truncated perfectly matched layer (PML) approximation in bounded
domain of Helmholtz scattering problem. The method is a modification of the
STDDM proposed by [Z. Chen and X. Xiang, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp.
2331--2356]. After decomposing the domain into $N$ non-overlapping layers, the
STDDM is composed of two series steps of sources transfers and wave expansions,
where $N-1$ truncated PML problems on two adjacent layers and $N-2$ truncated
half-space PML problems are solved successively. While the PSTDDM consists
merely of two parallel source transfer steps in two opposite directions, and in
each step $N-1$ truncated PML problems on two adjacent layers are solved
successively. One benefit of such a modification is that the truncated PML
problems on two adjacent layers can be further solved by the PSTDDM along
directions parallel to the layers. And therefore, we obtain a block-wise PSTDDM
on the decomposition composed of $N^2$ squares, which reduces the size of
subdomain problems and is more suitable for large-scale problems. Convergences
of both the layer-wise PSTDDM and the block-wise PSTDDM are proved for the case
of constant wave number. Numerical examples are included to show that the
PSTDDM gives good approximations to the discrete Helmholtz equations with
constant wave numbers and can be used as an efficient preconditioner in the
preconditioned GMRES method for solving the discrete Helmholtz equations with
constant and heterogeneous wave numbers.

$x_B(k)$'s represents the position at step $k$ of a random walk `bridge' of $n$
steps that starts and ends at the origin. At each step, the increment of the
position is a random jump drawn from a specified symmetric distribution. We
study the statistics of records and record ages for such a bridge sequence, for
different jump distributions. In absence of the bridge condition, i.e., for a
free random walk sequence, the statistics of the number and ages of records
exhibits a `strong' universality for all $n$, i.e., they are completely
independent of the jump distribution as long as the distribution is continuous.
We show that the presence of the bridge constraint destroys this strong `all
$n$' universality. Nevertheless a `weaker' universality still remains for large
$n$, where we show that the record statistics depends on the jump distributions
only through a single parameter $0<\mu\le 2$, known as the L\'evy index of the
walk, but are insensitive to the other details of the jump distribution. We
derive the most general results (for arbitrary jump distributions) wherever
possible and also present two exactly solvable cases. We present numerical
simulations that verify our analytical results.

states in quantum critical systems via LOCC and propose an novel method to
reveal the different convertibility via majorization relation when a quantum
phase transition occurs. The ground-state local convertibility in the
one-dimensional transverse field Ising model is studied. It is shown that the
LOCC convertibility changes nearly at the phase transition point. The relation
between the order of quantum phase transitions and the LOCC convertibility is
discussed. Our results are compared with the corresponding results using the
Renyi entropy and the LOCC convertibility with assisted entanglement.

including the one-loop threshold corrections to SM gauge and Yukawa couplings

parameters entering all loop calculations, (ii) including the full momentum
dependence at one-loop, and (iii) including all two-loop corrections but the
ones involving $g_1$ and $g_2$. We find that the additional threshold
corrections are very important and can give the largest effect on the Higgs
mass. However, we identify also parameter regions where the new two-loop
effects can be more important than the ones of the MSSM and change the Higgs
mass prediction by up to 10 GeV. This is for instance the case in the low
$\tan\beta$, small $M_A$ regime. We use these results to calculate the
electroweak fine-tuning of an UV complete variant of this model. For this

the first loading, the material undergoes spontaneous plastic deformation under
the action of the capillary forces, requiring no external load. Plastic
deformation under compressive load is accompanied by dislocation storage and
dislocation interaction, along with strong strain hardening.

stiffness increases during deformation, but never approaches the prediction by
the relevant Gibson-Ashby scaling law. Microstructural disorder affects the

dispersion are included. Both the feedback and optimal control problems are
studied. We prove that we can control arbitrary nontrivial steady states of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, including travelling wave solutions, using a
finite number of point actuators. The number of point actuators needed is
related to the number of unstable modes of the equation. Furthermore, the
proposed control methodology is shown to be robust with respect to changing the
parameters in the equation, e.g. the viscosity coefficient or the intensity of
the electric field. We also study the problem of controlling solutions of
coupled systems of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. Possible applications to
controlling thin film flows are discussed. Our rigorous results are supported
by extensive numerical simulations.

  oscillations in main-sequence and sub-giant stars","11 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale analyses of stellar samples comprised of cool, solar-like
oscillators now commonly utilize the so-called asteroseismic scaling relations
to estimate fundamental stellar properties. In this paper we present a test of
the scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter $\nu_{\rm max}$,
the frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observed
pulsation amplitude. The classic relation assumes that this characteristic
frequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effective
temperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency for
acoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e., $\nu_{\rm max} \propto
gT_{\rm eff}^{-1/2}$. We test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequence
and sub-giant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismic
targets observed by the NASA \emph{Kepler} Mission. Our results, which come
from a grid-based analysis, rule out departures from the classic $gT_{\rm
eff}^{-1/2}$ scaling dependence at the level of $\simeq 1.5\,\rm per cent$ over
the full $\simeq 1560\,\rm K$ range in $T_{\rm eff}$ that we tested. There is
some uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the scaling. However, any
variation with $T_{\rm eff}$ is evidently small, with limits similar to those
above.

the injected spectrum must be very hard ($\alpha\simeq 1$) in order to fit the

difficult to accommodate theoretically. In contrast, much softer spectral
indices, consistent with the predictions of Fermi acceleration ($\alpha\simeq

theoretical bias, these observations thus favor models in which the sources of
the highest energy cosmic rays are preferentially located within the
low-redshift universe.

semi-analytical model we studied galaxy population properties in clusters and
groups, spanning over 10 different bands from UV to NIR, and their evolution
since redshift z=2. We compare our results in terms of galaxy red/blue
fractions and luminous-to-faint ratio (LFR) on the Red Sequence (RS) with
recent observational data reaching beyond z=1.5. Different selection criteria
were tested in order to retrieve galaxies belonging to the RS: either by their
quiescence degree measured from their specific SFR (""Dead Sequence""), or by
their position in a colour-colour plane which is also a function of sSFR. In
both cases, the colour cut and the limiting magnitude threshold were let
evolving with redshift, in order to follow the natural shift of the
characteristic luminosity in the LF.
  We find that the Butcher-Oemler effect is wavelength-dependent, with the
fraction of blue galaxies increasing steeper in optical colours than in NIR.
Besides, only when applying a lower limit in terms of fixed absolute magnitude,
a steep BO effect can be reproduced, while the blue fraction results less
evolving when selecting samples by stellar mass or an evolving magnitude limit.
We then find that also the RS-LFR behaviour, highly debated in the literature,
is strongly dependent on the galaxy selection function: in particular its very
mild evolution recovered when measured in terms of stellar mass, is in
agreement with values reported for some of the highest redshift confirmed
(proto)clusters. As to differences through environments, we find that normal
groups and (to a lesser extent) cluster outskirts present the highest values of
both star forming fraction and LFR at low z, while fossil groups and cluster
cores the lowest: this separation among groups begins after z~0.5, while
earlier all group star forming properties are undistinguishable.

demonstrate how to achieve electron localization and induce energy level
oscillation in one-dimensional quantum systems by externally controlling the
deformation of the system. From a practical point of view, the one-dimensional
potentials can be realized using layered structures. In the analysis, we
considered three different examples. The first one is a graded quantum well
between confining infinite walls where the deformation is modeled by varying
slightly the graded well. The second systems is a symmetric multiple quantum
well between infinite walls under the effect of biasing voltage. The third
system is a layered 2D hybrid perovskites where pressure is used to induce
deformation. The calculations are conducted both numerically and analytically
using the perturbation theory. It is shown that the obtained oscillations are
associated with level avoided crossings and that the deformation results in
changing the spatial localization of the electrons.

However, Si structures grown on a supporting substrate can show properties that

grown on Ag(111) strongly depend on film thickness, where the electron phase
coherence length decreases and the free-electron-like surface state gradually
diminishes when approaching the interface. These features are presumably
attributable to the inelastic inter-band electron-electron scattering
originating from the overlap between the surface state, interface state and the
bulk state of the substrate. We further demonstrate that the intrinsic

identical to that of the ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$)R$30^{\circ}$ reconstructed

the essential role of interfacial coupling on the properties of two-dimensional

standard diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and flexibility

spirit of the tremendous works of L. Escauriaza, G. Seregin, and V.
$\breve{\mathrm{S}}$ver$\acute{\mathrm{a}}$k and I. Gallagher, G. Koch, F.
Planchon, where they proved there is no blowing-up solution which remain
bounded in $L^3(R^3)$. The main idea is that if such blowing-up solutions
exist, they satisfy critical properties.

Indeed, performing a suitable scheme of the barycenter technique of Bahri-Coron
via the Chen's bubbles, we solve the cases left open after the work of Chen.
Thus, combining our work with the ones of Almaraz, Chen, Escobar and Marques we
have that every compact Riemannian manifold with boundary of dimension greater

excellent alternative to a traditional approach of obtaining specific
information by direct (through phone) or indirect (IVRS, Web, Email) probing.
Information and communication technology and far reaching mobile penetration
has opened this new research trend Number of key players in Search industry
including Microsoft and Google are attracted by the expected increase in volume
of use of such applications. The wide range of applications and their public
acceptance has motivated researchers to work in this research domain. Several
applications such as SMS based information access using database management
services, SMS based information retrieval through internet (search engine), SMS
based information extraction, question answering, image retrieval etc. have
been emerged. With the aim to understand the functionality involved in these
systems, an extensive review of a few of these SMSbISs has been planned and
executed by us. These systems are classified into four categories based on the
objectives and domains of the applications. As a result of this study a well
structured functional model is presented here. The model is evaluated in
different dimensions, which is presented in this paper. In addition to this a
chronological progress with respect to research and development in this
upcoming field is compiled in this paper. Such an extensive review presented in
this paper would definitely help the researchers and developers to understand
the technical aspects of this field. The functional framework presented here
would be useful to the system designers to design and develop an SMS based
Information System of any specific domain.

deformed by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) containing a linear

measurable length scale, this GUP is also consistent with doubly special
relativity and hence with the existence of maximum measurable momentum. We use
this deformed scalar field theory to analyze the tensor and scalar mode
equations in a de Sitter background, and to calculate modifications to the
tensor-to-scalar ratio. Finally, we compare our results for the
tensor-to-scalar ratio with the Planck data to constrain the minimum length
parameter in the GUP.

gravity's rainbow. We will demonstrate that the position of the horizon for a
particle inside the black hole depends on the energy of that particle. It will
also be observe that the position of the horizon for a particle falling
radially into the black hole also depends on its energy. Thus, it is possible
for a particle coming from outside to interact with a particle inside the
black, and take some information outside the black hole. This is because for
both these particles the position of horizon is different. So, even though the
particle from inside the black hole is in its own horizon, it is not in the
horizon of the particle coming from outside. Thus, we will demonstrate that in
gravity's rainbow information can get out of a black hole.

Newtonian equations in physics. Accordingly, each solution of the general
equilibrium equations can be regarded as a possible microstate of the economic
system. Since Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and Rawls' principle of social
fairness will provide a powerful support for the hypothesis of equal
probability, then the principle of maximum entropy is available in a just and
equilibrium economy so that an income distribution will occur spontaneously
(with the largest probability). Remarkably, some scholars have observed such an
income distribution in some democratic countries, e.g. USA. This result implies
that the hypothesis of equal probability may be only suitable for some ""fair""
systems (economic or physical systems). From this meaning, the non-equilibrium
systems may be ""unfair"" so that the hypothesis of equal probability is
unavailable.
