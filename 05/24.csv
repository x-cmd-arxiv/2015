discuss how P-values are widely abused in null hypothesis significance testing
. We agree completely with them and in this short comment we discuss the
importance of sample homogeneity tests. No matter with how much scrutiny data
are gathered if homogeneity tests are not performed the significance tests
suffer from sample homogeneity loophole and the results may not be trusted. For
example sample homogeneity loophole was not closed in the experiment testing
local realism in which a significant violation of Eberhard inequality was
found. We are not surprised that Bell type inequalities are violated since if
the contextual character of quantum observables is properly taken into account
these inequalities cannot be proven. However in order to trust the significance
of the violation sample homogeneity loophole must be closed. Therefore we
repeat after Jeffrey T.Leek and Roger D.Peng that sample homogeneity loophole
is probably just the tip of the iceberg.

ubiquitous in biological networks, including neural, metabolic, ecological, and
genetic regulatory networks, and in human-made systems, such as large
organizations and the Internet. To date, most research on hierarchy in networks
has been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important
question in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in
the first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of
the presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether
such connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such
modules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a
connection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a
hierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be
both modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall
performance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments).
Additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability
after controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same
force--the cost of connections--promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and
modularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network
performance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of
hierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also
accelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent
computational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

contains fundamental nuclear structure information and is at present relatively
poorly known.
  Purpose: We explore if parity violating elastic electron scattering can
provide a feasible and model independent way to determine not just the neutron
radius but the full radial shape of the neutron density $\rho_n(r)$ and the
weak charge density $\rho_W(r)$ of a nucleus.
  Methods: We expand the weak charge density of $^{48}$Ca in a model
independent Fourier Bessel series and calculate the statistical errors in the
individual coefficients that might be obtainable in a model parity violating
electron scattering experiment.
  Results: We find that it is feasible to determine roughly six Fourier Bessel
coefficients of the weak charge density of 48Ca within a reasonable amount of
beam time. However, it would likely be much harder to determine the full weak
density of a significantly heavier nucleus such as 208Pb.
  Conclusions: Parity violating elastic electron scattering can determine the
full weak charge density of a medium mass nucleus in a model independent way.
This weak density contains fundamental information on the size, surface
thickness, shell oscillations, and saturation density of the neutron
distribution in a nucleus. The measured $\rho_W(r)$, combined with the
previously known charge density $\rho_{ch}(r)$, will literally provide a
detailed textbook picture of where the neutrons and protons are located in an

show that this low value leaves essentially no room for an early partial
reionisation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) by high-redshift Population III
(Pop III) stars, expected to have formed in low-mass minihaloes. We perform
semi-analytic calculations of reionisation which include the contribution from
Pop II stars in atomic cooling haloes, calibrated with high-redshift galaxy
observations, and Pop III stars in minihaloes with feedback due to Lyman-Werner
(LW) radiation and metal enrichment. We find that without LW feedback or prompt
metal enrichment (and assuming a minihalo escape fraction of 0.5) the Pop III
star formation efficiency cannot exceed $\sim{\rm a~few}\times 10^{-4}$,
without violating the constraints set by Planck data. This excludes massive Pop
III star formation in typical $10^6 M_\odot$ minihaloes. Including LW feedback
and metal enrichment alleviates this tension, allowing large Pop III stars to
form early on before they are quenched by feedback. We find that the total
density of Pop III stars formed across cosmic time is $\lesssim
10^{4-5}~M_\odot~{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ and does not depend strongly on the feedback
prescription adopted. Additionally, we perform a simple estimate of the
possible impact on reionisation of X-rays produced by accretion onto black hole

low ($\lesssim 0.01$), this could lead to an optical depth inconsistent with

either $\text{poly}\log n $ queries or an exponential sized alphabet, i.e. of

  Our result can be phrased as a polynomial-gap hardness for approximate CSPs

The ultimate goal, in this direction, would be to prove polynomial hardness for

  Our construction is based on a modular generalization of previous PCP

that uses an extra `consistency' query but maintains the inverse polynomial
relation between the soundness error and the alphabet size.

intelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech

introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number
of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the
concept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence
perceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a
priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative
process of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We
call this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed
as an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application
can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three
facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making
and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how
open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed,
self-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is
scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination
and intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number
of questions for future research.

generations in the $H\to ZZ$ final states. Deviation of these couplings from
the Standard Model values leads to change in the Higgs boson width and in the
cross sections of relevant processes. In the Higgs boson resonance region, an
increased light Yukawa coupling leads to an increased Higgs boson width, which
in turn leads to a decreased cross section. In the off-shell region, increased
Yukawa couplings result in an enhancement of the Higgs boson signal through
$q\bar{q}$ annihilation. With the assumption of scaling one Yukawa coupling at
a time, this study is conceptually simple and yields results with the same
order of magnitude as the tightest in the literature. The study is based on
results published by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2014, corresponding to
integrated luminosities of $5.1\ifb$ at a centre-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s}=7\tev$ and $19.7\ifb$ at $8\tev$.

Syringe Based Extrusion (SBE), improving the build speed. A geometrical
decomposition of the screw extruder in a partially and a fully filled regions
(PFZ and FFZ) allows to describe the material convection in the extruder
chamber by a 1D hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) coupled with an
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). After solving the hyperbolic PDE by the
Method of Characteristics (MC), the coupled PDE-ODE's system is transformed
into a nonlinear state-dependent input delay system. The aforementioned delay
system is extended to the nonisothermal case with the consideration of periodic
fluctuations acting on the material's convection speed, which represent the
effect of viscosity variations due to temperature changes in the extruder
chamber, resulting to a nonlinear system with an input delay that
simultaneously depends on the state and the time variable. Global Exponential
Stability (GES) of the nonlinear delay-free plant is established under a
piecewise exponential feedback controller that is designed. By combining the
nominal, piecewise exponential feedback controller with nonlinear predictor
feedback the compensation of the time- and state-dependent input delay of the
extruder model is achieved. Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) of the
closed-loop system under the Bang-Bang predictor feedback control law is
established when certain conditions, which are easy to verify, related to the
extruder design and the material properties, as well as to the magnitude and
frequency of the materials transport speed variations, are satisfied.

compounds exhibiting strongly competing charge-density wave (CDW) and
superconducting (SC) order parameters (OPs). The weak van der Waals interlayer
bonding between hexagonal layers of octahedral or trigonal prismatic TMD
building blocks allows for many polytypes. The non-superconducting $1T$
polytypes can have one or more CDWs. The $2H$ polytypes have two or more Fermi
surfaces and saddle bands, allowing for dual orderings, which can be coexisting
CDW and SC orderings, two SC gaps as in MgB$_2$, or two CDW gaps. The CDW
transitions $T_{\rm CDW}$s usually greatly exceed the low superconducting
$T_{\rm c}$s, their orbital OPs are generally highly anisotropic and can even
contain nodes, are remarkably similar to the the high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprate
pseudogaps, and the SC OPs can be greatly affected by their presence. In
2$H$-NbSe$_2$, the CDW renders its general $s$-wave SC OP orbital symmetry to
be highly anisotropic and strongly reduces its Josephson coupling strength
($I_{\rm c}R_{\rm n}$) with Pb. Pressure and intercalation generally suppress
the CDWs, enhancing $T_{\rm c}$. The misfit intercalation compound
(LaSe)$_{1.14}$(NbSe$_2$) and many intercalated $2H$-TMDs, such as
TaS$_2$(pyridine)$_{1/2}$, have completely incoherent $c$-axis transport,
dimensional-crossover effects, and behave as stacks of intrinsic Josephson

consequence, the local computation can lead to estimation errors, which hinders
the increasing number of applications in the state of the art. Also, although
the divergence between the local and global ranks has been measured, the

mainly overlooked. These aspects are of great interest for online service

importance of their resources only based on their local knowledge, and (ii)
take into account real user browsing fluxes that better capture the actual user

also present an iterative training and testing algorithm that generates various

intriguing conjectures. The SCC conjecture addresses the issue of the nature of
the singularities found in most solutions of Einstein's gravitational field
equations: Are such singularities generically characterized by unbounded
curvature? Is the existence of a Cauchy horizon (and the accompanying
extensions into spacetime regions in which determinism fails) an unstable
feature of solutions of Einstein's equations? In this short review article,
after briefly commenting on the history of the SCC conjecture, we survey some
of the progress made in research directed either toward supporting SCC or
toward uncovering some of its weaknesses. We focus in particular on model
versions of SCC which have been proven for restricted families of spacetimes
(e.g., the Gowdy spacetimes), and the role played by the generic presence of
Asymptotically Velocity Term Dominated behavior in these solutions. We also
note recent work on spacetimes containing weak null singularities, and their
relevance for the SCC conjecture.

on the methodology of White et al. (1958) and Eriksson (1971). It applies Gibbs
free-energy minimization using an iterative, Lagrangian optimization scheme.
Given elemental abundances, TEA calculates molecular abundances for a
particular temperature and pressure or a list of temperature-pressure pairs. We
tested the code against the method of Burrows & Sharp (1999), the free
thermochemical equilibrium code CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications),
and the example given by White et al. (1958). Using their thermodynamic data,
TEA reproduces their final abundances, but with higher precision. We also
applied the TEA abundance calculations to models of several hot-Jupiter

of heavy Fermion superconductors (CeCu2Si2, UBe13, and UPt3 discovered in 1979,

costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples
recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be
efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and
regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised
and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To
our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been
studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain
Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier
by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift
compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of
the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the
unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for

high temperatures, air and even immersion in water.

of stars in detached eclipsing binary systems. We evaluate the precision of the
estimates due to the uncertainty in the observational constraints, and the
systematic bias caused by the uncertainty in convective core overshooting,
element diffusion, mixing-length value, and initial helium content. We adopted
the SCEPtER grid, which includes stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6] Msun
and evolutionary stages from the ZAMS to the central hydrogen depletion. Age
estimates have been obtained by a generalisation of the technique described in
our previous work. We showed that the typical 1 sigma random error in age
estimates - due to the uncertainty on the observational constraints - is about
+- 7%, which is nearly independent of the masses of the two stars. However,
such an error strongly depends on the evolutionary phase and becomes larger and
asymmetric for stars near the ZAMS where it ranges from about +90% to -25%. The
systematic bias due to the including mild and strong convective core
overshooting is about 50% and 120% of the error due to observational
uncertainties. A variation of +- 1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio
accounts for about +- 150% of the random error. The neglect of microscopic
diffusion accounts for a bias of about 60% of the random error. We also
introduced a statistical test of the expected difference in the recovered age
of two coeval stars in a binary system. We find that random fluctuations within
the current observational uncertainties can lead genuine coeval binary
components to appear to be non-coeval with a difference in age as high as 60%.

features of more modern data serialization, such as the Hierarchical Data

such as improved I/O speed and compression, but has yet to gain widespread
adoption within astronomy. One of the major holdbacks is that HDF5 is not well

present a comparison of FITS and HDF5 as a format for storage of astronomy

tool, fits2hdf, for converting between FITS and a new `HDFITS' format, where
data are stored in HDF5 in a FITS-like manner. We show that HDFITS allows
faster reading of data (up to 100x of FITS in some use cases), and improved
compression (higher compression ratios and higher throughput). Finally, we show

set that has been made available online, triggering a renaissance in
neuroanatomy. In particular, it has been used to define brain regions in a
computational, data-driven way, and to estimate the region-specificity of cell
types characterized independently by their transcriptional activity. However,
these results were based on one series of co-registered (coronal) ISH image
series per gene, whereas the online ABA contains several image series per
genes, including sagittal ones. Since the sagittal series cover mostly the left
hemisphere, we can simulate the variability of results by repeatedly drawing a
random image series for each gene and restricting the computation to the left
hemisphere. This gives rise to an estimate of error bars on the results of
computational neuroanatomy.

N-body simulation of structure formation in the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}{}$ model.
COCO follows an approximately spherical region of radius $\sim 17.4h^{-1}\,{\rm
Mpc}$ embedded in a much larger periodic cube that is followed at lower
resolution. The high resolution volume has a particle mass of
$1.135\times10^5h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ (60 times higher than the Millennium-II
simulation). COCO gives the dark matter halo mass function over eight orders of
magnitude in halo mass; it forms $\sim 60$ haloes of galactic size, each
resolved with about 10 million particles. We confirm the power-law character of
the subhalo mass function, $\bar{N}(>\mu)\propto\mu^{-s}$, down to a reduced
subhalo mass $M_{sub}/M_{200}\equiv\mu=10^{-6}$, with a best-fit power-law
index, $s=0.94$, for hosts of mass $\langle M_{200}\rangle=10^{12}h^{-1}{\rm
M}_{\odot}$. The concentration-mass relation of COCO haloes deviates from a
single power law for masses $M_{200}<\textrm{a few}\times 10^{8}h^{-1}{\rm
M}_{\odot}$, where it flattens, in agreement with results by Sanchez-Conde et
al. The host mass invariance of the reduced maximum circular velocity function
of subhaloes, $\nu\equiv V_{max}/V_{200}$, hinted at in previous simulations,
is clearly demonstrated over five orders of magnitude in host mass. Similarly,
we find that the average, normalised radial distribution of subhaloes is
approximately universal (i.e. independent of subhalo mass), as previously
suggested by the Aquarius simulations of individual haloes. Finally, we find
that at fixed physical subhalo size, subhaloes in lower mass hosts typically
have lower central densities than those in higher mass hosts.

the fundamental precision bound, the Holevo bound, for estimating any
two-parameter family of qubit mixed-states in terms of quantum versions of
Fisher information. The obtained formula depends solely on the symmetric
logarithmic derivative (SLD), the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher
information, and a given weight matrix. This result immediately provides
necessary and sufficient conditions for the following two important classes of
quantum statistical models; the Holevo bound coincides with the SLD Cramer-Rao
bound and it does with the RLD Cramer-Rao bound. One of the important results
of this paper is that a general model other than these two special cases
exhibits an unexpected property: The structure of the Holevo bound changes
smoothly when the weight matrix varies. In particular, it always coincides with
the RLD Cramer-Rao bound for a certain choice of the weight matrix. Several
examples illustrate these findings.

changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene
regulation that may not be apparent in expression data. We believe the ability
to generate sample-specific networks will greatly facilitate the application of
network methods to the increasingly large, complex, and heterogeneous

for $f(T)=T+\alpha T^{n}$, in the weak-field approximation and for spherical
symmetry spacetime. Since $f(T)=T$ corresponds to Teleparallel Gravity, which
is equivalent to General Relativity, the non linearity of the Lagrangian are
expected to produce perturbations of the general relativistic solutions,
parameterized by $\alpha$. Hence, we use the $f(T)$ solutions to model the
gravitational field of the Sun, and exploit data from accurate tracking of
spacecrafts orbiting Mercury and Saturn to infer preliminary insights on what
could be obtained about the model parameter $\alpha$ and the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$. It turns out that improvements of about one-three orders
with respect to the present-day constraints in the literature of magnitude seem
possible.

fields approximation for SU(3) non-Abelian Lagrangian. The approach to
approximation makes use of the assumption that 2 and 4-points Green's functions
are described in terms of some two scalar fields. The model is described via
non-perturbative method due to value of coupling constant, which does not
permit us using of Feynman diagrams and therefore of perturbative methods.
Asymptotical behaviour of the scalar fields are obtained. Profiles of these
fileds calculated for a range of values of a parameter of the problem is given.
Detailed numerical investigation of corresponding equations describing this
model is performed. The dependence of the glueball mass vs parameters of scalar
fields is shown. Comparison of characteristics of glueball obtained in our
two-scalar model and predictions of other models and experimental data for
glueball is performed.

rotation in $R^2$ are derived for the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo definitions.
These transformation properties link the observation of physical quantities,
expressed through fractional derivatives, with respect to different coordinate
systems (observers). It is the hope that such understanding could shed light on
the physical interpretation of fractional derivatives. Also it is necessary to
able to construct interaction terms that are invariant with respect to
equivalent observers.

$\#$ 1 in 1996 {\it Am. J. Phys.} {\bf 64} 812), a change of the rate of the
clock when it is set in uniform motion is calculated exactly, employing the
correct equation of motion of a charged particle in the electromagnetic field
and the universal boostability assumption. Thus, for the clock under
consideration, a dynamical content of the clock retardation is demonstrated.
Somewhat surprisingly, the analysis presented discloses that some familiar
relativistic generalisations concerning the retardation of clocks have to be
amended.
