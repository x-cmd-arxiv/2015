short and long GRBs, resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate of
X-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of GRB redshifts, and of the
identification of the underlying host galaxies. Nevertheless, our theoretical
understanding on the progenitors and central engines powering these vast
explosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of `ultra-long' GRBs
has fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of GRB formation. In
this paper we present high signal-to-noise X-shooter observations of the host
galaxy of GRB130925A, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-long
GRB, with prompt gamma-ray emission detected for ~20ks. The GRB line of sight
was close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations cover
both this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy, in addition to a bright
star-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. From our broad
wavelength coverage we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinction
measurements at both the galaxy nucleus, and an outer star-forming region, and
measure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy within
the 10-20% most metal-rich GRB host galaxies. Such a high metal enrichment has
implications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long GRBs,
although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to rule
out a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. The spatially
resolved spectroscopic data presented in this paper offer important insight
into variations in the metal and dust abundance within GRB host galaxies. They
also illustrate the need for IFU observations on a larger sample of GRB host
galaxies at varies metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on the
relation between the GRB circumburst and the galaxy-whole properties.

flows with a transonic shock past a curved wedge for the steady full Euler
equations in an important physical regime, which form a nonlinear system of
mixed-composite hyperbolic-elliptic type. To achieve this, we first employ the
coordinate transformation of Euler-Lagrange type and then exploit one of the
new equations to identify a potential function in Lagrangian coordinates. By
capturing the conservation properties of the Euler system, we derive a single
second-order nonlinear elliptic equation for the potential function in the
subsonic region so that the transonic shock problem is reformulated as a
one-phase free boundary problem for a second-order nonlinear elliptic equation
with the shock-front as a free boundary. One of the advantages of this approach
is that, given the shock location or quivalently the entropy function along the
shock-front downstream, all the physical variables can expressed as functions
of the gradient of the potential function, and the downstream asymptotic
behavior of the potential function at the infinite exit can be uniquely
determined with uniform decay rate.
  To solve the free boundary problem, we employ the hodograph transformation to
transfer the free boundary to a fixed boundary, while keeping the ellipticity
of the second-order equations, and then update the entropy function to prove
that it has a fixed point. Another advantage in our analysis here is in the
context of the real full Euler equations so that the solutions do not
necessarily obey Bernoulli's law with a uniform Bernoulli constant, that is,
the Bernoulli constant is allowed to change for different fluid trajectories.

for which the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) have been proposed to be the
candidate sources. Here we assume that the neutrino flux from FSRQs is
proportional to their gamma-ray ones, and obtain the gamma-ray/neutrino flux
ratio by the diffuse gamma-ray flux from Fermi-LAT measurement of FSRQs and the
diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We apply this ratio to individual
FSRQs and hence predict their neutrino flux. We find that a large fraction of
candidate FSRQs from the northern sky in the IceCube point source search has
predicted neutrino flux above the IceCube upper limit; and for the sample of
stacking search for neutrinos by IceCube, the predicted stacked flux is even
larger than the upper limit of stacked flux by orders of magnitude. Therefore
the IceCube limit from stacking searches, combined with the Fermi-LAT
observations, already rejects FSRQs as the main sources of IceCube-detected
diffuse neutrinos: FSRQs can only account for <10% (4%) of the IceCube-detected
diffuse neutrino flux, according to the stacking searches from the whole
(northern) sky. The derived neutrino/gamma-ray flux ratio is <<1, also implying
that the gamma-ray emission from FSRQs cannot be produced by the secondary
leptons and photons from the pion production processes. The caveat in the
assumptions is discussed.

(corresponding to two types of customers) and two orbits. The size of each
orbit is infinite. The exponential server (with a rate independent of the type
of customers) can hold at most one customer at a time and there is no waiting
room. Upon arrival, if a type $i$ customer $(i=1,2)$ finds a busy server, it
will join the type $i$ orbit. After an exponential time with a constant
(retrial) rate $\mu_i$, an type $i$ customer attempts to get service. This
model has been recently studied by Avrachenkov, Nain and
Yechiali~\cite{ANY2014} by solving a Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem.
One may notice that, this model is not a random walk in the quarter plane.
Instead, it can be viewed as a random walk in the quarter plane modulated by a
two-state Markov chain, or a two-dimensional quasi-birth-and-death (QBD)
process. The special structure of this chain allows us to deal with the
fundamental form corresponding to one state of the chain at a time, and
therefore it can be studied through a boundary value problem. Inspired by this
fact, in this paper, we focus on the tail asymptotic behaviour of the
stationary joint probability distribution of the two orbits with either an idle
or busy server by using the kernel method, a different one that does not
require a full determination of the unknown generating function. To take
advantage of existing literature results on the kernel method, we identify a
censored random walk, which is an usual walk in the quarter plane. This
technique can also be used for other random walks modulated by a finite-state
Markov chain with a similar structure property.

Multiword Expressions (MWEs) into parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar
(CCG). We build on previous work which has shown the benefit of adding
information about MWEs to syntactic parsing by implementing a similar pipeline
with CCG parsing. More specifically, we collapse MWEs to one token in training
and test data in CCGbank, a corpus which contains sentences annotated with CCG
derivations. Our collapsing algorithm however can only deal with MWEs when they
form a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach.
  We study the effect of collapsing training and test data. A parsing effect
can be obtained if collapsed data help the parser in its decisions and a
training effect can be obtained if training on the collapsed data improves
results. We also collapse the gold standard and show that our model
significantly outperforms the baseline model on our gold standard, which
indicates that there is a training effect. We show that the baseline model
performs significantly better on our gold standard when the data are collapsed
before parsing than when the data are collapsed after parsing which indicates
that there is a parsing effect. We show that these results can lead to improved
performance on the non-collapsed standard benchmark although we fail to show
that it does so significantly. We conclude that despite the limited settings,
there are noticeable improvements from using MWEs in parsing. We discuss ways
in which the incorporation of MWEs into parsing can be improved and hypothesize
that this will lead to more substantial results.
  We finally show that turning the MWE recognition part of the pipeline into an
experimental part is a useful thing to do as we obtain different results with
different recognizers.

forced compressible turbulence. In the inertial-convective range the scalar
spectrum followed the k^{-5/3} power law. For Sc >> 1, there appeared a k^{-1}
power law in the viscous-convective range, while for Sc << 1, a k^{-17/3} power
law was identified in the inertial-diffusive range. The scaling constant for
the mixed third-order structure function of velocity-scalar increment grew over
Sc, and the effect of compressibility made it smaller than the classical 4/3
value. At small amplitudes, the PDF of scalar fluctuations collapsed to the
Gaussian distribution, whereas at large amplitudes it decayed more quickly than
Gaussian. At large scales, the PDF of scalar increment behaved similarly to
that of scalar fluctuation, while at small scales it resembled the PDF of
scalar gradient. The scalar dissipation occurring at large magnitudes was found
to grow with Sc. Due to low molecular diffusivity, for Sc >> 1, the scalar
field rolled up and got mixed sufficiently. However, for Sc << 1, the scalar
field lost the small-scale structures by high molecular diffusivity, and
retained only the large-scale, cloudlike structures. The spectral densities of
scalar advection and dissipation in both Sc >> 1 and Sc << 1 flows followed the
k^{-5/3} scaling. This indicated that in compressible turbulence the processes
of advection and dissipation except that of scalar-dilatation coupling might
defer to the Kolmogorov picture. It then showed that at high wavenumbers, the
magnitudes of spectral coherency in both Sc >> 1 and Sc << 1 flows decayed
faster than the theoretical prediction of k^{-2/3} for incompressible flows.
Finally, the comparison with incompressible results showed that the scalar in
compressible turbulence with Sc=1 lacked a conspicuous bump structure in its
spectrum, but was more intermittent in the dissipative range.

a family of communication complexity problems parametrized by dimension of

for low dimensions, the two resources perform equally well, whereas for
dimension seven and above, the equivalence is suddenly broken and transmission

effects of hot halo gas on the evolution for a case with the mass ratio of the
ETG to LTG of 2:1 and the closest approach distance of $\sim$100 kpc. We find
that the dynamics of the cold disk gas in the tidal bridge and the amount of
the newly formed stars depend strongly on the existence of a gas halo. In the
run of interacting galaxies not having a hot gas halo, the gas and stars
accreted into the ETG do not include newly formed stars. However, in the run
using the ETG with a gas halo and the LTG without a gas halo, a shock forms
along the disk gas tidal bridge and induces star formation near the closest
approach. The shock front is parallel to a channel along which the cold gas
flows toward the center of the ETG. As a result, the ETG can accrete
star-forming cold gas and newly born stars at and near its center. When both
galaxies have hot gas halos, a shock is formed between the two gas halos
somewhat before the closest approach. The shock hinders the growth of the cold
gas bridge to the ETG and also ionizes it. Only some of the disk stars transfer

scanning tunneling microscope has been a very successful tool for studying not
only individual spins but also complex coupled systems. When these systems
interact with the electrons of the supporting substrate correlated manyparticle
states can emerge, making them ideal prototypical quantum systems. The spin
systems, which can be constructed by arranging individual atoms on appropriate
surfaces or embedded in synthesized molecular structures, can reveal very rich
spectral features. Up to now the spectral complexity has only been partly
described. This manuscript shows that perturbation theory enables one to
describe the tunneling transport, reproducing the differential conductance with
surprisingly high accuracy. Well established scattering models, which include
Kondo-like spin-spin and potential interactions, are expanded to enable
calculation of arbitrary complex spin systems in reasonable time scale and the
extraction of important physical properties. The emergence of correlations
between spins and, in particular, between the localized spins and the
supporting bath electrons are discussed and related to experimentally tunable
parameters. These results might stimulate new experiments by providing
experimentalists with an easily applicable modeling tool.

  structural synaptic plasticity",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theoretical models of neuronal function consider different mechanisms through
which networks learn, classify and discern inputs. A central focus of these
models is to understand how associations are established amongst neurons, in
order to predict spiking patterns that are compatible with empirical
observations. Although these models have led to major insights and advances,
they still do not account for the astonishing velocity with which the brain
solves certain problems and what lies behind its creativity, amongst others
features. We examine two important components that may crucially aid
comprehensive understanding of said neurodynamical processes. First, we argue
that once presented with a problem, different putative solutions are generated
in parallel by different groups or local neuronal complexes, with the
subsequent stabilization and spread of the best solutions. Using mathematical
models we show that this mechanism accelerates finding the right solutions.
This formalism is analogous to standard replicator-mutator models of evolution
where mutation is analogous to the probability of neuron state switching
(on/off). The second factor that we incorporate is structural synaptic
plasticity, i.e. the making of new and disbanding of old synapses, which we
apply as a dynamical reorganization of synaptic connections. We show that
Hebbian learning alone does not suffice to reach optimal solutions. However,
combining it with parallel evaluation and structural plasticity opens up
possibilities for efficient problem solving. In the resulting networks,
topologies converge to subsets of fully connected components. Imposing costs on
synapses reduces the connectivity, although the number of connected components
remains robust. The average lifetime of synapses is longer for connections that
are established early, and diminishes with synaptic cost.

out primordial black holes with masses $\sim 10^{19}$ gm - $10^{20}$ gm as a

constrained by the observed supernova rate, though these bounds are subject to

measurements of white dwarf binaries in gravitational wave observatories. The
mechanism proposed in this paper can constrain a variety of other dark matter
scenarios such as Q balls, annihilation/collision of large composite states of

to the formation of compact cores within the star. White dwarfs, with their

illuminates the fresh accretion flow. In this paper, we simulated the evolution
of the expected spectral line profile of iron due to such a flare by using a
ray-tracing code with effects of general relativity (GR) taken into account. We
found that the time-dependent profile changes significantly with black hole
spin, inclination angle with respect to the black-hole equatorial plane, and
the expansion velocity of the ionization front. At low values of spin, a ""loop""
feature appears in the line profile vs. time plot when the inclination is no
less than $30^\circ$ and the expansion velocity $v_{\rm exp}$ is no less than
half speed of light, due to a shadow in the emission of the truncated disk. In
the light curve two peaks occur depending on the inclination angle. At large

However, in systems far away from equilibrium a deeper understanding of its

identified. Besides the diffusive universality class with dynamical exponent
$z=2$ another prominent example is the superdiffusive Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)

by ratios of neighbouring Fibonacci numbers, starting with either $z_1=3/2$ (if

provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of foot points of the

average Doppler shift in the line profiles at specific instances which indicate
the presence of flows at the foot points of plumes. We propose that outflows
(jet-like features) as a result of small scale reconnections affect the line
profiles. These jet-like features may be also responsible for the generation of
propagating disturbances within the plumes which are observed to be propagating

given an image we want to detect people doing actions and localize the objects

task of action classification at the image or video clip level or at best
produce a bounding box around the person doing the action. We believe such an
output is inadequate and a complete understanding can only come when we are
able to associate objects in the scene to the different semantic roles of the
action. To enable progress towards this goal, we annotate a dataset of 16K

objects in the scene with different semantic roles for each action. Finally, we
provide a set of baseline algorithms for this task and analyze error modes

to play a key role in the acceleration of fast solar wind. The recent advent of
high-resolution instruments had brought us many new insights on the properties
of MHD waves in coronal holes which are reviewed in this article. The advances
made in the identification of compressive slow MHD waves in both polar and

Thermal
fluctuations of a 2D membrane tend to destroy the long-range order in the

preserve thermodynamic stability. The anharmonic effects demonstrate critical
behaviour on scales larger than the Ginzburg scale. In particular, clean
suspended flake of graphene shows a power-law increase of the bending rigidity
with the system size, $\varkappa\propto L^{\eta},$ due to anharmonic
interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane (flexural) phonon modes. We
demonstrate that random fluctuations of membrane curvature caused by static
disorder may change dramatically the scaling of the bending rigidity and lead
to a non-monotonous dependence of $\varkappa$ on $L.$ We derive coupled RG
describing combined flow of $\varkappa$ and effective disorder strength $b$,
find a critical curve $b(\varkappa)$ separating flat and crumpled phases, and
explore the behavior of disorder in the flat phase. Deep in the flat phase,
disorder decays in a power-law way at scales larger than the Ginzburg length
which therefore sets a characteristic size for the ripples--static out-of-plane
deformations observed experimentally in suspended graphene. We find that in the
limit $L \to \infty $ ripples are characterized by anomalous exponent $2\eta$
in contrast to dynamical fluctuations governed by $\eta$. For sufficiently
strong disorder, there exists an intermediate range of spatial scales where
ripples decay much slower, with exponent $\eta/4$. In the near-critical regime,
the membrane shows fractal properties implying a multiple folding starting from
a certain length scale $L_1$ and finally flattens at a much larger scale $L_2$

robust with respect to various complex dependence structures that frequently

field magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) are developed and tested. Chapter 2 is a
review of SPMHD. In Chapter 3, a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic scheme is developed
which cleans divergence error from the magnetic field. Average divergence error
is an order of magnitude lower for all test cases considered, and allows for
the stable simulation of the gravitational collapse of magnetised molecular
cloud cores. The effectiveness of the cleaning may be improved by explicitly
increasing the hyperbolic wave speed or by cycling the cleaning equations
between timesteps. In the latter, it is possible to achieve DivB=0. Chapter 4
develops a switch to reduce dissipation of the magnetic field from artificial
resistivity. Compared to the existing switch in the literature, this leads to
sharper shock profiles in shocktube tests, lower overall dissipation of
magnetic energy, and importantly, is able to capture magnetic shocks in the
highly super-Alfvenic regime. Chapter 5 compares these numerical methods
against grid-based MHD methods (using the Flash code) in simulations of the
small-scale dynamo amplification of a magnetic field in driven, isothermal,
supersonic turbulence. Both codes exponentially amplify the magnetic energy at
a constant rate, though SPMHD shows a resolution dependence that arises from
the scaling of the numerical dissipation terms. The time-averaged saturated
magnetic spectra have similar shape, and both codes have PDFs of magnetic field
strength that are log-normal, which become lopsided as the magnetic field

some cases. This represents a 60% increase in the number of variables known in
this field. Moreover, 30 of the previously identified variables are found to be
false positives resulting from time-dependent systematic effects. New catalog

damage of polycrystalline pure Ti, as well as modeling of the observed
behavior. From the mechanical characterization data, it can be concluded that
the material displays anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. As concerns
damage, the X-ray tomography measurements conducted reveal that damage
distribution and evolution in this HCP Ti material is markedly different than
in a typical FCC material such as copper. Stewart and Cazacu (2011) anisotropic
elastic/plastic damage model is used to describe the behavior. All material
parameters involved in this model have a clear physical significance, being
related to plastic properties, and are determined based on very few simple
mechanical tests. It is shown that this model predicts correctly the anisotropy
in plastic deformation, and its strong influence on damage distribution and
damage accumulation in Ti. Specifically, for a smooth axisymmetric specimen
subject to uniaxial tension, damage initiates at the center of the specimen and
is diffuse; the level of damage close to failure is very low. On the other
hand, for a notched specimen subject to the same loading, the model predicts
that damage initiates at the outer surface of the specimen, and further grows
from the outer surface to the center of the specimen, which corroborates with
the in-situ tomography data.

arises from their dynamic nature. In contrast to other forms of tracking, PTZ
tracking involves both locating the target in the image and controlling the
motors of the camera to aim it so that the target stays in its field of view.
This type of tracking can only be performed online. In this paper, we propose a
new evaluation framework based on a virtual PTZ camera. With this framework,
tracking scenarios do not change for each experiment and we are able to
replicate online PTZ camera control and behavior including camera positioning

However, the combination of directional emission and single-mode operation is
quite challenging, especially for the on-chip devices. Here we propose a
microdisk laser with single-mode operation and directional emissions by
exploiting the recent developments associated with parity-time (PT) symmetry.
This is accomplished by introducing one-dimensional periodic gain and loss into
a circular microdisk, which induces a coupling between whispering gallery modes
with different radial numbers. The lowest threshold mode is selected at the
positions with least initial wavelength difference. And the directional
emissions are formed by the introduction of additional grating vectors by the
periodic distribution of gain and loss regions. We believe this research will
impact the practical applications of on-chip microdisk lasers.

this observed rotational motion is not well understood. It has been shown
recently that a low-mass classical bulge (ClB) in a barred galaxy can acquire
rotation from absorbing a significant fraction of the angular momentum emitted
by the bar. Our aim here is to investigate whether bars can spin up also more
massive ClBs during the secular evolution of the bar, and to study the
kinematics and dynamics of these ClBs. We use a set of self-consistent N-body
simulations to study the interaction of ClBs with a bar that forms
self-consistently in the disk. We use orbital spectral analysis to investigate
the angular momentum gain by the classical bulge stars. We show that the ClBs
gain, on average, about 2 - 6% of the disk's initial angular momentum within
the bar region. Most of this angular momentum gain occurs via low-order
resonances, particularly 5:2 resonant orbits. A density wake forms in the ClB
which corotates and aligns with the bar at the end of the evolution. The
spin-up process creates a characteristic linear rotation profile and mild
tangential anisotropy in the ClB. The induced rotation is small in the centre
but significant beyond $\sim2$ bulge half mass radii, where it leads to
mass-weighted $V/\sigma \sim 0.2$, and reaches a local $V_{max}/\sigma_{in}
\sim 0.5$ at around the scale of the bar. The resulting $V/\sigma$ is tightly
correlated with the ratio of the bulge size to the bar size. In all models, a
box/peanut bulge forms suggesting that composite bulges may be common.
Bar-bulge resonant interaction in barred galaxies can provide some spin up of
massive ClBs, but the process appears to be less efficient than for low-mass
ClBs. Further angular momentum transfer due to nuclear bars or gas inflow would
be required to explain the observed rotation if it is not primordial.

an effectively quantum scheme. Based on such conditions, it is shown that the

sufficient to verify the entanglement of the output signal modes. The

three dimensional hole and electron Fermi surface (FS) pockets formed from
strongly renormalized bands with well-defined quasiparticles. Upon cooling
across the MIT in NNO/NGO sample, the quasiparticles lose coherence via a
spectral weight transfer from near the Fermi level to localized states forming
at higher binding energies. In the case of NNO/LAO, the bands are apparently
shifted upward with an additional holelike pocket forming at the corner of the
Brillouin zone. We find that the renormalization effects are strongly
anisotropic and are stronger in NNO/NGO than NNO/LAO. Our study reveals that
substrate-induced strain tunes the crystal field splitting, which changes the
FS properties, nesting conditions, and spin-fluctuation strength, and thereby
controls the MIT via the formation of an electronic order parameter with

  Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a well established method for qualitative as
well as probabilistic reliability and safety analysis. As a Boolean model it
does not support modelling of dynamic effects like sequence dependencies
between fault events. This work describes a method that allows consideration of
sequence dependencies without transformations into state-space.
  Concept:
  The new temporal fault tree analysis (TFTA) described in this work extends
the Boolean FTA. The TFTA is based on a new temporal logic which adds a concept
of time to the Boolean logic and algebra. This allows modelling of temporal
relationships between events using two new temporal operators (PAND and SAND).
With a set of temporal logic rules, a given temporal term may be simplified to
its temporal disjunctive normal form (TDNF) which is similar to the Boolean DNF
but includes event sequencies. In TDNF the top event's temporal system function
may be reduced to a list of minimal cutset sequences (MCSS). These allow
qualitative analyses similar to Boolean cutset analysis in normal FTA.
Furthermore the TFTA may also be used for probabilistic analyses without using
state-space models.
  Results:
  One significant aspect of the new TFTA described in this work is the
possibility to take sequence dependencies into account for qualitative and
probabilistic analyses without state-space transformations. Among others, this
allows for modelling of event sequencies at all levels within a fault tree, a
real qualitative analysis similar to the FTA's cutset analysis, and
quantification of sequence dependencies within the same model.

suffer Anderson localization, whereby the spread of the walker stays within a
finite region even in the infinite time limit. It is therefore important to
understand when we can expect a quantum walk to be Anderson localized and when
we can expect it to spread to infinity even in the presence of disorder. In
this work we analyze the response of a generic one-dimensional quantum walk --
the split-step walk -- to different forms of static disorder. We find that
introducing static, symmetry-preserving disorder in the parameters of the walk
leads to Anderson localization. In the completely disordered limit, however, a
delocalization sets in, and the walk spreads subdiffusively. Using an efficient
numerical algorithm, we calculate the bulk topological invariants of the
disordered walk, and interpret the disorder-induced Anderson localization and
delocalization transitions using these invariants.

in the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) wireless network model.
We first prove that efficient SINR implementations are not possible for the
standard absMAC specification. We modify that specification to an ""approximate""
version that better suits the SINR model. We give an efficient algorithm to
implement the modified specification, and use it to derive efficient algorithms
for higher-level problems of global broadcast and consensus.
  In particular, we show that the absMAC progress property has no efficient
implementation in terms of the SINR strong connectivity graph $G_{1-\epsilon}$,
which contains edges between nodes of distance at most $(1-\epsilon)$ times the
transmission range, where $\epsilon>0$ is a small constant that can be chosen
by the user. This progress property bounds the time until a node is guaranteed
to receive some message when at least one of its neighbors is transmitting.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce the slightly weaker notion of
approximate progress into the absMAC specification. We provide a fast
implementation of the modified specification, based on decomposing a known
algorithm into local and global parts. We analyze our algorithm in terms of
local parameters such as node degrees, rather than global parameters such as
the overall number of nodes. A key contribution is our demonstration that such
a local analysis is possible even in the presence of global interference.
  Our absMAC algorithm leads to several new, efficient algorithms for solving
higher-level problems in the SINR model. Namely, by combining our algorithm
with known high-level algorithms, we obtain an improved algorithm for global
single-message broadcast in the SINR model, and the first efficient algorithm
for multi-message broadcast in that model.

ferromagnetic contacts, placed at the edge of a two-dimensional electron system
with band inversion. The system is realized in a narrow (8~nm) HgTe quantum
well, the ferromagnetic side contacts are formed from a pre-magnetized
permalloy film. In zero magnetic field, we find a significant edge current
contribution to the transport between two ferromagnetic contacts. We
experimentally demonstrate that this transport is sensitive to the mutual
orientation of the magnetization directions of two 200~$\mu$m-spaced
ferromagnetic leads. This is a direct experimental evidence on the
spin-coherent edge transport over the macroscopic distances. Thus, the spin is
extremely robust at the edge of a two-dimensional electron system with band
inversion, confirming the helical spin-resolved nature of edge currents.

change in the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential occurs. These small
changes, known as a postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), are highly variable, and
current models assume that this variability is corrupting noise. In contrast,
we show that this variability could have an important computational role:
representing a synapse's uncertainty about the optimal synaptic weight (i.e.
the best possible setting for the synaptic weight). We show that this link
between uncertainty and variability, that we call synaptic sampling, leads to
more accurate estimates of the uncertainty in task relevant quantities, leading
to more effective decision making. Synaptic sampling makes four predictions,
all of which have some experimental support. First the more variable a synapse
is, the more it should change during LTP protocols. Second, variability should
increase as the presynpatic firing rate falls. Third, PSP variance should be
proportional to PSP mean. Fourth, variability should increase with distance
from the cell soma. We provide support for the first two predictions by
reanalysing existing datasets, and we find preexisting data in support of the
last two predictions.

necessary and sufficient condition for fully-synchronous robots to solve the

availability of local memory at robots. An implication of the result is
somewhat counter-intuitive: The robots cannot form a plane from most of the
semi-regular polyhedra, while they can form a plane from every regular
polyhedron (except a regular icosahedron), whose symmetry is usually considered
to be higher than any semi-regular polyhedrdon.

basic frameworks for collaboration prediction are considered with the circle

using the data. A two-step cluster analysis using IBM SPSS version 22 was

explore cluster membership. Indicator scores were contextualized using the

EuNiO$_3$ undergoes at ambient pressure a metal-to-insulator transition at
$T_{\rm MI}$ = 460 K which is associated with a simultaneous
orthorhombic-to-monoclinic distortion, leading to charge disproportionation. We
have investigated the change of the structural and magnetic properties of
EuNiO$_3$ with pressure (up to $\sim$ 20 GPa) across its quantum critical point
(QCP) using low-temperature synchrotron angle-resolved x-ray diffraction and
$^{151}$Eu nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron radiation, respectively.
With increasing pressure we find that after a small increase of $T_{\rm N}$
($p$ $\leq$ 2 GPa) and the induced magnetic hyperfine field $B_{\rm hf}$ at the
$^{151}$Eu nucleus ($p$ $\leq$ 9.7 GPa), both $T_{\rm N}$ and $B_{\rm hf}$ are
strongly reduced and finally disappear at $p_{\rm c}$ $\cong$ 10.5 GPa,
indicating a magnetic QCP at $p_{\rm c}$. The analysis of the structural
parameters up to 10.5 GPa reveals no change of the lattice symmetry within the
experimental resolution. Since the pressure-induced insulator-to-metal
transition occurs at $p_{\rm IM}$ $\cong$ 6 GPa, this result implies the
existence of an antiferromagnetic metallic state between 6 and 10.5 GPa. We
further show from the analysis of the reported high pressure electrical
resistance data on EuNiO$_3$ at low-temperatures that in the vicinity of the
QCP the system behaves as non-Fermi-liquid, with the resistance changing as
$T^{\rm n}$, with n=1.6, whereas it becomes a normal Fermi-liquid, n = 2, for
pressures above $\sim$15 GPa. On the basis of the obtained data a magnetic
phase diagram in the ($p$, $T$) space is suggested.

effects on the star light, or through its thermal emission at infrared
wavelengths. Recent radiative transfer studies of several nearby edge-on
galaxies have found an apparent inconsistency in the dust energy balance: the
radiative transfer models that successfully explain the optical extinction
underestimate the observed fluxes by an average factor of three. We investigate
the dust energy balance for IC4225 and NGC5166, two edge-on spiral galaxies
observed by the Herschel Space Observatory in the frame of the H-ATLAS survey.
We start from models which were constrained from optical data and extend them
to construct the entire spectral energy distribution of our galaxies. These
predicted values are subsequently compared to the observed far-infrared fluxes.
We find that including a young stellar population in the modelling is necessary
as it plays a non-negligible part in the heating of the dust grains. While the
modelling approach for both galaxies is nearly identical, we find two very
different results. As is often seen in other edge-on spiral galaxies, the
far-infrared emission of our radiative transfer model of IC4225 underestimates
the observed fluxes by a factor of about three. For NGC5166 on the other hand,
we find that both the predicted spectral energy distribution as well as the
simulated images match the observations particularly well. We explore possible
reasons for this difference and conclude that it is unlikely that one single
mechanism is the cause of the dust energy balance problem in spiral galaxies.
We discuss the different approaches that can be considered in order to get a
conclusive answer on the origin this discrepancy.

theory models have been proposed, which are variations of Unruh's sonic black
hole analogy. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to investigate
the dispersive field theory models. The preferred frame is the free-fall frame
of the black hole. The dispersion relation adopted agrees with the relativistic
one at low energy but is modified near the Planck mass $m_{p}$. The corrections
to the Hawking temperature are calculated for massive and charged particles to
$\mathcal{O}\left( m_{p}^{-2}\right) $ and neutral and massless particles with
$\lambda=0$ to all orders. The Hawking temperature of radiation agrees with the
standard one at the leading order. After the spectrum of radiation near the
horizon is obtained, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy
of a massless scalar field near the horizon of a 4D spherically symmetric black
hole and a 2D one. Finally, the luminosity of a Schwarzschild black hole is
calculated by using the geometric optics approximation.

the displacement of each individual particle is sub-diffusive. We analyse a
simple realization of this single file diffusion problem where one dimensional
Brownian point particles interact only by hard-core repulsion. We show that the
large deviation function which characterizes the displacement of a tracer at
large time can be computed via a mapping to a problem of non-interacting
Brownian particles. We confirm recently obtained results of the one time
distribution of the displacement and show how to extend them to the multi-time
correlations. The probability distribution of the tracer position depends on
whether we take annealed or quenched averages. In the quenched case we notice
an exact relation between the distribution of the tracer and the distribution
of the current. This relation is in fact much more general and would be valid
for arbitrary single file diffusion. It allows in particular to get the full
statistics of the tracer position for the symmetric simple exclusion process

the Sun is revisited with realistic 3D MHD simulations. As in other MHD
problems, dynamo action is found to be a sensitive function of the magnetic
Prandtl number ${\rm P_{\rm m} }=\nu/\eta$; it disappears below a critical
value ${\rm P_{\rm c}}$ which is a function of the numerical resolution. At a
grid spacing of 3.5 km, ${\rm P_{\rm c}}$ based on the hyperdiffusivities
implemented in the code (STAGGER) is $\approx 1$, increasing with increasing
grid spacing. As in other settings, it remains uncertain whether small scale
dynamo action is present in the astrophysical limit where ${\rm P_{\rm m} }<<1$
and magnetic Reynolds number ${\rm R_m}\gg 1$. The question is discussed in the
context of the strong effect that external stray fields are observed to have in
generating and maintaining dynamo action in other numerical and laboratory
systems, and in connection with the type-II hypertransient behavior of dynamo
action observed in the absence of such external fields.

discussed. We argue that the charges of ionized groups in proteins, and charges
of ions in conventional non-polarizable force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER,

neglect of electronic solvation energy, which typically amounts to about a half
of total solvation energy, in non-polarizable simulations with un-scaled
charges can produce a correct result; however, the correct solvation energy of
ions does not guarantee the correctness of ion-ion pair interactions in many
non-polarizable simulations. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged
moieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can
give rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional
non-polarizable force field simulations. The model also explains the striking
difference between the value of water dipole $\mu$~3D reported in recent ab
initio and experimental studies with the value $\mu_{eff}$~2.3D typically used
in the empirical potentials, such as TIP3P or SPC/E. It is shown that the
effective dipole of water can be understood as a scaled value
$\mu_{eff}=\mu/\sqrt{\epsilon_{el}}$, where $\epsilon_{el}$=1.78 is the
electronic (high-frequency) dielectric constant of water. This simple
theoretical framework provides important insights into the nature of the

infer the presence of patchy cloud cover. This paper proposes a mechanism for
producing inhomogeneous cloud coverage due to the depletion of cloud particles
through the Coulomb explosion of dust in atmospheric plasma regions. Charged
dust grains Coulomb-explode when the electrostatic stress of the grain exceeds
its mechanical tensile stress, which results in grains below a critical radius
$a<a^{\rm Coul}_{\rm crit}$ being broken up. This work outlines the criteria
required for the Coulomb explosion of dust clouds in substellar atmospheres,
the effect on the dust particle size distribution function, and the resulting
radiative properties of the atmospheric regions. Our results show that for an
atmospheric plasma region with an electron temperature of $T_{e}=10$~eV
($\approx10^{5}$~K), the critical grain radius varies from $10^{-7}$ to
$10^{-4}$~cm, depending on the grains' tensile strength. Higher critical radii
up to $10^{-3}$~cm are attainable for higher electron temperatures. We find
that the process produces a bimodal particle size distribution composed of
stable nanoscale seed particles and dust particles with $a\geq a^{\rm
Coul}_{\rm crit}$, with the intervening particle sizes defining a region devoid
of dust. As a result, the dust population is depleted, and the clouds become
optically thin in the wavelength range $0.1-10~\mu$m, with a characteristic
peak that shifts to higher wavelengths as more sub-micrometer particles are
destroyed. In an atmosphere populated with a distribution of plasma volumes,
this will yield regions of contrasting radiative properties, thereby giving a
source of inhomogeneous cloud coverage. The results presented here may also be
relevant for dust in supernova remnants and protoplanetary disks.

closed immersions, though the gluing construction still works for flat coherent
sheaves.
  We show that by further restricting this gluing construction to vector
bundles, we can construct pushouts along arbitrary morphisms (and more general
colimits) of certain algebraic stacks called Adams stacks. The proof of this
fact uses generalized Tannaka duality and a variant of Deligne's argument for
the existence of fiber functors which works in arbitrary characteristic.
  We use this version of Deligne's existence theorem for fiber functors as a
novel way of recognizing stacks which have atlases. It differs considerably
from Artin's algebraicity results and their generalizations: rather than
studying conditions on the functor of points which ensure the existence of an
atlas, our theorem identifies conditions on the category of quasi-coherent
sheaves of the stack which imply that an atlas exists.

frequent presence of extended, well-developed spiral arms far beyond the
optical radius. To understand the nature and the origin of such outer spiral
structure, we investigate the propagation in the outer gaseous disc of
large-scale spiral waves excited in the bright optical disc. Using
hydrodynamical simulations, we show that non-axisymmetric density waves,
penetrating in the gas through the outer Lindblad resonance, can exhibit
relatively regular spiral structures outside the bright optical stellar disc.
For low-amplitude structures, the results of numerical simulations match the
predictions of a simple WKB linear theory. The amplitude of spiral structure
increases rapidly with radius. Beyond $\approx 2$ optical radii, spirals become
nonlinear (the linear theory becomes quantitatively and qualitatively
inadequate) and unstable to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In numerical
simulations, in models for which gas is available very far out, spiral arms can
extend out to 25 disc scale-lengths. A comparison between the properties of the
models we have investigated and the observed properties of individual galaxies
may shed light into the problem of the amount and distribution of dark matter

  Synaptic Homeostasis",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In neural systems, synaptic plasticity is usually driven by spike trains. Due
to the inherent noises of neurons, synapses and networks, spike trains
typically exhibit externally uncontrollable variability such as spatial
heterogeneity and temporal stochasticity, resulting in variability of synapses,
which we call efficacy variability. Spike patterns with the same population
rate but inducing different efficacy variability may result in neuronal
networks with sharply different structures and functions. However, how the
variability of spike trains influences the efficacy variability remains
unclear. Here, we systematically study this influence when spike patterns
possess four aspects of statistical features, i.e. synchronous firing,
auto-temporal structure, heterogeneity of rates and heterogeneity of
cross-correlations, under spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) after
dynamically bounding the mean strength of plastic synapses into or out of a
neuron (synaptic homeostasis). We then show the functional importance of
efficacy variability on the encoding and maintenance of connection patterns and
on the early development of primary visual systems driven by retinal waves. We
anticipate our work brings a fresh perspective to the understanding of the
interaction between synaptic plasticity and dynamical spike patterns in
functional processes of neural systems.

interpenetrating icosahedra in CuZr metallic glass-forming liquids was
investigated via molecular dynamics simulations. Scaling analysis based on
percolation theory was employed, and it is found that the size distribution of
clusters formed by the central atoms of icosahedra at various temperatures
follows a very good scaling law with the cluster number density scaled by
$S^{-\tau}$ and the cluster size $S$ scaled by $|1-T_c/T|^{-1/\sigma}$,
respectively. Here $T_c$ is scaling crossover-temperature. $\tau$ and $\sigma$
are scaling exponents. The critical scaling behaviour suggests that there would
be a structural phase transition manifested by percolation of locally favoured
structures underlying the glass transition, if the liquid could be cooled
slowly enough but without crystallization intervening. Furthermore, it is
revealed that when icosahedral short-range order (ISRO) extends to medium-range
length scale by connection, the atomic configurations of ISROs will be
optimized from distorted ones towards more regular ones gradually, which
significantly lowers the energies of ISROs and introduces geometric frustration
simultaneously. Both factors make key impacts on the drastic dynamic slowdown
of supercooled liquids. Our findings provide direct structure-property

characterization for binary matroids and left a comment at end of the paper
that the problem of characterizing graphic matroids is the same as that of
characterizing matroids which correspond to matrices (mod 2) with exactly two
ones in each column. Later on Tutte obtained a characterization of graphic
matroids in terms of forbidden minors in 1959. It is clear that Whitney
indicated about incidence matrices of simple undirected graphs. Here we
introduce the concept of a segment binary matroid which corresponds to matrices
over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ which has the consecutive $1$'s property (i.e., $1$'s are
consecutive) for columns and obtained a characterization of graphic matroids in
terms of this. In fact, we introduce a new representation of simple undirected
graphs in terms of some vectors of finite dimensional vector spaces over
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ which satisfy consecutive $1$'s property. The set of such
vectors is called a coding sequence of a graph $G$. Among all such coding
sequences we identify the one which is unique for a class of isomorphic graphs.
We call it the code of the graph. We characterize several classes of graphs in
terms of coding sequences. It is shown that a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is a
tree if and only if any coding sequence of $G$ is a basis of the vector space
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{n-1}$ over $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Moreover considering coding sequences
as binary matroids, we obtain a characterization for simple graphic matroids
and found a necessary and sufficient condition for graph isomorphism in terms
of a special matroid isomorphism between their corresponding coding sequences.
For this, we introduce the concept of strong isomorphisms of segment binary
matroids and show that two simple (undirected) graphs are isomorphic if and
only if their canonical sequences are strongly isomorphic segment binary
matroids.

this classical picture and indicates that CaSO4*2H2O forms at room temperature
through multiple steps at different length and time-scales, these steps have so
far not been quantified. By using in situ and fast time-resolved small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS), we demonstrate that the nucleation and growth of
CaSO4*2H2O involves at the very initial stages the formation of well-defined,
primary species of < 3 nm in length (stage I). Stage II of the reaction is
characterized by the arrangement of these primary species into domains, while
in stage III these domains condense into larger aggregates. Based on volume
fractions and electron density considerations we propose that the fast forming
primary species from supersaturated aqueous CaSO4 solutions are composed of
anhydrous Ca-SO4-cores. The first three stages of nucleation and aggregation of
the primary species are followed by a final stage (stage IV), where the primary
species grow within the aggregates, and eventually transform into gypsum
(CaSO4*2H2O). This final stage was also confirmed through simultaneously
collected wide-angle scattering (diffraction, WAXS) data, which clearly show
the growth of gypsum during stage IV only. Our results demonstrate that CaSO4
formation is driven by the nucleation and aggregation of well-defined anhydrous
Ca-SO4-cores that transform through hydration into gypsum through a complex
nucleation and growth pathway.

successful in their own right but they have all been calibrated independently
using various observational data sets, stellar models, and merger trees. In
this paper we apply them without recalibration and this leads to a wide variety
of predictions for the stellar mass function, specific star formation rates,
stellar-to- halo mass ratios, and the abundance of orphan galaxies. The scatter
is much larger than seen in previous comparison studies primarily because the
codes have been used outside of their native environment within which they are
well tested and calibrated. The purpose of the `nIFTy comparison of galaxy

total field generated by these media at the points $z$. The second step is to
extract the values of the material coefficients from these internal values of
the total field. The main difficulty in using internal fields is the treatment
of their possible zeros.
  In this work, we propose to deform the medium using multiple (precisely
double) and close inclusions instead of only single ones. By doing so, we
derive from the asymptotic expansions of the farfields the internal values of
the Green function, in addition to the internal values of the total fields.
This is possible because of the deformation of the medium with multiple and
close inclusions which generates scattered fields due to the multiple
scattering between these inclusions. Then, the values of the index of
refraction can be extracted from the singularities of the Green function.
Hence, we overcome the difficulties arising from the zeros of the internal
fields.

$\partial^\beta_t$ is the Caputo fractional derivative while
$-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} $ is the generator of an isotropic stable process and
$I^{1-\beta}_t$ is the fractional integral operator. The forcing noise denoted
by $\stackrel{\cdot}{F}(t,x)$ is a Gaussian noise. And the multiplicative
non-linearity $\sigma$ is assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous.
  Under suitable conditions on the initial function, we study the asymptotic

particular, our results are significant extensions of existing results. Along
the way, we prove a number of interesting properties about the deterministic

The record time $t$ is a partial covering time when $v<n$ and a total covering
time when $v=n$. The probability distributions for the number of records $s$,
the record value $v$ and the record (covering) time $t$, involving $r$-Stirling
numbers, are obtained using generating function techniques. The mean values,
variances and skewnesses are deduced from the generating functions. In the
scaling limit the probability distributions for $s$ and $v$ lead to the same
Gaussian density. The fluctuations of the record time $t$ are also Gaussian at
partial covering, when $n-v={\mathrm O}(n)$. They are distributed according to
the type-I Gumbel extreme-value distribution at total covering, when $v=n$. A
discrete sequence of generalized Gumbel distributions, indexed by $n-v$, is
obtained at almost total covering, when $n-v={\mathrm O}(1)$. These generalized
Gumbel distributions are crossing over to the Gaussian distribution when $n-v$
increases.

applications such as face recognition, and implemented in two steps:
representation coding and classification. For a given set of testing images,
SRC codes every image over the base images as a sparse representation then
classifies it to the class with the least representation error. This scheme
utilizes an individual representation rather than the collective one to
classify such a set of images, doing so obviously ignores the correlation among
the given images. In this paper, a joint representation classification (JRC)
for collective face recognition is proposed. JRC takes the correlation of
multiple images as well as a single representation into account. Under the
assumption that the given face images are generally related to each other, JRC
codes all the testing images over the base images simultaneously to facilitate
recognition. To this end, the testing inputs are aligned into a matrix and the
joint representation coding is formulated to a generalized
$l_{2,q}-l_{2,p}$-minimization problem. To uniformly solve the induced
optimization problems for any $q\in[1,2]$ and $p\in (0,2]$, an iterative
quadratic method (IQM) is developed. IQM is proved to be a strict descent
algorithm with convergence to the optimal solution. Moreover, a more practical
IQM is proposed for large-scale case. Experimental results on three public
databases show that the JRC with practical IQM no only saves much computational
cost but also achieves better performance in collective face recognition than
the state-of-the-arts.

will suffer from many more runtime failures due to the decreasing trend in the

research is going on in the area of fault tolerance and fault mitigation.
Applications should survive a failure and/or be able to recover with minimal
cost. MPI is not yet very mature in handling failures, the User-Level Failure
Mitigation (ULFM) proposal being currently the most promising approach is still
in its prototype phase. In our work we use GASPI, which is a relatively new
communication library based on the PGAS model. It provides the missing features
to allow the design of fault-tolerant applications. Instead of introducing
algorithm-based fault tolerance in its true sense, we demonstrate how we can
build on (existing) clever checkpointing and extend applications to allow
integrate a low cost fault detection mechanism and, if necessary, recover the
application on the fly. The aspects of process management, the restoration of
groups and the recovery mechanism is presented in detail. We use a sparse
matrix vector multiplication based application to perform the analysis of the
overhead introduced by such modifications. Our fault detection mechanism causes
no overhead in failure-free cases, whereas in case of failure(s), the failure
detection and recovery cost is of reasonably acceptable order and shows good
scalability.

fraction of sub-stellar objects of $\sim$20%. The fraction of YSOs still
surrounded by disk/envelopes is very high ($\sim$85%) compared to other star
forming regions of similar age (1-2 Myr), but includes some uncertain
corrections for diskless YSOs. Yet, a possibly high disk fraction together with
the fact that 1/3 of the cloud mass has a gas surface density above the
threshold for star formation ($\sim$129 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), points towards a
still on-going star formation activity in L1630N. The star formation efficiency

variety in the technically most demanding case in which the relevant
Mordell-Weil group has strictly positive rank and the relevant field extension
is both non-abelian and of degree divisible by p. More generally, our approach
leads us to the formulation of certain precise families of conjectural p-adic
congruences between the values at s=1 of derivatives of the Hasse-Weil
L-functions associated to twists of A, normalised by a product of explicit
equivariant regulators and periods, and to explicit predictions concerning the
Galois structure of Tate-Shafarevich groups. In several interesting cases we
provide theoretical and numerical evidence in support of these more general
predictions.

cost-sensitive in nature, where the costs due to misclassification vary between

do not take these costs into account, and assume a constant cost of
misclassification errors. In previous works, some methods that take into
account the financial costs into the training of different algorithms have been
proposed, with the example-dependent cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm
being the one that gives the highest savings. In this paper we propose a new
framework of ensembles of example-dependent cost-sensitive decision-trees. The
framework consists in creating different example-dependent cost-sensitive
decision trees on random subsamples of the training set, and then combining
them using three different combination approaches. Moreover, we propose two new
cost-sensitive combination approaches; cost-sensitive weighted voting and
cost-sensitive stacking, the latter being based on the cost-sensitive logistic
regression method. Finally, using five different databases, from four
real-world applications: credit card fraud detection, churn modeling, credit
scoring and direct marketing, we evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art example-dependent cost-sensitive techniques, namely,
cost-proportionate sampling, Bayes minimum risk and cost-sensitive decision

from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Their orbits are expected to be circular
due to tidal interactions during the binary evolution, as observed in most of
the binary MSPs. There are some peculiar systems that do not fit this picture.
Three recent examples are PSRs J2234$+$06, J1946$+$3417 and J1950$+$2414, all
of which are MSPs in eccentric orbits but with mass functions compatible with
expected He white dwarf companions. It has been suggested these MSPs may have
formed from delayed accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs, or the
eccentricity may be induced by dynamical interaction between the binary and a
circumbinary disk. Assuming that the core density of accreting neutron stars in
LMXBs may reach the density of quark deconfinement, which can lead to phase
transition from neutron stars to strange quark stars, we show that the
resultant MSPs are likely to have an eccentric orbit, due to the sudden loss of
the gravitational mass of the neutron star during the transition. The
eccentricities can be reproduced with a reasonable estimate of the mass loss.
This scenario might also account for the formation of the youngest known X-ray
binary Cir X$-$1, which also possesses a low-field compact star in an eccentric
orbit.

increase of conformer fineness, and tested the hypothesis in lipid molecule
palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC). Furthermore, when explicit
conformers with ISWD were utilized as basic states to define conformational
entropy, change of which between two given macrostates was found to be
equivalent to change of free energy except a mere difference of a negative
temperature factor, and change of enthalpy essentially cancels corresponding
change of average intra-conformer entropy. These findings suggest that entropy
enthalpy compensation is inherently a local phenomenon in configurational
space. By implicitly taking advantage of entropy enthalpy compensation and
forgoing all dynamical information, constructing explicit conformers with ISWD

Trucco \cite{Trucco} to interpret as the structural information content of the
graph and serve as a complexity measure. In this paper, we first state a number
of definitions of graph entropy measures and generalized graph entropies. Then
we survey the known results about them from the following three respects:
inequalities and extremal properties on graph entropies, relationships between
graph structures, graph energies, topological indices and generalized graph
entropies, complexity for calculation of graph entropies. Various applications
of graph entropies together with some open problems and conjectures are also
presented for further research.

in the population of certain effector T-cell repertoire become suppressed.
Motivated by such observations and in an attempt to quantify adaptive human
response to pathogens, we define an immune response function (IMRF) in terms of
mean square fluctuations of T-cell concentrations. We employ a recently
developed kinetic model of T-cell regulation that contains the essential
immunosuppressive effects of vitamin-D. We employ Gillespie algorithm to make
the first study of fluctuations along the stochastic trajectories. This
fluctuation-based IMRF can differentiate responses of different individuals
after pathogenic incursion both under healthy and disease conditions. We find
that relative fluctuations in T-cells (and hence IMRF) are different in
strongly regulated (malignant prone) and weakly regulated (autoimmune prone)
regions. The cross-over from one steady state (weakly regulated) to the other
(strongly regulated) is accompanied by a divergence-like growth in the
fluctuation of both the effector and regulatory T-cell concentration over a
wide range of pathogenic stimulation, displaying a dynamical phase transition
like behavior. The growth in fluctuation in this desired immune response regime
is found to arise from an intermittent fluctuation between regulatory and
effector T-cells that results in a bimodal distribution of population of each,
indicating bistability. The signature of intermittent behavior is further
confirmed by calculating the power spectrum of the corresponding fluctuation of
time correlation function. The calculated time correlation functions of
fluctuations show that the slow fluctuation causes the bistabilty in healthy
state. Thus, in diseases diagnosis process, such steady state response
parameters can provide immense information which might become helpful to define
an immune status.

quantum physical evolutions lies at the core of many optimality theorems in
quantum information theory and has applications in other areas of physics. In
this work, we establish improvements of this entropy inequality in the form of
physically meaningful remainder terms. One of the main results can be
summarized informally as follows: if the decrease in quantum relative entropy
between two quantum states after a quantum physical evolution is relatively
small, then it is possible to perform a recovery operation, such that one can
perfectly recover one state while approximately recovering the other. This can
be interpreted as quantifying how well one can reverse a quantum physical
evolution. Our proof method is elementary, relying on the method of complex
interpolation, basic linear algebra, and the recently introduced Renyi
generalization of a relative entropy difference. The theorem has a number of
applications in quantum information theory, which have to do with providing
physically meaningful improvements to many known entropy inequalities.

bursty user traffic, where intermittent data traffic restricts the users to
bursty transmissions. To this end, we study a two-user bursty MIMO Gaussian
interference channel with a relay, where two Bernoulli random states govern the
bursty user traffic. We show that an in-band relay can provide a degrees of
freedom (DoF) gain in this bursty channel. This beneficial role of in-band
relays in the bursty channel is in direct contrast to their role in the
non-bursty channel which is not as significant to provide a DoF gain. More
importantly, we demonstrate that for certain antenna configurations, an in-band
relay can help achieve interference-free performances with increased DoF. We
find the benefits particularly substantial with low data traffic, as the DoF
gain can grow linearly with the number of antennas at the relay. In this work,
we first derive an outer bound from which we obtain a necessary condition for
interference-free DoF performances. Then, we develop a novel scheme that
exploits information of the bursty traffic states to achieve them.

significant role in the beam dynamics. The resulting reduction in relative
energy spread (beam cooling) at the expense of mean beam energy predicted by
classical theories of radiation reaction depends only on the energy of the
laser pulse. Quantum effects suppress this cooling, with the dynamics
additionally sensitive to the distribution of energy within the pulse. Since
chirps occur in both the production of high-intensity pulses (CPA) and the
propagation of pulses in media, the effect of using chirps to modify the pulse

surfactant efficiency for a 5000 g/mol PG with 5.6% of the available hydroxyl
end-groups replaced by trityl functions, as shown by UV-vis measurements.
Semiempirical model calculations suggest an even higher efficiency for PG5000
with 2.5% functionalization and maximal molecule specific efficiency in general
at low degrees of functionalization. Addition of trityl groups increases the
surfactant-nanotube interactions in comparison to unfunctionalized PG because
of pi-pi stacking interactions. However, at higher functionalization degrees
mutual interactions between trityl groups come into play, decreasing the
surfactant efficiency, while lack of water solubility becomes an issue at very
high functionalization degrees. Low molar mass surfactants are less efficient
compared to higher molar mass species most likely because the higher bulkiness
of the latter allows for a better CNT separation and stabilization. The most
efficient surfactant studied allowed dispersing 2.85 mg of CNT in 20 mL with as
little as 1 mg of surfactant. These dispersions, remaining stable for at least
2 months, were mainly composed of individual CNTs as revealed by electron
microscopy.

  workplaces: benefit for the city air quality","11 pages, 5 figures, conference paper",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Industrial activities carried out in confined spaces are characterized by a
very specific type of air pollution. The extended exposure to this kind of
pollution is often highly harmful, resulting in dramatic effects both on health
and safety aspects. The indoor industrial abatement systems, adopted to purify
the air, are typically applied to the emission points. The processed air is
subsequently emitted outside. In this study we present the experimental results
of three-stage wet scrubber systems installed in the industrial workplace of a
(i) fiberglass processing plant, where the highest exposure levels to volatile
compounds are nowadays today monitored,and of a (ii) waste-to-energy plant,
characterized by a very high particulate matter level. The adopted technology,
to be used as complementing strategy,does not require special disposal
procedures and the processed air is re-emitted in the same work environment for
the benefit of the work operators. The operation of the scrubbers network
during the working activities, in both the examined environments, has a)
reduced the level of volatile compounds by about 40% and b) maintained the
particulate matter concentration PM > 1 to a very low level. Industrial plants
are disseminated in mega-cities and represent dangerous diffuse pollution
emission sources. Remediation of highly polluted industrial plants inside our
towns, especially for the conventionally untreated emissions, is of extreme
benefit for the cities air quality.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1502.05493",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this research, we propose a new model that allows to unify inflation,
deceleration and acceleration phases of expansion history in BIonic system. In
this model, in the beginning, there have been $k$ black fundamental strings
that transited to the BIon configuration at a corresponding point. At this
point, two universe brane and universe antibrane have been created, interacted
with each other via one wormhole and inflated. With decreasing temperature, the
energy of this wormhole flowed into universe branes and lead to inflation.
After a short time, wormhole died, inflation ended and deceleration epoch
started. With approaching two universe brane and antibrane together, tachyon
was born, grew and caused creation of one new wormhole. At this time, two
universe brane and antibrane connected again and late-time acceleration era of
the universe began. We compare our model with previous unified phantom model
and observational data and obtain some cosmological parameters like temperature
in terms of time. We also find that deceleration parameter is negative during
inflation and late-time acceleration epochs and positive during deceleration
era. This means that our model is consistent with previous prediction and
cosmological experiments.

idea of Freeman Dyson considering pulsars instead of stars. It is shown that
instead of a spherical shell the supercivilization must use ring-like
constructions. We have found that a size of the ""ring"" should be of the order
of $(10^{-4}-10^{-1})$AU with temperature interval $(300-600)$K for relatively
slowly rotating pulsars and $(10-350)$AU with temperature interval $(300-700)$K
for rapidly spinning neutron stars, respectively. Although for the latter the
Dyson construction is unrealistically massive and cannot be considered
seriously. Analyzing the stresses in terms of the radiation and wind flows it
has been argued that they cannot significantly affect the ring construction. On
the other hand, the ring in-plane unstable equilibrium can be restored by the
energy which is small compared to the energy extracted from the star. This
indicates that the search for infrared ring-like sources close to slowly
rotating pulsars seems to be quite promising.

electromagnetic interaction of leptons and quarks is expressed as
${^t\psi}{\mathcal C}x_i\psi$. In the case of coupling of leptons and quarks
with $W$, we extend the coupling ${^t\phi}{\mathcal C}X\psi$ to
${^t\phi}{\mathcal C}X(1-\gamma_5)\psi$, where $X=x_i$ or ${x_i}'$, and unify
the interactions in the form $ {^t\phi}{\mathcal

$\bar{x_i}$ implies appropriate $x_i$ or $(-\gamma_5 x_i)$ is chosen. The
$\gamma_5$ term induces in time component of $B^0\to K^0\, J/\Psi$, $K^0$ with
the $\bar s$ quark dominated by the small component, while in space components
of $\bar B^0\to \bar K^0\, J/\Psi$, $\bar K^0$ with the $s$ quark dominated by
the small component. This asymmetry could be the origin of the $CP$ asymmetry
in the $B^0\to K^0\, J/\Psi$.
  We apply the model to $B_{s(d)}^0\to D_{s(d)}^- D_{s(d)}^+$ decays and study
violation of $CP$ symmetry via interference of tree and penguin contributions,
and observe that the asymmetry is weak consistent to the experiment.
