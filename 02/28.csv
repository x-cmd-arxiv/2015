modified acceleration that can fit an anomalous acceleration experienced by the
Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. The future positions of those spacecrafts are
predicted using distorted hyperbolic orbit. A connection between an anomalous
acceleration and a Hubble constant is solved in the theory together with a
relation to a cosmological constant using a paradigm of modern cosmology. . In
the paper we consider an exact solution of a point mass motion in the Solar
System under an influence of an anomalous acceleration. We find two types of
orbits: periodic and chaotic. Both orbits are bounded. This means there is no
possibility to escape from the Solar System. Some possibilities to avoid this
conclusion are considered. Relativistic effects and a cosmological drifting of
a gravitational constant are considered.The model of an anomalous acceleration
does not cause any contradiction with Solar System observations. We give a full
statistical analysis of the model.

in two-leg ladders, characterized by a density-driven Meissner- to

imbalance between the legs. Density-dependent fields also lead to intriguing
physics in square lattices. In particular, it leads to a density-driven
transition between a non-chiral and a chiral superfluid, both characterized by
non-trivial charge density-wave amplitude. We finally show how the physics due
to the density-dependent fields may be easily probed in experiments by
monitoring the expansion of doublons and holes in a Mott insulator, which
presents a remarkable dependence on quantum fluctuations.

Comptonization. All three interpretations describe the 0.5-10.0 keV spectra
well. Extrapolating the models to 100 keV results in poorer fits for the the

describe all the observations in the most self-consistent manner. If adopted,
the blurred reflection model requires a very low iron abundance in HE

subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative entropy

random forest. Furthermore, we were able to identify in the analysis of mass

infer underlying atomic-scale structure from decoherence traces in all but the

striking, but overlooked, coherence decay features in terms of the form of the
avoided crossings of the underlying quasienergy eigenspectrum. This is
exemplified by a set of ""diamond"" shaped features arising for transverse-field

failures due to the characteristics of the system itself. The tremendous cost
of systemic risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the
efficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current
paper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk.
  Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures
from the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial
regulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms
of capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two
ingredients: a cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations
of the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome; and an
acceptability criterion, i.e. a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a
regulatory authority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of
additional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual
framework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm
for their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case
studies.
  Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal
amount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after
aggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail-out. In
contrast, our approach emphasizes operational systemic risk measures that
include both ex post bailout costs as well as ex ante capital requirements and
may be used to prevent systemic crises.

reveal essential aspects of phase transitions in complex systems. An efficient
way to estimate the microcanonical inverse temperature $\beta(E)$ and the
microcanonical entropy $S(E)$ is achieved with the statistical temperature
weighted histogram analysis method (ST-WHAM). The strength of this method lies
on its flexibility, as it can be used to analyse data produced by algorithms
with generalised sampling weights. However, for any sampling weight, ST-WHAM
requires the calculation of derivatives of energy histograms $H(E)$, which
leads to non-trivial and tedious binning tasks for models with continuous
energy spectrum such as those for biomolecular and colloidal systems. Here, we
discuss two alternative methods that avoid the need for such energy binning to
obtain continuous estimates for $H(E)$ in order to evaluate $\beta(E)$ by using
ST-WHAM: (i) a series expansion to estimate probability densities from the
empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF), and (ii) a Bayesian approach
to model this CDF. Comparison with a simple linear regression method is also
carried out. The performance of these approaches is evaluated considering
coarse-grained protein models for folding and peptide aggregation.

the SED fits we derive the star-formation histories (SFH) of these galaxies.
For nearly half of them the star-formation rate appears to be approximately
constant during the last few Gyrs. In the other half, the current
star-formation rate seems to be enhanced by a factor of 3-20 with respect to

starbursts and they are compatible with the expected properties of a

The relative size of the off-shell contributions is strongly dependent on the
centre-of-mass energy. These contributions can have an important impact on the
determination of cross sections and branching ratios. However, the combination
of on- and off-shell contributions can also be utilised to lift degeneracies
allowing to test higher-dimensional operators, unitarity and light and heavy
Higgs interferences in extended Higgs sectors. The latter is demonstrated in
the context of a 2-Higgs-Doublet model. We also discuss the impact of these
aspects for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) where they are relevant. The
importance of a precise measurement of the Higgs mass for on-shell
contributions in $H\to VV^{(*)}$ is emphasized. A particular focus is put on
methods for extracting the Higgs width at a LC. Off-shell contributions are
shown to have a negligible impact on the width determination at low $\sqrt{s}$
when applying the $Z$ recoil method to extract branching ratios in combination
with an appropriate determination of a partial width. On the other hand,
off-shell contributions can be exploited to constrain the Higgs width in a
similar fashion as in recent analyses at the LHC. It is demonstrated that this
approach, besides relying heavily on theoretical assumptions, is affected by
the negative interference of Higgs and background contributions that may limit
the sensitivity that is achievable with the highest foreseeable statistics at
the LHC and a LC.

rays interact with photons of the extragalactic background light to produce
electron-positron pairs, which lose their kinetic energy to the surrounding
medium through plasma instabilities. This results in a heating mechanism that
is only weakly sensitive to the local density, and therefore approximately
spatially uniform, naturally producing an inverted temperature-density relation
in underdense regions. In this paper we go beyond the approximation of uniform
heating and quantify the heating rate fluctuations due to the clustered
distribution of blazars and how this impacts on the thermal history of the IGM.
We analytically compute a filtering function that relates the heating rate
fluctuations to the underlying dark matter density field. We implement it in
the cosmological code GADGET-3 and perform large scale simulations to determine
the impact of inhomogeneous heating. We show that, because of blazar
clustering, blazar heating is inhomogeneous for z>= 2. At high redshift, the
temperature-density relation shows an important scatter and presents a low
temperature envelope of unheated regions, in particular at low densities and
within voids. However, the median temperature of the IGM is close to that in
the uniform case, albeit slightly lower at low redshift. We find that blazar
heating is more complex than initially assumed and that the temperature-density
relation is not unique. Our analytic model for the heating rate fluctuations
couples well with large scale simulations and provides a cost-effective
alternative to subgrid models.

Sr2IrO4, we apply a variable external electric field up to a few MV/m and
demonstrate a continuous reduction in the band gap of Sr2IrO4 by as much as
16%. We further demonstrate the feasibility of reversible resistive switching
and electrically tunable anisotropic magnetoresistance,which provide evidence
of correlations between electronic transport, magnetic order, and orbital
states in this 5d oxide. Our findings suggest a promising path towards band gap
engineering in 5d transition-metal oxides that could potentially lead to
appealing technical solutions for next-generation electronic devices.

often needed both in thermal field theory and at zero temperature. For
instance, the behaviour of the Standard Model (SM) effective potential
extrapolated to very high energies is known to be extremely sensitive to
higher-order effects. The 2PI effective action provides a systematic approach
to consistently perform such resummations. However, one of its major
limitations was that its loopwise expansion introduces residual violations of
possible global symmetries, thus giving rise to massive Goldstone bosons in the
spontaneously broken phase of the theory. We review the recently developed
symmetry-improved 2PI formalism for consistently encoding global symmetries in
the 2PI approach, and discuss its satisfactory field-theoretical properties. We
then apply the formalism to study the infrared divergences of the SM effective
potential due to Goldstone bosons, which may affect the stability analyses of
the SM. We present quantitative comparisons, for the scalar sector of the SM,
with the approximate partial resummation procedure recently developed to
address this problem, and show the quantitative discrepancy of the latter with
the more complete 2PI approach, thus motivating further studies in this

requires one to consider generically off-diagonal number densities, rank-4 rate
tensors in flavour space, and non-trivial generalization of the discrete
symmetries C, P and T. The flavour-covariant transport equations, obtained in
our semi-classical framework, describe the effects of three relevant physical
phenomena: coherent heavy-neutrino oscillations, quantum decoherence in the
charged-lepton sector, and resonant CP violation due to heavy-neutrino mixing.
We show quantitatively that the final asymmetry is enhanced by up to an order
of magnitude, for electroweak-scale heavy neutrinos, as compared to that
obtained from flavour-diagonal or partially flavour off-diagonal equations. A
full field-theoretic treatment in the weakly-resonant regime, based on the
Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations, confirms that heavy-neutrino oscillations and
mixing are two distinct phenomena, and reproduces the results obtained in our
semi-classical framework. Finally, we show that the quasi-particle ansaetze,
often employed in KB approaches to RL, discard the phenomenon of mixing,
capturing only oscillations and leading to an underestimate of the final

representation in a large number of signal processing applications. However,
high resolution and accurate instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation usually
depend on the employed distribution and complexity of signal phase function. To
ensure an efficient IF tracking for various types of signals, the class of
complex time distributions has been developed. These distributions facilitate
analysis in the cases when standard distributions cannot provide satisfactory
results (e.g., for highly nonstationary signal phase). In that sense, an
ambiguity based form of the forth order complex-time distribution is
considered, in a new compressive sensing (CS) context. CS is an intensively
growing approach in signal processing that allows efficient analysis and
reconstruction of randomly undersampled signals. In this paper, the randomly
chosen ambiguity domain coefficients serve as CS measurements. By exploiting
sparsity in the time-frequency plane, it is possible to obtain highly
concentrated IF using just small number of random coefficients from ambiguity
domain. Moreover, in noisy signal case, this CS approach can be efficiently
combined with the L-statistics producing robust time-frequency representations.
Noisy coefficients are firstly removed using the L-statistics and then
reconstructed by using CS algorithm. The theoretical considerations are
illustrated using experimental results.

toward this goal. First, we made participants select artificial skin samples
according to their preferred warmth and softness characteristics. At room

surface of a soft silicone rubber material that has a Shore durometer value of
30 at the OO scale. Second, we developed a process to create a rubber hand
replica of a human hand. To compare the skin softness of a human hand and
artificial hands, a robotic indenter was employed to produce a softness map by
recording the displacement data when constant indentation force of 1 N was
applied to 780 data points on the palmar side of the hand. Results showed that
an artificial hand with skeletal structure is as soft as a human hand. Lastly,
the participants arms were touched with human and artificial hands, but they
were prevented to see the hand that touched them. Receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis suggests that a warm and soft artificial hand can
create an illusion that the touch is from a human hand. These findings open the
possibilities for prosthetic and robotic hands that are lifelike and are more

{\it a priori} space-time interpretation or a pre-assumption of locality. This

theory on a flat background and develop a variety of technical and
interpretational ideas. These include a formulation of the moduli space of
Lorentzian worldsheets, a careful study of the symplectic structure and
consequently consistent closed and open boundary conditions, and the string
spectrum and operator algebra. What emerges from these studies is a new quantum
notion of space-time that we refer to as a quantum Lagrangian or equivalently a
\hlt{modular space-time}. This concept embodies the standard tenets of quantum
theory and implements in a precise way a notion of {relative locality}. The
usual string backgrounds (non-compact space-time along with some toroidally
compactified spatial directions) are obtained from modular space-time by a
limiting procedure that can be thought of as a correspondence limit.

compare the results of the variational approximation with numerical simulations
of the NLD equation, and find a good agreement, if we take into account a
certain linear excitation with specific wavenumber that is excited together

theories in predicate logic. A 2-category of `regular fibrations' is
constructed, as well as a 2-category of `regular proarrow equipments', and it
is shown that the two are equivalent. A regular equipment is a `cartesian
equipment' satisfying certain axioms, and a cartesian equipment is a slight
generalization of a cartesian bicategory.
  This is done by defining a tricategory Biprof whose objects are bicategories
and whose morphisms are category-valued profunctors, and then defining an
equipment to be a pseudo-monad in this tricategory. The resulting notion of
equipment is compared to several existing ones. Most importantly, this involves
showing that every pseudo-monad in Biprof has a Kleisli object. A strict
2-category of equipments, over locally discrete base bicategories, is
identified, and cartesian equipments are defined to be the cartesian objects in
this 2-category. Thus cartesian equipments themselves form a 2-category, and
this is shown to admit a 2-fully-faithful functor from the 2-category of
regular fibrations. The cartesian equipments in the image of this functor are
characterized as those satisfying certain axioms, and hence a 2-category of
`regular equipments' is identified that is equivalent to that of regular
fibrations.
  It is then shown that a regular fibration admits comprehension for predicates
if and only if its corresponding regular equipment admits tabulation for
morphisms, and further that the presence of tabulations for morphisms is
equivalent to the existence of Eilenberg--Moore objects for co-monads. We
conclude with a brief examination of the two different constructions of the
effective topos, via triposes and via assemblies, in the light of the
foregoing.

of soap bubbles from thin films is accompanied by topological transitions, and
thus the natural question arises whether this concept is applicable to the
generation of other topological states. Here we show how a magnetic topological
structure, namely a skyrmion bubble, can be generated in a solid state system
in a similar manner. Beyond enabling the investigation of complex
surface-tension driven dynamics in a novel physical system, this observation
has also practical implications, since the topological charge of magnetic

manipulation of individual mobile skyrmions at room temperature. By utilizing
an inhomogeneous in-plane current in a system with broken inversion asymmetry,
we experimentally blow magnetic skyrmion bubbles through a geometrical
constriction. The presence of a spatially divergent spin-orbit torque gives
rise to instabilities of the magnetic domain structures that are reminiscent of
Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities in fluid flows. Experimentally we can determine
the electric current versus magnetic field phase diagram for skyrmion formation
and we reveal the efficient manipulation of these dynamically created

nuclei is needed for precision era neutrino long baseline experiments (MINOS,
NOvA, DUNE) which all use nuclear targets. Pion production is the dominant
reaction channel at the energies of these experiments. [Purpose] Investigate
the influence of nuclear effects on neutrino-induced pion production cross
sections and compare predictions for pion-production with available data.
[Method] The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model is used for
the description of all incohrent channels in neutrino-nucleus reactions.
[Results] Differential cross sections for charged and neutral pion production
for the MINER$\nu$A neutrino and antineutrino flux are calculated. An estimate
for the coherent cross section is obtained from a comparison of data with
theoretical results. The invariant mass ($W$) distribution of the $\Delta$
resonances produced is analyzed. [Conclusions] Final state interactions affect
the pion kinetic energy spectra significantly. The data for charged pion
production at MINER$\nu$A are compatible with the results of calculations using
elementary data taken from an old Argonne National Laboratory experiment.
Remaining differences can be attributed to coherent production; the data for
antineutrino induced neutral pion production, where no coherent contribution is
present, are reproduced quite well. In contrast, the MiniBooNE data, taken at a
lower energy, are consistently higher than the theoretical description. The
analysis of $W$-distributions shows that experimental cuts on this quantity
lead to shape distortions for nuclear targets.

using contact probes. But, non-contact methods for measuring vital signs are
desirable both in hospital settings (e.g. in NICU) and for ubiquitous in-situ
health tracking (e.g. on mobile phone and computers with webcams). Recently,
camera-based non-contact vital sign monitoring have been shown to be feasible.
However, camera-based vital sign monitoring is challenging for people with
darker skin tone, under low lighting conditions, and/or during movement of an
individual in front of the camera. In this paper, we propose distancePPG, a new
camera-based vital sign estimation algorithm which addresses these challenges.
DistancePPG proposes a new method of combining skin-color change signals from
different tracked regions of the face using a weighted average, where the
weights depend on the blood perfusion and incident light intensity in the
region, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of camera-based estimate.
One of our key contributions is a new automatic method for determining the
weights based only on the video recording of the subject. The gains in SNR of
camera-based PPG estimated using distancePPG translate into reduction of the
error in vital sign estimation, and thus expand the scope of camera-based vital
sign monitoring to potentially challenging scenarios. Further, a dataset will
be released, comprising of synchronized video recordings of face and pulse
oximeter based ground truth recordings from the earlobe for people with

Here, we focus on the study of normal state electronic properties, in

states, $A(\omega)$, and of $A(\vec{k},\omega)$ in different Brillouin zone
regions, and compare them to the existing angle resolved photoemission

obtain an asymmetric effect of electron and hole doping, quantitative agreement
with the experimental chemical potential shifts as a function of doping, as
well as spectral weight redistributions near the Fermi level as a function of
temperature consistent with the available experimental data. In addition, we
predict a non-trivial dependence of the total density of states with the
temperature, exhibiting clear renormalization effects by correlations.
Interestingly, investigating the origin of this predicted behaviour by
analyzing the evolution with temperature of the k-dependent self-energy
obtained in our approach, we could identify a number of specific Brillouin zone

non-trivial effects of temperature on the renormalization are present.

electrons of the noble gas atoms Ar, Kr and Xe is calculated within the
framework of diagrammatic many-body theory. The effect of positron-atom and
short-range positron-electron correlations on the annihilation process is
examined in detail. Short-range correlations, which are described through
non-local corrections to the vertex of the annihilation amplitude, are found to
significantly enhance the spectra for annihilation on the core orbitals. For
Ar, Kr and Xe, the core contributions to the annihilation rate are found to be
0.55\%, 1.5\% and 2.2\% respectively, their small values reflecting the
difficulty for the positron to probe distances close to the nucleus.
Importantly however, the core subshells have a broad momentum distribution and
markedly contribute to the annihilation spectra at Doppler energy shifts
$\gtrsim3$\,keV, and even dominate the spectra of Kr and Xe at shifts
$\gtrsim5$\,keV. Their inclusion brings the theoretical spectra into excellent
agreement with the experimental $\gamma$-spectra across the full range of
Doppler energy shifts. Additionally, the theory enables the calculation of the
`exact' vertex enhancement factors $\bar{\gamma}_{n\ell}$ for individual core
and valence subshells $n\ell$. They are found to follow a simple and physically
motivated scaling with the subshell ionization energy $I_{n\ell}$:
$\bar{\gamma}_{n\ell}=1+\sqrt{A/I_{n\ell}}+(B/I_{n\ell})^{\beta}$, where $A$,
$B$ and $\beta$ are positive constants. It is demonstrated that these factors
can be incorporated in simple independent-particle-model calculations to
successfully reconstruct the true many-body annihilation $\gamma$-spectra. This

the formalism is fully independent and it has a much wider range of

are not well understood despite the long history of observations. Recently,
Dexter & Agol presented a model of quasar UV-optical variability, which assumes
large local temperature fluctuations in the quasar accretion discs. This
inhomogeneous accretion disc model is claimed to describe not only the
single-band variability amplitude, but also microlensing size constraints and
the quasar composite spectral shape. In this work, we examine the validity of
the inhomogeneous accretion disc model in the light of quasar UV-optical
spectral variability by using five-band multi-epoch light curves for nearly 9
000 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 region. By
comparing the values of the intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\text{int}}$ of the
two-band magnitude-magnitude plots for the SDSS quasar light curves and for the
simulated light curves, we show that Dexter & Agol's inhomogeneous accretion
disc model cannot explain the tight inter-band correlation often observed in
the SDSS quasar light curves. This result leads us to conclude that the local
temperature fluctuations in the accretion discs are not the main driver of the
several years' UV-optical variability of quasars, and consequently, that the
assumption that the quasar accretion discs have large localized temperature
fluctuations is not preferred from the viewpoint of the UV-optical spectral
variability.

spectrographs to characterise them in the UV. The detailed properties of these
galaxies could be measured from dust and cool gas emission at far-infrared
wavelengths if the galaxies have become sufficiently enriched in dust and
metals. So far, however, the most distant UV-selected galaxy detected in dust
emission is only at $z = 3.25$, and recent results have cast doubt on whether
dust and molecules can be found in typical galaxies at this early epoch. Here
we report thermal dust emission from an archetypal early universe star-forming
galaxy, A1689-zD1. We detect its stellar continuum in spectroscopy and
determine its redshift to be $z = 7.5\pm0.2$ from a spectroscopic detection of
the Ly{\alpha} break. A1689-zD1 is representative of the star-forming
population during reionisation, with a total star-formation rate of about
12M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The galaxy is highly evolved: it has a large stellar
mass, and is heavily enriched in dust, with a dust-to-gas ratio close to that
of the Milky Way. Dusty, evolved galaxies are thus present among the fainter

whether they can be sharply covariant in the sense that the generating groups

MUB in dimension $d$. Sharply covariant MUB, if they exist, would be most
appealing from both theoretical and practical point of view. Since stabilizer
MUB subsume almost all MUB that have ever been constructed, it is of
fundamental interest to single out those candidates that are sharply covariant.
We show that, quite surprisingly, only two stabilizer MUB are sharply
covariant, and the conclusion still holds even if antiunitary transformations
are taken into account. Our study provides valuable insight on the symmetry of
stabilizer MUB, which may have implications for a number of research topics in

clouds. Objects in evolved stages of massive star formation such as protostars,
hot molecular cores, and ultracompact HII regions have been studied in more
detail than earlier, colder objects. With this in mind, the APEX Telescope
Large Area Survey of the whole inner Galactic plane at 870 micron (ATLASGAL)
has been carried out to provide a global view of cold dust and star formation
at submillimetre wavelengths. To derive kinematic distances to a large sample
of ATLASGAL clumps we divided them into groups of sources, which are located
close together, mostly within a radius of 2 pc, and have velocities in a
similar range with a median velocity dispersion of ~ 1 km/s. Using NH3, N2H+
and CS velocities we calculate near and far kinematic distances to 296 groups
of ATLASGAL sources in the first quadrant and 393 groups in the fourth
quadrant. We analyse HI self-absorption and HI absorption to resolve the
kinematic distance ambiguity. We obtain a scale height of ~ 28+/-2 pc and
displacement below the Galactic midplane of ~ -7+/-1 pc. Within distances from
2 to 18 kpc ATLASGAL clumps have a broad range of gas masses with a median of
1050 solar masses and a wide distribution of radii with a median of 0.4 pc.
Their distribution in galactocentric radii is correlated with spiral arms.
Using a statistically significant ATLASGAL sample we derive a power-law
exponent of -2.2+/-0.1 of the clump mass function. This is consistent with the
slope derived for clusters and with that of the stellar initial mass function.
Examining the power-law index for different galactocentric distances and
various source samples shows that it is independent of environment and
evolutionary phase. Fitting the mass-size relationship by a power law gives a
slope of 1.76+/-0.01 for cold sources such as IRDCs and warm clumps associated
with HII regions.

particular, in the supersonic regime, the phonons emitted by the relaxing qubit
is concentrated along certain directions, similar to the shock waves produced
in classical Cherenkov effect. As the speed of the moving qubit increases from
the subsonic regime to the supersonic regime, the qubit experiences a peak in
the spin relaxation rate near the speed of sound, which we term a spin
relaxation boom in analogy to the classical sonic boom. We also find that the
moving spin qubit may have a lower relaxation rate than a static qubit, which
hints at the possibility of coherence-preserving transportation for a spin
qubit. While the physics we have studied here has strong classical analogies,
we do find that quantum confinement for the spin qubit plays an important role

in a (3+1)-dimensional spacetime is used to study the thermodynamic and
entropic properties of the corresponding spacetime. Inside the shell, the
spacetime is flat, outside it is Reissner-Nordstr\""om, and this establishes the
energy density, the pressure, and the electric charge in the shell. Imposing
that the shell is at a given local temperature and that the first law of
thermodynamics holds on the shell one can find the integrability conditions for
the temperature and for the thermodynamic electric potential, the thermodynamic
equilibrium states, and the thermodynamic stability conditions. Through the
integrability conditions and the first law of thermodynamics an expression for
the shell's entropy can be calculated. It is found that the shell's entropy is
a function of the shell's gravitational and Cauchy radii alone. A plethora of
sets of temperature and electric potential equations of state can be given. One
set of equations of state is related to the Hawking temperature and a precisely
given electric potential. Then, as one pushes the shell to its own
gravitational radius and the temperature is set precisely equal to the Hawking
temperature, so that there is a finite quantum backreaction, one finds that the
entropy of the shell equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a black hole.
Other set of equations of state are given and the thermodynamic properties
analyzed. Whatever the initial equation of state for the temperature, as the
shell radius approaches its own gravitational radius, the quantum backreaction
imposes the Hawking temperature for the shell in this limit. Thus, when the
shell's radius is sent to the shell's own gravitational radius the formalism
developed allows to find the precise form of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of
the correlated black hole.

of computational models, exploring the interplay between experimental designs
and approximation algorithms. We focus on two widely used approximation
approaches, Gaussian process (GP) regression and non-intrusive polynomial
approximation. First, we introduce algorithms for minimizing a posterior
integrated variance (IVAR) design criterion for GP regression. Our formulation
treats design as a continuous optimization problem that can be solved with
gradient-based methods on complex input domains, without resorting to greedy
approximations. We show that minimizing IVAR in this way yields point sets with
good interpolation properties, and that it enables more accurate GP regression
than designs based on entropy minimization or mutual information maximization.
Second, using a Mercer kernel/eigenfunction perspective on GP regression, we
identify conditions under which GP regression coincides with pseudospectral
polynomial approximation. Departures from these conditions can be understood as
changes either to the kernel or to the experimental design itself. We then show
how IVAR-optimal designs, while sacrificing discrete orthogonality of the
kernel eigenfunctions, can yield lower approximation error than orthogonalizing
point sets. Finally, we compare the performance of adaptive Gaussian process
regression and adaptive pseudospectral approximation for several classes of
target functions, identifying features that are favorable to the GP + IVAR
approach.

by Basu & Jones (2004), and applies it to model the stellar initial mass
function (IMF). The distribution arises simply from an initial lognormal
distribution, requiring that each object in it subsequently undergoes
exponential growth but with an exponential distribution of growth lifetimes.
This leads to a modified lognormal with a power-law tail (MLP) distribution,
which can in fact be applied to a wide range of fields where distributions are
observed to have a lognormal-like body and a power-law tail. We derive
important properties of the MLP distribution, like the cumulative distribution,
the mean, variance, arbitrary raw moments, and a random number generator. These
analytic properties of the distribution can be used to facilitate application
to modeling the IMF. We demonstrate how the MLP function provides an excellent
fit to the IMF compiled by Chabrier (2005) and how this fit can be used to
quickly identify quantities like the mean, median, and mode, as well as number
and mass fractions in different mass intervals.

that go far beyond the usually studied energy exchange in the dark sector. In
the absence of known microscopic interaction mechanisms, phenomenological
ansatzes are usually proposed in order to describe such models. In this paper,
we derive a generalization of one of the most frequently used of such
ansatzes:the one based on a initial proposal of Shapiro, Sol\`a, Espa\~na-Bonet
and Ruiz-Lapuente who described a time-dependent cosmological ""constant"" whose
variation arises from quantum effects near the Planck scale [I. L. Shapiro, J.
Sol\`a, C. Espa\~na-Bonet, and P. Ruiz-Lapuente, (2003). This physically
motivated model was based on a single free parameter $\nu$, and was
subsequently studied by Wang and Meng (2005), under the pure phenomenological
reasoning that the vacuum decay would slightly modify the exponent describing
how the energy density of dark matter decreases with the scale factor. This
modification is described by a single parameter $\varepsilon$ (= 3 $\nu$ of the
former paper). The generalization derived in the present article requires two
free parameters ($\varepsilon_{1}$, $\varepsilon_{2}$). We show that this
extension is dynamically equivalent to the ansatz proposed by Barrow and
Clifton (2006) which deals with the transfer of energy between any two fluids
using a two-parameter scheme ($\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$) and that has the
advantage of exhibiting explicitly the form of the interaction factor appearing
in the continuity equation of each fluid.

represented as a Lagrangian structure, exerting point forces on the fluid. The
forces on the structure are often determined by a bending or tension model,
previously calculated using finite difference approximations. In this paper, we
study Spherical Basis Function (SBF), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and
Lagrange-Chebyshev parametric models to represent and calculate forces on
elastic structures that can be represented by an open curve, motivated by the
study of cilia and flagella. The evaluation error for static open curves for
the different interpolants, as well as errors for calculating normals and
second derivatives using different types of clustered parametric nodes, are
given for the case of an open planar curve. We determine that SBF and RBF
interpolants built on clustered nodes are competitive with Lagrange-Chebyshev

discretization error of a non-standard finite difference scheme applied to
boundary value problems defined on an infinite interval. In particular, we show
how Richardson's extrapolation can be used to improve the numerical solution
involving the order of accuracy and numerical solutions from two nested
quasi-uniform grids. A benchmark problem is examined for which the exact
solution is known and we get the following result: if the round-off error is
negligible and the grids are sufficiently fine then the Richardson's error
estimate gives an upper bound of the global error.

data instance to a human analyst, who then must determine whether the instance
is truly of interest (e.g. a threat in a security setting). Unfortunately, most
anomaly detectors provide no explanation about why an instance was considered
anomalous, leaving the analyst with no guidance about where to begin the
investigation. To address this issue, we study the problems of computing and
evaluating sequential feature explanations (SFEs) for anomaly detectors. An SFE
of an anomaly is a sequence of features, which are presented to the analyst one
at a time (in order) until the information contained in the highlighted
features is enough for the analyst to make a confident judgement about the
anomaly. Since analyst effort is related to the amount of information that they
consider in an investigation, an explanation's quality is related to the number
of features that must be revealed to attain confidence. One of our main
contributions is to present a novel framework for large scale quantitative
evaluations of SFEs, where the quality measure is based on analyst effort. To
do this we construct anomaly detection benchmarks from real data sets along
with artificial experts that can be simulated for evaluation. Our second
contribution is to evaluate several novel explanation approaches within the
framework and on traditional anomaly detection benchmarks, offering several
insights into the approaches.

Current methods for image upsampling tend to produce high-resolution images
with either blurry salient edges, or loss of fine textural detail, or spurious
noise artifacts.
  In our method, we mitigate these effects by modeling the input image as a sum
of edge and detail layers, operating upon these layers separately, and merging
the upscaled results in an automatic fashion. We formulate the upsampled output
image as the solution to a non-convex energy minimization problem, and propose
an algorithm to obtain a tractable approximate solution. Our algorithm
comprises two main stages. 1) For the edge layer, we use a nonparametric
approach by constructing a dictionary of patches from a given image, and
synthesize edge regions in a higher-resolution version of the image. 2) For the
detail layer, we use a global parametric texture enhancement approach to
synthesize detail regions across the image.
  We demonstrate that our method is able to accurately reproduce sharp edges as
well as synthesize photorealistic textures, while avoiding common artifacts
such as ringing and haloing. In addition, our method involves no training phase
or estimation of model parameters, and is easily parallelizable. We demonstrate
the utility of our method on a number of challenging standard test photos.

nonmonotonic logic that accommodates fully the syntax of a standard temporal
logic (specifically LTL) without requiring further constructions. This paper
provides a systematic complexity analysis for the (consistency) problem of
checking the existence of a temporal equilibrium model of a TEL formula. It was
previously shown that this problem in the general case lies somewhere between
PSPACE and EXPSPACE. Here we establish a lower bound matching the known
EXPSPACE upper bound. Additionally we analyse the complexity for various
natural subclasses of TEL formulas, identifying both tractable and intractable
fragments. Finally the paper offers some new insights on the logic LTL by
addressing satisfiability for minimal LTL models. The complexity results

using a semi-analytic method to explore the new measurements of the 21 cm power
spectrum from the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER), which were presented in a companion paper, Ali et al.
(2015). Twenty-one cm power spectra with amplitudes of hundreds of mK^2 can be
generically produced if the kinetic temperature of the IGM is significantly
below the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB); as such, the
new results from PAPER place lower limits on the IGM temperature at z=8.4.
Allowing for the unknown ionization state of the IGM, our measurements find the
IGM temperature to be above ~5 K for neutral fractions between 10% and 85%,
above ~7 K for neutral fractions between 15% and 80%, or above ~10 K for
neutral fractions between 30% and 70%. We also calculate the heating of the IGM
that would be provided by the observed high redshift galaxy population, and
find that for most models, these galaxies are sufficient to bring the IGM
temperature above our lower limits. However, there are significant ranges of
parameter space that could produce a signal ruled out by the PAPER
measurements; models with a steep drop-off in the star formation rate density
at high redshifts or with relatively low values for the X-ray to star formation
rate efficiency of high redshift galaxies are generally disfavored. The PAPER
measurements are consistent with (but do not constrain) a hydrogen spin
temperature above the CMB temperature, a situation which we find to be
generally predicted if galaxies fainter than the current detection limits of
optical/NIR surveys are included in calculations of X-ray heating.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from a combination of X-ray surveys from the
all-sky Swift BAT survey to the Chandra Deep Field-South. We use ~3200 AGNs in
our analysis, which covers six orders of magnitude in flux. The inclusion of
the XMM and Chandra COSMOS data has allowed us to investigate the detailed
behavior of the XLF and evolution. In deriving our XLF, we take into account
realistic AGN spectrum templates, absorption corrections, and probability
density distributions in photometric redshift. We present an analytical
expression for the overall behavior of the XLF in terms of the
luminosity-dependent density evolution, smoothed two power-law expressions in
11 redshift shells, three-segment power-law expression of the number density
evolution in four luminosity classes, and binned XLF. We observe a sudden
flattening of the low luminosity end slope of the XLF slope at z>~0.6. Detailed
structures of the AGN downsizing have been also revealed, where the number
density curves have two clear breaks at all luminosity classes above log LX>43.
The two break structure is suggestive of two-phase AGN evolution, consisting of
major merger triggering and secular processes.

30% of sub-Saturn-size exoplanets with orbital periods as long as 20 days, and
a simple BLS power criterion robustly distinguishes approximately 98% of these

conditions. For any $s$ with $0\leq s < 5/2$ and $s \not = 3/2$, it is shown
that the relevant IBVPs are locally well-posed if the initial data lie in the
$L^2$--based Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^+) $ in the case of the half line
and in $H^s (0, L)$ on a bounded interval, provided the boundary data are
selected from $H^{(2s+1)/4}_{loc} (\mathbb{R}^+)$ and $H^{(s+ 1) /2}_{loc}
(\mathbb{R}^+)$, respectively. (For $s > \frac12$, compatibility between the
initial and boundary conditions is also needed.) Global well-posedness is also
discussed when $s \ge 1$. From the point of view of the well-posedness theory,
the results obtained reveal a significant difference between the IBVP posed on

theory for the pure initial-value problem (IVP) for these Schr\""odinger

particular, the regularity demanded of the boundary data for the IBVP on

solutions of the pure IVP on $\mathbb{R}$, while the slightly higher regularity
of boundary data for the IBVP on $(0, L)$ resembles what is found for temporal

enhance the ordinary Stochastic Gradient Descent approach in CNN training with
a robust sample selection mechanism. The sampling mechanism randomly generates
positive and negative samples from different temporal distributions, which are
generated by taking the temporal relations and label noise into account.
Finally, a lazy yet effective updating scheme is designed for CNN training.
Equipped with this novel updating algorithm, the CNN model is robust to some
long-existing difficulties in visual tracking such as occlusion or incorrect
detections, without loss of the effective adaption for significant appearance

Then there are two models for the flag space of $G$: the complex quotient

the map $\tilde{\mathbf k}\colon G/B\to K/T$ induced by factorization in $G$
relative to the Iwasawa decomposition $G=KAN$, where $N$ is the nilradical of

Bott-Samelson resolution of $\mathbf k(\overline{X_w})$ which is constructed as

the most intense peaks appear in the diagonal, and quite often due to its broad
dispersive tails obscure the useful cross peaks close to the diagonal. Herein,
we demonstrate that by editing the 1H magnetization by a C-13 nucleus in
natural abundance before starting the t1 evolution, it is possible to
discriminate the inphase 1H magnetizations that leads to the diagonal peaks
from the antiphase 1H magnetizations that generates the cross peaks. The 1H
magnetization is edited by a C-13 nucleus in natural abundance before starting
the t1 period in COSY. After the coherence transfer, the inphase transverse
magnetization directly attached to C-13 evolves under one bond heteronuclear
coupling for a time period 2{\tau} tuned to one bond heteronuclear coupling
while the antiphase transeverse magnetization directly attached to remote C-12
evolves under negligible long range heteronuclear couplings. As a result the
inphase magnetization can be eliminated as an unobservable heteronuclear
multiple quantum coherence leading to a diagonal free correlated spectrum. The
method is demonstrated for COSY.

the complexity of integer-pixel search has been greatly reduced by fast

engineering, which has been widely studied in the last decades. However,
modelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box services
remain an open research problem. Software services, such as Web services and
Web APIs, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the
Internet, thus leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability
analysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only
on the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g.,
service workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models
become ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by
blackbox services, in this paper, we propose CARP, a new contextaware
reliability prediction approach, which leverages historical usage data from
users to construct context-aware reliability models and further provides online
reliability prediction results to users. Through context-aware reliability
modelling, CARP is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily
limits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches. The preliminary
evaluation results show that CARP can make a significant improvement in
reliability prediction accuracy, e.g., about 41% in MAE and 38% in RMSE when
only 5% of the data are available.

The linear combination assumes that all the features are in a linear

in an linear manner, which might limit the expressive power of the model and
lead to a under-fit model on the current data. In this paper, we propose a
non-linear modeling for the quality of translation hypotheses based on neural

possible heuristics in designing the network structure which may improve the
non-linear learning performance. Experimental results show that with the basic

produce translations that are better than a linear model.

universe with a very small number of free parameters, which can be determined
with high accuracy from currently available data. However, this does not mean
that the associated physical quantities, such as the curvature of the universe,
have been directly measured. Similarly, general relativity is assumed, but not
tested. Testing the relevance of general relativity for cosmology at the
background level includes a verification of the relation between its energy
contents and the curvature of space. Using an extended Newtonian formulation,
we propose an approach where this relation can be tested. Using the recent
measurements on cosmic microwave background, baryonic acoustic oscillations and
the supernova Hubble diagram, we show that the prediction of general relativity
is well verified in the framework of standard $\Lambda$CDM assumptions, i.e. an
energy content only composed of matter and dark energy, in the form of a
cosmological constant or equivalently a vacuum contribution.
  However, the actual equation of state of dark fluids cannot be directly
obtained from cosmological observations. We found that relaxing the equation of
state of dark energy opens a large region of possibilities, revealing a new
type of degeneracy between the curvature and the total energy content of the
universe.

Firstly, using Boucksom's divisorial Zariski decompositions for

differentiability of volumes of big classes for K\""ahler manifolds on which
modified nef cones and nef cones coincide; this includes K\""ahler surfaces. We
then apply our differentiability results to prove Demailly's transcendental
Morse inequality for these particular classes of K\""ahler manifolds. In the
second part, we construct the convex body $\Delta(\alpha)$ for any big class
$\alpha$ with respect to a fixed flag by using positive currents, and prove
that this newly defined convex body coincides with the Okounkov body when
$\alpha\in {\rm NS}\_{\mathbb{R}}(X)$; such convex sets $\Delta(\alpha)$ will
be called generalized Okounkov bodies. As an application we prove that any
rational point in the interior of Okounkov bodies is ""valuative"". Next we give
a complete characterisation of generalized Okounkov bodies on surfaces, and
show that the generalized Okounkov bodies behave very similarly to original
Okounkov bodies. By the differentiability formula, we can relate the standard
Euclidean volume of $\Delta(\alpha)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the volume of a big
class $\alpha$, as defined by Boucksom; this solves a problem raised by
Lazarsfeld in the case of surfaces. Finally, we study the behavior of the
generalized Okounkov bodies on the boundary of the big cone, which are

in surveillance profile of AVS2 video coding standard (surveillance profile).
Our tool includes three schemes: direct-coding scheme, differential- coding
scheme, and reconstructed-coding scheme. We will illustrate the details of
these schemes, and perform analysis of their advantages and disadvantages,

conventional rate-control algorithms, the number and position of Macroblocks
(MBs) inside one basic unit for rate-control is inflexible and predetermined.
The different characteristics of the MBs are not fully considered. Also, there
is no overall optimization of the coding of basic units. This paper proposes a
new region-based rate-control scheme for H.264/AVC to improve the coding
efficiency. The inter-frame information is explored to objectively divide one
frame into multiple regions based on their rate-distortion behaviors. The MBs
with the similar characteristics are classified into the same region, and the
entire region instead of a single MB or a group of contiguous MBs is treated as
a basic unit for rate-control. A linear rate-quantization stepsize model and a
linear distortion-quantization stepsize model are proposed to accurately
describe the rate-distortion characteristics for the region-based basic units.
Moreover, based on the above linear models, an overall optimization model is
proposed to obtain suitable Quantization Parameters (QPs) for the region-based
basic units. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed region-based
rate-control approach can achieve both better subjective and objective quality
by performing the rate-control adaptively with the content, compared to the
conventional rate-control approaches.

spin-orbit coupling mixes states with different parities, which inspires us to
approximate the single particle state with the eigenstates of the total angular
momentum, i.e. superposition of harmonic $s$-wave and $p$-wave states. As the
time reversal symmetry is protected by two-body interaction, we set the
variational order parameter as the combination of two mutually time reversal
symmetric eigenstates of the total angular momentum. The variational results
essentially reproduce the 3D skyrmion-like ground state recently identified by
Kawakami {\it et al.}. We show that these skyrmion-like ground states emerging
in this model are primarily caused by $p$ wave spatial mode involving in the
variational order parameter that drives two spin components spatially
separated. We find the ground state of this system falls into two phases with
different density distribution symmetries depending on the relative magnitude
of intraspecies and interspecies interaction: Phase I has parity symmetric and
axisymmetric density distributions, while Phase II is featured with special
joint symmetries of discrete rotational and time reversal symmetry. With the
increasing interaction strength the transition occurs between two phases with
distinct density distributions, while the topological 3D skyrmion-like spin
texture is symmetry protected.

locality axiom of general local covariance, which states that a causal
embedding between spacetimes should induce an inclusion at the level of
observables. Both at the classical and at the quantum level, it turns out that
the models we consider violate locality depending on certain global features of
the background spacetime. For Maxwell $k$-forms, we prove that there is no
coherent way to recover the locality axiom. For the $U(1)$ Yang-Mills model we
adopt two different approaches: in the first one locality can be recovered
coherently, but the class of observables we consider fails in detecting those
field configurations which correspond to the Aharonov-Bohm effect; conversely,
in our second approach observables are defined in the spirit of Wilson loops
(hence capturing also Aharonov-Bohm configurations), but a no-go theorem shows
that locality cannot be recovered in a coherent way.

Then, new/old ordering inversions are eliminated by the use of a (bounded)

register. A practically stabilizing Byzantine single-writer multi-reader (SWMR)
atomic register is then obtained by using several copies of SWSR atomic

with SWMR atomic registers, are used to construct a practically stabilizing
Byzantine multi-writer multi-reader (MWMR) atomic register. In a system of $n$
servers implementing an atomic register, and in addition to transient failures,
the constructions tolerate t<n/8 Byzantine servers if communication is
asynchronous, and t<n/3 Byzantine servers if it is synchronous. The noteworthy
feature of the proposed algorithms is that (to our knowledge) these are the
first that build an atomic read/write storage on top of asynchronous servers
prone to transient failures, and where up to t of them can be Byzantine.

both models the particle and loop excitations have the same mutual braiding

considers the recently proposed three-loop braiding process in which one loop
is braided around another while both are linked to a third loop. We find that
the statistical phase associated with this process is different in the two

feature of this work is that we derive our results using a concrete approach:

do 7 to 10 orders of magnitude better, on the ground or in space. They are
limited by the random shot noise, which depends on the number N of atoms in the
clouds. As mass-dropping experiments in the non-uniform gravitational field of
Earth, they are sensitive to the initial conditions. Random accelerations due
to initial condition errors of the clouds are designed to be at the same level
as shot noise, so that they can be reduced with the number of drops along with
it. This sets the requirements for the initial position and velocity spreads of
the clouds with given N. In the STE-QUEST space mission proposal aiming at
2x10^-15 they must be about a factor 8 above Heisenberg's principle limit, and
the integration time required to reduce both errors is 3 years, with a mission
duration of 5 years. Instead, offset errors at release between different atom
clouds are systematic and give rise to a systematic effect which mimics a
violation. Such offsets must be demonstrated to be as small as required in all
drops, must be small by design and must be measured. For STE-QUEST to meet its
goal they must be several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of each
individual cloud, which in its turn must be at most 8 times larger than the
uncertainty principle limit. Even if all technical problems are solved and the
clouds are released with negligible systematic errors, still they must be
measured. Then, Heisenberg's principle dictates that the measurement lasts as
long as the experiment and the systematic nature of the effect requires many
measurements for it to be ruled out as a source of violation.

related tasks. In practice, due to the pile-up effect of the detector, it's
difficult to directly measure the spectrum of a CT scanner using an energy
resolved detector. An alternative solution is to estimate the spectrum using
transmission measurements with a step phantom or other CT phantom. In this
work, we present a new spectrum estimation method based on indirect
transmission measurement and model spectra mixture approach. The estimated
x-ray spectrum was expressed as weighted summation of a set of model spectra,
which can significantly reduce the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the spectrum
estimation problem. Next, an estimated projection can be calculated with the
assumed spectrum. By iteratively updating the unknown weights, we minimized the
difference between the estimated projection data and the raw projection data.
The final spectrum was calculated with these calibrated weights and the model
spectra. Both simulation and experimental data were used to evaluate the
proposed method. In the simulation study, the estimated spectra were compared
to the raw spectra which were used to generate the raw projection data. For the
experimental study, the ground truth measurement of the raw x-ray spectrum was
not available. Therefore, the estimated spectrum was compared against spectra
generated using the SpekCalc software with tube configurations provided by the
scanner manufacturer. The results show the proposed method has potential to
accurately estimate x-ray spectra using the raw projection data. The difference
between the mean energy of the raw spectra and the mean energy of the estimated
spectra were smaller than 0.5 keV for both simulation and experimental data.
Further tests show the method was robust with respect to the model spectra
generator.

been previously described in detail (ibid.); here, validation for the BSs of
the 4 other ligands shows both good specificity and sensitivity. Of the 801
structures screened, 8 tested positive for GTP binding, 61 for ATP binding, 35
for SIA binding, 132 for REA binding, 33 for hNO binding, and 10 for fNO
binding. Using the cutting plane and tangent sphere methods we described
previously, (Reyes, V.M., 2015b), we also determined the depth of burial of the
LBSs detected above and compared the values with those from the respective
training structures, and the degree of similarity between the two values taken
as a further validation of the predicted LBSs. Applying this criterion, we were
able to narrow down the predicted GTP-binding proteins to 2, the ATP-binding
proteins to 13, the SIA-binding proteins to 2, the REA-binding proteins to 14,
the hNO-binding proteins to 4, and the fNO-binding proteins to 1. We believe
this further criterion increases the confidence level of our LBS predictions.
