one of the best motivated ways to account for the observed neutrino masses. We
discuss the expected sensitivity of future lepton collider experiments for
probing such extensions. An interesting testable scenario is given by 'symmetry
protected seesaw models', which theoretically allow for sterile neutrino masses
around the electroweak scale with up to order one mixings with the light (SM)
neutrinos. In addition to indirect tests, e.g. via electroweak precision
observables, sterile neutrinos with masses around the electroweak scale can
also be probed by direct searches, e.g. via sterile neutrino decays at the Z
pole, deviations from the SM cross section for four lepton final states at and
beyond the WW threshold and via Higgs boson decays. We study the present bounds
on sterile neutrino properties from LEP and LHC as well as the expected
sensitivities of possible future lepton colliders such as ILC, CEPC and FCC-ee

both full potential effects and electron correlations treated within dynamical

exhibits a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy for a range of cobalt concentrations
between $x=0.1$ and $x=0.5$. A simple model for the temperature dependence of
magnetic anisotropy suggests that the complicated non-monotonous temperature
behaviour is mainly due to variations in the band structure as the exchange
splitting is reduced by temperature. Using density functional theory based
calculations we have explored the effect of substitutional doping the
transition metal sublattice by the whole range of 5$d$ transition metals and
found that doping by Re or W elements should significantly enhance the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Experimentally, W doping did not succeed
in enhancing the magnetic anisotropy due to formation of other phases. On the
other hand, doping by Ir and Re was successful and resulted in magnetic
anisotropies that are in agreement with theoretical predictions. In particular,
doping by 2.5~at.\% of Re on the Fe/Co site shows a magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy which is increased by 50\% compared to its parent

successful mathematical model for data representation that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as pattern recognition,
machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging. The original
formulation for DLSR is based on the minimization of the reconstruction error
between the original signal and its sparse representation in the space of the
learned dictionary. Although this formulation is optimal for solving problems
such as denoising, inpainting, and coding, it may not lead to optimal solution
in classification tasks, where the ultimate goal is to make the learned
dictionary and corresponding sparse representation as discriminative as
possible. This motivated the emergence of a new category of techniques, which
is appropriately called supervised dictionary learning and sparse
representation (S-DLSR), leading to more optimal dictionary and sparse
representation in classification tasks. Despite many research efforts for
S-DLSR, the literature lacks a comprehensive view of these techniques, their
connections, advantages and shortcomings. In this paper, we address this gap
and provide a review of the recently proposed algorithms for S-DLSR. We first
present a taxonomy of these algorithms into six categories based on the
approach taken to include label information into the learning of the dictionary
and/or sparse representation. For each category, we draw connections between
the algorithms in this category and present a unified framework for them. We
then provide guidelines for applied researchers on how to represent and learn

selection, which combined constitute a powerful framework for classification,
as well as data visualization and interpretation. However, current proposed
combinations lead to instable and non convergent methods due to inappropriate
computational frameworks. We hereby propose a stable and convergent approach
for classification in high dimensional based on sparse Partial Least Squares
(sparse PLS). Results: We start by proposing a new solution for the sparse PLS
problem that is based on proximal operators for the case of univariate
responses. Then we develop an adaptive version of the sparse PLS for
classification, which combines iterative optimization of logistic regression
and sparse PLS to ensure convergence and stability. Our results are confirmed
on synthetic and experimental data. In particular we show how crucial
convergence and stability can be when cross-validation is involved for
calibration purposes. Using gene expression data we explore the prediction of
breast cancer relapse. We also propose a multicategorial version of our method
on the prediction of cell-types based on single-cell expression data.

component of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm

algorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost
constant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the
algorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts
simultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and
the competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al.

three-body decay $\tilde{t}_1\to W b \tilde{\chi}_1^0$ is kinematically allowed
and provide a proper description of the transition region between the
three-body decay and the four-body decay $\tilde{t}_1 \to\tilde{\chi}_1^0 b f
\bar{f}'$. The improved treatment has been implemented in the Fortran package

parameter range including all relevant experimental constraints reveals that
the FV two-body decay into charm and $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ can be as important as
the three-, respectively, four-body decays if not dominant and therefore should
be taken into account in order to complete the experimental searches for the
light stop.

due to the passive way the data are collected. The majority of associations

  The focus of this paper is to investigate incorporating information from
additional databases to complement the longitudinal observational database
analysis. We investigate the detection of prescription drug side effects as
this is an example of a causal relationship. In previous work a framework was
proposed for detecting side effects only using longitudinal data. In this paper
we combine a measure of association derived from mining a spontaneous reporting
system database to previously proposed analysis that extracts domain expertise
features for causal analysis of a UK general practice longitudinal database.
  The results show that there is a significant improvement to the performance
of detecting prescription drug side effects when the longitudinal observation
data analysis is complemented by incorporating additional drug safety sources
into the framework. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) for correctly classifying a side effect when other data were considered
was 0.967, whereas without it the AUC was 0.923 However, the results of this
paper may be biased by the evaluation and future work should overcome this by
developing an unbiased reference set.

AIA/SDO during the first 3.5 years of its mission. In this Paper II we compute
the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution functions and associated
multi-thermal energies, using a spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM
forward-fitting method. The multi-thermal DEM function yields a significantly
higher (by an average factor of $\approx 14$), but more comprehensive
(multi-)thermal energy than an isothermal energy estimate from the same AIA
data. We find a statistical energy ratio of $E_{th}/E_{diss} \approx 2\%-40\%$
between the multi-thermal energy $E_{th}$ and the magnetically dissipated
energy $E_{diss}$, which is an order of magnitude higher than the estimates of
Emslie et al.~2012. For the analyzed set of M and X-class flares we find the
following physical parameter ranges: $L=10^{8.2}-10^{9.7}$ cm for the length
scale of the flare areas, $T_p=10^{5.7}-10^{7.4}$ K for the DEM peak
temperature, $T_w=10^{6.8}-10^{7.6}$ K for the emission measure-weighted
temperature, $n_p=10^{10.3}-10^{11.8}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the average electron
density, $EM_p=10^{47.3}-10^{50.3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the DEM peak emission
measure, and $E_{th}=10^{26.8}-10^{32.0}$ erg for the multi-thermal energies.
The deduced multi-thermal energies are consistent with the RTV scaling law
$E_{th,RTV} = 7.3 \times 10^{-10} \ T_p^3 L_p^2$, which predicts extremal
values of $E_{th,max} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{33}$ erg for the largest flare and
$E_{th,min} \approx 1 \times 10^{24}$ erg for the smallest coronal nanoflare.
The size distributions of the spatial parameters exhibit powerlaw tails that
are consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized

healthcare databases present the opportunity to identify new side effects

associated to a third variable).
  In this paper we propose a proof of concept method that learns common
associations and uses this knowledge to automatically refine side effect
signals (i.e. exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the
exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the
signal instances that are most likely to correspond to true side effect
occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted
risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the
outcome within 60 days of the exposure.
  Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i.e.
exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the
majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely to correspond to true
side effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule
mining parameters for specific health outcomes.
  This paper shows that it may be possible to filter signals at a patient level
based on association rules learned from considering patients' medical
histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate
the tuning of the method's parameters.

involve eigenvalues, we present a particular structure of the singular values
of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE): the even-location singular values
are distributed as the positive eigenvalues of a Gaussian ensemble with chiral
unitary symmetry (anti-GUE), while the odd-location singular values,
conditioned on the even-location ones, can be algebraically transformed into a
set of independent $\chi$-distributed random variables. We discuss three
applications of this structure: first, there is a pair of bidiagonal square
matrices, whose singular values are jointly distributed as the even- and
odd-location ones of the GOE; second, the magnitude of the determinant of the
GOE is distributed as a product of simple independent random variables; third,
on symmetric intervals, the gap probabilities of the GOE can be expressed in
terms of the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). We work specifically with
matrices of finite order, but by passing to a large matrix limit, we also
obtain new insight into asymptotic properties such as the central limit theorem
of the determinant or the gap probabilities in the bulk-scaling limit. The
analysis in this paper avoids much of the technical machinery (e.g. Pfaffians,
skew-orthogonal polynomials, martingales, Meijer $G$-function, etc.) that was
previously used to analyze some of the applications.

dynamical decoupling, whereby the qubit is subjected to a carefully timed

understanding the behavior is to analyse the degree of suppression of the
usually dominant contribution from independent pairs of flip-flopping spins
within the many-body quantum bath. We find that to simulate recently measured
Hahn echo decays at OWPs (lowest-order dynamical decoupling), one must consider
clusters of three interacting spins, since independent pairs do not even give
finite $T_2$ decay times. We show that while operating near OWPs, dynamical
decoupling sequences require hundreds of pulses for a single order of magnitude
enhancement of $T_2$, in contrast to regimes far from OWPs, where only about
ten pulses are required.

realized that, to estimate the free parameters of a theoretical model, by
regarding the systematic errors it better the whole of the above observational
data sets to be considered. In fact, if one considers SNeIa, CMB and BAO but

state proportional to the number of distinct keys, and therefore we are
interested in estimating these statistics or more generally, sampling the data,
without aggregation. We present a sampling framework for unaggregated data that
uses a single pass (for streams) or two passes (for distributed data) and state
proportional to the desired sample size. Our design provides the first
effective solution for general frequency cap statistics. Our $\ell$-capped
samples provide estimates with tight statistical guarantees for cap statistics
with $T=\Theta(\ell)$ and nonnegative unbiased estimates of {\em any} monotone
non-decreasing frequency statistics. An added benefit of our unified design is
facilitating {\em multi-objective samples}, which provide estimates with
statistical guarantees for a specified set of different statistics, using a
single, smaller sample.

Submitted to A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201525936",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present foreground-reduced CMB maps derived from the full Planck data set
in both temperature and polarization. Compared to the corresponding Planck 2013
temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 for
frequencies between 30 and 70 GHz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and
857 GHz. In addition, systematic errors in the forms of
temperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversion
uncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramatically
reduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now be
robustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. On the very largest
scales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared to
the expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell < 20$ are accordingly
suppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. As in 2013,
four different CMB component separation algorithms are applied to these
observations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic and
modelling choices. The resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noise
ranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{K}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,
and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{K}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. The
cosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectra
are in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the Planck 2015 likelihood.
Unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulations
prevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical properties
of the polarization maps. Thus, the primary applications of these polarization
maps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimation
of uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra and
cross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

astronomy, allowing observatories, scientists and the public to exchange
astronomical information easily. The FITS standard is, however, showing its
age. Developed in the late 1970s the FITS authors made a number of
implementation choices for the format that, while common at the time, are now
seen to limit its utility with modern data. The authors of the FITS standard
could not appreciate the challenges which we would be facing today in
astronomical computing. Difficulties we now face include, but are not limited
to, having to address the need to handle an expanded range of specialized data
product types (data models), being more conducive to the networked exchange and
storage of data, handling very large datasets and the need to capture
significantly more complex metadata and data relationships.
  There are members of the community today who find some (or all) of these
limitations unworkable, and have decided to move ahead with storing data in
other formats. This reaction should be taken as a wakeup call to the FITS
community to make changes in the FITS standard, or to see its usage fall. In
this paper we detail some selected important problems which exist within the
FITS standard today. It is not our intention to prescribe specific remedies to
these issues; rather, we hope to call attention of the FITS and greater
astronomical computing communities to these issues in the hopes that it will
spur action to address them.

the system enters a three-sublattice long-range ordered state, with each
triangle having vanishing dipole and quadrupole moments; while for dominating
dipolar interactions we uncover ferrimagnetic three-sublattice order. These are
also the ground states for XY spins. We discuss excitations of, as well as
phase transitions into, these states. We find behaviour consistent with Ising
criticality for the 120-degree state, while the ferrimagnetic state appears to
be associated with drifting exponents. The celebrated flat band of zero-energy

finite energies but acquires only minimal dispersion as dipolar interactions

Storm, Streaming MapReduce), we investigate the problem of scheduling graphs
over a large cluster of servers. Each graph is a job, where nodes represent
compute tasks and edges indicate data-flows between these compute tasks. Jobs
(graphs) arrive randomly over time, and upon completion, leave the system. When
a job arrives, the scheduler needs to partition the graph and distribute it
over the servers to satisfy load balancing and cost considerations.
Specifically, neighboring compute tasks in the graph that are mapped to
different servers incur load on the network; thus a mapping of the jobs among
the servers incurs a cost that is proportional to the number of ""broken edges"".
We propose a low complexity randomized scheduling algorithm that, without
service preemptions, stabilizes the system with graph arrivals/departures; more
importantly, it allows a smooth trade-off between minimizing average
partitioning cost and average queue lengths. Interestingly, to avoid service
preemptions, our approach does not rely on a Gibbs sampler; instead, we show
that the corresponding limiting invariant measure has an interpretation
stemming from a loss system.

Copper-octabromo-tetraphenylporphyrin molecules can diffuse and self-assemble
when adsorbed on the inert Au(111) surface. Splitting-off of bromine atoms
bonded at the macrocyclic core of the porphyrin starts at room temperature
after the deposition and is monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for
different annealing steps. Direct coupling between the reactive carbon sites of
the molecules is, however, hindered by the molecular shape. This leads
initially to an ordered non-covalently interconnected supramolecular structure.
Further heating to 300{\deg}C and an additional hydrogen dissociation step is
required to link the molecular macrocycles via a phenyl group and form large
ordered polymeric networks. This approach leads to a close-packed covalently
bonded network of overall good quality. The structures are characterized using
scanning tunneling microscopy. Different kinds of lattice defects and,
furthermore, the impact of polymerization on the HOMO-LUMO gap are discussed.
Density functional theory calculations corroborate the interpretations and give
further insight into the adsorption of the debrominated molecule on the surface
and the geometry and coupling reaction of the polymeric structure.

subalgebra of supersymmetry. We study compensating boundary actions for
$\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry in 4d, and show that they are determined
independently of the details of the theory and of the boundary conditions. Two
distinct classes of boundary actions exist, which correspond to preserving
either a linear combination of supercharges of opposite chirality (called
A-type) or supercharges of opposite chirality independently (B-type). The first
option preserves a subalgebra isomorphic to $\mathcal{N} = 1$ in 3d, while the
second preserves only a 2d subgroup of the Lorentz symmetry and a subalgebra
isomorphic to $\mathcal{N} = (0,2)$ in 2d. These subalgebras are in one to one

Bursting Pulsar, GRO J1744-28, during its third detected outburst since
discovery and after nearly 18 years of quiescence. The source is detected up to
60 keV with an Eddington persistent flux level. Seven bursts, followed by dips,
are seen with Chandra, three of which are also detected with NuSTAR. Timing
analysis reveals a slight increase in the persistent emission pulsed fraction
with energy (from 10% to 15%) up to 10 keV, above which it remains constant.
The 0.5-70 keV spectra of the persistent and dip emission are the same within
errors, and well described by a blackbody (BB), a power-law with an exponential
rolloff, a 10 keV feature, and a 6.7 keV emission feature, all modified by
neutral absorption. Assuming that the BB emission originates in an accretion
disc, we estimate its inner (magnetospheric) radius to be about 4x10^7 cm,
which translates to a surface dipole field B~9x10^10 G. The Chandra/HETG
spectrum resolves the 6.7 keV feature into (quasi-)neutral and highly ionized
Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines. XSTAR modeling shows these lines to also
emanate from a truncated accretion disk. The burst spectra, with a peak flux
more than an order of magnitude higher than Eddington, are well fit with a
power-law with an exponential rolloff and a 10~keV feature, with similar fit
values compared to the persistent and dip spectra. The burst spectra lack a
thermal component and any Fe features. Anisotropic (beamed) burst emission
would explain both the lack of the BB and any Fe components.

candidates, which extends out to 100 kpc, and we estimate a total population of
3000+/-300 GCs. Besides the well known blue and red subpopulations, the colour
distribution shows signs of the possible existence of a third subpopulation
with intermediate colours. This could be interpreted as evidence of a past
interaction or fusion event. Other signs of interactions presented by the
galaxy, are the non-concentric isophotes and the asymmetric spatial
distribution of GC candidates with colours (g'-i')_0>1.16. As observed in other
galaxies, the red GCs show a steeper radial distribution than the blue GCs. In
addition, the spatial distribution of these candidates exhibit strong signs of
elongation. This feature is also detected in the intermediate subpopulation. On
the other hand, the blue candidates show an excellent agreement with the X-ray
surface brightness profile, outside 10 kpc. They also show a colour-luminosity
relation (blue-tilt), similar to that observed in other galaxies. A new
distance modulus has been estimated through the blue subpopulation, which is in
good agreement with the previous value obtained through the surface brightness
fluctuations method. The specific frequency of NGC 6861 (Sn=10.6+/-2.1) is

the giant (~150 x 80 kpc) Ly-alpha halo around the z=4.1 radio galaxy TNJ
J1338-1942. This 9-hr observation maps the two-dimensional kinematics of the
Ly-alpha emission across the halo. We identify two HI absorbers which are seen
against the Ly-alpha emission, both of which cover the full 150 x 80 kpc extent
of the halo and so have covering fractions ~1. The stronger and more
blue-shifted absorber (dv~1200 km/s) has dynamics that mirror that of the
underlying halo emission and we suggest that this high column material (n(HI) ~
10^19.4 /cm^2), which is also seen in CIV absorption, represents an out-flowing
shell that has been driven by the AGN (or star formation) within the galaxy.
The weaker (n(HI)~10^14 /cm^2) and less blue shifted (dv~500 km/s) absorber
most likely represents material in the cavity between the out-flowing shell and
the Ly-alpha halo. We estimate that the mass in the shell must be of order
10^10 Msol -- a significant fraction of the ISM from a galaxy at z=4. The large
scales of these coherent structures illustrate the potentially powerful
influence of AGN feedback on the distribution and energetics of material in
their surroundings. Indeed, the discovery of high-velocity (~1000 km/s),
group-halo-scale (i.e. >150 kpc) and mass-loaded winds in the vicinity of the
central radio source are broadly in agreement with the requirements of models

associated with a newly discovered X-ray binary containing a massive neutron
star (nearly 2 M_sun) and a ~ 0.35 M_sun giant secondary with a 5.4 day period.
SOAR optical spectroscopy at a range of orbital phases reveals variable
double-peaked H-alpha emission, consistent with the presence of an accretion
disk. The lack of radio emission and evidence for a disk suggests the gamma-ray
emission is unlikely to originate in a pulsar magnetosphere, but could instead
be associated with a pulsar wind, relativistic jet, or could be due to
synchrotron self-Compton at the disk--magnetosphere boundary. Assuming a wind
or jet, the high ratio of gamma-ray to X-ray luminosity (~ 20) suggests
efficient production of gamma-rays, perhaps due to the giant companion. The
system appears to be a low-mass X-ray binary that has not yet completed the
pulsar recycling process. This system is a good candidate to monitor for a
future transition between accretion-powered and rotational-powered states, but
in the context of a giant secondary.

pseudoscalar to be relatively light and it is possible to obtain thermal relic
dark matter candidates even below 100 GeV. In particular, we find ample room to
obtain dark matter with mass around 50 GeV and fitting the Galactic Center

general method for the detection and localization of single-source GWs using

signals: monochromatic waves as expected from individual supermassive binary
black holes in circular orbits, GWs from eccentric binaries and GW bursts. We
also test its implementation in realistic data sets that include effects such
as uneven sampling and heterogeneous data spans and measurement precision. It
is shown that our method, which works in the frequency domain, performs as well
as published time-domain methods. In particular, we find it equivalent to the
$\mathcal{F}_{e}$-statistic for monochromatic waves. We also discuss the
construction of null streams -- data streams that have null response to GWs,
and the prospect of using null streams as a consistency check in the case of
detected GW signals. Finally, we present sensitivities to individual
supermassive binary black holes in eccentric orbits. We find that a
monochromatic search that is designed for circular binaries can efficiently
detect eccentric binaries with both high and low eccentricities, while a
harmonic summing technique provides greater sensitivities only for binaries
with moderate eccentricities.

that takes into account $\arg L$, to numerically compute non-trivial zeros of

Employing these numerical solutions, in particular for the $\zeta$-function, we
verify that the leading order asymptotic expansion is accurate enough to
numerically support Montgomery's and Odlyzko's pair correlation conjectures,

numerical solutions of the exact transcendental equation can determine the

Ramanujan $\tau$-function, which is closely related to the bosonic string

electronic radiation control thanks to the refractive index variation induced
by a carrier density change in the perturbations. To assess the electrical
modulation capability, we study carrier injection and depletion in Si
perturbations, and investigate the Franz-Keldysh effect in germanium as an
alternative way. We theoretically show that the silicon wire modulator has a -3
dB modulation bandwidth of 75 GHz with refractive index change of
$3\times10^{-4}$ in depletion mode, and 350 MHz bandwidth with refractive index
change of $1.5\times10^{-2}$ in injection mode. The Franz-Keldysh effect has

In this system, the magnetization $m_z$ is conserved to a very good

distribution for $m_z$ and constructing a generalized statistical ensemble that
preserves its first moments. In the limit of large particle numbers, we
construct the partition function at thermal equilibrium and use it to compute
various quantities of experimental interest, such as the probability

consistent application of these definitions to the assignment of instances to
classes are important criteria for ontology evaluation. If ontologies are
specified with property-based restrictions on class membership, then such
consistency can be checked automatically. If no such logical restrictions are
applied, as is the case with many biological ontologies, there are currently no
automated methods for measuring the semantic consistency of instance assignment
on an ontology-wide scale, nor for inferring the patterns of properties that
might define a particular class. We constructed a program that takes as its
input an OWL/RDF knowledge base containing an ontology, instances associated
with each of the classes in the ontology, and properties of those instances.
For each class, it outputs: 1) a rule for determining class membership based on
the properties of the instances and 2) a quantitative score for the class that
reflects the ability of the identified rule to correctly predict class
membership for the instances in the knowledge base. We evaluated this program
using both artificial knowledge bases of known quality and real, widely used
ontologies. The results indicate that the suggested method can be used to
conduct objective, automatic, data-driven evaluations of biological ontologies
without formal class definitions in regards to the property-based consistency
of instance-assignment. This inductive method complements existing, purely
deductive approaches to automatic consistency checking, offering not just the
potential to help in the ontology engineering process but also in the knowledge
discovery process.

existing approaches for implementing wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive
radios (CRs), such as reduced sampling rate and computational complexity.
However, there are two significant challenges: 1) choosing an appropriate
number of sub-Nyquist measurements, and 2) deciding when to terminate the
greedy recovery algorithm that reconstructs wideband spectrum. In this paper,
an autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that
enables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while
guaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery
error. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the
validation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with
high confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and
noisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm
is proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the
instantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap
between CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that
ACSS can not only recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of
measurements, but can also considerably improve the spectral recovery
performance compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery
algorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore
solving the problems of under-fitting or over-fitting which commonly exist in
most greedy recovery algorithms.

decentralized partially observable semi-Markov decision process (Dec-POSMDP).
The Dec-POSMDP formulation allows asynchronous decision-making by the robots,
which is crucial in multi-robot domains. We also present an algorithm for
solving this Dec-POSMDP which is much more scalable than previous methods since
it can incorporate closed-loop belief space macro-actions in planning. These
macro-actions are automatically constructed to produce robust solutions. The

The `shameful conjecture' due to Bartels and Welsh states that,
$$\frac{P_G(n)}{P_G(n-1)} \geq \frac{n^n}{(n-1)^n}.$$ Let $\mu(G)$ denote the
expected number of colors used in a uniformly random proper $n$-coloring of
$G$. The above inequality can be interpreted as saying that $\mu(G) \geq
\mu(O_n)$, where $O_n$ is the empty graph on $n$ nodes. This conjecture was
proved by F. M. Dong, who in fact showed that, $$\frac{P_G(q)}{P_G(q-1)} \geq
\frac{q^n}{(q-1)^n}$$ for all $q \geq n$. There are examples showing that this
inequality is not true for all $q \geq 2$. In this paper, we show that the
above inequality holds for all $q \geq 36D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the largest
degree of $G$. It is also shown that the above inequality holds true for all $q

2009ip remains brighter than its historic minimum from pre-discovery images.
Spectroscopically, SN 2009ip continues to be dominated by strong, narrow
($\lesssim$2000 km~s$^{-1}$) emission lines of H, He, Ca, and Fe. While we make
tenuous detections of [Fe~{\sc ii}] $\lambda$7155 and [O~{\sc i}]

within a day of explosion, hitherto unprecedented for Type II-L supernovae.
This motivated a comparative study of Type II-P and II-L supernovae with
relatively well-constrained explosion epochs and rise times to maximum
(optical) light. From our sample of twenty such events, we find evidence of a
positive correlation between the duration of the rise and the peak brightness.
On average, SNe II-L tend to have brighter peak magnitudes and longer rise
times than SNe II-P. However, this difference is clearest only at the extreme
ends of the rise time versus peak brightness relation. Using two different
analytical models, we performed a parameter study to investigate the physical
parameters that control the rise time behaviour. In general, the models
qualitatively reproduce aspects of the observed trends. We find that the
brightness of the optical peak increases for larger progenitor radii and
explosion energies, and decreases for larger masses. The dependence of the rise
time on mass and explosion energy is smaller than the dependence on the
progenitor radius. We find no evidence that the progenitors of SNe II-L have
significantly smaller radii than those of SNe II-P.

17$\%$ of the total solar surface area, and the total unsigned open flux varies
between $2-5 \times 10^{22}$ Mx. The solar cycle dependence of these
measurements are similar to the PFSS results, but the model yields larger hole
areas and greater open flux than observed by EIT. The AIA/EUVI measurements
from 2010-2013 show coronal hole area coverage of 5-10$\%$ of the total surface
area, with significant contribution from low latitudes, which is
under-represented by EIT. AIA/EUVI have measured much enhanced open magnetic
flux in the range of $2-4 \times 10^{22}$ Mx, which is about twice the flux
measured by EIT, and matches with the PFSS calculated open flux, with
discrepancies in the location and strength of coronal holes. A detailed
comparison between the three measurements (by EIT, AIA-EUVI, and PFSS)

total open magnetic flux. These low-latitude coronal holes are not well
measured with either the He I 10830 line in previous studies, or EIT EUV

models as a function of the incident wave period and floe thickness. Recent
explorations in the Antarctic Mixed Ice Zone (MIZ) revealed a further
dependence on wave amplitude, suggesting that nonlinear contributions are
non-negligible. An experimental model for wave attenuation by a single ice floe
in a wave flume is here presented. Observations are compared with linear
predictions based on wave scattering. Results indicate that linear models
perform well under the effect of gently sloping waves. For more energetic wave
fields, however, transmitted wave height is normally over predicted. Deviations
from linearity appear to be related to an enhancement of wave dissipation
induced by unaccounted wave-ice interaction processes, including the floe over
wash.

spectroscopic properties of light nuclei near the shell closures. Evidences of
the $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{94}$Mo were shown, motivating the search
for the same structure in other intermediate mass nuclei.
  $Purpose$: The systematic analysis of the $\alpha$-cluster structure in
$^{94}$Mo and four even-even neighbouring nuclei.
  $Method$: The $\alpha$-cluster model with the local potential approach.
  $Results$: A good general description of the experimental ground state bands
is obtained with only one variable parameter. It is shown that the employed
$\alpha+\textrm{core}$ potential is weakly dependent on the angular momentum
$L$ and such dependence may be described satisfactorily by a simple
$L$-dependent factor for the five nuclei. The radial parameter of the
$\alpha+\textrm{core}$ potential reveals a linear trend in relation to the
total nuclear radius and the sum of the $\alpha$-cluster and core radii. The
calculated $B(E2)$ transition rates reproduce correctly the order of magnitude
of almost all experimental data without the use of effective charges. The rms
intercluster separations and reduced $\alpha$-widths obtained for the ground
state bands point to a reduction of the $\alpha$-cluster intensity with the
increasing spin. Negative parity bands are calculated and compared to available
experimental levels. The volume integral per nucleon pair and rms radii were
calculated for the studied $\alpha+\textrm{core}$ potentials, revealing a
similarity with the real parts of the optical potentials used to describe the
$\alpha + ^{90}$Zr and $\alpha + ^{92}$Mo elastic scattering at several
energies.
  $Conclusions$: This work strongly indicates the presence of similar
$\alpha+\textrm{core}$ structures for the $N=52$ even-even nuclei of the Mo
region.

Recently, there has been interest in the universalities that occur in the

early-warning signals have been reported in time series representing systems
near catastrophic shifts. The proper understanding of these early-warnings may

place. Known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events their effects were felt
globally, although the North Atlantic experienced the largest temperature
anomalies. Paleoclimate data shows that the fluctuations often occurred right
after massive glacial meltwater releases in the North Atlantic and in bursts of
three or four with progressively decreasing strengths. In this study a simple
dynamical model of an overturning circulation and sea ice is developed with the
goal of understanding the fundamental mechanisms that could have caused the DO
events. Interaction between sea ice and the overturning circulation in the
model produces self-sustained oscillations. Analysis and numerical experiments
reveal that the insulating effect of sea ice causes the ocean to periodically
vent out accumulated heat in the deep ocean into the atmosphere. Subjecting the
model to idealized freshwater forcing mimicking Heinrich events causes
modulation of the natural periodicity and produces burst patterns very similar
to what is observed in temperature proxy data. Numerical experiments with the

Apart from validating the encouraging performance of SRC-based multimodal

exploiting small random dictionary for sparsity-based score computation, which
consists of training samples from a limited number of randomly selected
subjects. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SRC-based
multimodal verification compared to the state-of-the-art multimodal methods

collaborative filtering techniques for personalized QoS prediction. These
approaches, by leveraging partially observed QoS values from users, can achieve

developing practical Web service recommender systems. In this paper, we make
the first attempt to cope with the privacy concerns for Web service

  Networks with Decode-and-Forward Relays",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This letter studies distributed opportunistic channel access in a wireless
network with decode-and-forward relays. All the sources use channel contention
to get transmission opportunity. If a source wins the contention, the channel
state information in the first-hop channel (from the source to its relay) is
estimated, and a decision is made for the winner source to either give up the
transmission opportunity and let all sources start a new contention, or
transmit to the relay. Once the relay gets the traffic, it may have a sequence
of probings of the second-hop channel (from the relay to the destination).
After each probing, if the second-hop channel is good enough, the relay
transmits to the destination and completes the transmission process of the
source; otherwise, the relay decides either to give up and let all sources
start a new contention, or to continue to probe the second-hop channel. The
optimal decision strategies for the two hops are derived in this letter. The
first-hop strategy is a pure-threshold strategy, i.e., when the first-hop
channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is more than a threshold, the winner source
should transmit to the relay, and subsequently the second-hop strategy should
let the relay keep probing the second-hop channel until a good enough
second-hop channel is observed. Simulation results show that our scheme is
beneficial when the second-hop channels have larger average SNR.

phenotypic equilibrium, which were often explained by different concepts of
stabilities of the models. Here we present a stochastic multi-phenotype
branching model by integrating conventional cellular hierarchy with phenotypic
plasticity mechanisms of cancer cells. Based on our model, it is shown that:
(i) our model can serve as a framework to unify the previous models for the
phenotypic equilibrium, and then harmonizes the different kinds of
average-level stabilities proposed in these models; and (ii) path-wise
convergence of our model provides a deeper understanding to the phenotypic

to a novel form of geometrically induced magnetic catalysis. The dynamical mass
squared is then modified not only due to the chiral gap effect by an amount

issues associated with reinforcement learning, such as the distal reward
problem. Spiking neural networks provide a useful technique in implementing
reinforcement learning in an embodied context as they can deal with continuous
parameter spaces and as such are better at generalizing the correct behaviour
to perform in a given context.
  In this project we implement a version of DA-modulated STDP in an embodied
robot on a food foraging task. Through simulated dopaminergic neurons we show
how the robot is able to learn a sequence of behaviours in order to achieve a
food reward. In tests the robot was able to learn food-attraction behaviour,
and subsequently unlearn this behaviour when the environment changed, in all 50
trials. Moreover we show that the robot is able to operate in an environment
whereby the optimal behaviour changes rapidly and so the agent must constantly
relearn. In a more complex environment, consisting of food-containers, the
robot was able to learn food-container attraction in 95% of trials, despite the
large temporal distance between the correct behaviour and the reward. This is
achieved by shifting the dopamine response from the primary stimulus (food) to
the secondary stimulus (food-container).
  Our work provides insights into the reasons behind some observed biological
phenomena, such as the bursting behaviour observed in dopaminergic neurons. As
well as demonstrating how spiking neural network controlled robots are able to
solve a range of reinforcement learning tasks.

Artin-Shelter regularity. The above concepts are then applied to the
4-dimensional Sklyanin algebras, $A:=A(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. We define an
action of the Klein four-group on $A$ such that the action restricts to a
special geometric factor ring $B$ (a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring). The
cocycle twists of these algebras, denoted by $A^{G,\mu}$ and $B^{G,\mu}$

nearest-neighbor classification, the maximin correlation approach (MCA)
provides the worst-case optimal solution by minimizing the maximum
misclassification risk through an iterative procedure. Despite the optimality,
the original MCA has drawbacks that have limited its wide applicability in
practice. That is, the MCA tends to be sensitive to outliers, cannot
effectively handle nonlinearities in datasets, and suffers from having high
computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose an improved
solution, named regularized maximin correlation approach (R-MCA). We first
reformulate MCA as a quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP)
problem, incorporate regularization by introducing slack variables in the
primal problem of the QCLP, and derive the corresponding Lagrangian dual. The
dual formulation enables us to apply the kernel trick to R-MCA so that it can
better handle nonlinearities. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
regularization and kernelization make the proposed R-MCA more robust and
accurate for various classification tasks than the original MCA. Furthermore,
when the data size or dimensionality grows, R-MCA runs substantially faster by
solving either the primal or dual (whichever has a smaller variable dimension)

  for Non-Visual Tasks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial agents today can answer factual questions. But they fall short on
questions that require common sense reasoning. Perhaps this is because most
existing common sense databases rely on text to learn and represent knowledge.
But much of common sense knowledge is unwritten - partly because it tends not
to be interesting enough to talk about, and partly because some common sense is
unnatural to articulate in text. While unwritten, it is not unseen. In this
paper we leverage semantic common sense knowledge learned from images - i.e.
visual common sense - in two textual tasks: fill-in-the-blank and visual
paraphrasing. We propose to ""imagine"" the scene behind the text, and leverage
visual cues from the ""imagined"" scenes in addition to textual cues while
answering these questions. We imagine the scenes as a visual abstraction. Our
approach outperforms a strong text-only baseline on these tasks. Our proposed
tasks can serve as benchmarks to quantitatively evaluate progress in solving
tasks that go ""beyond recognition"". Our code and datasets are publicly
available.

exchange (RX) qubit in a triple quantum dot. This RX qubit is a variation of
the exchange-only spin qubit which responds to a narrow-band resonant
frequency. Our noise model includes uncorrelated charge noise in each quantum
dot giving rise to two independent (noisy) bias parameters $\varepsilon$ and
$\Delta$. We calculate the energy splitting of the two qubit states as a
function of these two bias detuning parameters to find ""sweet spots"", where the
qubit is least susceptible to noise. Our investigation shows that such sweet
spots exist within the low bias regime, in which the bias detuning parameters
have the same magnitude as the hopping parameters. The location of the sweet
spots in the $(\varepsilon,\Delta)$ plane depends on the hopping strength and
asymmetry between the quantum dots. In the regime of weak charge noise, we
identify a new favorable operating regime for the RX qubit based on these sweet
spots.

(MOO) problem, the search region corresponds to the part of the objective space
containing all the points that are not dominated by any point of $N$, i.e. the
part of the objective space which may contain further nondominated points. In
this paper, we consider a representation of the search region by a set of tight
local upper bounds (in the minimization case) that can be derived from the
points of $N$. Local upper bounds play an important role in methods for
generating or approximating the nondominated set of an MOO problem, yet few
works in the field of MOO address their efficient incremental determination. We
relate this issue to the state of the art in computational geometry and provide
several equivalent definitions of local upper bounds that are meaningful in
MOO. We discuss the complexity of this representation in arbitrary dimension,
which yields an improved upper bound on the number of solver calls in
epsilon-constraint-like methods to generate the nondominated set of a discrete
MOO problem. We analyze and enhance a first incremental approach which operates
by eliminating redundancies among local upper bounds. We also study some
properties of local upper bounds, especially concerning the issue of redundant
local upper bounds, that give rise to a new incremental approach which avoids
such redundancies. Finally, the complexities of the incremental approaches are
compared from the theoretical and empirical points of view.

structures like Loop I and the Fermi bubbles following an iterative procedure
that re-injects filtered LAT counts residual maps into the model. We confirm
that the cosmic-ray proton density varies with the distance from the Galactic

during physical activities is proposed. Methods: It jointly estimates spectra
of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple
measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery. Due to a common sparsity
constraint on spectral coefficients, the method can easily identify and remove
spectral peaks of motion artifact (MA) in PPG spectra. Thus, it does not need
any extra signal processing modular to remove MA as in some other algorithms.
Furthermore, seeking spectral peaks associated with heart rate is simplified.
Results: Experimental results on 12 PPG datasets sampled at 25 Hz and recorded
during subjects' fast running showed that it had high performance. The average
absolute estimation error was 1.28 beat per minute and the standard deviation
was 2.61 beat per minute. Conclusion and Significance: These results show that
the method has great potential to be used for PPG-based heart rate monitoring
in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring.
