basis and nothing was improved since then. Smartphones and tablets give direct
access to screen elements but on a very limited set of commands (scroll and

using recursive partitioning techniques is proposed. We assume an extension of
the Rasch model that allows for DIF being induced by an arbitrary number of

one tree for each item and leads to simultaneous selection of items and
variables that induce DIF. For each item it is possible to detect groups of
subjects with different item difficulties, defined by combinations of
characteristics that are not pre-specified. An algorithm is proposed that is

document length. However, it does not distinguish the verbosity from the scope,
these being the two main factors determining the document length. Because the
verbosity and scope have largely different effects on the increase in term
frequency, the standard approach can easily suffer from insufficient or
excessive penalization depending on the specific type of long document. To
overcome these problems, this paper proposes two-stage normalization by
performing verbosity and scope normalization separately, and by employing
different penalization functions. In verbosity normalization, each document is
pre-normalized by dividing the term frequency by the verbosity of the document.
In scope normalization, an existing retrieval model is applied in a
straightforward manner to the pre-normalized document, finally leading us to
formulate our proposed verbosity normalized (VN) retrieval model. Experimental
results carried out on standard TREC collections demonstrate that the VN model
leads to marginal but statistically significant improvements over standard
retrieval models.

$x$ is essential for the function $f$ with respect to $C$ if there exists a

known that any threshold function has a unique minimal teaching set, which
coincides with the set of its essential points. In this paper we study teaching
sets of $k$-threshold functions, i.e. functions that can be represented as a
conjunction of $k$ threshold functions. We reveal a connection between
essential points of $k$ threshold functions and essential points of the
corresponding $k$-threshold function. We note that, in general, a $k$-threshold
function is not specified by its essential points and can have more than one

from this class can be defined by a $k$-threshold function for some $k$. In
terms of $k$-threshold functions we prove that a polytope with vertices in the

set of its essential points. For $d=2$ we describe structure of the minimal
teaching set of a polytope and show that cardinality of this set is either
$\Theta(n^2)$ or $O(n)$ and depends on the perimeter and the minimum angle of

the major levels of nuclei are calculated by employing a Hartree-Fock
inspired-scheme in the spherical harmonic oscillator basis. In the scheme, the
correlation influences are taken into account by imposing the nucleon effective
mass factor on the radial wave functions of the major levels. Replacing the
density-dependent one-body momentum distribution functions of nucleons,
n(k,rho), with the Heaviside functions, the role of n(k,rho) on the nucleon

The best fit of spin-orbit splitting is taken into account when correcting the
major levels of the nuclei by using the parameterized Wood-Saxon potential and
the AV18 density-dependent mean field potential which is constructed by the
LOCV method. Considering the point-like protons in the spherical Coulomb's

documents enhances representation, importance, relevancy, provenience, and
priority of the document. These attributes are the core elements that form the
machine-based knowledge representation for documents. However, modeling
document relationships that can change over time can be inelegant, limited,
complex or overly burdensome for semantic technologies. In this paper, we
present Direct Qualification (DQ), an approach for modeling any semantically
referenced document, concept, or named graph with results from associated
applied analytics. The proposed approach supplements the traditional
subject-object relationships by providing a third leg to the relationship; the
qualification of how and why the relationship exists. To illustrate, we show a
prototype of an event-based system with a realistic use case for applying DQ to
relevancy analytics of PageRank and Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS).

  Predojevic and M. W. Mitchell",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Together with photon emission, the absorption of a single photon by a single
atom is a fundamental process in matter-light interaction that manifests its
quantum mechanical nature. As an experimentally controlled process, it is a key
tool for the realization of quantum technologies. In particular, in an
atom/photon based quantum network scenario, in which localized atomic particles
are used as quantum information processing nodes while photons are used as
carriers of quantum information between distant nodes, controlling both
emission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is required for
quantum coherent state mapping between the two entities. Most experimental
efforts to date have focused on establishing the control of single photon
emission by single trapped atoms, and the implementation of quantum networking
protocols using this interaction. In this chapter, we describe experimental
efforts to control the process of single photon absorption by single trapped
ions. We describe a series of experiments in which polarization entangled
photon pairs, generated by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, are
coupled to a single ion. First the source is operated to generate heralded
single photons, and coincidences between the absorption event of one photon of
the pair and the detection of the heralding partner photon are observed. We
then show how polarization control in the process is established, leading to
the manifestation of the photonic polarization entanglement in the absorption
process. Finally, we introduce protocols in which this interaction scheme is
harnessed to perform tasks in a quantum network, such as entanglement
distribution among distant nodes of the network, and we demonstrate a specific
protocol for heralded, high-fidelity photon-to-atom quantum state transfer.

media pundits and computational social choice theorists. Since it is often
infeasible to elicit the preferences of all the voters in a typical prediction
scenario, a common algorithm used for winner prediction is to run the election
on a small sample of randomly chosen votes and output the winner as the
prediction. We analyze the performance of this algorithm for many common voting
rules.
  More formally, we introduce the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-winner determination
problem, where given an election on $n$ voters and $m$ candidates in which the
margin of victory is at least $\epsilon n$ votes, the goal is to determine the
winner with probability at least $1-\delta$. The margin of victory of an
election is the smallest number of votes that need to be modified in order to
change the election winner. We show interesting lower and upper bounds on the
number of samples needed to solve the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-winner determination
problem for many common voting rules, including scoring rules, approval,
maximin, Copeland, Bucklin, plurality with runoff, and single transferable
vote. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds match for many common voting rules
in a wide range of practically appealing scenarios.

Matubayasi and Nakahara provides with an approximate way of calculating
solvation free energies (or, identically, the excess chemical potentials) from
atomistic simulations. In this document we provide some derivation details of
this, to our opinion, theoretically involved method, which will help a
non-specialist to follow. There are three points which differ this document
from a regular textbook on statistical mechanics or research articles:
  1) Derivation is detailed and all approximations are explicitly stated;
  2) Statistical mechanics derivations are performed in NPT-ensemble;
  3) We perform the derivations for the case when a molecule is represented as
a set of (atomic) sites interacting via spherically symmetric potentials (a
classical Force Field representation).
  In ER method, a new collective coordinate is introduced - the interaction
energy of a solute and a solvent molecule. The excess chemical potential is
expressed as a functional of the solute-solvent density distribution defined
over the collective variable. The functional can be approximated by the
Percus's method of functional expansion, which leads to the end-point (not
dependent on the $\lambda$-coupling path) free energy expression.
  As a side result, we prove that the solvation free energy is always
equivalent to the excess (over ideal) chemical potential, and not only at
infinite dilution or when internal molecule degrees of freedom are not affected
by solvation as it is sometimes wrongly believed.

literature data, on the Gould's Belt close binary systems GG Lup and $\mu^1$
Sco are presented and analysed.
  In the case of GG Lup, light and radial velocity curve fittings confirm a
near-Main-Sequence picture of a pair of close stars. Absolute parameters are
found, to within a few percent, thus: $M_1$ = 4.16$\pm$0.12, $M_2$ =
2.64$\pm$0.12, $R_{1}$ = 2.42$\pm$0.05, $R_2$ = 1.79$\pm$0.04, ($\odot$);
$T_{1}$ $\sim$13000, $T_2$ $\sim$10600 (K); photometric distance $\sim$ 160
(pc). The high eccentricity and relatively short period (105 y) of apsidal
revolution may be related to an apparent `slow B-type pulsator' (SPB)
oscillation. Disturbances of the outer envelope of at least one of the
components then compromise comparisons to standard evolutionary models, at
least regarding the age of the system. A rate of apsidal advance is derived,
which allows a check on the mean internal structure constant $\bar{k_2} =
0.0058 \pm 0.0004$. This is in agreement with values recently derived for young
stars of solar composition and mass $\sim$3${\odot}$.
  For $\mu^1$ Sco, we agree with previous authors that the secondary component
is considerably oversized for its mass, implying binary (interactive) stellar
evolution, probably of the `Case A' type. The primary appears relatively little
affected by this evolution, however. Its parameters show consistency with a
star of its derived mass at age about 13 My, consistent with the star's
membership of the Sco-Cen OB2 Association. The absolute parameters are as
follows: $M_1$ = 8.3$\pm$1.0, $M_2$ = 4.6$\pm$1.0, $R_{1}$ = 3.9$\pm$0.3, $R_2$
= 4.6$\pm$0.4, ($\odot$); $T_{1}$ $\sim$24000, $T_2$ $\sim$17000 (K);

of compact binary coalescence using gravitational-wave data and waveform
models. Using a spherical harmonic mode decomposition, the waveform is
expressed as a sum over modes that depend on the intrinsic parameters (e.g.
masses) with coefficients that depend on the observer dependent extrinsic
parameters (e.g. distance, sky position). The data is then prefiltered against
those modes, at fixed intrinsic parameters, enabling efficiently evaluation of
the likelihood for generic source positions and orientations, independent of
waveform length or generation time. We efficiently parallelize our intrinsic
space calculation by integrating over all extrinsic parameters using a Monte
Carlo integration strategy. Since the waveform generation and prefiltering
happens only once, the cost of integration dominates the procedure. Also, we
operate hierarchically, using information from existing gravitational-wave
searches to identify the regions of parameter space to emphasize in our
sampling. As proof of concept and verification of the result, we have
implemented this algorithm using standard time-domain waveforms, processing
each event in less than one hour on recent computing hardware. For most events
we evaluate the marginalized likelihood (evidence) with statistical errors of
less than about 5%, and even smaller in many cases. With a bounded runtime
independent of the waveform model starting frequency, a nearly-unchanged
strategy could estimate NS-NS parameters in the 2018 advanced LIGO era. Our
algorithm is usable with any noise curve and existing time-domain model at any
mass, including some waveforms which are computationally costly to evolve.

  deformation on air-mucus interaction",,,,,"physics.med-ph physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chest physiotherapy is an empirical technique used to help secretions to get
out of the lung whenever stagnation occurs. Although commonly used, little is
known about the inner mechanisms of chest physiotherapy and controversies about
its use are coming out regularly. Thus, a scientific validation of chest
physiotherapy is needed to evaluate its effects on secretions.
  We setup a quasi-static numerical model of chest physiotherapy based on
thorax and lung physiology and on their respective biophysics. We modeled the
lung with an idealized deformable symmetric bifurcating tree. Bronchi and their
inner fluids mechanics are assumed axisymmetric. Static data from the
literature is used to build a model for the lung's mechanics. Secretions motion
is the consequence of the shear constraints apply by the air flow. The input of
the model is the pressure on the chest wall at each time, and the output is the
bronchi geometry and air and secretions properties.
  In the limit of our model, we mimicked manual and mechanical chest
physiotherapy techniques. We show that for secretions to move, air flow has to
be high enough to overcome secretion resistance to motion. Moreover, the higher
the pressure or the quicker it is applied, the higher is the air flow and thus
the mobilization of secretions. However, pressures too high are efficient up to
a point where airways compressions prevents air flow to increases any further.
Generally, the first effects of manipulations is a decrease of the airway tree
hydrodynamic resistance, thus improving ventilation even if secretions do not
get out of the lungs. Also, some secretions might be pushed deeper into the
lungs; this effect is stronger for high pressures and for mechanical chest
physiotherapy. Finally, we propose and tested two adimensional numbers that
depend on lung properties and that allow to measure the efficiency and comfort
of a manipulation.

particular, we are able to show that simple symmetry considerations determine,
to a large extent, how their properties depend functionally on some of the

formalism to find the functional dependence of the expectation value of the
momentum of a Bose-Einstein condensate, described by the Gross-Pitaewskii
equation, when it is exposed to a sawtooth potential whose amplitude is
periodically modulated in time. We show that, by using this formalism, a small

parameters. This can be very helpful when characterizing experimentally the
response of systems for which performing measurements is costly or difficult.

as modularity, is optimized over all partitions of the graph compared against a
null random graph model. Here we introduce a systematic dynamical framework to
design and analyze a wide variety of quality functions for community detection.
The quality of a partition is measured by its Markov Stability, a
time-parametrized function defined in terms of the statistical properties of a
Markov process taking place on the graph. The Markov process provides a
dynamical sweeping across all scales in the graph, and the time scale is an
intrinsic parameter that uncovers communities at different resolutions.
  This dynamic-based community detection leads to a compound optimization,
which favours communities of comparable centrality (as defined by the
stationary distribution), and provides a unifying framework for spectral
algorithms, as well as different heuristics for community detection, including
versions of modularity and Potts model. Our dynamic framework creates a
systematic link between different stochastic dynamics and their corresponding
notions of optimal communities under distinct (node and edge) centralities. We
show that the Markov Stability can be computed efficiently to find multi-scale
community structure in large networks.

$x\leftrightarrow y$ denotes the event that $x$ and $y$ are in the same open

algorithm for solving optimization problems involving a strongly convex
objective function that is separable into $n \geq 2$ blocks, subject to
(non-separable) linear equality constraints. The F-ADMM algorithm uses a
Gauss-Seidel scheme to update blocks of variables, and a regularization term is
added to each of the subproblems arising within F-ADMM. We prove, under common
assumptions, that F-ADMM is globally convergent.
  We also present a special case of F-ADMM that is partially parallelizable,
which makes it attractive in a big data setting. In particular, we partition
the data into groups, so that each group consists of multiple blocks of
variables. By applying F-ADMM to this partitioning of the data, and using a
specific regularization matrix, we obtain a hybrid ADMM (H-ADMM) algorithm: the
grouped data is updated in a Gauss-Seidel fashion, and the blocks within each
group are updated in a Jacobi manner. Convergence of H-ADMM follows directly
from the convergence properties of F-ADMM. Also, a special case of H-ADMM can
be applied to functions that are convex, rather than strongly convex. We
present numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical advantages of this
algorithm.

allows to transfer the mathematical methods, developed previously for unrooted

the generic functional for all r-particle distributions. From this we derive
the examples of 2- and 3-particle correlations up to four intersection centers

templates, we calculate fitting factors and systematic biases, and compare the
biases with the {\it true} statistical uncertainties. We find that the valid
criteria of the bank of $Imerg$ templates are obtained as $Mcrit \sim 24 Msun$

$Mcrit \sim 26 Msun$ for parameter estimation (if $M>Mcrit$, the systematic
bias is larger than the {\it true} statistical uncertainty where the signal to

corona revealed first by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board
\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}. Eruption of HC is often associated with
flare and coronal mass ejection. Previous studies suggest that HC is a good
proxy of magnetic flux rope (MFR) in the inner corona, in addition to another
well-known MFR candidate, the prominence-cavity structure that is with a normal
coronal temperature ($\sim$1-2 MK). In this paper, we report a high temperature
structure (HTS, $\sim$1.5 MK) contained in an interplanetary coronal mass
ejection induced by an HC eruption. According to the observations of
bidirectional electrons, high temperature and density, strong magnetic field,
and its association with the shock, sheath, and plasma pile-up region, we
suggest that the HTS is the interplanetary counterpart of the HC. The scale of
the measured HTS is around 14 R$_\odot$, and it maintained a much higher
temperature than the background solar wind even at 1 AU. It is significantly
different from the typical magnetic clouds (MCs), which usually have a much
lower temperature. Our study suggests that the existence of a corotating
interaction region ahead of the HC formed a magnetic container to inhibit the
HC expansion and cooling down to a low temperature.

understanding the evolution of the core, atmosphere and life on Earth. A record
of the early geodynamo is preserved in ancient silicate crystals containing
minute magnetic inclusions. These data indicate the presence of a geodynamo
during the Paleoarchean, between 3.4 and 3.45 billion years ago. While the
magnetic field sheltered Earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoff
of the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modern
extreme solar storms. These conditions suggest that intense radiation from the
young Sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young Earth by promoting loss
of volatiles, including water. Such effects would have been more pronounced if
the field were absent or very weak prior to 3.45 billion years ago, as
suggested by some models of lower mantle evolution. The frontier is thus trying
to obtain geomagnetic field records that are >>3.45 billion-years-old, as well
as constraining solar wind pressure for these times. In this review we suggest
pathways for constraining these parameters and the attendant history of Earth's
deep interior, hydrosphere and atmosphere. In particular, we discuss new
estimates for solar wind pressure for the first 700 million years of Earth
history, the competing effects of magnetic shielding versus solar ion
collection, and bounds on the detection level of a geodynamo imposed by the
presence of external fields. We also discuss the prospects for constraining

attention to the substance of students' ideas, is typically characterized along
two dimensions: the level of detail at which teachers attend and respond to

evaluating for correctness vs. interpreting meaning. We propose that
characterizations of progress in responsive teaching should also consider the
disciplinary centrality of the practices teachers notice and respond to within
student thinking. To illustrate what this kind of progress can look like, we
present a case study of a middle school science teacher who implemented the
""same"" lesson on the motion of freely falling objects in two subsequent years.
We argue that his primary shift in responsiveness stemmed from a shift in which
disciplinary practices he preferentially noticed and foregrounded. He moved
from a focus on causal factors or variables to a more scientifically productive
focus on causal stories or explanations. We explore how participation in a
professional development community, institutional constraints, and a shift in
personal epistemology may have contributed to the nature and stability of this
shift in responsiveness.

find that a quadratic approximation is enough to capture the computational
power of ESN with tanh function. The results of this study apply to both

system. It is known that an on-axis spherical/parabolic optical component,
placed at an angle to the incident beam introduces defocus as well as
astigmatism in the image plane. Although the former can be compensated by
changing the focal plane position, the latter cannot be removed by mere optical
re-alignment. Since the DM is to be used to compensate a turbulence-induced
curvature term in addition to other aberrations, it is necessary to determine
the aberrations induced by such (curved DM surface) an optical element when
placed at an angle (other than 0 degree) of incidence in the optical path. To
this effect, we estimate to a first order, the aberrations introduced by a DM
as a function of the incidence angle and deformation of the DM surface. We
record images using a simple setup in which the incident beam is reflected by a
37 channel Micro-machined Membrane Deformable Mirror for various angles of
incidence. It is observed that astigmatism is a dominant aberration which was
determined by measuring the difference between the tangential and sagital focal
planes. We justify our results on the basis of theoretical simulations and
discuss the feasibility of using such a system for adaptive optics considering
a trade-off between wavefront correction and astigmatism due to deformation.

there arises either vibration of the interface or increment in the velocity of

structure of distributions attaining a secret key rate of $I(X:Y|Z)$. In
obtaining our results, we completely solve the problem of secret key
distillation under scenario (i) and identify $H(S|Z)$ to be the optimal key
rate using shared randomness, where $S$ is the G\'acs-K\""orner Common

switch between transparent and opaque states for both the two polarization
states with a maximized MD of tens of decibels. This modulator is compatible
with current fiber-optic communication systems and may be applied in the near

on the extreme horizontal branch. Their formation history is still puzzling as
the sdB progenitors must lose nearly all of their hydrogen envelope during the
red-giant phase. About half of the known sdBs are in close binaries with
periods from 1.2 h to a few days, a fact that implies they experienced a
common-envelope phase. Eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries (also called HW Virginis
systems) are rare but important objects for determining fundamental stellar
parameters. Even more significant and uncommon are those binaries containing a
pulsating sdB, as the mass can be determined independently by asteroseismology.
  Here we present a first analysis of the eclipsing hot subdwarf binary
V2008-1753. The light curve shows a total eclipse, a prominent reflection
effect, and low--amplitude pulsations with periods from 150 to 180 s. An
analysis of the light-- and radial velocity (RV) curves indicates a mass ratio
close to $ q = 0.146$, an RV semi-amplitude of $K=54.6 \,\rm kms^{-1}$, and an
inclination of $i=86.8^\circ$. Combining these results with our spectroscopic
determination of the surface gravity, $\log \,g = 5.83$, the best--fitting
model yields an sdB mass of 0.47$M_{\rm \odot}$ and a companion mass of $69
M_{\rm Jup}$. As the latter mass is below the hydrogen-burning limit,
V2008-1753 represents the first HW Vir system known consisting of a pulsating
sdB and a brown dwarf companion. Consequently, it holds great potential for
better constraining models of sdB binary evolution and asteroseismology.

at late times $t$ the survival probability of an unstable state cannot have the
form of an exponentially decreasing function of time $t$ but it has an inverse
power-like form. This is a general property of unstable states following from
basic principles of quantum theory. The consequence of this property is that in
the case of false vacuum states the cosmological constant becomes dependent on
time: $\Lambda - \Lambda_{\text{bare}}\equiv \Lambda(t) -\Lambda_{\text{bare}}
\sim 1/t^{2}$. We construct the cosmological model with decaying vacuum energy
density and matter for solving the cosmological constant problem and the
coincidence problem. We show the equivalence of the proposed decaying false
vacuum cosmology with the $\Lambda(t)$ cosmologies (the $\Lambda(t)$CDM
models). The cosmological implications of the model of decaying vacuum energy
(dark energy) are discussed. We constrain the parameters of the model with
decaying vacuum using astronomical data. For this aim we use the observation of
distant supernovae of type Ia, measurements of $H(z)$, BAO, CMB and others. The
model analyzed is in good agreement with observation data and explain a small
value of the cosmological constant today.

the Conditional Autoregressive Value--at--Risk (CAViaR) models of Eengle and
Manganelli (2004) are compared to those obtained by the popular Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models of Engle (1982) and to the
recently introduced Generalised Autoregressive Score (GAS) models of Creal et

tests which permits to construct a set of ""superior"" models, where the null
hypothesis of Equal Predictive Ability (EPA) is not rejected at a certain
confidence level. Our empirical results, suggest that, after the Global
Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2008, highly non-linear volatility models
deliver better VaR forecasts for the European countries as opposed to other

dominated by a dense, flowing QCD medium. Opposing interpretations seem to be
supported by alternative data models, and current model-comparison schemes are
unable to distinguish between them. There is clearly need for a convincing new
methodology to break the deadlock. In this study we introduce Bayesian
Inference (BI) methods applied to angular correlation data as a basis to
evaluate competing data models. For simplicity the data considered are
projections of 2D angular correlations onto 1D azimuth from three centrality
classes of 200 GeV AuAu collisions. We consider several data models typical of
current model choices, including Fourier series (FS) and a Gaussian plus
various combinations of individual cosine components. We evaluate model
performance with BI methods and with power-spectrum (PS) analysis. We find that
the FS-only model is rejected in all cases by Bayesian analysis which always
prefers a Gaussian. A cylindrical quadrupole cos(2\phi) is required in some
cases but rejected for 0-5%-central AuAu collisions. Given a Gaussian centered
at the azimuth origin ""higher harmonics"" cos(m\phi) for m > 2 are rejected. A
model consisting of Gaussian + dipole cos(\phi) + quadrupole cos(2\phi)
provides good 1D data descriptions in all cases.

determine whether a transfer of angular momentum from disk to jet can be
observed. Many recent studies report on the rotation of T Tauri disks, and on
what may be a signature of T Tauri jet rotation. However, due to observational
difficulties, few studies report on both disk and jet within the same system to
establish if the senses of rotation match and hence can be interpreted as a
transfer of angular momentum. We report a clear signature of Keplerian rotation
in the RY Tau disk, based on Plateau de Bure observations. We also report on
the transverse radial velocity profile of the RY Tau jet close to the star. We
identify two distinct profile shapes: a v-shape which appears near jet shock
positions, and a flat profile which appears between shocks. We do not detect a
rotation signature above 3 sigma uncertainty in any of our transverse cuts of
the jet. Nevertheless, if the jet is currently in steady-state, the errors
themselves provide a valuable upper limit on the jet toroidal velocity of 10
km/s, implying a launch radius of < 0.45 AU. However, possible contamination of
jet kinematics, via shocks or precession, prevents any firm constraint on the
jet launch point, since most of its angular momentum could be stored in
magnetic form rather than in rotation of matter.

pathways to communicate by selecting characters in a matrix containing all the
alphabet symbols. Although this technology has made considerable progress in
the last years, it still suffers from both low communication rate and high
error rate. This article presents a P300 speller, named PolyMorph, that

that reduces the size of the selection matrix itself by removing useless
symbols, and sentence-based predictions, that exploit all the spelt characters
of a sentence to determine the probability of a word. In order to measure the
effectiveness of the presented speller, we describe two sets of tests: the
first one in vivo and the second one in silico. The results of these

In previous work, we developed a quasi-Gaussian approximation for
the likelihood of correlation functions, which, in contrast to the usual
Gaussian approach, incorporates fundamental mathematical constraints on
correlation functions. The analytical computation of these constraints is only
feasible in the case of correlation functions of one-dimensional random fields.
  Aims. In this work, we aim to obtain corresponding constraints in the case of
higher-dimensional random fields and test them in a more realistic context.
  Methods. We develop numerical methods to compute the constraints on
correlation functions which are also applicable for two- and three-dimensional
fields. In order to test the accuracy of the numerically obtained constraints,
we compare them to the analytical results for the one-dimensional case.
Finally, we compute correlation functions from the halo catalog of the
Millennium Simulation, check whether they obey the constraints, and examine the
performance of the transformation used in the construction of the
quasi-Gaussian likelihood.
  Results. We find that our numerical methods of computing the constraints are
robust and that the correlation functions measured from the Millennium

lie well inside the allowed region of parameter space, i.e. far away from the

indications that the quasi-Gaussian likelihood yields a substantially more

Factor Graphs in Reduced Normal Form (FGrn) applied to a two-dimensional
lattice. The Latent Variable Model (LVM) is the basic building block of a
quadtree hierarchy built on top of a bottom layer of random variables that
represent pixels of an image, a feature map, or more generally a collection of
spatially distributed discrete variables. The multi-layer architecture
implements a hierarchical data representation that, via belief propagation, can
be used for learning and inference. Typical uses are pattern completion,
correction and classification. The FGrn paradigm provides great flexibility and
modularity and appears as a promising candidate for building deep networks: the
system can be easily extended by introducing new and different (in cardinality
and in type) variables. Prior knowledge, or supervised information, can be
introduced at different scales. The FGrn paradigm provides a handy way for
building all kinds of architectures by interconnecting only three types of
units: Single Input Single Output (SISO) blocks, Sources and Replicators. The
network is designed like a circuit diagram and the belief messages flow
bidirectionally in the whole system. The learning algorithms operate only
locally within each block. The framework is demonstrated in this paper in a
three-layer structure applied to images extracted from a standard data set.

presented for subsonic and supersonic viscous flow simulation on complex
geometries. Under the Cartesian mesh, the computational grid points are
classified into four different categories, the fluid point, the solid point,
the drop point, and the interpolation point. The boundaries are represented by
a set of direction-oriented boundary points. A constrained weighted least
square method is employed to evaluate the physical quantities at the
interpolation points. Different boundary conditions, including isothermal
boundary, adiabatic boundary, and Euler slip boundary, are presented by
different interpolation strategies. We also propose a simplified gas kinetic
scheme as the flux solver for both subsonic and supersonic flow computations.
The methodology of constructing a simplified kinetic flux function can be
extended to other flow systems. A few numerical examples are used to validate
the Cartesian grid method and the simplified flux function. The reconstruction
scheme for recovering the boundary conditions of compressible viscous and heat
conducting flow with a Cartesian mesh can provide a smooth distribution of
physical quantities at solid boundary, and present an accurate solution for the

  Object Stores",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud services have turned remote computation into a commodity and enable
convenient online collaboration. However, they require that clients fully trust
the service provider in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Towards reducing this dependency, this paper introduces a protocol for
verification of integrity and consistency for cloud object storage (VICOS),
which enables a group of mutually trusting clients to detect data-integrity and
consistency violations for a cloud object-storage service. It aims at services
where multiple clients cooperate on data stored remotely on a potentially
misbehaving service. VICOS enforces the consistency notion of
fork-linearizability, supports wait-free client semantics for most operations,
and reduces the computation and communication overhead compared to previous
protocols. VICOS is based in a generic way on any authenticated data structure.
Moreover, its operations cover the hierarchical name space of a cloud object
store, supporting a real-world interface and not only a simplistic abstraction.
A prototype of VICOS that works with the key-value store interface of commodity
cloud storage services has been implemented, and an evaluation demonstrates its
advantage compared to existing systems.

most known image enhancement method is the histogram equalization. This method
is an automated one, and realizes a simultaneous modification for brightness

saturation and hue in the case of color images. Simple and efficient methods
can be obtained if affine transforms within logarithmic models are used. A very
important thing in the affine transform determination for color images is the
coordinate system that is used for color space representation. Thus, the using
of the RGB coordinates leads to a simultaneous modification of luminosity and
saturation. In this paper using the lrgb perceptual coordinates one can define
affine transforms, which allow a separated modification of luminosity l and
saturation s (saturation being calculated with the component rgb in the
chromatic plane). Better results can be obtained if partitions are defined on
the image support and then the pixels are separately processed in each window
belonging to the defined partition. Classical partitions frequently lead to the
appearance of some discontinuities at the boundaries between these windows. In
order to avoid all these drawbacks the classical partitions may be replaced by
fuzzy partitions. Their elements will be fuzzy windows and in each of them
there will be defined an affine transform induced by parameters using the fuzzy
mean, fuzzy variance and fuzzy saturation computed for the pixels that belong
to the analyzed window. The final image is obtained by summing up in a weight
way the images of every fuzzy window.

this extended emission is dust heated by star formation. We also report
arcsecond resolution MIR and far-IR imaging of the interacting system Arp 245,
taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory.
Using these data, we obtain nuclear fluxes using different methods and find
that we can only recover the nuclear fluxes obtained from the subarcsecond data
at 20-25 micron, where the AGN emission dominates. We fitted the nuclear IR
spectral energy distribution of NGC 2992, including the GTC/CanariCam nuclear
spectrum (~50 pc), with clumpy torus models. We then used the best-fitting
torus model to decompose the Spitzer/IRS 5-30 spectrum (~630 pc) in AGN and
starburst components, using different starburst templates. We find that,
whereas at shorter mid-IR wavelengths the starburst component dominates (64% at

masses, temperatures and star formation rates for the different components of

mechanism by considering dipolar quantum gases of ground state polar molecules

robustness is closely connected to network entropy which, in turn, is very
closely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of
alternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the
classical Riemannian definition, each having its own advantages and

after execution of a large order by accelerating the arrival of the refilling
order, which is defined as a Cox process whose intensity increases by the
degree of the market impact. We include not only the market order but also the
limit order in our strategy in a restricted fashion. We formulate the problem
as a combined stochastic control problem over a finite time horizon. The
corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality is solved
numerically. The optimal strategy obtained consists of three components: (i)
the initial large trade; (ii) the unscheduled small trades during the period;
(iii) the terminal large trade. The size and timing of the trade is governed by
the tolerance for market impact depending on the state at each time step, and
hence the strategy behaves dynamically. We also provide competitive results due
to inclusion of the limit order, even though a limit order is allowed under
conservative evaluation of the execution price.

Glauber-Sudarshan $P$ function is not a classical probability density, which
implies that only coherent states and their statistical mixtures are classical.
We quantify the nonclassicality of a single qubit, defined by the vacuum and
single-photon states, by applying the following four well-known measures of
nonclassicality: (1) the nonclassical depth, $\tau$, related to the minimal
amount of Gaussian noise which changes a nonpositive $P$ function into a
positive one; (2) the nonclassical distance $D$, defined as the Bures distance
of a given state to the closest classical state, which is the vacuum for the
single-qubit Hilbert space; together with (3) the negativity potential (NP) and
(4) concurrence potential, which are the nonclassicality measures corresponding
to the entanglement measures (i.e., the negativity and concurrence,
respectively) for the state generated by mixing a single-qubit state with the
vacuum on a balanced beam splitter. We show that complete statistical mixtures
of the vacuum and single-photon states are the most nonclassical single-qubit
states regarding the distance $D$ for a fixed value of both the depth $\tau$
and NP in the whole range $[0,1]$ of their values, as well as the NP for a
given value of $\tau$ such that $\tau>0.3154$. Conversely, pure states are the
most nonclassical single-qubit states with respect to $\tau$ for a given $D$,
NP versus $D$, and $\tau$ versus NP. We also show the ""relativity"" of these
nonclassicality measures by comparing pairs of single-qubit states: if a state
is less nonclassical than another state according to some measure then it might
be more nonclassical according to another measure. Moreover, we find that the
concurrence potential is equal to the nonclassical distance for single-qubit
states.

Either in the limit of high energy or at vanishing background temperature such

stochastic nature. This stochastic force is actually described by the well
known energy loss rate due to Coulomb collision with ambient particles, but, in
order to match the collision kernel in the linearized Boltzmann equation it
needs to be treated in a very specific manner. In the second part of the paper

the notion of single, double and mixed occupancy representation with
intertwiners relating them a natural physical interpretation of embedded qubits
is found. As an application of these ideas one can make a physically sound
meaning of some of the direct sum structures showing up in the context of the
so-called Black-Hole/Qubit Correspondence. We discuss how the usual invariants
for qubits serving as measures of entanglement can be obtained from invariants
for spinors in an elegant manner. In particular a detailed case study for
recovering the invariants for four-qubits within a spinorial framework is
presented. We also observe that reality conditions on complex spinors defining
Majorana spinors for embedded qubits boil down to self conjugate states under
the Wootters spin flip operation. Finally we conduct a study on the explicit
structure of $Spin(16,\mathbb{C})$ invariant polynomials related to the
structure of possible measures of entanglement for fermionic systems with 8
modes. Here we find an algebraically independent generating set of the
generalized SLOCC invariants and calculate their restriction to the dense
orbit. We point out the special role the largest exceptional group $E_8$ is
playing in these considerations.

amounts of input signals in an efficient manner, which is useful for many
applications. CS reconstructs the compressed signals exactly with overwhelming
probability when incoming data can be sparsely represented with a few
components. However, the theory of CS framework including random sampling has
been focused on exact recovery of signal; impreciseness in signal recovery has
been neglected. This can be problematic when there is uncertainty in the number
of sparse components such as signal sparsity in dynamic systems that can change
over time. We present a new theoretical framework that handles uncertainty in
signal recovery from the perspective of recovery success and quality. We show
that the signal recovery success in our model is more accurate than the success
probability analysis in the CS framework. Our model is then extended to the
case where the success or failure of signal recovery can be relaxed. We
represent the number of components included in signal recovery with a
right-tailed distribution and focus on recovery quality. Experimental results
confirm the accuracy of our model in dynamic systems.

suitably selected wireless devices reuse the cellular spectrum to establish
direct communication links, provided that the adverse effects of D2D
communication on cellular users is minimized and cellular users are given a
higher priority in using limited wireless resources. Despite its great
potential in terms of coverage and capacity performance, implementing this new
concept poses some challenges, in particular with respect to radio resource
management. The main challenges arise from a strong need for distributed D2D
solutions that operate in the absence of precise channel and network knowledge.
In order to address this challenge, this paper studies a resource allocation
problem in a single-cell wireless network with multiple D2D users sharing the
available radio frequency channels with cellular users. We consider a realistic
scenario where the base station (BS) is provided with strictly limited channel
knowledge while D2D and cellular users have no information. We prove a
lower-bound for the cellular aggregate utility in the downlink with fixed BS
power, which allows for decoupling the channel allocation and D2D power control
problems. An efficient graph-theoretical approach is proposed to perform the
channel allocation, which offers flexibility with respect to allocation
criterion (aggregate utility maximization, fairness, quality of service
guarantee). We model the power control problem as a multi-agent learning game.
We show that the game is an exact potential game with noisy rewards, defined on
a discrete strategy set, and characterize the set of Nash equilibria.
Q-learning better-reply dynamics is then used to achieve equilibrium.

the assumption that $f$ and the $g_{i}$'s can be sparsely represented with
respect to two different dictionaries $A_{f}$ and $A_{g}$. This generalizes the
well-known ""morphological component analysis"" to a multi-measurement setting.
The main result of the paper states that $f$ and the $g_{i}$'s can be uniquely
and stably reconstructed by finding sparse representations of $h_{i}$ for every
$i$ with respect to the concatenated dictionary $[A_{f},A_{g}]$, provided that
enough incoherent measurements $g_{i}$ are available. The incoherence is
measured in terms of their mutual disjoint sparsity.
  This method finds applications in the reconstruction procedures of several
hybrid imaging inverse problems, where internal data are measured. These
measurements usually consist of the main unknown multiplied by other unknown
quantities, and so the disjoint sparsity approach can be directly applied. As
an example, we show how to apply the method to the reconstruction in
quantitative photoacoustic tomography, also in the case when the Gr\""uneisen

quantum walk using the phase flip coin, adding a self-loop to each vertex
boosts the success probability from 1/2 to 1. Additional self-loops, however,
decrease the success probability. Using instead the Ambainis, Kempe, and Rivosh

differ in that the first is faster than classical when $l$ scales less than
$N$, while the second requires that $l$ scale less than $N^2$. Finally,
continuous-time quantum walks differ from both of these discrete-time

each other. But for other images, descriptions across people vary considerably.
In other words, some images are specific $-$ they elicit consistent
descriptions from different people $-$ while other images are ambiguous.
Applications involving images and text can benefit from an understanding of
which images are specific and which ones are ambiguous. For instance, consider
text-based image retrieval. If a query description is moderately similar to the
caption (or reference description) of an ambiguous image, that query may be
considered a decent match to the image. But if the image is very specific, a
moderate similarity between the query and the reference description may not be
sufficient to retrieve the image.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of image specificity. We present two
mechanisms to measure specificity given multiple descriptions of an image: an
automated measure and a measure that relies on human judgement. We analyze
image specificity with respect to image content and properties to better
understand what makes an image specific. We then train models to automatically
predict the specificity of an image from image features alone without requiring
textual descriptions of the image. Finally, we show that modeling image
specificity leads to improvements in a text-based image retrieval application.

that wetting failures caused by air entrainment can be suppressed by reducing
the ambient gas pressure. Here, it is shown that non-equilibrium effects in the
gas can account for this behaviour, with ambient pressure reductions increasing
the gas' mean free path and hence the Knudsen number $Kn$. These effects first
manifest themselves through Maxwell slip at the gas' boundaries so that for
sufficiently small $Kn$ they can be incorporated into a continuum model for
dynamic wetting flows. The resulting mathematical model contains flow
structures on the nano-, micro- and milli-metre scales and is implemented into
a computational platform developed specifically for such multiscale phenomena.
The coating flow geometry is used to show that for a fixed gas-liquid-solid
system (a) the increased Maxwell slip at reduced pressures can substantially
delay air entrainment, i.e. increase the `maximum speed of wetting', (b)
unbounded maximum speeds are obtained as the pressure is reduced only when slip
at the gas-liquid interface is allowed for and (c) the observed behaviour can
be rationalised by studying the dynamics of the gas film in front of the moving
contact line. A direct comparison to experimental results obtained in the
dip-coating process shows that the model recovers most trends but does not
accurately predict some of the high viscosity data at reduced pressures. This
discrepancy occurs because the gas flow enters the `transition regime', so that
more complex descriptions of its non-equilibrium nature are required. Finally,
by collapsing onto a master curve experimental data obtained for drop impact in
a reduced pressure gas, it is shown that the same physical mechanisms are also
likely to govern splash suppression phenomena.

moderate degrees of dissipation, the estimates of the two formalisms are in

cosmological model: $\Sigma_8$=$\sigma_8$ $(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.27)^{0.64}$=$0.79^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ for a flat $\Lambda\rm CDM$ cosmology
with $h=0.7\pm0.04$ ($68\%$ credible interval). Nevertheless our models provide
only moderately good fits as indicated by $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=2.9$, including a
$20\%$ r.m.s. uncertainty in the predicted signal amplitude. The models cannot
explain a signal drop on scales around 15 arcmin, which may be caused by
systematics. It is unclear whether the discrepancy can be fully explained by
residual PSF systematics of which we find evidence at least on scales of a few
arcmin. Therefore we need a better understanding of higher-order correlations
of cosmic shear and their systematics to confidently apply them as cosmological
probes.

limit of random planar maps. We strengthen the so-called confluence of
geodesics phenomenon observed at the root of the map, and with this, reveal
several properties of its rich geodesic structure.
  Our main result is the continuity of the cut locus at typical points. A small
shift from such a point results in a small, local modification to the cut
locus. Moreover, the cut locus is uniformly stable, in the sense that any two
cut loci coincide outside a closed, nowhere dense set of zero measure.
  We obtain similar stability results for the set of points inside geodesics to
a fixed point. Furthermore, we show that the set of points inside geodesics of
the map is of first Baire category. Hence, most points in the Brownian map are
endpoints.
  Finally, we classify the types of geodesic networks which are dense. For each
$k\in\{1,2,3,4,6,9\}$, there is a dense set of pairs of points which are joined
by networks of exactly $k$ geodesics and of a specific topological form. We
find the Hausdorff dimension of the set of pairs joined by each type of

a chemical potential $\sim$145 meV above the Dirac point and in the bulk gap.
The CR broadens at high fields, an effect that we attribute to an
electron-phonon interaction. This assignment is supported by an extended Drude

constraints. We mainly consider undirected graphs of $n$ vertices, where each
edge has an associated set of discrete availability instances (labels). A
journey from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is a path from $u$ to $v$ where
successive path edges have strictly increasing labels. A graph is temporally
connected iff there is a $(u,v)$-journey for any pair of vertices $u,v,~u\not=
v$. We first give a simple polynomial-time algorithm to check whether a given
temporal graph is temporally connected. We then consider the case in which a
designer of temporal graphs can \emph{freely choose} availability instances for
all edges and aims for temporal connectivity with very small \emph{cost}; the
cost is the total number of availability instances used. We achieve this via a
simple polynomial-time procedure which derives designs of cost linear in $n$.
We also show that the above procedure is (almost) optimal when the underlying
graph is a tree, by proving a lower bound on the cost for any tree. However,
there are pragmatic cases where one is not free to design a temporally
connected graph anew, but is instead \emph{given} a temporal graph design with
the claim that it is temporally connected, and wishes to make it more
cost-efficient by removing labels without destroying temporal connectivity
(redundant labels). Our main technical result is that computing the maximum
number of redundant labels is APX-hard, i.e., there is no PTAS unless $P=NP$.
On the positive side, we show that in dense graphs with random edge
availabilities, there is asymptotically almost surely a very large number of
redundant labels. A temporal design may, however, be \emph{minimal}, i.e., no
redundant labels exist. We show the existence of minimal temporal designs with
at least $n \log{n}$ labels.

XMM-Newton observation. Our INTEGRAL investigation discovered for the first
time an unusually long X-ray activity (3-60 keV) which continuously lasted for
at least 11 days, i.e. a significant fraction (about 60%) of the entire orbital
period, and spanned orbital phases corresponding to both periastron and
apastron passages. This prolongated X-ray activity is at odds with the much
shorter durations marking outbursts from classical SFXTs especially above 20
keV, as such it represents a departure from their nominal behavior and it adds
a further extreme characteristic to the already extreme SFXT IGR J18483-0311.
Our IBIS/ISGRI high energy investigation (100-250 keV) of archival outbursts
activity from the source showed that the recently reported hint of a possible
hard X-ray tail is not real and it is likely due to noisy background. The new
XMM-Newton targeted observation did not detect any sign of strong X-ray
outburst activity from the source despite being performed close to its
periastron passage, on the contrary IGR J18483-0311 was caught during the
common intermediate X-ray state with a low luminosity value of 3x10^33 erg s^-1

alternatively, as an infall velocity and show that these two criteria give
almost identical results. To better illustrate the implications of this
definition, we applied our criteria to some prominent structures in the local
Universe, the Local supercluster, Shapley supercluster, and the recently
reported Laniakea supercluster to understand their future evolution. We find
that for the Local and Shapley superclusters, only the central regions will
collapse in the future, while Laniakea does not constitute a significant
overdensity and will disperse in the future. Finally, we suggest that those
superclusters that will survive the accelerating cosmic expansion and collapse
in the future be called ""superstes-clusters"", where ""superstes"" means survivor
in Latin, to distinguish them from traditional superclusters.

maintaining an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of
the best submission of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem
particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants
are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they
may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few
theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable
leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood
heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of
re-submission.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of ""leaderboard accuracy"" tailored to the

and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees
in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial
attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from an actual

  Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for
adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a
seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a
completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a

east-bound and north-bound cars moving by turns on a square lattice, has been
an underpinning model in the study of collective behaviour by cars, pedestrians
and even internet packages. Contrary to initial beliefs that the model exhibits
a sharp phase transition from freely flowing to fully jammed, it has been
reported that it shows intermediate stable phases, where jams and freely
flowing traffic coexist, but there is no clear understanding of their origin.
Here, we analyze the model as an anisotropic system with a preferred fluid
direction (north-east) and find that it exhibits two differentiated phase
transitions: either if the system is longer in the flow direction
(longitudinal) or perpendicular to it (transversal). The critical densities
where these transitions occur enclose the density interval of intermediate
states and can be approximated by mean-field analysis, all derived from the
anisotropic exponent relating the longitudinal and transversal correlation
lengths. Thus, we arrive to the interesting result that the puzzling
intermediate states in the original model are just a superposition of these two
different behaviours of the phase transition, solving by the way most mysteries
behind the BML model, which turns to be a paradigmatic example of such
anisotropic critical systems.

graphs, whose structure gives significant insights about how these systems
work. Network theory has undergone further developments, in particular in
relation to detection of communities in graphs, to catch this structure.
Recently, an approach has been proposed to transform a graph into a collection
of signals: Using a multidimensional scaling technique on a distance matrix
representing relations between vertices of the graph, points in a Euclidean
space are obtained and interpreted as signals, indexed by the vertices. In this
article, we propose several extensions to this approach, developing a framework
to study graph structures using signal processing tools. We first extend the
current methodology, enabling us to highlight connections between properties of
signals and graph structures, such as communities, regularity or randomness, as
well as combinations of those. A robust inverse transformation method is next
described, taking into account possible changes in the signals compared to
original ones. This technique uses, in addition to the relationships between
the points in the Euclidean space, the energy of each signal, coding the
different scales of the graph structure. These contributions open up new
perspectives in the study of graphs, by enabling processing of graphs through
the processing of the corresponding collection of signals, using reliable tools
from signal processing. A technique of denoising of a graph by filtering of the
corresponding signals is then described, suggesting considerable potential of
the approach.
