ages and others of stars with heterogeneous ages as the field stars. To explain
these facts, we have constructed a simple model of three phases. Phase A: a
giant interstellar cloud is uniformly accelerated (or decelerated) with respect
to the field stars during a relatively short period of time (10 Myr) and the
cloud's mass is uniformly increased; phase B: the acceleration (or
deceleration) and mass accretion of the cloud cease. The star formation spreads
throughout the cloud, giving origin to stellar groups of similar ages; and
phase C: the cloud loses all its gaseous component at a constant rate and in
parallel is uniformly decelerated (or accelerated) until reaching the initial
velocity of phase A (case 1) or the velocity of the gas cloud remains constant
(case 2). Both cases give equivalent results. The system equations for the star
motions governed by a time-dependent gravitational potential of the giant cloud
and referred to a coordinate system co-moving with the cloud have been solved
analytically. We have assumed a homogeneous spheroidal cloud of fixed
semi-major axis a=300 pc and of an initial density of 7 at cm^{-3}, with a
density increment of 100 per cent and a cloud's velocity variation of 30 km
s^{-1}, from the beginning to the end of Phase A. The result is that about 4
per cent of the field stars that are passing within the volume of the cloud at
the beginning of phase A is captured. The Sun itself could have been captured
by the same cloud that originated the moving groups of the solar neighbourhood.

tolerance, compared to single robot solutions. In this paper, we show how to
realize those possibilities when starting from a single robot system controlled

we are able to combine the fault tolerant properties of the BT, in terms of
built-in fallbacks, with the fault tolerance inherent in multi-robot
approaches, in terms of a faulty robot being replaced by another one.
Furthermore, we improve performance by identifying and taking advantage of the
opportunities of parallel task execution, that are present in the single robot
BT. Analyzing the proposed approach, we present results regarding how mission
performance is affected by minor faults (a robot losing one capability) as well
as major faults (a robot losing all its capabilities). Finally, a detailed

perspective for processing large-scale data associated with irregular domains.
In many practical applications, it is necessary to handle massive data sets
through complex networks, in which most nodes have limited computing power.
Designing efficient distributed algorithms is critical for this task. This
paper focuses on the distributed reconstruction of a time-varying bandlimited
graph signal based on observations sampled at a subset of selected nodes. A
distributed least square reconstruction (DLSR) algorithm is proposed to recover
the unknown signal iteratively, by allowing neighboring nodes to communicate
with one another and make fast updates. DLSR uses a decay scheme to annihilate
the out-of-band energy occurring in the reconstruction process, which is
inevitably caused by the transmission delay in distributed systems. Proof of
convergence and error bounds for DLSR are provided in this paper, suggesting
that the algorithm is able to track time-varying graph signals and perfectly
reconstruct time-invariant signals. The DLSR algorithm is numerically
experimented with synthetic data and real-world sensor network data, which
verifies its ability in tracking slowly time-varying graph signals.

its coupling to the background neutron condensate. The density dependence of
pairing of proton condensate implies that $H_{c2}$ is maximal at the crust-core

magnetar cores with homogenous constant fields will be partially

in a twofold manner: (i)~the $B$-field assisted direct Urca process is enhanced
by orders of magnitude, because of the unpairing effect in regions where $B\ge

develop a simplistic approach that considers first the production of jets in a
pp collision as described by PYTHIA. From each pp collision, the value of the
energy of the parton from the proton participating in the hard scattering is
extracted. Then, the underlying event is generated simulating a pPb collision
through HIJING, but with the energy of the proton decreased according to the

This model is able to capture the bulk of the centrality effect for central to

the receiver and sender have at their disposal a noiseless feedback channel of
unlimited quantum capacity, generalizing Shannon's zero-error communication
theory with instantaneous feedback.
  We first show that this capacity is a function only of the linear span of
Choi-Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite
equivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub ""non-commutative
bipartite graph"". Then we go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is
non-zero (with constant activating noiseless communication) if and only if the
non-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent
characterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the
""conclusive exclusion"" of quantum states [Pusey/Barrett/Rudolph, Nature Phys.

  We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity,
motivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved later by
Ahlswede. We demonstrate this bound to have many good properties, including
being additive and given by a minimax formula. We also prove that this quantity
is the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel
from the set of all channels with the same Choi-Kraus span, which can also be
interpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on
a generalization of the ""Postselection Lemma"" [Christandl/Koenig/Renner, PRL

information about the Higgs couplings without assumptions on the Higgs boson
total width. We assess the sensitivity of the high-mass region to Higgs
coupling strengths, considering all vector boson pair channels, $W^-W^+$,
$W^\pm W^\pm$, $W^\pm Z$ and $ZZ$. Because of the small background, the most
promising mode is $W^+ W^+$ which has sensitivity to Higgs couplings because of
Higgs boson exchange in the $t$-channel. Using the Caola-Melnikov (CM) method,
the off-shell couplings can be interpreted as bounds on the Higgs boson total
width. We estimate the bound that can be obtained with current data, as well as
the bounds that could be obtained at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV in the VBF channel for
data samples of 100 and 300 fb$^{-1}$. The CM method has already been

calculus originally developed by Collins and Williams to model closed FLRW
universes. We consider two types of lattice universes, one where all masses are
identical to each other and another where one mass gets perturbed in magnitude.
In the unperturbed universe, we consider the possible arrangements of the
masses in the Regge Cauchy surfaces and demonstrate that the model will only be
stable if each mass lies within some spherical region of convergence. We also
briefly discuss the existence of Regge models that are dual to the ones we have
considered. We then model a perturbed lattice universe and demonstrate that the
model's evolution is well-behaved, with the expansion increasing in magnitude
as the perturbation is increased.

systems that can be analyzed early in the design cycle to try to lower cost,

architectural descriptions and compositional reasoning rules, these techniques
can be used to prove important safety properties about the architecture prior
to system construction. Such proofs build from ""leaf-level"" assume/guarantee
component contracts through architectural layers towards top-level safety
properties. The proofs are built upon the premise that each leaf-level
component contract is realizable; i.e., it is possible to construct a component
such that for any input allowed by the contract assumptions, there is some
output value that the component can produce that satisfies the contract
guarantees. Without engineering support it is all too easy to write leaf-level
components that can't be realized. Realizability checking for propositional
contracts has been well-studied for many years, both for component synthesis
and checking correctness of temporal logic requirements. However, checking
realizability for contracts involving infinite theories is still an open
problem. In this paper, we describe a new approach for checking realizability
of contracts involving theories and demonstrate its usefulness on several

accompanied by the adjacent minimum of the specific heat dependence on the

Applied field leads to the increase of the heat capacity and formation of the

the influence of the associated electric potential. A remarkable feature of the
Fermi grand canonical ensemble is, at any BC combination in zero fields, a
salient maximum of $c_V$ observed on the $T$ axis for one particle and its
absence for any other number $N$ of corpuscles. Qualitative and quantitative
explanation of this phenomenon employs the analysis of the chemical potential

being positive (negative) for the ground (excited) states. Simple two-level

in this case the admixture of only the neighboring states plays a dominant
role. Different magnitudes of the polarization for different BCs in this regime
are explained physically and confirmed numerically. Hellmann-Feynman theorem
reveals a fundamental relation between the polarization and the speed of the

published ""On the quantum theory of line-spectra."" There, the adiabatic

the principle of mechanical transformability. In the subsequent variations of
his theory, Bohr never suppressed this principle completely. We discuss the
role of Ehrenfest's principle in the works of Bohr, paying special attention to
its relation to the correspondence principle. We will also consider how
Ehrenfest faced Bohr's uses of his more celebrated contribution to quantum

first instrument capable of spatially resolving the remnant above 15 keV. We
find that the emission is not entirely dominated by the forward shock nor by a
smooth ""bright ring"" at the reverse shock. Instead we find that the $>$15 keV
emission is dominated by knots near the center of the remnant and dimmer
filaments near the remnant's outer rim. These regions are fit with unbroken
power-laws in the 15--50 keV bandpass, though the central knots have a steeper
($\Gamma \sim -3.35$) spectrum than the outer filaments ($\Gamma \sim -3.06$).
We argue this difference implies that the central knots are located in the 3-D
interior of the remnant rather than at the outer rim of the remnant and seen in
the center due to projection effects. The morphology of $>$15 keV emission does
not follow that of the radio emission nor that of the low energy ($<$12 keV)
X-rays, leaving the origin of the $>$15 keV emission as an open mystery. Even
at the forward shock front we find less steepening of the spectrum than
expected from an exponentially cut off electron distribution with a single
cutoff energy. Finally, we find that the GeV emission is not associated with
the bright features in the {\it NuSTAR} band while the TeV emission may be,
suggesting that both hadronic and leptonic emission mechanisms may be at work.

mechanisms regulating star formation. However, the exact physical processes

resolution observations of the Br Gamma emitting region in the Herbig Ae star
HD163296 (MWC275) in order to probe the origin of this line and constrain the
physical processes taking place at sub-AU scales in the circumstellar region.
By means of VLTI-AMBER observations at high spectral resolution (R~12000), we
studied interferometric visibilities, wavelength-differential phases, and
closure phases across the Br Gamma line of HD163296. To constrain the physical
origin of the Br Gamma line in Herbig Ae stars, all the interferometric
observables were compared with the predictions of a line radiative transfer
disc wind model. The measured visibilities clearly increase within the Br Gamma
line, indicating that the Br Gamma emitting region is more compact than the
continuum. By fitting a geometric Gaussian model to the continuum-corrected Br
Gamma visibilities, we derived a compact radius of the Br Gamma emitting region
of ~0.07+/-0.02AU (Gaussian half width at half maximum; or a ring-fit radius of
~0.08+/-0.02AU). To interpret the observations, we developed a
magneto-centrifugally driven disc wind model. Our best disc wind model is able
to reproduce, within the errors, all the interferometric observables and it
predicts a launching region with an outer radius of ~0.04AU. However, the
intensity distribution of the entire disc wind emitting region extends up to
~0.16AU. Our observations, along with a detailed modelling of the Br Gamma
emitting region, suggest that most of the Br Gamma emission in HD163296
originates from a disc wind with a launching region that is over five times
more compact than previous estimates of the continuum dust rim radius.

optical excitation is tuned to a mid-infrared vibrational resonance that

coupling in this material. This effect is evidenced by the appearance of a
longitudinal plasma mode reminiscent of a Josephson plasma resonance. We find
that coherent interlayer coupling can be generated up to the charge order
transition $T_{CO} \approx$ 80 K, far above the equilibrium superconducting
transition temperature of any lanthanide cuprate. Two key observations are
extracted from the relaxation kinetics of the interlayer coupling. Firstly, the
plasma mode relaxes through a collapse of its coherence length and not its
density. Secondly, two distinct kinetic regimes are observed for this
relaxation, above and below spin order transition $T_{SO} =$ 25 K. Especially,
the temperature independent relaxation rate observed below $T_{SO}$ is
anomalous and suggests coexistence of superconductivity and stripes rather than
competition. Both observations support arguments that a low temperature
coherent stripe (or pair density wave) phase suppresses c-axis tunnelling by
disruptive interference rather than by depleting the condensate.

implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and

received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either
in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a
single machine. Our main focus is on the underlying theory and practical
implementation of random projection and random sampling algorithms for very
large very overdetermined (i.e., overconstrained) $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
regression problems. Randomization can be used in one of two related ways:
either to construct sub-sampled problems that can be solved, exactly or
approximately, with traditional numerical methods; or to construct
preconditioned versions of the original full problem that are easier to solve
with traditional iterative algorithms. Theoretical results demonstrate that in
near input-sparsity time and with only a few passes through the data one can
obtain very strong relative-error approximate solutions, with high probability.
Empirical results highlight the importance of various trade-offs (e.g., between
the time to construct an embedding and the conditioning quality of the
embedding, between the relative importance of computation versus communication,
etc.) and demonstrate that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regression problems can be
solved to low, medium, or high precision in existing distributed systems on up

classical oracle inequalities. Thus, our sup-norm bound is tailored to
consistent variable selection via thresholding.

periodicity in its GeV emission. In this paper, we show that during the epochs
when the timing analysis fails to determine the orbital periodicity, the
periodicity is in fact present in the two orbital phase intervals $\Phi =
0.0-0.5$ and $\Phi = 0.5-1.0$. That is, there are two periodic signals, one
towards periastron (i.e., $\Phi = 0.0-0.5$) and another one towards apastron
($\Phi = 0.5-1.0$). The apastron peak shows the same orbital shift as the radio
outburst and, in addition, reveals the same two periods $P_1$ and $P_2$ that
are present in the radio data. The gamma-ray emission of the apastron peak
normally just broadens the emission of the peak around periastron. Only when it
appears at $\Phi = 0.8-1.0$, because of the orbital shift, it is detached
enough from the first peak to become recognizable as a second orbital peak,
which is the reason why the timing analysis fails. Two gamma-ray peaks along
the orbit are predicted by the two-peak accretion model for an eccentric orbit
that was proposed by several authors for LS I +61{\deg}303.

this correction, molecular density functional theory gives, at a modest
computational cost, quantitative hydration free energies and structures of
small molecular solutes like n-alkanes, and of hard sphere solutes whose radii
range from angstroms to nanometers. The macroscopic liquid-gas surface tension
predicted by the theory is comparable to experiments. This theory gives an

origin of the prompt gamma-ray spectrum. Its general non-thermal character and
the softness in the X-ray band remain unexplained. We tackle these issues by
performing Monte Carlo simulations of radiation-matter interactions in a
scattering dominated photon-lepton plasma. The plasma -- initially in
equilibrium -- is driven to non-equilibrium conditions by a sudden energy
injection in the lepton population, mimicking the effect of a shock wave or the
dissipation of magnetic energy. Equilibrium restoration occurs due to energy
exchange between the photons and leptons. While the initial and final
equilibrium spectra are thermal, the transitional photon spectra are
characterized by non-thermal features such as power-law tails, high energy
bumps, and multiple components. Such non-thermal features are observed at
infinity if the dissipation occurs at small to moderate optical depths, and the
spectrum is released before thermalization is complete. We model the synthetic
spectra with a Band function and show that the resulting spectral parameters
are similar to observations for a frequency range of 2-3 orders of magnitude
around the peak. In addition, our model predicts correlations between the
low-frequency photon index and the peak frequency as well as between the low-
and high-frequency indices. We explore baryon and pair dominated fireballs and
reach the conclusion that baryonic fireballs are a better model for explaining
the observed features of gamma-ray burst spectra.

reconstruct the shape of the initial wavefunction after a particular time

results pave the way for the generation of peculiar many-body interference

association into question. Observational data sets are large and complex.
Multiple testing and multiple modeling can lead to false positive findings.
Publication, confirmation and other biases are also possible problems.
  Moreover, the fact that most data sets used in studies evaluating the
relationships among air quality and public health outcomes are not publicly
available makes reproducing the claims nearly impossible. Here we have built
and made publicly available a dataset containing daily air quality levels,
PM2.5 and ozone, daily temperature levels, minimum and maximum and daily
relative humidity levels for the eight most populous California air basins. We
analyzed the dataset using a moving median analysis, a standard time series
analysis, and a prediction analysis within the following analysis strategy. We
examine the eight air basins separately to see if estimates replicate across
locations. We use leave one year out cross validation analysis to evaluate
predictions. Both the moving medians analysis and the standard time series
analysis found little evidence for association between air quality and acute
deaths. The prediction analysis process was a run as a large factorial design
using different models and holding out one year at a time. Among the variables
used to predict acute death, most of the daily death variability was explained
by time of year or weather variables. In summary, the empirical evidence is
that current levels of air quality, ozone and PM2.5, are not causally related
to acute deaths for California. An empirical and logical case can be made air
quality is not causally related to acute deaths for the rest of the United

the rich and diverse phenomenologies of heterotic strings exhibiting spacetime
supersymmetry. Unfortunately, during this same period, there has been
relatively little work studying the phenomenologies associated with their
non-supersymmetric counterparts. The primary reason for this relative lack of
attention is the fact that strings without spacetime supersymmetry are
generally unstable, exhibiting large one-loop dilaton tadpoles. In this paper,
we demonstrate that this hurdle can be overcome in a class of tachyon-free
four-dimensional string models realized through coordinate-dependent
compactifications. Moreover, as we shall see, it is possible to construct
models in this class whose low-lying states resemble the Standard Model (or
even potential unified extensions thereof) --- all without any light
superpartners, and indeed without supersymmetry at any energy scale. The
existence of such models thus opens the door to general studies of
non-supersymmetric string phenomenology, and in this paper we proceed to
discuss a variety of theoretical and phenomenological issues associated with
such non-supersymmetric strings. On the theoretical side, we discuss the
finiteness properties of such strings, the general characteristics of their
mass spectra, the magnitude and behavior of their one-loop cosmological
constants, and their interpolation properties. By contrast, on the
phenomenological side, the properties we discuss are more model-specific and
include their construction techniques, their natural energy scales, their
particle and charge assignments, and the magnitudes of their associated Yukawa

inequalities. Such non-local correlations illustrate the advantage of quantum
resources over classical resources. Here, we study quantitatively Bell
inequalities with $2\times n$ inputs. As found in [N. Gisin et al., Int. J. Q.
Inf. 5, 525 (2007)] quantum mechanical correlations cannot reach the algebraic
bound for such inequalities. In this paper, we uncover the heart of this effect
which we call the {\it fraction of determinism}. We show that any quantum
statistics with two parties and $2 \times n$ inputs exhibits nonzero fraction
of determinism, and we supply a quantitative bound for it. We then apply it to
provide an explicit {\it universal upper bound} for Bell inequalities with
$2\times n$ inputs. As our main mathematical tool we introduce and prove a {\it
reverse triangle inequality}, stating in a quantitative way that if some states
are far away from a given state, then their mixture is also. The inequality is
crucial in deriving the lower bound for the fraction of determinism, but is
also of interest on its own.

increasingly small contribution to the ionising background at the HI Lyman
limit. It is then generally though that massive stars in (pre-)galactic systems
may provide the additional ionising flux needed to complete HI reionisation by
z>6. A galaxy dominated background, however, may require that the escape
fraction of Lyman continuum radiation from high redshift galaxies is as high as
10%, a value somewhat at odds with (admittedly scarce) observational
constraints. High escape fractions from dwarf galaxies have been advocated, or,
alternatively, a so-far undetected (or barely detected) population of
unobscured, high-redshift faint AGNs. Here we question the latter hypothesis,
and show that such sources, to be consistent with the measured level of the
unresolved X-ray background at z=0, can provide a fraction of the HII filling
factor not larger than 13% by z=6. The fraction rises to <27% in the somewhat
extreme case of a constant comoving redshift evolution of the AGN emissivity.
This still calls for a mean escape fraction of ionising photons from high-z
galaxies >10%.

sufficiently large masses, they can via loop effects drive the mass parameter
of the inert scalar contained in the model towards negative values. This
behaviour leads to a breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry built into
the model which is paramount to keeping the setting consistent at low energies
- without it the model would lose its Dark Matter candidate and the neutrino
mass would not be naturally suppressed. Thus, if the breaking occurs at a

power of both the power spectrum and bispectrum at large scales. Based on the

last stages of this process, the holes undergo an extremely loud phase of
gravitational wave emission, possibly detectable by current and future probes.
The theoretical effort towards obtaining a coherent physical picture of the
binary path down to coalescence is still underway. In this paper, for the first
time, we take advantage of observational studies of active galactic nuclei
evolution to constrain the efficiency of gas-driven binary decay. Under
conservative assumptions we find that gas accretion toward the nuclear black
holes can efficiently lead binaries of any mass forming at high redshift (> 2)
to coalescence within the current time. The observed ""downsizing"" trend of the
accreting black hole luminosity function further implies that the gas inflow is
sufficient to drive light black holes down to coalescence, even if they bind in
binaries at lower redshifts, down to z~0.5 for binaries of ~10 million solar
masses, and z~0.2 for binaries of ~1 million solar masses. This has strong
implications for the detection rates of coalescing black hole binaries of

thin limit. We present physical arguments for clouds to be significantly
accelerated by a radiation force due to lines during a nonlinear phase of the
instability. To qualitatively illustrate our main points, we perform both one
and two-dimensional (1-D/2-D) hydrodynamical simulations that allow us to study
the nonlinear outcome of the evolution of thermally unstable gas subjected to
this radiation force. Our 1-D simulations demonstrate that the thermal
instability can produce long-lived clouds that reach a thermal equilibrium
between radiative processes and thermal conduction, while the radiation force
can indeed accelerate the clouds to supersonic velocities. However, our 2-D

massive stars following the collapse of the stars' iron cores, is obtained due
to energy deposition by neutrinos. So far, this scenario was not demonstrated
from first principles. Kushnir and Katz (2014) have recently shown, by using
one-dimensional simulations, that if the neutrinos failed to explode the star,
a thermonuclear explosion of the outer shells is possible for some (tuned)
initial profiles. However, the energy released was small and negligible amounts
of ejected $^{56}$Ni were obtained, implying that these one-dimensional
collapse induced thermonuclear explosions (CITE) are unlikely to represent
typical CCSNe. Here I provide evidence supporting a scenario in which the
majority of CCSNe are the result of CITE. I use two-dimensional simulations to
show that collapse of stars that include slowly (few percent of breakup)
rotating $\sim0.1-10\,M_{\odot}$ shells of mixed helium-oxygen, leads to an
ignition of a thermonuclear detonation wave that unbinds the stars' outer
layers. Simulations of massive stars with different properties show that CITE
is a robust process, and results in explosions with kinetic energies in the
range of $10^{49}-10^{52}\,\textrm{erg}$, and $^{56}$Ni yields of up to
$\sim\,M_{\odot}$, which are correlated, in agreement with observations for the
majority of CCSNe. Stronger explosions are predicted from higher mass
progenitors that leave more massive remnants, in contrast to the neutrino
mechanism. Neutron stars are produced in weak ($\lt10^{51}\,\textrm{erg}$)
explosions, while strong ($\gt10^{51}\,\textrm{erg}$) explosions leave black

redshifted orbital period $(1+z)t_{\rm bin}$ of a putative supermassive black
hole binary (SMBHB). Here we consider the implications of a $3-8$ times shorter
orbital period, suggested by hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary discs
(CBDs) with nearly equal--mass SMBHBs ($q\equiv M_2/M_1\gtrsim 0.3$). With the
corresponding $2-4$ times tighter binary separation, PG 1302 would be
undergoing gravitational wave dominated inspiral, and serve as a proof that the
BHs can be fueled and produce bright emission even in this late stage of the
merger. The expected fraction of binaries with the shorter $t_{\rm bin}$, among
bright quasars, would be reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude, compared to the
5.2 year period, in better agreement with the rarity of candidates reported by
Graham et al. (2015). Finally, shorter periods would imply higher binary
speeds, possibly imprinting periodicity on the light curves from relativistic
beaming, as well as measurable relativistic effects on the Fe K$\alpha$ line.
The CBD model predicts additional periodic variability on timescales of $t_{\rm
bin}$ and $\approx 0.5 t_{\rm bin}$, as well as periodic variation of broad
line widths and offsets relative to the narrow lines, which are consistent with
the observations. Future observations will be able to test these predictions
and hence the binary+CBD hypothesis for PG 1302.

analyse the periodogram of PG1302 and find no compelling evidence for
additional peaks. We derive upper limits on any additional periodic modulations
in the available data, by modeling the light-curve as the sum of red noise and
the known 5.2 yr periodic component, and injecting additional sinusoidal
signals. We find that, with the current data, we would be able to detect with
high significance (false alarm probability <1%) secondary periodic terms with
periods in the range predicted by the simulations, if the amplitude of the

independent of $n$. This gives a uniform treatment of homological stability for
the families of Coxeter groups of type $A_n$, $B_n$ and $D_n$, recovering
existing results in the first two cases, and giving a new result in the third.
The key step in our proof is to show that a certain simplicial complex with
$W_n$-action is highly connected. To do this we show that the barycentric
subdivision is an instance of the 'basic construction', and then use Davis's
description of the basic construction as an increasing union of chambers to
deduce the required connectivity.

inconsistent truncation of non-perturbative effects that unitarize the
semiclassical black hole. Namely, we show that a naive truncation of quantum
corrections to the Hawking spectrum at order ${\cal O}(e^{-S})$, inexorably
leads to a ""localised'' divergent energy density near the black hole horizon.
Nevertheless, in the same approximation, a distant observer only sees a
discretised spectrum and concludes that unitarity is achieved by ${\cal
O}(e^{-S})$ effects. This is due to the fact that instead, the correct quantum
corrections to the Hawking spectrum go like ${\cal O}( g^{tt} e^{-S})$.
Therefore, while at a distance far away from the horizon, where $g^{tt}\approx
1$, quantum corrections {\it are} perturbative, they {\it do} diverge close to
the horizon, where $g^{tt}\rightarrow \infty$. Nevertheless, these
""corrections"" nicely re-sum so that correlations functions are smooth at the
would-be black hole horizon. Thus, we conclude that the appearance of firewalls
is just a signal of the breaking of the semiclassical approximation at the Page
time, even for large black holes.

the interstellar medium (ISM) and are becoming workhorse diagnostics for
galaxies throughout the universe. Our goal is to explain the differences and
trends observed in the FIR line emission of dwarf galaxies compared to more
metal-rich galaxies. We present Herschel PACS spectroscopic observations of the
CII157um, OI63 and 145um, OIII88um, NII122 and 205um, and NIII57um
fine-structure cooling lines in a sample of 48 low-metallicity star-forming
galaxies of the guaranteed time key program Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We correlate
PACS line ratios and line-to-LTIR ratios with LTIR, LTIR/LB, metallicity, and
FIR color, and interpret the observed trends in terms of ISM conditions and
phase filling factors with Cloudy radiative transfer models. We find that the
FIR lines together account for up to 3 percent of LTIR and that star-forming
regions dominate the overall emission in dwarf galaxies. Compared to metal-rich
galaxies, the ratios of OIII/NII122 and NIII/NII122 are high, indicative of
hard radiation fields. In the photodissociation region (PDR), the CII/OI63
ratio is slightly higher than in metal-rich galaxies, with a small increase
with metallicity, and the OI145/OI63 ratio is generally lower than 0.1,
demonstrating that optical depth effects should be small on the scales probed.
The OIII/OI63 ratio can be used as an indicator of the ionized gas/PDR filling
factor, and is found ~4 times higher in the dwarfs than in metal-rich galaxies.
The high CII/LTIR, OI/LTIR, and OIII/LTIR ratios, which decrease with
increasing LTIR and LTIR/LB, are interpreted as a combination of moderate FUV
fields and low PDR covering factor. Harboring compact phases of low filling
factor and a large volume filling factor of diffuse gas, the ISM of
low-metallicity dwarf galaxies has a more porous structure than that in
metal-rich galaxies.

for integrating new sensory evidence. Based on a probabilistic framework, we
investigated the alternative hypothesis that time is used for gradually
refining an internal estimate of uncertainty, that is to obtain an increasingly
accurate approximation of the posterior distribution through collecting samples
from it. In the context of a simple orientation estimation task, we
analytically derived predictions of how humans should behave under the two
hypotheses, and identified the across-trial correlation between error and
subjective uncertainty as a proper assay to distinguish between them. Next, we
developed a novel experimental paradigm that could be used to reliably measure
these quantities, and tested the predictions derived from the two hypotheses.
We found that in our task, humans show clear evidence that they use time mostly
for probabilistic sampling and not for evidence integration. These results
provide the first empirical support for iteratively improving probabilistic
representations in perceptual decision making, and open the way to reinterpret
the role of time in the cortical processing of complex sensory information.

a given luminosity of different period-luminosity sequences. This leads to the
conclusion that the masses of stars at the same luminosity on the different
period-luminosity sequences are different. An evolutionary scenario is used to
show that the masses of stars on adjacent sequences differ by about 16-26% at a
given luminosity, with the shorter period sequence being more massive. The mass
is also shown to vary across each sequence by a similar percentage, with the
mass increasing to shorter periods. On one sequence, sequence B, the mass
distribution is shown to be bimodal. It is shown that the small amplitude
variables on sequences A', A and B pulsate in radial and nonradial modes of
angular degree l=0, 1 and 2, with the l=1 mode being the most common. The stars
on sequences C' and C are predominantly radial pulsators (l=0). Matching period
ratios to pulsation models shows that the radial pulsation modes associated

recently, the observation of strong and sharp magnetic exciton modes forming in

suggested a significant contribution of itinerant electrons to the spin
dynamics. Here we investigate the evolution of the AFQ excitation upon the
application of an external magnetic field and the substitution of Ce with
non-magnetic La, both parameters known to suppress the AFM phase. We find that
the exciton energy decreases proportionally to T_N upon doping. In field, its
intensity is suppressed, while its energy remains constant. Its disappearance
above the critical field of the AFM phase is preceded by the formation of two
modes, whose energies grow linearly with magnetic field upon entering the AFQ
phase. These findings suggest a crossover from itinerant to localized spin
dynamics between the two phases, the coupling to heavy-fermion quasiparticles
being crucial for a comprehensive description of the magnon spectrum.

find that in the case of the Lyman-break galaxies it is important to account
for the surface brightness profiles of both the foreground and the background

criterion for the background galaxies that can actually be observed. Not taking

structures are considered in the model of interacting quark-gluon strings. We
assume that at the given energy of nucleus-nucleus collisions the critical
energy density may be reached at the specific centrality. In a string
percolation model this might be treated equivalently to a formation of a large
cluster of strings characterized by the critical string density, with a size
comparable to the whole area of interaction of two nuclei. This hypothesis
allows to define some constraints on the string percolation model using data on
transitional centralities in Au-Au collisions at these two energies. Results
are extrapolated to the LHC energy where high string densities (exceeding the
critical value) are confirmed for all classes of centralities in Pb-Pb
collisions.
  Interaction between strings inside large clusters formed in nucleus-nucleus
collisions is considered in a simplified Monte Carlo model. This model is
applied to the qualitative analysis of the onset of collectivity and the ridge
formation in Pb-Pb collisions. It is shown that the approach of the repulsive
string-string interaction is capable to explain the appearance of elliptic and
triangular flow observed in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC

half symmetric DoF is the highest possible value for the symmetric DoF in the
presence of interference. We show that when the condition is satisfied, there
always exists a set of carefully chosen transmitters in the network, such that
by retransmission of their symbols at an appropriate time slot, we can
neutralize all the interfering signals at the receivers. Quite surprisingly, we
also show that for any given network topology, if we cannot achieve half
symmetric DoF by retransmission-based schemes, then there does not exist any
linear scheme that can do so. We also consider a practical network scenario
that models cell edge users in a heterogeneous network, and show that the
characterized condition on the network topology occurs frequently. Furthermore,
we numerically evaluate the achievable rates of the DoF-optimal
retransmission-based scheme in such network scenario, and show that its
throughput gain is not restricted to the asymptotic DoF analysis.

The idea underneath was to touch those topics that can be considered hot
nowadays in the Galactic disk research: the reality of the thick disk, the
spiral structure of the Milky Way, and the properties of the outer Galactic
disk. A lot of work has been done in recent years on these topics, but a
coherent and clear picture is still missing. Detailed studies with high quality
spectroscopic data seem to support a dual Galactic disk, with a clear
separation into a thin and a thick component. Much confusion and very
discrepant ideas still exist concerning the spiral structure of the Milky Way.
Our location in the disk makes it impossible to observe it, and we can only
infer it. This process of inference is still far from being mature, and depends
a lot on the selected tracers, the adopted models and their limitations, which
in many cases are neither properly accounted for, nor pondered enough. Finally,
there are very different opinions on the size (scale length, truncation radius)
of the Galactic disk, and on the interpretation of the observed outer disk
stellar populations in terms either of external entities (Monoceros,
Triangulus-Andromeda, Canis Major), or as manifestations of genuine disk
properties (e.g., warp and flare).

spectra of multiple time series and cross-sectional outcomes when data are
observed from multiple subjects. The motivating application comes from sleep
medicine, where researchers are able to non-invasively record physiological
time series signals during sleep. The frequency patterns of these signals,
which can be quantified through the power spectrum, contain interpretable
information about biological processes. An important problem in sleep research
is drawing connections between power spectra of time series signals and
clinical characteristics; these connections are key to understanding biological
pathways through which sleep affects, and can be treated to improve, health.
Such analyses are challenging as they must overcome the complicated structure
of a power spectrum from multiple time series as a complex positive-definite
matrix-valued function. This article proposes a new approach to such analyses
based on a tensor-product spline model of Cholesky components of
outcome-dependent power spectra. The approach flexibly models power spectra as
nonparametric functions of frequency and outcome while preserving geometric
constraints. Formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, a Whittle likelihood
based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for automated
model fitting and for conducting inference on associations between outcomes and
spectral measures. The method is used to analyze data from a study of sleep in
older adults and uncovers new insights into how stress and arousal are
connected to the amount of time one spends in bed.

a ""sparse+dense"" model, in which the signal is given by the sum of a sparse

pulse-gated hybrid qubit is limited by relatively fast dephasing due to charge
noise during one of the two required gate operations. Here we perform the first
microwave-driven gate operations of a quantum dot hybrid qubit, avoiding
entirely the regime in which it is most sensitive to charge noise. Resonant
detuning modulation along with phase control of the microwaves enables a pi
rotation time of less than 5 ns (50 ps) around X(Z)-axis with high fidelities >
93 (96) %. We also implement Hahn echo and Carr-Purcell (CP) dynamic decoupling

optimal sampling of measurements for training sound-source localization (SSL)
models, and how can SSL models be used to infer the subject's HRTFs in

  Internal Covariate Shift",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters
of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower
learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.

demographic parameters, but a joint approach combining the strengths of both
analytical tools has not been developed. 2. We present an integrated model
combining known-fate and open N-mixture models, allowing the estimation of
detection probability, recruitment, and the joint estimation of survival. We
first use a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the model relative
to known values. We then provide an applied example using 4 years of wolf
survival data consisting of relocations of radio-collared wolves within packs
and counts of associated pack-mates. The model is implemented in both
maximum-likelihood and Bayesian frameworks using a new R package kfdnm and the
BUGS language. 3. The simulation results indicated that the integrated model
was able to reliably recover parameters with no evidence of bias, and estimates
were more precise under the joint model as expected. Results from the applied
example indicated that the marked sample of wolves was biased towards
individuals with higher apparent survival rates (including losses due to
mortality and emigration) than the unmarked pack-mates, suggesting estimates of
apparent survival based on joint estimation could be more representative of the
overall population. Estimates of recruitment were similar to direct
observations of pup production, and overlap of the credible intervals suggested
no clear differences in recruitment rates. 4. Our integrated model is a
practical approach for increasing the amount of information gained from future

gravitational-wave emission in binary neutron star mergers, after identifying a
new mechanism by which a secondary peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum is
produced. It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates
slower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This
secondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak
produced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial
oscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency
modulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such
as the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between
the two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks
between their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating
individual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses. These
findings are derived for equal-mass binaries without intrinsic neutron-star
spin analyzing hydrodynamical simulations without magnetic field effects. Our
classification scheme may form the basis for the construction of detailed
gravitational-wave templates of the post-merger phase. We find that the
quasi-radial oscillation frequency of the remnant decreases with the total
binary mass. For a given merger event our classification scheme may allow to
determine the proximity of the measured total binary mass to the threshold mass
for prompt black hole formation, which can, in turn, yield an estimate of the
maximum neutron-star mass.

interannual variability to interactions with other regional monsoon systems.
Therefore, changes in the nature of these relationships may contribute to
variability in monsoon strength over longer time scales. Previous attempts to
evaluate how proxy records from the Indonesian-Australian monsoon region
correspond to other records from the Indian and East Asian monsoon regions, as
well as to El Ni\~no-related proxy records, have been qualitiative, relying on
`curve-fitting' methods. Here, we seek a quantitative approach for identifying
coupling relationships between paleoclimate proxy records, employing
statistical techniques to compute the interdependence of two paleoclimate time
series. We verify the use of complex networks to identify coupling
relationships between modern climate indices. This method is then extended to a
set of paleoclimate proxy records from the Asian, Australasian and South
American regions spanning the past 9,000 years. The resulting networks
demonstrate the existence of coupling relationships between regional monsoon
systems on millennial time scales, but also highlight the transient nature of
teleconnections during this period. In the context of the northwest Australian
summer monsoon, we recognise a shift in coupling relationships from strong
interhemispheric links with East Asian and ITCZ-related proxy records in the
mid-Holocene to significantly weaker coupling in the later Holocene. Although
the identified links cannot explain the underlying physical processes leading
to coupling between regional monsoon systems, this method provides a step
towards understanding the role that changes in teleconnections play in
millennial- to orbital-scale climate variability.

candidate to probe the physical conditions and chemistry similar to those
expected in external starburst galaxies. We aim to probe the physical and
chemical structure of W49A on a spatial scale of ~0.8 pc based on the JCMT
Spectral Legacy Survey, which covers the frequency range between 330 and 373
GHz. The wide 2x2 arcminutes field and the high spectral resolution of the HARP
instrument on JCMT provides information on the spatial structure and kinematics
of the cloud. For species where multiple transitions are available, we estimate
excitation temperatures and column densities. We detected 255 transitions
corresponding to 60 species in the 330-373 GHz range at the center position of
W49A. Excitation conditions can be probed for 16 molecules. The chemical
composition suggests the importance of shock-, PDR-, and hot core chemistry.
Many molecular lines show a significant spatial extent across the maps
including high density tracers (e.g. HCN, HNC, CS, HCO+) and tracers of
UV-irradiation (e.g. CN and C2H). Large variations are seen between the
sub-regions with mostly blue-shifted emission toward the Eastern tail, mostly
red-shifted emission toward the Northern clump, and emission peaking around the
expected source velocity toward the South-west clump. A comparison of column
density ratios of characteristic species observed toward W49A to Galactic PDRs
suggests that while the chemistry toward the W49A center is driven by a
combination of UV-irradiation and shocks, UV-irradiation dominates for the
Northern Clump, Eastern tail, and South-west clump regions. A comparison to a
starburst galaxy and an AGN suggests similar C2H, CN, and H2CO abundances (with
respect to the dense gas tracer 34CS) between the ~0.8 pc scale probed for W49A
and the >1 kpc regions in external galaxies with global star-formation.

critical insights into planetary differentiation early in our Solar System's

(4) Vesta have suggested the presence of olivine on the surface. These
observations were reinforced by the discovery of olivine-rich HED meteorites
from Vesta in recent years. However, analysis of data from NASA's Dawn
spacecraft has shown that this olivine-bearing unit is actually impact melt in
the ejecta of Oppia crater. The lack of widespread mantle olivine, exposed
during the formation of the 19 km deep Rheasilvia basin on Vesta's South Pole,
further complicated this picture. Ammannito et al., (2013a) reported the
discovery of local scale olivine-rich units in the form of excavated material
from the mantle using the Visible and InfraRed spectrometer (VIR) on Dawn. Here
we explore alternative sources for the olivine in the northern hemisphere of
Vesta by reanalyzing the data from the VIR instrument using laboratory spectral
measurements of meteorites. We suggest that these olivine exposures could be
explained by the delivery of olivine-rich exogenic material. Based on our
spectral band parameters analysis, the lack of correlation between the location
of these olivine-rich terrains and possible mantle-excavating events, and
supported by observations of HED meteorites, we propose that a probable source
for olivine seen in the northern hemisphere are remnants of impactors made of
olivine-rich meteorites. Best match suggests these units are HED material mixed
with either ordinary chondrites, or with some olivine-dominated meteorites such
as R-chondrites.

optimization problems with linear constraints, aiming to resolve the dilemma
that almost all the existing modified versions of the directly extended ADMM,
although with convergent guarantee, often perform substantially worse than the
directly extended ADMM itself with no convergent guarantee. Specifically, in
each iteration, we use the multi-block semi-proximal ADMM with step-size at
least $1$ as the prediction step to generate a good prediction point, and then
make correction as small as possible for the middle $(p\!-\!2)$ blocks of the
prediction point. Among others, the step-size of the multi-block semi-proximal
ADMM is adaptively determined by the infeasibility ratio made up by the current
semi-proximal ADMM step for the one yielded by the last correction step. For
the proposed corrected semi-proximal ADMM, we establish the global convergence
results under a mild assumption, and apply it to the important class of doubly
nonnegative semidefinite programming (DNN-SDP) problems with many linear
equality and/or inequality constraints. Our extensive numerical tests show that
the corrected semi-proximal ADMM is superior to the directly extended ADMM with
step-size $\tau=1.618$ and the multi-block ADMM with Gaussian back substitution
\cite{HTY12,HY13}. It requires the least number of iterations for $70\%$ test
instances within the comparable computing time with that of the directly

that would be consensually agreed to be simple versus others that would be
consensually agreed to be complex - biological systems and human languages. I
argue that a crucial component is that of structural building block hierarchies
that, in the case of complex systems, correspond also to a functional
hierarchy. I argue that complexity is an emergent property of this
structural/functional hierarchy, induced by a property - fitness in the case of
biological systems and meaning in the case of languages - that links the
elements of this hierarchy across multiple scales. Additionally, I argue that
non-complex systems ""are"" while complex systems ""do"" so that the latter, in
distinction to physical systems, must be described not only in a space of
states but also in a space of update rules (strategies) which we do not know
how to specify. Further, the existence of structural/functional building block
hierarchies allows for the functional specialisation of structural modules as
amply observed in nature. Finally, we argue that there is at least one
measuring apparatus capable of measuring complexity as characterised in the
paper - the human brain itself.

apply the wringing technique (by Ahlswede) on the quantized inputs to obtain

backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and related problems. Here
we extend (with non-trivial updates) our multistep schemes in [W. Zhao, Y. Fu
and T. Zhou, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 36 (2014), pp. A1731-A1751.] to solve the
second order FBSDEs (2FBSDEs). The key feature of the multistep schemes is that
the Euler method is used to discrete the forward SDE, which dramatically
reduces the entire computational complexity. Moreover, it is shown that the
usual quantities of interest (e.g., the solution tuple $(Y_t, Z_t, A_t,
\Gamma_t)$ in the 2FBSDEs) are still of high order accuracy. Several numerical
examples are given to show the effective of the proposed numerical schemes.
Applications of our numerical schemes for stochastic optimal control problems

so far in the search for a single unifying principle that harmonizes (i) the
wave and particle natures of matter and radiation, both at the quantum and the
classical levels, on the one hand and (ii) the classical and quantum theories
of matter and radiation on the other hand. The famous paradoxes of quantum
theory, the mysterious nature of measurements in quantum theory and the
principal no-go theorems for hidden variables are first briefly reviewed. The
Koopman-von Neumann Hilbert space theory based on complex wave functions
underlying particle trajectories in classical phase space, is an important step
forward in that direction. It provides a clear and beautiful harmony of
classical waves and particles. Sudarshan has given an alternative but
equivalent formulation that shows that classical mechanics can be regarded as a
quantum theory with essentially hidden non-commuting variables. An extension of
KvNS theory to classical electrodynamics provides a sound Hilbert space
foundation to it and satisfactorily accounts for entanglement and
Bell-CHSH-like violations already observed in classical polarization optics. An
important new insight that has been obtained through these developments is that
entanglement and Bell-like inequality violations are neither unique signatures
of quantumness nor of non-locality---they are rather signatures of
non-separability. Finally, Sudarshan's proposed solution to the measurement
problem using KvNS theory for the measuring apparatus is sketched to show to
what extent wave and particles can be harmonized in quantum theory.

number beyond which computations fail to converge is found to increase with
increasing dimensionless solid elasticity parameter {\Gamma}, following the
trend Owens > FENE- P > Oldroyd-B. The highly shear thinning nature of Owens
model leads to the elastic solid always collapsing into the channel, for the
wide range of values of {\Gamma} considered here. In the case of the FENE-P and
Oldroyd-B models, however, the fluid-solid interface can be either within the
channel, or bulge outwards, depending on the value of {\Gamma}. This behaviour
differs considerably from predictions of earlier models that treat the
deformable solid as a zero-thickness membrane, in which case the membrane
always lies within the channel. The capacity of the solid wall to support both
pressure and shear stress, in contrast to the zero-thickness membrane that only
responds to pressure, is responsible for the observed difference. Compar- ison
of the stress and velocity fields in the channel for the three viscoelastic
fluids, with the predictions for a Newtonian fluid, reveals that shear thinning
rather than elasticity is the key source of the observed differences in

important to test the equality of large rank-based correlation matrices since
they are more robust to outliers and nonlinearity. Unlike the Pearson's case,
testing the equality of large rank-based statistics has not been well explored

framework for testing the equality of two large U-statistic based correlation

Our approach exploits extreme value statistics and the Jackknife estimator for
uncertainty assessment and is valid under a fully nonparametric model.
Theoretically, we develop a theory for testing the equality of U-statistic
based correlation matrices. We then apply this theory to study the problem of
testing large Kendall's tau correlation matrices and demonstrate its
optimality. For proving this optimality, a novel construction of least
favourable distributions is developed for the correlation matrix comparison.

  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CV stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) methods is essentially
to extract, from large (image) databases, a specified number of images similar
in visual and semantic content to a so-called query image. To bridge the
semantic gap that exists between the representation of an image by low-level
features (namely, colour, shape, texture) and its high-level semantic content
as perceived by humans, CBIR systems typically make use of the relevance
feedback (RF) mechanism. RF iteratively incorporates user-given inputs
regarding the relevance of retrieved images, to improve retrieval efficiency.
One approach is to vary the weights of the features dynamically via feature
reweighting. In this work, an attempt has been made to improve retrieval
accuracy by enhancing a CBIR system based on color features alone, through
implicit incorporation of shape information obtained through prior segmentation
of the images. Novel schemes for feature reweighting as well as for
initialization of the relevant set for improved relevance feedback, have also
been proposed for boosting performance of RF- based CBIR. At the same time, new
measures for evaluation of retrieval accuracy have been suggested, to overcome
the limitations of existing measures in the RF context. Results of extensive
experiments have been presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approaches.

use of bisimilarities simplifies equivalence proofs in calculi and opens a way

shown by Howe's method. Similarity is transferred back to LR on the basis of an
inductively defined similarity. The translation from the call-by-need letrec
calculus into the extended call-by-name lambda calculus is the composition of
two translations. The first translation replaces the call-by-need strategy by a
call-by-name strategy and its correctness is shown by exploiting infinite trees
which emerge by unfolding the letrec expressions. The second translation
encodes letrec-expressions by using multi-fixpoint combinators and its

emission of hot (20 MK) and super-hot (45 MK) plasmas. The hard X-ray spectrum
in both models is fitted by power laws. The observed peculiarities of the flare
are shown to be better explained in terms of the two-temperature model, in
which the super-hot plasma is located at the flare loop tops (or in the
magnetic cusp region). The formation of the super-hot plasma can be associated
with its heating through primary energy release and with the suppression of
thermal conduction. The anomalously high temperature (32.5 MK according to
GOES) is most likely to be an artefact of the method for calculating the
temperature based on two-channel GOES measurements in the one-temperature

combine them with optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (VISTA) photometry as well
as different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculate
line-of-sight extinction and distances. The extinction coefficients are then
compared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellar
parameters and position in the Galaxy. Within the errors of our method, our
work does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinction
coefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. We do not find any
evidence of the variation of E(J-H)/E(J-K) with the angle from the Galactic

model, close to the half-filling. The Harper model, which is a quasi-periodic
system, is different than other one dimensional systems with uncorrelated
disorder in the fact that it can be in the metallic regime. Nevertheless, the
PC for a wide range of parameters of the Harper model does not show typical
metallic behavior, although the system is in the metallic regime. This is a
result of the nature of the central band states, which are a hybridization of
Gaussian states localized in superlattice points. When the superlattice is not
commensurate with the system length, the PC behaves as in an insulator. Thus
even in the metallic regime a typical finite Harper model may exhibit a PC
expected from an insulator.

corrected loop quantum cosmology and teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity. A

molecule mass from only first three (two) measured cantilever (bridge) resonant
frequencies. However, in liquid solutions that are relevant to most of the
biological systems, the mass determination is challenging because the Q-factor
due to fluid damping decreases and, as a result, usually just the fundamental
resonant frequencies can be correctly identified. Moreover, for higher modes
the resonance coupling, noise and internal damping have been proven to strongly
affect the measured resonant frequencies and, correspondingly, the accuracy of
the estimated masses. Here, we derive the easy accessible expressions enabling
the quantitative mass(es) determination just from the fundamental resonant
frequencies of the micro/nanomechanical mass sensor under intentionally applied
axial tension, which can be easily created and controlled by the electrostatic
or magnetostatic forces. We also show that typically achievable force
resolution has a negligible impact on the mass determination and the mass

dynamics simulations, based on the distance between particles and the
interface, and presents a solution for detecting interfaces in real-time. Our
dynamic cutoff method (DCM) exhibits a linear-time complexity as well as nearly
ideal weak and strong scaling. The DCM is tailored for massively parallel
architectures and for large interfacial systems with millions of particles. We
implemented the DCM as part of the LAMMPS open-source molecular dynamics
package and demonstrate the nearly ideal weak- and strong-scaling behavior of
this method on an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer. Our results for a liquid/vapor
system consisting of Lennard-Jones particles show that the accuracy of DCM is
comparable to that of the traditional particle-particle particle- mesh (PPPM)
algorithm. The performance comparison indicates that DCM is preferable for
large systems due to the limited scaling of FFTs within the PPPM algorithm.
Moreover, the DCM requires the interface to be identified every other MD
timestep. As a consequence, this thesis also presents an interface detection
method which is (1) applicable in real time; (2) parallelizable; and (3) scales
linearly with respect to the number of particles.

contextuality is the Exclusivity principle, which states that the sum of the
probabilities of a set of pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. By itself,
the Exclusivity principle singles out the maximum quantum value for some
important Bell and noncontextuality inequalities. We can get better results if
we apply the E principle to more sophisticated scenarios. This happens because
this principle exhibits activation effects: a distribution satisfying this
principles does not necessarily satisfy it when combined with other
distributions. Activation effects can be used to prove that the Exclusivity
principle singles out the set of quantum distributions for the most simple
noncontextuality inequality. It is still not known if the exclusivity principle
solves the problem of explaining quantum contextuality completely, but many
results have been proven that support the conjecture that it might. The main
purpose of this thesis is to discuss in detail the situations in which the E
principle can be used to rule out distributions outside the quantum set.

role in image understanding. Recent approaches have attempted to harness the
capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle
pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the
limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To
solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network
that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To
this end, we formulate mean-field approximate inference for the Conditional
Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials as Recurrent Neural Networks.
This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a
deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly,
our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to
train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation
algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We
apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation,
obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation
benchmark.

Short version to appear at AAMAS-15",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) is an effective and popular technique
to speed up reinforcement learning by leveraging domain knowledge. While PBRS
is proven to always preserve optimal policies, its effect on learning speed is
determined by the quality of its potential function, which, in turn, depends on
both the underlying heuristic and the scale. Knowing which heuristic will prove
effective requires testing the options beforehand, and determining the
appropriate scale requires tuning, both of which introduce additional sample
complexity. We formulate a PBRS framework that reduces learning speed, but does
not incur extra sample complexity. For this, we propose to simultaneously learn
an ensemble of policies, shaped w.r.t. many heuristics and on a range of
scales. The target policy is then obtained by voting. The ensemble needs to be
able to efficiently and reliably learn off-policy: requirements fulfilled by
the recent Horde architecture, which we take as our basis. We demonstrate
empirically that (1) our ensemble policy outperforms both the base policy, and
its single-heuristic components, and (2) an ensemble over a general range of
scales performs at least as well as one with optimally tuned components.

in terms of the structure of D, for when a binary relation on its nodes is
definable by an expression in these algebras. Since each pair of nodes in such
a relation represents a unique path in D, our results therefore capture the
sets of paths in D definable in each of the fragments. We refer to this
perspective on language semantics as the ""global view."" In contrast with this
global view, there is also a ""local view"" where one is interested in the nodes
to which one can navigate starting from a particular node in the document. In
this view, we characterize when a set of nodes in D can be defined as the
result of applying an expression to a given node of D. All these definability
results, both in the global and the local view, are obtained by using a robust
two-step methodology, which consists of first characterizing when two nodes
cannot be distinguished by an expression in the respective fragments of XPath,

exponent depends on the large parameter. As an application we prove weak law of
large numbers and central limit theorem. The second result gives different
limiting distributions for two cases mentioned above. When the maximum of the
exponent is in the interior of the domain it is Normal distribution and if it
is on the boundary, it is Exponential in one direction of integration and
Normal in other directions.

the Calar Alto Fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph (CAFE). By simultaneously
modeling both datasets, we obtain the orbital and physical properties of the

($M_p=1.37^{+0.48}_{-0.46}~M_{\rm Jup}$), with an estimated radius of
$R_p=1.65^{+0.59}_{-0.56}~R_{\rm Jup}$ (uncertainties provided in this work are
$3\sigma$ unless specified). This translates into a sub-Jupiter density. The
planet revolves every $\sim7.8$ days in a slightly eccentric orbit
($e=0.123^{+0.037}_{-0.036}$) around a G8V star with detected activity in the
Kepler light curve. Kepler-447b transits its host with a large impact parameter
($b=1.076^{+0.112}_{-0.086}$), being one of the few planetary grazing transits
confirmed so far and the first in the Kepler large crop of exoplanets. We
estimate that only around 20% of the projected planet disk occults the stellar
disk. The relatively large uncertainties in the planet radius are due to the
large impact parameter and short duration of the transit. Planets with such an
extremely large impact parameter can be used to detect and analyze interesting
configurations such as additional perturbing bodies, stellar pulsations,
rotation of a non-spherical planet, or polar spot-crossing events. All these
scenarios would periodically modify the transit properties (depth, duration,
and time of mid-transit), what could be detectable with sufficient accurate
photometry. Short-cadence photometric data (at the 1 minute level) would help
in the search for these exotic configurations in grazing planetary transits
like that of Kepler-447b.

Often
giant planets are modeled under the assumption that they are adiabatic,
convective, and homogeneously mixed, but this is not necessarily correct. In
this work, we present the first self-consistent calculation of convective
transport of both heat and material as the planets evolve. We examine how
planetary evolution depends on the initial composition and its distribution,
whether the internal structure changes with time, and if so, how it affects the
evolution. We consider various primordial distributions, different
compositions, and different mixing efficiencies and follow the distribution of
heavy elements in a Jupiter-mass planet as it evolves. We show that a
heavy-element core cannot be eroded by convection if there is a sharp
compositional change at the core-envelope boundary. If the heavy elements are
initially distributed within the planet according to some compositional
gradient, mixing occurs in the outer regions resulting in a compositionally
homogeneous outer envelope. Mixing of heavy materials that are injected in a
convective gaseous envelope are found to mix efficiently. Our work demonstrates
that the primordial internal structure of a giant planet plays a substantial
role in determining its long-term evolution and that giant planets can have
non-adiabatic interiors. These results emphasize the importance of coupling
formation, evolution, and internal structure models of giant planets

interested in the features of the bi-partite entanglement entropy for this
model and on building blocks thereof, namely twist field form factors.
Non-unitarity selects out a new type of twist field as the operator whose
two-point function (appropriately normalized) yields the entanglement entropy.
We compute this two-point function both from a form factor expansion and by
means of perturbed conformal field theory. We find good agreement with CFT
predictions put forward in a recent work involving the present authors. In
particular, our results are consistent with a scaling of the entanglement
entropy given by $\frac{c_{\text{eff}}}{3}\log \ell$ where $c_{\text{eff}}$ is
the effective central charge of the theory (a positive number related to the
central charge) and $\ell$ is the size of the region. Furthermore the form
factor expansion of twist fields allows us to explore the large region limit of
the entanglement entropy and find the next-to-leading order correction to
saturation. We find that this correction is very different from its counterpart
in unitary models. Whereas in the latter case, it had a form depending only on
few parameters of the model (the particle spectrum), it appears to be much more
model-dependent for non-unitary models.

optimal control policy, which resembles the BP algorithm in basing resource
allocation and routing on a backpressure calculation, but differs from the BP

suggests a possible reason for the unsatisfactory delay performance of the BP

chemistry on grain surfaces in cold, dense molecular cores, saturating the
molecules present in ice mantles. Aims. We present a study of the low
temperature reactivity of solid phase isocyanic acid (HNCO) with hydrogen
atoms, with the aim of elucidating its reaction network. Methods. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry were employed to follow
the evolution of pure HNCO ice during bombardment with H atoms. Both multilayer
and monolayer regimes were investigated. Results. The hydrogenation of HNCO
does not produce detectable amounts of formamide (NH2CHO) as the major product.
Experiments using deuterium reveal that deuteration of solid HNCO occurs
rapidly, probably via cyclic reaction paths regenerating HNCO. Chemical
desorption during these reaction cycles leads to loss of HNCO from the surface.
Conclusions. It is unlikely that significant quantities of NH2CHO form from
HNCO. In dense regions, however, deuteration of HNCO will occur. HNCO and DNCO
will be introduced into the gas phase, even at low temperatures, as a result of

kinetic theory of Davidson et al. [Phys. Fluids 15, 317 (1972)] with a simple
description of current filament coalescence. It allows us to follow the
evolution of the ion parameters up to a stage close to complete isotropization,
and is thus of prime interest to understand the dynamics of collisionless shock
formation. Its predictions are supported by 2-D and 3-D particle-in-cell
simulations of the ion Weibel instability. The derived approximate analytical
solutions reveal the various dependencies of the ion relaxation to isotropy. In
particular, it is found that the influence of the electron screening can affect
the results of simulations using an unphysical electron mass.

events (TDEs) is that their temperatures are lower than expected and that the

be expected in standard disk theory. We show that this can be explained
qualitatively using an idea proposed by Laor & Davis in the context of normal
active galactic nuclei: that larger accretion rates imply stronger winds and
thus that the accretion rate through the inner disk only depends weakly on the
inflow rate at the outer edge of the disk. We also show that reasonable
quantitative agreement with data requires that, as has been suggested in recent
papers, the circularization radius of the tidal stream is approximately equal
to the semimajor axis of the most bound orbit of the debris rather than twice
the pericenter distance as would be expected without rapid angular momentum
redistribution. If this explanation is correct, it suggests that the evolution
of TDEs may test both non-standard disk theory and the details of the
interactions of the tidal stream.

These operators are an important step in the construction of the bialgebra

define the cup and cap operators associated with back-and-forth sequences and
add them to the creation and annihilation operators in the operator algebra as
they are required for the calculation of the full space of essential paths
prescribed by the fusion algebra. These operators require collapsed triangular
cells that had not been found in previous works; here we provide explicit
values for these cells and show their importance in order for the cell system
to fulfill the Kuperberg relations for $SU(3)$ tangles. We also find that
demanding that our operators satisfy the Temperley-Lieb algebra leads one
naturally to consider operators that create and annihilate closed triangular
sequences, which in turn provides an alternative the cup and cap operators as
they allow one to replace back-and-forth sequences with closed triangular ones.
We finally show that the essential paths obtained by using closed triangles are
equivalent to those obtained originally using back-and-forth sequences.

Bethe's hypothesis, i.e. a particular form of wave function introduced by Bethe
in solving the one-dimensional Heisenberg model in 1931. Despite the
Lieb-Liniger model is arguably the simplest exactly solvable model, it exhibits
rich quantum many-body physics in terms of the aspects of mathematical
integrability and physical universality. Moreover, the Yang-Yang grand
canonical ensemble description for the model provides us with a deep
understanding of quantum statistics, thermodynamics and quantum critical
phenomena at the many-body physics level. Recently, such fundamental physics of
this exactly solved model has been attracting growing interest in experiments.
Since 2004, there have been more than 20 experimental papers that report novel
observations of different physical aspects of the Lieb-Liniger model in the

with results obtained using the analysis of this simplest exactly solved model.

The modern availability of large databases of written text allows for tests
with an unprecedent statistical accuracy and also a characterization of the
fluctuations around the typical behavior. We find that fluctuations are usually
much larger than expected based on simplifying statistical assumptions (e.g.,
independence and lack of correlations between observations).These
simplifications appear also in usual statistical tests so that the large
fluctuations can be erroneously interpreted as a falsification of the law.
Instead, here we argue that linguistic laws are only meaningful (falsifiable)

classification of developing maps $f$ attached to solutions $u$ of the mean

respect to $\Lambda$ satisfied by $f$.
  We are especially interested in the case when the parameter $\rho$ in the

characterized by an approximate $d_{x^2-y^2}$ intra-unit cell form factor and a
finite modulation wavevector $\bq^\ast$. We study the effects impurities on
this charge ordered phase via a single-band model in which bond order is the
analogue of charge order in the cuprates. Impurities are assumed to be
pointlike and are treated within the self-consistent t-matrix approximation
(SCTMA). We show that suppression of bond order by impurities occurs through
the local disruption of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ form factor near individual
impurities. Unlike $d$-wave superconductors, where the sensitivity of $T_c$ to
impurities can be traced to a vanishing average of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order
parameter over the Fermi surface, the response of bond order to impurities is
dictated by a few Fermi surface ""hotspots"". The bond order transition
temperature $T_\mathrm{bo}$ thus follows a different universal dependence on
impurity concentration $n_i$ than does the superconducting $T_c$. In
particular, $T_\mathrm{bo}$ decreases more rapidly than $T_c$ with increasing
$n_i$ when there is a nonzero Fermi surface curvature at the hotspots. Based on
experimental evidence that the pseudogap is insensitive to Zn doping, we
conclude that a direct connection between charge order and the pseudogap is
unlikely. Furthermore, the enhancement of stripe correlations in the La-based
cuprates by Zn doping is evidence that this charge order is also distinct from
stripes.

essentially coincide with the so-called cluster expansion used by physicists.
In particular, the first term yields the celebrated (electric and elastic)

these formulas in the case of random inclusions.

ideal. The un-tempered glass foils were curved by means of an innovative hot
slumping technique and subsequently chemically tempered. In this paper we show
that the chemical tempering process applied to Gorilla glass foils does not
affect the surface micro-roughness of the mirrors. On the other end, the stress
introduced by the tempering process causes a reduction in the amplitude of the
longitudinal profile errors with a lateral size close to the mirror length. The
effect of the overall shape changes in the final resolution performance of the
glass mirrors was studied by simulating the glass foils integration with our
innovative approach based on glass reinforcing ribs. The preliminary tests

extensively studied in the theoretical computer science, machine learning and
the computational geometry communities. In this problem, we are given a set of
$n$ points in Euclidean space $R^d$, and the goal is to choose $k$ centers in
$R^d$ so that the sum of squared distances of each point to its nearest center
is minimized. The best approximation algorithms for this problem include a
polynomial time constant factor approximation for general $k$ and a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation which runs in time $poly(n) 2^{O(k/\epsilon)}$. At
the other extreme, the only known computational complexity result for this
problem is NP-hardness [ADHP'09]. The main difficulty in obtaining hardness
results stems from the Euclidean nature of the problem, and the fact that any
point in $R^d$ can be a potential center. This gap in understanding left open
the intriguing possibility that the problem might admit a PTAS for all $k,d$.
  In this paper we provide the first hardness of approximation for the
Euclidean $k$-means problem. Concretely, we show that there exists a constant
$\epsilon > 0$ such that it is NP-hard to approximate the $k$-means objective
to within a factor of $(1+\epsilon)$. We show this via an efficient reduction
from the vertex cover problem on triangle-free graphs: given a triangle-free
graph, the goal is to choose the fewest number of vertices which are incident
on all the edges. Additionally, we give a proof that the current best hardness
results for vertex cover can be carried over to triangle-free graphs. To show
this we transform $G$, a known hard vertex cover instance, by taking a graph
product with a suitably chosen graph $H$, and showing that the size of the
(normalized) maximum independent set is almost exactly preserved in the product
graph using a spectral analysis, which might be of independent interest.

Awerbuch, et.al., JACM 1990 that the distributed construction of a broadcast

precisions of above 90%. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis
approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around
70%~80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many
practical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level
sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level
and review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between
the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user
reviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a
basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not
necessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level
sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity
labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the
framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and
heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity.
Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our
framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a
significant improvement from current approaches.

rapidities, transverse momenta, and correlations in azimuthal angles between
the protons and between the charged Higgs bosons. As an example, the integrated
cross section for $\sqrt{s}$ = 14~TeV (LHC) is about 0.1~fb and about 0.9~fb at
the Future Circular Collider (FCC) for $\sqrt{s}$ = 100~TeV when assuming
$m_{H^{\pm}} = 150$~GeV. The results are compared with results obtained within
standard equivalent-photon approximation known from the literature. We discuss
the role of the Dirac and Pauli electromagnetic form factors of the proton. We
have also performed first calculations of cross sections for the exclusive
diffractive Khoze-Martin-Ryskin mechanism. We have estimated limits on the
$g_{h H^+ H^-}$ coupling constant within two-Higgs dublet model based on recent
experimental data from the LHC. The diffractive contribution is, however, much
smaller than the $\gamma \gamma$ one. The $Z \gamma$, $\gamma Z$, and $ZZ$
exchanges give even smaller contributions. Absorption corrections are
calculated for the first time differentially for various distributions. In
general, they lead to a damping of the cross section. The damping depends on
the $M_{H^{+}H^{-}}$ invariant mass and on $t$ four-momentum transfers squared.
In contrast to diffractive processes, the larger the collision energy, the
smaller the effect of absorption. We discuss a possibility to measure the
exclusive production of two charged Higgs bosons with the help of so-called
""forward proton detectors"" at the LHC experiments.

new code to analyse LiTE that also includes secular variation in the pulsation
period. Its usability was successfully tested on CL Aur, an eclipsing binary
with mass-transfer in a triple system that shows similar changes in the O-C
diagram. Since orbital motion would cause systematic shifts in mean RVs
(dominated by pulsations), we computed and compared our model with
centre-of-mass velocities. They were determined using high-quality templates of
RV curves of RRab stars. Maxima timings adopted from the GEOS database (168)
together with those newly determined from sky surveys and new measurements (85)
were used to construct an O-C diagram spanning almost five proposed orbital
cycles. This data set is three times larger than data sets used by previous
authors. Modelling of the O-C dependence resulted in 23.3-year orbital period,
which translates into a minimum mass of the second component of about 0.33 M_s.
Secular changes in the pulsation period of TU UMa over the whole O-C diagram
were satisfactorily approximated by a parabolic trend with a rate of -2.2

each other, leading to strong shocks and regions of enhanced density and
temperature. Potentially habitable circumbinary planets must continually be
exposed to these interactions regions.
  Aims. We study, for the first time, the interactions between winds from
low-mass stars in a binary system, to show the wind conditions seen by
potentially habitable circumbinary planets.
  Methods. We use the advanced 3D numerical hydrodynamic code Nurgush to model
the wind interactions of two identical winds from two solar mass stars with
circular orbits and a binary separation of 0.5 AU. As input into this model, we
use a 1D hydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind, run using the Versatile
Advection Code. We derive the locations of stable and habitable orbits in this
system to explore what wind conditions potentially habitable planets will be
exposed to during their orbits.
  Results. Our wind interaction simulations result in the formation of two
strong shock waves separated by a region of enhanced density and temperature.
The wind-wind interaction region has a spiral shape due to Coriolis forces
generated by the orbital motions of the two stars. The stable and habitable
zone in this system extends from approximately 1.4 AU to 2.4 AU. (TRUNCATED)

agents are competing for k non-identical indivisible goods, (n > k). In each
round the strategic agents declare how much they value receiving any of the
goods in the specific round. The agent declaring the highest valuation receives
the good with the highest value, the agent with the second highest valuation
receives the second highest valued good, etc. Hence we assume a decision
function that assigns goods to agents based on their valuations. The novelty of
the mechanism is that no payment scheme is required to achieve truthfulness in
a setting with rational/strategic agents. The FEDoR mechanism takes advantage
of the repeated nature of the framework, and through a statistical test is able
to punish the misreporting agents and be fair, truthful, and socially
efficient. FEDoR is fair in the sense that, in expectation over the course of
the rounds, all agents will receive the same good the same amount of times.
FEDoR is an eligible candidate for applications that require fair distribution
of resources over time. For example, equal share of bandwidth for nodes through
the same point of access. But further on, FEDoR can be applied in less trivial
settings like sponsored search, where payment is necessary and can be given in
the form of a flat participation fee. To this extent we perform a comparison

the Quad-redundant Flight Control System (QFCS) within NASA's Transport Class

that correspond to the requirements for software components embedded in an AADL
system architecture model. This approach is designed to exploit the
verification effort and artifacts that are already part of typical software
verification processes in the avionics domain. Our approach is supported by an
AADL annex that allows specification of contracts along with a tool, called
AGREE, for performing compositional verification. The goal of this paper is to
show the benefits of a compositional verification approach applied to a
realistic avionics system and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AGREE
tool in performing this analysis.

assessing the exposure of personal information in open settings. Our
formalization addresses key-challenges posed by such open settings, such as the
unstructured dissemination of heterogeneous information and the necessity of
user- and context-dependent privacy requirements. We propose a new definition
of information sensitivity derived from our formalization of privacy
requirements, and, as a sanity check, show that hard non-disclosure guarantees
are impossible to achieve in open settings.
  After that, we provide an instantiation of our framework to address the
identity disclosure problem, leading to the novel notion of d-convergence.
d-convergence is based on indistinguishability of entities and it bounds the
likelihood with which an adversary successfully links two profiles of the same
user across online communities.
  Finally, we provide a large-scale evaluation of our framework on a collection
of 15 million comments collected from the Online Social Network Reddit. Our
evaluation validates the notion of d-convergence for assessing the linkability
of entities in our data set and provides deeper insights into the data set's
structure.

of light in surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes by investigating both local
and global features in optical powerflow at SPP frequencies. Close inspection
of the instantaneous Poynting vector reveals formation of optical vortices -
localized areas of cyclic powerflow - at the metal-dielectric interface. As a
result, optical energy circulates through a subwavelength-thick 'conveyor belt'
between the metal and dielectric where it creates a high density of optical
states (DOS), tight optical energy localization, and low group velocity
associated with SPP waves. The formation of bonding and anti-bonding SPP modes
in metal-dielectric-metal waveguides can also be conveniently explained in
terms of different spatial arrangements of localized powerflow vortices between
two metal interfaces. Finally, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of
global topological transitions in metamaterials composed of multiple metal and
dielectric films, i.e., transitions of their iso-frequency surfaces from
ellipsoids to hyperboloids, which are not accompanied by the breaking of
lattice symmetry. Our analysis reveals that such global topological transitions
are governed by the dynamic local re-arrangement of local topological features
of the optical interference field, such as vortices and saddle points, which
reconfigures global optical powerflow within the metamaterial. These new
insights into plasmonic light localization and DOS manipulation not only help
to explain the well-known properties of SPP waves but also provide useful
guidelines for the design of plasmonic components and materials for a variety
of practical applications.

elements can be classified as elemental abundance, isotopic abundance, and
abundance of nuclei. In this work we propose to change nucleon identification
from the usual (Z,A) to (Z,N), which allows reading out new information from
the measured abundances. We are interested in the neutron density required to
reproduce the measured abundance of nuclei assuming equilibrium processes. This
is only possible when two stable nuclei are separated by an unstable nucleus.
At these places we investigated the neutron density required for equilibrium
nucleosynthesis both isotopically and isotonically at temperatures of AGB
interpulse and thermal pulse phases. We obtained an estimate for equilibrium
nucleosynthesis neutron density in most of the cases. Next we investigated the
possibility of partial formation of nuclei. We analyzed the meaning of the
branching factor. We found a mathematical definition for the unified
interpretation of a branching point closed at isotonic case and open at
isotopic case. We introduce a more expressive variant of branching ratio called
partial formation rate. With these we are capable of determining the
characteristic neutron density values.

expression of a non-dimensional number $\gamma$ which controls the transition
behavior. We prove that depending on $\gamma$, the modeled flow exhibits either
a continuous (Type I) or catastrophic (Type II) transition. Numerical
evaluation of $\gamma$ for a physically realistic region of parameter space
suggest that a catastrophic transition is preferred in this flow.

DoA estimation schemes using a sensor array in the case where the number of
observations $N$ is significantly smaller than the number of sensors $M$, and
that the smoothing parameter $L$ is such that $M$ and $NL$ are of the same
order of magnitude. This context is modelled by an asymptotic regime in which
$NL$ and $M$ both converge towards $\infty$ at the same rate. As in recent
works devoted to the study of (unsmoothed) subspace methods in the case where
$M$ and $N$ are of the same order of magnitude, it is shown that it is still
possible to derive improved DoA estimators termed as Generalized-MUSIC with
spatial smoothing (G-MUSIC SS). The key ingredient of this work is a technical
result showing that the largest singular values and corresponding singular
vectors of low rank deterministic perturbation of certain Gaussian block-Hankel
large random matrices behave as if the entries of the latter random matrices
were independent identically distributed. This allows to conclude that when the
number of sources and their DoA do not scale with $M,N,L,$ a situation
modelling widely spaced DoA scenarios, then both traditional and Generalized
spatial smoothing subspace methods provide consistent DoA estimators whose
convergence speed is faster than $\frac{1}{M}$. The case of DoA that are spaced
of the order of a beamwidth, which models closely spaced sources, is also
considered. It is shown that the convergence speed of G-MUSIC SS estimates is
unchanged, but that it is no longer the case for MUSIC SS ones.

diverse applications. They are naturally induced in modeling secure sensor
networks under random key predistribution schemes, as well as in modeling the
topologies of social networks including common-interest networks, collaboration
networks, and actor networks. Simply put, a random intersection graph is
constructed by assigning each node a set of items in some random manner and
then putting an edge between any two nodes that share a certain number of
items.
  Broadly speaking, our work is about analyzing random intersection graphs, and
models generated by composing it with other random graph models including
random geometric graphs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. These compositional
models are introduced to capture the characteristics of various complex natural
or man-made networks more accurately than the existing models in the
literature. For random intersection graphs and their compositions with other
random graphs, we study properties such as ($k$-)connectivity,
($k$-)robustness, and containment of perfect matchings and Hamilton cycles. Our
results are typically given in the form of asymptotically exact probabilities
or zero-one laws specifying critical scalings, and provide key insights into
the design and analysis of various real-world networks.
