strongly correlated many-body classical system can show a paradoxical behavior,
namely asymptotic stochastic independence. We consider a triangular array such
that each row is a list of $n$ strongly correlated random variables. The
correlations are preserved even when $n\to\infty$, since the standard central
limit theorem does not hold for this array. We show that, if we choose a fixed
number $m<n$ of random variables of the $n$th row and trace over the other
$n-m$ variables, and then consider $n\to\infty$, the $m$ chosen ones can,
paradoxically, turn out to be independent. However, the scenario can be
different if $m$ increases with $n$. Finally, we suggest a possible
experimental verification of our results near criticality of a second-order
phase transition.

of smart grids need to deal with is to forecast the fluctuations of power
demand and generation in order to make the power system facilities more
flexible to the variable nature of renewable power resources and demand-side.
This paper proposes a novel two-tier scheme for forecasting the power demand
and generation in a general residential electrical gird which uses the
distributed renewable resources as the primary energy resource. The proposed
forecasting scheme has two tiers: long-term demand/generation forecaster which
is based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and real-time demand/generation
forecaster which is based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA)
model. The paper also shows that how bulk generation improves the adequacy of
proposed residential system by canceling-out the forecasters estimation errors
which are in the form of Gaussian White noises.

the Grand Canonical ensemble. In general a chosen thermodynamic potential
(e.g., free energy) is different in the two cases. Their relationship is
considered here as a function of the system size. Exact expressions relating
the fundamental potential for each (free energy and pressure, respectively) are
identified for arbitrary system size. A formal asymptotic analysis for large
system size gives the expected equivalence, but without any characterization of
the intermediate size dependence. More detailed evaluation is provided for the
simple case of a homogeneous, non-interacting Fermi gas. In this case, the
origin of size dependence arises from only two length scales, the average
inter-particle distance and quantum length scale (thermal deBroglie or Fermi
length). The free energies per particle calculated from each ensemble are
compared for particle numbers $2\le N\le 64$ for a range of temperatures above

applications of density functional theory is discussed briefly.

science. Quantum tomography, the standard tool used for this purpose, uses a
well-designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes.
It is, however, notoriously inefficient. Recently, the classical signal
reconstruction technique known as ""compressed sensing"" has been ported to
quantum information science to overcome this challenge: accurate tomography can
be achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings, thereby greatly
enhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography. Here we show that compressed
sensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special
property of quantum mechanics itself---that the mathematical objects that
describe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with nonnegative
eigenvalues. This result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is
understood and implemented. In particular, it implies that the information
obtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a
new sense of ""informational completeness."" This has important consequences on
the efficiency of data taking for quantum tomography, and enables us to
construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and
modeling errors. Moreover, our result shows that one can expand the numerical
tool-box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms
developed to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional Hilbert
space. While we mainly present our results in the context of quantum
tomography, they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix
recovery.

transverse momentum are analysed in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 0.9, 2.76 and 7
TeV, and Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV as a function of the
charged-particle multiplicity. In both systems, dynamical fluctuations beyond
the statistical expectation are observed. In pp collisions, no significant
dependence on collision energy is found, even in comparison to inclusive
results at much lower collision energies. Likewise, central A-A collisions show
only little dependence on collision energy. The multiplicity dependence
observed in peripheral Pb-Pb data is in agreement with that in pp collisions.
Going to more central Pb-Pb collisions, a clear deviation from this trend is
found, reaching a significant reduction of the fluctuations in most central

pp, but rather large differences in Pb-Pb collisions.

than the one followed in most of the previous analyses, where this process was

the $hh \to b\bar b\gamma\gamma$ channel and perform a thorough simulation of
signal and background at the 14 TeV LHC and a future 100 TeV proton-proton
collider. We make use of invariant mass distributions to enhance the
sensitivity on the EFT coefficients and give a first assessment of the impact
of jet substructure techniques on the results. The range of validity of the EFT
description is estimated, as required to consistently exploit the high-energy
range of distributions, pointing out the potential relevance of dimension-8
operators. Our analysis contains a few important improvements over previous
studies and identifies some inaccuracies there appearing in connection with the
estimate of signal and background rates. The estimated precision on the Higgs
trilinear coupling that follows from our results is less optimistic than
previously claimed in the literature. We find that a ~30% accuracy can be
reached on the trilinear coupling at a future 100 TeV collider with 3 ab^-1.
Only an O(1) determination seems instead possible at the LHC with the same
amount of integrated luminosity.

coefficient measurements on co-sputtered nanocrystalline SmB6 films and try to
find possible signatures of their topological properties. The magnetoresistance
(MR) at 2 K is positive and linear (LPMR) at low field and becomes negative and
quadratic at higher field. While the negative part is known from the reduction
of the hybridization gap due to Zeeman splitting, the positive dependence is
similar to what has been observed in other topological insulators (TI). We
conclude that the LPMR is a characteristic feature of TI and is related to the
linear dispersion near the Dirac cone. The Hall resistance shows a sign change
around 50 K. It peaks and becomes nonlinear at around 10 K then decreases below
10 K. This indicates that carriers with opposite signs emerge below 50 K. Two
films with different geometries (thickness and lateral dimension) show
contrasting behavior below and above 50K, which proves the surface origin of
the low temperature carriers in these films. The temperature dependence of
magnetoresistance and the Hall data indicates that the surface states are
likely non-trivial.

fields rolls slowly during inflation whereas the other field is trapped in a
meta-stable vacuum. The nucleation rate from the false vacuum to the true one
becomes substantial enough that triggers a first order phase transition and
ends inflation. We revisit the question of first order phase transition in an
""extended"" model of hybrid inflation, realizing the double-field inflationary
scenario, and correctly identify the parameter space that leads to a first
order phase transition at the end of inflation. We compute the gravitational
wave profile which is generated during this first order phase transition.
Assuming instant reheating, the peak frequency falls in the $1$ GHz to $10$ GHz
frequency band and the amplitude varies in the range $10^{-11}\lesssim
\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2 \lesssim 10^{-8}$, depending on the value of the
cosmological constant in the false vacuum. The signature could be observed by
the planned Chongqing high frequency gravitational probe. For a narrow band of
vacuum energies, the first order phase transition can happen after the end of
inflation via the violation of slow-roll, with a peak frequency that varies
from $1$ THz to $100$ THz. For smaller values of cosmological constant, even
though inflation can end via slow-roll violation, the universe gets trapped in
a false vacuum whose energy drives a second phase of eternal inflation. This
range of vacuum energies do not lead to viable inflationary models, unless the
value of the cosmological constant is compatible with the observed value,
$M\sim 10^{-3}$ eV.

modular forms from the perspective of physics and mathematics. The first part
is concerned with (refined) topological string theory and the direct
integration of the holomorphic anomaly equations. Here, a central object to
compute higher genus amplitudes, which serve as the generating functions of
various enumerative invariants, is provided by the so-called propagator. We
derive a universal expression for the propagator for geometries that have
mirror curves of genus two which is given by the derivative of the logarithm of
Igusa's cusp form of weight 10. In addition, we illustrate our findings by
solving the refined topological string on the resolutions of the three toric
orbifolds of order three, five and six.
  In the second part, we give explicit expressions for lowering and raising
operators on Siegel modular forms, and define almost holomorphic Siegel modular
forms based on them. Extending the theory of Fourier-Jacobi expansions to
almost holomorphic Siegel modular forms and building up on recent work by
Pitale, Saha, and Schmidt, we can show that there is no analogue of the almost
holomorphic elliptic second Eisenstein series. In the case of genus 2, we
provide an almost meromorphic substitute for it. This, in particular, leads us
to a generalization of Ramanujan's differential equation for the second
Eisenstein series.
  The two parts are intertwined by the observation that the meromorphic
analogue of the almost holomorphic second Eisenstein series coincides with the
physical propagator. In addition, the generalized Ramanujan identities match
precisely the physical consistency conditions that need to be imposed on the
propagator.

unpredictable behavior in mixtures of solvents. One such phenomenon is
co-non-solvency. Co-non-solvency occurs when two (perfectly) miscible and
competing good solvents, for a given polymer, are mixed together. As a result,
the same polymer collapses into a compact globule within intermediate mixing
ratios. More interestingly, polymer collapses when the solvent quality remains
good and even gets increasingly better by the addition of the better cosolvent.
This is a puzzling phenomenon that is driven by strong local concentration
fluctuations. Because of the discrete particle based nature of the
interactions, Flory-Huggins type mean field arguments become unsuitable. In
this work, we extend the analysis of the co-non-solvency effect presented
earlier [Nature Communications 5, 4882 (2014)]. We explain why co-non-solvency
is a generic phenomenon that can be understood by the thermodynamic treatment
of the competitive displacement of (co)solvent components. This competition can
result in a polymer collapse upon improvement of the solvent quality. Specific
chemical details are not required to understand these complex conformational
transitions. Therefore, a broad range of polymers are expected to exhibit
similar reentrant coil-globule-coil transitions in competing good solvents.

large droplets, and a broad range of smaller droplets. The size distribution of
the latter follows a scaling law characterized by a non-trivial polydispersity
exponent. We present here a numerical model for three-dimensional droplets on a
one-dimensional substrate (fiber) that accounts for droplet nucleation, growth
and merging. The polydispersity exponent retrieved using this model is not
universal. Rather it depends on the thickness of the fiber and on details of
the droplet interaction leading to merging. In addition, its values
consistently differ from the theoretical prediction by Blackman (Phys. Rev.
Lett., 2000). Possible causes of this discrepancy are pointed out.

at near-infrared compared to optical wavelengths -- the effect of dust
extinction is expected to be lower and it has been shown that SNe Ia behave
more like `standard candles' at NIR wavelengths. To better understand the
physical processes behind this increased uniformity, we have studied the $Y$,
$J$ and $H$-filter light curves of 91 SNe Ia from the literature. We show that
the phases and luminosities of the first maximum in the NIR light curves are
extremely uniform for our sample. The phase of the second maximum, the
late-phase NIR luminosity and the optical light curve shape are found to be
strongly correlated, in particular more luminous SNe Ia reach the second
maximum in the NIR filters at a later phase compared to fainter objects. We
also find a strong correlation between the phase of the second maximum and the
epoch at which the SN enters the Lira law phase in its optical colour curve
(epochs $\sim$ 15 to 30 days after $B$ band maximum). The decline rate after
the second maximum is very uniform in all NIR filters. We suggest that these
observational parameters are linked to the nickel and iron mass in the
explosion, providing evidence that the amount of nickel synthesised in the
explosion is the dominating factor shaping the optical and NIR appearance of
SNe Ia.

included porosity, tortuosity, specific surface area, particle and pore size

varying extent of effect on the elastic properties simulated from the

renormalization group (SRG) evolved potential matrix elements to a universal
form, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into universality for
three-nucleon forces. In agreement with observations made previously for
Lee-Suzuki transformations, regions of universal potential matrix elements are
restricted to where half-on-shell T-matrix equivalence holds, but the
potentials must also reproduce binding energies. We find universality in local
energy regions, reflecting a local decoupling by the SRG. To continue the study
in the 3-body sector, we create a simple 1-D spinless boson ""theoretical
laboratory"" for a dramatic improvement in computational efficiency. We
introduce a basis-transformation, harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, which is used
for current many-body calculations and discuss the imposed truncations. When
SRG evolving in a HO-basis, we show that the evolved matrix elements, once
transformed back into momentum-representation, differ from those when evolving
with momentum representation. This is because the generator in each basis is
not exactly the same due to the truncation, which creates evolution artifacts
in the 3-body potential matrix elements. In the 2- body sector, this can be
avoided by increasing the basis size, but it remains unclear whether this is

more difficult to avoid, and the computational power required is greatly
increased for three-body evolution.

how the site displays information, how users navigate it to find items of
interest, users' tastes, and the `virality' of information, i.e., its
propensity to be adopted, or retweeted, upon exposure. Probabilistic models can
learn users' tastes from the history of their item adoptions and recommend new
items to users. However, current models ignore cognitive biases that are known
to affect behavior. Specifically, people pay more attention to items at the top
of a list than those in lower positions. As a consequence, items near the top
of a user's social media stream have higher visibility, and are more likely to
be seen and adopted, than those appearing below. Another bias is due to the
item's fitness: some items have a high propensity to spread upon exposure
regardless of the interests of adopting users. We propose a probabilistic model
that incorporates human cognitive biases and personal relevance in the
generative model of information spread. We use the model to predict how
messages containing URLs spread on Twitter. Our work shows that models of user
behavior that account for cognitive factors can better describe and predict
user behavior in social media.

secondary users can maximize their achievable transmission rate in this

the expected width of these lines is about 1000 km/s. No signs of these lines
can be traced in any of the two supernovae. When systematic uncertainties are
included, the limits on hydrogen-rich ablated gas in SNe 2011fe and 2014J are
0.003 M_sun and 0.0085 M_sun, respectively, where the limit for SN 2014J is the
second lowest ever, and the limit for SN 2011fe is a revision of a previous
limit. Limits are also put on helium-rich ablated gas. These limits are used,
in conjunction with other data, to argue that these supernovae can stem from
double-degenerate systems, or from single-degenerate systems with a spun
up/spun down super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. For SN 2011fe, other types of
hydrogen-rich donors can likely be ruled out, whereas for SN 2014J a
main-sequence donor system with large intrinsic separation is still possible.
Helium-rich donor systems cannot be ruled out for any of the two supernovae,
but the expected short delay time for such progenitors makes this possibility
less likely, especially for SN 2011fe. The broad [Ni II] 7378 emission in SN
2014J is redshifted by about +1300 km/s, as opposed to the known blueshift of
roughly -1100 km/s for SN 2011fe. [Fe II] 7155 is also redshifted in SN 2014J.
SN 2014J belongs to a minority of SNe Ia that both have a nebular redshift of
[Fe II] 7155 and [Ni II] 7378, and a slow decline of the Si II 6355 absorption
trough just after B-band maximum.

(MoS2) have recently attracted remarkable attention because of their unique
physical properties. Here, we use photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy
to study the formation of the so- called trions in a synthesized freestanding
trilayer MoS2. A trion is a charged quasi-particle formed by adding one
electron or hole to a neutral exciton (a bound electron-hole pair). We
demonstrate accurate control over the transformation of excitons to trions by
tuning the power of the optical pump (laser). Increasing the power of the
excitation laser beyond a certain threshold (~ 4 mW) allows modulation of
trion-to-exciton PL intensity ratio as well as the spectral linewidth of both
trions and excitons. Via a systematic and complementary Raman analysis we
disclose a strong coupling between laser induced exciton-to-trion
transformation and the characteristic phononic vibrations of MoS2. The onset of
such an optical transformation corresponds to the onset of a previously unknown
nonlinear Raman shift of the in-plane (E12g) and out-of-plane (A1g) vibrational
modes. This coupling directly affects the well-known linear red-shift of the
A1g and E12g vibrations due to heating at low laser powers, and changes it to a
nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence with a blue-shift in the high laser
power regime. Local reduction of the electron density upon exciton-to-trion
transformation is found to be the underlying mechanism for the blue-shift at
high laser powers. Our findings enrich our knowledge about the strong coupling
of photonic and phononic properties in 2D semiconductors, and enable reliable
interpretation of PL and Raman spectra in the high laser power regimes.

arise from beam imperfections. We present a heuristic classification of beam
imperfections according to their symmetries and uniformities, and discuss how
resulting contamination adds or cancels in maps that combine observations made
at multiple orientations of the telescope about its boresight axis. We
introduce a technique, which we call ""deprojection"", for filtering the leading
order beam-induced contamination from time ordered data, and show that it
removes power from BICEP2's $BB$ spectrum consistent with predictions using
high signal-to-noise beam shape measurements. We detail the simulation pipeline
that we use to directly simulate instrumental systematics and the calibration
data used as input to that pipeline. Finally, we present the constraints on
$BB$ contamination from individual sources of potential systematics. We find
that systematics contribute $BB$ power that is a factor $\sim10\times$ below
BICEP2's 3-year statistical uncertainty, and negligible compared to the
observed $BB$ signal. The contribution to the best-fit tensor/scalar ratio is
at a level equivalent to $r=(3-6)\times10^{-3}$.

We consider optimization with respect to both objectives at once, thus unifying

optimization with respect to strategies that are risk-averse (i.e., ensure
certain probabilistic guarantee). Our main results are as follows: First, we
present algorithms for the decision problems which are always polynomial in the

has observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353
GHz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$K deg in $Q$ and $U$ at
143 GHz). We detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $B$-modes at high
significance. We fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra at
frequencies $\geq 150$ GHz to a lensed-$\Lambda$CDM model that includes dust
and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (as
parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on the
frequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\
analysis of other regions of the sky. We find strong evidence for dust and no
statistically significant evidence for tensor modes. We probe various model
variations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component in
combination with lower frequency data, and find that these make little
difference to the $r$ constraint. Finally we present an alternative analysis
which is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and show
that this gives similar constraints. The final result is expressed as a
likelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}<0.12$ at 95%
confidence. Marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $B$-modes are detected at
$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

by Galley, Behunin and Hu [Phys. Rev. A 87, 043832 (2013)], to describe the
quantum entanglement between a mirror's center of mass (CoM) motion and a
field. In contrast with the conventional approach where the mirror-field
entanglement is understood as arising from the radiation pressure of an optical
field inducing the motion of the mirror's CoM, the MOF model incorporates the
dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror that couple to the
optical field directly. The major advantage in this approach is that it
provides a self-consistent treatment of the three pertinent subsystems (the
mirror's CoM motion, its internal degrees of freedom and the field) including
their back-actions on each other, thereby giving a more accurate account of the
quantum correlations between the individual subsystems. The optical and the
mechanical properties of a mirror arising from its dynamical interaction with a
quantum field are obtained without imposing any boundary conditions on the
field additionally, as is done in the conventional way. As one of the new
physical features that arise from this self-consistent treatment of the coupled
optics and mechanics behavior we observe a coherent transfer of quantum
correlations from the field to the mirror via its internal degrees of freedom.
We find the quantum entanglement between the optical field and the mirror's
center of mass motion upon coarse-graining over the internal degree of freedom.
Further, we show that in certain parameter regimes the mirror-field
entanglement is enhanced when the field interacts resonantly with the mirror's
internal degree of freedom, a new result which highlights the importance of
including the internal structure of the mirror in quantum optomechanical
studies.

Our detector arrays repeatedly produce spectral bands with 20%-30% bandwidth at
95, 150, or 220~GHz. The integrated antenna arrays synthesize symmetric
co-aligned beams with controlled side-lobe levels. Cross-polarized response on
boresight is typically ~0.5%, consistent with cross-talk in our multiplexed
readout system. End-to-end optical efficiencies in our cameras are routinely
35% or higher, with per detector sensitivities of NET~300 uKrts. Thanks to the
scalability of this design, we have deployed 2560 detectors as 1280 matched
pairs in Keck Array with a combined instantaneous sensitivity of ~9 uKrts, as
measured directly from CMB maps in the 2013 season. Similar arrays have
recently flown in the SPIDER instrument, and development of this technology is

in the no-boundary quantum state. In this context, universes can be
characterised as classical (in a WKB sense) when the wavefunction is highly
oscillatory, i.e. when the ratio of the change in the amplitude of the
wavefunction becomes small compared to the change in the phase. In the presence
of a positive or negative exponential potential, the WKB condition is satisfied
in proportion to a factor $e^{-(\epsilon - 3)N/(\epsilon -1)},$ where
$\epsilon$ is the (constant) slow-roll/fast-roll parameter and $N$ designates
the number of e-folds. Thus classicality is reached exponentially fast in $N$,
but only when $\epsilon < 1$ (inflation) or $\epsilon > 3$ (ekpyrosis).
Furthermore, when the potential switches off and the ekpyrotic phase goes over
into a phase of kinetic domination, the level of classicality obtained up to
that point is preserved. Similar results are obtained in a cyclic potential,
where a dark energy plateau is added. Finally, for a potential of the form
$-\phi^n$ (with $n=4,6,8$), where the classical solution becomes increasingly
kinetic-dominated, there is an initial burst of classicalisation which then
quickly levels off. These results demonstrate that inflation and ekpyrosis,
which are the only dynamical mechanisms known for smoothing the universe, share
the perhaps even more fundamental property of rendering space and time
classical in the first place.

corrected for the contribution of the NIR bands using data available in the

goal of the HET Massive Galaxy Survey (HETMGS) is to find nearby galaxies that
are suitable for black hole mass measurements. In order to measure accurately
the black hole mass, one should kinematically resolve the region where the
black hole dominates the gravitational potential. For most galaxies, this
region is much less than an arcsecond. Thus, black hole masses are best
measured in nearby galaxies with telescopes that obtain high-spatial
resolution. The HETMGS focuses on those galaxies predicted to have the largest
sphere-of-influence, based on published stellar velocity dispersions or the
galaxy fundamental plane. To ensure coverage over galaxy types, the survey
targets those galaxies across a face-on projection of the fundamental plane. We
present the sample selection and resulting data products from the long-slit
observations, including central stellar kinematics and emission line ratios.
The full dataset, including spectra and resolved kinematics, is available
online. Additionally, we show that the current crop of black hole masses are
highly biased towards dense galaxies and that especially large disks and low
dispersion galaxies are under-represented. This survey provides the necessary
groundwork for future systematic black hole mass measurement campaigns.

accuracy and robustness to be 1.84 +- 0.07 x10^10 Msun. The stellar mass in

ratios in the bulge and compare them to theoretical predictions from population
synthesis models. We find a mass-to-light ratio in the K-band in the range
0.8-1.1. The models are consistent with a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF, but a
Salpeter IMF is ruled out for stellar ages of 10 Gyr. To match predictions from

about 40% or 0.7 x10^10 Msun dark matter in the bulge region. The BRAVA data

rotators (R >= 1.5). Finally, we show that the Milky Way's B/P bulge has an

galaxies. We show that although the two progenitor galaxies are initially
following a prograde orbit, strong reactive forces during the merger can cause
a short-lived change of their orbital spin; the two progenitors follow a
retrograde orbit right before their final coalescence. This results in a
central kinematic decoupling and the formation of a large-scale (~2 kpc radius)
counter-rotating core (CRC) at the center of the final elliptical-like merger
remnant (M*=1.3x10^11 Msun), while its outer parts keep the rotation direction
of the initial orbital spin. The stellar velocity dispersion distribution of
the merger remnant galaxy exhibits two symmetrical off-centered peaks,
comparable to the observed ""2-sigma galaxies"". The KDC/CRC consists mainly of
old, pre-merger population stars (older than 5 Gyr), remaining prominent in the
center of the galaxy for more than 2 Gyr after the coalescence of its
progenitors. Its properties are consistent with KDCs observed in massive
elliptical galaxies. This new channel for the formation of KDCs from prograde
mergers is in addition to previously known formation scenarios from retrograde
mergers and can help towards explaining the substantial fraction of KDCs
observed in early-type galaxies.

with symmetry: $\dot\sigma^4$, $\dot\sigma^2 (\partial\sigma^2)$, and
$(\partial\sigma)^4$. In single field inflation, only the first of these
operators can be the leading non-Gaussian signal. A Fisher matrix analysis
shows that there is one near-degeneracy among the three CMB trispectra, so we
parameterize the trispectrum with two coefficients $g_{NL}^{\dot\sigma^4}$ and
$g_{NL}^{(\partial\sigma)^4}$, in addition to the coefficient $g_{NL}^{\rm

We next turn to data analysis and show how to represent these trispectra in a
factorizable form which leads to computationally fast operations such as
evaluating a CMB estimator or simulating a non-Gaussian CMB. We discuss
practical issues in CMB analysis pipelines, and perform an optimal analysis of

leading order in the gradient expansion are agnostic of the second law. While
this completes a transport taxonomy, we go on to argue for a new symmetry
principle, an Abelian gauge invariance that guarantees adiabaticity in
hydrodynamics. We suggest that this symmetry is the macroscopic manifestation
of the microscopic KMS invariance. We demonstrate its utility by explicitly
constructing effective actions for adiabatic transport. The theory of adiabatic
fluids, we speculate, provides a useful starting point for a new framework to
describe non-equilibrium dynamics, wherein dissipative effects arise by
Higgsing the Abelian symmetry.

2014) have generated concern over the intensity and spectrum of ionizing
photons in the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB). The balance of
hydrogen photoionization and recombination determines the opacity of the
low-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM). We calibrate the hydrogen
photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{\rm H}$) by comparing {\it Hubble Space
Telescope} spectroscopic surveys of the low-redshift column density
distribution of \HI\ absorbers and the observed ($z < 0.4$) mean \Lya\ flux
decrement, $D_A = (0.014)(1+z)^{2.2}$, to new cosmological simulations. The
distribution, $f(N_{\rm HI}, z) \equiv d^2 {\cal N} / d(\log N_{\rm HI}) dz$,
is consistent with an increased UVB that includes contributions from both
quasars and galaxies. Our recommended fit, $\Gamma_{\rm H}(z) = (4.6 \times
10^{-14}$ s$^{-1})(1+z)^{4.4}$ for $0 < z < 0.47$, corresponds to
unidirectional LyC photon flux $\Phi_0 \approx 5700$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ at $z =
0$. This flux agrees with observed IGM metal ionization ratios (\CIII/\CIV\ and
\SiIII/\SiIV) and suggests a 25-30\% contribution of \Lya\ absorbers to the
cosmic baryon inventory. The primary uncertainties in the low-redshift UVB are
the contribution from massive stars in galaxies and the LyC escape fraction
($f_{\rm esc}$), a highly directional quantity that is difficult to constrain
statistically. We suggest that both quasars and low-mass starburst galaxies are
important contributors to the ionizing UVB at $z < 2$. Their additional
ionizing flux would resolve any crisis in photon underproduction.

in northern Chile. The camera provides a field of view of 5'.1 $\times$ 5'.1

2.4 $\mu$m. Taking advantage of the dry site, the camera is capable of hydrogen
Paschen-$\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$, $\lambda=$1.8751 $\mu$m in air) narrow-band
imaging observations, at which wavelength ground-based observations have been
quite difficult due to deep atmospheric absorption mainly from water vapor. We
have been successfully obtaining Pa$\alpha$ images of Galactic objects and
nearby galaxies since the first-light observation in 2009 with ANIR. The
throughputs at the narrow-band filters ($N1875$, $N191$) including the
atmospheric absorption show larger dispersion (~10%) than those at broad-band
filters (a few %), indicating that they are affected by temporal fluctuations
in Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) above the site. We evaluate the PWV content
via the atmospheric transmittance at the narrow-band filters, and derive that
the median and the dispersion of the distribution of the PWV are 0.40+/-0.30 mm
for $N1875$ and 0.37+/-0.21 mm for $N191$, which are remarkably smaller
(49+/-38% for $N1875$ and 59+/-26% for $N191$) than radiometry measurements at
the base of Cerro Chajnantor (5100 m alt.). The decrease in PWV can be
explained by the altitude of the site when we assume that the vertical
distribution of the water vapor is approximated at an exponential profile with
scale heights within 0.3-1.9 km (previously observed values at night). We thus
conclude that miniTAO/ANIR at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor indeed provides us
an excellent capability for a ""ground-based"" Pa$\alpha$ observation.

requiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with the

12.9${\rm Jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. Moreover, the flattening of the integrated
number counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close to
the CIB intensity. Our data imply that galaxies with SFR$<40~M_{\odot}/yr$
certainly contribute less than 50% to the CIB while more than 50% of the CIB
must be produced by galaxies with $\rm SFR>40~M_{\odot}/yr$. The differential
number counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models of
galaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. Consequently, this supports
the galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

mixed-morphology remnant 3C400.2. We analysed spectra of different parts of the
remnant to observe if the plasma properties provide hints on the origin of the
mixed-morphology class. These remnants often show overionization, which is a
sign of rapid cooling of the thermal plasma, and super-solar abundances of
elements which is a sign of ejecta emission. Our analysis shows that the
thermal emission of 3C400.2 can be well explained by a two component
non-equilibrium ionization model, of which one component is underionized, has a
high temperature ($kT \approx 3.9$ keV) and super-solar abundances, while the
other component has a much lower temperature ($kT \approx 0.14$ keV), solar
abundances and shows signs of overionization. The temperature structure,
abundance values and density contrast between the different model components
suggest that the hot component comes from ejecta plasma, while the cooler
component has an interstellar matter origin. This seems to be the first
instance of an overionized plasma found in the outer regions of a supernova
remnant, whereas the ejecta component of the inner region is underionized. In
addition, the non-ionization equilibrium plasma component associated with the
ejecta is confined to the central, brighter parts of the remnant, whereas the
cooler component is present mostly in the outer regions. Therefore our data can
most naturally be explained by an evolutionary scenario in which the outer
parts of the remnant are cooling rapidly due to having swept up high density
ISM, while the inner parts are very hot and cooling inefficiently due to low
density of the plasma. This is also known as the relic X-ray scenario.

GRB, with an associated supernova and with a blackbody component detected in
the early afterglow observed by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT). Here we show
that the prompt gamma-ray emission has a blackbody spectrum, making this the
second such burst observed by Fermi GBM. The properties of the blackbody,
together with the redshift and our estimate of the radiative efficiency, makes
it possible to calculate the absolute values of the properties of the outflow.
We obtain an initial Lorentz factor Gamma=138\pm 8, a photospheric radius
r_phot=4.4\pm 1.9 \times 10^{11} cm and a launch radius r_0=2.7\pm 1.6 \times

jet has a relatively unobstructed path through the star. There is no smooth
connection between the blackbody components seen by GBM and XRT, ruling out the
scenario that the late emission is due to high-latitude effects. In the
interpretation that the XRT blackbody is prompt emission due to late central
engine activity, the jet either has to be very wide or have a clumpy structure
where the emission originates from a small patch. Other explanations for this

flows in prominences and prominence mass. Measuring these quantities is
essential to development and testing of models discussed throughout this book.
Prominence flows are complex and various, ranging from the relatively linear
flows along prominence spines to the complex, turbulent patterns exhibited by
hedgerow prominences. Techniques for measuring flows include time slice and
optical flow techniques used for motions in the plane of the sky and the use of
spectral line profiles to determine Doppler velocities along the line of sight.
Prominence mass measurement is chiefly done via continuum absorption
measurements, but mass has also been estimated using cloud modeling and white
light measurements.

layer. Within the extent of these fragmented current regions the associated
magnetic flux transfer and energy release occurs simultaneously in many
different places. This investigation focusses on how best to quantify the rate
at which reconnection occurs in such layers. An analytical theory is developed
which describes the manner in which new connections form within fragmented
current layers in the absence of magnetic nulls. It is shown that the
collective rate at which new connections form can be characterized by two
measures; a total rate which measures the true rate at which new connections
are formed and a net rate which measures the net change of connection
associated with the largest value of the integral of $E_{\|}$ through all of
the non-ideal regions. Two simple analytical models are presented which
demonstrate how each should be applied and what they quantify.

Ta \approx \Delta Tmb \approx 3.0 - 3.5$ mK rms in 0.55 km/s channels), was
carried out as a pilot project with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT, FWHM
$\approx 7.6'$) on a 3 X 9 grid at $0.5\deg$ spacing. The pointings chosen
correspond with those of the existing $^{12}$CO(1-0) CfA survey of the Galaxy
(FWHM $\approx 8.4'$). With 2-hr integrations, 1667 MHz OH emission was
detected with the GBT at $\gtrsim 21$ of the 27 survey positions ($\geq 78\%$
), confirming the ubiquity of molecular gas in the ISM as traced by this
spectral line. With few exceptions, the main OH lines at 1665 and 1667 MHz
appear in the ratio of 5:9 characteristic of LTE at our sensitivity levels. No
OH absorption features are recorded in the area of the present survey, in
agreement with the low levels of continuum background emission in this
direction. At each pointing the OH emission appears in several components
extending over a range of radial velocity and coinciding with well-known
features of Galactic structure such as the Local Arm and the Perseus Arm. In
contrast, little CO emission is seen in the survey area; less than half of the
$\gtrsim 50$ identified OH components show detectable CO at the CfA sensitivity
levels, and these are generally faint. There are no CO profiles without OH
emission. With few exceptions, peaks in the OH profiles coincide with peaks in
the GBT HI spectra (obtained concurrently, FWHM $8.9'$), although the converse
is not true. We conclude that main-line OH emission is a promising tracer for
the ""dark molecular gas"" in the Galaxy discovered earlier in Far-IR and
gamma-ray emission. Further work is needed to establish the quantitative
details of this connection.

estimation of the linear, quadratic and the L2-norm functionals on classes of
sparse vectors and construct optimal estimators that attain these rates. The
main object of interest is the class s-sparse vectors for which we also provide
completely adaptive estimators (independent of s and of the noise variance)
having only logarithmically slower rates than the minimax ones. Furthermore, we
obtain the minimax rates on the Lq-balls where 0 < q < 2. This analysis shows
that there are, in general, three zones in the rates of convergence that we
call the sparse zone, the dense zone and the degenerate zone, while a fourth
zone appears for estimation of the quadratic functional. We show that, as
opposed to estimation of the vector, the correct logarithmic terms in the
optimal rates for the sparse zone scale as log(d/s^2) and not as log(d/s). For
the sparse class, the rates of estimation of the linear functional and of the
L2-norm have a simple elbow at s = sqrt(d) (boundary between the sparse and the
dense zones) and exhibit similar performances, whereas the estimation of the
quadratic functional reveals more complex effects and is not possible only on
the basis of sparsity described by the sparsity condition on the vector.
Finally, we apply our results on estimation of the L2-norm to the problem of
testing against sparse alternatives. In particular, we obtain a non-asymptotic
analog of the Ingster-Donoho-Jin theory revealing some effects that were not
captured by the previous asymptotic analysis.

position x and momentum p of a particle can be known simultaneously. You may
know the probability distributions of x and p individually but the joint
distribution makes no physical sense. Yet Wigner exhibited such a joint
distribution f(x,p). There was, however, a little trouble with it: some of its
values were negative. Nevertheless Wigner's discovery attracted attention and
found applications. There are other joint distribution, all with negative

Wigner's distribution produces the correct marginal distributions for all

the 0.5--8, 0.5--2 and 2--8 keV bands, respectively; the number of unique

398 sources with more than 40 counts in the 0.5--8 keV band. We compare the
best-fit fluxes with the catalogue ones, obtained by assuming a common photon
index of Gamma=1.7; we find no bulk difference between the fluxes, and a
moderate dispersion of s=0.33 dex. Using wherever possible the fluxes from the

Euclidean distribution. Finally, we release computer code for the tools

metric. The charged McVittie solution is revisited and a brief study of its

hole in an expanding universe, with the black hole horizon being formed at
infinite late times. Charged versions of solutions originally put forward by
Vaidya (Vd) and Sultana and Dyer (SD) are also analyzed. It is shown that the
charged Sultana-Dyer metric requires a global electric current, besides a
central (pointlike) electric charge. With the aim of comparing to the charged
McVittie metric, new charged solutions of Vd and SD type are considered. In
these cases, the original mass and charge parameters are replaced by particular
functions of the cosmological time. In the new generalized charged Vaidya
metric the black hole horizon never forms, whereas in the new generalized
Sultana-Dyer case both the Cauchy and the black hole horizons develop at
infinite late times. A charged version of the Thakurta metric is also studied
here. It is also a new solution. As in the charged Sultana-Dyer case, the
natural source of the electromagnetic field is a central electric charge with
an additional global electric current. The global structure is briefly studied
and it is verified that the corresponding spacetime may represent a charged
black hole in a cosmological background. All the solutions present initial

cities. We combine these two pursuits and uncover reproducible mobility
patterns amongst social contacts. First, we introduce measures of mobility
similarity and predictability and measure them for populations of users in
three large urban areas. We find individuals' visitations patterns are far more
similar to and predictable by social contacts than strangers and that these
measures are positively correlated with tie strength. Unsupervised clustering
of hourly variations in mobility similarity identifies three categories of
social ties and suggests geography is an important feature to contextualize
social relationships. We find that the composition of a user's ego network in
terms of the type of contacts they keep is correlated with mobility behavior.
Finally, we extend a popular mobility model to include movement choices based
on social contacts and compare it's ability to reproduce empirical measurements

to the position of electrons and their momentum distribution. Elastic X-ray
scattering forms the basis of atomic structural determination while inelastic
Compton scattering is often used as a spectroscopic probe of both

(XFELs) are unique tools for studying matter on its natural time and length
scales due to their bright and coherent ultrashort pulses. However, in the
focus of an XFEL the assumption of a weak linear probe breaks down, and
nonlinear light-matter interactions can become ubiquitous. The field can be
sufficiently high that even non-resonant multiphoton interactions at hard
X-rays wavelengths become relevant. Here we report the observation of one of
the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray-matter interactions, the simultaneous
Compton scattering of two identical photons producing a single photon at nearly
twice the photon energy. We measure scattered photons with an energy near 18
keV generated from solid beryllium irradiated by 8.8-9.75 keV XFEL pulses. The
intensity in the X-ray focus reaches up to 4x20 W/cm2, which corresponds to a
peak electric field two orders of magnitude higher than the atomic unit of
field-strength and within four orders of magnitude of the quantum
electrodynamic critical field. The observed signal scales quadratically in
intensity and is emitted into a non-dipolar pattern, consistent with the
simultaneous two-photon scattering from free electrons. However, the energy of
the generated photons shows an anomalously large redshift only present at high

effectively interacts with a different electron momentum distribution than

planetary system as it puts strong constraints on the moment when the system
was born. Unfortunately, the determination of precise stellar ages is a very
difficult task. Different methods can be used to do so (based on isochrones or
chemical element abundances) but they usually provide large uncertainties.
During its evolution a star goes through processes leading to loss of angular
momentum but also changes in its magnetic activity. Building rotation,
magnetic, age relations would be an asset to infer stellar ages model
independently. Several attempts to build empirical relations between rotation
and age (namely gyrochronology) were made with a focus on cluster stars where
the age determination is easier and for young stars on the main sequence. For
field stars, we can now take advantage of high-precision photometric
observations where we can perform asteroseismic analyses to improve the
accuracy of stellar ages. Furthermore, the variability in the light curves
allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar rotation and magnetic
activity. By combining these precise measurements, we are on the way of
understanding and improving relations between magnetic activity, rotation, and
age, in particular at different stages of stellar evolution. I will review the
status on gyrochronology relationships based on observations of young cluster
stars. Then I will focus on solar-like stars and describe the inferences on
stellar ages, rotation, and magnetism that can be provided by high-quality

the quantum system is controllable, (2) the Jacobian of the map from the

constraints on the control field. This paper investigates how the violation of
assumption (3) affects gradient searches for globally optimal control fields.
The satisfaction of assumptions (1) and (2) ensures that the control landscape
lacks fundamental traps, but certain control constraints can still introduce
artificial traps. Proper management of these constraints is an issue of great
practical importance for numerical simulations as well as optimization in the
laboratory. Using optimal control simulations, we show that constraints on
quantities such as the number of control variables, the control duration, and
the field strength are potentially severe enough to prevent successful
optimization of the objective. For each such constraint, we show that exceeding
quantifiable limits can prevent gradient searches from reaching a globally
optimal solution. These results demonstrate that careful choice of relevant
control parameters helps to eliminate artificial traps and facilitate
successful optimization.

reservoir, with a small number of tunable parameters to generate a
high-dimensional representation of an input, and a readout layer which is
easily trained using regression to produce a desired output from the reservoir
states. Certain computational tasks involve real-time calculation of high-order
time correlations, which requires nonlinear transformation either in the
reservoir or the readout layer. Traditional ESN employs a reservoir with
sigmoid or tanh function neurons. In contrast, some types of biological neurons
obey response curves that can be described as a product unit rather than a sum
and threshold. Inspired by this class of neurons, we introduce a RC
architecture with a reservoir of product nodes for time series computation. We
find that the product RC shows many properties of standard ESN such as
short-term memory and nonlinear capacity. On standard benchmarks for chaotic
prediction tasks, the product RC maintains the performance of a standard
nonlinear ESN while being more amenable to mathematical analysis. Our study
provides evidence that such networks are powerful in highly nonlinear tasks

shear stress. We obtain zero-temperature jammed states under desired shear
stresses and investigate their mechanical properties as a function of the shear
stress. As a comparison, we also obtain jammed states from the
quasistatic-shear sampling in which the shear stress is not well-controlled.
Although the yield stresses determined by both samplings show the same
power-law scaling with the compression from point $J$, i.e.~the jamming
transition point at zero temperature and shear stress, for finite size systems,
the quasistatic-shear sampling leads to a lower yield stress and a higher
critical volume fraction of point $J$. The shear modulus of jammed solids
decreases when increasing the shear stress. However, the shear modulus does not
decay to zero at yielding. This discontinuous change of the shear modulus
implies the discontinuous nature of the unjamming transition under nonzero
shear stress, which is further verified by the observation of a discontinuous
jump of the pressure from jammed solids to shear flows. The pressure jump
decreases upon decompression and approaches zero at the critical-like point
$J$, in analogy with well-known phase transitions under external field. The
analysis of force networks in jammed solids reveals that the force distribution
is more sensitive to the increase of the shear stress near point $J$. The force
network anisotropy increases with the shear stress. Weak particle contacts near
the average force and under large shear stresses exhibit asymmetric angle
distribution.

varying the size of the non-magnetic cation. Here, we report on a new family of
lead-based pyrochlores A$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ (A = Pr, Nd, Gd), which we have
characterized with magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Lead is the
largest known possible B-site cation for the pyrochlore lattice. Thus, these
materials significantly expand the phase space of the frustrated pyrochlores.
Pr$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ has an absence of long-range magnetic order down to 400 mK
and a spin ice-like heat capacity anomaly at 1.2 K. Thus, Pr$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ is
a candidate for a quantum spin ice state, despite weaker exchange.
Nd$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ transitions to a magnetically ordered state at 0.41 K. The
Weiss temperature for Nd$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ is $\theta_{\text{CW}}$ = $-$0.06 K,
indicating close competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
interactions. Gd$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ is a Heisenberg antiferromagnet that
transitions to long-range magnetic order at 0.81 K, in spite of significant
site mixing. Below its ordering transition, we find a $T^{3/2}$ heat capacity
dependence in Gd$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$, confirmation of a ground state that is
distinct from other gadolinium pyrochlores. These lead-based pyrochlores
provide insight into the effects of weakened exchange on highly frustrated

variations. We thus define the model with three layers: the leaf-nodes for
detecting local contour fragments, the or-nodes specifying selection of
leaf-nodes, and the root-node encoding the holistic distortion. In the training

concave-convex procedure (CCCP) by embedding the structural clustering during

with the model optimization, which integrates the local testings via the

result, serial femtosecond crystallography does not need to be performed with
pulses as short as 5--10 fs, as once thought, but can succeed for pulses
50--100 fs in duration. We show here that a similar gating effect applies to
single molecule diffraction with respect to spatially uncorrelated damage
processes like ionization and ion diffusion. The effect is clearly seen in
calculations of the diffraction contrast, by calculating the diffraction of
average structure separately to the diffraction from statistical fluctuations
of the structure due to damage (""damage noise""). Our results suggest that
sub-nanometer single molecule imaging with 30--50 fs pulses, like those
produced at currently operating facilities, should not yet be ruled out. The
theory we present opens up new experimental avenues to measure the impact of
damage on single particle diffraction, which is needed to test damage models
and to identify optimal imaging conditions.

the required shape invariants and a known result on canonical correlations

for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly available,
which entails the development of efficient and effective statistical
approaches. Although many such approaches have been developed and used to
identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with
complex traits or diseases, few are able to detect gene-gene interactions among
different SNPs. Genetic interactions, also known as epistasis, have been
recognized to play a pivotal role in contributing to the genetic variation of
phenotypic traits. However, because of an extremely large number of SNP-SNP
combinations in GWAS, the model dimensionality can quickly become so
overwhelming that no prevailing variable selection methods are capable of
handling this problem. In this paper, we present a statistical framework for
characterizing main genetic effects and epistatic interactions in a GWAS study.
Specifically, we first propose a two-stage sure independence screening (TS-SIS)
procedure and generate a pool of candidate SNPs and interactions, which serve
as predictors to explain and predict the phenotypes of a complex trait. We also
propose a rates adjusted thresholding estimation (RATE) approach to determine
the size of the reduced model selected by an independence screening.
Regularization regression methods, such as LASSO or SCAD, are then applied to
further identify important genetic effects. Simulation studies show that the
TS-SIS procedure is computationally efficient and has an outstanding finite
sample performance in selecting potential SNPs as well as gene-gene
interactions. We apply the proposed framework to analyze an
ultrahigh-dimensional GWAS data set from the Framingham Heart Study, and select
23 active SNPs and 24 active epistatic interactions for the body mass index
variation. It shows the capability of our procedure to resolve the complexity
of genetic control.

annotated with tags; (ii) recovering its pixel labels by propagating semantics
from the references. We present a novel framework making the two steps mutually
conditional and bootstrapped under the probabilistic Expectation-Maximization
(EM) formulation. In the first step, the references are selected by jointly
matching their appearances with the target as well as the semantics (i.e. the
assigned labels of the target and the references). We process the second step
via a combinatorial graphical representation, in which the vertices are
superpixels extracted from the target and its selected references. Then we
derive the potentials of assigning labels to one vertex of the target, which
depend upon the graph edges that connect the vertex to its spatial neighbors of
the target and to its similar vertices of the references. Besides, the proposed
framework can be naturally applied to perform image annotation on new test
images. In the experiments, we validate our approach on two public databases,

subgroup or regression analysis with focus on the treatment-by-marker
interaction. Under a potential outcome framework (Huang, Gilbert and Janes
[Biometrics 68 (2012) 687-696]), a predictive biomarker is considered a
predictor for a desirable treatment benefit (defined by comparing potential
outcomes for different treatments) and evaluated using familiar concepts in
prediction and classification. However, the desired treatment benefit is
unobservable because each patient can receive only one treatment in a typical
study. Huang et al. overcome this problem by assuming monotonicity of potential
outcomes, with one treatment dominating the other in all patients. Motivated by
an HIV example that appears to violate the monotonicity assumption, we propose
a different approach based on covariates and random effects for evaluating
predictive biomarkers under the potential outcome framework. Under the proposed
approach, the parameters of interest can be identified by assuming conditional
independence of potential outcomes given observed covariates, and a sensitivity
analysis can be performed by incorporating an unobserved random effect that
accounts for any residual dependence. Application of this approach to the
motivating example shows that baseline viral load and CD4 cell count are both
useful as predictive biomarkers for choosing antiretroviral drugs for
treatment-naive patients.

humans and almost all multicellular animals. However, its underlying kinetic
mechanism is unclear. The Gompertz law cannot explain the effect of temperature
on lifespan and the mortality plateau at advanced ages. In this study a
reaction kinetics model with a time dependent rate coefficient is proposed to
describe the survival and senescence processes. A temperature-dependent
mortality function was derived. The new mortality function becomes the Gompertz
mortality function with the same relationship of parameters prescribed by the
Strehler-Mildvan correlation when age is smaller than a characteristic value
{\delta}, and reaches the mortality plateau when age is greater than {\delta}.
A closed-form analytical expression for describing the relationship of average
lifespan with temperature and other equations are derived from the new
mortality function. The derived equations can be used to estimate the limit of
average lifespan, predict the maximal longevity, calculate the temperature
coefficient of lifespan, and explain the tendency of survival curve. This
prediction is consistent with the most recently reported mortality trajectories
for single-year birth cohorts. This study suggests that the senescence process
results from the imbalance between damaging energy and protecting energy for
the critical chemical substance in the body. The rate of senescence of the
organism increases while the protecting energy decreases. The mortality plateau
is reached when the protecting energy decreases to its minimal levels. The
decreasing rate of the protecting energy is temperature-dependent. This study
is exploring the connection between biochemical mechanism and demography.

the more stable zigzag hollow edges. In hexagonal nanoislands, which are
constrained by geometry to alternate zigzag hollow and zigzag top edges along

clusters. It is found that the $m^*_n-m^*_p$ has a relatively stronger effect
than the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ and the assumption of $m^*_n\leq m^*_p$ leads to a
higher neutron/proton ratio. Moreover, this finding is independent of the
in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections used. However, results of our
calculations using the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ and $m^*_n-m^*_p$ both within their
current uncertainty ranges are all too low compared to the recent NSCL/MSU
double neutron/proton ratio data from central $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn and
$^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn collisions at 50 and 120 MeV/u, thus calling for new

decade, and has led to major advances in our understanding of stellar magnetic
fields and of their impact on stellar structure and evolution. Many important
discoveries have been obtained thanks to observations performed with the FORS
low-resolution spectropolarimeters of the ESO Very Large Telescope. We first
review and summarise the major results of a homogeneous re-reduction and
analysis of all single-slit FORS1 spectropolarimetric observations. This work
revealed a non-negligible dependence of the results upon the adopted reduction
and analysis procedure, as well as the presence of instabilities, revealing
that photon noise is not the only source of uncertainty. As a consequence of
our new analysis and assessment of the uncertainties, we are not able to
confirm a large number of magnetic field detections presented in the past for a
variety of stars. We further summarise the results of FORS2 spectropolarimetric
observations of the A0 supergiant HD92207 which allowed us to explore further
the nature of the instabilities, roughly constraining their maximum impact on
the derived Stokes profiles and magnetic field values. We finally present new
results obtained with a further independent pipeline on the FORS2 data of
HD92207, confirming our previous analysis, and discuss simple quality-check
controls which can be performed on the data in order to distinguish between
genuine and spurious signals. All together, our results reveal that the FORS
spectropolarimeters are indeed reliable instruments, when their capabilities
are not pushed beyond the limits of a Cassegrain mounted low-resolution
spectrograph.

degradation, also named ""software aging"", due to internal (e.g. software bugs)
and external (e.g. resource exhaustion) impairments. These chronic problems
often fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe
impacts (e.g. system failure). Therefore it's a challenging issue how to timely
detect these problems to prevent system crash. Although a large quantity of
approaches have been proposed to solve this issue, the accuracy and
effectiveness of these approaches are still far from satisfactory due to the
insufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. In this paper, we present a
novel entropy-based aging indicator, Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy
(MMSE). MMSE employs the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to
indicate software aging and leverages multi-scale and multi-dimension
integration to tolerate system fluctuations. Via theoretical proof and
experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that MMSE satisfies Stability,
Monotonicity and Integration which we conjecture that an ideal aging indicator
should have. Based upon MMSE, we develop three failure detection approaches
encapsulated in a proof-of-concept named CHAOS. The experimental evaluations in
a Video on Demand (VoD) system and in a real-world production system,
AntVision, show that CHAOS can detect the failure-prone state in an
extraordinarily high accuracy and a near 0 Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF).
Compared to previous approaches, CHAOS improves the detection accuracy by about
5 times and reduces the ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, CHAOS
is light-weight enough to satisfy the realtime requirement.

based time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering at the X-ray Free Electron laser
LCLS. A well-ordered stripe domain pattern as present in a thin CoPd alloy film
has been used as prototype magnetic domain structure for this study. The
fluence of the IR laser pump pulse was sufficient to lead to an almost complete
quenching of the magnetization within the ultrafast demagnetization process
taking place within the first few hundreds of femtoseconds following the IR
laser pump pulse excitation. On longer time scales this excitation gave rise to
subsequent irreversible transformations of the magnetic domain structure. Under
our specific experimental conditions, it took about 2 nanoseconds before the
magnetization started to recover. After about 5 nanoseconds the previously
ordered stripe domain structure had evolved into a disordered labyrinth domain
structure. Surprisingly, we observe after about 7 nanoseconds the occurrence of
a partially ordered stripe domain structure reoriented into a novel direction.
It is this domain structure in which the sample's magnetization stabilizes as
revealed by scattering patterns recorded long after the initial pump-probe
cycle. Using micro-magnetic simulations we can explain this observation based
on changes of the magnetic anisotropy going along with heat dissipation in the
film.

existence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe
them in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by
different structural properties. From the point of view of network topology, an
autocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected
components (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets
(RAFs). We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the
probability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region
where the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter
also affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized
into linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs. Interestingly, we show that the
different network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems)
does not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance,
whereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to
play a role. A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and
that may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be
the presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or

estimates of transfer operators on a reduced phase space to develop an early
warning indicator of the zonal to blocked flow transition in this model. It is
shown that, the spectrum of the transfer operators can be used to study the
slow dynamics of the flow as well as the non-Markovian character of the
reduction. The slowest motions are thereby found to have time scales of three
to six weeks and to be associated with meta-stable regimes (and their
transitions) which can be detected as almost-invariant sets of the transfer
operator. From the energy budget of the model, we are able to explain the
meta-stability of the regimes and the existence of preferred transition paths.
Even though the model is highly simplified, the skill of the early warning
indicator is promising, suggesting that the transfer operator approach can be
used in parallel to an operational deterministic model for stochastic
prediction or to assess forecast uncertainty.

and the timing of its peak concentration in the atmosphere is likely to govern
the timing of maximum radiative forcing. It is well-known that dynamics of
atmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants, and here we approximate
the solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four
time-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in
CO2 emissions and concentrations, and therefore the timing of the concentration
peak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of
change of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio
is large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and
concentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of
this ratio through mitigation, in order to achieve an early peak in CO2
concentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak,
combined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity, because the delay
between peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with
which decarbonization occurs. Of course, for limiting the magnitude of peak
concentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions
throughout its trajectory, but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is
not examined here. The carbon cycle parameters affecting the timing of the
concentration peak are primarily the long multi-century time-constant of
atmospheric CO2, and the ratio of contributions to the impulse response
function of atmospheric CO2 from the infinite time-constant and the long
time-constant respectively. Reducing uncertainties in these parameters can
reduce uncertainty in forecasts of the radiative forcing peak.

numbers: Hubble parameter ${{H}_{0}}$ and deceleration parameter ${{q}_{0}}$.
The first of the two basic cosmological parameters (the Hubble parameter)
describes the linear part of the time dependence of the scale factor. Treating
the Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is
non-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while
non-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of
the Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon
as the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which
determine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the
Universe' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both
static and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$
and ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale
factor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological
expansion.
  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the
Universe. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion
rate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy
number variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this
number either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to
stay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).
  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- ""Cosmology
in terms of the deceleration parameter"". We would like to show that practically
any aspect of the cosmological evolution is tightly bound to the deceleration
parameter.

aspects the formation of laminar holes in transitional turbulence of plane

the Reynolds number R which force the formation of holes. The Reynolds number
is decreased from featureless turbulence to the range of existence of the
oblique laminar-turbulent bands [Rg;Rt]. The successive stages of the quench
are studied by means of visualisations and measurements of kinetic energy and
turbulent fraction. The behaviour of the kinetic energy is explained using a
kinetic energy budget: it shows that viscosity causes quasi modal decay until
lift-up equals it and creates a new balance. Moreover, the budget confirms that
the physical mechanisms at play are independent of the way the quench is
performed. On the other hand we consider the natural formation of laminar holes
in the bands, near Rg. The Direct Numerical simulations (DNS) show that holes
in the turbulent bands provide a mechanism for the fragmented bands regime and
orientation fluctuations near Rg. Moreover the analysis of the fluctuations of
kinetic energy toward low values demonstrates that the disappearance of
turbulence in the bands can be described within the framework of Large
Deviations. A Large Deviation function is extracted from the Probability
Density Function of the kinetic energy.

topological properties of this transition, both analytically and by numerical
simulation, using a lattice-field description of the two-dimensional Coulomb
gas on a torus. The BKT transition is shown to be an ergodicity breaking
between the topological sectors of the electric field, which implies a
definition of topological order in terms of broken ergodicity. The breakdown of
local topological order at the BKT transition leads to the excitation of global
topological defects in the electric field, corresponding to different
topological sectors. The quantized nature of these classical excitations, and
their strict suppression by ergodicity breaking in the low-temperature phase,

recently, most existing approaches assume both a linear relationship and a
scalar response variable. We suggest a new method, ""Functional Response
Additive Model Estimation"" (FRAME), which extends the usual linear regression
model to situations involving both functional predictors, $X_j(t)$, scalar
predictors, $Z_k$, and functional responses, $Y(s)$. Our approach uses a
penalized least squares optimization criterion to automatically perform
variable selection in situations involving multiple functional and scalar
predictors. In addition, our method uses an efficient coordinate descent
algorithm to fit general nonlinear additive relationships between the
predictors and response. We develop our model for novel forecasting challenges
in the entertainment industry. In particular, we set out to model the decay
rate of demand for Hollywood movies using the predictive power of online
virtual stock markets (VSMs). VSMs are online communities that, in a
market-like fashion, gather the crowds' prediction about demand for a
particular product. Our fully functional model captures the pattern of
pre-release VSM trading prices and provides superior predictive accuracy of a
movie's post-release demand in comparison to traditional methods. In addition,
we propose graphical tools which give a glimpse into the causal relationship
between market behavior and box office revenue patterns, and hence provide
valuable insight to movie decision makers.

made, it remains challenging. Physicists usually apply the concepts and methods
in statistical physics, such as temporal correlation functions, to study
financial dynamics. However, the usual volatility-return correlation function,
which is local in time, typically fluctuates around zero. Here we construct
dynamic observables nonlocal in time to explore the volatility-return
correlation, based on the empirical data of hundreds of individual stocks and
25 stock market indices in different countries. Strikingly, the correlation is
discovered to be non-zero, with an amplitude of a few percent and a duration of
over two weeks. This result provides compelling evidence that past volatilities
nonlocal in time affect future returns. Further, we introduce an agent-based
model with a novel mechanism, that is, the asymmetric trading preference in
volatile and stable markets, to understand the microscopic origin of the
volatility-return correlation nonlocal in time.

LiCS'04), the categorical compositional distributional model of natural
language meaning of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark provides a conceptually
motivated procedure to compute the meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical
structure within a Lambek pregroup and a vectorial representation of the
meaning of its parts. The predictions of this first model have outperformed
that of other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks on large
scale data. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we
interpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret
word meaning.
  In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum
mechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's
CPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity
and distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and
polysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means
a passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change
of model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily
adopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data.
This experiment moreover provides preliminary evidence of the validity of our
proposed new model for word meaning.
  Secondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative
counterparts that arise in the image of the CPM-construction allow for encoding
relative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, and finally, iteration of the
CPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm,
enables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity.

number of dictionary atoms. As a generative model, it requires the dictionary
to be highly redundant in order to ensure both a stable high sparsity level and
a low reconstruction error for the signal. However, in practice, this
requirement is usually impaired by the lack of labelled training samples.
Fortunately, previous research has shown that the requirement for a redundant
dictionary can be less rigorous if simultaneous sparse approximation is
employed, which can be carried out by enforcing various structured sparsity
constraints on the sparse codes of the neighboring pixels. In addition,
numerous works have shown that applying a variety of dictionary learning
methods for the sparse representation model can also improve the classification
performance. In this paper, we highlight the task-driven dictionary learning
algorithm, which is a general framework for the supervised dictionary learning
method. We propose to enforce structured sparsity priors on the task-driven
dictionary learning method in order to improve the performance of the
hyperspectral classification. Our approach is able to benefit from both the
advantages of the simultaneous sparse representation and those of the
supervised dictionary learning. We enforce two different structured sparsity
priors, the joint and Laplacian sparsity, on the task-driven dictionary
learning method and provide the details of the corresponding optimization
algorithms. Experiments on numerous popular hyperspectral images demonstrate
that the classification performance of our approach is superior to sparse
representation classifier with structured priors or the task-driven dictionary
learning method.

Multiset Genetic Algorithm (MuGA). The symbiogenetic approach used here is
based on the host-parasite model with the novelty of varying the length of
parasites along the evolutionary process. Additionally, it models
collaborations between multiple parasites and a single host. To improve
efficiency, we introduced proxy evaluation of parasites, which saves fitness
function calls and exponentially reduces the symbiotic collaborations produced.
Another novel feature consists of breaking the evolutionary cycle into two
phases: a symbiotic phase and a phase of independent evolution of both hosts
and parasites. SMuGA was tested in optimization of a variety of deceptive
functions, with results one order of magnitude better than state of the art
symbiotic algorithms. This allowed to optimize deceptive problems with large
sizes, and showed a linear scaling in the number of iterations to attain the
optimum.

calibrate REACT confidence distances and perform a bias control using many

that the $Z'$ boson at tree level has (i) no $Z$-$Z'$ mixing, (ii) no
interaction with charged leptons, and (iii) no flavour-changing neutral
current. Under such a setup, it is shown that in the $N=1$ case, all the
$U(1)'$ charges of left-handed quark doublets and right-handed up- and
down-type quarks are required to be the same, while in the $N \ge 3$ case one
can take different charges for the three types of quarks. The $N=2$ case is not
well-defined under the above three requirements. We study the $pp\to Z'V\to
b\bar{b}V$ processes ($V=\gamma,~Z$ and $W^\pm$) with the leptonic decays of
$Z$ and $W^\pm$ at the LHC. The most promising discovery channel or the most
stringent constraint on the $U(1)'$ gauge coupling constant comes from the
$Z'\gamma$ process below the $t\bar{t}$ threshold and from the $t\bar{t}$
process above the threshold. Assuming the collision energy of 8 TeV and the
integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb$^{-1}$, we find that the constraint from the
$Z'\gamma$ search in the lower mass regime can be stronger than that from the
UA2 experiment. In the $N \ge 3$ case, we consider four benchmark points for
the $Z'$ couplings with quarks. It is noted that if such a $Z'$ is discovered,
a careful comparison between the $Z'\gamma$ and $Z'W$ signals is crucial to
reveal the nature of $Z'$ couplings with quarks. We also present the discovery
reach of the $Z'$ boson at the 14-TeV LHC in both $N=1$ and $N\geq 3$ cases.

spectropolarimeter working from 119 to 888 nm. A preliminary optical design of
the whole instrument has been prepared and is presented here. The design
consists of the telescope, the instrument itself, and the focusing optics.
Considering not only the scientific requirements, but also the cost and size
constraints to fit a M-size mission, the telescope has a 1.3 m diameter primary
mirror and is a classical Cassegrain-type telescope that allows a
polarization-free focus. The polarimeter is placed at this Cassegrain focus.
This is the key element of the mission and the most challenging to be designed.
The main challenge lies in the huge spectral range offered by the instrument;
the polarimeter has to deliver the full Stokes vector with a high precision
from the FUV (119 nm) to the NIR (888 nm). The polarimeter module is then
followed by a high-resolution echelle-spectrometer achieving a resolution of
35000 in the visible range and 25000 in the UV. The two channels are separated
after the echelle grating, allowing a specific cross-dispersion and focusing
optics for the UV and visible ranges. Considering the large field of view and
the high numerical aperture, the focusing optic for both the UV and visible
channels is a Three-Mirror-Anastigmat (TMA) telescope, in order to focus the
various wavelengths and many orders onto the detectors.

by very large-scale physical capital that is custom-built with long lead times

automation has made possible the parallel operation of large numbers of
small-scale and modular production units. Amenable to mass-production, these
units can be more rapidly deployed but they are also likely to have a much
quicker turnover. Such a paradigm shift motivates the analysis of the combined
effect of lead time and lifetime on infrastructure investment decisions. In
order to value the underlying real option, we introduce an optimal multiple
stopping approach that accounts for operational flexibility, delay induced by
lead time, and multiple (finite/infinite) future investment opportunities. We
provide an analytical characterization of the firm's value function and optimal
stopping rule. This leads us to develop an iterative numerical scheme, and
examine how the investment decisions depend on lead time and lifetime, as well
as other parameters. Furthermore, our model can be used to analyze the critical
investment cost that makes small-scale (short lead time, short lifetime)
alternatives competitive with traditional large-scale infrastructure.

applications in several fields, including differential equations, pattern

technique combined with an optimization problem inspired by recent results in
compressed sensing research. The discussion includes approximation error rates

revealed that different atomic arrangements due to different twist angles can
result in similar geometric moir\'e periods such that, only a small fraction of
the observed moir\'e periodicities may coincide with the real atomic

the band structure of moir\'e patterns exhibit the fingerprints of those of

using the M\""ossbauer effect, confirms the general conclusions of a previous
paper dedicated to experiments with photons emitted/absorbed by atoms/nuclei in
inertial flight. The wave theory of light is so deeply rooted that it has
been--and currently is--applied to describe phenomena in which the fundamental
entities at work are discrete (photons). The fact that the wave theory of light
can describe one aspect of these phenomena can not overshadow two issues: the
corpuscular theory of light, firstly applied to the Doppler effect for photons
by Schr\""odinger in 1922, is by far more complete since it describes all the
features of the studied phenomena; the wave theory can be used only when the
number of photons at work is statistically significant. The disregard of basic
methodological criteria may appear as a minor fault. However, the historical
development of quantum physics shows that the predominance of the wave theory
of radiation, beyond its natural application domain, has hampered the
reorientation toward the photon description of the underlying phenomena.

polymers (EAPs), there is a growing need for electromechanical models which
accurately capture their behavior. To this end, we compare the predicted
behavior of EAPs undergoing homogenous deformations according to three
electromechanical models. The first model is a continuum based model composed
of the mechanical Gent model and a linear relationship between the electric
field and the polarization. The electrical and the mechanical responses
according to the second model are based on the polymer microstructure, whereas
the third model incorporates a neo-Hookean mechanical response and a
microstructural based long-chains model for the electrical behavior. In the
microstructural motivated models the integration from the microscopic to the
macroscopic levels is accomplished by the micro-sphere technique. Four types of
homogeneous boundary conditions are considered and the behaviors determined
according to the three models are compared. The differences between the
predictions of the models are discussed, highlighting the need for an in-depth
investigation of the relations between the structure and the behaviors of the
EAPs at microscopic level and their overall macroscopic response.

time dilation. In that paper, the flying atom was conceived as a flying clock:
the reference to the Doppler effect was only indirect (the experiments by Stark
to the first order of $v/c$). In 1922, Schr\""odinger showed that the emission
of a light quantum by a (flying) atom is regulated by the conservation laws of
energy and linear momentum. Therefore, the Doppler effect for photons is the
consequence of the energy and momentum exchange between the atom and the
photon: a central role is played by the quantum energy jump $\Delta E$ of the
transition (a relativistic invariant). The first realization of the experiment
devised by Einstein is due to Ives and Stilwell (1938). Since then till
nowadays experiments of this kind have been repeated in search of better
precision and/or a deviation from the predictions of special relativity. The
striking feature is that all the papers dealing with these experiments
completely neglect Schr\""odinger's dynamical treatment. The origins of this
omission are of different kind: pragmatic (agreement between formulas, wherever
coming from, and experiments), historical (deep rooting of the wave theory of
light) and epistemological (neglect of basic epistemological rules).

are used to solve problems on classes consisting of algebras having a neat

well as Hirsch and Hodkinson on atom-canonicity and complete representations,
respectively. For proving non-atom-canonicity of infinitely many varieties
approximating the variety of representable algebras of dimension n, so-called
blow up and blur constructions are used. Rainbow constructions are compared to
constructions using Monk-like algebras and cases where both constructions work
are given. When splitting methods fail. rainbow constructions are used to show
that diagonal free varieties of representable diagonal free algebras of finite
dimension n, do no admit universal axiomatizations containing only finitely
many variables. Notions of representability, like complete, weak and strong are
lifted from atom structures to atomic algebras and investigated in terms of
neat embedding properties. The classical results of Monk and Maddux on
non-finite axiomatizability of the classes of representable relation and
cylindric algebras of finite dimension n are reproved using also a blow up and
blur construction. Applications to n-variable fragments of first order logic
are given. The main results of the paper are summarized in tabular form at the

  model error in parametric models",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2015.12.043",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semiparametric forecasting and filtering are introduced as a method of
addressing model errors arising from unresolved physical phenomena. While
traditional parametric models are able to learn high-dimensional systems from
small data sets, their rigid parametric structure makes them vulnerable to
model error. On the other hand, nonparametric models have a very flexible
structure, but they suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality and are not
practical for high-dimensional systems. The semiparametric approach loosens the
structure of a parametric model by fitting a data-driven nonparametric model
for the parameters. Given a parametric dynamical model and a noisy data set of
historical observations, an adaptive Kalman filter is used to extract a
time-series of the parameter values. A nonparametric forecasting model for the
parameters is built by projecting the discrete shift map onto a data-driven
basis of smooth functions. Existing techniques for filtering and forecasting
algorithms extend naturally to the semiparametric model which can effectively
compensate for model error, with forecasting skill approaching that of the
perfect model. Semiparametric forecasting and filtering are a generalization of
statistical semiparametric models to time-dependent distributions evolving
under dynamical systems.

the applicability of the indifference principle by showing that it may yield

Jaynes claimed that symmetry requirements (the principle of transformation
groups) solve the paradox by selecting a unique solution to the problem. I show
that this is not the case and that every variant obtained from the principle of
indifference can also be obtained from Jaynes' principle of transformation
groups. This is because the same symmetries can be mathematically implemented
in different ways, depending on the procedure of random selection that one
uses. I describe a simple experiment that supports a result from symmetry
arguments, but the solution is different from Jaynes'. Jaynes' method is thus
best seen as a tool to obtain probability distributions when the principle of
indifference is inconvenient, but it cannot resolve ambiguities inherent in the
use of that principle and still depends on explicitly defining the selection
procedure.
