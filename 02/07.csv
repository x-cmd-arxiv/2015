medium (IGM) and of the growth of massive galaxies and black holes in the early
universe. Absorption due to neutral Hydrogen in the IGM makes quasars beyond a
redshift of z~6.5 very faint in the optical $z$-band, thus locating quasars at
higher redshifts require large surveys that are sensitive above 1 micron. We
report the discovery of three new z>6.5 quasars, corresponding to an age of the
universe of <850 Myr, selected as z-band dropouts in the Pan-STARRS1 survey.
This increases the number of known z>6.5 quasars from 4 to 7. The quasars have
redshifts of z=6.50, 6.52, and 6.66, and include the brightest z-dropout quasar
reported to date, PSO J036.5078+03.0498 with M_1450=-27.4. We obtained
near-infrared spectroscopy for the quasars and from the MgII line we estimate
that the central black holes have masses between 5x10^8 and 4x10^9 M_sun, and
are accreting close to the Eddington limit (L_Bol/L_Edd=0.13-1.2). We
investigate the ionized regions around the quasars and find near zone radii of
R_NZ=1.5-5.2 proper Mpc, confirming the trend of decreasing near zone sizes
with increasing redshift found for quasars at 5.7<z<6.4. By combining R_NZ of
the PS1 quasars with those of 5.7<z<7.1 quasars in the literature, we derive a
luminosity corrected redshift evolution of
R_NZ,corrected=(7.2+/-0.2)-(6.1+/-0.7)x(z-6) Mpc. However, the large spread in
R_NZ in the new quasars implies a wide range in quasar ages and/or a large
variation in the neutral Hydrogen fraction along different lines of sight.

point particle is infinite. This makes classical mass renormalization necessary
and, in the special relativistic domain, leads to the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac
equation of motion possessing unphysical run-away and pre-acceleration
solutions. In this paper we investigate whether the higher-order modification
of classical vacuum electrodynamics suggested by Bopp, Lande, Thomas and
Podolsky in the 1940s, can provide a solution to this problem. Since the theory
is linear, Green-function techniques enable one to write the field of a charged
point particle on Minkowski spacetime as an integral over the particle's
history. By introducing the notion of timelike worldlines that are ""bounded
away from the backward light-cone"" we are able to prescribe criteria for the
convergence of such integrals. We also exhibit a timelike worldline yielding
singular fields on a lightlike hyperplane in spacetime. In this case the field
is mildly singular at the event where the particle crosses the hyperplane. Even
in the case when the Bopp-Podolsky field is bounded, it exhibits a directional
discontinuity as one approaches the point particle. We describe a procedure for
assigning a value to the field on the particle worldline which enables one to
define a finite Lorentz self-force. This is explicitly derived leading to an
integro-differential equation for the motion of the particle in an external
electromagnetic field. We conclude that any worldline solutions to this
equation belonging to the categories discussed in the paper have continuous
4-velocities.

model of ocean water on Enceladus. The model indicates that Enceladus' ocean is
a Na-Cl-CO3 solution with an alkaline pH of ~11-12. The dominance of aqueous
NaCl is a feature that Enceladus' ocean shares with terrestrial seawater, but
the ubiquity of dissolved Na2CO3 suggests that soda lakes are more analogous to
the Enceladus ocean. The high pH implies that the hydroxide ion should be
relatively abundant, while divalent metals should be present at low
concentrations owing to buffering by clays and carbonates on the ocean floor.
The high pH is interpreted to be a key consequence of serpentinization of
chondritic rock, as predicted by prior geochemical reaction path models;
although degassing of CO2 from the ocean may also play a role depending on the
efficiency of mixing processes in the ocean. Serpentinization leads to the
generation of H2, a geochemical fuel that can support both abiotic and
biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected
in Enceladus' plume. Serpentinization and H2 generation should have occurred on
Enceladus, like on the parent bodies of aqueously altered meteorites; but it is
unknown whether these critical processes are still taking place, or if
Enceladus' rocky core has been completely altered by past hydrothermal
activity. The high pH also suggests that the delivery of oxidants from the
surface to the ocean has not been significant, and the rocky core did not
experience partial melting and igneous differentiation. On the other hand, the
pH is compatible with life as we know it; life on Earth may have begun under
similar conditions, and serpentinites on Earth support microbial communities
that are centered on H2 that is provided by water-rock reactions.

wide range of parameters. First, to clarify the nature of spin-excitations, we
introduce a soluble spin-1 model, and use this to derive a continuum field
theory, applicable to any two-sublattice spin-nematic state. We then
parameterise this field theory, using diagrammatic calculations for a realistic

show quantitative predictions for inelastic scattering of neutrons from

the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that
even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets' rotation away
from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that
predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the
amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable
Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than

photonic cavity can significantly enhance its spontaneous emission rate through
cavity quantum electrodynamics in the Purcell regime. This effect can greatly
reduce the lasing threshold of the emitter, providing the ultimate
low-threshold laser system with small footprint, low power consumption and
ultrafast modulation. A state-of-the-art ultra-low threshold nanolaser has been
successfully developed though embedding quantum dots into photonic crystal
cavity (PhCC). However, several core challenges impede the practical
applications of this architecture, including the random positions and
compositional fluctuations of the dots, extreme difficulty in current
injection, and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits. Here, we report
a new strategy to lase, where atomically thin crystalline semiconductor, i.e.,
a tungsten-diselenide (WSe2) monolayer, is nondestructively and
deterministically introduced as a gain medium at the surface of a
pre-fabricated PhCC. A new type of continuous-wave nanolaser operating in the
visible regime is achieved with an optical pumping threshold as low as 27 nW at
130 K, similar to the value achieved in quantum dot PhCC lasers. The key to the
lasing action lies in the monolayer nature of the gain medium, which confines
direct-gap excitons to within 1 nm of the PhCC surface. The surface-gain
geometry allows unprecedented accessibilities to multi-functionalize the gain,
enabling electrically pumped operation. Our scheme is scalable and compatible
with integrated photonics for on-chip optical communication technologies.

  Spatial Aggregation Error",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known
problems that occur when modeling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate
how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a
spatial domain of interest. By ""regionalization"" we mean a specification of
geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been
studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial
statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error
(CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE
we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale
representation of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between
CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical
developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared
prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin
eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an
analysis of two datasets, one using the American Community Survey and one
related to environmental ocean winds.

radii are consistent with the inferred lower limit to the sublimation radius
for pure graphite grains at 1800 K, but smaller by a factor of ~ 2 than the

the shear viscosity coefficient over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ in the

value of $\eta/s$ increases with decreasing collision energy, which may
indicate that $\eta/s$ of the quark-gluon plasma depends on baryochemical

the growth of its size with the molecular phonon frequency $\omega_0$. We find
additional phases enfolding the base boundary of the intermediate phase. A

to examine the thermodynamic processes associated with varying the input
parameters of the PFC model: temperature, lattice spacing, and the average
value of the PFC order parameter, $\bar{n}$. The equilibrium conditions between
bulk crystalline solid and liquid phases are imposed on the thermodynamic
relationships for the PFC model to obtain a procedure for determining
solid-liquid phase coexistence. The resulting procedure is found to be in
agreement with the method commonly used in the PFC community, justifying the
use of the common-tangent construction to determine solid-liquid phase
coexistence in the PFC model. Finally, we apply the procedure to an
eighth-order-fit (EOF) PFC model that has been parameterized to
body-centered-cubic ($bcc$) Fe [Jaatinen et al., Physical Review E 80, 031602

predict the flux variability of $\theta$ Aur from the emerging intensities
calculated for individual surface elements of the star taking into account
horizontal variation of chemical composition derived from Doppler abundance
maps. The simulated optical variability in the Str\""omgren photometric system
and the ultraviolet flux variability agree well with observations. The IUE flux
distribution is reproduced in great detail by our models. The resonance lines
of magnesium and possibly also some lines of silicon are relatively weak in the
ultraviolet domain, which indicates non-negligible vertical abundance gradients
in the atmosphere. We also derive a new period of the star, $P=3.618\,664(10)$
d, from all available photometric and magnetic measurements and show that the
observed rotational period is constant over decades. The ultraviolet and visual
variability of $\theta$ Aur is mostly caused by silicon bound-free absorption
and chromium and iron line absorption. These elements redistribute the flux
mainly from the far-ultraviolet region to the near-ultraviolet and optical
regions in the surface abundance spots. The light variability is modulated by

for the signal to noise $\lambda/\sigma$ ratio in terms of $m$, $n$, $k_m$, and

boundary. Below this threshold, it is shown that no polynomial time algorithm
can succeed in identifying the submatrix, under the \textit{hidden clique

identify the submatrix with high probability when the signal strength is above
the threshold $\sf SNR_c$. The second threshold, $\sf SNR_s$, captures the
statistical boundary, below which no method can succeed with probability going
to one in the minimax sense. The exhaustive search method successfully finds
the submatrix above this threshold. The results show an interesting phenomenon

expected for secondary N production, suggesting a delay in the release of the
secondary N or a tertiary N production mechanism. We constrain the electron
density using Si II* and C II* absorption. We also report different metallicity

detections of emission lines from the underlying galaxies, our measurements of

the problem of the free particle, and how that affected decisively the

all the questions which still prevail nowadays, were then already posed. Except

are equivalent modulo a set of permutation of rules that reflects the
commutative conversions of its cut-elimination procedure. As such, it is
related to the question of proofnets: finding canonical representatives of
equivalence classes of proofs that have good computational properties. It can
also be seen as the word problem for the notion of free category corresponding
to the logic.
  It has been recently shown that proof equivalence in MLL (the multiplicative
with units fragment of linear logic) is PSPACE-complete, which rules out any
low-complexity notion of proofnet for this particular logic.
  Since it is another fragment of linear logic for which attempts to define a
fully satisfactory low-complexity notion of proofnet have not been successful
so far, we study proof equivalence in MALL- (multiplicative-additive without
units fragment of linear logic) and discover a situation that is totally
different from the MLL case. Indeed, we show that proof equivalence in MALL-
corresponds (under AC0 reductions) to equivalence of binary decision diagrams,
a data structure widely used to represent and analyze Boolean functions
efficiently.
  We show these two equivalent problems to be LOGSPACE-complete. If this
technically leaves open the possibility for a complete solution to the question
of proofnets for MALL-, the established relation with binary decision diagrams
actually suggests a negative solution to this problem.

metabolic features. Most brown algae grow along the coastal zone where they
face frequent environmental changes, including exposure to toxic levels of
heavy metals such as copper (Cu). We carried out large-scale transcriptomic and
metabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of the brown algal
model E. siliculosus to Cu stress, and compared these data to results known for
other abiotic stressors. This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative
stress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between
Cu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the
activation of the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways,
together with the regulation of genes coding for several
transcription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically
activated a set of genes coding for orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type
ATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent
bromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally
we observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic
processes on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen
assimilation on the other hand. Comparisons with data from green plants
indicate that some processes involved in Cu and oxidative stress response are
conserved across these two distant lineages. At the same time the high number
of yet uncharacterized brown alga-specific genes induced in response to copper
stress underlines the potential to discover new components and molecular
interactions unique to these organisms. Of particular interest for future
research is the potential cross-talk between reactive oxygen species (ROS)-,

neutrinos toward a detector placed in South Dakota. The neutrinos are produced
in a three-step process. First, protons from the Main Injector hit a solid
target and produce mesons. Then, the charged mesons are focused by a set of
focusing horns into the decay pipe, towards the far detector. Finally, the
mesons that enter the decay pipe decay into neutrinos. The parameters of the
facility were determined by an amalgam of the physics goals, the Monte Carlo
modeling of the facility, and the experience gained by operating the NuMI

some of the parameters were chosen to be able to deal with a beam power of 2.3

The capacity of quantum computational models to operate on a superposition of

measurement of an equivalent halt qubit would have the potential to inherently
interfere with the computation by provoking a random collapse amongst the

the final result of a computation; (2) the possibility of non-terminating

uncertainty affecting black hole mass determinations is the structure of the

linear inversion (RLI) that includes modelling of the AGN continuum light
curves. This enables fast calculation of velocity-resolved response maps to
constrain BLR structure. RLI allows for negative response, such as when some
areas of the BLR respond in inverse proportion to a change in ionizing
continuum luminosity. We present time delays, integrated response functions,
and velocity-delay maps for the $\rm{H}\,\beta$ broad emission line in five
nearby AGN, as well as for $\rm{H}\,\alpha$ and $\rm{H}\,\gamma$ in Arp 151,

second narrow response at 10 days. We find no clear indications of negative
response. The results are complementary to, and consistent with, other methods
such as cross correlation, maximum entropy and dynamical modelling. Regularized
linear inversion with continuum light curve modelling provides a fast,
complementary method for velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and is

Angstrom [OIII] emission lines, and the absence of significant continuum. We
implement a robust technique to measure the halo velocity dispersion from the
projected phase-space to identify PNs associated with the M87 halo and ICL. The
velocity distribution of the spectroscopically confirmed PNs is bimodal,
containing a narrow component centred on the systemic velocity of the BCG and
an off-centred broader component, that we identify as halo and ICL,
respectively. Halo and ICPN have different spatial distributions: the halo PNs
follow the galaxy's light, whereas the ICPNs are characterised by a shallower
power-law profile. The composite PN number density profile shows the
superposition of different PN populations associated with the M87 halo and the
ICL, characterised by different PN alpha-parameters, the ICL contributing ~3
times more PNs per unit light. Down to m_5007=28.8, the M87 halo PN luminosity
function (PNLF) has a steeper slope towards faint magnitudes than the IC PNLF,
and both are steeper than the standard PNLF for the M31 bulge. Moreover, the IC
PNLF has a dip at ~1-1.5 mag fainter than the bright cutoff, reminiscent of the
PNLFs of systems with extended star formation history. The M87 halo and the
Virgo ICL are dynamically distinct components with different density profiles
and velocity distribution. The different alpha values and PNLF shapes of the
halo and ICL indicate distinct parent stellar populations, consistent with the
existence of a gradient towards bluer colours at large radii. These results

in the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association at a distance of 122.7 +16.2 -12.8
parsec. The extended disk has been detected to ~1.5"" (200 AU) at 11.7 {\mu}m
and 18.3 {\mu}m with T-ReCS on Gemini South. The disk is inclined at an angle
of ~75{\deg} with the position angle of ~61{\deg}. The flux of HD 131835 system
is 49.3+-7.6 mJy and 84+-45 mJy at 11.7 {\mu}m and 18.3 {\mu}m respectively. A
model with three grain populations gives a satisfactory fit to both the
spectral energy distribution and the images simultaneously. This best-fit model
is composed of a hot continuous power-law disk and two rings. We characterized
the grain temperature profile and found that the grains in all three
populations are emitting at temperatures higher than blackbodies. In
particular, the grains in the continuous disk are unusually warm; even when
considering small graphite particles as the composition.

on the ~200 pc scales of interest for classical and ultra-faint dwarfs in the
Local Group. The resultant galaxies sit on the $M_*$ vs. $M_{v}$ relation
required to match the Local Group stellar mass function. They have bursty star
formation histories and also form with half-light radii and metallicities that
broadly match those observed for local dwarfs at the same stellar mass. We
demonstrate that it is possible to create a large (~1 kpc) dark matter core in
a cosmological simulation of an $M_*\simeq10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxy that
resides within an $M_{v}=10^{10}M_{\odot}$ halo -- precisely the scale of
interest for resolving the Too Big to Fail problem. However, these large cores
are not ubiquitous and appear to correlate closely with the star formation
histories of the dwarfs: dark matter cores are largest in systems that form
their stars late ($z\lesssim2$), after the early epoch of cusp building mergers
has ended. Our $M_*\simeq10^4M_{\odot}$ dwarf retains a cuspy dark matter halo
density profile that matches almost identically that of a dark-matter only run
of the same system. Despite forming in a field environment, this very low mass
dwarf has observable properties that match closely to those of ultra-faint
satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, including a uniformly old stellar
population (>10 Gyr). Though ancient, most of the stars in our ultra-faint form
after reionization; the UV field acts mainly to suppress fresh gas accretion,
not to boil away gas that is already present in the proto-dwarf.

tidally disrupted, if the tidal forces due to the supermassive black hole
(SMBH) residing there overcome the self-gravity of the star. If the star is
only partially disrupted, so that a fraction survives as a self-bound object,
this remaining core will experience a net gain in specific orbital energy,
which translates into a velocity ""kick"" of up to $\sim 10^3$ km/s. In this
paper, we present the result of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations of such partial disruptions, and analyse the velocity kick imparted
on the surviving core. We compare $\gamma$ = 5/3 and $\gamma$ = 4/3 polytropes
disrupted in both a Newtonian potential, and a generalized potential that
reproduces most relativistic effects around a Schwarzschild black hole either
exactly or to excellent precision. For the Newtonian case, we confirm the
results of previous studies that the kick velocity of the surviving core is
virtually independent of the ratio of the black hole to stellar mass, and is a
function of the impact parameter $\beta$ alone, reaching at most the escape
velocity of the original star. For a given $\beta$, relativistic effects become
increasingly important for larger black hole masses. In particular, we find
that the kick velocity increases with the black hole mass, making larger kicks
more common than in the Newtonian case, as low-$\beta$ encounters are
statistically more likely than high-$\beta$ encounters. The analysis of the
tidal tensor for the generalized potential shows that our results are robust
lower limits on the true relativistic kick velocities, and are generally in
very good agreement with the exact results.

Gravitational collapse theory and numerical simulations suggest that
the velocity field within large-scale galaxy filaments is dominated by motions
along the filaments.
  Aims. Our aim is to check whether observational data reveal any preferred
orientation of galaxy pairs with respect to the underlying filaments as a
result of the expectedly anisotropic velocity field.
  Methods. We use galaxy pairs and galaxy filaments identified from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey data. For filament extraction, we use the Bisous model that
is based the marked point process technique. During the filament detection, we
use the centre point of each pair instead of the positions of galaxies to avoid
a built-in influence of pair orientation on the filament construction. For
pairs lying within filaments (3012 cases), we calculate the angle between the
line connecting galaxies of each pair and their host filament. To avoid
redshift-space distortions, the angle is measured in the plain of the sky.
  Results. The alignment analysis shows that the orientation of galaxy pairs
correlates strongly with their host filaments. The alignment signal is stronger
for loose pairs, with at least 25% excess of aligned pairs compared to a random
distribution. The alignment of galaxy pairs and filaments measured from the
observational data is in good concordance with the alignment in the Millennium
simulation and thus provides support to the {\Lambda}CDM formalism.

dissociation in presence of the d-band of a metal catalyst can be described as
a Quantum Dynamical Phase Transition (QDPT). This agree with DFT calculations

to our model this phenomenon emerges because the catalyst provides for a non-

as occurs in the Heyrovsky reaction of H 2, the bonding H 2 orbital has a
smooth crossover into a bonding molecular orbital built with the closest H
orbital and the surface metal d-states. The same occurs for the antibonding

d- band which are associated with bonding and antibonding orbitals between the
furthest H atom and the d-states at the second metallic layer. These move
towards the band center where they collapse into a pure metallic resonance and

the non-trivial physics enabled when one deals with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian

from $\sim$10% at $k<0.2 h $Mpc$^{-1}$ to 25% at $k\sim0.45h$Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z =
0$. Both the stochastic relation and nonlinearity are more pronounced for
halos, $M \le 5 \times 10^{12}M_\odot h^{-1}$, compared to the dark matter at
$z=0$ and $1$. Nonlinear growth effects manifest themselves as a rotation of
the mean $< \theta|\delta>$ away from the linear theory prediction $-f_{\tiny
\rm LT}\delta$, where $f_{\tiny \rm LT}$ is the linear growth rate. This
rotation increases with wavenumber, $k$, and we show that it can be
well-described by second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) for $k <
0.1 h$Mpc$^{-1}$. The stochasticity in the $\theta$ -- $\delta$ relation is not
so simply described by 2LPT, and we discuss its impact on measurements of
$f_{\tiny \rm LT}$ from two point statistics in redshift space. Given that the
relationship between $\delta$ and $\theta$ is stochastic and nonlinear, this
will have implications for the interpretation and precision of $f_{\tiny \rm
LT}$ extracted using models which assume a linear, deterministic expression.

maximum RF gradient in a vacuum RF cavity is strongly limited by an external

is functional of generating a high RF accelerating gradient in a strong
magnetic field and making an ionization cooling process at the same time. A
critical issue of the cavity is a beam- induced plasma that consumes a
considerable amount of RF power. The gas filled RF test cell was made and
measured the RF loading due to a beam-induced plasma by using an intense proton

most severe impacts are during the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME)
when the magnetosphere is both compressed and magnetically connected to the
heliospheric environment. Unfortunately, forecasting magnetic vectors within
coronal mass ejections remains elusive. Here we report how, by combining a
statistically robust helicity rule for a CME's solar origin with a simplified

investigate the hypothesis that culture evolves more effectively when
novelty-generating creative processes are tempered by imitation processes that
preserve proven successful ideas. Using EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural
evolution we found that (1) the optimal ratio of inventing to imitating ranged
from 1:1 to 2:1 depending on the fitness function, (2) there was a trade-off
between the proportion of creators to conformers and how creative the creators
were, and (3) when agents in increased or decreased their creativity depending
on the success of their latest creative efforts, they segregated into creators
and conformers, and the mean fitness of ideas across the society was higher. It
is tentatively suggested that through the unconscious use of social cues,
members of a society self-organizes to achieve a balanced mix of creators and
conformers.

most of the systems have periods less than 2 hours, only one has a period in
the 80-86 minute 'spike' found by Gaensicke et al. (2009), and 11 have periods
longer than 3 hours, indicating that the present sample is skewed toward
longer-period, higher-luminosity objects. Seven of the objects have spectra
resembling dwarf novae, but have apparently never been observed in outburst,
suggesting that many cataclysmics with relatively low variability amplitude
remain to be discovered. Some of the objects are notable. SDSS J07568+0858 and
SDSS J08129+1911 were previously known to have deep eclipses; in addition to
spectroscopy, we use archival data from the CRTTS to refine their periods. We
give a parallax-based distance of 195 (+54, -39) pc for LV Cnc (SDSS
J09197+0857), which at Porb = 81 m has the shortest orbital period in our
sample. SDSS J08091+3814 shows both the spectroscopic phase offset and
phase-dependent absorption found in SW Sextantis stars. The average spectra of
SDSS J08055+0720 and SDSS J16191+1351 show contributions from K-type
secondaries, and SDSS J080440+0239 shows a contribution from an early M star.

typical of a magnetic system. SDSS11324+6249 may be a novalike variable, and if

presence of these correlations is manisfested through distinct interference

These novel forms of interference correspond to the azimuthal analog of the

importance in applications where entanglement is not required and where
correlations in angular position and orbital angular momentum suffice. We also

instances leads the maximum coupling strength to increase with problem size. As
a result, larger instances are subject to amplified analog control error, and
are effectively annealed at higher temperatures in both hardware and software.
We generate similar constraint satisfaction instances with limited range of
coupling strength and perform a similar comparison to classical algorithms. On
these instances the D-Wave Vesuvius processor, run with a fixed 20$\mu$s anneal
time, shows a scaling advantage over the software solvers for the hardest
regime studied. This scaling advantage opens the possibility of quantum speedup
on these problems. Our results support the hypothesis that performance of
D-Wave Vesuvius processors is heavily influenced by analog control error, which
can be reduced and mitigated as the technology matures.

at demonstrating the gain provided by Wide-Field Adaptive Optics instruments to
study young clusters. We used deep, JHKs images from the newly commissioned
Gemini-GeMS/GSAOI instrument, complemented with Spitzer IRAC observations, in
order to study the photometric properties of the young stellar cluster. GeMS is
an AO instrument, delivering almost diffraction limited images over a field of
2' across. The exquisite angular resolution allows us to reach a limiting
magnitude of J = 22 for 98% completeness. The combination of the IRAC
photometry with our JHKs catalog is used to build color-color diagrams, and
select Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) candidates. We detect the presence of 80
Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates. Those YSOs are used to infer the cluster
age, which is found to be in the range 1 to 5 Myr. We find that 1/3 of the YSOs
are in a range between 3 to 5 Myr, while 2/3 of the YSO are < 3 Myr. When
looking at the spatial distribution of these two populations, we evidence a
potential age gradient across the field, suggesting sequential star formation.
We construct the IMF, and show that we can sample the mass distribution well
into the brown dwarf regime (down to 0.01 Msun). The logarithmic mass function
rises to peak at 0.3 Msun, before turning over and declining into the brown
dwarf regime. The total cluster mass derived is estimated to be 78 +/- 18 Msun,
while the ratio of brown dwarfs to star derived is 18 p/- 5 %. When comparing
with other young clusters, we find that the IMF shape of the young cluster
embedded within RCW 41 is consistent with those of Trapezium, IC 348 or
Chamaeleon I, except for the IMF peak, which happens to be at higher mass. This
characteristic is also seen in clusters like NGC 6611 or even Taurus.

the possibility to be stalled at certain position of the transcription
template. This may be due to the template damage, or protein barriers. Once
stalled, polymerase may backtrack along the template to the previous nucleotide
to wait for the repair of the damaged site, or simply bypass the barrier or
damaged site and consequently synthesize an incorrect messenger RNA, or degrade
and detach from the template. Thus, the {\it effective} transcription rate (the
rate to synthesize correct product mRNA) and the transcription {\it
effectiveness} (the ratio of the {\it effective} transcription rate to the {\it
effective} transcription initiation rate) are both influenced by polymerase
stalling events. This study shows that, Without backtracking, detachment of
stalled polymerase can also help to increase the {\it effective} transcription
rate and transcription {\it effectiveness}. Generally, the increase of bypass
rate of the stalled polymerase will lead to the decrease of the {\it effective}
transcription rate and transcription {\it effectiveness}. But when both
detachment rate and backtracking rate of the stalled polymerase vanish, the
{\it effective} transcription rate may also be increased by the bypass
mechanism.

  Support Techniques","Book Draft",,,,"cs.MA cs.CY cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowdsourcing refers to the arrangement in which contributions are solicited
from a large group of unrelated people. Due to this nature, crowdsourcers (or
task requesters) often face uncertainty about the workers' capabilities which,
in turn, affects the quality and timeliness of the results obtained. Trust is a
mechanism used by people to facilitate interactions in human societies where
risk and uncertain are common. The crucial challenge to building a robust
crowdsourcing system is how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to
efficiently utilize the capacities of workers (or trustee agents) to achieve
high social welfare?
  This book presents the research addressing this challenge. It goes beyond the
existing trust management research framework by removing a widespread
assumption implicitly adopted by existing research: that a trustee agent can
process an unlimited number of interaction requests per discrete time unit
without compromising its performance as perceived by the task requesters (or
truster agents). Decision support in crowdsourcing is re-formalized as a
multi-agent trust game based on the principles of the Congestion Game, which is
solved by two trust-aware interaction decision-making approaches: 1) the Social
Welfare Optimizing approach for Reputation-aware Decision-making (SWORD)
approach, and 2) the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair
utilization of Trustee agents (DRAFT). SWORD is designed for centralized
systems, while DRAFT is designed for fully distributed systems. Theoretical
analyses have shown that the social welfare produced by these two approaches
can be made closer to optimal by adjusting only one key parameter. With these
two approaches, the framework of research for crowdsourcing systems can be
enriched to handle more realistic scenarios where workers have varied and
limited capabilities.

produce necessary proteins for cell growth. Numerious experiments have been
performed to explore the translational properties. Diverse models have also
been developed to determine the biochemical mechanism of translation. However,
to simplify the majority of the existing models, the frameshifting of ribosome
along the mRNA transcript is neglected, which actually occurs in real cells and
has been extensively experimentally studied. The frameshifting of ribosome
evidently influences the efficiency and speed of translation, considering that
the peptide chains synthesized by shifted ribosomes will not fold into
functional proteins and will degrade rapidly. In this study, a theoretical
model is presented to describe the translational process based on the model for
totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. In this model, the frameshifting
of the ribosome along the mRNA transcript and the attachment/detachment of the
ribosome to/from the main body of mRNA codons during translation elongation
process, are explicitly included. The results show that, with ribosome
frameshifing, the speed of correctly synthesized peptide chains may increase
first and then decrease with both the translation initiation rate $\alpha$ and
the ribosome detachment rate $\omega_d$. This results indicates that regulating
the translation process to reach maximal synthesized speed of proteins is
theoretically feasible. Traffic-related problems of ribosome motion along the
mRNA transcript are also addressed theoretically. Depending on parameter
values, shock wave (or domain wall) may exist for ribosome probabilities along
the mRNA.

with only a single path connecting various nodes would have been debilitatingly
fragile. Unfortunately, traditional Internet technologies have been designed
around the restrictive assumption of a single working path between a source and
a destination. The lack of native multipath support constrains network
performance even as the underlying network is richly connected and has
redundant multiple paths. Computer networks can exploit the power of
multiplicity to unlock the inherent redundancy of the Internet. This opens up a
new vista of opportunities promising increased throughput (through concurrent
usage of multiple paths) and increased reliability and fault-tolerance (through
the use of multiple paths in backup/ redundant arrangements). There are many
emerging trends in networking that signify that the Internet's future will be
unmistakably multipath, including the use of multipath technology in datacenter
computing; multi-interface, multi-channel, and multi-antenna trends in
wireless; ubiquity of mobile devices that are multi-homed with heterogeneous
access networks; and the development and standardization of multipath transport
protocols such as MP-TCP.

of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in both temperature and
polarization based on the full Planck survey. The Planck full mission
temperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angular
scales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be
$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to
$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the Planck lensing
likelihood. When the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results are
consistent and uncertainties are reduced. The upper bound on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} < 0.11$ (95% CL), consistent with the
B-mode polarization constraint $r< 0.12$ (95% CL) obtained from a joint
BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck analysis. These results imply that $V(\phi)
\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to models
predicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $R^2$ inflation. Three
independent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum are
investigated. The Planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordial
perturbations. We investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropic

built with different strength of the bias potential exploiting the tunability
of well-tempered metadynamics. Using this method, free-energy barriers of
individual collective variables are significantly reduced compared with simple
force-field scaling. The introduced methodology is flexible and allows adaptive
bias potentials to be self-consistently constructed for a large number of
simple collective variables, such as distances and dihedral angles. The method

Fermi-surface instability in the parent metallic phase. While phonon-electron
coupling has been suggested to influence the formation of CDW order in
quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) systems, the presumed dominant importance of
Fermi-surface nesting remains largely unquestioned in quasi-1D systems. Here we
show that phonon-electron coupling is also important for the CDW formation in a
model quasi-1D system ZrTe$_3$. Our joint experimental and computational study
reveals that particular lattice vibrational patterns possess exceedingly strong
coupling to the conduction electrons, and are directly linked to the lattice
distortions associated with the CDW order. The dependence of the coupling
matrix elements on electron momentum further dictates the opening of (partial)
electronic gaps in the CDW phase. Since lattice distortions and electronic gaps
are the defining signatures of CDW order, our result demonstrates that the
conventional wisdom based on Fermi-surface geometry needs to be substantially
supplemented by phonon-electron coupling even in the simplest quasi-1D case. As
prerequisites for the CDW formation, the highly anisotropic electronic
structure and strong phonon-electron coupling in ZrTe$_3$ give rise to a
distinct Raman scattering effect, namely, measured phonon linewidths depend on
the direction of momentum transfer in the scattering process.

consumers are exhibiting diverse preferences for content; their preferences
often depend on the context in which they consume content as well as various
exogenous events. To satisfy the consumers' demand for such diverse content,
multimedia content aggregators (CAs) have emerged which gather content from
numerous multimedia sources. A key challenge for such systems is to accurately
predict what type of content each of its consumers prefers in a certain

Since both the multimedia content characteristics and the consumers'

learn online what content to gather and how to match content and users by
exploiting similarities between consumer types. We prove bounds for our

efficiently even when feedback from consumers is missing or content and

utilization of available cache space. On the other hand, efficient use of
network-wide cache space requires possible cooperation among caching routers
without the use of excessive signaling burden. While most of the cache

efficiency, we have taken a different path in this work and improved the
storage efficiency of the cache space so that it is utilized to its most.
  In this work we discuss the ICN caching problem, and propose a novel
distributed architecture to efficiently use the network-wide cache storage
space based on distributed caching. The proposal achieves cache retention
efficiency by means of controlled traffic redirection and selective caching. We
utilize the ICN mechanisms and routing protocol messages for decision making,

distributed antenna multiuser networks with full-duplex (FD) radio base
stations (BSs) which enable simultaneous uplink and downlink communications.
The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as an
optimization problem taking into account the antenna circuit power consumption
of the BSs and the quality of service (QoS) requirements of both uplink and
downlink users. We minimize the total network power consumption by jointly
optimizing the downlink beamformer, the uplink transmit power, and the antenna
selection. To overcome the intractability of the resulting problem, we
reformulate it as an optimization problem with decoupled binary selection
variables and non-convex constraints. The reformulated problem facilitates the
design of an iterative resource allocation algorithm which obtains an optimal
solution based on the generalized Bender's decomposition (GBD) and serves as a
benchmark scheme. Furthermore, to strike a balance between computational
complexity and system performance, a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial time
complexity is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD
based iterative algorithm converges to the global optimal solution and the
suboptimal algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance. Our results also
demonstrate the trade-off between power efficiency and the number of active
transmit antennas when the circuit power consumption is taken into account. In
particular, activating an exceedingly large number of antennas may not be a
power efficient solution for reducing the total system power consumption. In
addition, our results reveal that FD systems facilitate significant power
savings compared to traditional half-duplex systems, despite the non-negligible

time. The recently obtained data has proved that several fast vibration of beam
envelope along the diameter direction occur during the rising edge and the
falling edge of the electron beam. The vibration period is about several
nanoseconds. The effect of magnetic field on the electron beam is also observed
and verified. The beam debug experiments have proved that the existing beam

  Surfaces",,,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Marching surfaces is a method for isosurface extraction and approximation
based on a $G^1$ multi-sided patch interpolation scheme. Given a 3D grid of
scalar values, an underlying curve network is formed using second order
information and cubic Hermite splines. Circular arc fitting defines the tangent
vectors for the Hermite curves at specified isovalues. Once the boundary curve
network is formed, a loop of curves is determined for each grid cell and then
interpolated with multi-sided surface patches, which are $G^1$ continuous at
the joins. The data economy of the method and its continuity preserving
properties provide an effective compression scheme, ideal for indirect volume
rendering on mobile devices, or collaborating on the Internet, while enhancing
visual fidelity. The use of multi-sided patches enables a more natural way to
approximate the isosurfaces than using a fixed number of sides or polygons as
is proposed in the literature. This assertion is supported with comparisons to
the traditional Marching Cubes algorithm and other $G^1$ methods.

an exact solution to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation which accounts for
dynamics of the wave packet, and show that this solution is physically correct

Of course the well-established properties of the Zeta Function, explored in

approach starts from the recognized necessity of formulating an extension of
the Zeta Function which is defined for Re(s) = X < 1. A particular form of
extension, based on a Euler-McLaurin integration procedure, is chosen and an
algebraic appraisal is made of the conditions required to make the expression
of this extension equal to zero. Imposing the zero-condition on this extension
of the Zeta Function implies the nullity of the sum of three terms with
different properties. This can be obtained only if certain compatibility
conditions between the three terms are satisfied. One of the terms is endowed
with a high degree of symmetry with respect to the Critical Line (C.L.) X =
1/2, and from the compatibility conditions it follows that either the other two
terms possess the same type of symmetry or any complex-conjugate (c.c.) pair of
zero-points should lie on the C.L. Since the symmetry properties of the first

evaluated by introducing a wedge between the two YSZ adherands so that the
stored energy in the thin YSZ cantilever beam drives a stable crack in the
adhesive bond and allows the critical energy release rate for crack extension
(fracture toughness) to be measured. The crack path in most specimens showed a
mixture of adhesive failure (at the YSZ-LSCF interface) and cohesive failure
(within the LSCF). It was found that the extent of adhesive fracture increased
with firing temperature and decreased with LSCF layer thickness. The adhesive

toughness appears to have a strong dependence on firing temperature. However,
the intrinsic adhesive fracture toughness of the LSCF/YSZ interface was

likely ones to be of extraterrestrial origin. Even excluding the PeV events
detected so far, the neutrino flux is well above the atmospheric background, so
it is likely that a number of sub-PeV events originate from the same
astrophysical sources that produce the PeV events. We study the high-energy
properties of AGN that are positionally coincident with the neutrino events
from three years of IceCube data and show the results for event number 4. IC 4

construct broadband spectra and present parametrizations of the broadband
spectral energy distributions with logarithmic parabolas. Assuming the X-ray to
{\gamma}-ray emission in blazars originates in the photoproduction of pions by
accelerated protons, their predicted neutrino luminosity can be estimated. The
measurements of the diffuse extragalactic background by Fermi/LAT gives us an
estimate of the flux contributions from faint unresolved blazars. Their
contribution increases the number of expected events by a factor of $\sim$2. We
conclude that the detection of the IceCube neutrinos IC4, IC14, and IC20 can be

were investigated by nanoindentation. The elastic modulus of the bulk samples
was found to increase from 33.8 to 174.3 GPa and hardness from 0.64 to 5.32 GPa
as the porosity decreased from 0.45 to 0.05 after sintering at 900 to 1200C. It
was shown that reliable measurements of the true properties of the films were
obtained provided that the effects from both surface roughness and substrate

to film thickness ratio. The fracture toughnesses of bulk LSCF were determined
to increase from 0.51 to 0.99 MPam0.5. The microstructures of films were

agreed well with the nanoindentation results. The 3D microstructures were
numerically modified at constant porosity using cellular automaton method, so
that the influence on elastic modulus of factors other than porosity could be

for the purpose of designing robust feedback controllers. This is challenging
since whilst many flows are governed by a set of nonlinear, partial
differential-algebraic equations (the Navier-Stokes equations), the majority of
established control theory assumes models of much greater simplicity, in that
they are firstly: linear, secondly: described by ordinary differential
equations, and thirdly: finite-dimensional. Linearisation, where appropriate,
overcomes the first disparity, but attempts to reconcile the remaining two have
proved difficult. This paper addresses these two problems as follows. Firstly,
a numerical approach is used to project the governing equations onto a
divergence-free basis, thus converting a system of differential-algebraic
equations into one of ordinary differential equations. This dispenses with the
need for analytical velocity-vorticity transformations, and thus simplifies the
modelling of boundary sensing and actuation. Secondly, this paper presents a
novel and straightforward approach for obtaining suitable low-order models of
fluid flows, from which robust feedback controllers can be synthesised that
provide a priori guarantees of robust performance when connected to the
(infinite-dimensional) linearised flow system. This approach overcomes many of
the problems inherent in approaches that rely upon model-reduction. To
illustrate these methods, a perturbation shear stress controller is designed
and applied to plane channel flow, assuming arrays of wall mounted shear-stress
sensors and transpiration actuators. DNS results demonstrate robust attenuation
of the perturbation shear-stresses across a wide range of Reynolds numbers with
a single, linear controller.

then studied as a function of the rectangle sides lengths a and b=1/a, and the
radius r used to connect the nodes. When a=1 we recover the RGG, and when
a-->infinity the very elongated rectangle generated resembles a one-dimensional
RGG. We obtain here analytical expressions for the average degree, degree
distribution, connectivity, average path length and clustering coefficient for
RRG. These results provide evidence that show that most of these properties
depend on the connection radius and the side length of the rectangle, usually
in a monotonic way. The clustering coefficient, however, increases when the
square is transformed into a slightly elongated rectangle, and after this
maximum it decays with the increase of the elongation of the rectangle. We
support all our findings by computational simulations that show the goodness of

Western Compilation, Deval, and Nagoji Row in Hindustani music. A generalized
mathematical function for Shrutis has also been formulated. This generalized
function shows a very high order of conformity with the experimentally derived
Shruti distribution, than those of the theoretical Shruti distributions.

tilts the scalar, not the light cone, in 2+1-dimensions. The topological metric
is static, regular and it is characterized by an integer $\kappa =\pm 1,\pm
2,...$. The problem is formulated as a harmonic map of Riemannian manifolds in
which the integer $\kappa $ equals to the degree of the map.

eigenfunctions into electronic, vibrational, and rotational parts, but at the
end of their paper showed that the two angles describing rotation of the nuclei
in a diatomic molecule are exactly separable. A year later in a two-part work
devoted strictly to diatomic molecules, Wigner and Witmer published (1) an
exact diatomic eigenfunction and (2) the rules correlating the electronic state
of a diatomic molecule to the orbital and spin momenta of the separated atoms.
The second part of the Wigner-Witmer paper became famous for its correlation
rules, but, oddly, the exact eigenfunction from which their rules were obtained
received hardly any attention. Using three fundamental symmetries, we give a
derivation of the Wigner-Witmer diatomic eigenfunction. Applications of our
derivations are fundamental to predicting accurate diatomic molecular spectra
that we compare with recorded spectra for diagnostic purposes, such as
measurements of molecular spectra following generation of laser-induced plasma.

  Site Burial Depth in Proteins: The ""Cutting Plane"" and ""Tangent Sphere""
  Methods","11 pages text; 7 figures (all multi-panel); 3 tables; 34 total pages
  (incl. figures & tables)",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe two complementary methods to quantify the degree of burial of
ligand and/or ligand binding site (LBS) in a protein-ligand complex, namely,
the ""cutting plane"" (CP) and the ""tangent sphere"" (TS) methods. To construct
the CP and TS, two centroids are required: the protein molecular centroid
(global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid, LC). The CP is
defined as the plane passing through the LBS centroid (LC) and normal to the
line passing through the LC and the protein molecular centroid (GC). The
""anterior side"" of the CP is the side not containing the GC (which the
""posterior"" side does). The TS is defined as the sphere with center at GC and
tangent to the CP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms (a.) inside the TS,
and (b.) on the anterior side of the CP, are two complementary measures of
ligand or LBS burial depth since the latter is directly proportional to (b.)
and inversely proportional to (a.). We tested the CP and TS methods using a
test set of 67 well characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski et al.,
1996), as well as the theoretical case of an artificial protein in the form of
a cubic lattice grid of points in the overall shape of a sphere and in which
LBS of any depth can be specified. Results from both the CP and TS methods
agree very well with data reported by Laskowski et al., and results from the
theoretical case further confirm that that both methods are suitable measures
of ligand or LBS burial. Prior to this study, there were no such numerical
measures of LBS burial available, and hence no way to directly and objectively
compare LBS depths in different proteins. LBS burial depth is an important
parameter as it is usually directly related to the amount of conformational
change a protein undergoes upon ligand binding, and ability to quantify it
could allow meaningful comparison of protein dynamics and flexibility.
