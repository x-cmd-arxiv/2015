becomes alternative method for increasing orbital debris detection and
surveillance. This observational mode is expected to eye medium-sized objects
in higher orbits (e.g. MEO, GTO, GSO \& GEO), beyond the reach of usual radar
system. However, such observation of fast-moving objects demands special
treatment and analysis technique. In this study, we performed photometric
analysis of the satellite track images photographed using rehabilitated Schmidt
Bima Sakti telescope in Bosscha Observatory. The Hough transformation was
implemented to automatically detect linear streak from the images. From this
analysis and comparison to USSPACECOM catalog, two satellites were identified
and associated with inactive Thuraya-3 satellite and Satcom-3 debris which are
located at geostationary orbit. Further aperture photometry analysis revealed
the periodicity of tumbling Satcom-3 debris. In the near future, it is not
impossible to apply similar scheme to establish an analysis pipeline for
optical space surveillance system hosted in Indonesia.

the LTE cognitive femto-cells, with an objective of maximizing the femto-cells
downlink throughput. Cognitive femto-cells opportunistically transmit on the
macro-cell channels when they are free of use. Those free channels are located
by means of spectrum sensing using energy detection. Moreover, periodic sensing
is adopted to detect any changes of the sensing outcomes. The maximum
attainable femto-cell downlink throughput varies with the macro-cell channel
occupancy statistics. Therefore, the LTE macro-cell occupancy is empirically
modeled using exponential distributions mixture. The LTE cognitive femto-cell
downlink throughput is maximized by compromising the transmission efficiency,
the explored spectrum opportunities and the interference from the macro-cell.
An analytical solution for the optimal periodic sensing interval that maximizes
the throughput is found and verified by simulations. The obtained results show
that there is indeed a single periodic sensing interval value that maximizes
the LTE cognitive femto-cell downlink throughput. At the peak of the macro-cell
traffic, our framework increases the femto-cell throughput by around 15%
compared to the senseless case. The impact of the available number of channels
for opportunistic access is studied and no significant impact is found for more
than three channels.

assessment of the theoretical predictions on the structure of the Hessian. The
experimental results are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions. The
procedures employed in this study provide the basis for future multispin

strategy incentive compatibility and Bayesian incentive compatibility. These
solution concepts relieve the (possibly unsophisticated) bidders from the need
to engage in complicated strategizing. While incentive properties are simple to
state, their proofs are specific to the mechanism and can be quite complex.
This raises two concerns. From a practical perspective, checking a complex
proof can be a tedious process, often requiring experts knowledgeable in
mechanism design. Furthermore, from a modeling perspective, if unsophisticated
agents are unconvinced of incentive properties, they may strategize in
unpredictable ways.
  To address both concerns, we explore techniques from computer-aided
verification to construct formal proofs of incentive properties. Because formal
proofs can be automatically checked, agents do not need to manually check the
properties, or even understand the proof. To demonstrate, we present the
verification of a sophisticated mechanism: the generic reduction from Bayesian
incentive compatible mechanism design to algorithm design given by Hartline,
Kleinberg, and Malekian. This mechanism presents new challenges for formal
verification, including essential use of randomness from both the execution of
the mechanism and from the prior type distributions. As an immediate
consequence, our work also formalizes Bayesian incentive compatibility for the
entire family of mechanisms derived via this reduction. Finally, as an
intermediate step in our formalization, we provide the first formal
verification of incentive compatibility for the celebrated
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.

links are sensitive to misalignment in antenna directionality because of
movement of devices. To identify and circumvent the misalignments, we propose
to use the motion sensors (i.e., accelerometer and gyroscope) which are already
present in most of the modern mobile devices. By finding the extent of
misaligned beams, corrective actions are carried out to reconfigure the
antennas. Motion sensors on mobile devices provide means to estimate the extent
of misalignments. We collected real data from motion sensors and steer the
beams appropriately. The results from our study show that the sensors are
capable of detecting the cause of errors as translational or rotational
movements. Furthermore it is also shown that the sensor data can be used to
predict the next location of the user. This can be used to reconfigure the
directional antenna to switch the antenna beam directions and hence avoid
frequent link disruptions. This decreases the number of beam searches thus
lowering the MAC overhead.

created in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision. It provides a good
description of transverse momentum spectra and anisotropic flow. These
observables, however, cannot be consistently derived using viscous
hydrodynamics alone, because they depend on the microscopic interactions at
freeze-out. We derive the ideal hydrodynamic limit and the first-order viscous
correction to anisotropic flow ($v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$) and momentum spectrum
using a transport calculation. The linear response coefficient to the initial
anisotropy, $v_n(p_T)/\varepsilon_n$, depends little on $n$ in the ideal
hydrodynamic limit. The viscous correction to the spectrum depends not only on
the differential cross section, but also on the initial momentum distribution.
This dependence is not captured by standard second-order viscous hydrodynamics.
The viscous correction to anisotropic flow increases with $p_T$, but this
increase is slower than usually assumed in viscous hydrodynamic calculations.
In particular, it is too slow to explain the observed maximum of $v_n$ at
$p_T\sim 3$ GeV/c.

the signal belongs to a low-dimensional set buried in a high-dimensional space.
A rough heuristic often used in practice postulates that non-linear

may be estimated using the generalized Lasso. This is appealing because of the
abundance of efficient, specialized solvers for this program. Just as noise may
be diminished by projecting onto the lower dimensional space, the error from
modeling non-linear observations with linear observations will be greatly
reduced when using the signal structure in the reconstruction. We allow general
signal structure, only assuming that the signal belongs to some set K in R^n.
We consider the single-index model of non-linearity. Our theory allows the
non-linearity to be discontinuous, not one-to-one and even unknown. We assume a
random Gaussian model for the measurement matrix, but allow the rows to have an
unknown covariance matrix. As special cases of our results, we recover
near-optimal theory for noisy linear observations, and also give the first
theoretical accuracy guarantee for 1-bit compressed sensing with unknown

extension of a previous work, in which we studied a spin-boson system, to a
Brownian system. It is shown that the QHFP in real time obtained from a
correlated thermal equilibrium state of the total system possess the same form
as those obtained from a factorized initial state. A modified terminator for
the hierarchal equations of motion is introduced to treat the non-Markovian
case more efficiently. Using the imaginary-time QHFP, numerous thermodynamic
quantities, including the free energy, entropy, internal energy, heat capacity,
and susceptibility can be evaluated for any potential. These equations allow us
to treat non-Markovian, non-perturbative system-bath interactions at finite
temperature. Through numerical integration of the real-time QHFP for a harmonic
system, we obtain the equilibrium distributions, the auto-correlation function,
and the first- and second-order response functions. These results are compared
with analytically exact results for the same quantities. This provides a
critical test of the formalism for a non-factorized thermal state, and
elucidates the roles of fluctuation, dissipation, non-Markovian effects, and
system-bath coherence. Employing numerical solutions of the imaginary-time

perform inference in a probabilistic latent-variable sequence model. Given the
recent success of continuous vector space word representations, we provide such
an inference procedure for continuous states, where words' representations are
given by the posterior mean of a linear dynamical system. Here, efficient
inference can be performed using Kalman filtering. Our learning algorithm is
extremely scalable, operating on simple cooccurrence counts for both parameter
initialization using the method of moments and subsequent iterations of EM. In
our experiments, we employ our inferred word embeddings as features in standard
tagging tasks, obtaining significant accuracy improvements. Finally, the Kalman
filter updates can be seen as a linear recurrent neural network. We demonstrate
that using the parameters of our model to initialize a non-linear recurrent
neural network language model reduces its training time by a day and yields
lower perplexity.

our attempts to better harness the internal decision making process of cellular

arises naturally from the CA requirement that a cell receives the state of each
neighbour before updating. The significant result is the existence of a
bijective mapping between the asynchronous system and the synchronous system
classically used to update cellular automata. Consequently, although the CA
outputs look qualitatively different, when surveyed on ""contours"" of real time,
the asynchronous CA replicates the synchronous CA. Moreover, this type of
asynchrony is simple - it is characterised by the underlying network structure
of the cells, and long-term behaviour is deterministic and periodic due to the
linearity of max-plus algebra. The findings lead us to proffer max-plus algebra
as: (i) a more accurate and efficient underlying timing mechanism for models of

The real part of dielectric constant,$\epsilon_{re}$, is essentially constant

explore the physical mechanisms underlying the nonlinear transfer of energy,
the damping of the turbulent fluctuations, and the development of coherent
structures in kinetic plasma turbulence. It is argued that the linear and
nonlinear dynamics of Alfven waves are responsible, at a very fundamental
level, for some of the key qualitative features of plasma turbulence that
distinguish it from hydrodynamic turbulence, including the anisotropic cascade
of energy and the development of current sheets at small scales. The first
dynamical model of kinetic turbulence in the weakly collisional solar wind
plasma that combines self-consistently the physics of Alfven waves with the
development of small-scale current sheets is presented and its physical
implications are discussed. This model leads to a simplified perspective on the
nature of turbulence in a weakly collisional plasma: the nonlinear interactions
responsible for the turbulent cascade of energy and the formation of current
sheets are essentially fluid in nature, while the collisionless damping of the
turbulent fluctuations and the energy injection by kinetic instabilities are
essentially kinetic in nature.

a number of subarrays that are allowed to overlap. Each of the antenna elements
in these subarrays have signals orthogonal to each other and to the elements of
the other subarrays. The proposed architecture not only improves sidelobe
suppression to reduce interference to communications system, but also enjoys
the advantages of MIMO radar without sacrificing the main desirable

radar signal onto the null space of the communications system's interference
channel, which helps to avoid interference from the radar. Numerical results

statistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected on
the plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of Galactic dust
observed by Planck at 353 GHz, and the gas column density structures,
quantified by the gradient of the column density, $N_H$. The selected regions,
covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angular
resolution of 10' FWHM, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in the
nearest cloud. The column densities in the selected regions range from $N_H
\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulk
of the molecular clouds. The relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixel
and analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called
""Histogram of Relative Orientations"". Throughout this study, we assume that the
polarized emission observed by Planck at 353 GHz is representative of the
projected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume a
constant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.
Within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressively
with increasing $N_H$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferred
orientation to preferentially perpendicular. In simulations of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relative
orientation is a signature of Alfv\'enic or sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence, implying
that the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scales
probed by Planck. We compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimates
we obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the Planck
observations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation and
evolution.

metal-free atomic cooling halos at high redshifts ($z > 10$) is nowadays object
of intense study and several methods to prove their existence are currently
under development. The abrupt collapse of a massive ($\sim 10^4 - 10^5 \,
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) and rotating object is a powerful source of gravitational
waves emission. In this work, we employ modern waveforms and the improved
knowledge on the DCBHs formation rate to estimate the gravitational signal
emitted by these sources at cosmological distances. Their formation rate is
very high ($\sim 10^4 \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ up to $z\sim20$), but due to a short
duration of the collapse event ($\sim 2-30\, \mathrm{s}$, depending on the DCBH
mass) the integrated signal from these sources is characterized by a very low
duty-cycle (${\cal D}\sim 10^{-3}$), i.e. a shot-noise signal. Our results show
that the estimated signal lies above the foreseen sensitivity of the
Ultimate-DECIGO observatory in the frequency range $(0.8-300) \, \mathrm{mHz}$,
with a peak amplitude $\Omega_{gw} = 1.1 \times 10^{-54}$ at $\nu_{max} = 0.9
\, \mathrm{mHz}$ and a peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio $\mathrm{SNR}\sim 22$ at $\nu
= 20 \, \mathrm{mHz}$. This amplitude is lower than the Galactic confusion
noise, generated by binary systems of compact objects in the same frequency
band. For this reason, advanced techniques will be required to separate this
signal from background and foreground noise components. As a proof-of-concept,
we conclude by proposing a simple method, based on the auto-correlation
function, to recognize the presence of a ${\cal D} \ll 1$ signal buried into
the continuous noise. The aim of this work is to test the existence of a large
population of high-z DCBHs, by observing the gravitational waves emitted during
their infancy.

these possess event horizons inside which information that led to their

enhancement of the ratio of first to second peak neutron capture elements

problems, such as the Haldane conjecture, existence of gapped topological spin
liquid phases, or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These
and other problems are particular cases of the general spectral gap problem:
given a quantum many-body Hamiltonian, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove
that this is an undecidable problem. We construct families of quantum spin
systems on a 2D lattice with translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour
interactions for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable. This result
extends to undecidability of other low energy properties, such as existence of
algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines
Hamiltonian complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a
Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the evolution of a quantum
phase-estimation algorithm followed by a universal Turing Machine. The spectral
gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding Halting Problem. Our result
implies that there exists no algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary model

Flavorspin, under which quarks transform as triplets. The fundamental Yukawa

the flavor symmetry. A CP-conserving scenario is naturally defined with the
feature that the Yukawa spurions are completely determined in terms of the

enlarge the sampling with the same or larger errors; b) almost all dynamical

stronger than 0.5; c) the correlation strength between (V-R) vs. (R-I) is
systematically lower than the one between (B-V) vs. (V-R) and is not related

describe our implementation of the moment formalism and important tests of our

star merger. We use as initial data an existing general relativistic simulation
of the merger of a neutron star of 1.4 solar mass with a black hole of 7 solar
mass and dimensionless spin a/M=0.8. Comparing with a simpler leakage scheme
for the treatment of the neutrinos, we find noticeable differences in the
neutron to proton ratio in and around the disk, and in the neutrino luminosity.
We find that the electron neutrino luminosity is much lower in the transport
simulations, and that the remnant is less neutron-rich. The spatial
distribution of the neutrinos is significantly affected by relativistic
effects. Over the short timescale evolved, we do not observe purely
neutrino-driven outflows. However, a small amount of material (3e-4Msun) is
ejected in the polar region during the circularization of the disk. Most of
that material is ejected early in the formation of the disk, and is fairly
neutron rich. Through r-process nucleosynthesis, that material should produce
high-opacity lanthanides in the polar region, and could thus affect the
lightcurve of radioactively powered electromagnetic transients. We also show
that by the end of the simulation, while the bulk of the disk is neutron-rich,
its outer layers have a higher electron fraction. As that material would be the
first to be unbound by disk outflows on longer timescales, the changes in Ye
experienced during the formation of the disk could have an impact on the
nucleosynthesis outputs from neutrino-driven and viscously-driven outflows.

decision makers, and produce information that may help in future decisions.
This phenomenon is common in a wide range of scenarios in the Internet economy,
as well as in other domains such as medical decisions. Each decision-maker
would individually prefer to ""exploit"": select an action with the highest
expected reward given her current information. At the same time, each
decision-maker would prefer previous decision-makers to ""explore"", producing
information about the rewards of various actions. A social planner, by means of
carefully designed information disclosure, can incentivize the agents to
balance the exploration and exploitation so as to maximize social welfare.
  We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem (and various
generalizations thereof) under incentive-compatibility constraints induced by
the agents' Bayesian priors. We design an incentive-compatible bandit algorithm
for the social planner whose regret is asymptotically optimal among all bandit
algorithms (incentive-compatible or not). Further, we provide a black-box
reduction from an arbitrary multi-arm bandit algorithm to an
incentive-compatible one, with only a constant multiplicative increase in
regret. This reduction works for very general bandit setting that incorporate
contexts and arbitrary auxiliary feedback.

separation. The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals
are linearly mixed to form the observed signals. We propose a new algorithm,
PEGI (for pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery for
ICA with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to
use a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite ""inner product"")
space. The use of this indefinite ""inner product"" resolves technical issues
common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. This leads to an algorithm
which is conceptually simple, efficient and accurate in testing.
  Our second contribution is combining PEGI with the analysis of objectives for
optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model. It has been observed that the direct
approach of demixing with the inverse of the mixing matrix is suboptimal for
signal recovery in terms of the natural Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) criterion. There have been several partial solutions proposed in the ICA
literature. It turns out that any solution to the mixing matrix reconstruction
problem can be used to construct an SINR-optimal ICA demixing, despite the fact
that SINR itself cannot be computed from data. That allows us to obtain a
practical and provably SINR-optimal recovery method for ICA with arbitrary
Gaussian noise.

resonances permeate the spectrum at wavenumber intervals of $0.074
~\textrm{cm}^{-1}$, and are highly stable under changes in the machine setup
(energy, bucket filling pattern, CSR in bursting or continuous mode). Analogous
resonances were predicted long ago in an idealized theory as eigenmodes of a
smooth toroidal vacuum chamber driven by a bunched beam moving on a circular
orbit. A corollary of peaks in the spectrum is the presence of pulses in the
wakefield of the bunch at well defined spatial intervals. Through experiments
and further calculations we elucidate the resonance and wakefield mechanisms in
the CLS vacuum chamber, which has a fluted form much different from a smooth
torus. The wakefield is observed directly in the 30-110 GHz range by RF diodes,
and indirectly by an interferometer in the THz range. The wake pulse sequence
found by diodes is less regular than in the toroidal model, and depends on the
point of observation, but is accounted for in a simulation of fields in the
fluted chamber. Attention is paid to polarization of the observed fields, and
possible coherence of fields produced in adjacent bending magnets. Low
frequency wakefield production appears to be mainly local in a single bend, but
multi-bend effects cannot be excluded entirely, and could play a role in high
frequency resonances. New simulation techniques have been developed, which
should be invaluable in further work.

levels and field polarizations where the guided probe field is quasilinearly
polarized along the major or minor principal axis, which is parallel or
perpendicular, respectively, to the radial direction of the atomic position.
Our numerical calculations indicate that 200 cesium atoms in a linear array
with a length of 100 $\mu$m at a distance of 200 nm from the surface of a
nanofiber with a radius of 250 nm can slow down the speed of guided probe light
by a factor of about $3.5\times 10^6$ (the corresponding group delay is about
1.17 $\mu$s). In the neighborhood of the Bragg resonance, a significant
fraction of the guided probe light can be reflected back with a negative group
delay. The reflectivity and the group delay of the reflected field do not
depend on the propagation direction of the probe field. However, when the input
guided light is quasilinearly polarized along the major principal axis, the
transmittivity and the group delay of the transmitted field substantially
depend on the propagation direction of the probe field. Under the Bragg
resonance condition, an array of atoms prepared in an appropriate internal
state can transmit guided light polarized along the major principal in one
specific direction even in the limit of infinitely large atom numbers. The
directionality of transmission of guided light through the array of atoms is a
consequence of the existence of a longitudinal component of the guided light
field as well as the ellipticity of both the field polarization and the atomic
dipole vector.

dispersive suppression of intensity cutting across the valence band, which,
when compared with relativistic one-step calculations, can be traced to two
final-state gaps in the bands 6 eV above the Fermi level. This finding opens up

with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible
versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised
learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised,
unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic
learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates
(Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that
makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be
interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the
neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective
function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main
idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e.,
with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics.
Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating
the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated
using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and
backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder.
Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of
auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative
interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on
generative learning tasks.

architecture, wherein small cells are expected to provide very high capacity.
However, due to the limited licensed spectrum for cellular networks, any effort
to achieve capacity growth through network densification will face the
challenge of severe inter-cell interference. In view of this, recent
standardization developments have started to consider the opportunities for
cellular networks to use the unlicensed spectrum bands, including the 2.4 GHz

network architecture where small cells use the same unlicensed spectrum that
Wi-Fi systems operate in without affecting the performance of Wi-Fi systems. We
present an almost blank subframe (ABS) scheme without priority to mitigate the
co-channel interference from small cells to Wi-Fi systems, and propose an
interference avoidance scheme based on small cells estimating the density of
nearby Wi-Fi access points to facilitate their coexistence while sharing the
same unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed network
architecture and interference avoidance schemes can significantly increase the
capacity of 4G heterogeneous cellular networks while maintaining the service
quality of Wi-Fi systems.

along the line of sight due to interactions with the extragalactic background
light (EBL). In this paper, we show that the gamma-ray optical depth can be
reduced to the convolution product of an EBL kernel with the EBL intensity,
assuming a particular form for the EBL evolution. We extract the absorption
signal from the most extensive set of TeV spectra from blazars collected so far

spectrum is in good agreement with the accumulated emission of galaxies,
constraining unresolved populations of sources. We propose a data-driven
estimate of the Hubble constant based on the comparison of local and gamma-ray

of four TeV blazars, we investigate the 106 gamma-ray spectra in our sample and

harder than their GeV counterpart, and no spectral upturn is visible at the

  This paper considers developing kernel methods associated with the needlet
kernel for nonparametric regression problems whose predictor variables are
defined on a sphere. Due to the localization property in the frequency domain,
we prove that the regularization parameter of the kernel ridge regression
associated with the needlet kernel can decrease arbitrarily fast. A natural
consequence is that the regularization term for the kernel ridge regression is
not necessary in the sense of rate optimality. Based on the excellent
localization property in the spacial domain further, we also prove that all the
$l^{q}$ $(01\leq q < \infty)$ kernel regularization estimates associated with
the needlet kernel, including the kernel lasso estimate and the kernel bridge
estimate, possess almost the same generalization capability for a large range
of regularization parameters in the sense of rate optimality.
  This finding tentatively reveals that, if the needlet kernel is utilized,
then the choice of $q$ might not have a strong impact in terms of the
generalization capability in some modeling contexts. From this perspective, $q$
can be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by other no generalization
criteria like smoothness, computational complexity, sparsity, etc..

communication, direct communication between devices subscribed to different
mobile operators should be supported. This would also support meeting
requirements resulting from D2D relevant scenarios, like vehicle-to-vehicle
communication. In this paper, we propose to allocate the multi-operator D2D
communication over dedicated cellular spectral resources contributed from both
operators. Ideally, the operators should negotiate about the amount of spectrum
to contribute, without revealing proprietary information to each other and/or
to other parties. One possible way to do that is to use the sequence of
operators' best responses, i.e., the operators make offers about the amount of
spectrum to contribute using a sequential updating procedure until reaching
consensus. Besides spectrum allocation, we need a mode selection scheme for the
multi-operator D2D users. We use a stochastic geometry framework to capture the
impact of mode selection on the distribution of D2D users and assess the
performance of the best response iteration algorithm. With the performance
metrics considered in the paper, we show that the best response iteration has a
unique Nash equilibrium that can be reached from any initial strategy. In
general, asymmetric operators would contribute unequal amounts of spectrum for
multi-operator D2D communication. Provided that the multi-operator D2D density
is not negligible, we show that both operators may experience significant
performance gains as compared to the scheme without spectrum sharing.

Indeed, we find that the solutions of $R^2$ gravity are in one-to-one

$R^2$ gravity has a rich structure of vacuum static spherically symmetric

ultimately apply it to a set of observed maps. We develop the wavelet-based
weighted cross-correlation (WWCC) method to study the relative contribution of
structures of different sizes and their degree of correlation in two maps as a
function of spatial scale, and the mutual displacement of structures in the
molecular cloud maps. We test the WWCC for circular structures having a single
prominent scale and fractal structures showing a self-similar behavior without
prominent scales. Observational noise and a finite map size limit the scales
where the cross-correlation coefficients and displacement vectors can be
reliably measured. For fractal maps containing many structures on all scales,
the limitation from the observational noise is negligible for signal-to-noise
ratios >5. (abbrev). Application of the WWCC to the observed line maps of the
giant molecular cloud G333 allows to add specific scale information to the
results obtained earlier using the principle component analysis. It confirms
the chemical and excitation similarity of $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O on all
scales, but shows a deviation of HCN at scales of up to 7' (~7 pc). This can be
interpreted as a chemical transition scale. The largest structures also show a
systematic offset along the filament, probably due to a large-scale density
gradient. The WWCC can compare correlated structures in different maps of

H_2$ clouds under conditions typical for star-forming galaxies in the Universe.
We discover that this most important molecule for tracing H$_2$ gas is very
effectively destroyed in ISM environments with CR energy densities $\rm
U_{CR}\sim(50-10^{3})\times U_{CR,Gal}$, a range expected in numerous
star-forming systems throughout the Universe. This density-dependent effect
operates volumetrically rather than only on molecular cloud surfaces (i.e.
unlike FUV radiation that also destroys CO), and is facilitated by: a) the
direct destruction of CO by CRs, and b) a reaction channel activated by
CR-produced He$^{+}$. The effect we uncover is strong enough to render
Milky-Way type Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) very CO-poor (and thus
CO-untraceable), even in ISM environments with rather modestly enhanced average
CR energy densities of $\rm U_{CR}\sim(10-50)\times\rm U_{CR,Gal}$. We conclude
that the CR-induced destruction of CO in molecular clouds, unhindered by dust
absorption, is perhaps the single most important factor controlling the
CO-visibility of molecular gas in vigorously star-forming galaxies. We
anticipate that a second order effect of this CO destruction mechanism will be
to make the H$_2$ distribution in the gas-rich disks of such galaxies appear
much clumpier in CO $J$=1--0, 2--1 line emission than it actually is. Finally
we give an analytical approximation of the CO/H$_2$ abundance ratio as a
function of gas density and CR energy density for use in galaxy-size or
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and propose some key observational
tests.

interconnected systems with undirected topology and linear dynamic coupling.
Interactions between the systems are treated as linear dynamic uncertainty and
are described in terms of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A
consensus-type tracking control protocol is proposed for each system based on
its state relative its neighbors. In addition a selected set of subsystems uses
for control their relative states with respect to the leader. Two methods are
proposed for the design of this control protocol. One method uses a coordinate
transformation to recast the protocol design problem as a decentralized robust
control problem for an auxiliary interconnected large scale system. Another
method is direct, it does not employ coordinate transformation; it also allows
for more general linear uncertain interactions. Using these methods, sufficient
conditions are obtained which guarantee that the system tracks the leader.
These conditions guarantee a suboptimal bound on the system consensus and
tracking performance. The proposed methods are compared using a simulation
example, and their effectiveness is discussed. Also, algorithms are proposed
for computing suboptimal controllers.

the segmental keystone transform (SKT) is used to correct the range walk of
targets simultaneously, and a new transform, namely, Doppler Lv's transform
(LVT) is applied on the azimuth signal to estimate the parameters. Theoretical
analysis confirms that no interpolation is needed for the proposed method and
the targets can be well focused within limited searching range of the ambiguity
number. The proposed method is capable of obtaining the accurate parameter
estimates efficiently in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario with low

(additive, central maps) on Leavitt path algebras, the algebraic counterparts
of graph $C^*$-algebras. In particular, we consider traces which vanish on
nonzero graded components of a Leavitt path algebra and refer to them as {\em
canonical} since they are uniquely determined by their values on the vertices.
  A desirable property of a $\mathbb{C}$-valued trace on a $C^*$-algebra is
that the trace of an element of the positive cone is nonnegative. We adapt this
property to traces on a Leavitt path algebra $L_K(E)$ with values in any
involutive ring. We refer to traces with this property as positive. If a
positive trace is injective on positive elements, we say that it is faithful.
We characterize when a canonical, $K$-linear trace is positive and when it is
faithful in terms of its values on the vertices. As a consequence, we obtain a
bijective correspondence between the set of faithful, gauge invariant,
$\mathbb{C}$-valued (algebra) traces on $L_{\mathbb{C}}(E)$ of a countable
graph $E$ and the set of faithful, semifinite, lower semicontinuous, gauge
invariant (operator theory) traces on the corresponding graph $C^*$-algebra
$C^*(E)$.
  With the direct finite condition (i.e $xy=1$ implies $yx=1$) for unital rings
adapted to rings with local units, we characterize directly finite Leavitt path
algebras as exactly those having the underlying graphs in which no cycle has an
exit. Our proof involves consideration of ""local"" Cohn-Leavitt subalgebras of
finite subgraphs. Lastly, we show that, while related, the class of locally

absence of without ant centralized coordination system. Due to that the
attackers or malicious nodes are easily affected that kind of network and
responsible for the routing misbehavior. The routing is network is mandatory to
deliver data in between source and destination. In this research we work on
security field in MANET and proposed a novel security scheme against routing
misbehavior through Black hole attack. The Ad hoc On demand Multipath Routing
(AOMDV) protocol is consider for routing and also to improves the routing
quality as compare to single path routing protocol. The attacker is affected
all the possible paths that is selected by sender for sending data in network.
The malicious nodes are forward optimistic reply at the time of routing by that
their identification is also a complex procedure. The proposed Intrusion
Detection System (IDS) scheme is identified the attacker information through
hop count mechanism. The routing information of actual data is reached to which
intermediate node and the next hop information is exist at that node is confirm
by IDS scheme. The black hole attacker node Identification (ID) is forward in
network by that in future attacker is not participating in routing procedure.
The proposed security scheme detects and provides the deterrence against
routing misbehavior through malicious attack. Here we compare the routing
performance of AOMDV, Attack and IDS scheme. The performance of normal
multipath routing and proposed IDS scheme is almost equal. The attacker has
degrades the whole routing performance but observed that in presence of
attacker, routing misbehavior is completely block by the proposed IDS scheme
and recovers 95 % of data as compare to normal routing. Keywords- -AOMDV,
MANET, IDS, Black hole attack, Routing misbehavior.

radio interferometer, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA, located at
the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia, consists
of 128 dual-polarized aperture-array elements (tiles) operating between 80 and
300\,MHz, with a total processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz for each polarization.
Radio-frequency signals from the tiles are amplified and band limited using
analog signal conditioning units; sampled and channelized by digital-receivers.
The signals from eight tiles are processed by a single digital-receiver, thus
requiring 16 digital-receivers for the MWA. The main function of the
digital-receivers is to digitize the broad-band signals from each tile,
channelize them to form the sky-band, and transport it through optical fibers
to a centrally located correlator for further processing. The digital-receiver
firmware also implements functions to measure the signal power, perform power
equalization across the band, detect interference-like events, and invoke
diagnostic modes. The digital-receiver is controlled by high-level programs
running on a single-board-computer. This paper presents the digital-receiver
design, implementation, current status, and plans for future enhancements.

can be also obtained from Pyramidal QDs of different designs from the one
already reported in Juska et al. (Nat. Phot. 7, 527, 2013). Moreover, some of
the limitations for a higher density of entangled photon emitters are
addressed. Among these issues are (1) a remaining small fine-structure
splitting and (2) an effective QD charging under non-resonant excitation
conditions, which strongly reduce the number of useful biexciton-exciton
recombination events. A possible solution of the charging problem is
investigated exploiting a dual-wavelength excitation technique, which allows a
gradual QD charge tuning from strongly negative to positive and, eventually,
efficient detection of entangled photons from QDs, which would be otherwise
ineffective under a single-wavelength (non-resonant) excitation.

manipulators and controls making it easy to animate by the animators. These
controls consist of simple joints, handles, or even separate character
selection windows.This research paper present an automated rigging system for
quadruped characters with custom controls and manipulators for animation.The
full character rigging mechanism is procedurally driven based on various
principles and requirements used by the riggers and animators. The automation
is achieved initially by creating widgets according to the character type.
These widgets then can be customized by the rigger according to the character
shape, height and proportion. Then joint locations for each body parts are
calculated and widgets are replaced programmatically.Finally a complete and
fully operational procedurally generated character control rig is created and
attached with the underlying skeletal joints. The functionality and feasibility
of the rig was analyzed from various source of actual character motion and a
requirements criterion was met. The final rigged character provides an
efficient and easy to manipulate control rig with no lagging and at high frame
rate.

technologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of
study, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a
consensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research
designs that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper
aims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and
linking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the
operationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by
combining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of
'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional
issues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five
attributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)
radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent
impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising
emerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed
attributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly
in, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and
study of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,
citation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)
and elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different
attributes of emergence.
