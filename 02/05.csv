language processing applications. More specifically, complex networks concepts
and methods from dynamical systems theory have been successfully applied to
recognize stylistic patterns in written texts. Despite the large amount of
studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a few studies
have assessed the relevance of attributes derived from the analysis of
stylistic fluctuations. Because fluctuations represent a pivotal factor for
characterizing a myriad of real systems, this study focused on the analysis of
the properties of stylistic fluctuations in texts via topological analysis of
complex networks and intermittency measurements. The results showed that
different authors display distinct fluctuation patterns. In particular, it was
found that it is possible to identify the authorship of books using the
intermittency of specific words. Taken together, the results described here
suggest that the patterns found in stylistic fluctuations could be used to
analyze other related complex systems. Furthermore, the discovery of novel
patterns related to textual stylistic fluctuations indicates that these
patterns could be useful to improve the state of the art of many
stylistic-based natural language processing tasks.

creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and
planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce measurable orbital changes
over decades and substantial orbital effects over millions to billions of

observable proxy of halo assembly time, in that galaxy groups with higher $f_c$
assembled their masses earlier. Using SDSS groups of Yang et al., we study how
$f_c$ correlates with galaxy properties such as color, star formation rate,
metallicity, bulge to disk ratio, and size. Central galaxies of a given stellar
mass in groups with $f_c>0.02$ tend to be redder in color, more quenched in
star formation, smaller in size, and more bulge dominated, as $f_c$ increases.
The trends in color and star formation appear to reverse at $f_c<0.02$,
reflecting a down-sizing effect that galaxies in massive halos formed their
stars earlier although the host halos themselves assembled later (lower $f_c$).
No such reversal is seen in the size of elliptical galaxies, suggesting that
their assembly follows halo growth more closely than their star formation.
Satellite galaxies of a given stellar mass in groups of a given halo mass tend
to be redder in color, more quenched in star formation and smaller in size as
$f_c$ increases. For a given stellar mass, satellites also tend to be smaller
than centrals. The trends are stronger for lower mass groups. For groups more
massive than $\sim 10^{13}{\rm M}_\odot$, a weak reversed trend is seen in

qualitatively reproduced by an empirical model based on halo age abundance
matching, but not by a semi-analytical model tested here.

induces estimation errors that are propagated into the unmixing procedure. To
address this issue, endmember variability estimation consists of estimating the

derived as well as their variability with respect to these references. This
paper introduces a new linear mixing model that explicitly accounts for spatial

state vector of a linear system to a final one, in finite time, using minimum
energy control. In the case where the dynamics correspond to an integrator
($\dot x(t) = u(t)$) this amounts to a Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport
(OMT) problem. In general, we show that the problem can again be reduced to
solving an OMT problem and that it has a unique solution. In parallel, we study
the optimal steering of the state-density of a linear stochastic system with
white noise disturbance; this is known to correspond to a Schr\""odinger bridge.
As the white noise intensity tends to zero, the flow of densities converges to
that of the deterministic dynamics and can serve as a way to compute the
solution of its deterministic counterpart. The solution can be expressed in
closed-form for Gaussian initial and final state densities in both cases.

  We find that the distribution of P/sini for our dM3 stars is different from
the distribution of P/sini among our samples of dM2 and dM4 stars. The mean
rotation rate for the dM3 stars (excluding dM3e and sdM3 stars) is
significantly slower (25.8 days) than for dM2 (14.4 days) and dM4 stars (11.4
days). Analogous behavior also emerges among the faster rotators (dMe stars):
we find that a longer rotation period also occurs at spectral sub-type dM3e.
Our data suggest that, as regards the rotational properties of lower main
sequence stars, spectral sub-type dM3 stands out as exhibiting unusual slow
rotation compared to that of adjoining sub-types. Our data lead us to suggest
that the unusual rotational properties of M3 dwarfs may represent a signature
of the transition to complete convection (TTCC).

  Falsification is an alternative approach that uncovers definite errors in

decompose the rotation curves in terms of the dynamical contributions by
baryons and dark matter halos, and compare the latter with those of dwarf
galaxies from THINGS as well as Lambda CDM SPH simulations in which the effect
of baryonic feedback processes is included. Being generally consistent with
THINGS and simulated dwarf galaxies, most of the LITTLE THINGS sample galaxies
show a linear increase of the rotation curve in their inner regions, which
gives shallower logarithmic inner slopes alpha of their dark matter density
profiles. The mean value of the slopes of the 26 LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies
is alpha =-0.32 +/- 0.24 which is in accordance with the previous results found

consistent with a previously observed weak dependence on observing frequency,
which may be indicative of a deviation from a Kolmogorov spectrum of electron
density irregularities along the line of sight. The rate and strength of these
giant pulses is less than has been observed at $\sim$100 MHz. Additionally, the
mean (normal) pulse flux density we observed is less than at $\sim$100 MHz.

Biot's model of wave propagation in porous materials should be used. However,
the application of Biot's model is complicated by the large property space of
the underlying porous material. Here the properties of ice and air as well as
empirical relationships are used to define the properties of snow as a function
of porosity. Based on these relations, phase velocities and plane wave
attenuation of shear- and compressional-waves as functions of porosity or
density are predicted. For light snow the peculiarity was found that the
velocity of the first compressional wave is lower than the second compressional
wave that is commonly referred to as the ""slow"" wave. The reversal of the
velocities comes with an increase of attenuation for the first compressional

reasoning rules, these techniques can be used to prove important safety
properties about the architecture prior to system construction. For these
proofs to be meaningful, each leaf-level component contract must be realizable;
i.e., it is possible to construct a component such that for any input allowed
by the contract assumptions, there is some output value that the component can
produce that satisfies the contract guarantees. We have recently proposed (in
[1]) a contract-based realizability checking algorithm for assume/guarantee
contracts over infinite theories supported by SMT solvers such as linear
integer/real arithmetic and uninterpreted functions. In that work, we used an
SMT solver and an algorithm similar to k-induction to establish the
realizability of a contract, and justified our approach via a hand proof. Given
the central importance of realizability to our virtual integration approach, we
wanted additional confidence that our approach was sound. This paper describes
a complete formalization of the approach in the Coq proof and specification

assumptions in our reasoning. Although these did not compromise the correctness
of the algorithm used in the checking tools, they point to the value of
machine-checked formalization. In addition, we believe this is the first
machine-checked formalization for a realizability algorithm.

together. This is commonly believed to be the result of the two component
chondrules having collided shortly after forming, while still molten. This
allows high velocity impacts to result in sticking. However, at T ~ 1100K, the
temperature below which chondrules collide as solids (and hence usually
bounce), coalescence times for droplets of appropriate composition are measured
in tens of seconds. Even at 1025K, at which temperature theory predicts that
the chondrules must have collided extremely slowly to have stuck together, the
coalescence time scale is still less than an hour. These coalescence time
scales are too short for the collision of molten chondrules to explain the
observed frequency of compound chondrules. We suggest instead a scenario where
chondrules stuck together in slow collisions while fully solid; and the
resulting chondrule pair was subsequently briefly heated to a temperature in
the range of 900-1025K. In that temperature window the coalescence time is
finite but long, covering a span of hours to a decade. This is particularly
interesting because those temperatures are precisely the critical window for
thermally ionized MRI activity, so compound chondrules provide a possible probe
into that vital regime.

including three possible regimes for the fermionic species: fully polarized,
BCS, and unitarity. Starting from the 3D description and using the variational
approximation (VA), we derive 1D and 2D systems of equations, under the
corresponding confining potentials. This method produces a pair of nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) equations coupled to algebraic equations for the
transverse widths of the confined state. The equations incorporate interactions
between atoms of the same species and between the species, assuming that the
latter can be manipulated by means of the Feshbach resonance (FR). As an
application, we explore spatial density correlations in the ground state (GS)
between the species, concluding that they strongly depend on the sign and
strength of the inter-species interaction. Also studied are the dynamics of the
mixture in a vicinity of the GS and the corresponding spatiotemporal
inter-species correlation. The correlations are strongly affected by the
fermionic component, featuring the greatest variation in the unitary regime.
Results produced by the VA are verified by comparison with full numerical
solutions.

the Sun's corona, and in particular the structure of the boundary between open
and closed magnetic flux. Moreover, recent developments indicate that magnetic
reconnection in the corona likely occurs in highly fragmented current layers,
and that this typically leads to a dramatic increase in the topological
complexity beyond that of the equilibrium field. In this paper we investigate
the consequences of reconnection at the open-closed flux boundary (""interchange
reconnection"") in a fragmented current layer. We demonstrate that it leads to a
situation in which magnetic flux (and therefore plasma) from open and closed
field regions is efficiently mixed together. This corresponds to an increase in
the length and complexity of the open-closed boundary. Thus, whenever
reconnection occurs at a null point or separator of the open-closed boundary,
the associated separatrix arc of the so-called ""S-web"" in the high corona
becomes not a single line but a band of finite thickness within which the
open-closed flux boundary is highly structured. This has significant
implications for the acceleration of the slow solar wind, for which the
interaction of open and closed field is thought to be important, and may also
explain the coronal origins of certain solar energetic particles. The
topological structures examined contain magnetic null points, separatrices and
separators, and include a model for a pseudo-streamer. The potential for
understanding both the large scale morphology and fine structure observed in
flare ribbons associated with coronal nulls is also discussed.

potential application in ultramicroscopy, because of its sub-wavelength
resolution that can enhance detection and interaction with matter. For these
novel applications under development, the optical trapping of a sphere acts as
an ideal framework to employ photonic nanojets. In the present study, we
generated nanojets by using a highly focused incident beam, in contrast to
traditional plane waves. The method inherits the advantage of optical trapping,
especially for intracellular applications, with the microsphere in equilibrium
on the beam propagation axis and positioned arbitrarily in space. Moreover,
owing to optical scattering forces, when the sphere is in equilibrium, its
center shifts with respect to the focal point of the incident beam. However,
when the system is in stable equilibrium with a configuration involving optical
tweezers, photonic nanojets cannot be formed. To overcome this issue, we
employed double optical tweezers in an unorthodox configuration involving two
collinear and co-propagating beams, the precise positioning of which would turn
on/off the photonic nanojets, thereby improving the applicability of photonic
nanojets.

trains that propagate in opposite directions along the tube. These wave packets
disperse as they propagate, where the extent of dispersion depends on the
physical properties of the magnetic structure, on the length of the initial
excitation, and on its nature (e.g., transverse or axisymmetric). In Oliver et
al. (2014) we considered a transverse initial perturbation, whereas the
temporal evolution of an axisymmetric one is examined here. In both papers we
use a method based on Fourier integrals to solve the initial value problem.
Previous studies on wave propagation in magnetic wave guides have emphasized
that the wave train dispersion is influenced by the particular dependence of
the group velocity on the longitudinal wavenumber. Here we also find that long
initial perturbations result in low amplitude wave packets and that large
values of the magnetic tube to environment density ratio yield longer wave
trains. To test the detectability of propagating transverse or axisymmetric
wave packets in magnetic tubes of the solar atmosphere (e.g., coronal loops,

presence of liquid water in a snowpack is presented. The method is based on
Biot's theory of wave propagation in porous materials. Empirical relations and
a priori information is used to characterize snow as a porous material as a
function of porosity. Plane wave theory and an equivalent pore fluid are used
to solve Biot's differential equations and to asses the impact of the air and
water in the pore space. The liquid water in the pore space of a snow pack
reduces the velocity of the first compressional wave by roughly 300 m/s for
every 0.1 increase in liquid water saturation. Also the attenuation of the
compressional waves is increased with increasing liquid water content. Two end
member models for compaction are evaluated to asses the importance of an
independent density measurement for an estimate of liquid pore water saturation
in snow with acoustic waves. The two end members correspond to no compaction at
all and to a melting sphere packing where the grains remain in contact. The
change of velocity for the first compressional wave was found to strongly
depend on the compaction model, while the velocity of the second compressional
wave mainly depends on liquid water saturation. Also the attenuation for both
compressional waves depends mainly on the liquid water saturation and only
little on the compaction model. Finally, a simple field experiment illustrates
the potential use of the method to estimate the liquid water content of snow
with acoustic sensors.

sampling H-colourings is #BIS-hard, but it was not known how to get the result

We analysed time-averaged, flux-selected, and time-resolved spectra. Despite
the strong variability in flux during our observational campaign, the
broad-band spectral shape of Ark 564 does not vary dramatically and can be
reproduced either by a superposition of a power law and a blackbody emission or
by a Comptonized power-law emission model. High-resolution spectroscopy
revealed ionised gas along the line of sight at the systemic redshift of the
source, with a low column density and a range of ionisation states. Broad-band
spectroscopy revealed a very steep intrinsic continuum and a rather weak
emission feature in the iron K band; modelling this feature with a reflection
component requires highly ionised gas. A reflection-dominated or an
absorption-dominated model are similarly able to well reproduce the
time-averaged data from a statistical point of view, in both cases requiring
contrived geometries and/or unlikely physical parameters. Finally, through
time-resolved analysis we spectroscopically identified the ""delayed"" emission

appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in
taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches
its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned'
galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding a
descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall'

the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are
qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a
strong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\sim (1+z)^{2.4-2.8}$, a
power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on
descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar
masses greater than $\sim 2 \times 10^{11} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$. These trends
are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies

selecting galaxies whose host haloes are preferentially undergoing major
mergers. Applying the method to central L* (10^10 Msun < M_* < 10^10.5 Msun)
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at z<0.06, we find that major
halo mergers can at most modestly reduce the star-forming fraction, from 59% to
47%. Consistent with past research, however, mergers accompany enhanced
specific star formation rates for star-forming L* centrals: ~10% when a paired
galaxy is within 200 kpc (approximately the host halo's virial radius),
climbing to ~70% when a paired galaxy is within 30 kpc. No evidence is seen for
even extremely close pairs (<30 kpc separation) rejuvenating star formation in
quenched galaxies. For galaxy formation models, our results suggest: (1)
quenching in L* galaxies likely begins due to decoupling of the galaxy from
existing hot and cold gas reservoirs, rather than a lack of available gas or
gravitational heating from infalling clumps, (2) state-of-the-art semi-analytic

significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light
curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES and LSST). The light curves in each band are
modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared
across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which
drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all
bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base
model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the
effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. We use
simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to
demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the

analysis of the relativistic tidal disruption event candidate Sw J2058+05 from

its behavior with that of Sw J1644+57. Our main results are as follows. (1) The
long-term X-ray light curve of Sw J2058+05 shows a remarkably similar trend to
that of Sw J1644+57. After a prolonged power-law decay, the X-ray flux drops
off rapidly by a factor of $\gtrsim 160$ within a span of $\Delta$$t$/$t$ $\le$
0.95. Associating this sudden decline with the transition from super-Eddington
to sub-Eddington accretion, we estimate the black hole mass to be in the range
of $10^{4-6}$ M$_{\odot}$. (2) We detect rapid ($\lesssim 500$ s) X-ray
variability before the dropoff, suggesting that, even at late times, the X-rays
originate from close to the black hole (ruling out a forward-shock origin). (3)
We confirm using HST and VLBA astrometry that the location of the source
coincides with the galaxy's center to within $\lesssim 400$ pc (in projection).
(4) We modeled Sw J2058+05's ultraviolet/optical/infrared spectral energy
distribution with a single-temperature blackbody and find that while the radius
remains more or less constant at a value of $63.4 \pm 4.5$ AU ($\sim 10^{15}$
cm) at all times during the outburst, the blackbody temperature drops
significantly from $\sim$ 30,000 K at early times to a value of $\sim$ 15,000 K
at late times (before the X-ray dropoff). Our results strengthen Sw J2058+05's
interpretation as a tidal disruption event similar to Sw J1644+57.

the time span between epochs ranging from a few hours to ~2 years. During the

min-to-max amplitude of 13%, while the second epoch light curve taken ~2 years
later did not note any variability to a 3% upper limit. With an effective
temperature of ~600 K, WISE0458 is the coldest variable brown dwarf published

no significant variations, with a photometric precision between 0.8% and 20.0%,

star formation laws. Yet, it is not clear whether and how the measure of star
formation is affected by the spatial scale at which a galaxy is observed. Aims.
We want to understand the impact of the resolution on the determination of the
spatially resolved star formation rate (SFR) and other directly associated
physical parameters such as the attenuation. Methods. We have carried out a
multi-scale, pixel-by-pixel study of the nearby galaxy M33. Assembling FUV,
Halpha, 8, 24, 70, and 100 micron maps, we have systematically compared the
emission in individual bands with various SFR estimators from a resolution of
33 pc to 2084 pc. Results. We have found that there are strong,
scale-dependent, discrepancies up to a factor 3 between monochromatic SFR
estimators and Halpha+24 micron. The scaling factors between individual IR
bands and the SFR show a strong dependence on the spatial scale and on the
intensity of star formation. Finally, strong variations of the differential
reddening between the nebular emission and the stellar continuum are seen,
depending on the specific SFR (sSFR) and on the resolution. At the finest
spatial scales, there is little differential reddening at high sSFR. The
differential reddening increases with decreasing sSFR. At the coarsest spatial
scales the differential reddening is compatible with the canonical value found
for starburst galaxies. Conclusions. Our results confirm that monochromatic
estimators of the SFR are unreliable at scales smaller than 1 kpc. Furthermore,
the extension of local calibrations to high redshift galaxies presents
non-trivial challenges as the properties of these systems may be poorly known.

that observed LAHs cannot be accounted for solely by photons originating from
the central LAE and scattered to large radii by hydrogen atoms in the
circumgalactic gas. Instead, Ly$\alpha$ emission from regions in the outer halo
is primarily responsible for producing the extended LAHs seen in observations,
which potentially includes both star-forming and cooling radiation. With the
limit on the star formation contribution set by the ultra-violet (UV) halo
measurement, we find that cooling radiation can play an important role in
forming the extended LAHs. We discuss the implications and caveats of such a
picture.

revolutionize our understanding of astrophysical transients. Here we evaluate
the prospects of a wide range of planned and hypothetical radio surveys using
the properties and volumetric rates of known and hypothetical classes of
extragalactic synchrotron radio transients (e.g., on- and off-axis gamma-ray
bursts [GRB], supernovae, tidal disruption events [TDE], compact object
mergers). Utilizing these sources and physically motivated considerations we
assess the allowed phase-space of radio luminosity and peak timescale for
extragalactic transients. We also include for the first time effects such as
redshift evolution of the rates, K-corrections, and non-Euclidean luminosity
distance, which affect the detection rates of the most sensitive surveys. The
number of detected events is calculated by means of a Monte Carlo method, using
the various survey properties (depth, cadence, area) and realistic detection
criteria that include a cut on the minimum variability of the transients during
the survey and an assessment of host galaxy contamination. Near-term GHz
frequency surveys (ASKAP/VAST, Very Large Array Sky Survey) will detect few
events: <~30-50 on- and off-axis long GRBs and off-axis tidal disruption
events, and ~10-20 neutron star binary mergers if ~1% of the mergers result in
a stable millisecond magnetar. Low-frequency surveys (e.g., LOFAR) are unlikely
to detect any transients, while a hypothetical large-scale mm survey may detect
~40 on-axis long GRBs. On the other hand, SKA surveys at ~0.1-1 GHz have the
potential to uncover thousands of transients, mainly on- and off-axis long
GRBs, on-axis short GRBs, off-axis TDEs, and neutron star binary mergers with
magnetar remnants.

To exploit the potential benefits of structures with such `addressable

kinetics of self-assembly. Here we use a simple theoretical method to explain
the key features responsible for the unexpected success of DNA-brick
experiments, which are currently the only demonstration of reliable
self-assembly with such a large number of components. Simulations confirm that
our theory accurately predicts the narrow temperature window in which
error-free assembly can occur. Even more strikingly, our theory predicts that
correct assembly of the complete structure may require a time-dependent
experimental protocol. Furthermore, we predict that low coordination numbers
result in non-classical nucleation behavior, which we find to be essential for
achieving optimal nucleation kinetics under mild growth conditions. We also
show that, rather surprisingly, the use of heterogeneous bond energies improves
the nucleation kinetics and in fact appears to be necessary for assembling
certain intricate three-dimensional structures. This observation makes it
possible to sculpt nucleation pathways by tuning the distribution of
interaction strengths. These insights not only suggest how to improve the
design of structures based on DNA bricks, but also point the way toward the
creation of a much wider class of chemical or colloidal structures with
addressable complexity.

allow for log N(H2) to be as high as 18.9. The rotational excitation
temperature of H2 in this component is 133 +33/-22 K. Photoionization models
suggest 30-80% of the total N(H I) is associated with the strong H2 component,
that has a density <= 100 cm^-3 and is subject to a radiation field that is <=
0.5 times the Galactic mean field. The Very Large Baseline Array 1.4 GHz

carried out for axisymmetric viscous/diffusive disc accretion to rotating

or jets are asymmetric relative to the equatorial plane. We consider initial
magnetic fields that are symmetric about the equatorial plane and consist of a
radially distributed field threading the disc (disc-field) and a stellar dipole
field.({\bf 1}). For pure disc-fields the symmetry or asymmetry of the outflows
is affected by the midplane plasma $\beta$ of the disc (where $\beta$ is the
ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure). For the low density
discs with small plasma $\beta$ values, outflows are observed to be symmetric
to within $10\%$ over timescales of hundreds of inner disc orbits. For the
denser higher $\beta$ discs, the coupling of the upper and lower coronal
plasmas is broken, and quasi-periodic field motion in the two hemispheres
becomes different. This asymmetry leads to asymmetric episodic outflows. ({\bf
2.}) Accreting stars with a stellar dipole field and no disc-field exhibit
episodic, two component outflows - a magnetospheric wind and an inner disc wind
from somewhat larger radial distances. Both are characterized by similar
velocity profiles but the magnetospheric wind has densities $\gtrsim 10$ times
that of the disc wind. ({\bf 3}.)Adding a disc-field parallel to the stellar
dipole field acts to enhance the magnetospheric winds but suppress the disc
wind. ({\bf 4}.) In contrast, adding a disc-field which is anti-parallel to the

size of threshold corrections needed at the high scale (e.g., the indices of
high-scale representations) and provides precise quantitative data needed to
test the viability of hypothesized high-scale unification theories. Such an
approach shows more clearly the reasonable prospects of non-supersymmetric
grand unification in large rank groups, and also shows the low summed values of
high-scale threshold corrections required for supersymmetric unification. The
latter may imply tuned cancellations of high-scale thresholds in theories based
on weak-scale supersymmetry. For that reason we view non-supersymmetric
unification to be just as viable as supersymmetric unification when confining
ourselves only to the question of reasonable high-scale threshold corrections
needed for exact unification. We illustrate these features for a
non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ graund unified theory and a supersymmetric $SU(5)$

realistic inflation in the maximal gauged supergravity. In this paper, we
address this problem in the framework of recently discovered 1-parameter
deformation of ${\rm SO}(4,4)$ and ${\rm SO}(5,3)$ dyonic gaugings, for which
the base point of the scalar manifold corresponds to an unstable de Sitter
critical point. In the gauge-field frame where the embedding tensor takes the
value in the sum of the {\bf 36} and {\bf 36'} representations of ${\rm
SL}(8)$, we present a scheme that allows us to derive an analytic expression
for the scalar potential. With the help of this formalism, we derive the full
potential and gauge coupling functions in analytic forms for the ${\rm
SO}(3)\times {\rm SO}(3)$-invariant subsectors of ${\rm SO}(4,4)$ and ${\rm
SO}(5,3)$ gaugings, and argue that there exist no new critical points in
addition to those discovered so far. For the ${\rm SO}(4,4)$ gauging, we also
study the behavior of 6-dimensional scalar fields in this sector near the
Dall'Agata-Inverso de Sitter critical point at which the negative eigenvalue of
the scalar mass square with the largest modulus goes to zero as the deformation
parameter approaches a critical value. We find that when the deformation
parameter is taken sufficiently close to the critical value, inflation lasts
more than 60 e-folds even if the initial point of the inflaton allows an
$O(0.1)$ deviation in Planck units from the Dall'Agata-Inverso critical point.
It turns out that the spectral index $n_s$ of the curvature perturbation at the
time of the 60 e-folding number is always about 0.96 and within the $1\sigma$
range $n_s=0.9639\pm0.0047$ obtained by Planck, irrespective of the value of
the $\eta$ parameter at the critical saddle point. The tensor-scalar ratio
predicted by this model is around $10^{-3}$ and is close to the value in the
Starobinsky model.

new models increases quickly together with their computational demands. Despite
the growing performance of modern computers and clusters, calibration of such
models from noisy experimental data remains a nontrivial and often
computationally exhaustive task. The layered neural networks thus represent a
robust and efficient technique to overcome the time-consuming simulations of a
calibrated model. The potential of neural networks consists in simple
implementation and high versatility in approximating nonlinear relationships.
Therefore, there were several approaches proposed to accelerate the calibration
of nonlinear models by neural networks. This contribution reviews and compares
three possible strategies based on approximating (i) model response, (ii)
inverse relationship between the model response and its parameters and (iii)
error function quantifying how well the model fits the data. The advantages and
drawbacks of particular strategies are demonstrated on the calibration of four
parameters of the affinity hydration model from simulated data as well as from
experimental measurements. This model is highly nonlinear, but computationally
cheap thus allowing its calibration without any approximation and better
quantification of results obtained by the examined calibration strategies. The
paper can be thus viewed as a guide intended for the engineers to help them
select an appropriate strategy in their particular calibration problems.

non-X-ray and cosmic X-ray backgrounds, the 2--10~keV X-ray intensity
distribution is found to monotonically decrease with increasing Galactic
latitude. This indicates that most of the extended emission detected by Suzaku
originates from the Galactic ridge. In two observations, we derive upper limits
of $3.4 \times 10^{-8}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~sr^{-1}}$ and $1.3 \times
10^{-8}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~sr^{-1}}$ to X-ray emission in the 2--10 keV
range from the gamma-ray cocoon. These limits exclude the presence of
cosmic-ray electrons with energies above about 50 TeV at a flux level capable
of explaining the gamma-ray spectrum. They are consistent with the emission
cut-off observed near a TeV in gamma rays. The properties of Galactic ridge and
local diffuse X-rays are also discussed.

is one of the most fundamental processes in magnetized plasmas. In most
astrophysical environments the Reynolds numbers are large and therefore the
transition to turbulence is inevitable. This turbulence must be taken into
account for any theory of magnetic reconnection, since the initially laminar
configurations can transit to the turbulence state, what is demonstrated by 3D
high resolution numerical simulations. We discuss ideas of how turbulence can
modify reconnection with the focus on the Lazarian & Vishniac (1999)
reconnection model and present numerical evidence supporting the model and
demonstrate that it is closely connected to the concept of Richardson diffusion
and compatible with the Lagrangian dynamics of magnetized fluids. We point out
that the Generalized Ohm's Law, that accounts for turbulent motion, predicts
the subdominance of the microphysical plasma effects for a realistically
turbulent media. We show that on of the most dramatic consequences of
turbulence is the violation of the generally accepted notion of magnetic flux
freezing. This notion is a corner stone of most theories dealing with
magnetized plasmas and therefore its change induces fundamental shifts in
accepted paradigms like turbulent reconnection entailing the diffusion process
that is essential for understanding star formation. We argue, that at
sufficiently high Reynolds numbers the process of tearing reconnection should
transfer to turbulent reconnection. We discuss flares predicted by turbulent
reconnection and relate them to solar flares and gamma ray bursts. We analyze
solar observations, measurements in the solar wind or heliospheric current
sheet, and show their correspondence with turbulent reconnection predictions.
Finally, we discuss 1st Order Fermi acceleration as a natural consequence of
the turbulent reconnection.

Potts-Markov random fields with unknown regularisation parameters, with
application to fast unsupervised K-class image segmentation. The technique is
derived by first removing the regularisation parameter from the Bayesian model
by marginalisation, followed by a small-variance-asymptotic (SVA) analysis in
which the spatial regularisation and the integer-constrained terms of the Potts
model are decoupled. The evaluation of this SVA Bayesian estimator is then
relaxed into a problem that can be computed efficiently by iteratively solving
a convex total-variation denoising problem and a least-squares clustering
(K-means) problem, both of which can be solved straightforwardly, even in
high-dimensions, and with parallel computing techniques. This leads to a fast
fully unsupervised Bayesian image segmentation methodology in which the
strength of the spatial regularisation is adapted automatically to the observed
image during the inference procedure, and that can be easily applied in large
2D and 3D scenarios or in applications requiring low computing times.
Experimental results on real images, as well as extensive comparisons with
state-of-the-art algorithms, confirm that the proposed methodology offer
extremely fast convergence and produces accurate segmentation results, with the
important additional advantage of self-adjusting regularisation parameters.

for the in silico exploration of transcriptional regulatory interactions
through the integration of high-throughput -omics data. A major limitation of
previous approaches is their inability to handle conditional and synergistic
interactions that emerge when collectively analysing genes subject to different
regulatory mechanisms. This limitation reduces overall predictive power and
thus the reliability of downstream biological inference.
  Results: We introduce an analytical modelling framework (TREEOME: tree of
models of expression) that integrates epigenetic and transcriptomic data by
separating genes into putative regulatory classes. Current predictive modelling
approaches have found both DNA methylation and histone modification epigenetic
data to provide little or no improvement in accuracy of prediction of
transcript abundance despite, for example, distinct anti-correlation between
mRNA levels and promoter-localised DNA methylation. To improve on this, in
TREEOME we evaluate four possible methods of formulating gene-level DNA
methylation metrics, which provide a foundation for identifying gene-level
methylation events and subsequent differential analysis, whereas most previous
techniques operate at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides. We demonstrate
TREEOME by integrating gene-level DNA methylation (bisulfite-seq) and histone
modification (ChIP-seq) data to accurately predict genome-wide mRNA transcript
abundance (RNA-seq) for H1-hESC and GM12878 cell lines.

possibility to tackle the cosmological constant problem in its various facets.
Furthermore, for a long time (most prominently since Dirac's first proposal on
a time variable gravitational coupling) the possibility that the fundamental

continuously investigated. In the last two decades, and specially in recent

the possible time variation of the fundamental constants are two manifestations

Newton's coupling and the masses of all the particles in the Universe, both the

integrating what is learned is subject to the curse of dimensionality. This
paper develops and analyzes algorithms that allow efficient learning and
decision-making while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We formalize the
information available to the learner/decision-maker at a particular time as a
context vector which the learner should consider when taking actions. In
general the context vector is very high dimensional, but in many settings, the
most relevant information is embedded into only a few relevant dimensions. If
these relevant dimensions were known in advance, the problem would be simple --
but they are not. Moreover, the relevant dimensions may be different for
different actions. Our algorithm learns the relevant dimensions for each
action, and makes decisions based in what it has learned. Formally, we build on
the structure of a contextual multi-armed bandit by adding and exploiting a
relevance relation. We prove a general regret bound for our algorithm whose
time order depends only on the maximum number of relevant dimensions among all
the actions, which in the special case where the relevance relation is
single-valued (a function), reduces to $\tilde{O}(T^{2(\sqrt{2}-1)})$; in the
absence of a relevance relation, the best known contextual bandit algorithms
achieve regret $\tilde{O}(T^{(D+1)/(D+2)})$, where $D$ is the full dimension of

atmospheric thermal noise but suggest a sudden atmospheric temperature increase
like the deglaciation period following a possible ""snowball Earth"" near the end
of the Precambrian would break this resonance; the Marinoan and Sturtian
glaciations seem the most likely candidates for this event. Our model provides
a simulated day length over time that resembles existing paleorotational data,
though further data is needed to verify this hypothesis.

related tasks. The current state-of-the-art feature learning paradigm is
supervised learning from labeled data. However, this paradigm requires
large-scale category labels, which limits its applicability to domains where
labels are hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven feature
learning paradigm which does not rely on category labels. Instead, we learn
from user behavior data collected on social media. Concretely, we use the image
relationship discovered in the latent space from the user behavior data to
guide the image feature learning. We collect a large-scale image and user
behavior dataset from Behance.net. The dataset consists of 1.9 million images
and over 300 million view records from 1.9 million users. We validate our
feature learning paradigm on this dataset and find that the learned feature
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art image features in learning
better image similarities. We also show that the learned feature performs
competitively on various recognition benchmarks.

microchannel geometry on neuronal cultures and to maintain these cultures for
long period of time (over several weeks) inside the closed microchannels of
cellular scale dimensions.
  Methods: The primary hippocampal neurons from E-18 rat were cultured inside
the closed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels of varying sizes. The
effect of the channel geometry on the spatial and the temporal variations in
the neural microenvironment was investigated by studying neural maturation and
variation in the media osmolality respectively. The cultures were maintained
for longer time spans by PDMS device pretreatment, control on media evaporation
(by using hydrophobic ethylene propylene membrane) and an effective culture
maintenance protocol. Further, the devices were integrated with the planar
microelectrode arrays (MEA) to record spontaneous electrical activity.
  Results: A direct influence of channel geometry on neuron maturation was
observed with cells in smaller channels maturing faster. The temporal variation
in the microenvironment was caused by several fold increase in osmolality
within 2-3 days due to rapid media evaporation. With our culture methodology,
neurons were maintained in the closed channels as small as 50 microns in height
and width for over 1 month in serum free media condition and the time varying
spontaneous electrical activity was measured for up to 5 weeks using the MEA.
  Conclusions: The understanding of the effect of the culture scale on cellular
microenvironment and such long-term culture maintenance will be helpful in
studying neuronal tissue development; therapeutic drug screening; and for
network level neuronal analysis.

results of vertex-transitive graphs including many known networks. A
$k$-regular connected vertex-transitive graph has matching preclusion number
$k$ and is super matched except for six classes of graphs. From this many

show that the electron density profiles retrieved from the S-band data are more
analogous to the dual-frequency data in the profile shape, compared with the
X-band data. Generally, the S-band results slightly underestimate the magnitude
of the peak density, while the X-band results overestimate that. The
discrepancy in the X-band profile is probably due to the relatively larger
unmodeled orbital errors. It is also expected that the ionopause height is
sensitive to the solar wind dynamical pressure in high and intermediate solar
activities, usually in the range of 200 km - 1000 km on the dayside and much
higher on the nightside. Structural variations (""bulges"" and fluctuations) can
be found in the electron density profiles in intermediate solar activity, which
may be caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere.
Considerable ionizations can be observed in the Venus' nightside ionosphere,
which are unexpected for the Martian nightside ionosphere in most cases.

we tackle this problem by designing a novel phrase-based language model which
attempts to solve three key sub-problems: 1, how to define a phrase in language

data in order to enlarge the training set; 3, how to alleviate the data
sparsity problem due to the huge vocabulary size of phrases. By carefully

system (AFHS) to transport surging air cargo. Energy-efficient routing of such
vehicles is of great interest for both financial and environmental
sustainability. Given a multi-capacity RGV working on a linear track in AFHS,
we consider its optimal routing under two-sided loading/unloading (TSLU)
operations, in which energy consumption is minimized under conflict-avoidance
and time window constraints. The energy consumption takes account of
routing-dependent gross weight and dynamics of the RGV, and the
conflict-avoidance constraints ensure conflict-free transport service under
TSLU operations. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program,
and solved by incorporating valid inequalities that exploit structural
properties of the problem. The static problem model and solution approach are
then integrated with a rolling-horizon approach to solve the dynamic routing
problem where air cargo enters and departs from the system dynamically in time.
Simulation results suggest that the proposed strategy is able to route an RGV
to transport air cargo with an energy cost that is considerably lower than one
of the most commonly used heuristic methods implemented in current practice.

  using Single Cell Tower Information","5 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting the transportation mode of a user is important for a wide range of
applications. While a number of recent systems addressed the transportation
mode detection problem using the ubiquitous mobile phones, these studies either
leverage GPS, the inertial sensors, and/or multiple cell towers information.
However, these different phone sensors have high energy consumption, limited to
a small subset of phones (e.g. high-end phones or phones that support
neighbouring cell tower information), cannot work in certain areas (e.g. inside
tunnels for GPS), and/or work only from the user side.
  In this paper, we present a transportation mode detection system, MonoSense,
that leverages the phone serving cell information only. The basic idea is that
the phone speed can be correlated with features extracted from both the serving
cell tower ID and the received signal strength from it. To achieve high
detection accuracy with this limited information, MonoSense leverages diversity
along multiple axes to extract novel features. Specifically, MonoSense extracts
features from both the time and frequency domain information available from the
serving cell tower over different sliding widow sizes. More importantly, we
show also that both the logarithmic and linear RSS scales can provide different
information about the movement of a phone, further enriching the feature space
and leading to higher accuracy.
  Evaluation of MonoSense using 135 hours of cellular traces covering 485 km
and collected by four users using different Android phones shows that it can
achieve an average precision and recall of 89.26% and 89.84% respectively in
differentiating between the stationary, walking, and driving modes using only
the serving cell tower information, highlighting MonoSense ability to enable a
wide set of intelligent transportation applications.

consider the optimal PEV charging scheduling, where the non-causal information
about future PEV arrivals is not known in advance, but its statistical
information can be estimated. This leads to an ""online"" charging scheduling
problem that is naturally formulated as a finite-horizon dynamic programming

$O(T^3)$, where $T$ is the total number of time stages. We rigorously analyze
the performance gap between the near-optimal solution of the MPC-based approach

Furthermore, our rigorous analysis shows that when the random process
describing the arrival of charging demands is first-order periodic, the
complexity of proposed algorithm can be reduced to $O(1)$, which is independent
of $T$. Extensive simulations show that the proposed online algorithm performs
very closely to the optimal online algorithm. The performance gap is smaller

this analogy, we suggest that acausal diagrams resulting from the fermionic

can alleviate this problem in a simple and elegant way, i.e., by leading to
exact cancellations of harmful diagrams, to all orders of perturbation theory,

true for a super Yang-Mills model, but in this case, other important acausal
diagrams are also originating from supersymmetric D-terms. As a consequence, we
conjecture that, for a generic gauge theory, an infinite number of superfields
are needed in order to obtain a complete cancellation between all diagrams.
This framework is naturally occurring in string theory, where infinite
Kaluza-Klein towers of higher-spin fields are generally predicted.

Mercury is unique since its spin rate is exactly 1.5 its mean motion (3:2

reached after damping of the initial rotation of the relevant bodies. Thus, the
rotation quantities are a signature of the interior, in particular of a
putative global ocean. This manuscript divides into 3 parts. The first part is
devoted to the synchronous resonance. It presents different models of rotation
from a fully rigid body to a one with a global subsurfacic ocean. We always
consider all the degrees of freedom simultaneously, using analytical and

propagation methods have been developed to exploit pairwise constraints for
cluster analysis. However, since most of these methods have a polynomial time
complexity, they are not much suitable for segmentation of images even with a
moderate size, which is actually equivalent to cluster analysis with a large
data size. Considering the local homogeneousness of a natural image, we choose
to perform pairwise constraint propagation only over a selected subset of
pixels, but not over the whole image. Such a selective constraint propagation
problem is then solved by an efficient graph-based learning algorithm. To
further speed up our selective constraint propagation, we also discard those
less important propagated constraints during graph-based learning. Finally, the
selectively propagated constraints are exploited based on $L_1$-minimization
for normalized cuts over the whole image. The experimental results demonstrate
the promising performance of the proposed method for segmentation with
selectively propagated constraints.

jellium model, whose predictions -- divergent derivative of the energy
dispersion relation and vanishing density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level --
are in qualitative disagreement with experimental evidence for simple metals.
Currently, this qualitative failure is attributed to the lack of screening in
the HF equations. Employing Slater's hyper-Hartree-Fock (HHF) equations,
derived variationally, to study the ground state and the excited states of
jellium, we find that the divergent derivative of the energy dispersion
relation and the zero in the DOS are still present, but shifted from the Fermi
wavevector and energy of jellium to the boundary between the set of
variationally optimised and unoptimised HHF orbitals. The location of this
boundary is not fixed, but it can be chosen to lie at arbitrarily high values
of wavevector and energy, well clear from the Fermi level of jellium. We
conclude that, rather than the lack of screening in the HF equations, the
well-known qualitative failure of the ground-state HF approximation is an
artifact of its nonlocal exchange operator. Other similar artifacts of the HF
nonlocal exchange operator, not associated with the lack of electronic
correlation, are known in the literature.

Multi RAT DenseNet solves problems such as coverage holes and low performance

consequent high signaling load. In this work, we propose an effective RAT
selection algorithm that efficiently manages the RAT handover procedure by
\emph{(i)} choosing the most suitable RAT that guarantees high system and user
performance, and \emph{(ii)} reducing unnecessary handover events. In
particular, the decision to trigger a handover is based on a new system
parameter named Reference Base Station Efficiency (RBSE). This parameter takes
into account metrics related to both the system and the user: the BS
transmitted power, the BS traffic load and the users' spectral efficiency. We
compare, by simulation, the proposed scheme with the standardized 3GPP
policies. Results show that the proposed RAT selection scheme significantly

requirements for space applications. Its full-custom front-end electronics is
designed to work over a large energy range from 2 keV to 1 MeV with excellent
spectroscopic performances, in particular between 10 and 100 keV (0.56 keV FWHM
and 0.67 keV FWHM at 13.9 and 59.5 keV). In the frame of the ORIGAMIX project,
a consortium based on research laboratories and industrials has been settled in
order to develop a new generation of gamma camera. The aim is to develop a
system based on the Caliste architecture for post-accidental interventions or
homeland security, but integrating new properties (advanced spectrometry,
hybrid working mode) and suitable for industry. A first prototype was designed
and tested to acquire feedback for further developments. In this study, we
particularly focused on spectrometric performances with high energies and high
fluxes. Therefore, our device was exposed to energies up to 700 keV (133Ba,
137Cs) and we measured the evolution of energy resolution (0.96 keV at 80 keV,
2.18 keV at 356 keV, 3.33 keV at 662 keV). Detection efficiency decreases after
150 keV, as Compton effect becomes dominant. However, CALISTE is also designed
to handle multiple events, enabling Compton scattering reconstruction, which
can drastically improve detection efficiencies and dynamic range for higher
energies up to 1408 keV (22Na, 60Co, 152Eu) within a 1-mm thick detector. In
particular, such spectrometric performances obtained with 152Eu and 60Co were

pattern defines an abstraction relation between an observation hypothesis and a

generated abductively from any subset of the evidence of a pattern, building an
abstraction hierarchy of observations in which higher levels contain those
observations with greater interpretative value of the physiological processes
underlying a given signal. Non-monotonic reasoning techniques have been applied
to this model in order to find the best interpretation of a set of initial
observations, permitting even to correct these observations by removing, adding
or modifying them in order to make them consistent with the available domain
knowledge. Some preliminary experiments have been conducted to apply this
framework to a well known and bounded problem: the QRS detection on ECG
signals. The objective is not to provide a new better QRS detector, but to test
the validity of an abductive paradigm. These experiments show that a knowledge
base comprising just a few very simple rhythm abstraction patterns can enhance
the results of a state of the art algorithm by significantly improving its
detection F1-score, besides proving the ability of the abductive framework to
correct both sensitivity and specificity failures.

perturbed evolution problems, one often encounters that the Evans function
respects the scale separation. In such cases the Evans function of the full
linear stability problem can be approximated by a product of a slow and a fast
reduced Evans function, which correspond to properly scaled slow and fast
singular limit problems. This feature has been used in several spectral
stability analyses in order to reduce the complexity of the linear stability
problem. In these studies the factorization of the Evans function was
established via geometric arguments that need to be customized for the specific
equations and solutions under consideration. In this paper we develop an
alternative factorization method. In this analytic method we use the Riccati
transformation and exponential dichotomies to separate slow from fast dynamics.
We employ our factorization procedure to study the spectra associated with
spatially periodic pulse solutions to a general class of multi-component,
singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. Eventually, we obtain
expressions of the slow and fast reduced Evans functions, which describe the
spectrum in the singular limit. The spectral stability of localized periodic
patterns has so far only been investigated in specific models such as the
Gierer-Meinhardt equations. Our spectral analysis significantly extends and
formalizes these existing results. Moreover, it leads to explicit instability
criteria.

energy is regularized and expressed with cylinder kernel coefficients by using
the first-order perturbation theory. When the refraction index of the medium is
smoothly inhomogeneous (i.e., derivatives of all orders exist), logarithmically
cutoff-dependent term in Casimir energy is found. We show that in the piston
model this term vanishes in the force and thus the Casimir force is always
cutoff-independent, but this term will remain in the force in the half-space

\mapsto \ell^\infty(X)$ for locally compact Hausdorff $X$ having a countable
basis? Making the ansatz $K(\ell^2) \mapsto B(\ell^2)$, we expect that every
unital $*$-homomorphism $C(\mathbb T) \rightarrow B(\ell^2)$ extend canonically
to a unital $*$-homomorphism $\ell^\infty(\mathbb T) \rightarrow B(\ell^2)$.
Thus, we expect to extend the continuous functional calculus for a unitary
operator on $\ell^2$ to all bounded complex-valued functions.
  Therefore, we work in a model of set theory where every set of real numbers
is Lebesgue measurable; we must assume the consistency of an inaccessible
cardinal in order to do so. The axiom of choice necessarily fails in such a
model, but our model is carefully chosen to enable the verification of many
familiar theorems via a scrutinization of their statements rather than their
proofs. This technique significantly lowers the cost of doing interesting
mathematics in this unfamiliar setting, and it is explained in detail.
  By analogy with the ultraweak topology, we define the continuum-weak topology
on bounded operators to be the topology given by functionals of the form $x
\mapsto \int_0^1 <\eta_t| x \xi_t>\, dt$. We then define a V*-algebra to be a
C*-algebra of bounded operators that is closed in the continuum-weak topology.
Every C*-algebra $A$ has an enveloping V*-algebra $V^*(A)$, and if $X$ is a
locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable basis, then $V^*(C_0(X)) \cong
\ell^\infty(X)$. More generally, if $A$ is any separable C*-algebra of type I,
then $V^*(A)$ is canonically isomorphic to an $\ell^\infty$-direct sum of type
I factors, with one summand for each irreducible representation of $A$. The
self-adjoint part of any unital separable C*-algebra is isomorphic to the
Banach space of strongly affine real-valued functions on its state space.

terms of the energy barrier to inter-grain diffusion at grain boundaries, as
corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations. This leads to transitions from
uncorrelated growth to a crossover from random-to-correlated growth and
transient anomalous scaling as T increases. Due to these finite-time effects,
we were not able to determine the universality class of the system through the
critical exponents. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that this can be circumvented
by analyzing height, roughness and maximal height distributions, which allow us
to prove that CdTe grows asymptotically according to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang

  Multi-Class Customers","Accepted Transactions on Smart Grid",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to foster electric vehicle (EV) adoption, there is a strong need for
designing and developing charging stations that can accommodate different
customer classes, distinguished by their charging preferences, needs, and
technologies. By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes
more congested and, therefore, controlling of charging demands should be
carefully aligned with the available resources. This paper focuses on an EV
charging network equipped with different charging technologies and proposes two
frameworks. In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV
population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty
fleets. This which necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to
prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This
framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer
request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality
of service. The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for
smaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of
resources required to provide certain levels of quality of service to each
class. The results show that the proposed frameworks ensure grid reliability
and lead to significant savings in capacity planning.

contain objects. In order to determine a small set of proposals with a high
recall, a common scheme is extracting multiple features followed by a ranking
algorithm which however, incurs two major challenges: {\bf 1)} The ranking
model often imposes pairwise constraints between each proposal, rendering the
problem away from an efficient training/testing phase; {\bf 2)} Linear kernels
are utilized due to the computational and memory bottleneck of training a
kernelized model.
  In this paper, we remedy these two issues by suggesting a {\em kernelized
partial ranking model}. In particular, we demonstrate that {\bf i)} our partial
ranking model reduces the number of constraints from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nk)$ where
$n$ is the number of all potential proposals for an image but we are only
interested in top-$k$ of them that has the largest overlap with the ground
truth; {\bf ii)} we permit non-linear kernels in our model which is often
superior to the linear classifier in terms of accuracy. For the sake of
mitigating the computational and memory issues, we introduce a consistent
weighted sampling~(CWS) paradigm that approximates the non-linear kernel as
well as facilitates an efficient learning. In fact, as we will show, training a
linear CWS model amounts to learning a kernelized model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that equipped with the non-linear kernel and the partial ranking
algorithm, recall at top-$k$ proposals can be substantially improved.

wavelet transforms from B-spline scaling functions defined on a grid of

biorthogonal, compactly supported Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelets. The new
construction is based on the factorisation of wavelet transforms into lifting
steps. The second and third contributions are new insights on how to use these
and other wavelets in statistical applications. The second contribution is
related to the bias of a wavelet representation. It is investigated how the
fine scaling coefficients should be derived from the observations. In the
context of equispaced data, it is common practice to simply take the
observations as fine scale coefficients. It is argued in this paper that this
is not acceptable for non-interpolating wavelets on non-equidistant data.
Finally, the third contribution is the study of the variance in a
non-orthogonal wavelet transform in a new framework, replacing the numerical
condition as a measure for non-orthogonality. By controlling the variances of
the reconstruction from the wavelet coefficients, the new framework allows us
to design wavelet transforms on irregular point sets with a focus on their use
for smoothing or other applications in statistics.

present a formal hybrid dynamical system model that introduces suitably
restricted compositions of these familiar abstractions with the guarantee of
consistency analogous to global existence and uniqueness in classical dynamical
systems. The hybrid system developed here provides a discontinuous but
self-consistent approximation to the continuous (though possibly very stiff and
fast) dynamics of a physical robot undergoing intermittent impacts. The

in mitigating this challenge. This approach can collect Cloud infrastructure
information along with workflow provenance and can establish a mapping between

thus becoming increasingly hard to collect sufficient training data to learn
conventional models for each category. This issue may be ameliorated by the
increasingly popular 'zero-shot learning' (ZSL) paradigm. In this framework a
mapping is constructed between visual features and a human interpretable
semantic description of each category, allowing categories to be recognised in
the absence of any training data. Existing ZSL studies focus primarily on image
data, and attribute-based semantic representations. In this paper, we address
zero-shot recognition in contemporary video action recognition tasks, using
semantic word vector space as the common space to embed videos and category
labels. This is more challenging because the mapping between the semantic space
and space-time features of videos containing complex actions is more complex
and harder to learn. We demonstrate that a simple self-training and data
augmentation strategy can significantly improve the efficacy of this mapping.

to barrier controlled spin injection or the well known conductivity mismatch
case. The second regime at intermediate voltages corresponds to strongly
suppressed magnetoresistance. The third regime develops at higher voltages and
accounts for a novel paradigm. It is promoted by the strong non-linearity in
the charge transport which strength is characterized by the dimensionless
parameter $eU/k_BT$. This nonlinearity, depending on device conditions, can
lead to both significant enhancement or to exponential suppression of the spin
valve effect in organic devices. We believe that these predictions are valid
beyond the case of organic semiconductors and should be considered for any
material characterized by strongly non-linear charge transport.

large Rashba splitting which excludes a topological nature. We further
demonstrate that the other metallic surface state, located at $\bar{X}$, is not
an independent in-gap state as supposed previously, but part of a massive band

and 68% confidence intervals for the two possible mass hierarchies:
  Normal Hierarchy: $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.514^{+0.055}_{-0.056}$ and $\Delta
m^2_{32}=(2.51\pm0.10)\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$/c$^4$

m^2_{13}=(2.48\pm0.10)\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$/c$^4$
  The analysis accounts for multi-nucleon mechanisms in neutrino interactions
which were found to introduce negligible bias.
  We describe our first analyses that combine measurements of muon neutrino
disappearance and electron neutrino appearance to estimate four oscillation
parameters and the mass hierarchy. Frequentist and Bayesian intervals are
presented for combinations of these parameters, with and without including
recent reactor measurements. At 90% confidence level and including reactor
measurements, we exclude the region:
  $\delta_{CP}=[0.15,0.83]\pi$ for normal hierarchy and
$\delta_{CP}=[-0.08,1.09]\pi$ for inverted hierarchy.
  The T2K and reactor data weakly favor the normal hierarchy with a Bayes
Factor of 2.2. The most probable values and 68% 1D credible intervals for the
other oscillation parameters, when reactor data are included, are:
  $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.528^{+0.055}_{-0.038}$ and $|\Delta

the features of scaled Brownian motion and heterogeneous diffusion parent
processes. We compute the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements
of this generalised diffusion process. The scaling exponent of the ensemble
averaged mean squared displacement is shown to be the product of the critical
exponents of the parent processes, and describes both subdiffusive and
superdiffusive systems. We quantify the amplitude fluctuations of the time
averaged mean squared displacement as function of the length of the time series
and the lag time. In particular, we observe a weak ergodicity breaking of this
generalised diffusion process: even in the long time limit the ensemble and
time averaged mean squared displacements are strictly disparate. When we start
to observe this process some time after its initiation we observe distinct
features of ageing. We derive a universal ageing factor for the time averaged
mean squared displacement containing all information on the ageing time and the
measurement time. External confinement is shown to alter the magnitudes and
statistics of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements.

the fascinating world of neutron stars by relying on relativistic density
functional theory. Density functional theory provides a powerful--and perhaps
unique--framework for the calculation of both the properties of finite nuclei
and neutron stars. Given the enormous densities that may be reached in the core
of neutron stars, it is essential that such theoretical framework incorporates
from the outset the basic principles of Lorentz covariance and special
relativity. After a brief historical perspective, we present the necessary
details required to compute the equation of state of dense, neutron-rich
matter. As the equation of state is all that is needed to compute the structure
of neutron stars, we discuss how nuclear physics--particularly certain kind of
laboratory experiments--can provide significant constrains on the behavior of
neutron-rich matter.

verified on the basis of the transverse momentum distributions of bosons and
fermions created in the $pp$ collisions at high energies using the
Tsallis-factorized statistics and the two-component distributions of the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. The main differences between the parameters of the
Tsallis-factorized statistics and the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics were
identified. The results of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics are reasonable and
suggest that the soft and hard hadrons may be produced from the two different
macroscopic states of the dynamical system. It was revealed that the volume of
the system obtained in the Tsallis-factorized statistics is unusually large in
comparison with the geometrical volume of two protons. The main formulas for
the Tsallis statistics in the grand canonical ensemble were formulated.

Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14~May 2009 and scanned the
microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12~August 2009 and
23~October 2013. In February~2015, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released
the second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire Planck
mission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set of
scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This
paper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the data
products in the release, as well as the associated cosmological and
astrophysical science results and papers. The science products include maps of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect,
and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact
Galactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of
Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations
of signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods
and assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess
cosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB
lensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving
from CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as
constraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark
energy, and modified gravity.

window functions, and the associated uncertainties for the Planck Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI). The structure of the paper is similar to that presented in
the 2013 Planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalization
and the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.
The in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on measurements performed
during observations of Jupiter. By stacking data from seven Jupiter transits,
the main beam profiles are measured down to -25 dB at 30 and 44 GHz, and down
to -30 dB at 70 GHz. It has been confirmed that the agreement between the
simulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency
band (within the 20 dB contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and
70 GHz; 0.2% at 44 GHz). Simulated polarized beams are used for the computation
of the effective beam window functions. The error budget for the window
functions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, and
accounts for the radiometer band shapes. The total uncertainties in the
effective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively
(at $\ell \approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 GHz (at $\ell \approx 1000$).

Frequency Instrument) data. The mapmaking step takes as input the calibrated
timelines and pointing information. The main products are sky maps of $I,Q$,
and $U$ Stokes components. For the first time, we present polarization maps at
LFI frequencies. The mapmaking algorithm is based on a destriping technique,
enhanced with a noise prior. The Galactic region is masked to reduce errors
arising from bandpass mismatch and high signal gradients. We apply horn-uniform
radiometer weights to reduce effects of beam shape mismatch. The algorithm is
the same as used for the 2013 release, apart from small changes in parameter
settings. We validate the procedure through simulations. Special emphasis is
put on the control of systematics, which is particularly important for accurate
polarization analysis. We also produce low-resolution versions of the maps, and
corresponding noise covariance matrices. These serve as input in later analysis
steps and parameter estimation. The noise covariance matrices are validated
through noise Monte Carlo simulations. The residual noise in the map products
is characterized through analysis of half-ring maps, noise covariance matrices,
and simulations.

The full mission TOI is included in the Planck 2015 release. This paper
describes the HFI TOI and beam processing for the 2015 release. HFI calibration

modified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), by
including a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and by
improving the model of the bolometer time response. The beam processing is an
essential tool that derives the angular response used in all the Planck science
papers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window function
uncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. Noise
correlations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed using

Instrument (HFI) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometrically
calibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. The
data from the entire 2.5 year HFI mission include almost five independent
full-sky surveys. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from
100 to 857 GHz. To obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such a
large range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. The
545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmospheric
emission. The lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 GHz) are calibrated using the
time-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the
""orbital dipole"". This source of calibration only depends on the satellite
velocity with respect to the solar system. Using a CMB temperature of 2.7255
+/- 0.0006 K, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the CMB
solar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu K) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higher
than the WMAP measurement with a direction that is consistent between both
experiments. We describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity and
linear polarization from the HFI timelines, and the scheme used to set the zero
level of the maps a posteriori. We also summarize the noise characteristics of
the HFI maps in the 2015 Planck data release and present some null tests to
assess their quality. Finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and in
particular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors that
leads to spurious polarization signal.

857 GHz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 GHz in polarization.
In this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical component
separation, and process these maps within a Bayesian framework to derive a
consistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. For the temperature
analysis, we combine the Planck observations with the 9-year WMAP sky maps and
the Haslam et al. 408 MHz map to derive a joint model of CMB, synchrotron,
free-free, spinning dust, CO, line emission in the 94 and 100 GHz channels, and
thermal dust emission. Full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutions
varying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,
relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky
model, and best-fit values are tabulated. For polarization, the model includes
CMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. These models provide excellent
fits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK
over 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional
errors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. The main limitations of
the temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among the
spinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observations
from external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. The
main limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies are
uncertainties in the 545 and 857 GHz calibration and zero-points. For
polarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the
100-353 GHz bands on large angular scales in the form of
temperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digital
conversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expected
to improve in the near future.

and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the
six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and
lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9)
km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar
spectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured
parameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck
temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a
reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with
other astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective
number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is
constrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005.
For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent
with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck
(BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We
find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation
of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big
bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent
agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and
deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics.
The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the
JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher
than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart
from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description
of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.

Minor changes after journal acceptance",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201525814",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and
modified gravity (MG), beyond the cosmological constant scenario. We start with
cases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering
Taylor expansions of the equation of state, principal component analysis and
parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar
field. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly
improve present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the
DE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the
phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range
of specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In
addition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic
acoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble
constant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological
perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational
lensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and
for breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck
and background data sets. All results that include only background
parameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also
change perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions
appear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is \sim 2 sigma for Planck
TT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials
with a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when
external data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB
lensing.

background (CMB) lensing potential to date (at a level of 40 sigma), using
temperature and polarization data from the Planck 2015 full-mission release.
Using a polarization-only estimator we detect lensing at a significance of 5
sigma. We cross-check the accuracy of our measurement using the wide frequency
coverage and complementarity of the temperature and polarization measurements.
Public products based on this measurement include an estimate of the lensing
potential over approximately 70% of the sky, an estimate of the lensing
potential power spectrum in bandpowers for the multipole range 40<L<400 and an
associated likelihood for cosmological parameter constraints. We find good
agreement between our measurement of the lensing potential power spectrum and
that found in the best-fitting LCDM model based on the Planck temperature and
polarization power spectra. Using the lensing likelihood alone we obtain a
percent-level measurement of the parameter combination $\sigma_8
\Omega_m^{0.25} = 0.591\pm 0.021$. We combine our determination of the lensing
potential with the E-mode polarization also measured by Planck to generate an
estimate of the lensing B-mode. We show that this lensing B-mode estimate is
correlated with the B-modes observed directly by Planck at the expected level
and with a statistical significance of 10 sigma, confirming Planck's
sensitivity to this known sky signal. We also correlate our lensing potential
estimate with the large-scale temperature anisotropies, detecting a
cross-correlation at the 3 sigma level, as expected due to dark energy in the
concordance LCDM model.

E-mode polarization maps are analysed to obtain constraints on primordial
non-Gaussianity(NG). Using three classes of optimal bispectrum estimators -
separable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and modal - we obtain consistent
values for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes,
quoting as our final result from temperature alone fNL^local=2.5+\-5.7,
fNL^equil=-16+\-70 and fNL^ortho=-34+\-33(68%CL). Combining temperature and
polarization data we obtain fNL^local=0.8+\-5.0, fNL^equil=-4+\-43 and
fNL^ortho=-26+\-21 (68%CL). The results are based on cross-validation of these
estimators on simulations, are stable across component separation techniques,
pass an extensive suite of tests, and are consistent with Minkowski functionals
based measurements. The effect of time-domain de-glitching systematics on the
bispectrum is negligible. In spite of these test outcomes we conservatively
label the results including polarization data as preliminary, owing to a known
mismatch of the noise model in simulations and the data. Beyond fNL estimates,
we present model-independent reconstructions of the CMB bispectrum and derive
constraints on early universe scenarios that generate NG, including general
single-field and axion inflation, initial state modifications, parity-violating
tensor bispectra, and directionally dependent vector models. We also present a
wide survey of scale-dependent oscillatory bispectra, and we look for
isocurvature NG. Our constraint on the local primordial trispectrum amplitude
is gNL^local=(-9.0+\-7.7)x10^4 (68%CL), and we perform an analysis of
additional trispectrum shapes. The global picture is one of consistency with
the premises of the LambdaCDM cosmology, namely that the structure we observe
today was sourced by adiabatic, passive, Gaussian, and primordial seed
perturbations.[abridged]

from global isotropy on the largest scales. We present the first searches using
CMB polarization for correlations induced by a non-trivial topology with a
fundamental domain intersecting, or nearly intersecting, the last scattering
surface (at comoving distance $\chi_{rec}$). We specialize to flat spaces with
toroidal and slab topologies, finding that explicit searches for the latter are
sensitive to other topologies with antipodal symmetry. These searches yield no
detection of a compact topology at a scale below the diameter of the last
scattering surface. The limits on the radius $R_i$ of the largest sphere
inscribed in the topological domain (at log-likelihood-ratio $\Delta\ln{L}>-5$
relative to a simply-connected flat Planck best-fit model) are
$R_i>0.97\chi_{rec}$ for the cubic torus and $R_i>0.56\chi_{rec}$ for the slab.
The limit for the cubic torus from the matched-circles search is numerically
equivalent, $R_i>0.97\chi_{rec}$ (99% CL) from polarisation data alone. We also
perform a Bayesian search for a Bianchi VII$_h$ geometry. In the non-physical
setting where the Bianchi cosmology is decoupled from the standard cosmology,
Planck temperature data favour the inclusion of a Bianchi component. However,
the cosmological parameters generating this pattern are in strong disagreement
with those found from CMB anisotropy data alone. Fitting the induced
polarization pattern for this model to Planck data requires an amplitude of
$-0.1\pm0.04$ compared to +1 if the model were to be correct. In the physical
setting where the Bianchi parameters are fit simultaneously with the standard
cosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a Bianchi VII$_h$ cosmology
and constrain the vorticity of such models to $(\omega/H)_0<7.6\times10^{-10}$
(95% CL). [Abridged]

Revised following referee report",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201525821",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We compute and investigate four types of imprint of a stochastic background
of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies: the impact of PMFs on the CMB spectra; the effect on CMB
polarization induced by Faraday rotation; the impact of PMFs on the ionization
history; magnetically-induced non-Gaussianities; and the magnetically-induced
breaking of statistical isotropy. Overall, Planck data constrain the amplitude
of PMFs to less than a few nanogauss. In particular, individual limits coming
from the analysis of the CMB angular power spectra, using the Planck
likelihood, are $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.4$ nG (where $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}$ is
the comoving field amplitude at a scale of 1 Mpc) at 95% confidence level,
assuming zero helicity, and $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}< 5.6$ nG for a maximally
helical field.For nearly scale-invariant PMFs we obtain
$B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}<2.0$ nG and $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}<0.9$ nG if the impact of
PMFs on the ionization history of the Universe is included. From the analysis
of magnetically-induced non-Gaussianity we obtain three different values,
corresponding to three applied methods, all below 5 nG. The constraint from the
magnetically-induced passive-tensor bispectrum is $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}< 2.8$
nG. A search for preferred directions in the magnetically-induced passive
bispectrum yields $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.5$ nG, whereas the the
compensated-scalar bispectrum gives $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}< 3$ nG. The analysis
of the Faraday rotation of CMB polarization by PMFs uses the Planck power
spectra in $EE$ and $BB$ at 70 GHz and gives $B_{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}< 1380$ nG. In
our final analysis, we consider the harmonic-space correlations produced by
Alfv\'en waves, finding no significant evidence for the presence of these
waves. Together, these results comprise a comprehensive set of constraints on
possible PMFs with Planck data.

temperature and polarization data release. The CMB is cross-correlated with
different LSS tracers: the NVSS, SDSS and WISE catalogues, and the Planck 2015
lensing map. This cross-correlation yields a detection at $4\,\sigma$, where
most of the signal-to-noise is due to the Planck lensing and NVSS. In fact, the
ISW effect is detected only from the Planck data (through the ISW-lensing
bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to the detection level
achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming from all the
catalogues. The ISW signal allow us to detect $\Omega_\Lambda$ at more than
$3\,\sigma$. This cross-correlation analysis is performed only with the Planck
temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015 release
do not permit significant improvement of the CMB-LSS cross-correlation
detectability. Nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalously
large ISW signal previously reported through the stacking of CMB features at
the locations of known superstructures. We find that the current Planck
polarization data do not exclude that this signal could be caused by the ISW
effect. In addition, the stacking of the Planck lensing map on the locations of
superstructures exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scale
structures. Finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the ISW
temperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all the
previously mentioned LSS tracers. In particular, we construct a map of the ISW
secondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained from
simulations. We also explore the reconstruction of the ISW anisotropies caused
by the LSS traced by the 2MPZ survey by directly inverting the density field
into the gravitational potential field.

Planck full mission data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected
via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6,
and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology
sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible
constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the
larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in
redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of
gravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide
priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $(1-b)$. In addition, we use lensing
of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck
clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various
calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter
fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the Planck analysis
of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of $(1-b)$
the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it
remains substantial ($3.7\,\sigma$) for the largest estimated value. We also
examine constraints on extensions to the base flat $\Lambda$CDM model by
combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour
non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the
overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the
Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current
astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations
from the current 10%-level to 1% would significantly strengthen these combined
analyses and provide a stringent test of the base $\Lambda$CDM model.

detected from the 29 month full-mission data. The catalogue (PSZ2) is the
largest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest
all-sky catalogue of galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which
1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data-sets,
and is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing > $10^3$ confirmed
clusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in
terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of
83% on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the Y5R500 estimates are
robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate
conversion to Y500 requires. the use of prior information on the cluster
extent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary
data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical and X-ray
data-sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart
match. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a
population of low-redshift X-ray under- luminous clusters revealed by SZ
selection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent
properties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected
samples.

  Clumps",,,"10.1051/0004-6361/201525819",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the Planck Catalogue of Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCC), an all-sky
catalogue of Galactic cold clump candidates detected by Planck. This catalogue
is the full version of the Early Cold Core (ECC) catalogue, which was made
available in 2011 with the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC) and
contained 915 high S/N sources. It is based on the Planck 48 months mission
data that are currently being released to the astronomical community. The PGCC
catalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of Galactic cold
sources. The three highest Planck bands (857, 545, 353 GHz) have been combined
with IRAS data at 3 THz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sources
colder than their local environment. After rejection of possible extragalactic
contaminants, the PGCC catalogue contains 13188 Galactic sources spread across
the whole sky, i.e., from the Galactic plane to high latitudes, following the
spatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. The median
temperature of PGCC sources lies between 13 and 14.5 K, depending on the
quality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8
to 20 K after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. Using
seven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for
5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as their
mass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. The PGCC sources are located
mainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards the
Galactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.
Because of this diversity and because the PGCC catalogue contains sources in
very different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate the
evolution from molecular clouds to cores. Finally, the catalogue also includes
54 additional sources located in the SMC and LMC.

infrastructure to economics, and the study of their cascading behaviors using
percolation theory has attracted much attention in the recent years. To analyze
the percolation phenomena of these systems, different mathematical frameworks
have been proposed including generating functions, eigenvalues among some
others. These different frameworks approach the phase transition behaviors from
different angles, and have been very successful in shaping the different
quantities of interest including critical threshold, size of the giant
component, order of phase transition and the dynamics of cascading. These
methods also vary in their mathematical complexity in dealing with
interdependent networks that have additional complexity in terms of the
correlation among different layers of networks or links. In this work, we
review a particular approach of simple self-consistent probability equations,
and illustrate that it can greatly simplify the mathematical analysis for
systems ranging from single layer network to various different interdependent
networks. We give an overview on the detailed framework to study the nature of
the critical phase transition, value of the critical threshold and size of the
giant component for these different systems.

in turn leads to an underestimation of the size of information cascades. In
this work we study the effect of hidden network structure on information
diffusion processes. We characterise information cascades through activation
paths traversing visible and hidden parts of the network. We quantify diffusion
estimation error while varying the amount of hidden structure in five empirical

for the efficiency of the Skyrme interaction in describing surface properties.
Based on the nuclear equation of state, the curvature correction term to the
surface tension coefficient is calculated for 97 standard Skyrme interaction
parameter sets in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density at zero
temperature. The main idea is to find those parametrizations that give the
Tolman's $\delta$ correction close to the available theoretical predictions
from the statistical theory. Only 59 out of 97 models give satisfactory
results. Comparison of the obtained results with the results of the
implementation of different macroscopic and microscopic constraints to Skyrme
parametrizations available in the literature allows us to select 4 models that
satisfy all the constraints.

have turned out to be efficient for the time-integration of certain ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). This holds in particular for linear homogeneous
ODEs, where the exponential integrator is equivalent to approximating the
product of the matrix exponential and a vector. In this paper, we consider
linear inhomogeneous ODEs, $y'(t)=Ay(t)+g(t)$, where the function $g(t)$ is
assumed to satisfy certain regularity conditions. We derive an algorithm for
this problem which is equivalent to approximating the product of the matrix
exponential and a vector using Arnoldi's method. The construction is based on
expressing the function $g(t)$ as a linear combination of given basis functions
$[\phi_i]_{i=0}^\infty$ with particular properties. The properties are such
that the inhomogeneous ODE can be restated as an infinite-dimensional linear
homogeneous ODE. Moreover, the linear homogeneous infinite-dimensional ODE has
properties that directly allow us to extend a Krylov method for
finite-dimensional linear ODEs. Although the construction is based on an
infinite-dimensional operator, the algorithm can be carried out with operations
involving matrices and vectors of finite size. This type of construction
resembles in many ways the infinite Arnoldi method for nonlinear eigenvalue
problems. We prove convergence of the algorithm under certain natural
conditions, and illustrate properties of the algorithm with examples stemming
from the discretization of partial differential equations.

  graphene",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The commensurability condition is applied to determine the hierarchy of
fractional fillings of Landau levels in monolayer and bilayer graphene. The
filling rates for FQHE in graphene are found and illustrated in the first three
Landau levels. The good agreement with the experimental data is achieved. The
presence of even denominator filling fractions in the hierarchy for FQHE in
bilayer graphene is explained.

neutrosophic entropy. The first is an extension of Kaufmann's formula and the
second is an extension of Kosko's formula.
  Based on the primary three-valued information represented by the degree of
truth, degree of falsity and degree of neutrality there are built some
penta-valued representations that better highlights some specific features of
neutrosophic entropy. Thus, we highlight five features of neutrosophic
uncertainty such as ambiguity, ignorance, contradiction, neutrality and
saturation. These five features are supplemented until a seven partition of
unity by adding two features of neutrosophic certainty such as truth and
falsity.
  The paper also presents the particular forms of neutrosophic entropy obtained
in the case of bifuzzy representations, intuitionistic fuzzy representations,
paraconsistent fuzzy representations and finally the case of fuzzy
representations.
