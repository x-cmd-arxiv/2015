Ulmer. In contrast to the generic case we show that the race exhibits very

constrain the limits of the present Orthodox Line of Research (OLR), but also
how these desiderata implicitly preclude the possibility of developing a
physical representation of quantum superpositions. We will then continue
analyzing how most interpretations of QM argue against the existence of
superpositions. Firstly, we will focus on those interpretations which attempt
to recover a classical representation about ""what there is"", and secondly, we
will concentrate on the arguments provided by Dieks and Griffiths who, staying
close to the orthodox formalism, also attempt to ""get rid of the ghost of
Schrodinger's cat"". Contrary to the OLR, we will argue -based on our definition
of Meaningful Physical Statements (MPS)- that from a representational realist
perspective which stays close to the orthodox Hilbert space formalism, quantum
superpositions are not only the key to the most important -present and future-
technological and experimental developments in quantum information processing
but also, they must be considered as the kernel of any interpretation of QM
that attempts to provide a physical representation of reality. We will also

  Constraints",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unknown constraints arise in many types of expensive black-box optimization
problems. Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian
optimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI)
heuristic. However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For
example, in the case of decoupled constraints---i.e., when one can
independently evaluate the objective or the constraints---EI can encounter a
pathology that prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a
current best solution, which may not exist if none of the data collected so far
satisfy the constraints. By contrast, information-based approaches do not
suffer from these failure modes. In this paper, we present a new
information-based method called Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints
(PESC). We analyze the performance of PESC and show that it compares favorably
to EI-based approaches on synthetic and benchmark problems, as well as several
real-world examples. We demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that
provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained
Bayesian optimization.

principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have

Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward
propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward

show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering
competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides
accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights.

provides a new platform to host rich and novel classes of quantum commensurate
and in-commensurate phases, excitations and phase transitions. These
commensurate phases include two collinear states at low and high Zeeman field,
two co-planar canted states at Mirror reflected SOC parameters respectively.
Most importantly, there are non-coplanar incommensurate Skyrmion (IC-SkX)
crystal phases surrounded by the 4 commensurate phases. New excitation spectra
above all the 5 phases, especially on the IC-SKX phase are computed. Three
different classes of quantum commensurate to in-commensurate transitions from
the IC-SKX to its 4 neighboring commensurate phases are identified. Finite
temperature behaviors and transitions are discussed. The critical temperatures
of all the phases can be raised above that reachable by current cold atom
cooling techniques simply by tuning the number of atoms $ N $ per site. In view
of recent impressive experimental advances in generating 2d SOC for cold atoms
in optical lattices, these new many-body phenomena can be explored in the
current and near future cold atom experiments. Applications to various

four brushless DC motors. We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied
modes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion
tasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping,
and more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated
body, requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our
interest in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a
relatively few base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of
available choices. Here we report on the development of one important example
of such a behavioral programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal
sagittal plane hopping gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF
base controllers.
  For this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is
fastened to a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform's
locomotion is powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in
flight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape
in flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance.
The motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four
simple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in
isolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these
abstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific
component of the locomotion task at hand. We present a partial proof of
correctness for this parallel composition of template reference systems along
with data from the physical platform suggesting these templates are anchored as
evidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic motions with a suitably
transformed image of traces from the physical platform.

boundaries of the habitable zone caused by the increasing luminosity of the
Sun. Predictions about the future of habitable conditions on Earth include a
decline in species diversity and habitat extent, ocean loss and changes in the
magnitudes of geochemical cycles. However, testing these predictions on the
present-day Earth is difficult. The discovery of a planet that is a near
analogue to the far future Earth could provide a means to test these
predictions. Such a planet would need to have an Earth-like biosphere history,
requiring it to have been in its system's habitable zone (HZ) for Gyr-long
periods during the system's past, and to be approaching the inner-edge of the
HZ at present. Here we assess the possibility of finding this very specific
type of exoplanet and discuss the benefits of analysing older Earths in terms
of improving our understanding of long-term geological and bio-geological
processes. As an illustrative example, G stars within 10 parsecs are assessed
as potential old-Earth-analogue hosts. Surface temperature estimates for
hypothetical inner-HZ Earth analogues are used to determine whether any such
planets in these systems would be at the right stage in their late-habitable
lifetimes to exhibit detectable biosignatures. Predictions from planet
formation studies and biosphere evolution models suggest that only 0.36% of G
stars in the solar neighbourhood could host an old-Earth-analogue. However, if
the development of an Earth-like biosphere is assumed to be rare, requiring a
sequence of low-probability events to occur, then such planets are unlikely to
be found in the solar neighbourhood - although 1000s could be present in the

primordial B-mode polarization, robust methods for delensing the CMB
polarization sky are becoming increasingly important. We investigate in detail
the possibility of delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background (CIB),
emission from dusty star-forming galaxies that is an excellent tracer of the
CMB lensing signal, in order to improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r$. We find that the maps of the CIB, such as current Planck satellite
maps at 545 GHz, can be used to remove more than half of the lensing B-mode
power. Calculating optimal combinations of different large-scale-structure
tracers for delensing, we find that co-adding CIB data and external
arcminute-resolution CMB lensing reconstruction can lead to significant
additional improvements in delensing performance. We investigate whether
measurement uncertainty in the CIB spectra will degrade the delensing
performance if no model of the CIB spectra is assumed, and instead the CIB
spectra are marginalized over, when constraining $r$. We find that such
uncertainty does not significantly affect B-mode surveys smaller than a few
thousand degrees. Even for larger surveys it causes only a moderate reduction
in CIB delensing performance, especially if the surveys have high (arcminute)
resolution, which allows self-calibration of the delensing procedure. Though
further work on the impact of foreground residuals is required, our overall
conclusions for delensing with current CIB data are optimistic: this delensing
method can tighten constraints on $r$ by a factor up to $\approx2.2$, and by a
factor up to $\approx4$ when combined with external $\approx 3 \mu$K-arcmin
lensing reconstruction, without requiring the modeling of CIB properties. CIB
delensing is thus a promising method for the upcoming generation of CMB
polarization surveys.

algebraic K-theory with coefficients is A1-homotopy invariant. In this article
we generalize this result from schemes to the broad setting of dg categories.
Along the way, we extend Bass-Quillen's fundamental theorem as well as
Stienstra's foundational work on module structures over the big Witt ring to
the setting of dg categories. Among other cases, the above A1-homotopy
invariance result can now be applied to sheaves of (not necessarily
commutative) dg algebras over stacks. As an application, we compute the
algebraic K-theory with coefficients of dg cluster categories using solely the
kernel and cokernel of the Coxeter matrix. This leads to a complete computation
of the algebraic K-theory with coefficients of the Kleinian singularities
parametrized by the simply laced Dynkin diagrams. As a byproduct, we obtain
some vanishing and divisibility properties of algebraic K-theory (without
coefficients).

classification noise of rate $\eta \in (0,1/2)$. A polynomial time algorithm
for this problem (when $\eta > 0$ and $k = \omega(1)$) is a longstanding
challenge in learning theory. Grigorescu et al. showed an algorithm running in

requires time ${n \choose k/2}$ even when the noise rate $\eta$ is polynomially
small. We observe that for sufficiently small noise rate, it is possible to
break the $n \choose k/2$ barrier. In particular, if for some function $f(n) =

properties - the rutile and anatase polymorphs of TiO2 are a prime example.
Polytypism is a special type of polymorphism, occurring in layered materials
when the geometry of a repeating structural layer is maintained but the layer
stacking sequence of the overall crystal structure can be varied; SiC is an
example of a material with many polytypes. Although polymorphs can have
radically different physical properties, it is much rarer for polytypism to
impact physical properties in a dramatic fashion. Here we study the effects of
polytypism and polymorphism on the superconductivity of TaSe2, one of the
archetypal members of the large family of layered dichalcogenides. We show that
it is possible to access 2 stable polytypes and 2 stable polymorphs in the
TaSe2-xTex solid solution, and find that the 3R polytype shows a
superconducting transition temperature that is nearly 17 times higher than that
of the much more commonly found 2H polytype. The reason for this dramatic
change is not apparent, but we propose that it arises either from a remarkable
dependence of Tc on subtle differences in the characteristics of the single
layers present, or from a surprising effect of the layer stacking sequence on
electronic properties that instead are expected to be dominated by the
properties of a single layer in materials of this kind.

values are decomposed into the boundary-free AdS and brane-induced

This behavior is in contrast to that for a plane boundary in Minkowski

The Lyalpha line is reliably detected at 6.1 sigma and shows an asymmetric

inter-galactic medium near the Planck peak of cosmic reionization. The line has
a rest-frame equivalent width of EW0=21+-4 A and is extended with

Lyman break galaxy in the full CANDELS and BoRG/HIPPIES surveys, having

The redshift confirms that the IRAC [4.5] photometry is very likely dominated
by line emission with EW0(OIII+Hbeta)= 720-150+180 A. This detection thus adds
to the evidence that extreme rest-frame optical emission lines are a ubiquitous

polarization (DNP) occurs in central spin systems when electronic angular
momentum is transferred to nuclear spins and is exploited in spin-based quantum
information processing for coherent electron and nuclear spin control. However,
the mechanisms limiting DNP remain only partially understood. Here, we show
that spin-orbit coupling quenches DNP in a GaAs double quantum dot, even though
spin-orbit coupling in GaAs is weak. Using Landau-Zener sweeps, we measure the
dependence of the electron spin-flip probability on the strength and direction
of in-plane magnetic field, allowing us to distinguish effects of the
spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. To confirm our interpretation, we
measure high-bandwidth correlations in the electron spin-flip probability and
attain results consistent with a significant spin-orbit contribution. We
observe that DNP is quenched when the spin-orbit component exceeds the
hyperfine, in agreement with a theoretical model. Our results shed new light on
the surprising competition between the spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions in
central-spin systems.

ejecta is much more anisotropic than that from binary neutron star mergers. In
particular, the dynamical ejecta is concentrated around the orbital plane with
a half opening angle of 10--20deg and often sweeps out only a half of the
plane. The ejecta mass can be as large as ~0.1M_sun, and the velocity is
subrelativistic with ~0.2--0.3c for typical cases. The ratio of the ejecta mass
to the bound mass (disk and fallback components) is larger, and the ejecta
velocity is larger, for larger values of the binary mass ratio, i.e., for
larger values of the black-hole mass. The remnant black hole-disk system

this easily dominates the kick velocity due to gravitational radiation.

when the filling fraction $\nu < 1/2$ and to the hole density when $\nu > 1/2$.
We introduce a local field theory for the CFL and Anti-CFL in the presence of a

interface between the Anti-CFL and CFL. We show that the CFL - Anti-CFL
interface allows partially fused boundary phases in which ""composite electrons""

transmutation between topologically distinct quasiparticles. We discuss several
observable consequences of the Anti-CFL, including a predicted resistivity jump
at a first order transition between uniform CFL and Anti-CFL phases. We also
present a theory of a continuous quantum phase transition between the CFL and

perturbations is sensitive to the pressure-less matter dominated era before

related problems. These include: a greatly-enhanced version of the slug code
introduced by da Silva et al. (2012), which computes spectra and photometry for
stochastically- or deterministically-sampled stellar populations with
nearly-arbitrary star formation histories, clustering properties, and initial
mass functions; cloudy_slug, a tool that automatically couples slug-computed
spectra with the cloudy radiative transfer code in order to predict stochastic
nebular emission; bayesphot, a general-purpose tool for performing Bayesian
inference on the physical properties of stellar systems based on unresolved
photometry; and cluster_slug and sfr_slug, a pair of tools that use bayesphot
on a library of slug models to compute the mass, age, and extinction of
mono-age star clusters, and the star formation rate of galaxies, respectively.
The latter two tools make use of an extensive library of pre-computed stellar
population models, which are included the software. The complete package is
available at http://www.slugsps.com.

that utilizes calorimeter jets that (i) are composed dominantly of displaced

jet signatures are smoking guns for models with a composite dark sector where a
parton shower in the dark sector is followed by displaced decays of dark pions
back to SM jets. No current LHC searches are sensitive to this type of
phenomenology. We perform a detailed simulation for a benchmark signal with two
regular and two emerging jets, and present and implement strategies to suppress
QCD backgrounds by up to six orders of magnitude. At the 14 TeV LHC, this
signature can be probed with mediator masses as large as 1.5 TeV for a range of
dark pion lifetimes, and the reach is increased further at the high-luminosity
LHC. The emerging jet search is also sensitive to a broad class of long-lived
phenomena, and we show this for a supersymmetric model with R-parity violation.
Possibilities for discovery at LHCb are also discussed.

misaligned with respect to the binary orbit. The gravitational torque from a
companion induces nodal precession in misaligned disc orbits. We calculate
whether this precession is strong enough to overcome the internal disc torques
communicating angular momentum. For typical parameters precession wins: the
disc breaks into distinct planes that precess effectively independently. We run
hydrodynamical simulations to check these results, and confirm that disc
breaking is widespread and generally enhances accretion on to the central

estimate the number of components in a finite mixture model via a Zmix
algorithm. Zmix provides a bridge between multidimensional samplers and test
based estimation methods, whereby priors are chosen to encourage extra groups
to have weights approaching zero. MCMC sampling is made possible by the
implementation of prior parallel tempering, an extension of parallel tempering.
Zmix can accurately estimate the number of components, posterior parameter
estimates and allocation probabilities given a sufficiently large sample size.
The results will reflect uncertainty in the final model and will report the
range of possible candidate models and their respective estimated probabilities

light-weight method, Zswitch, developed for overfitted mixtures by exploiting
the intuitiveness of allocation-based relabelling algorithms and the precision
of label-invariant loss functions. Four simulation studies are included to
illustrate Zmix and Zswitch, as well as three case studies from the literature.

multiuser Gaussian channels. Particularly, we consider two problems: the first
is to send correlated Gaussian sources on a Gaussian broadcast channel where
each receiver is interested in reconstructing only one source component (or one
specific linear function of the sources) under the mean squared error
distortion measure; the second is to send correlated Gaussian sources on a
Gaussian multiple-access channel, where each transmitter observes a noisy
combination of the source, and the receiver wishes to reconstruct the
individual source components (or individual linear functions) under the mean
squared error distortion measure. It is shown that when the channel parameters
match certain general conditions, the induced distortion tuples are on the
boundary of the achievable distortion region, and thus optimal. Instead of
following the conventional approach of attempting to characterize the
achievable distortion region, we ask the question whether and how a match can
be effectively determined. This decision problem formulation helps to
circumvent the difficult optimization problem often embedded in region
characterization problems, and it also leads us to focus on the critical
conditions in the outer bounds that make the inequalities become equalities,
which effectively decouple the overall problem into several simpler
sub-problems. Optimality results previously unknown in the literature are
obtained using this novel approach. As a byproduct of the investigation, novel
outer bounds are derived for these two problems.

confinement. The resulting dewetting transitions are often impeded by large
kinetic barriers. According to macroscopic theory, such barriers arise from the
free energy required to nucleate a critical vapor tube that spans the region
between two hydrophobic surfaces - tubes with smaller radii collapse, whereas
larger ones grow to dry the entire confined region. Using extensive molecular
simulations of water between two nanoscopic hydrophobic surfaces, in
conjunction with advanced sampling techniques, here we show that for
inter-surface separations that thermodynamically favor dewetting, the barrier
to dewetting does not correspond to the formation of a (classical) critical
vapor tube. Instead, it corresponds to an abrupt transition from an isolated
cavity adjacent to one of the confining surfaces to a gap-spanning vapor tube
that is already larger than the critical vapor tube anticipated by macroscopic
theory. Correspondingly, the barrier to dewetting is also smaller than the
classical expectation. We show that the peculiar nature of water density
fluctuations adjacent to extended hydrophobic surfaces - namely, the enhanced
likelihood of observing low-density fluctuations relative to Gaussian
statistics - facilitates this non-classical behavior. By stabilizing isolated
cavities relative to vapor tubes, enhanced water density fluctuations thus
stabilize novel pathways, which circumvent the classical barriers and offer
diminished resistance to dewetting. Our results thus suggest a key role for
fluctuations in speeding up the kinetics of numerous phenomena ranging from
Cassie-Wenzel transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces, to
hydrophobically-driven biomolecular folding and assembly.

dependence of the radial scalelength of synchrotron emission indicates
energy-dependent propagation of the cosmic-ray electrons, probably via the
streaming instability. The equipartition strength of the total magnetic field
is typically 15 muG, that of the ordered field 5 muG. Faraday rotation of the
polarization angles reveals an underlying regular field of only about 0.5 muG
strength with a large-scale axisymmetric spiral pattern, signature of a
mean-field dynamo, and an about 10x stronger field that fluctuates on scales of
a few 100 pc. The magnetic field around the bar in the central region of IC 342
resembles that of large barred galaxies; its regular spiral field is directed
outwards, opposite to that in the disk. The polarized emission in the disk is
concentrated in: (1) a narrow arm of about 300 pc width, displaced inwards with
respect to the eastern arm by about 200 pc, indicating magnetic fields
compressed by a density wave; (2) a broad arm of 300-500 pc width around the
northern arm with systematic variations in polarized emission, polarization
angles, and Faraday rotation measures on a scale of about 2 kpc, indicative of
a helically twisted flux tube generated by the Parker instability; (3) a
rudimentary ""magnetic arm"" in an interarm region in the north-west; (4) several
broad spiral arms in the outer galaxy, related to spiral arms in the total
neutral gas; (5) short features in the outer south-western galaxy, probably
distorted by tidal interaction. - The generation and development of ""magnetic
arms"" by a mean-field dynamo probably need a spiral pattern that is stable over
a few galactic rotation periods. The dynamo in IC 342 is slow and weak,
probably disturbed by the bar, tidal interaction, or a transient spiral
pattern.

under uncertainty that scale to tens or even hundreds of agents. However, most
of these methods either make restrictive assumptions on the problem domain, or
provide approximate solutions without any guarantees on quality. Methods in the
former category typically build on heuristic search using upper bounds on the
value function. Unfortunately, no techniques exist to compute such upper bounds
for problems with non-factored value functions. To allow for meaningful
benchmarking through measurable quality guarantees on a very general class of
problems, this paper introduces a family of influence-optimistic upper bounds
for factored decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes
(Dec-POMDPs) that do not have factored value functions. Intuitively, we derive
bounds on very large multiagent planning problems by subdividing them in
sub-problems, and at each of these sub-problems making optimistic assumptions
with respect to the influence that will be exerted by the rest of the system.
We numerically compare the different upper bounds and demonstrate how we can
achieve a non-trivial guarantee that a heuristic solution for problems with
hundreds of agents is close to optimal. Furthermore, we provide evidence that
the upper bounds may improve the effectiveness of heuristic influence search,
and discuss further potential applications to multiagent planning.

$n$-vertex graph $G$ can be mapped to the vertices of a given $h$-vertex graph
$H$ such that each edge of $G$ is mapped to an edge of $H$. The problem
generalizes the graph coloring problem and at the same time can be viewed as a
special case of the $2$-CSP problem. In this paper, we prove several lower
bound for HOM under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) assumption. The main
result is a lower bound $2^{\Omega\left( \frac{n \log h}{\log \log h}\right)}$.
This rules out the existence of a single-exponential algorithm and shows that
the trivial upper bound $2^{{\mathcal O}(n\log{h})}$ is almost asymptotically
tight.
  We also investigate what properties of graphs $G$ and $H$ make it difficult
to solve HOM$(G,H)$. An easy observation is that an ${\mathcal O}(h^n)$ upper
bound can be improved to ${\mathcal O}(h^{\operatorname{vc}(G)})$ where
$\operatorname{vc}(G)$ is the minimum size of a vertex cover of $G$. The second
lower bound $h^{\Omega(\operatorname{vc}(G))}$ shows that the upper bound is
asymptotically tight. As to the properties of the ""right-hand side"" graph $H$,
it is known that HOM$(G,H)$ can be solved in time $(f(\Delta(H)))^n$ and
$(f(\operatorname{tw}(H)))^n$ where $\Delta(H)$ is the maximum degree of $H$
and $\operatorname{tw}(H)$ is the treewidth of $H$. This gives
single-exponential algorithms for graphs of bounded maximum degree or bounded
treewidth. Since the chromatic number $\chi(H)$ does not exceed
$\operatorname{tw}(H)$ and $\Delta(H)+1$, it is natural to ask whether similar
upper bounds with respect to $\chi(H)$ can be obtained. We provide a negative
answer to this question by establishing a lower bound $(f(\chi(H)))^n$ for any
function $f$. We also observe that similar lower bounds can be obtained for
locally injective homomorphisms.

that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most,
except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared
down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and
larger spacings. So while the high multiple systems (five or more transiting
planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double
planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the
descendants of more closely packed high multiple systems. If this hypothesis is
correct, we infer that the formation environment of Kepler systems should be
different from that of the terrestrial planets.

Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition without gauge fixing, we obtain two
Schr\""{o}dinger-like equations for two types of KK modes of the bulk $q-$form
field, which determine the localization and mass spectra of these KK modes. It
is found that there are two types of zero modes (the $0-$level modes): a
$q-$form zero mode and a $(q-1)-$form one, which cannot be localized on the
brane at the same time. For the $n-$level KK modes, there are two interacting
KK modes, a massive $q-$form KK mode and a massless $(q-1)-$form one. By
analyzing gauge invariance of the effective action and choosing a gauge
condition, the $n-$level massive $q-$form KK mode decouples from the $n-$level
massless $(q-1)-$form one. It is also found that the Hodge duality in the bulk
naturally becomes two dualities on the brane. The first one is the Hodge
duality between a $q-$form zero mode and a $(p-q-1)-$form one, or between a
$(q-1)-$form zero mode and a $(p-q)-$form one. The second duality is between
two group KK modes: one is an $n-$level massive $q-$form KK mode with mass
$m_n$ and an $n-$level massless $(q-1)-$form mode; another is an $n-$level
$(p-q)-$form one with the same mass $m_n$ and an $n-$level massless

the brane for the KK modes of the two dual bulk form fields are physically
equivalent.

setting of a multiple testing technique introduced by Fromont and Laurent

of the $L^2$--distance $d_2(f,f_0) = \int {[f(x) - f_0 (x)]^2 d\,G_X (x)}$,
rejecting the null hypothesis when at least one of them is greater than its

introduced by Picard and Kerkyacharian (2004). We do not assume that the errors
are normally distributed, and we do not assume that $X$ and $\epsilon$ are
independent but, mainly for technical reasons, we will assume, as in most part

$\beta\gamma$ to $\beta\gamma\delta$ configuration over a period of 6 days. The
AR had two sub-regions of activity with opposite chirality: one dominated by
sunspot rotation producing a strong CME, the other showing large shear motions
producing a strong flare. The net current in each polarity over the CME
producing sub-region increased to a maximum and then decreased when the
sunspots got separated. The time profile of net current in this sub-region
followed the time profile of the rotation rate of the S-polarity sunspot of the
same sub-region. The net current in the flaring sub-region showed a sudden
increase at the time of the strong flare and remained unchanged till the end of
the observation, while the sunspots maintained their close proximity. The
systematic evolution of the observed net current is seen to follow the time
evolution of total length of strongly sheared polarity inversion lines in both
the sub-regions. The observed photospheric net current could be explained as an
inevitable product of the emergence of a twisted flux rope, from a higher
pressure confinement below the photosphere into the lower pressure environment
of the photosphere.

Markov chain Monte Carlo. In particular, if a conditionally conjugate prior is

Hobert [Linear Algebra Appl. 473 (2015) 54-77] showed that, when the priors are
proper and the $X$ matrix has full column rank, the Markov chains underlying
these Gibbs samplers are nearly always geometrically ergodic. In this paper,
Rom\'{a}n and Hobert's (2015) result is extended by allowing improper priors on
the variance components, and, more importantly, by removing all assumptions on
the $X$ matrix. So, not only is $X$ allowed to be (column) rank deficient,
which provides additional flexibility in parameterizing the fixed effects, it
is also allowed to have more columns than rows, which is necessary in the
increasingly important situation where $p>N$. The full rank assumption on $X$
is at the heart of Rom\'{a}n and Hobert's (2015) proof. Consequently, the
extension to unrestricted $X$ requires a substantially different analysis.

extraction from clinical documents, i.e., on algorithms capable of extracting,
from the informal and unstructured texts that are generated during everyday
clinical practice, mentions of concepts relevant to such practice. Most of this
literature is about methods based on supervised learning, i.e., methods for
training an information extraction system from manually annotated examples.
While a lot of work has been devoted to devising learning methods that generate
more and more accurate information extractors, no work has been devoted to
investigating the effect of the quality of training data on the learning
process. Low quality in training data often derives from the fact that the
person who has annotated the data is different from the one against whose
judgment the automatically annotated data must be evaluated. In this paper we
test the impact of such data quality issues on the accuracy of information
extraction systems as applied to the clinical domain. We do this by comparing
the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by the authoritative coder
(i.e., the one who has also annotated the test data, and by whose judgment we
must abide), with the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by a
different coder. The results indicate that, although the disagreement between
the two coders (as measured on the training set) is substantial, the difference
is (surprisingly enough) not always statistically significant.

of the tectonic plate to the active zone, triggering the earthquake.
Oscillation frequencies of the plate and ones of the active zone are tuned to a
resonance by an additional compression applied to the active zone due to
collision of neighboring plates or the magma flow in the liquid underlay of the
astenosphere ( the upper mantle). In the case when there are three or more SGO

The model is designed to explicitly account for the dependence on the contact
angle between the two fluids and the solid surface. The Lorentz reciprocal
theorem is applied in the context of a geometric perturbation approach, which
is based on the deviation of the contact angle from a 90{\deg}-value. By
testing the model against experimental and numerical data from the literature,
good agreement is found within the entire range of contact angles below

Quantification has several applications in data and text mining, such as
estimating the prevalence of positive reviews in a set of reviews of a given
product, or estimating the prevalence of a given support issue in a dataset of
transcripts of phone calls to tech support. So far, quantification has been
addressed by learning a general-purpose classifier, counting the unlabelled
items which have been assigned the class, and tuning the obtained counts
according to some heuristics. In this paper we depart from the tradition of
using general-purpose classifiers, and use instead a supervised learning model
for \emph{structured prediction}, capable of generating classifiers directly
optimized for the (multivariate and non-linear) function used for evaluating
quantification accuracy. The experiments that we have run on 5500 binary
high-dimensional datasets (averaging more than 14,000 documents each) show that
this method is more accurate, more stable, and more efficient than existing,
state-of-the-art quantification methods.

$f(R)$ gravity has been considered in order to address consistently the problem
of cosmic evolution. It is possible to show that the deceleration parameter
changes sign at a given redshift according to observational data. Furthermore,
a $f(R)$ gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane
system starting from the very early universe and accounting for the
cosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late
time acceleration. Here we propose a $f(R)$ model where transition redshifts
correspond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration
transitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was
born, due to the transition of $k$ black fundamental strings to the BIon
configuration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with
reducing temperature ($z\sim T^{2}$). The BIon is a configuration in flat space
of a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole.
This wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our
universe, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as $z\sim
T^{4+1/7}$. Dynamics consists with the fact that the wormhole misses its energy
and vanishes as soon as inflation ends and deceleration begins. Approaching two
universe branes together, a tachyon is originated, it grows up and causes the
formation of a wormhole. We show that, in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, the
cosmological redshift depends on the tachyonic potential and has a significant
decrease at deceleration-late time acceleration transition point ($z\sim
T^{2/3}$). As soon as today acceleration approaches, the redshift tends to zero
and the cosmological model reduces to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

magnetopause where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere

region an important site for plasma turbulence, instabilities, reconnection and
plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfv\'en Mach number solar wind and
a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both
physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's. The polar flattening is
predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the
solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in
the magnetosheath with the expectation that polar flattening is manifested in
the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between
2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an
analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric
boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad
agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations

based on no polar flattening, suggest that non-axisymmetry is invariably a key
feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a

energy (VHE, E>20 GeV) photons and charged particles while suppressing
signatures from background light. The trigger comprises three stages. A first
stage employs programmable discriminators to digitize the signals arriving from
the camera channels (pixels). At the second stage, a grid of low-cost FPGAs is
used to process the digitized signals for camera regions with 37 pixels. At the
third stage, trigger conditions found independently in any of the overlapping
37-pixel regions are combined into a global camera trigger by few central
FPGAs. Trigger prototype boards based on Xilinx FPGAs have been designed, built
and tested and were shown to function properly. Using these components a full
camera trigger with a power consumption and price per channel of about 0.5 W
and 19 Euro, respectively, can be built. With the described design the camera
trigger algorithm can take advantage of pixel information in both the space and
the time domain allowing, for example, the creation of triggers sensitive to
the time-gradient of a shower image; the time information could also be
exploited to online adjust the time window of the acquisition system for pixel
data. Combining the results of the parallel execution of different trigger
algorithms (optimized, for example, for the lowest and highest energies,
respectively) on each FPGA can result in a better response over all photons

important determinants of the generation time. For instance, semelparous
species whose adults reproduce once and die have shorter generation times than
iteroparous species that reproduce on several occasions. A shorter generation
time ensures a higher growth rate in stable environments where resources are in
excess, and is therefore a positively selected feature in this (rarely met)
situation. In a stable and limiting environment, all combination of traits (or
strategies) that produce the same number of viable offspring on average are
strictly neutral even when their generation times differ. We first study the
evolution of life-history strategies with different generation times in this
context, and show that those with the longest generation time represent the
most likely evolutionary outcomes. Indeed, strategies with longer generation
times generate fewer mutants per time unit, which makes them less likely to be
replaced within a given time period. This `turnover bias' inevitably exists and
favors the evolution of strategies with long generation times. Its real impact,
however, should depend on the strength and direction of other evolutionary
forces; selection for short generation times, for instance, may oppose turnover
bias. Likewise, the evolutionary outcome depends on the strength of such
selection and population size, comparably to other biases acting on the
occurrence of mutations.

time-reversible Markov chains is a fundamental building block in many heuristic
approaches to algorithmically hard problems. It has been conjectured that
quantum analogs of classical mixing processes may offer a generic quadratic
speed-up in realizing such stationary distributions. Such a speed-up would also
imply a speed-up of a broad family of heuristic algorithms.
  However, a true quadratic speed up has thus far only been demonstrated for
special classes of Markov chains. These results often presuppose a regular
structure of the underlying graph of the Markov chain, and also a regularity in
the transition probabilities.
  In this work, we demonstrate a true quadratic speed-up for a class of Markov
chains where the restriction is only on the form of the stationary
distribution, rather than directly on the Markov chain structure itself. In
particular, we show efficient mixing can be achieved when it is beforehand
known that the distribution is monotonically decreasing relative to a known
order on the state space. Following this, we show that our approach extends to
a wider class of distributions, where only a fraction of the shape of the
distribution is known to be monotonic. Our approach is built on the
Szegedy-type quantization of transition operators.

motion of the Sun and a star from their current positions to the proximity
epoch. For this calculations we used a numerical integration in rectangular,
Galactocentric coordinates. We showed that in many cases the numerical
integration of the star motion gives significantly different results than
popular rectilinear approximation.We found several new stellar candidates for
close visitors in past or in future. We used a covariance matrices of the
astrometric data for each star to estimate the accuracy of the obtained
proximity distance and epoch. To this aim we used a Monte Carlo method,
replaced each star with 10 000 of its clones and studied the distribution of
their individual close passages near the Sun. We showed that for contemporary
close neighbours the precision is quite good but for more distant stars it
strongly depends on the quality of astrometric and kinematic data. Several
examples are discussed in detail, among them the case of HIP 14473. For this

Transversely excited modes obey the dispersion relation of microfluidic phonons

Moreover, we investigate the long-time behaviour of the oscillations and
discuss possible mechanisms for the onset of instabilities. Our findings
demonstrate that the collective dynamics of microfluidic droplet ensembles can
be studied particularly well in dense and confined systems. Experimentally, the
ability to control microfluidic droplets may allow to modulate the refractive
index of optofluidic crystals which is a promising approach for the production
of dynamically programmable metamaterials.

discredit this possibility on the basis of FORS2 spectro-polarimetry, which
allows us to rule out a mean longitudinal magnetic field down to 300 G.
  Using the same data, we derive the atmospheric parameters for LS

5.88$\pm$0.02 and $\log{N(\rm He)/N(\rm H)}$ = $-$0.62$\pm$0.01. The high

it is on a retrograde orbit around the Galactic centre, with a Galactic radial

equation on spacetime. This property is lost for non constant scalar fields, in
fact there appear new terms that have been interpreted mainly as new forces or
as due to a variable inertial mass and/or charge. Here we prove that the
additional terms can be removed if we assume that charged particles are coupled
with the same spacetime conformal structure of neutral particles but through a
different conformal factor. As a consequence, in Kaluza-Klein theory the proper
time of the charged particle might depend on the charge-to-mass ratio and the
scalar field. Then we show that the compatibility between the equation of the
projected geodesic and the classical limit of the Klein-Gordon equation fixes
unambiguously the conformal factor of the coupling metric solving the
`conformal ambiguity problem' of Kaluza-Klein theories. We confirm this result
by explicitly constructing the projection of the Klein-Gordon equation and by

counterpart of 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission (MME) in W42 (i.e. W42-MME). We
also investigate that W42-MME drives a parsec-scale H2 outflow, with detection
of bow shock feature at ~0.52 pc to the north. The inner ~0.4 pc part of the H2
outflow has a position angle of ~18 deg and the position angle of ~40 deg is
found farther away on either side of outflow from W42-MME. W42-MME is detected
at wavelengths longer than 2.2 microns and is a massive young stellar object,
with the estimated stellar mass of 19+-4 Msun. We map the inner circumstellar
environment of W42-MME using VLT/NACO adaptive optics Ks and L' observations at
resolutions ~0.2 arcsec and ~0.1 arcsec, respectively. We discover a collimated
jet in the inner 4500 AU using the L' band, which contains prominent Br alpha
line emission. The jet is located inside an envelope/cavity (extent ~10640 AU)
that is tapered at both ends and is oriented along the north-south direction.
Such observed morphology of outflow cavity around massive star is scarcely
known and is very crucial for understanding the jet-outflow formation process
in massive star formation. Along the flow axis, which is parallel to the
previously known magnetic field, two blobs are found in both the NACO images at
distances of ~11800 AU, located symmetrically from W42-MME. The observed
W42-MME jet-outflow configuration can be used to constrain the jet launching
and jet collimation models in massive star formation.

have to follow effective decision-making strategies. We refer to this as the
cyber security investment challenge. In this paper, we consider three possible
decision-support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge.
We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation and a
hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can
investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the
protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity
threats. In terms of game theory we consider a 2-person control game between
the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of
a cyber security control, and a commodity attacker who chooses among different
targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large
game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game
solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g.
financial) are combined with a knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal
investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a
multi-objective multiple choice knapsack based strategy. We compare these
approaches on a case study that was built on SANS top critical controls. The
main achievements of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of
different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their
interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security
investment.

reachability analysis for Branching Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs).
Specifically, given a BMDP, and given an initial population, where the
objective of the controller is to maximize (or minimize) the probability of
eventually reaching a population that contains an object of a desired (or
undesired) type, we give algorithms for approximating the supremum (infimum)
reachability probability, within desired precision epsilon > 0, in time
polynomial in the encoding size of the BMDP and in log(1/epsilon). We
furthermore give P-time algorithms for computing epsilon-optimal strategies for
both maximization and minimization of reachability probabilities. We also give
P-time algorithms for all associated qualitative analysis problems, namely:
deciding whether the optimal (supremum or infimum) reachability probabilities
are 0 or 1. Prior to this paper, approximation of optimal reachability
probabilities for BMDPs was not even known to be decidable.
  Our algorithms exploit the following basic fact: we show that for any BMDP,
its maximum (minimum) non-reachability probabilities are given by the greatest
fixed point (GFP) solution g* in [0,1]^n of a corresponding monotone max (min)
Probabilistic Polynomial System of equations (max/min-PPS), x=P(x), which are
the Bellman optimality equations for a BMDP with non-reachability objectives.
We show how to compute the GFP of max/min PPSs to desired precision in P-time.
  We also study more general Branching Simple Stochastic Games (BSSGs) with
(non-)reachability objectives. We show that: (1) the value of these games is
captured by the GFP of a corresponding max-minPPS; (2) the quantitative problem
of approximating the value is in TFNP; and (3) the qualitative problems
associated with the value are all solvable in P-time.

depends on the cardinality of the metric, and one could not specify in advance
which vertices/points should enjoy a better service (i.e., stretch/distortion,
label size/dimension) than that given by the worst-case guarantee.
  In this paper we alleviate this limitation by devising a suit of {\em

priority ranking $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ of the graph vertices (respectively,
metric points) one can devise a metric data structure (respectively, embedding)

solutions do not make full use of trajectory planning of nearby vehicles, or
social attributes. The development of onboard navigation system provides
drivers some traveling route information. The main novelty of our approach is
to envision sharing partial traveling information to the encountered vehicles
for better service. Our data forwarding algorithm utilizes this lightweight
information under the delusive paths privacy preservation together with the
social community structure in vehicular networks. We assume that data
transmission is carried by vehicles and road side units (RSUs), while cellular
network manages and coordinates relevant global information. The approximate
destination set is the set of RSUs that are often passed by the destination
vehicle. RSU importance is raised by summing encounter ratios of RSUs in the
same connected component. We first define a concept of space-time
approachability which is derived from shared partial traveling route and
encounter information. It describes the capability of a vehicle to advance
messages toward destination. Then, we design a novel data forwarding algorithm,
called approachability based algorithm, which combines the space-time
approachability with the social community attribute in vehicular networks. We
evaluate our approachability based algorithm on data sets from San Francisco
Cabspotting and Shanghai Taxi Movement. Results show that the partially shared
traveling information plays a positive role in data forwarding in vehicular
networks. Approachability based data forwarding algorithm achieves a better
performance than existing social based algorithms in vehicular networks.

gravity) in high-acceleration regimes, and reproduce the phenomenology of the
modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the low-acceleration, non-relativistic
limit. Like in khronometric theory, Lorentz symmetry is violated in these
theories by introducing a dynamical scalar field (the ""khronon"") whose gradient
is enforced to be timelike. As a result, hypersurfaces of constant khronon
define a preferred foliation of the spacetime, and the khronon can be thought
of as a physical absolute time. The MOND phenomenology arises as a result of
the presence, in the action, of terms depending on the acceleration of the
congruence orthogonal to the preferred foliation. We find that if the theory is
forced to reduce exactly to General Relativity (rather than to khronometric
theory) in the high-acceleration regime, the post-Newtonian expansion breaks
down at low accelerations, and the theory becomes strongly coupled.
Nevertheless, we identify a sizeable region of the parameter space where the
post-Newtonian expansion remains perturbative for all accelerations, and the
theory passes both solar-system and pulsar gravity tests, besides producing a
MOND phenomenology for the rotation curves of galaxies. We illustrate this
explicitly with a toy model of a system containing only baryonic matter but no
Dark Matter.

and frequency variation of a single pressure mode at $\nu=13.3942$ d$^{-1}$ by
2 yr. Analysis of the combined data sets, spanning 6 yr, show that the
amplitude modulation in KIC 7106205 has a much larger range than a previous
study of the Kepler data alone indicated. The single pressure mode decreased
from $11.70 \pm 0.05$ mmag in 2007, to $5.87 \pm 0.03$ mmag in 2009, and to
$0.58 \pm 0.06$ mmag in 2013. Observations of the decrease in mode amplitude

self-assembly systems and general aTAM systems. Mismatch free systems are those
systems in which concurrently grown parts must always agree with each other.
  Tile self-assembly is a model of the formation of crystal growth, in which a
large number of particles concurrently and selectively stick to each other,
forming complex shapes and structures. It is useful in nanotechnologies, and
more generally in the understanding of these processes, ubiquitous in natural
systems.
  The other property of the local assembly process known to change the power of
the model is cooperation between two tiles to attach another. We show that
disagreement (mismatches) and cooperation are incomparable: neither can be used
to simulate the other one.
  The fact that mismatches are a hard property is especially surprising, since
no known, explicit construction of a computational device in tile assembly uses
mismatches, except for the recent construction of an intrinsically universal
tileset, i.e. a tileset capable of simulating any other tileset up to
rescaling. This work shows how to use intrinsic universality in a systematic
way to highlight the essence of different features of tile assembly.
  Moreover, even the most recent experimental realizations do not use
competition, which, in view of our results, suggests that a large part of the
natural phenomena behind DNA self-assembly remains to be understood
experimentally.

  In particular, it follows that $|(A+A)(A+A)| \gg \frac{|A|^2}{\log |A|}$. The
latter inequality had in fact already been established in an earlier work of
the author and Rudnev (arXiv:1203.6237), which built upon the recent
developments of Guth and Katz (arXiv:1011.4105) in their work on the Erd\H{o}s
distinct distance problem. Here, we do not use those relatively deep methods,
and instead we need just a single application of the Szemer\'{e}di-Trotter
Theorem. The result is also qualitatively stronger than the corresponding
sum-product estimate from (arXiv:1203.6237), since the set $(a+A)(b+A)$ is
defined by only two variables, rather than four. One can view this as a
solution for the pinned distance problem, under an alternative notion of
distance, in the special case when the point set is a direct product $A \times
A$. Another advantage of this more elementary approach is that these results
can now be extended for the first time to the case when $A \subset \mathbb C$.

computationally intensive, requiring $O(t^4)$ running time to map a network of

site is the topos of functors from the multiplicative semigroup of non-zero
natural numbers to the category of sets. The structure sheaf is made by
semirings of characteristic one and is given globally by the semifield of
tropical integers. In spite of the countable combinatorial nature of the
arithmetic site, this space admits a one parameter semigroup of Frobenius
correspondences obtained as sub-varieties of the square of the site. This
square is a semi-ringed topos whose structure sheaf involves Newton polygons.

gravity driven free-surface flow of concentrated suspensions. They are usually
believed to be the result of fluid convection in combination with particle size
segregation. However, suspensions composed of uniformly sized particles also
develop a granular front. Within a large rotating drum, a stationary
recirculating avalanche is generated. The flowing material is a mixture of a
visco-plastic fluid obtained from a kaolin-water dispersion, with spherical
ceramic particles denser than the fluid. The goal is to mimic the composition
of many common granular-fluid materials, like fresh concrete or debris flow. In
these materials, granular and fluid phases have the natural tendency to
segregate due to particle settling. However, through the shearing caused by the
rotation of the drum, a reorganization of the phases is induced, leading to the
formation of a granular front. By tuning the material properties and the drum
velocity, it is possible to control this phenomenon. The setting is reproduced
in a numerical environment, where the fluid is solved by a Lattice-Boltzmann
Method, and the particles are explicitly represented using the Discrete Element
Method. The simulations confirm the findings of the experiments, and provide
insight into the internal mechanisms. Comparing the time-scale of particle
settling with the one of particle recirculation, a non-dimensional number is
defined, and is found to be effective in predicting the formation of a granular
front.

measured average turbulent scalings of the density and velocity fields in the
stability analysis, we can more robustly characterize the average level of

manner identify scales prone to fragmentation. Furthermore, we find that the
stability of a disc with feedback-driven turbulence can be well described by a
""Toomre-like"" $Q$ stability criterion on all scales, whereas the classical $Q$
can formally lose its meaning on small scales if violent disc instabilities
occur in models lacking pressure support from stellar feedback.

sizes in a given configuration and a new exponent was introduced to explain its
scaling with the size of the system. In thermal spin models, however, physical
clusters take into account the temperature-dependent correlation between
neighboring spins and encode the critical properties of the phase transition.
We here extend the measure of $H$ to these clusters and, moreover, present new
results for the geometric domains for both $d=2$ and 3. We show that the
heterogeneity associated with geometric domains has a previously unnoticed
double peak, thus being able to detect both the thermal and percolative
transition. An alternative interpretation for the scaling of $H$ that does not
introduce a new exponent is also proposed.

BS antennas is adopted. In this context, either linear or reduced-complexity
iterative DF detection techniques are considered. Regarding performance
evaluation by simulation, appropriate semi-analytical methods are proposed.
This paper includes a detailed evaluation of BER performances for uncoded
4-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (4-QAM) schemes and a MU-MIMO channel with
uncorrelated Rayleigh fading. The accuracy of performance results obtained
through the semi-analytical simulation methods is assessed by means of parallel
conventional Monte Carlo simulations, under the assumptions of perfect power
control and perfect channel estimation. The performance results are discussed
in detail, with the help of selected performance bounds. We emphasize that a
moderately large number of BS antennas is enough to closely approximate the
SIMO MFB performance, especially when using the suggested low-complexity
iterative DF technique, which does not require matrix inversion operations. We
also emphasize the achievable ""massive MIMO"" effects, even for strongly
reduced-complexity linear detection techniques, provided that the number of BS
antennas is much higher than the number of antennas which are jointly employed
in the terminals of the multiple autonomous users.

evolution models and observed stellar Li abundances suggest that at least half
of the present Li abundance may have been produced in red giants, asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars, and novae. However, no direct evidence for the supply
of Li from stellar objects to the Galactic medium has yet been found. Here we
report on the detection of highly blue-shifted resonance lines of the singly
ionized radioactive isotope of beryllium, $^{7}$Be, in the near ultraviolet
(UV) spectra of the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013). Spectra were
obtained 38 to 48 days after the explosion. $^{7}$Be decays to form $^{7}$Li
within a short time (half-life 53.22 days). The spectroscopic detection of this
fragile isotope implies that it has been created during the nova explosion via
the reaction $^{3}\mbox{He}(\alpha,\gamma)^{7}\mbox{Be}$, and supports the
theoretical prediction that a significant amount of $^{7}$Li could be produced
in classical nova explosions. This finding opens a new way to explore $^{7}$Li
production in classical novae and provides a clue to the mystery of the
Galactic evolution of lithium.

further development of solar observing modes for ALMA and at promoting
scientific opportunities for solar physics with particular focus on numerical
simulations, which can provide important constraints for the observing modes

of edge states in this geometry and persists for any Fermi level in the QSH

  Keying","9 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates and confirms one advantageous function of a power
packet dispatching system, which has been proposed by authors' group with being
apart from the conventional power distribution system. Here is focused on the
function to establish the security of power packet dispatching for prohibiting
not only information but also power of power packet from being stolen by
attackers. For the purpose of protecting power packets, we introduce a simple
encryption of power packets before sending them. Encryption scheme based on
chaotic signal is one possibility for this purpose. This paper adopts the
Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) scheme for the encryption, those are
partial power packet encryption and whole power packet encryption.

superparamagnetic phase has been studied by means of a direct molecular
dynamics simulation. The equilibrium structures of the ferrofluid aggregate
nucleus are obtained for different values of a temperature and an external
magnetic field magnitude. An approximate match of experiment and simulation has
been shown for the ferrofluid phase diagram coordinates ""field-temperature"".
The provided phase coexistence curve has an opposite trend comparing to some of
known theoretical results. This contradiction has been discussed. For given
experimental parameters, it has been concluded that the present results
describe more precisely the transition from linear chains to a dense globes
phase. The theoretical concepts which provide the opposite binodal curve
dependency trend match other experimental conditions: a diluted ferrofluid, a
high particle coating rate, a high temperature, and/or a less particles
coupling constant value.

fixed number of roots on the complex unit circle. We also prove that these
roots are simple when that condition is satisfied. This generalizes the
condition found by Lakatos and Losonczi for all the roots of a self-inversive
polynomial to lie on the complex unit circle.
