highly stable, which opens perspectives for application as single-atom memory.
A specific example is a single holmium atom (with $J=8$) on a platinum (111)
surface for which exceptionally long lifetimes were observed in recent scanning
tunneling microscopy studies. For control and read-out the atom must be coupled
to electronic contacts. Hence the spin dynamics of the system is governed by a
quantum master equation. Our analysis shows that in general it cannot be
reduced to a classical master equation in the basis of the unperturbed
crystal-field Hamiltonian. Rather, depending on parameters and control fields,
""environment induced superselection"" principles choose the appropriate set of
basis states, which in turn determines the specific relaxation channels and
lifetimes. Our simulations suggest that in ideal situations the lifetimes
should be even longer than observed in the experiment. We, therefore,
investigate the influence of various perturbations. We also study the
initialization process of the state of the Ho atom by applied voltage pulses
and conclude that fast, high fidelity preparation, on a $100\,\text{ns}$
timescale, should be possible.

effectiveness of a dynamical decoupling protocol for qubits undergoing pure
dephasing. We consider an exact model in which dephasing arises due to a
bosonic environment with a spectral density of the Ohmic class. This is
parametrised by an Ohmicity parameter by changing which we can model both
Markovian and non-Markovian environments. Interestingly, we find that
engineering a non-Markovian environment is detrimental to the efficiency of the
dynamical decoupling scheme, leading to a worse coherence preservation. We show
that each dynamical decoupling pulse reverses the flow of quantum information
and, on this basis, we investigate the connection between dynamical decoupling
efficiency and the reservoir spectral density. Finally, in the spirit of
reservoir engineering, we investigate the optimum system-reservoir parameters
for achieving maximum stationary coherences.

tracking (LCT) routine to retrieve horizontal velocities using numerical
simulations of convection. LCT was applied on a time sequence of temperature
maps generated by the Nirvana code with four different apodizing windows,
namely--Gaussian, Lorentzian, trapezoidal and triangular, with varying widths.
In terms of correlations (between the LCT-retrieved and simulated flow field),
the triangular and the trapezoidal perform the best and worst, respectively. On
segregating the intrinsic velocities in the simulations on the basis of their
magnitudes, we find that for all windows, a significantly higher correlation is
obtained for the intermediate and high-velocity bins and only modest or weak
values in the low-velocity bins. The differences between the LCT-retrieved and
simulated flow fields were determined spatially which show large residuals at
or close to the boundary of granules. The extent to which the horizontal flow
vectors retrieved by LCT compare with the simulated values, depends entirely on
the width of the central peak of the apodizing window for a given $\sigma$.
Even though LCT suffers from a lack of spatial content as seen in simulations,
its simplicity and speed could serve as a viable first-order tool to probe
horizontal flows--one that is ideal for large data sets.

naturally defines a reversible Markov process, and a corresponding Laplace
operator acting on functions on $V$, voltage distributions. The harmonic
functions are of special importance. We establish explicit boundary
representations for the harmonic functions on $G$ of finite energy.
  We compute a resistance metric $d$ from a given conductance function. (The
resistance distance $d(x,y)$ between two vertices $x$ and $y$ is the voltage
drop from $x$ to $y$, which is induced by the given assignment of resistors
when 1 amp is inserted at the vertex $x$, and then extracted again at $y$.)
  We study the class of models where this resistance metric is bounded. We show
that then the finite-energy functions form an algebra of
$\frac{1}{2}$-Lipschitz-continuous and bounded functions on $V$, relative to
the metric $d$. We further show that, in this case, the metric completion $M$

Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a paradigm that enables simulation-based
posterior inference in such cases by measuring the similarity between simulated

there is no general rule to construct sufficient summary statistics for complex

ABC algorithms yielding samples from an incorrect (partial) posterior. In this
paper, we propose a fully nonparametric ABC paradigm which circumvents the need
for manually selecting summary statistics. Our approach, K2-ABC, uses maximum
mean discrepancy (MMD) as a dissimilarity measure between the distributions
over observed and simulated data. MMD is easily estimated as the squared

Observatory (SDO) observes the Sun at the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line and returns
full-disk maps of line-of-sight (LOS) observables including the magnetic flux
density, velocities, Fe I line width, line depth, and continuum intensity.
These data are estimated through an algorithm (the MDI-like algorithm,
hereafter), which combines observables obtained at six wavelength positions
within the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line. To properly interpret such data it is
important to understand any effects of the instrument and the pipeline that
generates these data products. We tested the accuracy of the line width, line
depth, and continuum intensity returned by the MDI-like algorithm using various
one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models. It was found that HMI estimates of
these quantities are highly dependent on the shape of the line, therefore on
the LOS angle and the magnetic flux density associated with the model, and less
to line shifts with respect to the central positions of the instrument
transmission profiles. In general, the relative difference between synthesized
values and HMI estimates increases toward the limb and with the increase of the
field; the MDI-like algorithm seems to fail in regions with fields larger than
approximately 2000 G.
  Instrumental effects were investigated by the analysis of HMI data obtained
at daily intervals for a span of three years at disk center in the quiet Sun
and hourly intervals for a span of 200 hours. The analysis revealed
periodicities induced by the variation of the orbital velocity of the
observatory with respect to the Sun, and long-term trends attributed to
instrument adjustments, re-calibrations and instrumental degradation.

emissivity we have selected faint AGN candidates at $z>4$ in the CANDELS
GOODS-South field which is one of the deepest fields with extensive
multiwavelength coverage from Chandra, HST, Spitzer and various groundbased
telescopes. We have adopted a relatively novel criterion. As a first step high
redshift galaxies are selected in the NIR $H$ band down to very faint levels
($H\leq27$) using reliable photometric redshifts. This corresponds at $z>4$ to
a selection criterion based on the galaxy rest-frame UV flux. AGN candidates
are then picked up from this parent sample if they show X-ray fluxes above a
threshold of $F_X\sim 1.5\times 10^{-17}$ cgs (0.5-2 keV). We have found 22 AGN
candidates at $z>4$ and we have derived the first estimate of the UV luminosity
function in the redshift interval $4<z<6.5$ and absolute magnitude interval
$-22.5\lesssim M_{1450} \lesssim -18.5$ typical of local Seyfert galaxies. The
faint end of the derived luminosity function is about two/four magnitudes
fainter at $z\sim 4-6$ than that derived from previous UV surveys. We have then
estimated ionizing emissivities and hydrogen photoionization rates in the same
redshift interval under reasonable assumptions and after discussion of possible
caveats, the most important being the large uncertainties involved in the
estimate of photometric redshift for sources with featureless, almost power-law
SEDs and/or low average escape fraction of ionizing photons from the AGN host
galaxies. We argue that, under reasonable evaluations of possible biases, the
probed AGN population can produce at $z=4-6.5$ photoionization rates consistent
with that required to keep highly ionized the intergalactic medium observed in
the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift QSO spectra, providing an important
contribution to the cosmic reionization.

$\mathcal{O}(\bar{v}_T^2/\Lambda^2)$ valid on and off the $Z$ pole, in the
massless fermion limit. We demonstrate that previously neglected corrections
scale as $\Gamma_Z M_Z/\bar{v}_T^2$ in the partial widths extracted from
measured cross sections at LEPI, compared to the leading effect of dimension
six operators in anomalous $Z$ couplings. Further, constraints on leading
effects of anomalous $Z$ couplings are also modified by neglected perturbative
corrections and dimension eight operators. We perform a minimal EWPD fit to
illustrate the size of the error these corrections induce, when bounding
leading effects. These considerations relax bounds compared to a naive leading
order analysis, and show that constraints that rise above the percent level are
subject to substantial theoretical uncertanties. We also argue that
renormalization group running global constraints expressed through $\chi^2$

robustness property allows the composition of this protocol with a
device-independent state tomography protocol that we give, which is based on
the rigidity of CHSH games as proposed by Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013).
The resulting composite protocol has lower round complexity for the

Brillouin zone. With inversion symmetry breaking, we find chiral phonons with
valley contrasting circular polarization and ionic magnetic moment. At valley
centers, there is a three-fold rotational symmetry endowing phonons with a
quantized pseudo angular momentum, which includes spin and orbital parts. From
conservation of the pseudo angular momentum, crystal momentum and energy,
selection rules in intervalley scattering of electrons by phonons are obtained.
The chiral valley phonons are verified and the selection rules are predicted in
monolayer Molybdenum disulfide. Due to valley contrasting phonon Berry
curvature, one can also detect a valley phonon Hall effect. The
valley-contrasting chiral phonon, together with phonon circular polarization,
ionic magnetic moment, phonon pseudo angular momentum, valley phonon Hall

number of clusters, and checking whether the population to be clustered is not
actually homogeneous. Given a dataset, a clustering method and a cluster
validation index, this paper proposes to set up null models that capture
structural features of the data that cannot be interpreted as indicating
clustering. Artificial datasets are sampled from the null model with parameters
estimated from the original dataset. This can be used for testing the null
hypothesis of a homogeneous population against a clustering alternative. It can
also be used to calibrate the validation index for estimating the number of
clusters, by taking into account the expected distribution of the index under
the null model for any given number of clusters. The approach is illustrated by
three examples, involving various different clustering techniques (partitioning
around medoids, hierarchical methods, a Gaussian mixture model), validation
indexes (average silhouette width, prediction strength and BIC), and issues
such as mixed type data, temporal and spatial autocorrelation.

consider the case that, in the absence of RSF, the surfaces of the film belong
to the surface universality class of the so-called ordinary transition.
  We carry out a finite-size scaling analysis and show that for weak disorder
CCF still exhibit scaling, acquiring a random field scaling variable $w$ which
is zero for pure systems. We confirm these analytic predictions by MC
simulations. Moreover, our MC data show that $f_{\mathrm C}$ varies as
$f_{\mathrm C}(w\to 0)-f_{\mathrm C}(w=0)\sim w^2$. Asymptotically, for large
$L$, $w$ scales as $w \sim L^{-0.26} \to 0$ indicating that this type of
disorder is an irrelevant perturbation of the ordinary surface universality
class. However, for thin films such that $w \simeq 1$, we find that the
presence of RSF with vanishing mean value increases significantly the strength
of CCF, as compared to systems without them, and shifts the extremum of the

decay of 130Te with unprecedented sensitivity. Expected to start data taking in
2015, CUORE is currently in an advanced construction phase at LNGS. CUORE
projected neutrinoless double beta decay half-life sensitivity is 1.6E26 y at 1
sigma (9.5E25 y at the 90% confidence level), in five years of live time,
corresponding to an upper limit on the effective Majorana mass in the range
40-100 meV (50-130 meV). Further background rejection with auxiliary bolometric
detectors could improve CUORE sensitivity and competitiveness of bolometric
detectors towards a full analysis of the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.
CUORE-0 was built to test and demonstrate the performance of the upcoming CUORE
experiment. It consists of a single CUORE tower (52 TeO2 bolometers of 750 g
each, arranged in a 13 floor structure) constructed strictly following CUORE
recipes both for materials and assembly procedures. An experiment its own,
CUORE-0 is expected to reach a sensitivity to the neutrinoless double beta
decay half-life of 130Te around 3E24 y in one year of live time. We present an
update of the data, corresponding to an exposure of 18.1 kg y. An analysis of
the background indicates that the CUORE performance goal is satisfied while the
sensitivity goal is within reach.

discovered in deep networks, namely their instability to adversarial
perturbations (Szegedy et. al., 2014). We provide a theoretical framework for
analyzing the robustness of classifiers to adversarial perturbations, and show
fundamental upper bounds on the robustness of classifiers. Specifically, we
establish a general upper bound on the robustness of classifiers to adversarial
perturbations, and then illustrate the obtained upper bound on the families of
linear and quadratic classifiers. In both cases, our upper bound depends on a
distinguishability measure that captures the notion of difficulty of the
classification task. Our results for both classes imply that in tasks involving
small distinguishability, no classifier in the considered set will be robust to
adversarial perturbations, even if a good accuracy is achieved. Our theoretical
framework moreover suggests that the phenomenon of adversarial instability is
due to the low flexibility of classifiers, compared to the difficulty of the
classification task (captured by the distinguishability). Moreover, we show the
existence of a clear distinction between the robustness of a classifier to
random noise and its robustness to adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the
former is shown to be larger than the latter by a factor that is proportional
to \sqrt{d} (with d being the signal dimension) for linear classifiers. This
result gives a theoretical explanation for the discrepancy between the two
robustness properties in high dimensional problems, which was empirically
observed in the context of neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, our
results provide the first theoretical work that addresses the phenomenon of
adversarial instability recently observed for deep networks. Our analysis is
complemented by experimental results on controlled and real-world data.

and the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary
symmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously
contracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every
walk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left,
respectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and
-1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of
them already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different
indices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so
the theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of
bulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a
single gap at zero.

The sensitivity integrated over a ligand concentration range is shown to be
enhanced by the affinity, providing a measure of how much energy consumption
improves sensing. With this integrated sensitivity we can establish an
intriguing analogy between sensing with nonequilibrium receptors and kinetic
proofreading: the increase in integrated sensitivity is equivalent to the
decrease of the error in kinetic proofreading. The influence of the occupancy

literature on short-term asymptotics for financial models with jumps, despite
its importance in model selection and calibration. We rectify this by providing
high-order asymptotic expansions for the at-the-money implied volatility skew,
under a rich class of stochastic volatility models with independent stable-like
jumps of infinite variation. The case of a pure-jump stable-like L\'evy model
is also considered under the minimal possible conditions for the resulting
expansion to be well defined. Unlike recent results for ""near-the-money"" option
prices and implied volatility, the results herein aid in understanding how the
implied volatility smile near expiry is affected by important features of the
continuous component, such as the leverage and vol-of-vol parameters. As
intermediary results we obtain high-order expansions for at-the-money digital
call option prices, which furthermore allow us to infer analogous results for
the delta of at-the-money options. Simulation results indicate that our
asymptotic expansions give good fits for options with maturities up to one
month, underpinning their relevance in practical applications, and an analysis
of the implied volatility skew in recent S&P500 options data shows it to be
consistent with the infinite variation jump component of our models.

operator associated to a weight $\varphi:\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and
acting on $(0,1)$-forms, which plays a key role in several questions of complex
analysis. We consider here the case of model monomial weights in
$\mathbb{C}^2$, i.e., $ \varphi(z,w):=\sum_{(\alpha,\beta)\in\Gamma}|z^\alpha
w^\beta|^2, $ where $\Gamma\subseteq \mathbb{N}^2$ is finite. Our goal is to
prove coercivity estimates of the form $\Box_\varphi\geq \mu^2$, where
$\mu:\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ acts by pointwise multiplication on
$(0,1)$-forms, and the inequality is in the sense of self-adjoint operators. We
recently proved (arxiv.org:1502.00865) how to derive from $\mu$-coercivity

$\mu$-coercivity with $ \mu(z,w)=c(1+|z|^a+|w|^b) \qquad(a,b\geq0),$ where
$a,b\geq0$ depend (and are easily computable from) $\Gamma$. As a corollary we
also prove that, for a wide class of model monomial weights, the spectrum of
$\Box_\varphi$ is discrete if and only if the weight is not decoupled, i.e.
$\Gamma$ contains at least a point $(\alpha,\beta)$ with
$\alpha\neq0\neq\beta$. Our methods comprise a new holomorphic uncertainty

sparse signal reconstruction that combines adaptive step size with Nesterov's
momentum acceleration. The objective function that we wish to minimize is the
sum of a convex differentiable data-fidelity (negative log-likelihood (NLL))
term and a convex regularization term. We apply sparse signal regularization
where the signal belongs to a closed convex set within the closure of the
domain of the NLL; the convex-set constraint facilitates flexible NLL domains
and accurate signal recovery. Signal sparsity is imposed using the
$\ell_1$-norm penalty on the signal's linear transform coefficients or gradient
map, respectively. The PNPG approach employs projected Nesterov's acceleration
step with restart and an inner iteration to compute the proximal mapping. We
propose an adaptive step-size selection scheme to obtain a good local
majorizing function of the NLL and reduce the time spent backtracking. Thanks
to step-size adaptation, PNPG does not require Lipschitz continuity of the
gradient of the NLL. We present an integrated derivation of the momentum
acceleration and its $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ convergence-rate and iterate
convergence proofs, which account for adaptive step-size selection, inexactness
of the iterative proximal mapping, and the convex-set constraint. The tuning of
PNPG is largely application-independent. Tomographic and compressed-sensing
reconstruction experiments with Poisson generalized linear and Gaussian linear
measurement models demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

unified means of expressing and implementing methods that are typically given
disparate treatment in the literature, including transformations via
differentiable functions, Bayesian updating, multi-level and other types of

It especially offers benefit to simulation-type models, because of the value in

oscillations (kHz QPOs) of neutron star low mass X-ray binaries have been
reported from 4U1608-522 and 4U1636-536. Those lags hold prospects for
constraining the origin of the QPO emission. In this paper, we investigate the
spectral-timing properties of both the lower and upper kHz QPOs from the
neutron star binary 4U1728-34, using the entire Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
archive on this source. We show that the lag-energy spectra of the two QPOs are
systematically different: while the lower kHz QPO shows soft lags, the upper
kHz QPO shows either a flat lag-energy spectrum or hard variations lagging
softer variations. This suggests two different QPO-generation mechanisms. We
also performed the first spectral deconvolution of the covariance spectra of
both kHz QPOs. The QPO spectra are consistent with Comptonized blackbody
emission, similar to the one found in the time-averaged spectrum, but with a
higher seed-photon temperature, suggesting that a more compact inner region of
the Comptonization layer (boundary/spreading layer, corona) is responsible for
the QPO emission. Considering our results together with other recent findings,
this leads us to the hypothesis that the lower kHz QPO signal is generated by
coherent oscillations of the compact boundary layer region itself. The upper
kHz QPO signal may then be linked to less-coherent accretion-rate variations
produced in the inner accretion disk, being detected when they reach the
boundary layer.

compact spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively. We look at the representation of
linear bijections $H:\mathcal A\longrightarrow \mathcal B$ by continuous
functions $h:Y\longrightarrow X$ as weighted composition operators. In order to
do it, we extend the notion of Hamming metric to infinite spaces. Our main
result establishes that under some mild conditions, every Hamming isometry can
be represented as a weighted composition operator. Connections to coding theory
are also highlighted.

  Scattering from the Reaction $^3$He$^\uparrow(e,e^\prime)$",,"Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 172502 (2015)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.172502",,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the first measurement of the target single-spin asymmetry, $A_y$,
in quasi-elastic scattering from the inclusive reaction
$^3$He$^{\uparrow}(e,e^\prime)$ on a $^3$He gas target polarized normal to the
lepton scattering plane. Assuming time-reversal invariance, this asymmetry is
strictly zero for one-photon exchange. A non-zero $A_y$ can arise from the
interference between the one- and two-photon exchange processes which is
sensitive to the details of the sub-structure of the nucleon. An experiment
recently completed at Jefferson Lab yielded asymmetries with high statistical
precision at $Q^{2}=$ 0.13, 0.46 and 0.97 GeV$^{2}$. These measurements
demonstrate, for the first time, that the $^3$He asymmetry is clearly non-zero
and negative with a statistical significance of (8-10)$\sigma$. Using measured
proton-to-$^{3}$He cross-section ratios and the effective polarization
approximation, neutron asymmetries of $-$(1-3)% were obtained. The neutron
asymmetry at high $Q^2$ is related to moments of the Generalized Parton
Distributions (GPDs). Our measured neutron asymmetry at $Q^2=0.97$ GeV$^2$
agrees well with a prediction based on two-photon exchange using a GPD model
and thus provides a new, independent constraint on these distributions.

most important issues in Data Mining research. In the last two decades, a great
deal of work has been devoted to the algorithmic aspects of the Frequent
Itemset (FI) Mining problem. We are motivated by the need for formal modeling
in the field. Thus, we introduce and analyze, in this theoretical study, a new
model for the FI mining task. Indeed, we encode the itemsets as words over an
ordered alphabet, and state this problem by a formal series over the counting
semiring $(\mathbb{N},+,\times,0,1)$, whose range constitutes the itemsets and
the coefficients are their supports. This formalism offers many advantages in
both fundamental and practical aspects: the introduction of a clear and unified
theoretical framework through which we can express the main FI-approaches, the
possibility of their generalization to mine other more complex objects, and
their incrementalisation or parallelisation; in practice, we explain how this
problem can be seen as that of word recognition by an automaton, allowing an
efficient implementation in $O(|Q|)$ space and $O(|\mathcal{F}_L||Q|])$ time,
where $Q$ is the set of states of the automaton used for representing the data,
and $\mathcal{F}_L$ the set of prefixial longest FI.

arises in several applications in machine learning and computer vision. The
problem is known to be solvable in polynomial time, but general purpose
algorithms have high running times and are unsuitable for large-scale problems.
Recent work have used convex optimization techniques to obtain very practical
algorithms for minimizing functions that are sums of ``simple"" functions. In
this paper, we use random coordinate descent methods to obtain algorithms with
faster linear convergence rates and cheaper iteration costs. Compared to
alternating projection methods, our algorithms do not rely on full-dimensional
vector operations and they converge in significantly fewer iterations.

two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP), often referred to as phosphorene,
holds significant promise for next generation electronics and optoelectronics.
However, as a 2D material, it possesses a higher surface area to volume ratio
than bulk BP, suggesting that its chemical and thermal stability will be
modified. Herein, an atomic-scale microscopic and spectroscopic study is
performed to characterize the thermal degradation of mechanically exfoliated 2D
BP. From in situ scanning/transmission electron microscopy, decomposition of 2D
BP is observed to occur at ~400 {\deg}C in vacuum, in contrast to the 550
{\deg}C bulk BP sublimation temperature. This decomposition initiates via
eye-shaped cracks along the [001] direction and then continues until only a
thin, amorphous red phosphorous like skeleton remains. In situ electron energy
loss spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and energy-loss
near-edge structure changes provide quantitative insight into this chemical
transformation process.

vibrationally excited CO. Agreement with experimentally-determined results
confirms the accuracy of the potential and scattering computations,

confidential messages (BCCM) is studied in which the nature of channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT) from each user can be of the form
$I_{i}$, $i=1,2$ where $I_{1}, I_{2}\in \{\mathsf{P}, \mathsf{D},
\mathsf{N}\}$, and the forms $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{D}$ and $\mathsf{N}$
correspond to perfect and instantaneous, completely delayed, and no CSIT,
respectively. Thus, the overall CSIT can alternate between $9$ possible states
corresponding to all possible values of $I_{1}I_{2}$, with each state occurring
for $\lambda_{I_{1}I_{2}}$ fraction of the total duration. The main
contribution of this paper is to establish the secure degrees of freedom
(s.d.o.f.) region of the MISO BCCM with alternating CSIT with the symmetry
assumption, where $\lambda_{I_{1} I_{2}}=\lambda_{I_{2}I_{1}}$.
  The main technical contributions include developing a) novel achievable
schemes for MISO BCCM with alternating CSIT with security constraints which
also highlight the synergistic benefits of inter-state coding for secrecy, b)
new converse proofs via local statistical equivalence and channel enhancement;
and c) showing the interplay between various aspects of channel knowledge and
their impact on s.d.o.f.

IceCube neutrino events is presented. By means of multidimensional fits, we
derive the current preferred values of the high-energy neutrino flavor ratios,
the normalization and spectral index of the astrophysical fluxes, and the
expected atmospheric background events, including a prompt component. A crucial
assumption resides on the choice of the energy interval used for the analyses,
which significantly biases the results. When restricting ourselves to the ~30
TeV - 3 PeV energy range, which contains all the observed IceCube events, we
find that the inclusion of the spectral information improves the fit to the
canonical flavor composition at Earth, (1:1:1), with respect to a single-energy
bin analysis. Increasing both the minimum and the maximum deposited energies
has dramatic effects on the reconstructed flavor ratios as well as on the
spectral index. Imposing a higher threshold of 60 TeV yields a slightly harder
spectrum by allowing a larger muon neutrino component, since above this energy
most atmospheric tracklike events are effectively removed. Extending the
high-energy cutoff to fully cover the Glashow resonance region leads to a
softer spectrum and a preference for tau neutrino dominance, as none of the
expected electron antineutrino induced showers have been observed so far. The
lack of showers at energies above 2 PeV may point to a broken power-law
neutrino spectrum. Future data may confirm or falsify whether or not the
recently discovered high-energy neutrino fluxes and the long-standing detected
cosmic rays have a common origin.

rays) on Mrk421 between January 2009 and June 2009, which included VLBA,
F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, Swift, RXTE, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and Whipple, among other
instruments and collaborations. Mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)
activity state, with a VHE flux of about half that of the Crab Nebula, yet the
light curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highest
variability being in the X-rays. We determined the power spectral densities
(PSD) at most wavelengths and found that all PSDs can be described by
power-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noise
behavior. We observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and
measured a positive correlation between VHE and X-ray fluxes with zero time
lag. Such characteristics have been reported many times during flaring
activity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaring
state. We also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/UV and
X-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.
  The harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and the measured
positive X-ray/VHE correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaign
suggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaring
states have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. In
particular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsible
for the emission of Mrk421 during non-flaring activity. Such a temporally
extended X-ray/VHE correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, and
hence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. The
highest variability is observed in the X-ray band, which, within the one-zone
synchrotron self-Compton scenario, indicates that the electron energy
distribution is most variable at the highest energies.

We formulate the classical theory in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian form for a
general non-Abelian gauging, and analyze the constraints and the
Rarita-Schwinger gauge invariance of the action. An explicit wave front
calculation for Abelian gauge fields shows that wave-like modes do not
propagate with superluminal velocities. The quantized case is studied in gauge
covariant radiation gauge and $\Psi_0=0$ gauge for the Rarita-Schwinger field,
by both functional integral and Dirac bracket methods. In $\Psi_0=0$ gauge, the
constraints have the form needed to apply the Faddeev-Popov method for deriving
a functional integral. The Dirac bracket approach in $\Psi_0=0$ gauge yields
consistent Hamilton equations of motion, and in covariant radiation gauge leads
to anticommutation relations with the correct positivity properties. We discuss
relativistic covariance of the anticommutation relations, and of
Rarita-Schwinger scattering from an Abelian potential. We note that fermionic
gauge transformations are a canonical transformation, but further details of
the transformation between different fermionic gauges are left as an open

Palomar 5 (Pal 5), we demonstrate how observational data on streams can be
efficiently reduced in dimensionality and modeled in a Bayesian framework. Our
approach combines detection of stream overdensities by a
Difference-of-Gaussians process with fast streakline models, a continuous
likelihood function built from these models, and inference with MCMC. By
generating $\approx10^7$ model streams, we show that the geometry of the Pal 5
debris yields powerful constraints on the solar position and motion, the Milky
Way and Pal 5 itself. All 10 model parameters were allowed to vary over large
ranges without additional prior information. Using only SDSS data and a few
radial velocities from the literature, we find that the distance of the Sun
from the Galactic Center is $8.30\pm0.25$ kpc, and the transverse velocity is
$253\pm16$ km/s. Both estimates are in excellent agreement with independent
measurements of these quantities. Assuming a standard disk and bulge model, we
determine the Galactic mass within Pal 5's apogalactic radius of 19 kpc to be
$(2.1\pm0.4)\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Moreover, we find the potential of the
dark halo with a flattening of $q_z = 0.95^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ to be essentially
spherical within the radial range that is effectively probed by Pal 5. We also
determine Pal 5's mass, distance and proper motion independently from other
methods, which enables us to perform vital cross-checks. We conclude that with
more observational data and by using additional prior information, the
precision of this method can be significantly increased.

wavelength range of 1.1<lambda<1.7 microns with a resolving power of R~130 for
point sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out to
z~3.5. The catalog is selected in the H-band (F160W) and includes both galaxies
with and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. Grism spectra
are extracted for all H-band detected galaxies with H<24 and a CANDELS
photometric redshift z_phot > 0.6. The resulting spectra are visually inspected
to identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlation
with empirical spectral templates. To establish the accuracy of our redshifts,
we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from the
literature. Using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields a
precision of sigma_NMAD=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which is
consistent with the accuracy reported by the 3D-HST team. Our final catalog
covers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies in
GOODS-S. Roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with no
previously published spectroscopic redshift. These new redshifts span a range
of 0.677 < z < 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. The catalog
contains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z>1.5. In addition, we

coupling is comparable to the free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity, i.e. the
rate at which a qubit can absorb a photon from the cavity is comparable to the
round trip transit rate of a photon in the cavity. We realize, via the circuit

remarkably widespread and structured resonance fluorescence, whose origin
extends beyond cavity enhancement of sidebands. Our results capture complex
multimode, multiphoton processes, and the emergence of ultranarrow linewidths.

spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but the origin of its narrow core
remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the connection between the sizes of the
Fe core emission regions and the measured sizes of the dusty tori in 13 local
Type 1 AGN. The observed Fe K emission radii (R_fe) are determined from
spectrally resolved line widths in X-ray grating spectra, and the dust
sublimation radii (R_dust) are measured either from optical/near-infrared
reverberation time lags or from resolved near-infrared interferometric data.
This direct comparison shows, on an object-by-object basis, that the dust
sublimation radius forms an outer envelope to the bulk of the Fe K emission.
R_fe matches R_dust well in the AGN with the best constrained line widths
currently. In a significant fraction of objects without a clear narrow line
core, R_fe is similar to, or smaller than the radius of the optical broad line
region. These facts place important constraints on the torus geometries for our
sample. Extended tori in which the solid angle of fluorescing gas peaks at well
beyond the dust sublimation radius can be ruled out. We also test for
luminosity scalings of R_fe, finding that Eddington ratio is not a prime driver
in determining the line location in our sample. We discuss in detail potential
caveats due to data analysis and instrumental limitations, simplistic line
modeling, uncertain black hole masses, as well as sample selection, showing
that none of these is likely to bias our core result. The calorimeter on board
Astro-H will soon vastly increase the parameter space over which line
measurements can be made, overcoming many of these limitations.

non-axisymmetric waves in astrophysical discs with an imposed radial
temperature gradient. This might apply, for example, to the outer parts of
protoplanetary discs. We use linear density wave theory to show that
non-axisymmetric perturbations generally do not conserve their angular momentum
in the presence of a forced temperature gradient. This implies an exchange of
angular momentum between linear perturbations and the background disc. In
particular, when the disturbance is a low-frequency trailing wave and the disc
temperature decreases outwards, this interaction is unstable and leads to the
growth of the wave. We demonstrate this phenomenon through numerical
hydrodynamic simulations of locally isothermal discs in 2D using the FARGO code
and in 3D with the ZEUS-MP and PLUTO codes. We consider radially structured
discs with a self-gravitating region which remains stable in the absence of a
temperature gradient. However, when a temperature gradient is imposed we
observe exponential growth of a one-armed spiral mode (azimuthal wavenumber
$m=1$) with co-rotation radius outside the bulk of the spiral arm, resulting in
a nearly-stationary one-armed spiral pattern. The development of this one-armed
spiral does not require the movement of the central star, as found in previous
studies. Because destabilisation by a forced temperature gradient does not
explicitly require disc self-gravity, we suggest this mechanism may also affect
low-frequency one-armed oscillations in non-self-gravitating discs.

quantum systems. The intrinsically non-equilibrium states that result, however,
are challenging to describe and control. We study the steady states of a
periodically driven one-dimensional electronic system, including the effects of
radiative recombination, electron-phonon interactions, and the coupling to an
external fermionic reservoir. Using a kinetic equation for the populations of
the Floquet eigenstates, we show that the steady-state distribution can be
controlled using the momentum and energy relaxation pathways provided by the
coupling to phonon and Fermi reservoirs. In order to utilize the latter, we
propose to couple the system and reservoir via an energy filter which
suppresses photon-assisted tunneling. Importantly, coupling to these reservoirs
yields a steady state resembling a band insulator in the Floquet basis. The
system exhibits incompressible behavior, while hosting a small density of
excitations. We discuss transport signatures, and describe the regimes where
insulating behavior is obtained. Our results give promise for realizing Floquet
topological insulators.

an accreting white dwarf (WD) and the other a larger cooler star that fills its
Roche Lobe. One consequence of the WDs accreting material, is the possibility
that they are growing in mass and will eventually reach the Chandrasekhar
Limit. This evolution could result in a Supernova Ia (SN Ia) explosion and is
designated the Single Degenerate Progenitor (SD) scenario. One problem with the
single degenerate scenario is that it is generally assumed that the accreting
material mixes with WD core material at some time during the accretion phase of
evolution and, since the typical WD has a carbon-oxygen (CO) core, the mixing
results in large amounts of carbon and oxygen being brought up into the
accreted layers. The presence of enriched carbon causes enhanced nuclear fusion
and a Classical Nova (CN)explosion. Thus, the WD in a Classical Nova system is
decreasing in mass and cannot be a SN Ia progenitor. In new calculations
reported here, the consequences to the WD of no mixing of accreted material
with core material have been investigated and the material involved in the
explosion has only a Solar composition. I find that once sufficient material
has been accreted, nuclear burning continues until a thermonuclear runaway
(TNR) occurs and the WD either ejects a small amount of material or its radius
grows to about $10^{12}$ cm and the calculations are stopped. In all cases
where mass ejection occurs, the mass of the ejecta is far less than the mass of
the accreted material. Therefore, all the WDs are growing in mass. (Abridged)

method that allows to write a Ricci curvature-free scalar field equation and
discuss some of the advantages of such rephrasing in the study of stability
issues in the presence of matter, the existence of an Einstein frame and the
generalization of the disformal screening mechanism. For quartic Horndeski

given by the Weyl tensor. This gives rise to a binary classification of
scalar-tensor theories into stirred theories, for which the curvature can be
substituted for, and shaken theories for which a residual coupling to curvature
remains. Quite remarkably, we have found that generalized DBI Galileons belong
to the first class. Finally, we discuss kinetic mixing in quintic theories for
which non-linear mixing terms appears and in the recently proposed theories
beyond Horndeski which display a novel form of kinetic mixing, in which the

nonequilibrium ionization collisional plasma model at a temperature of 1.3-2.6
keV and an ionization timescale of 0.1-1.2$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The

be associated with a giant molecular cloud (MC) at a systemic local standard of
rest velocity of -50 km s$^{-1}$ and confined in a cavity delineated by a
northern molecular shell, a western concave MC that features a discernible
shell, and an HI cloud seen toward the southeast of the SNR. The birth of the
SNR in a preexisting molecular cavity implies a mass of $\gtrsim$18 M$_{\odot}$
for the progenitor if it was not in a binary system. Thermal conduction and
cloudlet evaporation seem to be feasible mechanisms to interpret the X-ray
thermal composite morphology, and the scenario of gas reheating by the shock

as an intense burst in the center of a minihalo that grows above the threshold
for hydrogen cooling (halo mass M_h~10^8 Msun) by undergoing a major merger
within its cooling timescale (~150 Myr). Subsequent minor mergers and sustained
gas infall bring new supply of pristine gas at the halo center, creating
conditions that can trigger new episodes of star formation. The dark-matter
halo around the GC is then stripped during assembly of the host galaxy halo.
Minihalo merging is efficient only in a short redshift window, set by the LCDM
parameters, allowing us to make a strong prediction on the age distribution for
old GCs. From cosmological simulations we derive an average merging redshift
<z>=9 and narrow distribution Dz=2, implying average GC age <t_age>=13.0+/-0.2

model at z~10 may be within reach of ultradeep gravitationally lensed

model that reproduces the observed properties of GRBs detected by Swift, Fermi
and CGRO in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We provide the expected
cumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated GRBs in different

energies (e.g. tens of keV to the MeV), can detect only the most luminous GRBs
at high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and the
luminosity (Ep-Liso) of GRBs. We show that the best strategy for catching the
largest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft X-ray band)
but with a very high sensitivity. For instance, an imaging soft X-ray detector
operating in the 0.2-5 keV energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding to
a fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 GRBs yr^-1 sr^-1 at
z>5 (~3 GRBs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z>10). Once high-z GRBs are detected the principal

with a significance of 24{\sigma} in 0.2-300 GeV, projected to lie to the
northwest of the thermal composite SNR Kesteven 41, using 5.6 years of
Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation data. No significant long-term
variability in the energy range 0.2--300 GeV is detected around this source.
The 3{\sigma} error circle, 0.09 degree; in radius, covers the 1720MHz OH maser
and is essentially consistent with the location of the V_{LSR} ~-50 km/s MC
with which the SNR interacts. The source emission has an exponential cutoff
power-law spectrum with a photon index of 1.9+/-0.1 and a cutoff energy of
4.0+/-0.9 GeV, and the corresponding 0.2-300 GeV luminosity is ~1.3*10^36 erg/s
at a distance of 12 kpc. There is no radio pulsar in the 3{\sigma} circle
responsible for the high {\gamma}-ray luminosity. While the inverse Compton

the source emission can naturally be explained by the hadronic interaction
between the relativistic protons accelerated by the shock of SNR Kesteven 41
and the adjacent northwestern MC. In this paper, we present a list of Galactic

total stellar mass (M_star) of galaxies is a fundamental relationship
indicating how they formed their stellar populations. To attempt to understand
this relation, we hypothesize that the relation and its evolution is regulated
by the increase in the stellar and gas mass surface density in galaxies with
redshift, which is itself governed by the angular momentum of the accreted gas,
the amount of available gas, and by self-regulation of star formation. With our
model, we can reproduce the specific SFR-M_star relations at z~1-2 by assuming
gas fractions and gas mass surface densities similar to those observed for
z=1-2 galaxies. We further argue that it is the increasing angular momentum
with cosmic time that causes a decrease in the surface density of accreted gas.
The gas mass surface densities in galaxies are controlled by the centrifugal
support (i.e., angular momentum), and the sSFR is predicted to increase as,
sSFR(z)=(1+z)^3/t_H0, as observed (where t_H0 is the Hubble time and no free
parameters are necessary). At z>~2, we argue that star formation is
self-regulated by high pressures generated by the intense star formation
itself. The star formation intensity must be high enough to either balance the
hydrostatic pressure (a rather extreme assumption) or to generate high
turbulent pressure in the molecular medium which maintains galaxies near the
line of instability (i.e. Toomre Q~1). The most important factor is the
increase in stellar and gas mass surface density with redshift, which allows
distant galaxies to maintain high levels of sSFR. Without a strong feedback
from massive stars, such galaxies would likely reach very high sSFR levels,
have high star formation efficiencies, and because strong feedback drives
outflows, ultimately have an excess of stellar baryons (abridged).

semiclassical black hole evaporation to the two established models. In
particular, we study the density matrix of the outgoing radiation and determine
how the magnitude of the off-diagonal corrections differs for the three

correct to all orders in perturbation theory and also allows one to express the
full density matrix in terms of the single-particle density matrix. We then
consider the semiclassical theory for which the corrections, being
non-perturbative from an effective field-theory perspective, are much less
suppressed and grow monotonically in time. In this case, the R\'enyi entropy
for the outgoing radiation is shown to grow linearly at early times; but this
growth slows down and the entropy eventually starts to decrease at the Page

cosmic web into four distinct components (voids, sheets, filaments, and

automatically and self-consistently propagates typical observational

Upsilon, and J/psi decays into electron-positron pairs. The spectra of the
observables relevant to electron reconstruction and selection as well as their
global efficiencies are well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The
momentum scale is calibrated with an uncertainty smaller than 0.3%. The
momentum resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays ranges from 1.7 to
4.5%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through
bremsstrahlung in the detector material.

a renormalisation condition in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. This

Lagrangean should agree. We develop a proof of the validity of this principle
in the case of scalar fields and quadratic interactions without derivatives
which differs in strategy from the one given by Hollands & Wald for the case of
quadratic interactions encoding a change of metric. Thereby we profit from the
observation that, in the case of quadratic interactions, the composition of the
inverse classical M{\o}ller map and the quantum M{\o}ller map is a contraction
exponential of a particular type. Afterwards, we prove a generalisation of the
Principle of Perturbative Agreement and show that considering an arbitrary
quadratic contribution of a general interaction either as part of the free
theory or as part of the perturbation gives equivalent results. Motivated by
the thermal mass idea, we use our findings in order to extend the construction
of massive interacting thermal equilibrium states in Minkowski spacetime
developed by Fredenhagen & Lindner to the massless case. In passing, we also
prove a property of the construction of Fredenhagen & Lindner which was

Gumbel extreme value distribution, are widely applied for extreme value
analysis. The Gumbel distribution has certain drawbacks because it is a
non-heavy-tailed distribution and is characterized by constant skewness and
kurtosis. The generalized extreme value distribution is frequently used in this
context because it encompasses the three possible limiting distributions for a
normalized maximum of infinite samples of independent and identically
distributed observations. However, the generalized extreme value distribution
might not be a suitable model when each observed maximum does not come from a
large number of observations. Hence, other forms of generalizations of the
Gumbel distribution might be preferable. Our goal is to collect in the present
literature the distributions that contain the Gumbel distribution embedded in
them and to identify those that have flexible skewness and kurtosis, are
heavy-tailed and could be competitive with the generalized extreme value
distribution. The generalizations of the Gumbel distribution are described and
compared using an application to a wind speed data set and Monte Carlo
simulations. We show that some distributions suffer from overparameterization
and coincide with other generalized Gumbel distributions with a smaller number
of parameters, i.e., are non-identifiable. Our study suggests that the
generalized extreme value distribution and a mixture of two extreme value
distributions should be considered in practical applications.

relevant for vibro-impacting dynamics, where impact events constitute the
primary source of randomness. Such systems are characterised by the existence
of switching manifolds that divide the phase space into regions where the
system is smooth. The initiation of impacts is captured by a grazing
bifurcation, at which a periodic orbit describing motion without impacts
develops a tangential intersection with a switching manifold. Oscillatory
dynamics near regular grazing bifurcations are described by piecewise-smooth
maps involving a square-root singularity, known as Nordmark maps. We consider
three scenarios where coloured noise only affects impacting dynamics, and
derive three two-dimensional stochastic Nordmark maps with the noise appearing
in different nonlinear or multiplicative ways, depending on the source of the
noise. Consequently the stochastic dynamics differs between the three noise
sources, and is fundamentally different to that of a Nordmark map with additive

concurrent processes to execute sequences of shared-data accesses
(transactions) speculatively, with an option of aborting them in the future.
Early TM designs avoided using locks and relied on non-blocking synchronization
to ensure obstruction-freedom: a transaction that encounters no step contention
is not allowed to abort. However, it was later observed that obstruction-free
TMs perform poorly and, as a result, state-of-the-art TM implementations are
nowadays blocking, allowing aborts because of data conflicts rather than step
contention.
  In this paper, we explain this shift in the TM practice theoretically, via
complexity bounds. We prove a few important lower bounds on obstruction-free
TMs. Then we present a lock-based TM implementation that beats all of these
lower bounds. In sum, our results exhibit a considerable complexity gap between
non-blocking and blocking TM implementations.

heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and more
recently at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These new data, in combination
with theoretical advances from calculations made in a variety of frameworks,
have led to a broad and deep knowledge of the properties of thermal QCD matter.
Increasingly quantitative descriptions of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created
in these collisions have established that the QGP is a strongly coupled liquid
with the lowest value of specific viscosity ever measured. However, much
remains to be learned about the precise nature of the initial state from which
this liquid forms, how its properties vary across its phase diagram and how, at
a microscopic level, the collective properties of this liquid emerge from the
interactions among the individual quarks and gluons that must be visible if the
liquid is probed with sufficiently high resolution. This white paper, prepared

early Universe, carrying both cosmological and astrophysical information from a
wide range of redshifts. In particular, the power spectrum of fluctuations in
the 21-cm brightness temperature is anisotropic due to the line-of-sight
velocity gradient, which in principle allows for a simple extraction of this
information in the limit of linear fluctuations. However, recent numerical
studies suggest that the 21-cm signal is actually rather complex, and its
analysis likely depends on detailed model fitting. We present the first
realistic simulation of the anisotropic 21-cm power spectrum over a wide period
of early cosmic history. We show that on observable scales, the anisotropy is
large and thus measurable at most redshifts, and its form tracks the evolution
of 21-cm fluctuations as they are produced early on by Lyman-a radiation from
stars, then switch to X-ray radiation from early heating sources, and finally
to ionizing radiation from stars. In particular, we predict a redshift window
during cosmic heating (at z ~ 15), when the anisotropy is small, during which
the shape of the 21-cm power spectrum on large scales is determined directly by
the average radial distribution of the flux from X-ray sources. This makes
possible a model-independent reconstruction of the X-ray spectrum of the
earliest sources of cosmic heating.

While
there has been significant research on this problem, current state-of-the-art

models to fully capture faces in all orientations, e.g. 22 models in HeadHunter
method [22]. In this paper we propose Deep Dense Face Detector (DDFD), a method
that does not require pose/landmark annotation and is able to detect faces in a
wide range of orientations using a single model based on deep convolutional
neural networks. The proposed method has minimal complexity; unlike other
recent deep learning object detection methods [9], it does not require
additional components such as segmentation, bounding-box regression, or SVM
classifiers. Furthermore, we analyzed scores of the proposed face detector for
faces in different orientations and found that 1) the proposed method is able
to detect faces from different angles and can handle occlusion to some extent,
2) there seems to be a correlation between dis- tribution of positive examples
in the training set and scores of the proposed face detector. The latter
suggests that the proposed methods performance can be further improved by using
better sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques.
Evaluations on popular face detection benchmark datasets show that our
single-model face detector algorithm has similar or better performance compared
to the previous methods, which are more complex and require annotations of

yet the emergence of consistent phenomena across a diverse range of ecological
systems suggests that many patterns may in part be determined by statistical or
numerical constraints. Differentiating the extent to which patterns in a given
system are determined statistically, and where it requires explicit ecological
processes, has been difficult. We tackled this challenge by directly comparing
models from a constraint-based theory, the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology
(METE) and models from a process-based theory, the size-structured neutral
theory (SSNT). Models from both theories were capable of characterizing the
distribution of individuals among species and the distribution of body size
among individuals across 76 forest communities. However, the SSNT models
consistently yielded higher overall likelihood, as well as more realistic
characterizations of the relationship between species abundance and average
body size of conspecific individuals. This suggests that the details of the
biological processes contain additional information for understanding community
structure that are not fully captured by the METE constraints in these systems.
Our approach provides a first step towards differentiating between process- and

$T_{N}$, weak ferromagnetism due to spin canting is observed. The canting is
caused by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with an estimated $bc$-plane

decelerating spherical shocks, the volume integrated spectra of both electrons
and radiation deviate significantly from the test-particle power-laws predicted
for constant planar shocks, because the shock compression ratio and the flux of
injected electrons decrease in time. In this study, we consider spherical blast
waves propagating into a constant density core surrounded by an isothermal halo
with a decreasing density profile in order to explore how the deceleration rate
of the shock speed affects the radio emission from accelerated electrons. The
surface brightness profile and the volume-integrated radio spectrum of the
model shocks are calculated by assuming a ribbon-like shock surface on a
spherical shell and the associated downstream region of relativistic electrons.
If the postshock magnetic field strength is about 7 microgauss, at the shock
age of ~50 Myr, the volume-integrated radio spectrum steepens gradually with
the spectral index from alpha_{inj} to alpha_{inj}+0.5 over 0.1-10 GHz, where
alpha_{inj} is the injection index at the shock positionexpected from the
diffusive shock acceleration theory. Such gradual steepening could explain the
curved radio spectrum of the radio relic in cluster A2266, which was
interpreted as a broken power-law by Trasatti et al. (2014), if the relic shock
is young enough so that the break frequency falls in around 1 GHz.

~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred
throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this
time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European
hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and
Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded
Ware people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya,
documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern
periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans
until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans.

features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However,
as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the
network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with
increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the
dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this
paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which
generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation
scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are
embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of
different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain
discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method
for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with
statistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel
embedding. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture
yields state-of-the-art image classification error rates on standard domain
adaptation benchmarks.

authentication which is based on Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) and grouped

the least significant bit(LSB) plane of the host image using the adaptive
chaotic map to determine the positions. The groped blocks break the block-wise
independence and therefore can withstand the Vector Quantization attack(VQ
attack). The inserting positions are related to the statistical information of
image block data, in order to increase the security and provide an auxiliary
way to authenticate the image data. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is
checked by a variety of attacks, and the experimental results prove that it has
a remarkable tamper detection ability and also has a precise locating ability.

highly challenging from both the theoretical and engineering perspectives. This
can be overcome by introducing a minuscule amount of long flexible polymers,
resulting in a chaotic flow dubbed \textit{elastic turbulence}. At the basis of
the theoretical frameworks for its study lie the assumptions of a spatially
smooth and random-in-time velocity field. Previous measurements of elastic
turbulence have been limited to two-dimensions. Using a novel three-dimensional

explore elastic turbulence from the perspective of particles moving with the

smaller than a tenth of the system size. Moreover, we provide conclusive
experimental evidence that \textit{ballistic} separation prevails in the
dynamics of pairs of tracers over long times and distances, exhibiting a memory
of the initial separation velocities. The ballistic dispersion is universal,

object. Since its introduction, the CCD has been the principle method of
measuring flux to calculate the apparent magnitude of an object. Each CCD image
taken must go through a process of cleaning and calibration prior to its use.
As the number of research telescopes increases the overall computing resources
required for image processing also increases. Existing processing techniques
are primarily sequential in nature, requiring increasingly powerful servers,
faster disks and faster networks to process data. Existing High Performance
Computing solutions involving high capacity data centres are complex in design
and expensive to maintain, while providing resources primarily to high profile
science projects. This research describes three distributed pipeline
architectures, a virtualised cloud based IRAF, the Astronomical Compute Node
(ACN), a private cloud based pipeline, and NIMBUS, a globally distributed
system. The ACN pipeline processed data at a rate of 4 Terabytes per day
demonstrating data compression and upload to a central cloud storage service at
a rate faster than data generation. The primary contribution of this research
is NIMBUS, which is rapidly scalable, resilient to failure and capable of
processing CCD image data at a rate of hundreds of Terabytes per day. This
pipeline is implemented using a decentralised web queue to control the
compression of data, uploading of data to distributed web servers, and creating
web messages to identify the location of the data. Using distributed web queue
messages, images are downloaded by computing resources distributed around the
globe. Rigorous experimental evidence is presented verifying the horizontal
scalability of the system which has demonstrated a processing rate of 192
Terabytes per day with clear indications that higher processing rates are
possible.

Firstly, the disorder averaged wave function and current are asymptotically

of adiabatic motion. Secondly, after a short transition period the pumped
electric charge exhibits fluctuations that grow much faster than predicted by
the adiabatic theory. We also derive the exact expressions for the average

from Inverse-Compton scattering of relativistic electrons accelerated by plasma
turbulence, and the microwaves are radiated by synchrotron radiation. But no
previous research reproduces both the Fermi Bubbles and WMAP haze under typical
magnetic fields in the galaxy. We assume that shocks present in the bubbles and
the efficiency of the acceleration by plasma turbulence, 'stochastic
acceleration', changes with the distance from the shock front. The distance
from the shock front increases with time, accordingly the efficiency of the
acceleration changes with time. We also consider the time development of the

exciting hypothesis much more in depth than previous analyses. In particular,
we take into account all requirements for singularity avoidance, while
previously only a subset of these requirements had been considered. Moreover,
we show that the implications of a rainbow metric for thermodynamics are more

particularly meaningful examples of rainbow metrics we find that our concerns
are not merely important conceptually, but actually change in quantitatively
significant manner the outcome of the analysis. Notably we only find examples
where the singularity is not avoided, though one can have that in the regime
where our semi-classical picture is still reliable the approach to the
singularity is slowed down when compared to the standard classical scenario. We
conclude that the study of rainbow metrics provides tantalizing hints of
singularity avoidance but is inconclusive, since some key questions remain to
be addressed just when the scale factor is very small, a regime which, as here
argued, cannot be reliably described by an effective rainbow-metric picture.

  Decision Processes",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While for deterministic systems, a counterexample to a property can simply be
an error trace, counterexamples in probabilistic systems are necessarily more
complex. For instance, a set of erroneous traces with a sufficient cumulative
probability mass can be used. Since these are too large objects to understand
and manipulate, compact representations such as subchains have been considered.
In the case of probabilistic systems with non-determinism, the situation is
even more complex. While a subchain for a given strategy (or scheduler,
resolving non-determinism) is a straightforward choice, we take a different
approach. Instead, we focus on the strategy - which can be a counterexample to
violation of or a witness of satisfaction of a property - itself, and extract
the most important decisions it makes, and present its succinct representation.
The key tools we employ to achieve this are (1) introducing a concept of
importance of a state w.r.t. the strategy, and (2) learning using decision
trees. There are three main consequent advantages of our approach. Firstly, it
exploits the quantitative information on states, stressing the more important
decisions. Secondly, it leads to a greater variability and degree of freedom in
representing the strategies. Thirdly, the representation uses a
self-explanatory data structure. In summary, our approach produces more
succinct and more explainable strategies, as opposed to e.g. binary decision
diagrams. Finally, our experimental results show that we can extract several
rules describing the strategy even for very large systems that do not fit in

Comparisons between experiment and quantum electrodynamics calculations for

dimensions, under which conditions gravity will become much stronger. Molecules
are a probe of space-time geometry at typical distances where chemical bonds
are effective, i.e. at length scales of an \AA. Constraints on compactification
radii for extra dimensions are derived within the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali

composition is continuous, increasing and upper bounded by the identity
function. In this work, an alternative sufficient condition is presented for
the case in which this criterion fails due to either lack of continuity or the
bound of the composed gain is larger than the identity function. More
precisely, the local (resp. non-local) asymptotic stability of the origin
(resp. global attractivity of a compact set) is ensured by a region-dependent
small gain condition. Under an additional condition that implies convergence of
solutions for almost all initial conditions in a suitable domain, the almost
global asymptotic stability of the origin is ensured. Two examples illustrate
and motivate this approach.

This work analyzes a clustered infrastructure of dedicated hardware nodes to

To make meaningful mapping decisions, the global management nodes employ a
workload status communication mechanism.
  This paper discusses the design-space of the dedicated infrastructure by
means of task mapping use-cases and a parallel benchmark including
application-interference. We evaluate the architecture in terms of application

explain the empirical findings. It turns out that in the most cases, a nucleus
for empirical spontaneous traffic breakdown occurs through an interaction of
one of waves in free flow with an empirical permanent speed disturbance
localized at a highway bottleneck. The wave is a localized structure in free
flow, in which the total flow rate is larger and the speed averaged across the
highway is smaller than outside the wave. The waves in free flow appear due to
oscilations in the percentage of slow vehicles; these waves propagate with the
average speed of slow vehicles in free flow (about 85--88 km/h for German
highways). Any of the waves exhibits a two-dimensional asymmetric
spatiotemporal structure: Wave's characteristics are different in different

commission no greater than the half bid-ask spread. Throughout the entire
period, the main concern is inventory risk, which increases as the number of
held positions becomes critically small or large. The dark pool can control its
inventory by choosing the size of the commission for each transaction, so to
encourage, e.g., buy orders instead of sell orders. Furthermore, it can submit
lit-pool limit orders, of which execution is uncertain, and market orders,
which are expensive. In either case, the dark pool risks an information
leakage, which we model via a fixed penalty for trading in the lit pool. We
solve a double-obstacle impulse-control problem associated with the optimal

levels, an intensional one, called mTT and an extensional one, called emTT,
based on versions of Martin-L\""of's type theory. Thanks to the link between the
two levels, it is enough to build a semantics for the intensional level to get
one also for the extensional level. Hence here we just build a realizability
semantics for the intensional level mTT. Such a semantics is a modification of
the realizability semantics in Beeson 1985 for extensional first order
Martin-L\""of's type theory with one universe. So it is formalised in Feferman's
classical arithmetic theory of inductive definitions. It is called extensional
Kleene realizability semantics since it validates extensional equality of
type-theoretic functions extFun, as in Beeson 1985. The main modification we
perform on Beeson's semantics is to interpret propositions, which are defined
primitively in MF, in a proof-irrelevant way. As a consequence, we gain the
validity of CT. Recalling that extFun+ CT+ AC are inconsistent over arithmetics
with finite types, we conclude that our semantics does not validate the full
Axiom of Choice AC. On the contrary, Beeson's semantics does validate AC, being
this a theorem of Martin-L\""of's theory, but it does not validate CT. The
semantics we present here appears to be the best Kleene realizability semantics
for the extensional level emTT of MF. Indeed Beeson's semantics is not an
option for emTT since the full AC added to it entails the excluded middle.

dark matter annihilation or decay, may contribute as well. In this review, we

analysing galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and the stellar mass
function. We interpret our measurements within the halo occupation distribution
(HOD) framework, separating the contributions from central and satellite
galaxies. We find that the SHMR for the central galaxies peaks at $M_{\rm h,

which decreases to $\sim0.001$ for massive halos ($M_{\rm h} > 10^{14}

satellites) is boosted by a factor 10 in the high-mass regime (cluster-size
halos), a result consistent with cluster analyses from the literature based on
fully independent methods. After properly accounting for differences in
modelling, we have compared our results with a large number of results from the
literature up to $z=1$: we find good general agreement, independently of the

intermediate mass (${M}_{\star} < 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) and the statistical

of the drop and the pool deform before the drop touches the pool. The build up
of air pressure prior to coalescence is responsible for this deformation. Due
to this deformation, air can be entrained at the bottom of the drop during the
impact. We quantify the amount of entrained air numerically, using the Boundary
Integral Method (BIM) for potential flow for the drop and the pool, coupled to
viscous lubrication theory for the air film that has to be squeezed out during
impact. We compare our results to various experimental data and find excellent
agreement for the amount of air that is entrapped during impact onto a pool.
Next, the impact of a rigid sphere onto a pool is numerically investigated and
the air that is entrapped in this case also matches with available experimental
data. In both cases of drop and sphere impact onto a pool the numerical air
bubble volume V_b is found to be in agreement with the theoretical scaling
V_b/V_{drop/sphere} ~ St^{-4/3}, where St is the Stokes number. This is the
same scaling that has been found for drop impact onto a solid surface in
previous research. This implies a universal mechanism for air entrainment for
these different impact scenarios, which has been suggested in recent
experimental work, but is now further elucidated with numerical results.

Phenomenologically, the torques have field-like and antidamping-like components

possible origins. In one picture, a spin-current generated in the paramagnet
via the relativistic spin Hall effect (SHE) is absorbed in the ferromagnet and
induces the spin transfer torque (STT). In the other picture, a non-equilibrium
spin-density is generated via the relativistic inverse spin galvanic effect
(ISGE) and induces the spin-orbit torque (SOT) in the ferromagnet. From the
early observations in paramagnetic semiconductors, SHE and ISGE are known as
companion phenomena that can both allow for electrically aligning spins in the
same structure. It is essential for our basic physical understanding of the
spin torques at the ferromagnet/paramagnet interface to experimentally
disentangle the SHE and ISGE contributions. To achieve this we prepared an

encoded in the elastic form factors. These have been precisely measured in
elastic electron scattering, and the combination of proton and neutron form
factors allows for the separation of the up- and down-quark contributions. In
this work, we extract the proton and neutron form factors from world's data
with an emphasis on precise new data covering the low-momentum region, which is
sensitive to the large-scale structure of the nucleon. From these, we separate
the up- and down-quark contributions to the proton form factors. We combine
cross section and polarization measurements of elastic electron-proton
scattering to separate the proton form factors and two-photon exchange (TPE)
contributions. We combine the proton form factors with parameterization of the
neutron form factor data and uncertainties to separate the up- and down-quark
contributions to the proton's charge and magnetic form factors. The extracted
TPE corrections are compared to previous phenomenological extractions, TPE
calculations, and direct measurements from the comparison of electron and
positron scattering. The flavor-separated form factors are extracted and
compared to models of the nucleon structure. With the inclusion of the precise
new data, the extracted TPE contributions show a clear change ofsign at low
$Q^2$, necessary to explain the high-$Q^2$ form factor discrepancy while being
consistent with the known $Q^2 \to 0$ limit. We find that the new Mainz data
yield a significantly different result for the proton magnetic form factor and
its flavor-separated contributions. We also observe that the RMS radius of both
the up- and down-quark distributions are smaller than the RMS charge radius of
the proton.

operations on the sensing matrix, what are the changes of its spark, NSP order

three quantitative indexes of sensing matrices all possess invariance under all
matrix elementary transformations except column-addition ones. Putting this
result in form of matrix products, we get the types of matrices which multiply
a sensing matrix and make the products still have the same properties of sparse
recovery as the sensing matrix. According to these types of matrices, we made
an interesting discovery that sensing matrices with deterministic constructions
do not possess the property universality which belongs to sensing matrices with
random constructions.

in the accretion disc. Outflows may probably be driven from the disc if the
radiation flux of the disc is greater than a critical value corresponding to
the maximal vertical gravity. We find that outflows are driven by the radiation
force from the disc if the accretion rate is greater than the Eddington rate.
The radiation of the disc is therefore limited by such outflows. The disc
luminosity, L=L_Edd\propto ln mdot, at large-mdot cases. The Eddington ratio of
the disc is ~3 for mdot~100, which is significantly lower than that of a
conventional slim disc without outflows. This implies that the emission from
some ultra-luminous X-ray sources with highly super Eddington luminosity should
be Doppler beamed, or intermediate mass black holes are in these sources
instead of stellar mass black holes. The spectra of the discs with outflows are
saturated in the high frequency end provided mdot>2. We suggest that the
saturated emission can be observed to estimate the masses of the black holes
accreting at high rates, such as the narrow-line Seyfert galaxies, with the
model calculations. The rate of the mass accreted by the black hole is always
around the Eddington rate even if the mass accretion rate at the outer radius
is very high, because most of the gas is removed into the outflows. This
implies that the luminous quasars at high redshifts z>6 should have grown up
through persistent accretion at a rate close to the Eddington rate.

highest throughput possible. While such multiple-unicast models are unsolved in
general, several network coding based schemes were suggested. In such schemes,
the transmitter can either send an uncoded packet, or a coded packet which is a
function of a few packets. The packets sent can be received by the designated
receiver (with some probability) or heard and stored by other receivers. Two
functional modes are considered; the first presumes that the storage time is
unlimited, while in the second it is limited by a given Time to Expire (TTE)
parameter. We model the transmission process as an infinite-horizon Markov
Decision Process (MDP). Since the large state space renders exact solutions
computationally impractical, we introduce policy restricted and induced MDPs
with significantly reduced state space, and prove that with proper reward
function they have equal optimal value function (hence equal optimal
throughput). We then derive a reinforcement learning algorithm, which learns
the optimal policy for the induced MDP. This optimal strategy of the induced
MDP, once applied to the policy restricted one, significantly improves over
uncoded schemes. Next, we enhance the algorithm by means of analysis of the
structural properties of the resulting reward functional. We demonstrate that
our method scales well in the number of users, and automatically adapts to the
packet loss rates, unknown in advance. In addition, the performance is compared
to the recent bound by Wang, which assumes much stronger coding (e.g.,
intra-session and buffering of coded packets), yet is shown to be comparable.

first-order, QPT from the ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic one as a
function of some control parameter, as predicted by theory. Disordered systems
are much more complicated, depending on the disorder strength and the distance
from the QPT. In many disordered materials the QPT is continuous, or second
order, and Griffiths-phase effects coexist with QPT singularities near the
transition. In other systems the transition from the ferromagnetic state at low
temperatures is to a different type of long-range order, such as an
antiferromagnetic or a spin-density-wave state. In still other materials a
transition to a state with glass-like spin dynamics is suspected. The review
provides a comprehensive discussion of the current understanding of these
various transitions, and of the relation between experimental and theoretical

June to October 2013 which widely improves our knowledge of its spectral energy
distribution. This campaign involved the NuSTAR satellite (3-79 keV), the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT, 100~MeV-300~GeV) and the High Energy Stereoscopic
System (H.E.S.S.) array phase II (with an energy threshold of few tens of GeV).
While the observations with NuSTAR extend the X-ray spectrum to higher energies
than before, H.E.S.S. phase II, together with the use of the LAT PASS 8,
enhance the coverage of the $\gamma$-ray regime with an unprecedented
precision. In this work, preliminary results from the multi-wavelength analysis
are presented.

of multi-component disc galaxies similar to the Milky Way. We define
distribution functions for the stellar disc and dark halo that depend on phase
space position only through action coordinates. We then use an iterative
approach to find the corresponding gravitational potential. We study the
adiabatic response of the initially spherical dark halo to the introduction of
the baryonic component and find that the halo flattens in its inner regions
with final minor-major axis ratios $q$ = 0.75 - 0.95. The extent of the
flattening depends on the velocity structure of the halo particles with
radially biased models exhibiting a stronger response. In this latter case,
which is according to cosmological simulations the most likely one, the new
density structure resembles a ""dark disc"" superimposed on a spherical halo. We
discuss the implications of these results for our recent estimate of the local
dark matter density. The velocity distribution of the dark-matter particles
near the Sun is very non-Gaussian. All three principal velocity dispersions are
boosted as the halo contracts, and at low velocities a plateau develops in the
distribution of $v_z$. For models similar to a state-of-the-art Galaxy model we
find velocity dispersions around 155 km s$^{-1}$ for $v_z$ and the tangential
velocity, $v_\varphi$, and 140 - 175 km s$^{-1}$ for the in-plane radial
velocity, $v_R$, depending on the anisotropy of the model.

significant increase in the nematic susceptibility as approaching the

small lattice effects and, in the absence of magnetic fluctuations above the

indistinguishable photons on a three port device providing a generalisation of
the well known Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two indistinguishable photons on
a two port device. Our analysis is based on the underlying mathematical
framework of SU(3) transformations rather than SU(2) transformations. We show
the completely destructive three photon interference for a large range of
parameters of the three port device and point out the physical origin of such
interference in terms of the contributions from different quantum paths. As
each output port can deliver zero to three photons the device generates higher
dimensional entanglement. In particular, different forms of entangled states of
qudits can be generated depending on the device parameters. Our system is
different from a symmetric three port beam splitter which does not exhibit a
three photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.

$X_b\to \Upsilon(1S)\omega$, where $X_b$ is taken to be the counterpart of the
famous $X(3872)$ in the bottomonium sector as a candidate for the meson-meson
molecule. Since it is likely that the $X_b$ is below the $B\bar B^*$ threshold
and the mass difference between the neutral and charged bottom meson is small
compared to the binding energy of the $X_b$, the isospin violating decay mode
$X_b\to \Upsilon (nS)\pi^+\pi^-$ would be greatly suppressed. We use the
effective Lagrangian based on the heavy quark symmetry to explore the
rescattering mechanism of $X_b\to \Upsilon(1S)\omega$ and calculate the partial
widths. Our results show that the partial width for the $X_b\to
\Upsilon(1S)\omega$ is about tens of keVs. Taking into account the fact that
the total width of $X_b$ may be smaller than a few MeV like $X(3872)$, the
calculated branching ratios may reach to orders of $10^{-2}$. These hidden
bottomonium decay modes are of great importance in the experimental search for
the $X_b$ particularly at the hadron collider. Also, the associated studies of
hidden bottomonium decays $X_b \to \Upsilon(nS) \gamma$, $\Upsilon(nS)\omega$,
and $B\bar B \gamma$ may help us investigate the structure of $X_b$ deeply. The
experimental observation of $X_b$ will provide us with further insight into the
spectroscopy of exotic states and is helpful to probe the structure of the
states connected by the heavy quark symmetry.

formation of planets and the delivery of water onto these planets is a key
question as water is essential for the development of life. In the first part
of the paper we summarize the state of the art of planet formation - which is
still under debate in the astronomical community - before we show our results
on this topic. The outcome of our numerical simulations depends a lot on the
choice of the initial distribution of planetesimals and planetary embryos after
gas disappeared in the protoplanetary disk. We also take into account that some
of these planetesimals of sizes in the order of the mass of the Moon already
contained water; the quantity depends on the distance from the Sun - close-by
bodies are dry, but starting from a distance of about 2 AU they can contain
substantial amounts of water. We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial
planets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies
containing water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets.
We thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the
actual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on
the surface of Earth. In the second part we discuss in more detail how the
formation of larger bodies after a collision may happen as the outcome depends
on parameters like collision velocity, impact angle, and the materials
involved. We present results obtained by SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics)
simulations. We briefly describe this method and show different scenarios with
respect to the formed bodies, possible fragmentation and the water content
before and after the collision. In an appendix we discuss detection methods for
extrasolar planets (close to 2000 such objects have been discovered so far).

about optimized reactive systems. Reasoning about reactive systems using
refinement involves defining an abstract, high-level specification system and a
concrete, low-level implementation system. One then shows that every behavior
allowed by the implementation is also allowed by the specification. Due to the
difference in abstraction levels, it is often the case that the implementation
requires many steps to match one step of the specification, hence, it is quite
useful for refinement to directly account for stuttering. Some optimized
implementations, however, can actually take multiple specification steps at
once. For example, a memory controller can buffer the commands to the memory
and at a later time simultaneously update multiple memory locations, thereby
skipping several observable states of the abstract specification, which only
updates one memory location at a time. We introduce skipping simulation
refinement and provide a sound and complete characterization consisting of
""local"" proof rules that are amenable to mechanization and automated
verification. We present case studies that highlight the applicability of
skipping refinement: a JVM-inspired stack machine, a simple memory controller
and a scalar to vector compiler transformation. Our experimental results
demonstrate that current model-checking and automated theorem proving tools
have difficultly automatically analyzing these systems using existing notions
of correctness, but they can analyze the systems if we use skipping refinement.

long time, are losing grounds to Hybrid TV's, PC's, game consoles, and, more
recently, mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. The new predominant
paradigm is: watch what I want, when I want, and where I want.
  The challenges of this shift are manifold. On the one hand, broadcast
technologies such as DVB-T/C/S need to be extended or replaced by mechanisms
supporting asynchronous viewing, such as IPTV and video streaming over
best-effort networks, while remaining scalable to millions of users. On the
other hand, the dramatic increase of wireless data traffic begins to stretch
the capabilities of the existing wireless infrastructure to its limits.
Finally, there is a challenge to video streaming technologies to cope with a
high heterogeneity of end-user devices and dynamically changing network
conditions, in particular in wireless and mobile networks.
  In the present work, our goal is to design an efficient system that supports
a high number of unicast streaming sessions in a dense wireless access network.
We address this goal by jointly considering the two problems of wireless
transmission scheduling and video quality adaptation, using techniques inspired
by the robustness and simplicity of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controllers. We show that the control-theoretic approach allows to efficiently
utilize available wireless resources, providing high Quality of Experience

distribution model was therefore run to give the best fit to the observational
rotation curves for 37 representative galaxies. The resultant curves closely
matched the observational data for a wide range of velocity profiles and galaxy
types with rising, flat or descending curves in agreement with Verheijen's
classification of 'R', 'F' and 'D' type curves, and the corresponding
theoretical total disk masses could be fitted to a baryonic Tully Fisher
relation (bTFR). Nine of the galaxies were matched to galaxies with previously
published masses, suggesting a mean excess dynamic disk mass of dex0.61+/-0.26

to the fluid layer, a checkerboard crystal forms; when the angle between the
field and the normal is sufficiently large, a striped crystal assembles. As the
field is slowly tilted away from the normal, we find that the transformation
pathway between the two phases depends strongly on crystal orientation, field
strength, and degree of confinement of the monolayer. In some cases, the
pathway occurs by smooth magnetostrictive shear, while in others it involves
the sudden formation of martensitic plates.

This geometry causes the resulting $N-1$ coupled non-linear ordinary
differential equations for the $N-1$ monopole profiles to become autonomous.
One can also define a flat limit in which the curvature of the background
metric is arbitrarily small but the simplifications brought in by the geometry
remain. We prove analytically that non-trivial solutions in which the profiles
are not proportional can be found. Moreover, we construct numerical solutions
for $N=2,3$ and 4. The presence of the parameter $N$ allows one to take a
smooth large $N$ limit which greatly simplifies the treatment of the infinite
number of profile function equations. We show that, in this limit, the system
of infinitely many coupled ordinary differential equations for the monopole
profiles reduces to a single two-dimensional non-linear partial differential
equation.

this work, we statistically investigate 78 solar proton events of 1996-2011 and
find that there exists a longitudinally asymmetric distribution of flare
sources of the solar proton events observed near 1 AU, namely, with the same
longitude separation between magnetic field line footpoint of observer and
flare sources, the number of the solar proton events originating from sources
located at eastern side of the nominal magnetic footpoint of observer is much
larger than that of the solar proton events originating from sources located at
western side. A complete model calculation of solar energetic particle (SEP)
propagation in the three-dimensional Parker interplanetary magnetic field is
presented to give a numerical explanation for this longitudinally asymmetric
distribution phenomenon. We find that the longitudinally asymmetric
distribution of solar proton events results from the east-west azimuthal
asymmetry in the topology of the Parker interplanetary magnetic field as well
as the effects of perpendicular diffusion on the transport of SEPs in the
heliosphere. Our results would be valuable in understanding the
