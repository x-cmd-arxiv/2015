photochemical atmosphere models. Exoplanet searches have unveiled a large
population of short-period objects with hot atmospheres, very different from
what we find in our solar system. Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can
now be studied by transit spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and
have typical temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV
photolysis cross section data are severely lacking. Our goal is to provide
high-temperature absorption cross sections and their temperature dependency for
important atmospheric compounds. This study is dedicated to CO2, which is
observed and photodissociated in exoplanet atmospheres. We performed these
measurements for the 115 - 200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and 550 K. In the 195
- 230 nm range, we worked at seven temperatures between 465 and 800 K. We found
that the absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to temperature,
especially above 160 nm. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross
section can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,
makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230 nm,
while it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K. To investigate the influence of
these new data on the photochemistry of exoplanets, we implemented the measured
cross section into a 1D photochemical model. The model predicts that accounting
for this temperature dependency of CO2 cross section can affect the computed
abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by one order of magnitude in the atmospheres of
hot Jupiter and hot Neptune.

contributions to the vacuum energy from the DBI and WZ term cancel for a D3

The next step was taken in arXiv:1411.1121 where the analogous mechanism of the

discovered in the presence of Volkov-Akulov fermions living on the brane, in a

several reasoning services are developed in this context. Belief revision is
one of them, of prime importance when knowledge is prone to change and
inconsistency. In this paper we address both the generalization of the
well-known AGM postulates, and the definition of concrete and well-founded
revision operators in different DL families. We introduce a model-theoretic
version of the AGM postulates with a general definition of inconsistency, hence
enlarging their scope to a wide family of non-classical logics, in particular
negation-free DL families. We propose a general framework for defining revision
operators based on the notion of relaxation, introduced recently for defining
dissimilarity measures between DL concepts. A revision operator in this
framework amounts to relax the set of models of the old belief until it reaches
the sets of models of the new piece of knowledge. We demonstrate that such a
relaxation-based revision operator defines a faithful assignment and satisfies
the generalized AGM postulates. Another important contribution concerns the
definition of several concrete relaxation operators suited to the syntax of
some DLs (ALC and its fragments EL and ELU).

period of molecular vibration (8 fs), nonlinear reshaping of the pulse
envelope, accentuated by self-steepening and shock formation, creates an
ultrashort feature that causes impulsive excitation of long-lived coherent

impeded by the presence of walls than that of the latter. Once the large scales
are close to quasi-two dimensional, the decay results from the competition of a
two-dimensional dynamics driven by dissipation in the Hartmann boundary layers
and the three-dimensional dynamics of smaller scales. In the later stages of
the decay, three-dimensionality subsists under the form of barrel-shaped
structures. A purely quasi-two dimensional decay dominated by friction in the
Hartmann layers is not reached, because of residual dissipation in the bulk.
However, this dissipation is not generated by the three-dimensionality that
subsists, but by residual viscous friction due to horizontal velocity
gradients. Also, the energy in the velocity component aligned with the magnetic
field is found to be strongly suppressed, as is transport in this direction.
This results reproduces the experimental findings of Kolesnikov & Tsinober
(1974).

where the absence of an edge between two nodes $a$ and $b$ indicates that the
corresponding two variables $X_a$ and $X_b$ are believed to be conditionally
independent, after controlling for all other measured variables. In the
Gaussian case, conditional independence corresponds to a zero entry in the
precision matrix $\Omega$ (the inverse of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Real
data often exhibits heavy tail dependence between variables, which cannot be
captured by the commonly-used Gaussian or nonparanormal (Gaussian copula)
graphical models. In this paper, we study the transelliptical model, an
elliptical copula model that generalizes Gaussian and nonparanormal models to a
broader family of distributions. We propose the ROCKET method, which constructs
an estimator of $\Omega_{ab}$ that we prove to be asymptotically normal under
mild assumptions. Empirically, ROCKET outperforms the nonparanormal and
Gaussian models in terms of achieving accurate inference on simulated data. We
also compare the three methods on real data (daily stock returns), and find
that the ROCKET estimator is the only method whose behavior across subsamples
agrees with the distribution predicted by the theory.

finite correlated yield is observed at large relative pseudorapidity
($\Delta\eta$) on the near side (i.e. relative azimuth $\Delta\phi\sim0$). This
correlated yield as a function of $\Delta\eta$ appears to scale with the
dominant, primarily jet-related, away-side ($\Delta\phi\sim\pi$) yield. The
Fourier coefficients of the $\Delta\phi$ correlation, $V_{n}=\langle\cos

in the forward ($d$-going) and backward (Au-going) directions.

However, very little is known about the complexity of computing $\lambda_k(G)$.
Very recently, in the parameterized complexity community the notion of

background of high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) that would persist until
today. The nature of the inflaton's coupling to Standard Model or other fields
is unknown, so it is useful to ask what features such fields may typically
have, and how these affect predictions for the GW's produced. Here we consider
the inflaton to be coupled to a light scalar field, and show that even a very
small quartic self-interaction term will reduce the amplitude of the GW
spectrum. For self-coupling $\lambda_{\chi} \gtrsim g^2$, where $g^2$ is the
inflaton-scalar coupling, the peak energy density goes as $\Omega_{\rm
gw}^{(\lambda_{\chi})} / \Omega_{\rm gw}^{(\lambda_{\chi}=0)} \sim
(g^2/\lambda_{\chi})^{2}$. A consequence is that if the universe reheats
through an inflaton-Higgs coupling then the spectrum would be suppressed but
the dynamics would be sensitive to the Higgs potential near the energy scale of
inflation.

namely the detection of persistent, disk-resident malware. We exploit
normalised compression distance (NCD), an information theoretic measure,

we ask whether a suspect program is more similar to our malware or to our
benign-ware. Our approach classifies malware with 97.1% accuracy and a false
positive rate of 3%. We achieve our results with off-the-shelf compressors and
a standard machine learning classifier and without any specialised knowledge.
An end-user need only collect a zoo of malware and benign-ware and then can
immediately apply our techniques.
  We apply statistical rigour to our experiments and our selection of data. We
demonstrate that accuracy can be optimised by combining NCD with the
compressibility rates of the executables. We demonstrate that malware reported
within a more narrow time frame of a few days is more homogenous than malware
reported over a longer one of two years but that our method still classifies
the latter with 95.2% accuracy and a 5% false positive rate. Due to the use of
compression, the time and computation cost of our method is non-trivial. We
show that simple approximation techniques can improve the time complexity of
our approach by up to 63%.

programs used on the VirusTotal web site to our malware. Our approach does
better than any single one of them as well as the 59 used collectively.

transitions, are among the strongest discrete features in the X-ray band. These
are one of the most powerful probes to infer the properties of the plasma in
the innermost part of the accretion disk around a compact object. In this paper
we present a recent Suzaku observation, 100-ks effective exposure, of the atoll
source and X-ray burster 4U 1705-44, where we clearly detect signatures of a
reflection component which is distorted by the high-velocity motion in the
accretion disk. The reflection component consists of a broad iron line at about
6.4 keV and a Compton bump at high X-ray energies, around 20 keV. All these
features are consistently fitted with a reflection model, and we find that in
the hard state the smearing parameters are remarkably similar to those found in
a previous XMM-Newton observation performed in the soft state. In particular,
we find that the inner disk radius is Rin = 17 +/- 5 Rg (where Rg is the
Gravitational radius, GM/c^2), the emissivity dependence from the disk radius
is -2.5 +/- 0.5, the inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is i =
43 +/- 5 degrees, and the outer radius of the emitting region in the disk is
Rout > 200 Rg. We note that the accretion disk does not appear to be truncated
at large radii, although the source is in a hard state at about 3 % of the
Eddington luminosity for a neutron star. We also find evidence of a broad
emission line at low energies, at 3.03 +/- 0.03 keV, compatible with emission
from mildly ionized Argon (Ar XVI-XVII). Argon transitions are not included in
the self-consistent reflection models that we used and we therefore added an
extra component to our model to fit this feature. The low energy line appears
compatible with being smeared by the same inner disk parameters found for the
reflection component.

the array. The latter can also be viewed as the three permutations of a
hypermap. In particular, a map corresponds to a plane permutation, in which the
diagonal is a fixed point-free involution. We study the transposition action on
plane permutations obtained by permuting their diagonal-blocks. We establish
basic properties of plane permutations and study transpositions and exceedances
and derive various enumerative results. In particular, we prove a recurrence
for the number of plane permutations having a fixed diagonal and $k$ cycles in
the vertical, generalizing Chapuy's recursion for maps filtered by the genus.
As applications of this framework, we present a combinatorial proof of a result

product $\omega(1~2~\cdots ~n)$ has exactly $k$ cycles. Furthermore, we

permutations as well as the reversal distance of signed permutations. Plane
permutations allow us to generalize and recover various lower bounds for
transposition and block-interchange distances and to connect reversals with

radio-emitting phases (i.e. minutes to many hours), as well as considerable
nulling fractions (NFs) in the range $\sim67\,\% - 90\,\%$. PSR J1717$-$4054 is
also found to exhibit short timescale nulls ($1 - 40~P$) and burst phases
($\lesssim 200~P$) during its radio-emitting phases. This behaviour acts to
modulate the NF, and therefore the detection rate of the source, over
timescales of minutes. Furthermore, PSR J1853$+$0505 is shown to exhibit a weak
emission state, in addition to its strong and null states, after sufficient
pulse integration. This further indicates that nulls may often only represent
transitions to weaker emission states which are below the sensitivity
thresholds of particular observing systems. In addition, we detected a
peak-to-peak variation of $33\pm1\,\%$ in the spin-down rate of PSR
J1717$-$4054, over timescales of hundreds of days. However, no long-term
correlation with emission variation was found.

MFVB for exponential families defines a fixed-point equation in the means of
the approximating posterior, and our approach yields a covariance estimate by
perturbing this fixed point. Inspired by linear response theory, we call our
method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). We also show how LRVB can be
used to quickly calculate a measure of the influence of individual data points
on parameter point estimates. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of
our method by learning Gaussian mixture models for both simulated and real

attributed to an inner disk warp, caused by the interaction between the inner
disk and an inclined magnetosphere. Previous studies of NGC 2264 have shown
that similar photometric behavior is common among CTTS.
  The goal of this work is to investigate the main causes of the observed
photometric variability of CTTS in NGC 2264 that present AA Tau-like light
curves, and verify if an inner disk warp could be responsible for their
variability. We investigate veiling variability in their spectra and u-r color
variations and estimate parameters of the inner disk warp using an occultation
model proposed for AA Tau. We compare infrared and optical light curves to
analyze the dust responsible for the occultations. AA Tau-like variability is
transient on a timescale of a few years. We ascribe it to stable accretion
regimes and aperiodic variability to unstable accretion regimes and show that a
transition, and even coexistence, between the two is common. We find evidence
of hot spots associated with occultations, indicating that the occulting
structures could be located at the base of accretion columns. We find average
values of warp maximum height of 0.23 times its radial location, consistent
with AA Tau, with variations of on average 11% between rotation cycles. We show
that extinction laws in the inner disk indicate the presence of grains larger
than interstellar grains.
  The inner disk warp scenario is consistent with observations for all but one
periodic star in our sample. AA Tau-like systems comprise 14% of CTTS observed
in NGC 2264, though this increases to 35% among systems of mass
0.7M_sun<M<2.0M_sun. Assuming random inclinations, we estimate that nearly all
systems in this mass range likely possess an inner disk warp, possibly because
of a change in magnetic field configurations among stars of lower mass.

confinement can be attributed to the infrared divergence of the vector dressing
function of the inverse quark propagator. Using quenched gauge field
configurations on a $20^4$ lattice, the dressing functions of the quark
propagator as well as the dynamical quark mass function are evaluated, also in
the chiral limit. Chiral symmetry is artificially restored by removing the low
mode contribution from the quark propagator. After removing enough low-lying
modes, the dynamical quark mass function approaches the current quark mass in
the whole momentum region and goes to zero in the chiral limit. However, the
vector dressing function is unaffected by the low-mode removal. It follows that
the quark energy dispersion is still infrared divergent and quarks in such a
chiral symmetry restored phase are still confined within a hadron.

first principles molecular dynamics to examine the solvation and diffusion of
Li ions in the bulk organic solvents ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl
carbonate (EMC), and a mixture of EC/EMC. We find that Li ions are solvated by
either carbonyl or ether oxygen atoms of the solvents and sometimes by the
PF$_6^-$ anion. Li$^+$ prefers a tetrahedrally-coordinated first solvation
shell regardless of which species are involved, with the specific preferred
solvation structure dependent on the organic solvent. In addition, we calculate
Li diffusion coefficients in each electrolyte, finding slightly larger
diffusivities in the linear carbonate EMC compared to the cyclic carbonate EC.
The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient correlates with the strength of
Li$^+$ solvation. Corresponding analysis for the PF$_6^-$ anion shows greater
diffusivity associated with a weakly-bound, poorly defined first solvation

primarily on applying Expectation-Maximization (EM) on the underlying maximum

Unfortunately, EM only provides a locally optimal solution rather than a
globally optimal one. Other solutions to the problem (that do not leverage EM)
fail to provide global optimality guarantees as well. In this paper, we focus
on filtering, where tasks require the evaluation of a yes/no predicate, and
rating, where tasks elicit integer scores from a finite domain. We design
algorithms for finding the global optimal estimates of correct task answers and
worker quality for the underlying maximum likelihood problem, and characterize
the complexity of these algorithms. Our algorithms conceptually consider all
mappings from tasks to true answers (typically a very large number), leveraging
two key ideas to reduce, by several orders of magnitude, the number of mappings
under consideration, while preserving optimality. We also demonstrate that
these algorithms often find more accurate estimates than EM-based algorithms.

by whether or not its members have the ability to communicate amongst
themselves independently of non-members. This necessary condition for viability
was proposed by Myerson (1977) and is modeled via an interaction graph
$G=(V,E)$; a coalition $S\subseteq V$ is then viable if and only if the induced
graph $G[S]$ is connected. The non-emptiness of the core of a coalition game
can be tested by a well-known covering LP. Moreover, the integrality gap of its
dual packing LP defines exactly the multiplicative least-core and the relative
cost of stability of the coalition game. This gap is upper bounded by the
packing-covering ratio which, for graphical coalition games, is known to be at
most the treewidth of the interaction graph plus one (Meir et al. 2013).
  We examine the packing-covering ratio and integrality gaps of graphical
coalition games in more detail. We introduce the thicket parameter of a graph,
and prove it precisely measures the packing-covering ratio. It also
approximately measures the primal and dual integrality gaps. The thicket number
provides an upper bound of both integrality gaps. Moreover we show that for any
interaction graph, the primal integrality gap is, in the worst case, linear in
terms of the thicket number while the dual integrality gap is polynomial in
terms of it. At the heart of our results, is a graph theoretic minmax theorem
showing the thicket number is equal to the minimum width of a vine
decomposition of the coalition graph (a vine decomposition is a generalization
of a tree decomposition). We also explain how the thicket number relates to the
VC-dimension of the set system produced by the game.

patterns on the evolution of cooperation, we study a weak prisoner's dilemma
where each player's participation is probabilistic rather than certain. Players
that do not participate get a null payoff and are unable to replicate. We show
that inactivity introduces cascading failures of cooperation, which are
particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs. The
drops in the fraction of cooperators are sudden, while the spatiotemporal
reorganization of compact cooperative clusters, and thus the recovery, takes
time. Nevertheless, if the activity of players is directly proportional to
their degree, or if the interaction network is not strongly heterogeneous, the
overall evolution of cooperation is not impaired. This is because inactivity
negatively affects the potency of low-degree defectors, who are hence unable to
utilize on their inherent evolutionary advantage. Between cascading failures,
the fraction of cooperators is therefore higher than usual, which lastly
balances out the asymmetric dynamic instabilities that emerge due to
intermittent blackouts of cooperative hubs.

The particle interaction is modelled in a macroscopic way using the Hertzian
contact force with additional linear damping. The goal of the work is to
develop an efficient approximate solution of sufficient accuracy for this
problem which can be used in soft-sphere collision models for Discrete Element
Methods and for particle transport in viscous fluids. First, by the choice of
appropriate units, the number of governing parameters of the collision process
is reduced to one, which is a simple combination of known material parameters
as well as initial conditions. It provides a dimensionless parameter that
characterizes all such collisions up to dynamic similitude. Next, a rigorous
calculation of the collision time and restitution coefficient from the
governing equations, in the form of a series expansion in this parameter is
provided. Such a calculation based on first principles is particularly
interesting from a theoretical perspective. Since the governing equations
present some technical difficulties, the methods employed are also of interest
from the point of view of the analytical technique. Using further
approximations, compact expressions for the restitution coefficient and the
collision time are then provided. These are used to implement an approximate
algebraic rule for computing the desired stiffness and damping in the framework
of the adaptive collision model (Kempe & Fr\""{o}hlich, J. Fluid Mech., 709:
445-489, 2012). Numerical tests with binary as well as multiple particle
collisions are reported to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method and
its superiority in terms of numerical efficiency.

can be inferred from spectral density of the Dirac operator. This stems from
the proposition that its possible behaviors are exhausted by three distinct
types (Fig.1). The monotonic cases are standard and entail confinement with
valence chiral symmetry breaking (A) or the lack of both (C,C'). The bimodal
(anomalous) option (B) was frequently regarded as an artifact (lattice or
other) in previous studies, but we show for the first time that it persists in
the continuum limit, and conclude that it informs of a non-confining phase with
broken valence chiral symmetry. This generalization rests on the following.
$(\alpha)$ We show that bimodality in $N_f$=0 theory past deconfinement
temperature $T_c$ is stable with respect to removal of both infrared and
ultraviolet cutoffs, indicating that anomalous phase is not an artifact.
$(\beta)$ We demonstrate that transition to bimodality in $N_f$=0 is
simultaneous with the loss of confinement: anomalous phase occurs for $T_c < T
< T_{ch}$, where $T_{ch}$ is the valence chiral restoration temperature.
$(\gamma)$ Evidence is presented for thermal anomalous phase in $N_f$=2+1 QCD
at physical quark masses, whose onset too coincides with the conventional
""crossover $T_c$''. We conclude that the anomalous regime $T_c < T < T_{ch}$ is
very likely a feature of nature's strong interactions. $(\delta)$ Our past
studies of zero-temperature $N_f$=12 theories revealed that bimodality also
arises via purely light-quark effects. As a result, we expect to encounter
anomalous phase on generic paths to valence chiral restoration. We predict its
existence also for $N_f$ massless flavors ($T=0$) in the range $N_f^c < N_f <
N_f^{ch}$, where $N_f^c$ could be quite low. Conventional arguments would
associate $N_f^{ch}$ with the onset of conformal window.

median morphology trends versus stellar mass, SFR, and compactness. Morphology
correlates realistically with rotation, following classification schemes put
forth by kinematic surveys. Type fractions as a function of environment agree
roughly with data. These results imply that connections among mass, star
formation, and galaxy structure arise naturally from models matching global
star formation and halo occupation functions when simulated with accurate
methods. This raises a question of how to construct experiments on galaxy

Acceleration (COLA) method to the spatial domain. Similar to the original
temporal-domain COLA, sCOLA is an N-body method for solving for large-scale
structure in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectories
calculated in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. Incorporating the sCOLA method in
an N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the
gravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while
letting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields
are completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of
the code. Thus, running an N-body code for a small simulation volume using
sCOLA can reproduce the results of a standard N-body run for the same small
volume embedded inside a much larger simulation. We demonstrate that sCOLA can
be safely combined with the original temporal-domain COLA. sCOLA can be used as
a method for performing zoom-in simulations. It also allows N-body codes to be
made embarrassingly parallel, thus allowing for efficiently tiling a volume of
interest using grid computing. Moreover, sCOLA can be useful for cheaply
generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study

$(d+1)-$dim symmetry protected topological (SPT) state cannot be realized as
itself on a $d-$dim lattice. If the symmetry of the system is unitary, then a
formal way to determine whether a $d-$dim theory must be a boundary or not, is
to couple this theory to a gauge field (or to ""gauge"" its symmetry), and check
if there is a gauge anomaly. In this paper we discuss the following question:
can the boundary of a SPT state be driven into a fully gapped topological order
which preserves all the symmetries? We argue that if the gauge anomaly of the
boundary is ""perturbative"", then the boundary must remain gapless; while if the
boundary only has global gauge anomaly but no perturbative anomaly, then it is
possible to gap out the boundary by driving it into a topological state, when
$d \geq 2$. We will demonstrate this conclusion with two examples: (1) the $3d$
spin-1/2 chiral fermion with the well-known Witten's global anomaly, which is
the boundary of a $4d$ topological superconductor with SU(2) or U(1)$\rtimes
Z_2$ symmetry; and (2) the $4d$ boundary of a $5d$ topological superconductor
with the same symmetry. We show that these boundary systems can be driven into
a fully gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ topological order with topological degeneracy,
but this $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ topological order cannot be future driven into a
trivial confined phase that preserves all the symmetries due to some special
properties of its topological defects.

ionized by photons from a recent high activity episode - we are observing
quasar ionization echoes. We use integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini
Multi-Object Spectrograph to analyse the 3D kinematics, ionization state,
temperature and density of ionized gas in the GB SDSS J224024.1-092748. We
model the emission line spectrum of each spaxel as a superposition of up to
three Gaussian components and analyse the physical properties of each component
individually. Two narrow components, tracing the velocity fields of the disc
and an ionized gas cloud, are superimposed over the majority of the galaxy.
Fast shocks produce hot ($T_e$ $\geq$ 20,000 K), dense ($n_e$ $\geq$ 100
cm$^{-3}$), turbulent ($\sigma$ $\geq$ 600 km s$^{-1}$), [O III]-bright regions
with enhanced [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ ratios. The most prominent
such spot is consistent with a radio jet shock-heating the interstellar medium.
However, the AGN is still responsible for $\geq$ 82 per cent of the galaxy's
total [O III] luminosity, strengthening the case for previous quasar activity.
The ionized gas cloud has a strong kinematic link to the central AGN and is
co-rotating with the main body of the galaxy, suggesting that it may be the
remnant of a quasar-driven outflow. Our analysis of J224024.1-092748 indicates

(IR) photometry (8 - 500um), including deblended Spitzer and Herschel images
and taking into account photometric upper limits, we decompose the IR spectral
energy distributions into AGN and star formation components. Using the IR
luminosities due to star formation, we investigate the average SFRs as a
function of redshift and AGN luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, we
find a strong evolution of the average SFR with redshift, tracking the observed
evolution of the overall star forming galaxy population. However, we find that
the relationship between the average SFR and AGN luminosity is flat at all
redshifts and across all the AGN luminosities investigated; in comparison to
previous studies, we find less scatter amongst the average SFRs across the wide
range of AGN luminosities investigated. By comparing to empirical models, we
argue that the observed flat relationship is due to short timescale variations
in AGN luminosity, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate, which wash out
any underlying correlations between SFR and L(AGN). Furthermore, we show that
the exact form of the predicted relationship between SFR and AGN luminosity

carbon, nitrogen, and the heavy elements produced in the slow neutron-capture

evolution and nucleosynthesis of AGB stars, and this is especially the case at
low metallicity, where most of the stars with high enough masses to enter the
AGB have evolved to become white dwarfs and can no longer be observed. The
stellar population in the Galactic halo is of low mass ($\lesssim
0.85M_{\odot}$) and only a few observed stars have evolved beyond the first
giant branch. However, we have evidence that low-metallicity AGB stars in
binary systems have interacted with their low-mass secondary companions in the
past. The aim of this work is to investigate AGB nucleosynthesis at low
metallicity by studying the surface abundances of chemically peculiar very
metal-poor stars of the halo observed in binary systems. To this end we select
a sample of 15 carbon- and $s$-element-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-$s$) halo
stars that are found in binary systems with measured orbital periods. With our
model of binary evolution and AGB nucleosynthesis, we determine the binary
configuration that best reproduces, at the same time, the observed orbital
period and surface abundances of each star of the sample. The observed periods
provide tight constraints on our model of wind mass transfer in binary stars,

temperature, porosity, thickness and composition. The experiments are analyzed
by applying Fick's diffusion equation under the assumption that mixing is due
to CO diffusion into an immobile H2O ice. The extracted energy barrier for CO
diffusion into amorphous H2O ice is ~160 K. This is effectively a surface
diffusion barrier. The derived barrier is low compared to current surface
diffusion barriers in use in astrochemical models. Its adoption may
significantly change the expected timescales for different ice processes in
interstellar environments.

the construction of a match list $L(s,t)=\{(i,j):s_{i}=t_{j}\}$ where $s$ and
$t$ are the strings to be compared; such match list contains only the required
data that contribute to the result. To compute efficiently the SSK, we extended
the layered range tree data structure to a layered range sum tree, a
range-aggregation data structure. The whole process takes $ O(p|L|\log|L|)$
time and $O(|L|\log|L|)$ space, where $|L|$ is the size of the match list and
$p$ is the length of the SSK. We present empiric evaluations of our approach
against the dynamic and the sparse programming approaches both on synthetically

efficiency of our approach for large alphabet size except for very short

nature of core-collapse supernovae and their compact remnants. We demonstrate
that internal gravity waves (IGW), excited via envelope convection during a red
supergiant phase or during vigorous late time burning phases, can have a
significant impact on the rotation rate of the pre-SN core. In typical ($10 \,
M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 20 \, M_\odot$) supernova progenitors, IGW may
substantially spin down the core, leading to iron core rotation periods $P_{\rm
min,Fe} \gtrsim 30 \, {\rm s}$. Angular momentum (AM) conservation during the
supernova would entail minimum NS rotation periods of $P_{\rm min,NS} \gtrsim 3
\, {\rm ms}$. In most cases, the combined effects of magnetic torques and IGW
AM transport likely lead to substantially longer rotation periods. However, the
stochastic influx of AM delivered by IGW during shell burning phases inevitably
spin up a slowly rotating stellar core, leading to a maximum possible core
rotation period. We estimate maximum iron core rotation periods of $P_{\rm
max,Fe} \lesssim 5 \times 10^3 \, {\rm s}$ in typical core-collapse supernova
progenitors, and a corresponding spin period of $P_{\rm max, NS} \lesssim 500
\, {\rm ms}$ for newborn neutron stars. This is comparable to the typical birth
spin periods of most radio pulsars. Stochastic spin-up via IGW during shell
O/Si burning may thus determine the initial rotation rate of most neutron
stars. For a given progenitor, this theory predicts a Maxwellian distribution
in pre-collapse core rotation frequency that is uncorrelated with the spin of
the overlying envelope.

that induce coplanarity. In most real-world applications, even though the
environment is 3D, the grounded sensor nodes are usually deployed on 2D planar
surfaces. Examples of these surfaces include structures seen in both indoor
(e.g. floors, doors, walls, tables etc.) and outdoor (e.g. mountains, valleys,
hills etc.) environments. In such environments, sensor nodes typically appear
as coplanar node clusters. We refer to this type of a deployment as a planar
deployment. When there is a planar deployment, the coplanarity causes
difficulties to the traditional range-based multilateration algorithms because
a node cannot be unambiguously localized if the distance measurements to that
node are from coplanar nodes. Thus, many already localized groups of nodes are
rendered ineffective in the process just because they are coplanar. We,
therefore propose an algorithm called Coplanarity Based Localization (CBL) that
can be used as an extension of any localization algorithm to avoid most flips
caused by coplanarity. CBL first performs a 2D localization among the nodes
that are clustered on the same surface, and then finds the positions of these
clusters in 3D. We have carried out experiments using trilateration for 2D
localization, and quadrilateration for 3D localization, and experimentally
verified that exploiting the clustering information leads to a more precise
localization than mere quadrilateration. We also propose a heuristic to extract
the clustering information in case it is not available, which is yet to be
improved in the future.

measuring the relative growth velocity of domains during ripening, we estimate
that the driving force for alignment is on the order of 0.1 meV per C atom and
increases with rotation angle. A simple model of the orientation-dependent

show high degrees of apparent 'randomness' - a property that has been described
as 'protean behaviour'. Here we present a method of quantifying the escape
trajectories of individual animals using a path complexity approach. When fish
(Pseudomugil signifer) were attacked either on their own or in groups, we find
that an individual's path rapidly increases in entropy (our measure of
complexity) following the attack. For individuals on their own, this entropy
remains elevated (indicating a more random path) for a sustained period (10
seconds) after the attack, whilst it falls more quickly for individuals in
groups. The entropy of the path is context dependent. When attacks towards
single fish come from greater distances, a fish's path shows less complexity
compared to attacks that come from short range. This context dependency effect
did not exist, however, when individuals were in groups. Nor did the path
complexity of individuals in groups depend on a fish's local density of
neighbours. We separate out the components of speed and direction changes to
determine which of these components contributes to the overall increase in path
complexity following an attack. We found that both speed and direction measures
contribute similarly to an individual's path's complexity in absolute terms.
Our work highlights the adaptive behavioural tactics that animals use to avoid
predators and also provides a novel method for quantifying the escape
trajectories of animals.

that semiconducting films composed of disordered molecular subunits, unlike
expectations for their perfectly ordered counterparts, can exhibit a
time-dependent diffusivity in which the effective early time diffusion constant
is larger than that of the steady state. This observation has led to
speculation about what role, if any, microscopic disorder may play in enhancing
exciton transport properties. In this article, we present the results of a
model study aimed at addressing this point. Specifically, we present a general
model, based upon F\""orster theory, for incoherent exciton diffusion in a
material composed of independent molecular subunits with static energetic
disorder. Energetic disorder leads to heterogeneity in molecule-to-molecule
transition rates which we demonstrate has two important consequences related to
exciton transport. First, the distribution of local site-specific diffusivity
is broadened in a manner that results in a decrease in average exciton
diffusivity relative to that in a perfectly ordered film. Second, since
excitons prefer to make transitions that are downhill in energy, the steady
state distribution of exciton energies is biased towards low energy molecular
subunits, those that exhibit reduced diffusivity relative to a perfectly
ordered film. These effects combine to reduce the net diffusivity in a manner
that is time dependent and grows more pronounced as disorder is increased.
Notably, however, we demonstrate that the presence of energetic disorder can
give rise to a population of molecular subunits with exciton transfer rates
exceeding that of subunits in an energetically uniform material. Such
enhancements may play an important role in processes that are sensitive to
molecular-scale fluctuations in exciton density field.

continuum emission at 6173{\AA}, and transient seismic emission. We selected
those flares observed by RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager) with a considerable flux above 50 keV between January 1, 2010 and June
26, 2014. We then used data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard
the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO/HMI) to search for excess visible continuum
emission and new sunquakes not previously reported. We found a total of 18
sunquakes out of 75 investigated. All of the sunquakes were associated with a
enhancement of the visible continuum during the flare time. Finally, we
calculated a coefficient of correlation for a set of dichotomic variables
related to these observations. We found a strong correlation between two of the
standard helioseismic detection techniques, and between sunquakes and visible
continuum enhancements. We discuss the phenomenological connectivity between
these physical quantities and the observational difficulties of detecting

temperature passbands of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). However, when
and where the MFR is built up are still elusive. In this paper, we investigate
two MFRs (MFR1 and MFR2) in detail, whose eruptions produced two energetic
solar flares and CMEs on 2014 April 18 and 2014 September 10, respectively. The
AIA EUV images reveal that for a long time prior to their eruption, both MFR1
and MFR2 are under formation, which is probably through magnetic reconnection
between two groups of sheared arcades driven by the shearing and converging
flows in the photosphere near the polarity inversion line. At the footpoints of
the MFR1, the \textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} Si IV, C II, and
Mg II lines exhibit weak to moderate redshifts and a non-thermal broadening in
the pre-flare phase. However, a relatively large blueshift and an extremely
strong non-thermal broadening are found at the formation site of the MFR2.
These spectral features consolidate the proposition that the reconnection plays
an important role in the formation of MFRs. For the MFR1, the reconnection
outflow may propagate along its legs, penetrating into the transition region
and the chromosphere at the footpoints. For the MFR2, the reconnection probably
takes place in the lower atmosphere and results in the strong blueshift and
non-thermal broadening for the Mg II, C II, and Si IV lines.

calculations is presented. The method is applicable to computational tasks that
solve a sequence of eigenvalue problems where the solution for a particular
iteration is similar but not identical to the solution from the previous
iteration. Such problems occur frequently when performing electronic structure
calculations in which the eigenvectors are solutions to the Kohn-Sham
equations. The eigenvectors are represented in some type of basis but the
problem sizes are normally too large for direct diagonalization in that basis.
Instead a subspace diagonalization procedure is employed in which matrix
elements of the Hamiltonian operator are generated and the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the resulting reduced matrix are obtained using a standard
eigensolver from a package such as LAPACK or SCALAPACK. While this method works
well and is widely used, the standard eigensolvers scale poorly on massively
parallel computer systems for the matrix sizes typical of electronic structure
calculations. We present a new method that utilizes a partitioned folded

transmission of electrons. At the level of the single-band tight-binding model
a nanodevice is viewed as a weighted undirected graph, with a vertex weight
given by the on-site energy and the edge weight given by the tight-binding
hopping parameter. A quantum dragon is a weighted undirected graph which when
connected to idealized semi-infinite input and output leads, has the electron
transmission probability ${\cal T}(E)$$=$$1$ for all electron energies $E$. The
probability ${\cal T}(E)$ is obtained from the solution of the time-independent
Schr\""odinger equation. A graph must have finely tuned tight-binding parameters
in order to have ${\cal T}(E)$$=$$1$. This paper addresses classes of weighted
graphs which can be tuned, by adjusting a small fraction of the total weights,
to be a quantum dragon. We prove that with proper tuning any nanodevice can be
a quantum dragon. Three prescriptions are presented to tune a weighted graph
into a quantum dragon nanodevice. The implications of the prescriptions for
physical nanodevices is discussed.

(or very light) boson, is studied. Such dark matter can arise in simple hidden
sector gauge models, including those featuring an unbroken $U(1)'$ gauge
symmetry, leading to a dark photon. Previous work has shown that such models
can not only explain the LSS and CMB, but potentially also dark matter
phenomena on small scales, such as the inferred cored structure of dark matter
halos. In this picture, dark matter halos of disk galaxies not only cool via
dissipative interactions but are also heated via ordinary supernovae
(facilitated by an assumed photon - dark photon kinetic mixing interaction).
This interaction between the dark matter halo and ordinary baryons, a very
special feature of these types of models, plays a critical role in governing
the physical properties of the dark matter halo. Here, we further study the
implications of this type of dissipative dark matter for disk galaxies.
Building on earlier work, we develop a simple formalism which aims to describe
the effects of dissipative dark matter in a fairly model independent way. This
formalism is then applied to generic disk galaxies. We also consider specific
examples, including NGC 1560 and a sample of dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE
THINGS survey. We find that dissipative dark matter, as developed here, does a
fairly good job accounting for the rotation curves of the galaxies considered.
Not only does dissipative dark matter explain the linear rise of the rotational
velocity of dwarf galaxies at small radii, but it can also explain the observed
wiggles in rotation curves which are known to be correlated with corresponding
features in the disk gas distribution.

feasibility of detecting exorings with present and future photometric
sensitivities by seeking anomalous deviations in the residuals of a standard
transit light curve fit, at the level of ~100 ppm for Kronian rings. In this
work, we explore two much larger observational consequences of exorings: (1)
the significant increase in transit depth that may lead to the
misclassification of ringed planetary candidates as false-positives and/or the
underestimation of planetary density; and (2) the so-called ""photo-ring""
effect, a new asterodensity profiling effect, revealed by a comparison of the
light curve derived stellar density to that measured with independent methods
(e.g., asteroseismology). While these methods do not provide an unambiguous
detection of exorings, we show that the large amplitude of these effects
combined with their relatively simple analytic description, makes them highly
suited to large-scale surveys to identify candidate ringed planets worthy of
more detailed investigation. Moreover, these methods lend themselves to
ensemble analyses seeking to uncover evidence of a population of ringed
planets. We describe the method in detail, develop the basic underlying
formalism and test it in the parameter space of rings and transit config-

Visual Sensor Networks (VSNs) require the transmission of visual content on a
bandwidth-limited network, from a peripheral node to a processing unit.
Traditionally, a Compress-Then-Analyze approach has been pursued, in which
sensing nodes acquire and encode the pixel-level representation of the visual
content, that is subsequently transmitted to a sink node in order to be
processed. This approach might not represent the most effective solution, since
several analysis applications leverage a compact representation of the content,
thus resulting in an inefficient usage of network resources. Furthermore,
coding artifacts might significantly impact the accuracy of the visual task at
hand. To tackle such limitations, an orthogonal approach named
Analyze-Then-Compress has been proposed. According to such a paradigm, sensing
nodes are responsible for the extraction of visual features, that are encoded
and transmitted to a sink node for further processing. In spite of improved
task efficiency, such paradigm implies the central processing node not being
able to reconstruct a pixel-level representation of the visual content. In this
paper we propose an effective compromise between the two paradigms, namely
Hybrid-Analyze-Then-Compress (HATC) that aims at jointly encoding visual
content and local image features. Furthermore, we show how a target tradeoff
between image quality and task accuracy might be achieved by accurately
allocating the bitrate to either visual content or local features.

laser in a low density gas. The center of mass motion of the particle is
subjected, at the same time, to feedback cooling and a parametric modulation
driving the system into a non-equilibrium steady state. Based on the Langevin
equation of motion of the particle, we derive an analytical expression for the
energy distribution of this steady state showing that the average and variance
of the energy distribution can be controlled separately by appropriate choice
of the friction, cooling and modulation parameters. Energy distributions
determined in computer simulations and measured in a laboratory experiment
agree well with the analytical predictions. We analyse the particle motion also
in terms of the quadratures and find thermal squeezing depending on the degree
of detuning.

occurs if the star orbits just outside the tidal radius, resulting in a mild
stripping of mass. Thus, if a star orbits a central black hole on one of these
bound eccentric orbits, weaker outbursts will occur recurring every orbital
period. Thanks to five Swift observations, we observed a recent flare from the
close by (92 Mpc) galaxy IC 3599, where a possible TDE was already observed in
December 1990 during the Rosat All-Sky Survey. By light curve modeling and
spectral fitting, we account for all these events as the non-disruptive tidal
stripping of a single star into a 9.5 yr highly eccentric bound orbit. This is
the first example of periodic partial tidal disruptions, possibly spoon-feeding

cellular operators and mobile users are increasingly interested in offloading
the traffic from cellular networks to Wi-Fi networks. However, previously
proposed offloading schemes mainly focus on reducing the cellular data usage,
without paying too much attention on the quality of service (QoS) requirements
of the applications. In this paper, we study the Wi-Fi offloading problem with
delay-tolerant applications under usage-based pricing. We aim to achieve a good
tradeoff between the user's payment and its QoS characterized by the file
transfer deadline. We first propose a general Delay-Aware Wi-Fi Offloading and
Network Selection (DAWN) algorithm for a general single-user decision scenario.
We then analytically establish the sufficient conditions, under which the
optimal policy exhibits a threshold structure in terms of both the time and
file size. As a result, we propose a monotone DAWN algorithm that approximately
solves the general offloading problem, and has a much lower computational
complexity comparing to the optimal algorithm. Simulation results show that
both the general and monotone DAWN schemes achieve a high probability of
completing file transfer under a stringent deadline, and require the lowest
payment under a non-stringent deadline as compared with three heuristic
schemes.

in photosynthesis in green sulfur bacteria - is remarkably efficient in
transferring excitation energy from light harvesting antenna molecules to a
reaction center. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that
quantum coherence and entanglement may play a role in this excitation energy
transfer (EET). We examine whether bipartite quantum nonlocality, a property
that expresses a stronger-than-entanglement form of correlation, exists between
different pairs of chromophores in the FMO complex when modeling the EET by the
hierarchically coupled equations of motion method. We compare the results for
nonlocality with the amount of bipartite entanglement in the system. In
particular, we analyze in what way these correlation properties are affected by
different initial conditions. It is found that bipartite nonlocality only
exists when the initial conditions are chosen in an unphysiological manner and
probably is absent when considering the EET in the FMO complex in its natural
habitat. It is also seen that nonlocality and entanglement behave quite
differently in this system. In particular, for localized initial states,
nonlocality only exists on a very short time scale and then drops to zero in an
abrupt manner. As already known from previous studies, quantum entanglement
between chromophore pairs on the other hand is oscillating and exponentially
decaying and follow thereby a pattern more similar to the chromophore
population dynamics. The abrupt disappearance of nonlocality in the presence of
nonvanishing entanglement is a phenomenon we call nonlocality sudden death; a
striking manifestation of the difference between these two types of
correlations in quantum systems.

metastable states and higher lying excited states like the
$\rm{5d^{2}~^{3}F_{2}}$ state in barium. The state is efficiently populated by
driving strong transitions from metastable states within the cooling cycle of
the barium MOT. The lifetime is inferred from the increase of MOT fluorescence
after the transfer of up to $30\,\%$ of the trapped atoms to this state. The
radiative decay of the $\rm{5d^{2}~^{3}F_{2}}$ state cascades to the cooling
cycle of the MOT with a probability of $96.0(7)\,\%$ corresponding to a trap
loss of $4.0(7)\,\%$ and its lifetime is determined to $\rm{160(10)~\mu s}$.
This is in good agreement with the theoretically calculated lifetime of
$\rm{190~\mu s}$ [J. Phys. B, {\bf 40}, 227 (2007)]. The determined loss of
$4.0(7)\,\%$ from the cooling cycle is compared with the theoretically
calculated branching ratios. This measurement extends the efficacy of trapped
atoms to measure lifetimes of higher, long-lived states and validate the atomic

the use of SZ intensity change, Delta I_SZ(nu), at different frequencies, and
on a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain approach. By applying this method to the sample

T_CMB(z)=T_0(1+z)^(1-beta) to be beta= 0.022 +/- 0.018, at 1 sigma uncertainty,

estimates obtained with bootstrap or permutation tests since the analytical
p-values underlying all hypotheses are usually unknown. This article considers
the allocation of a pre-specified total number of Monte Carlo simulations $K
\in \mathbb{N}$ (i.e., permutations or draws from a bootstrap distribution) to
a given number of $m \in \mathbb{N}$ hypotheses in order to approximate their
p-values $p \in [0,1]^m$ in an optimal way, in the sense that the allocation
minimises the total expected number of misclassified hypotheses. A
misclassification occurs if a decision on a single hypothesis, obtained with an
approximated p-value, differs from the one obtained if its p-value was known
analytically. The contribution of this article is threefold: Under the
assumption that $p$ is known and $K \in \mathbb{R}$, and using a normal
approximation of the Binomial distribution, the optimal real-valued allocation
of $K$ simulations to $m$ hypotheses is derived when correcting for
multiplicity with the Bonferroni correction, both when computing the p-value
estimates with or without a pseudo-count. Computational subtleties arising in
the former case will be discussed. Second, with the help of an algorithm based
on simulated annealing, empirical evidence is given that the optimal integer
allocation is likely of the same form as the optimal real-valued allocation,
and that both seem to coincide asympotically. Third, an empirical study on
simulated and real data demonstrates that a recently proposed sampling
algorithm based on Thompson sampling asympotically mimics the optimal
(real-valued) allocation when the p-values are unknown and thus estimated at
runtime.

that the influence of dephasing-type interactions, i.e., elastic collisions
with a background bath of phonons, critically depends on the nature of the bath
modes. In particular, for long-range phonons corresponding to a common bath,
the dynamics of the ""bright state"" (the collective superposition of molecular
vibrations coupling to the cavity mode) is effectively decoupled from other
system eigenstates. For the case of independent baths (or short-range phonons),
incoherent energy transfer occurs between the bright state and the uncoupled
dark states. However, these processes are suppressed when the Rabi splitting is
larger than the frequency range of the bath modes, as achieved in a recent
experiment [Shalabney et al., Nat. Commun. 6, 5981 (2015)]. In both cases, the
dynamics can thus be described through a single collective oscillator coupled
to a photonic mode, making this system an ideal candidate to explore cavity
optomechanics at room temperature.

corresponding to the textbook two-level atom case, the optical spectrum shows
the characteristic Mollow triplet for strong laser drive, while the

additional features appear in both optical and noise spectra. These differences
are more pronounced in the regime of a weakly driven transition: whereas the

extra noise terms related to spontaneous Raman transitions. We also discuss the
possibility to experimentally observe these predicted differences for the
commonly encountered case where the laser drive has excess noise in its phase

Recently, theoretical computer scientists have contributed sophisticated
algorithms for solving linear systems with symmetric diagonally dominant
matrices (a class to which Laplacian matrices belong) in provably nearly-linear
time. While these algorithms are highly interesting from a theoretical
perspective, there are no published results how they perform in practice.
  With this paper we address this gap. We provide the first implementation of
the combinatorial solver by [Kelner et al., STOC 2013], which is particularly
appealing for implementation due to its conceptual simplicity. The algorithm
exploits that a Laplacian matrix corresponds to a graph; solving Laplacian
linear systems amounts to finding an electrical flow in this graph with the
help of cycles induced by a spanning tree with the low-stretch property.
  The results of our comprehensive experimental study are ambivalent. They
confirm a nearly-linear running time, but for reasonable inputs the constant
factors make the solver much slower than methods with higher asymptotic
complexity. One other aspect predicted by theory is confirmed by our findings,
though: Spanning trees with lower stretch indeed reduce the solver's running
time. Yet, simple spanning tree algorithms perform in practice better than
those with a guaranteed low stretch.

four are likely probing galactic outflows, three are likely probing extended
gaseous disks, and the remaining three are not classifiable because they are
viewed face-on. In this paper we present a detailed comparison between the
line-of-sight kinematics and the host galaxy emission kinematics for the pairs
suitable for wind studies. We find that the kinematic profile shapes
(asymmetries) can be well reproduced by a purely geometrical wind model with a
constant wind speed, except for one pair (towards J2357$-$2736) that has the
smallest impact parameter b = 6 kpc and requires an accelerated wind flow.
Globally, the outflow speeds are $\sim$ 100 km/s and the mass ejection rates
(or $\dot M _{\rm out}$) in the gas traced by the low-ionization species are
similar to the star formation rate (SFR), meaning that the mass loading factor,
$\eta$ = $\dot M _{\rm out}$/SFR, is $\sim$1.0. The outflow speeds are also
smaller than the local escape velocity, which implies that the outflows do not
escape the galaxy halo and are likely to fall back into the interstellar

scale on which temporal correlations occur. They allow the computation of
jitter corrected cross correlograms and the performance of an associated
statistically robust hypothesis test to decide whether observed correlations at
a given time scale are significant. Currently used Monte Carlo methods
approximate the probability distribution of coincidences. They require
generating $N_{\rm MC}$ simulated spike trains of length $T$ and calculating
their correlation with another spike train up to lag $\tau_{\max}$. This is
computationally costly $O(N_{\rm MC} \times T \times \tau_{\max})$ and it
introduces errors in estimating the $p$ value. Instead, we propose to compute
the distribution in closed form, with a complexity of $O(C_{\max}
\log(C_{\max}) \tau_{\max})$, where $C_{\max}$ is the maximum possible number
of coincidences. All results are then exact rather than approximate, and as a
consequence, the $p$-values obtained are the theoretically best possible for
the available data and test statistic. In addition, simulations with realistic
parameters predict a speed increase over Monte Carlo methods of two orders of
magnitude for hypothesis testing, and four orders of magnitude for computing
the full jitter-corrected cross correlogram.

the translation quality. However, the existing models predict the target
translation with only the source- and target-side local context information. In
practice, distinguishing good translations from bad ones does not only depend
on the local features, but also rely on the global sentence-level information.
In this paper, we explore the source-side global sentence-level features for
target-side local translation prediction. We propose a novel
bilingually-constrained chunk-based convolutional neural network to learn
sentence semantic representations. With the sentence-level feature
representation, we further design a feed-forward neural network to better
predict translations using both local and global information. The large-scale
experiments show that our method can obtain substantial improvements in
translation quality over the strong baseline: the hierarchical phrase-based
translation model augmented with the neural network joint model.

for additive actuator and sensor faults in unknown linear time-invariant
systems, with enhanced robustness to stochastic identification errors.
State-of-the-art methods construct fault estimators with identified state-space
models or Markov parameters, but they do not compensate for identification
errors. Motivated by this limitation, we first propose a receding horizon fault
estimator parameterized by predictor Markov parameters. This estimator provides
(asymptotically) unbiased fault estimates as long as the subsystem from faults
to outputs has no unstable transmission zeros. When the identified Markov
parameters are used to construct the above fault estimator, zero-mean
stochastic identification errors appear as model uncertainty multiplied with
unknown fault signals and online system inputs/outputs (I/O). Based on this
fault estimation error analysis, we formulate a mixed-norm problem for the
offline robust design that regards online I/O data as unknown. An alternative
online mixed-norm problem is also proposed that can further reduce estimation
errors when the online I/O data have large amplitudes, at the cost of increased
computational burden. Based on a geometrical interpretation of the two proposed
mixed-norm problems, systematic methods to tune the user-defined parameters
therein are given to achieve desired performance trade-offs. Simulation
examples illustrate the benefits of our proposed methods compared to recent
literature.

semi-classical model of the structure of a hydrogen atom introduced by Bohr in
1913. In a certain sense, QNMs represent the ""electron"" which jumps from a
level to another one and the absolute values of the QNMs frequencies
""triggered"" by emissions (Hawking radiation) and absorption of particles
represent the energy ""shells"" of the ""gravitational hydrogen atom"". Important
consequences on the BH information puzzle are discussed. In fact, it is shown
that the time evolution of this ""Bohr-like BH model"" obeys to a time dependent
Schr\""odinger equation which permits the final BH state to be a pure quantum
state instead of a mixed one. Thus, information comes out in BH evaporation, in
agreement with the assumption by 't Hooft that Schr\""oedinger equations can be
used universally for all dynamics in the universe. We also show that, in
addition, our approach solves the entanglement problem connected with the
information paradox. We emphasize that Bohr model is an approximated model of
the hydrogen atom with respect to the valence shell atom model of full quantum
mechanics. In the same way, we expect the Bohr-like BH model to be an

typical weather conditions that may be expected in 2015. It also allows us to
validate the usefulness of short-term weather forecasts, which may be used to
increase the probability of observing the eclipse.

scans while easily taking advantage of the multi-core architecture of current
processors. It takes an easy to read and write parameter scan definition file
format as input. Based on the parameter ranges and other options contained
therein, it distributes the calculation of the parameter space over multiple
processes and possibly computers. The derived data is saved in a plain text
file format readable by most plotting software. The supported scanning
strategies include: grid scan, random scan, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, numerical
optimization. Several example parameter scans are shown and compared with
results in the literature.

Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SGXBs) formed by 4 sources: XTE J1855-026, a
classical SGXB with long-term stable X-ray flux; AX J1841.0-0535 and AX
J1845.0-0433, two supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) with the X-ray
emission mostly dominated by flaring; and IGR J00370+6122, something in between
these 2 sub-groups. The physical processes that produce these observable
differences are still a matter of debate. In this PhD Thesis I performed a
study of these 4 different systems to provide new data to constrain the models.
This study consists of:(i) the determination of the orbital solution,(ii) a
systematic study of the wind behavior along the orbit by the measure of Halpha
variations,(iii) a model of stellar atmospheres of the donor star,(iv)
establish whether there are X-ray flux variations modulated by the orbital
period. The study of the wind shows that Halpha variations are dominated by
intrinsic wind processes. The stellar atmospheres study shows that the
supergiant stars that harbor these binaries have a higher projected rotational
velocity, higher He abundance and higher N/C ratio than that of isolated
supergiant stars. The results of this study show that the eccentricity of the
binary does not have a simple correlation with the differences in the X-ray
flux of the different sub-groups. Therefore, the idea of a more complex
scenario is consolidated. The discovery of a new type of system, IGR
J00370+6122, which properties do not fit in any of the established sub-groups,
reinforces the idea of a continuum in the observed properties more than a
strict classification of systems. Furthermore, I have developed a pipeline to
reduce spectra of the FRODOSpec spectrograph at the Liverpool Telescope
optimized for the reduction of the red spectra of the obscured supergiants that
we find in these SGXBs.
