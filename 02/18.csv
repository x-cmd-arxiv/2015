The existence of such a category was predicted by [STZ], who moreover
conjectured its equivalence to a category of sheaves on the front plane with
singular support meeting infinity in the knot. After showing that the

applications to convergence analysis of discrete-time stochastic extremum

time, the other is discrete time), we develop discrete-time stochastic
averaging theorem for locally Lipschitz nonlinear systems with stochastic
perturbation. Our results only need some simple and applicable conditions,
which are easy to verify, and remove a significant restriction present in
existing results: global Lipschitzness of the nonlinear vector field. Secondly,
we provide a discrete-time stochastic extremum seeking algorithm for a static
map, in which measurement noise is considered and an ergodic discrete-time
stochastic process is used as the excitation signal. Finally, for discrete-time
nonlinear dynamical systems, in which the output equilibrium map has an
extremum, we present a discrete-time stochastic extremum seeking scheme and,
with a singular perturbation reduction, we prove the stability of the reduced
system. Compared with classical stochastic approximation methods, while the
convergence that we prove is in a weaker sense, the conditions of the algorithm
are easy to verify and no requirements (e.g., boundedness) are imposed on the

evaporation of very small grains (VSGs) and the production of gas-phase
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Our goal is to achieve better insight
into the composition and evolution of evaporating very small grains (eVSGs) and
PAHs through analyzing the infrared (IR) aliphatic and aromatic emission bands.
We combined spectro-imagery in the near- and mid-IR to study the spatial
evolution of the emission bands in the prototypical PDR NGC 7023. We used
near-IR spectra obtained with AKARI to trace the evolution of the 3.3$\mu$m and
3.4$\mu$m bands, which are associated with aromatic and aliphatic C-H bonds on
PAHs. The spectral fitting involves an additional broad feature centred at
3.45$\mu$m. Mid-IR observations obtained with Spitzer are used to discriminate
the signatures of eVSGs, neutral and cationic PAHs. We correlated the spatial
evolution of all these bands with the intensity of the UV field to explore the
processing of their carriers. The intensity of the 3.45$\mu$m plateau shows an
excellent correlation with that of the 3.3$\mu$m aromatic band (correlation
coefficient R = 0.95), indicating that the plateau is dominated by the emission
from aromatic bonds. The ratio of the 3.4$\mu$m and 3.3$\mu$m band intensity
($I_{3.4}/I_{3.3}$) decreases by a factor of 4 at the PDR interface from the
more UV-shielded to the more exposed layers. The transition region between the
aliphatic and aromatic material is found to correspond spatially with the
transition zone between neutral PAHs and eVSGs. We conclude that the
photo-processing of eVSGs leads to the production of PAHs with attached
aliphatic sidegroups that are revealed by the 3.4$\mu$m emission band. Our
analysis provides evidence for the presence of very small grains of mixed
aromatic and aliphatic composition in PDRs.

OGLE-2012-SN-006, discovered and monitored by the OGLE-IV survey, and
spectroscopically followed by PESSTO at late phases. Stringent pre-discovery
limits constrain the explosion epoch with fair precision to JD = 2456203.8 +-
4.0. The rise time to the I-band light curve maximum is about two weeks. The
object reaches the peak absolute magnitude M(I) = -19.65 +- 0.19 on JD =
2456218.1 +- 1.8. After maximum, the light curve declines for about 25 days
with a rate of 4 mag per 100d. The symmetric I-band peak resembles that of
canonical Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe), whereas SNe Ibn usually exhibit
asymmetric and narrower early-time light curves. Since 25 days past maximum,
the light curve flattens with a decline rate slower than that of the 56Co to
56Fe decay, although at very late phases it steepens to approach that rate. An
early-time spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum, with only a marginal
evidence for the presence of He I lines marking this SN Type. This spectrum
shows broad absorptions bluewards than 5000A, likely O II lines, which are
similar to spectral features observed in super-luminous SNe at early epochs.
The object has been spectroscopically monitored by PESSTO from 90 to 180 days
after peak, and these spectra show the typical features observed in a number of
SN 2006jc-like events, including a blue spectral energy distribution and
prominent and narrow (v(FWHM) ~ 1900 km/s) He I emission lines. This suggests
that the ejecta are interacting with He-rich circumstellar material. The
detection of broad (10000 km/s) O I and Ca II features likely produced in the
SN ejecta (including the [O I] 6300A,6364A doublet in the latest spectra) lends
support to the interpretation of OGLE-2012-SN-006 as a core-collapse event.

peak of M(R) = -18.86 +- 0.21. Its early light curve shows similarities with
normal SNe Ib, with a rise to maximum slower than most SNe Ibn. The spectra are
dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni He I lines
indicating the presence of a slow-moving, He-rich circumstellar medium. At
later epochs the spectra well match those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc,
although the broader lines suggest that a significant amount of He was still
present in the stellar envelope at the time of the explosion. SN 2011hw is
somewhat different. It was discovered after the first maximum, but the light
curve shows a double-peak. The absolute magnitude at discovery is similar to
that of the second peak (M(R) = -18.59 +- 0.25), and slightly fainter than the
average of SNe Ibn. Though the spectra of SN 2011hw are similar to those of SN
2006jc, coronal lines and narrow Balmer lines are cleary detected. This
indicates substantial interaction of the SN ejecta with He-rich, but not
H-free, circumstellar material. The spectra of SN 2011hw suggest that it is a
transitional SN Ibn/IIn event similar to SN 2005la. While for SN 2010al the
spectro-photometric evolution favours a H-deprived Wolf-Rayet progenitor (of
WN-type), we agree with the conclusion of Smith et al. (2012) that the
precursor of SN 2011hw was likely in transition from a luminous blue variable
to an early Wolf-Rayet (Ofpe/WN9) stage.

the symmetry properties of any linear response tensor relevant to the field of

emerge without making reference to the two-current model. Numerical studies
confirm these findings and demonstrate for (Au$_{1-x}$Pt$_{\rm x}$)$_4$Sc that
the longitudinal spin conductivity may be in the same order of magnitude as the
conventional transverse one. The presented formalism only relies on the

down steeply and reaches T$_{C}$ = 147 K at p = 15.2 GPa. At 20 GPa the

exchange interactions mediated by the 5f hybridization with the non-f states.
The external pressure first enhances the exchange coupling of the 5f moments,
but eventually suppresses the order by washing out the 5f moments. Such a
two-band model is adequate for the weakly delocalized 5f states. The
spin-disorder resistivity, which produces very high \rho-values (300

LSQ13ccw is somewhat different: while it also exhibits a very fast rise to

and experiences an extremely rapid post-peak decline similar to that observed
in the peculiar SN~Ib 2002bj. A stringent prediscovery limit and an early
marginal detection of LSQ13ccw allow us to determine the explosion time with an
uncertainty of 1 day. The spectra of LSQ12btw show the typical narrow He~I
emission lines characterising Type Ibn SNe, suggesting that the SN ejecta are
interacting with He-rich circumstellar material. The He I lines in the spectra
of LSQ13ccw exhibit weak narrow emissions superposed on broad components. An
unresolved Halpha line is also detected, suggesting a tentative Type Ibn/IIn
classification. As for other SNe~Ibn, we argue that LSQ12btw and LSQ13ccw
likely result from the explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars that experienced
instability phases prior to core collapse. We inspect the host galaxies of SNe
Ibn, and we show that all of them but one are hosted in spiral galaxies, likely

the appearance of strangeness in stars with a mass as small as $\sim 1

energy slope and including hyperons is to farther reduce the radius. Neutron
star maximum mass evolve non-monotonically with the symmetry energy slope, and
the smallest masses are obtained for values $L\sim 80$ MeV. Other neutron star
variables evolve nonlinearly with the slope of the symmetry energy and depend

probabilistic inference in graphical models, such as Markov Random Fields
(MRFs). In graphs with cycles, however, no exact convergence guarantees for BP
are known, in general. For the case when all edges in the MRF carry the same
symmetric, doubly stochastic potential, recent works have proposed to
approximate BP by linearizing the update equations around default values, which
was shown to work well for the problem of node classification. The present
paper generalizes all prior work and derives an approach that approximates
loopy BP on any pairwise MRF with the problem of solving a linear equation
system. This approach combines exact convergence guarantees and a fast matrix
implementation with the ability to model heterogenous networks. Experiments on
synthetic graphs with planted edge potentials show that the linearization has
comparable labeling accuracy as BP for graphs with weak potentials, while
speeding-up inference by orders of magnitude.

in Algols. However, the systemic mass-loss rate is poorly constrained by

simulations. Moreover, systemic mass loss may lead to observational signatures
that are still to be found. We investigate the impact of the outflowing gas and
the possible presence of dust grains on the spectral energy distribution (SED).
We used the 1D plasma code Cloudy and compared the results with the 3D
Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code Skirt for dusty simulations. The
circumbinary mass-distribution and binary parameters are computed with
state-of-the-art binary calculations done with the Binstar evolution code. The
outflowing material reduces the continuum flux-level of the stellar SED in the
optical and UV. Due to the time-dependence of this effect, it may help to
distinguish between different ejection mechanisms. Dust, if present, leads to
observable infrared excesses even with low dust-to-gas ratios and traces the
cold material at large distances from the star. By searching for such dust
emission in the WISE catalogue, we found a small number of Algols showing
infrared excesses, among which the two rather surprising objects SX Aur and CZ
Vel. We find that some binary B[e] stars show the same strong Balmer continuum
as we predict with our models. However, direct evidence of systemic mass loss
is probably not observable in genuine Algols, since these systems no longer
eject mass through the hotspot mechanism. Furthermore, owing to its high
velocity, the outflowing material dissipates in a few hundred years. If hot
enough, the hotspot may produce highly ionised species such as SiIV and
observable characteristics that are typical of W Ser systems.

theoretical analysis of the tilted fibre Bragg grating sensor (TFBG) with a
particular focus on its polarization-dependent properties.
  We have developed a highly efficient computer model capable of providing the
full characterization of the TFBG device in less then $3$~minutes for a given
state of incident light polarization. As a result, the polarization-dependent
spectral response, the field distribution at the sensor surface as well as the
fine structure of particular resonances have become accessible for theoretical

full-vector complex mode solver, capable of handling cylindrical waveguides of
an arbitrary complex refractive index profile.
  Along with the theoretical study we have investigated optical properties of
the TFBG sensor with application to polarisation-resolved sensing. We proposed
a new method of the TFBG data analysis based on tracking the grating
transmission spectra along its principle axes, which were extracted from the
Jones matrix.

large variety of sites was found leading to a broad distribution in adsorption
energy at both types of surfaces. Up to 4 % of the sites on the

These artefacts can severely degrade the resulting images and render diffusion

improved least trimmed squares diffusion tensor estimation algorithm that works
well with severely degraded datasets with low signal-to-noise ratio. This
approach has been compared with other diffusion imaging post-processing

avoid this, we modify our first algorithm so that the algorithm needs at most
two projections per iteration. In fact, our computational experience shows that
such cases with two projections are very rare. This scheme, at least
theoretically, seems to be very effective. All methods are shown to be globally
convergent to a solution of the variational inequality. Preliminary results

populations of neurons can represent useful features of the external
environment. However, while neurophysiologists have long been able to record
the responses of neurons in awake, behaving animals, it is another matter
entirely to say what a given neuron does. A key problem is that in many sensory
domains, the space of all possible stimuli that one might encounter is
effectively infinite; in vision, for instance, natural scenes are
combinatorially complex, and an organism will only encounter a tiny fraction of
possible stimuli. As a result, even describing the response properties of
sensory neurons is difficult, and investigations of neuronal functions are
almost always critically limited by the number of stimuli that can be
considered. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop, optimization-based
experimental framework for characterizing the response properties of sensory
neurons, building on past efforts in closed-loop experimental methods, and
leveraging recent advances in artificial neural networks to serve as as a
proving ground for our techniques. Specifically, using deep convolutional
neural networks, we asked whether modern black-box optimization techniques can
be used to interrogate the ""tuning landscape"" of an artificial neuron in a
deep, nonlinear system, without imposing significant constraints on the space
of stimuli under consideration. We introduce a series of measures to quantify
the tuning landscapes, and show how these relate to the performances of the
networks in an object recognition task. To the extent that deep convolutional
neural networks increasingly serve as de facto working hypotheses for
biological vision, we argue that developing a unified approach for studying
both artificial and biological systems holds great potential to advance both
fields together.

related to the speed of propagation of matter-waves as a function of the

quantum transport of non-interacting and weakly-interacting ultracold fermionic
atoms in several 2D optical lattice geometries. We find that the triangular
lattice has a higher propagation velocity compared to the square lattice,
despite supporting longer paths. The body-centered square lattice has even
longer paths, nonetheless the propagation velocity is yet faster. This apparent
paradox arises from the mixing of the momentum states which leads to different
group velocities in quantum systems. Standard band theory provides an
explanation and allows for a systematic way to search and design systems with
controllable matter-wave propagation. Moreover, the presence of a flat band
such as in a two-leg ladder geometry leads to a dynamical density
discontinuity, which contrasts the behavior of mobile and localized atoms in
quantum transport. Our predictions are realizable with present experimental

contributes to the comparison of sampling techniques in complex networks by
means of the first hitting time, that is the minimal time required to reach a

model of the spiking activity in continuous time. For this model the point
process likelihood is concave, such that a global optimum of the parameters can
be obtained by gradient ascent. Previous methods, including those of the same
class, did not allow recurrent networks of that order of magnitude to be
reconstructed due to prohibitive computational cost and numerical
instabilities. We describe a minimal model that is optimized for large networks
and an efficient scheme for its parallelized numerical optimization on generic
computing clusters. For a simulated balanced random network of 1000 neurons,
synaptic connectivity is recovered with a misclassification error rate of less
than 1% under ideal conditions. We show that the error rate remains low in a
series of example cases under progressively less ideal conditions. Finally, we
successfully reconstruct the connectivity of a hidden synfire chain that is
embedded in a random network, which requires clustering of the network
connectivity to reveal the synfire groups. Our results demonstrate how synaptic

a static (metric) sense -- as they coincide only on a set of states of zero

addressing the dynamical relation between these types of non-classicality in a
paradigmatic quantum-optical setting: the linear mixing at a beam splitter of a
single-mode Gaussian state with a thermal reference state. Specifically, we
show that almost all P-classical input states generate outputs that are not
C-classical. Indeed, for the case of zero thermal reference photons, the more
P-classical resources at the input the less C-classicality at the output. In
addition, we show that the P-classicality at the input -- as quantified by the
non-classical depth -- does instead determine quantitatively the potential of
generating output entanglement. This endows the non-classical depth with a new
operational interpretation: it gives the maximum number of thermal reference
photons that can be mixed at a beam splitter without destroying the output
entanglement.

rapidly filled the perfect fluid. However, it is possible to derive a
physically based model which relates interior metric to non-local $f(R)$. The
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations would be a set of first order
differential equations from which we can deduce all mathematical (physical)

However, the quadratic inflation is disfavoured by the new results on
primordial tensor fluctuations from the Planck Collaboration. To be consistent
with the new Planck data, we point out that the explicit symmetry breaking is
needed, and study these two SUGRA inflation in details. For the SUGRA inflation
with global $U(1)$ symmetry, the symmetry breaking term leads to a
trigonometric modulation on inflaton potential. The coefficient of the $U(1)$
symmetry breaking term is of the order $10^{-2}$, which is sufficient large to
improve the inflationary predictions while its higher order corrections are
negligible. Such models predict sizeable tensor fluctuations and highly agree
with the Planck results. In particular, the model with a linear $U(1)$ symmetry
breaking term predicts the tensor-to-scalar ratio around $\textbf{r}\sim0.01$
and running spectral index $\alpha_s\sim-0.004$, which comfortably fit with the
Planck observations. For the SUGRA inflation with breaking shift symmetry, the
inflaton potential is modulated by an exponential factor. The modulated linear

to happen by chance. Taking the standpoint that the Chelyabinsk impactor indeed
separated from 1999 NC43 by a cratering or rotational fission event, we run a
forward probability calculation, which is an independent statistical test.
However, we find this scenario is unlikely at the about (10-3 -10-2) level. We
also verified compositional link between Chelyabinska and 1999NC43.
Mineralogical analysis of Chelyabinsk (LL chondrite) and (8) Flora (the largest
member of the presumed LL chondrite parent family) shows that their olivine and
pyroxene chemistries are similar to LL chondrites. Similar analysis of 1999
NC43 shows that its olivine and pyroxene chemistries are more similar to L
chondrites than LL chondrites (like Chelyabinsk). We also took photometric
observations of 1999 NC43 over 54 nights during two apparitions (2000, 2014).
The lightcurve of 1999 NC43 resembles simulated lightcurves of tumblers in
Short-Axis Mode with the mean wobbling angle 20-30 deg. While, a mechanism of
the non-principal axis rotation excitation is unclear, we can rule out the
formation of asteroid in disruption of its parent body as a plausible cause, as
it is unlikely that the rotation of an asteroid fragment from catastrophic
disruption would be nearly completely halted. Considering all these facts, we
find the proposed link between the Chelyabinsk meteoroid and the asteroid 1999
NC43 to be unlikely.

independent random variates, and adopting empirical distributions for these, we
use Hill's criterion in a statistical way to estimate the planet mass
distribution function from the observed distribution of orbital separations. We
find that the planet mass function is peaked in logarithm of mass, with a peak

radiative heat transfer in terms of the joint density of electronic states of
the emitter-absorber pair in the thermophotovoltaic system. This form reveals
that semiconducting materials with narrowband absorption spectra are critical
to the energy conversion efficiency. This essential feature is unavailable in
conventional bulk semiconductor cells but can be obtained using low dimensional
materials. Our results show that the presence of matched van Hove singularities
resulting from quantum-confinement in the emitter and absorber of a
thermophotovoltaic cell boosts both the magnitude and spectral selectivity of
radiative heat transfer; dramatically improving energy conversion efficiency.
We provide a model near-field thermophotovoltaic system design making use of
this idea by employing the van Hove singularities present in carbon nanotubes.
Shockley-Queisser analysis shows that the predicted heat transfer
characteristics of this model device are fundamentally better than existing
thermophotovoltaic designs. Our work paves the way for the use of quantum dots,

resistance shows equidistant peaks, which are due to classical cyclotron
motion. When the strength of the magnetic field is increased, anomalous
resistance oscillations are observed, similar to those found in a
nonrelativistic 2D electron gas [New. J. Phys. 15:113047 (2013)]. Using a
simplified model, which allows to solve the Dirac equation analytically, the
oscillations are explained by the interference between the occupied edge states
causing beatings in the Hall resistance. A rule of thumb is given for the
experimental observability. Furthermore, the local current flow in graphene is
affected significantly by the boundary geometry. A finite edge current flows on
armchair edges, while the current on zigzag edges vanishes completely. The
quantum Hall staircase can be observed in the case of diffusive boundary
scattering. The number of spatially separated edge channels in the local
current equals the number of occupied Landau levels. The edge channels in the
local density of states are smeared out but can be made visible if only a
subset of the carbon atoms is taken into account.

selectively assemble around the viral RNA amidst diverse host RNAs is a key
question in virology. In one proposed mechanism, sequence elements (packaging
sites) within the genomic RNA promote rapid and efficient assembly through
specific interactions with the capsid proteins. In this work we develop a
coarse-grained particle-based computational model for capsid proteins and RNA

depend on solution conditions (which control protein-protein and nonspecific
protein-RNA interactions) as well as the strength and number of packaging
sites. We identify distinct regions in parameter space in which packaging sites
lead to highly specific assembly via different mechanisms, and others in which
packaging sites lead to kinetic traps. We relate these computational
predictions to in vitro assays for specificity in which cognate viral RNAs are
compete against non-cognate RNAs for assembly by capsid proteins.

probabilistic quantum channels or general quantum operations by specifying a
set of input states or a state ensemble. However, it remains open how much
excess noise on canonical variables is unavoidable and whether there exists a
fundamental trade-off relation between the canonical pair in a general
amplification process. In this paper we present an uncertainty-product form of
amplification limits for general quantum operations by assuming an input
ensemble of Gaussian distributed coherent states. It can be derived as a
straightforward consequence of canonical uncertainty relations and retrieves
basic properties of the traditional amplification limit. In addition, our
amplification limit turns out to give a physical limitation on probabilistic
reduction of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen uncertainty. In this regard, we find a
condition that probabilistic amplifiers can be regarded as local filtering
operations to distill entanglement. This condition establishes a clear
benchmark to verify an advantage of non-Gaussian operations beyond Gaussian
operations with a feasible input set of coherent states and standard homodyne
measurements.

stochastic differential equations (SDEs) arising in mathematical finance,

fluids. These schemes are obtained by spatially discretizing the Kolmogorov
equation associated with the SDE in such a way that the resulting semi-discrete
equation generates a Markov jump process that can be realized exactly using a
Monte Carlo method. In this construction the spatial increment of the
approximation can be bounded uniformly in space, which guarantees that the
schemes are numerically stable for both finite and long time simulation of
SDEs. By directly analyzing the generator of the approximation, we prove that
the approximation has a sharp stochastic Lyapunov function when applied to an
SDE with a drift field that is locally Lipschitz continuous and weakly
dissipative. We use this stochastic Lyapunov function to extend a local
semimartingale representation of the approximation. This extension permits to
analyze the complexity of the approximation. Using the theory of semigroups of
linear operators on Banach spaces, we show that the approximation is (weakly)
accurate in representing finite and infinite-time statistics, with an order of
accuracy identical to that of its generator. The proofs are carried out in the
context of both fixed and variable spatial step sizes. Theoretical and
numerical studies confirm these statements, and provide evidence that these
schemes have several advantages over standard methods based on
time-discretization. In particular, they are accurate, eliminate nonphysical
moves in simulating SDEs with boundaries (or confined domains), prevent
exploding trajectories from occurring when simulating stiff SDEs, and solve
first exit problems without time-interpolation errors.

KOI hosts are observed over ~20 epochs at a radial velocity precision of
100-200 m/s. These observations can easily identify a majority of false
positives caused by physically-associated stellar or substellar binaries, and
in many cases, fully characterize their orbits. We demonstrate that APOGEE is
capable of achieving RV precision at the 100-200 m/s level over long time
baselines, and that APOGEE's multiplexing capability makes it substantially
more efficient at identifying false positives due to binaries than other
single-object spectrographs working to confirm KOIs as planets. These APOGEE
RVs enable ancillary science projects, such as studies of fundamental stellar
astrophysics or intrinsically rare substellar companions. The coadded APOGEE

fluctuations. Understanding the energy and elastic behaviour of a lipid-bilayer
edge is crucial for controlling the formation and growth of such pores. In the
present work, the interactions in the molecular level are used to obtain the
free energy of the edge of an open lipid bilayer. The resulted free-energy
density includes terms associated with flexural and torsional energies of the
edge, in addition to a line-tension contribution. The line tension, elastic
moduli, and spontaneous normal and geodesic curvatures of the edge are obtained
as functions of molecular distribution, molecular dimensions, cutoff distance,
and the interaction strength. These parameters are further analyzed by
implementing a soft-core interaction potential in the microphysical model. The
dependence of the elastic free-energy of the edge to the size of the pore is
reinvestigated through an illustrative example, and the results are found to be
in agreement with the previous observations.

sequencing (NGS) reads is highly essential in several applications such as
prediction of genomic variants or protein binding motifs located in repeat
regions, isoform expression quantification, metagenomics analysis, etc.
However, this task is very time-consuming and majority of mapping tools only
focus on one or a few best mapping locations. Results: We propose AMAS, an
alignment tool specialized in identifying all possible mapping locations of NGS
reads in a reference sequence. AMAS features an effective use of adaptive seeds
to speed up read mapping while preserving sensitivity. Specifically, an index
is designed to pre-store the locations of adaptive seeds in the reference
sequence, efficiently reducing the time for seed matching and partitioning. An
accurate filtration of adaptive seeds is further applied to substantially
tighten the candidate alignment space. As a result, AMAS runs several times
faster than other state-of-the-art read mappers while achieving similar
accuracy. Conclusions: AMAS provides a valuable resource to speed up the
important yet time-consuming task of identifying all mapping locations of NGS
reads. AMAS is implemented in C++ based on the SeqAn library and is freely

the generalized Chaplygin gas, two-term energy density, trinomial Friedmann,
Born--Infeld, and two-fluid models. We show that some of these may be

but may be integrated explicitly by other methods. With the explicit
integration, we are able to understand exactly the roles of the physical
parameters in various models play in the cosmological evolution. For example,
in the Chaplygin gas universe, it is seen that, as far as there is a tiny
presence of nonlinear matter, linear matter makes contribution to the dark
matter, which becomes significant near the phantom divide line. The Friedmann
equations also arise in areas of physics not directly related to cosmology. We
provide some examples ranging from geometric optics and central orbits to soap

between the mass of the central supermassive black holes (BHs) and properties
of the host galaxies, notably the stellar bulge mass or central stellar
velocity dispersion. Motivated by these correlations, the theoretical paradigm
has emerged, in which BHs and bulges co-evolve. However, this picture was
challenged by observational and theoretical studies, which hinted that the
fundamental connection may be between BHs and dark matter halos, and not
necessarily with their host galaxies. Based on a study of 3130 elliptical
galaxies $-$ selected from the Sloan Digital and ROSAT All Sky Surveys $-$ we
demonstrate that the central stellar velocity dispersion exhibits a
significantly tighter correlation with the total gravitating mass, traced by
the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas, than with the stellar mass. This hints
that the central stellar velocity dispersion, and hence the central
gravitational potential, may be the fundamental property of elliptical galaxies
that is most tightly connected to the larger-scale dark matter halo.
Furthermore, using the central stellar velocity dispersion as a surrogate for
the BH mass, we find that in elliptical galaxies the inferred BH mass and
inferred total gravitating mass within the virial radius (or within five
effective radii) can be expressed as $M_{\rm{BH}} \propto M_{\rm
tot}^{1.6^{+0.6}_{-0.4}} $ (or $M_{\rm{BH}} \propto
M_{\rm{5r_{eff}}}^{1.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6}}$). These results are consistent with a
picture in which the BH mass is directly set by the central stellar velocity
dispersion, which, in turn, is determined by the total gravitating mass of the

based on using galaxy auto-correlation. We make use of realistic simulated
galaxy catalogues that have been constructed by populating simulated dark
matter haloes with galaxies through halo occupation prescriptions. We adapt the
classical RSD dispersion model to the case of the group-galaxy
cross-correlation function and estimate the RSD parameter $\beta$ by fitting
both the full anisotropic correlation function $\xi(r_p,\pi)$ and its multipole
moments. In addition, we define a modified version of the latter statistics by
truncating the multipole moments to exclude strongly non-linear distortions at
small transverse scales. We fit these three observable quantities in our set of
simulated galaxy catalogues and estimate statistical and systematic errors on
$\beta$ for the case of galaxy-galaxy, group-group, and group-galaxy
correlation functions. When ignoring off-diagonal elements of the covariance
matrix in the fitting, the truncated multipole moments of the group-galaxy
cross-correlation function provide the most accurate estimate, with systematic
errors below 3% when fitting transverse scales larger than $10Mpc/h$. Including
the full data covariance enlarges statistical errors but keep unchanged the
level of systematic error. Although statistical errors are generally larger for
groups, the use of group-galaxy cross-correlation can potentially allow the
reduction of systematics while using simple linear or dispersion models.

the circumprimary disc, during the merger of a supermassive black hole binary.
As the binary orbital decay speeds up due to the emission of gravitational
waves, the gas in the circumprimary disc might be forced to accrete rapidly and
could in principle provide a significant electromagnetic counterpart to the
gravitational wave emission. Since the luminosity of such flare is proportional
to the gaseous mass in the circumprimary disc, estimating such mass accurately
is important. Previous investigations of this issue have produced contradictory
results, with some authors estimating super-Eddington flares and large disc
mass, while others suggesting that the ""fossil"" disc mass is very low, even
less than a Jupiter mass. Here, we perform simple 1D calculations to show that
such very low estimates of the disc mass are an artifact of the specific
implementation of the tidal torque in 1D models. In particular, for moderate
mass ratios of the binary, the usual formula for the torque used in 1D models
significantly overestimates the width of the gap induced by the secondary and
this artificially leads to a very small leftover circumprimary disc. Using a
modified torque, calibrated to reproduce the correct gap width as estimated by
3D models, leads to fossil disc masses of the order of one solar mass. The
rapid accretion of the whole circumprimary disc would produce peak luminosities
of the order of 1-20 times the Eddington luminosity. Even if a significant
fraction of the gas escapes accretion by flowing out the secondary orbit during
the merger (an effect not included in our calculations), we would still predict
close to Eddington luminosities that might be easily detected.

astrophysical outcomes ranging from faint thermonuclear and Type Ia supernovae
to the formation of neutron stars and stably accreting AM Canum Venaticorum
systems. One key factor affecting the final outcome is whether mass transfer
remains dynamically stable or instead diverges, leading to the tidal disruption
of the donor and the merger of the binary. It is typically thought that for low
ratios of the donor mass to the accretor mass, mass transfer remains stable,
especially if accretion occurs via a disk. In this Letter, we examine low mass
ratio double white dwarf binaries and find that the initial phase of
hydrogen-rich mass transfer leads to a classical nova-like outburst on the
accretor. Dynamical friction within the expanding nova shell shrinks the orbit
and causes the mass transfer rate to increase dramatically above the accretor's
Eddington limit, possibly resulting in a binary merger. If the binary survives
the first hydrogen-rich nova outbursts, dynamical friction within the
subsequent helium-powered nova shells pushes the system even more strongly
towards merger. While further calculations are necessary to confirm this
outcome for the entire range of binaries previously thought to be dynamically
stable, it appears likely that most, if not all, interacting double white dwarf

in evolution [PNAS'14]. In short, the theory suggests that the evolutionary
process of gene recombination implements the celebrated multiplicative weights
updates algorithm (MWUA). They prove that the population dynamics induced by
sexual reproduction can be precisely modeled by genes that use MWUA as their
learning strategy in a particular coordination game. The result holds in the
environments of \emph{weak selection}, under the assumption that the population
frequencies remain a product distribution.
  We revisit the theory, eliminating both the requirement of weak selection and
any assumption on the distribution of the population. Removing the assumption
of product distributions is crucial, since as we show, this assumption is
inconsistent with the population dynamics. We show that the marginal allele
distributions induced by the population dynamics precisely match the marginals
induced by a multiplicative weights update algorithm in this general setting,
thereby affirming and substantially generalizing these earlier results.
  We further revise the implications for convergence and utility or fitness
guarantees in coordination games. In contrast to the claim of Chastain et
al.[PNAS'14], we conclude that the sexual evolutionary dynamics does not entail
any property of the population distribution, beyond those already implied by
convergence.

tree-level, replacing Feynman diagrams with recursion relations and interaction
vertices with a handful of seed scattering amplitudes. In this paper we
determine the simplest recursion relations needed to construct a general
four-dimensional quantum field theory of massless particles. For this purpose
we define a covering space of recursion relations which naturally generalizes
all existing constructions, including those of BCFW and Risager. The validity
of each recursion relation hinges on the large momentum behavior of an n-point
scattering amplitude under an m-line momentum shift, which we determine solely
from dimensional analysis, Lorentz invariance, and locality. We show that all
amplitudes in a renormalizable theory are 5-line constructible. Amplitudes are
3-line constructible if an external particle carries spin or if the scalars in
the theory carry equal charge under a global or gauge symmetry. Remarkably,
this implies the 3-line constructibility of all gauge theories with fermions
and complex scalars in arbitrary representations, all supersymmetric theories,
and the standard model. Moreover, all amplitudes in non-renormalizable theories
without derivative interactions are constructible; with derivative
interactions, a subset of amplitudes is constructible. We illustrate our
results with examples from both renormalizable and non-renormalizable theories.
Our study demonstrates both the power and limitations of recursion relations as
a self-contained formulation of quantum field theory.

Markov chain derived from a random walk on the graph and thus they cannot take
advantage of important higher-order network substructures such as triangles,
cycles, and feed-forward loops. Here we propose a Tensor Spectral Clustering
(TSC) algorithm that allows for modeling higher-order network structures in a
graph partitioning framework. Our TSC algorithm allows the user to specify
which higher-order network structures (cycles, feed-forward loops, etc.) should
be preserved by the network clustering. Higher-order network structures of
interest are represented using a tensor, which we then partition by developing
a multilinear spectral method. Our framework can be applied to discovering
layered flows in networks as well as graph anomaly detection, which we
illustrate on synthetic networks. In directed networks, a higher-order
structure of particular interest is the directed 3-cycle, which captures
feedback loops in networks. We demonstrate that our TSC algorithm produces
large partitions that cut fewer directed 3-cycles than standard spectral
clustering algorithms.

a diagnostic. Based on X-ray spectra extracted from an extensive set of Suzaku
observations, we measure the energy centroid shifts of the triplet on and off

emission exists throughout much of the rim and this enhancement azimuthally
correlates with non-radiative H{\alpha} filaments, a tracer of strong
neutral-plasma interaction in the optical. We also show that alternative
mechanisms cannot explain the enhancement observed. These results demonstrate
the need to model the CX contribution to the X-ray emission of SNRs,

tomography allows to resolve three-dimensional variations of an unknown

propagation of the transmitted wave field, this method is sensitive not only to
absorption but also to refractive phase shifts induced by the specimen,
permitting three-dimensional nanoscale imaging of quasi-transparent samples

from the observed data constitutes an algorithmically challenging nonlinear
ill-posed inverse problem, mainly due to the characteristic loss of phase
information in the detection of the wave field.
  In this work, regularized Newton methods are developed for the solution of
this tomographic phase retrieval problem, based on a detailed analysis of its
mathematical structure. We consider both the near-field- or Fresnel regime
characterized by a moderate propagation length between sample and detector and
the far-field limit of large detector distances, where propagation is governed
by the Fourier transform. In the former setting, excellent numerical
reconstructions are obtained via the chosen Newton-type approach, supplemented
by novel theoretical results stating that measurements from a single detector
distance are sufficient to uniquely recover both refraction and absorption of a

correlations between the diffraction patterns recorded under different incident

be defined for the original system under consideration. The notion of a
trajectory attractor was previously established for a system without uniqueness
by considering a family of auxiliary systems including the original one. In

the electroluminescence in a certain frequency window. We demonstrate that the
tunneling of Cooper pairs induces an additional luminescence peak on resonance.
There is a transfer of superconducting to photonic coherence which results in
the emission of entangled photon pairs and squeezing of the fluctuations in the
quadrature amplitudes of the emitted light. The squeezing angle can be
electrically manipulated by changing the relative phase of the order parameters
in the superconductors. We finally derive the conditions for lasing in the

topological phases with fractionalized quasiparticles have attracted intense
attentions in the past twenty years. Theoretically, it is possible to realize a
rich variety of such states by coupling two Abelian fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) states together through gapping out part of the low energy degrees of
freedom. So far, there are some indications, but no robust example has been
established in bilayer systems for realizing the non-Abelian state in the past.
Here, we present a phase diagram of a double-layer bosonic FQH system based on
the exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
calculations, which demonstrate a potential regime with the emergence of the
non-Abelian bosonic Moore-Read state. We start from the Abelian phase with
fourfold topological degeneracies on torus geometry when the two layers are
weakly coupled. With the increase of interlayer tunneling, we find an
intermediate regime with a threefold groundstate degeneracy and a finite
fractional drag Hall conductance. We find the different topological sectors in
consistent with Moore-Read state by inserting different fluxes in adiabatic
DMRG study. We also extract the modular $\mathcal{S}-$ matrix, which supports
the emergence of the non-Abelian Ising anyon quasiparticle in this system.

peroxy defects have been widely overlooked in the past. The charge carriers of
interest are positive holes, chemically equivalent to O$^-$ in a matrix of
O$^{2-}$, physically defect electrons in the O$^{2-}$ sublattice, highly
mobile, able to propagate fast and far. O$^-$ are oxidized relative to
O$^{2-}$. As such O$^-$ are not supposed to exist in minerals and rocks that
come from deep within the Earth crust or upper mantle, where the environments
are overwhelmingly reduced. In order to understand how peroxy defects are
introduced, we look at peroxy defects in a crystallographically and
compositionally well characterized model system: single crystals of nominally
high-purity MgO, grown from the melt under highly reducing conditions. During
crystallization the MgO crystals incorporate OH$^-$ through dissolution of
traces of H$_2$O into the MgO matrix, leading to a solid solution (ss)
Mg$_{1-\delta}$(OH)$_{2\delta}$O$_{1-2\delta}$, where $\delta$ <1. During
cooling, ss turns into a metastable supersaturated solid solution (sss). During
further cooling, OH$^-$ pairs at Mg$^{2+}$ vacancy sites rearrange their
electrons, undergoing a redox conversion, which leads to peroxy anions,
O$_2^{2-}$, plus molecular H$_2$. Being diffusively mobile, the H$_2$ can leave
their Mg$^{2+}$ vacancy sites, leaving behind cation-deficient
Mg$_{1-\delta}$O. During reheating O$_2^{2-}$ break up, releasing positive hole
charge carriers, which affect the electrical conductivity behavior. In rocks,
similar changes in the electrical conductivity are observed in the temperature
window, where peroxy defects of the type O$_3$Si-OO-SiO$_3$ break up. They
release positive holes, which control the electrical conductivity response
along the geotherm.

small scales. Wave prediction also emphasizes that small scale turbulence in
meteorological forces can increase error in predictions up to 35%. Wave
frequency and coherence analysis showed that both models are able to reveal the

within 0.6 sigma when we re-computed the Planck value assuming a two component

subclusters will undergo core passage in 500 +- 200 Myr. The northern
subcluster is centrally peaked and has a low entropy core, while the southern

subcluster can be explained either by the mergers of several groups, as
suggested by the presence of five giant ellipticals or by AGN energy injection,
as suggested by the presence of a strong radio source in one of its massive
elliptical galaxies, or by a combination of both processes.

then allows threads to run in parallel, so long as results remain consistent

  Programmers benefit because they can reason largely sequentially. Remaining
interthread interactions are far less chaotic than in other models, permitting
easier reasoning and debugging. Programmers can also defer the choice of
concurrency-control mechanism (e.g., locks or transactions) until after they
have written their programs, at which point they can compare

susceptibility constraint -- susceptible nodes are infected by their neighbors
via the regular SI/SIS dynamics, but subject to a cap on the infection rate.
Such a constraint is motivated by modern social networks, wherein messages are
broadcast to all neighbors, but attention spans are limited. Bounded
susceptibility also arises in distributed computing applications with download
bandwidth constraints, and in human epidemics under quarantine policies.
  Network epidemics have been extensively studied in literature; prior work
characterizes the graph structures required to ensure fast spreading under the
SI dynamics, and long lifetime under the SIS dynamics. In particular, these
conditions turn out to be meaningful for two classes of networks of practical
relevance -- dense, uniform (i.e., clique-like) graphs, and sparse, structured
(i.e., star-like) graphs. We show that bounded susceptibility has a surprising
impact on epidemic behavior in these graph families. For the SI dynamics,
bounded susceptibility has no effect on star-like networks, but dramatically
alters the spreading time in clique-like networks. In contrast, for the SIS
dynamics, clique-like networks are unaffected, but star-like networks exhibit a
sharp change in extinction times under bounded susceptibility.
  Our findings are useful for the design of disease-resistant networks and
infrastructure networks. More generally, they show that results for existing
epidemic models are sensitive to modeling assumptions in non-intuitive ways,
and suggest caution in directly using these as guidelines for real systems.

not straightforward as the system becomes larger. We show that the fully

shifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the
exact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in
the dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important
barrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions
following planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this
degeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly
interacting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce
swift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of
planetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive
disks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets,
we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune
masses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass
of Saturn. The inner two planets' masses are unconstrained by dynamical

evidence that the relative per volume/mass unit respiration decreases with
increase of tree body size. In this study, based on the available data
published a question was explored if the relative per area unit respiration in
trees can be a constant, independent of the surface area size. There is a
definite gap in the published data when the allometric studies of tree body
structure do not intercept with studies on trees respiration. Thus the question
was studied with the help of indirect comparison between various data. The
comparison showed that the scaling exponents, volume vs. surface area and
respiration vs. stem volume, are slightly larger than they should be for the
hypothesis of the relative respiration constancy to hold. The data studied give
evidence that the relative per area unit respiration slightly increases with
the increase in tree surface area. Possible explanations of the relationship
include a different distribution of metabolically active parts of stem and
higher nitrogen content in larger trees. Also, the published datasets might
include large fast growing trees, which imply that larger trees grow faster and
hence have higher per unit surface area growth respiration. A crucial
experiment is required in which the respiration measurements were performed for
the same data as the measurements of scaling between stem volume and surface
area.

the linear propagating motion away from the Sun, the expanding and the poloidal

our statistics, about 62\%/17\% of MCs underwent a under/over-expansion at 1 AU

fault (GSF) energies, dislocation core structures and the strain field of an
oxygen interstitial. Compared with the substitutional atoms such as Al, there
is a large repulsive interaction between oxygen interstitials at the octahedral
site and an <a>-type screw dislocation core, since the volume for the
interstitial atom between Ti lattice sites is largely reduced in the core.
Differential displacement maps and distributions of interstitial volume
surrounding the dislocation core show that the interaction with an oxygen
interstitial is very short ranged (~ 5 Angstrom) and directional, mainly
located on the prismatic plane where the majority of lattice displacements in
the <a> screw dislocation core occurs. At long distances the interactions
mediated by the strain from the interstitial oxygen and the dislocation vanish.
We show that the large repulsive interaction at short range can push an oxygen
atom from its original interstitial site to a new interstitial site on the
basal plane in the dislocation core. The strong repulsive interaction and the
mechanical shuffle of oxygen interstitials can be expected to have a large
impact on dislocation dynamics, and can be used to explain the strong
strengthening effects of oxygen impurities in alpha-titanium observed
experimentally.

evoke them in listeners. In consequence, the past decade witnessed a growing
interest in modeling emotions from musical signals in the music information
retrieval (MIR) community. In this article, we present a novel generative
approach to music emotion modeling, with a specific focus on the
valence-arousal (VA) dimension model of emotion. The presented generative
model, called \emph{acoustic emotion Gaussians} (AEG), better accounts for the
subjectivity of emotion perception by the use of probability distributions.
Specifically, it learns from the emotion annotations of multiple subjects a
Gaussian mixture model in the VA space with prior constraints on the
corresponding acoustic features of the training music pieces. Such a
computational framework is technically sound, capable of learning in an online
fashion, and thus applicable to a variety of applications, including
user-independent (general) and user-dependent (personalized) emotion
recognition and emotion-based music retrieval. We report evaluations of the
aforementioned applications of AEG on a larger-scale emotion-annotated corpora,
AMG1608, to demonstrate the effectiveness of AEG and to showcase how
evaluations are conducted for research on emotion-based MIR. Directions of
future work are also discussed.

Ly$\alpha$ emission by adding fake nebulosities into the datacubes and trying
to recover them after PSF subtraction. Our observations are consistent with
other studies showing that giant Ly$\alpha$ nebulae such as those found
recently around some quasars are very rare. Ly$\alpha$ fuzz around typical
radio-quiet QSOs is fainter, less extended and is therefore much harder to
detect. The faintness of these structures is consistent with the idea that
radio-quiet QSOs typically reside in dark matter haloes of modest masses.

two different modals of data, i.e., an image and a text. Cross-modal factor
analysis (CFA) has been proposed to project the two different modals of data to
a shared data space, so that the classification of a image or a text can be
performed directly in this space. A disadvantage of CFA is that it has ignored
the supervision information. In this paper, we improve CFA by incorporating the
supervision information to represent and classify both image and text modals of
documents. We project both image and text data to a shared data space by factor
analysis, and then train a class label predictor in the shared space to use the
class label information. The factor analysis parameter and the predictor
parameter are learned jointly by solving one single objective function. With
this objective function, we minimize the distance between the projections of
image and text of the same document, and the classification error of the
projection measured by hinge loss function. The objective function is optimized
by an alternate optimization strategy in an iterative algorithm. Experiments in
two different multiple modal document data sets show the advantage of the
proposed algorithm over other CFA methods.

heat $C(T,H)$, a temperature-magnetic field ($T$-$H$) phase diagram has been
established for GdCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$AsO ($x = 0$ and $0.05$) polycrystalline
compounds. GdCoAsO undergoes two long-range magnetic transitions: ferromagnetic
(FM) transition of Co $3d$ electrons ($T_\textup{C}^\textup{Co}$) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of Gd $4f$ electrons
($T_\textup{N}^\textup{Gd}$). For the Fe-doped sample ($x=0.05$), an extra
magnetic reorientation transition takes place below $T_\textup{N}^\textup{Gd}$,
which is likely associated with Co moments. The two magnetic species of Gd and
Co are coupled antiferromagnetically to give rise to ferrimagnetic (FIM)
behavior in the magnetic susceptibility. Upon decreasing the temperature ($T <
T_\textup{C}^\textup{Co}$), the magnetocrystalline anisotropy breaks up the FM
order of Co by aligning the moments with the local easy axes of the various
grains, leading to a spin reorientation transition at
$T_\textup{R}^\textup{Co}$. By applying a magnetic field,

population-based algorithms have demonstrated ability to decode the key during

heuristics, erroneous information, group key exchange, synaptic depths, etc,

that discovery of neural architectures with very high synchronization speed,

a hot plasma fireball will form after the material of the small body penetrates
into the neutron star surface. The ionized matter inside the fireball will then
expand along the magnetic field lines. Coherent radiation from the thin shell
at the top of the fireball will account for the observed FRBs. Our scenario can
reasonably explain the main features of FRBs, such as their durations,
luminosities, and the event rate. We argue that for a single neutron star, FRBs
are not likely to happen repeatedly in a forseeable time span since such
impacts are of low probability. We predict that faint remnant X-ray emissions
should be associated with FRBs, but it may be too faint to be detected by

variety of collective dynamical events such as network spikes, UP and DOWN
states, global oscillations, and avalanches. Though each of them have been
variously recognized in previous works as expressions of the excitability of
the cortical tissue and the associated nonlinear dynamics, a unified picture of
their determinant factors (dynamical and architectural) is desirable and not
yet available. Progress has also been partially hindered by the use of a
variety of statistical measures to define the network events of interest. We
propose here a common probabilistic definition of network events that, applied
to the firing activity of cultured neural networks, highlights the
co-occurrence of network spikes, power-law distributed avalanches, and
exponentially distributed `quasi-orbits', which offer a third type of
collective behavior. A rate model, including synaptic excitation and inhibition
with no imposed topology, synaptic short-term depression, and finite-size
noise, accounts for all these different, coexisting phenomena. We find that
their emergence is largely regulated by the proximity to an oscillatory
instability of the dynamics, where the non-linear excitable behavior leads to a
self-amplification of activity fluctuations over a wide range of scales in
space and time. In this sense, the cultured network dynamics is compatible with
an excitation-inhibition balance corresponding to a slightly sub-critical
regime. Finally, we propose and test a method to infer the characteristic time
of the fatigue process, from the observed time course of the network's firing
rate. Unlike the model, possessing a single fatigue mechanism, the cultured
network appears to show multiple time scales, signalling the possible
coexistence of different fatigue mechanisms.

illustrated by deep spectroscopy of three nebulae with a post common-envelope
(CE) binary star. Abell 46 and Ou5 have O++/H+ abundance discrepancy factors
larger than 50, and as high as 300 in the inner regions of Abell 46. Abell 63
has a smaller discrepancy factor around 10, but still above the typical values
in ionized nebulae. Our spectroscopic analysis supports previous conclusions
that, in addition to ""standard"" hot (Te~10000 K) gas, a colder (Te~1000 K)
ionized component that is highly enriched in heavy elements also exists. These
nebulae have low ionized masses, between 0.001 and 0.1 solar masses depending
on the adopted electron densities and temperatures. Since the much more massive
red-giant envelope is expected to be entirely ejected in the CE phase, the
currently observed nebulae would be produced much later, in post-CE mass loss
episodes when the envelope has already dispersed. These observations add
constraints to the abundance discrepancy problem. Possible explanations are
revised. Some are naturally linked to binarity, such as for instance
high-metallicity nova ejecta, but it is difficult at this stage to depict an
evolutionary scenario consistent with all the observed properties. The
hypothesis that these nebulae are the result of tidal destruction, accretion
and ejection of Jupiter-like planets is also introduced.

useful when implemented over asynchronous, typically large, message-passing
distributed systems. Fault tolerant design is a key criterion for the success
of such implementations. This is because large distributed systems can be
highly available as long as they do not depend on the full operational status
of every system participant. Namely, they employ redundancy in numbers to
overcome non-optimal behavior of participants and to gain global robustness and
high availability.
  Self-stabilizing systems can tolerate transient faults that drive the system
to an arbitrary unpredicted configuration. Such systems automatically regain
consistency from any such arbitrary configuration, and then produce the desired
system behavior. Practically self-stabilizing systems ensure the desired system
behavior for practically infinite number of successive steps e.g., $2^{64}$
steps.
  We present the first practically self-stabilizing virtual synchrony
algorithm. The algorithm is a combination of several new techniques that may be
of independent interest. In particular, we present a new counter algorithm that
establishes an efficient practically unbounded counter, that in turn can be
directly used to implement a self-stabilizing Multiple-Writer Multiple-Reader
(MWMR) register emulation. Other components include self-stabilizing group
membership, self-stabilizing multicast, and self-stabilizing emulation of
replicated state machine. As we base the replicated state machine
implementation on virtual synchrony, rather than consensus, the system
progresses in more extreme asynchronous executions in relation to
consensus-based replicated state machine.

evolution of the genetic composition of a population under recombination and
resampling. There are $n$ sites (or loci), a finite number of letters (or
alleles) at every site, and we do not make any scaling assumptions. In
particular, we do not assume a diffusion limit. We consider the following
marginal ancestral recombination process. Let $S = \{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal
A=\{A_1, ..., A_m\}$ be a partition of $S$. We concentrate on the joint
probability of the letters at the sites in $A_1$ in individual $1$, $...$, and
at the sites in $A_m$ in individual $m$, where the individuals are sampled from
the current population without replacement. Following the ancestry of these
sites backwards in time yields a process on the set of partitions of $S$,
which, in the diffusion limit, turns into a marginalised version of the
$n$-locus ancestral recombination graph. With the help of an
inclusion-exclusion principle, we show that the type distribution corresponding

so-called recombinators and sampling functions. The same is true of correlation
functions (known as linkage disequilibria in genetics) of all orders.
  We prove that the partitioning process (backward in time) is dual to the
Moran population process (forward in time), where the sampling function plays
the role of the duality function. This sheds new light on the work of
Bobrowski, Wojdyla, and Kimmel (2010). The result also leads to a closed system

structure. In such materials, the valley index is being considered as an
information carrier. Consequently, relaxation mechanisms leading to loss of
valley information are of interest. Here, we calculate the rate of valley
relaxation induced by charged impurities in graphene. A special model of
graphene is applied, where the $p_z$ orbitals are two-dimensional Gaussian
functions, with a spatial extension characterised by an effective Bohr radius
$a_\textrm{eB}$. We obtain the valley relaxation rate by solving the Boltzmann
equation, for the case of noninteracting electrons, as well as for the case
when the impurity potential is screened due to electron-electron interaction.
For the latter case, we take into account local-field effects and evaluate the
dielectric matrix in the random phase approximation. Our main findings: (i) The
valley relaxation rate is proportional to the electronic density of states at
the Fermi energy. (ii) Charged impurities located in the close vicinity of the
graphene plane, at distance $d \lesssim 0.3\,\textrm{\AA}$, are much more
efficient in inducing valley relaxation than those farther away, the effect of
the latter being suppressed exponentially with increasing graphene-impurity
distance $d$. (iii) Both in the absence and in the presence of
electron-electron interaction, the valley relaxation rate shows pronounced
dependence on the effective Bohr radius $a_\textrm{eB}$. The trends are
different in the two cases: in the absence (presence) of screening, the valley
relaxation rate decreases (increases) for increasing effective Bohr radius.
This last result highlights that a quantitative calculation of the valley
relaxation rate should incorporate electron-electron interactions as well as an
accurate knowledge of the electronic wave functions on the atomic length scale.

deals with the orthographic SfS problem based on the Lambertian reflectance
model, the most common and simplest model which leads to an eikonal type
equation when the light source is on the vertical axis. In this paper we want
to study non-Lambertian models since they are more realistic and suitable
whenever one has to deal with different kind of surfaces, rough or specular. We
will present a unified mathematical formulation of some popular orthographic
non-Lambertian models, considering vertical and oblique light directions as
well as different viewer positions. These models lead to more complex
stationary nonlinear partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi type
which can be regarded as the generalization of the classical eikonal equation
corresponding to the Lambertian case. However, all the equations corresponding
to the models considered here (Oren-Nayar and Phong) have a similar structure
so we can look for weak solutions to this class in the viscosity solution
framework. Via this unified approach, we are able to develop a semi-Lagrangian

detector with a total (fiducial) mass of 0.99 (0.56) million metric tons,
approximately 20 (25) times larger than that of Super-Kamiokande. One of the
main goals of Hyper-Kamiokande is the study of $CP$ asymmetry in the lepton
sector using accelerator neutrino and anti-neutrino beams.
  In this paper, the physics potential of a long baseline neutrino experiment
using the Hyper-Kamiokande detector and a neutrino beam from the J-PARC proton
synchrotron is presented. The analysis uses the framework and systematic
uncertainties derived from the ongoing T2K experiment. With a total exposure of
7.5 MW $\times$ 10$^7$ sec integrated proton beam power (corresponding to
$1.56\times10^{22}$ protons on target with a 30 GeV proton beam) to a
$2.5$-degree off-axis neutrino beam, it is expected that the leptonic $CP$
phase $\delta_{CP}$ can be determined to better than 19 degrees for all
possible values of $\delta_{CP}$, and $CP$ violation can be established with a
statistical significance of more than $3\,\sigma$ ($5\,\sigma$) for $76\%$
($58\%$) of the $\delta_{CP}$ parameter space. Using both $\nu_e$ appearance
and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance data, the expected 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of
$\sin^2\theta_{23}$ is 0.015(0.006) for $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.5(0.45)$.

was studied that can perform unidirectional rotations induced by linearly
polarized ac fields, and produce positive work under loads. The model is based
on the Langevin equation for a particle in a two-dimensional (2D) three-tooth
ratchet potential of threefold symmetry. The performance of the system is
characterized by the coercive torque, i.e., the strength of the load competing
with the torque induced by the ac driving field, and the energy efficiency in
force conversion from the driving field to torque. We propose a master equation
for coarse-grained states, which takes into account boundary motion between
states, and develop a kinetic description to estimate mean angular momentum
(MAM) and powers relevant to the energy balance equation. The framework of
analysis incorporates several 2D characteristics, and is applicable to a wide
class of models of smooth 2D ratchet potential. We confirm that the obtained
expressions for MAM, power, and efficiency of the model can predict qualitative
behaviors. We also discuss the usefulness of the torque/power relationship for
experimental analyses, and propose a characteristic for 2D ratchet systems.

  appearing on the electronic Journal",,"10.1093/mnras/stv357",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have studied the effects of various initial mass functions (IMFs) on the
chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). In particular, we
tested the effects of the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) on
various predicted abundance patterns. The IGIMF depends on the star formation
rate and metallicity and predicts less massive stars in a regime of low star
formation, as it is the case in dwarf spheroidals. We adopted a detailed
chemical evolution model following the evolution of $\alpha$-elements, Fe and
Eu, and assuming the currently best set of stellar yields. We also explored
different yield prescriptions for the Eu, including production from neutron
star mergers. Although the uncertainties still present in the stellar yields
and data prevent us from drawing firm conclusions, our results suggest that the
IGIMF applied to Sgr predicts lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios than classical IMFs
and lower [hydrostatic/explosive] $\alpha$-element ratios, in qualitative
agreement with observations. In our model, the observed high [Eu/O] ratios in
Sgr is due to reduced O production, resulting from the IGIMF mass cutoff of the
massive oxygen-producing stars, as well as to the Eu yield produced in neutron
star mergers, a more promising site than core-collapse supernovae, although
many uncertainties are still present in the Eu nucleosynthesis. We find that a
model, similar to our previous calculations, based on the late addition of iron
from the Type Ia supernova time-delay (necessary to reproduce the shape of
[X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations) but also including the reduction of massive
stars due to the IGIMF, better reproduces the observed abundance ratios in Sgr
than models without the IGIMF.

orbital solution after removing the two main contributions to the stellar
jitter, one that varies with the photometric period and another that varies
with the synodic period of the star+planet system. We use a new method to
determine these jitter components, considering them as a second and third
signals in the system. A discussion on possible magnetic
star-planet-interaction is included, based on the Bayesian analysis of the
activity indices. We propose two possible sources for flare events of this
star: one related to the geometry of the system and the relative movement of
the star+planet, and a second one purely stochastic source that is related to
the evolution of stellar active regions. Also, we observe for the first time
the magnetic field of the star, from spectropolarimetric data.

structures of ecological communities. Using the Yodzis framework of dominance
control versus founder control versus niche control, the importance of
intransitive loops in sub-communities in a source/sink or metacommunity
competition context is examined. It is found that a three-species sub-community
sampled from a species pool composed of nothing but dominance controlled
species pairs can result in a stable three species coexistence. It is shown
that if effect and response competition are balanced, the overall sub-community
will be persistent, anchored by one or more intransitive loops. It is proposed
that such an arrangement be referred to as an intransitive structure. It is
concluded that persistence of a sub-community (when species pairs in the

possible only if it has an intransitive structure.

of many technological and biological systems. Given a mathematical graph
representation of a network, methods from graph theory enable a precise
investigation of its properties. Software for the analysis of graphs is widely
available and has been applied to graphs describing large scale networks such
as social networks, protein-interaction networks, etc. In these applications,
graph acquisition, i.e., the extraction of a mathematical graph from a network,
is relatively simple. However, for many network-like structures, e.g. leaf
venations, slime molds and mud cracks, data collection relies on images where
graph extraction requires domain-specific solutions or even manual. Here we
introduce Network Extraction From Images, NEFI, a software tool that
automatically extracts accurate graphs from images of a wide range of networks
originating in various domains. While there is previous work on graph
extraction from images, theoretical results are fully accessible only to an
expert audience and ready-to-use implementations for non-experts are rarely
available or insufficiently documented. NEFI provides a novel platform allowing
practitioners from many disciplines to easily extract graph representations
from images by supplying flexible tools from image processing, computer vision
and graph theory bundled in a convenient package. Thus, NEFI constitutes a
scalable alternative to tedious and error-prone manual graph extraction and
special purpose tools. We anticipate NEFI to enable the collection of larger
datasets by reducing the time spent on graph extraction. The analysis of these
new datasets may open up the possibility to gain new insights into the
structure and function of various types of networks. NEFI is open source and

ultra high energy cosmic rays. However, great progress in this area has been
made in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of
ground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.
In particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic
rays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding
of the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this
generation are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence
telescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast
with the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of
the events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a
calibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in
coincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that
the reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors
becomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small
part of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,
comes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way
depends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in
composition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy
are considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these
effects. We consider AMIGA, the low energy extension of the Pierre Auger
Observatory corresponding to the surface detectors, to illustrate the use of
the method.

to this complexity, process-based models are often preferred to estimate the
net magnitude and directionality of interactions in the Earth System. However,
these models are based on simplifications of our understanding of nature, thus
are unavoidably imperfect. Conversely, observation-based data of climatic and
environmental variables are becoming increasingly accessible over large scales
due to the progress of space-borne sensing technologies and data-assimilation
techniques. Albeit uncertain, these data enable the possibility to start
unraveling complex multivariable, multiscale relationships if the appropriate
statistical methods are applied.
  Here, we investigate the potential of the wavelet cross-correlation method as
a tool for identifying multiscale interactions, feedback and regime shifts in
geophysical systems. The ability of wavelet cross-correlation to resolve the
fast and slow components of coupled systems is tested on synthetic data of
known directionality, and then applied to observations to study one of the most
critical interactions between land and atmosphere: the coupling between soil
moisture and near-ground air temperature. Results show that our method is not
only able to capture the dynamics of the soil moisture-temperature coupling
over a wide range of temporal scales (from days to several months) and climatic
regimes (from wet to dry), but also to consistently identify the magnitude and
directionality of the coupling. Consequently, wavelet cross-correlations are
presented as a promising tool for the study of multiscale interactions, with
the potential of being extended to the analysis of causal relationships in the
Earth system.

the underlying system dimensionality $D$, have so far been verified in exactly
solvable $1D$ models, belonging to or equivalent to interacting, quadratic
(quasifree), spinless or spinfull, lattice-fermion models. The obtained results
are so appealing that in quest for correlation lengths and associated universal
critical indices $\nu$, which characterize the divergence of correlation
lengths on approaching critical points, one might be inclined to substitute the
hard task of determining an asymptotic behavior of a two-point correlation
function by an easier one, of determining the quantum-critical scaling of the
quantum fidelity. However, the role of system's dimensionality has been left as
an open problem. Our aim in this paper is to fill up this gap, at least
partially, by verifying the laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum
fidelity in a $2D$ case. To this end, we study correlation functions and
quantum fidelity of $2D$ exactly solvable models, which are interacting,
quasifree, spinfull, lattice-fermion models. The considered $2D$ models exhibit
new, as compared with $1D$ ones, features:at a given quantum-critical point
there exists a multitude of correlation lengths and multiple universal critical
indices $\nu$, since these quantities depend on spatial directions, moreover,
the indices $\nu$ may assume larger values. These facts follow from the
obtained by us analytical asymptotic formulae for two-point correlation
functions. In such new circumstances we discuss the behavior of quantum
fidelity from the perspective of quantum-critical scaling theory. In
particular, we are interested in finding out to what extent the quantum
fidelity approach may be an alternative to the correlation-function approach in
studies of quantum-critical points beyond 1D.

  Orientations of Pulsar Radiation and Supernova ""Kicks""","Astrophysical Journal, in press",,"10.1088/0004-637X/804/2/112",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two entwined problems have remained unresolved since pulsars were discovered
nearly 50 years ago: the orientation of their polarized emission relative to
the emitting magnetic field and the direction of putative supernova ``kicks'
relative to their rotation axes. The rotational orientation of most pulsars can
be inferred only from the (``fiducial') polarization angle of their radiation,
when their beam points directly at the Earth and the emitting polar fluxtube
field is $\parallel$ to the rotation axis. Earlier studies have been
unrevealing owing to the admixture of different types of radiation (core and
conal, two polarization modes), producing both $\parallel$ or $\perp$
alignments. In this paper we analyze the some 50 pulsars having three
characteristics: core radiation beams, reliable absolute polarimetry, and
accurate proper motions. The ``fiducial' polarization angle of the core
emission, we then find, is usually oriented $\perp$ to the proper-motion
direction on the sky. As the primary core emission is polarized $\perp$ to the
projected magnetic field in Vela and other pulsars where X-ray imaging reveals
the orientation, this shows that the proper motions usually lie $\parallel$ to
the rotation axes on the sky. Two key physical consequences then follow: first,
to the extent that supernova ``kicks' are responsible for pulsar proper
motions, they are mostly $\parallel$ to the rotation axis; and second that most
pulsar radiation is heavily processed by the magnetospheric plasma such that
the lowest altitude ``parent' core emission is polarized $\perp$ to the
emitting field, propagating as the extraordinary (X) mode.

This material has been found to change from half-metallic ferromagnet to
antiferromagnetic metal (AFM) upon La-overdoping. The original proposition of
such an AFM phase was made for clean samples, but the experimental realization
of La-overdoped SFMO has been found to contain a substantial fraction of
antisite defects. A phase segregation into alternate Fe and Mo rich regions was
observed. In this paper we propose a possible scenario in which this type of
strong antisite concentration can still result in an antiferromagnetic metal
phase, by a novel hopping driven mechanism. Using variational calculations, we
find that proliferation of such phase segregated domain regions can also result
in the stabilization of an A-type AFM over the G-type AFM based on kinetic

this failure is intimately tied up to an assumption which is typically embedded
in modern studies of the gravitational interaction: invariance under the full
group of diffeomorphisms. We base the discussion on the gravitational theory
known as Weyl transverse gravity. While leading to the same classical solutions
as general relativity, and so to the same classical phenomenology, we show that
in the presence of quantum matter (i) the degeneracy between these theories is
broken: general relativity exhibits the well-known cosmological constant
problem while in Weyl transverse gravity the cosmological constant sector is
protected due to gravitational scale invariance, and (ii) this is possible as
the result of abandoning the assumption of full diffeomorphism invariance,
which permits to circumvent classic results on scale-invariance anomalies and
guarantees that gravitational scale invariance survives quantum corrections.
Both results signal new directions in the quest of finding an ultraviolet
completion of gravity.

where we seek an assignment of power levels and a partition of the given set of
links into the minimum number of subsets satisfying the
signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints. Specifically, we are
interested in the efficiency of local power assignment schemes, or oblivious
power schemes, in approximating wireless scheduling. Oblivious power schemes
are motivated by networking scenarios when power levels must be decided in
advance, and not as part of the scheduling computation.
  We first show that the known algorithms fail to obtain sub-logarithmic
bounds; that is, their approximation ratio are $\tilde\Omega(\log
\max(\Delta,n))$, where $n$ is the number of links, $\Delta$ is the ratio of
the maximum and minimum link lengths, and $\tilde\Omega$ hides
doubly-logarithmic factors. We then present the first
$O(\log{\log\Delta})$-approximation algorithm, which is known to be best
possible (in terms of $\Delta$) for oblivious power schemes. We achieve this by
representing interference by a conflict graph, which allows the application of
graph-theoretic results for a variety of related problems, including the
weighted capacity problem. We explore further the contours of approximability,
and find the choice of power assignment matters; that not all metric spaces are
equal; and that the presence of weak links makes the problem harder. Combined,
our result resolve the price of oblivious power for wireless scheduling, or the
value of allowing unfettered power control.

numerically. By using the density-matrix renormalization group method, the
effects of the alternating single-site anisotropy $D$ on fidelity
susceptibility are investigated. Its relation with the quantum phase transition
is analyzed. It is found that the quantum phase transition from the Haldane
spin liquid to periodic N\'{e}el spin solid can be well characterized by the
fidelity. Finite size scaling of fidelity susceptibility shows a power-law
divergence at criticality, which indicates the quantum phase transition is of
second order. The results are confirmed by the second derivative of the
ground-state energy. We also study the relationship between the entanglement
entropy, the Schmidt gap and quantum phase transitions. Conclusions drawn from
these quantum information observables agree well with each other.

strategies to bypass the Nyquist sampling theorem in order to recover more
information than a traditional discrete Fourier transform. Here we examine
three such methods: filter diagonalization, compressed sensing, and
super-resolution. We apply them to a broad range of signal forms commonly found
in science and engineering in order to discover when and how each method can be
used most profitably. We find that filter diagonalization provides the best
results for Lorentzian signals, while compressed sensing and super-resolution
perform better for arbitrary signals.

first discovered amongst by Bessel-Hagen in 1926 and expanded upon by C. L.
Siegel on his 1932 account of Riemanns unpublished work on the zeta function.
By application of standard asymptotic methods for integral estimation, and the
use of certain approximations pertaining to special functions, it proves
possible to derive a new zeta-sum for the Hardy function Z(t). In itself this
new zeta-sum (whose terms made up of elementary functions, but are unlike those
that arise from the analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series) proves to be
a computationally inefficient method for calculation of Z(t). However, by
further, independent analysis, it proves possible to correlate the terms the
new zeta-sum with the terms of the Riemann-Siegel formula, thought, since its
discovery by Siegel, to be the most efficient means of calculating Z(t). Closer
examination of this correlation reveals that is possible to formulate a hybrid
asymptotic formula for Z(t) consisting of a sum containing both Riemann-Siegel
terms and terms from the new zeta-sum, in such a way as to reduce the overall
CPU time required by a factor between 14-15 percent. Alongside the obvious
computational benefits of such a result, the very existence of the new zeta-sum
itself highlights new theoretical avenues of study in this field.

(SNe Ia) that have minima indicating significantly higher (by greater than
about 6000 km/s) velocities than typical ""photospheric-velocity features""
(PVFs). The PVFs are absorption features with minima indicating typical
photospheric (i.e., bulk ejecta) velocities (usually ~9000-15,000 km/s near
B-band maximum brightness). In this work we undertake the most in-depth study
of HVFs ever performed. The dataset used herein consists of 445 low-resolution
optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectra (at epochs up to 5 d past maximum
brightness) of 210 low-redshift SNe Ia that follow the ""Phillips relation."" A
series of Gaussian functions is fit to the data in order to characterise
possible HVFs of Ca II H&K, Si II {\lambda}6355, and the Ca II NIR triplet. The
temporal evolution of the velocities and strengths of the PVFs and HVFs of
these three spectral features is investigated, as are possible correlations
with other SN Ia observables. We find that while HVFs of Ca II are regularly
observed (except in underluminous SNe Ia, where they are never found), HVFs of
Si II {\lambda}6355 are significantly rarer, and they tend to exist at the
earliest epochs and mostly in objects with large photospheric velocities. It is
also shown that stronger HVFs of Si II {\lambda}6355 are found in objects that
lack C II absorption at early times and that have red ultraviolet/optical
colours near maximum brightness. These results lead to a self-consistent
connection between the presence and strength of HVFs of Si II {\lambda}6355 and
many other mutually correlated SN~Ia observables, including photospheric
velocity.
