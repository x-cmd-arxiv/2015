the linear instability of horizontal shear flows, influenced by an aligned
magnetic field and stratification. Various classical instability results, such
as H{\o}iland's growth rate bound and Howard's semi-circle theorem, are
extended to this shallow-water system for quite general profiles. Two specific
piecewise-constant velocity profiles, the vortex sheet and the rectangular jet,
are studied analytically and asymptotically; it is found that the magnetic
field and stratification (as measured by the Froude number) are generally both
stabilising, but weak instabilities can be found at arbitrarily large Froude
number. Numerical solutions are computed for corresponding smooth velocity
profiles, the hyperbolic-tangent shear layer and the Bickley jet, for a uniform
background field. A generalisation of the long-wave asymptotic analysis of
Drazin & Howard (1962) is employed in order to understand the instability
characteristics for both profiles. For the shear layer, the mechanism
underlying the primary instability is interpreted in terms of
counter-propagating Rossby waves, thereby allowing an explication of the
stabilising effects of the magnetic field and stratification.

observables to describe a possible combination of the order effect with
sequential reproducibility for quantum measurements. By the order effect we
mean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the
order of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility:
adjacent reproducibility ($A-A$) and separated reproducibility($A-B-A$). The
first one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of
some observable $A$ measured twice, one $A$ measurement after the other. The
second one, $A-B-A$, is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of $A$
measurement when another quantum observable $B$ is measured between two $A$'s.
Heuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is
complementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, for an important
class of quantum observables given by positive operator valued measures
(POVMs), this may not be the case. The order effect can coexist with a
separated reproducibility as well as adjacent reproducibility for both
observables $A$ and $B.$ However, the additional constraint in the form of
separated reproducibility of the $B-A-B$ type makes this coexistence
impossible. Mathematically, this paper is about the operator algebra for
effects composing POVMs. The problem under consideration was motivated by
attempts to apply the quantum formalism outside of physics, especially, in
cognitive psychology and psychophysics. However, it is also important for
foundations of quantum physics as a part of the problem about the structure of
sequential quantum measurements.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The deluge of date rate in today's networks imposes a cost burden on the
backhaul network design. Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes
an exciting, yet challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul
networks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibers (OF).
While RF is a cost-effective solution as compared to OF, it supports lower data
rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution is the free-space optics
(FSO) as it offers both a high data rate and a relatively low cost. FSO,
however, is sensitive to nature conditions, e.g., rain, fog, line-of-sight.
This paper combines both RF and FSO advantages and proposes a hybrid RF/FSO
backhaul solution. It considers the problem of minimizing the cost of the
backhaul network by choosing either OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links between
the base-stations (BS) so as to satisfy data rate, connectivity, and
reliability constraints. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption
about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a
maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity.
Simulation results show that the proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal
performance, especially for practical prices of the hybrid RF/FSO links.

estimating the signal and noise subspaces from the sample covariance matrix.
For a small number of samples, such methods are exposed to performance
breakdown, as the sample covariance matrix can largely deviate from the true
covariance matrix. In this paper, the problem of DOA estimation performance
breakdown is investigated. We consider the structure of the sample covariance
matrix and the dynamics of the root-MUSIC algorithm. The performance breakdown
in the threshold region is associated with the subspace leakage where some
portion of the true signal subspace resides in the estimated noise subspace. In
this paper, the subspace leakage is theoretically derived. We also propose a
two-step method which improves the performance by modifying the sample
covariance matrix such that the amount of the subspace leakage is reduced.
Furthermore, we introduce a phenomenon named as root-swap which occurs in the
root-MUSIC algorithm in the low sample size region and degrades the performance
of the DOA estimation. A new method is then proposed to alleviate this problem.
Numerical examples and simulation results are given for uncorrelated and
correlated sources to illustrate the improvement achieved by the proposed
methods. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are combined with the pseudo-noise
resampling method to further improve the performance.

As a consequence, for each expanding Thurston map without periodic critical

least one equilibrium state. For such maps, we also establish large deviation
principles for iterated preimages and periodic points. It follows that iterated

aims to localize all the nodes in a static network given the locations of a

propose necessary and sufficient conditions for network localizability with
both algebraic and rigidity theoretic interpretations. The analysis of the
localizability heavily relies on the recently developed bearing rigidity theory
and a special matrix termed the bearing Laplacian. Secondly, we propose a
linear distributed protocol for bearing-based network localization. The
protocol can globally localize a network if and only if the network is
localizable. The sensitivity of the protocol to constant measurement errors is
also analyzed. One novelty of this work is that the localizability analysis and
localization protocol are applicable to networks in arbitrary dimensional

transport their genomic material. For many viral systems, in particular for
human viruses like hepatitis B, adeno or human immunodeficiency virus, that
lead to persistent infections, capsomeres are continuously produced in the
cytoplasm of the host cell while completed capsids exit the cell for a new
round of infection. Here we use coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of
a generic patchy particle model to elucidate the role of the dynamic supply of
capsomeres for the reversible self-assembly of empty T1 icosahedral virus
capsids. We find that for high rates of capsomere influx only a narrow range of
bond strengths exists for which a steady state of continuous capsid production
is possible. For bond strengths smaller and larger than this optimal value, the
reaction volume becomes crowded by small and large intermediates, respectively.
For lower rates of capsomere influx a broader range of bond strengths exists
for which a steady state of continuous capsid production is established,
although now the production rate of capsids is smaller. Thus our simulations
suggest that the importance of an optimal bond strength for viral capsid
assembly typical for in vitro conditions can be reduced by the dynamic influx
of capsomeres in a cellular environment.

self-assembly strategies for their capsids which are sufficiently robust as to
be reconstituted in vitro. Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually
assume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity
over the time course of assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however,
binding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during
the self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). In order to study possible
advantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly,
we use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us
to switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T1 viruses, we
implement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become
active only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly
to be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural
reorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with
small dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping.
However, at the same time it is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during
the final phase. Increasing the number of initial monomers does have only a
weak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly
schemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here
for T3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous
hexamers in the hierarchical scheme. In order to complement the simulations for
this more complicated case, we introduce a master equation approach that agrees
well with the simulation results.

observed under all tested excitation conditions, single photon interference

  (January 2015), 29 pages, 19 figures, two tables",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In our 2013 Astronomical Review article, we discussed the statistics of
variability for 633 faint spectral type A-F stars observed by the Kepler
spacecraft during Quarters 6-13. We found six stars that showed no variability
with amplitude 20 ppm or greater in the range 0.2 to 24.4 cycles/day, but whose
positions in the log g--Teff diagram place them in the delta Sct or gamma Dor
pulsation instability regions established from pre-Kepler ground-based
observations. Here we present results for 2137 additional stars observed during
Quarters 14-17, and find 34 stars that lie within the instability regions. In
Paper I, we included a +229 K offset to the Kepler Input Catalog Teff to take
into account an average systematic difference between the KIC values and the
Teff derived from SDSS color photometry for main-sequence F stars (Pinsonneault
et al. 2012). Here we compare the KIC Teff value and the Teff derived from
spectroscopy taken by the LAMOST instrument (Molenda-Zakowicz et al. 2013,
2014) for 54 stars common to both samples. We find no trend to support applying
the offset, but instead find that a small average temperature decrease relative
to the KIC Teff may be more appropriate for the stars in our spectral-type
range. If the offset is omitted, only 17 of our 34 `constant' stars fall within
the instability regions. For the two `constant' stars also observed by LAMOST,
the LAMOST Teff values are cooler than the KIC Teff by several hundred K, and
would move these stars out of the instability regions. It is possible that a
more accurate determination of their Teff and log g would move some of the
other `constant' stars out of the instability regions. However, if average
(random) errors in Teff are taken into account, 15 to 52 stars may still
persist within the instability regions. Explanations for these `constant'
stars, both theoretical and observational, remain to be investigated.

graph that satisfy the condition that if two vertices are joined by an edge,
the vertex labels are congruent modulo the edge label. Foundational work on
these objects comes from Gilbert, Polster, and Tymoczko, who generalize ideas
from geometry/topology (equivariant cohomology rings) and algebra (algebraic
splines) to develop the notion of generalized splines. Gilbert, Polster, and
Tymoczko prove that the ring of splines on a graph can be decomposed in terms
of splines on its subgraphs (in particular, on trees and cycles), and then
fully analyze splines on trees. Following Handschy-Melnick-Reinders and Rose,
we analyze splines on cycles, in our case integer generalized splines. The
primary goal of this paper is to establish two new bases for the module of
integer generalized splines on cycles: the triangulation basis and the King
basis. Unlike bases in previous work, we are able to characterize each basis
element completely in terms of the edge labels of the underlying cycle. As an
application we explicitly construct the multiplication table for the ring of
integer generalized splines in terms of the King basis.

non-self-gravitating disk surrounding binary supermassive black holes on an
eccentric orbit. The circumbinary disk is significantly misaligned with the
binary orbital plane, and is subject to the time-dependent tidal torques. In
principle, such a disk is warped and precesses, and is torn into mutually
misaligned rings in the region, where the tidal precession torques are stronger
than the local viscous torques. We derive the tidal-warp and tearing radii of
the misaligned circumbinary disks around eccentric SMBH binaries. We find that
in disks with the viscosity parameter, alpha, larger than a critical value
depending on the disk aspect ratio, the disk warping appears outside the
tearing radius. This condition is expressed as alpha > sqrt{H/3r} for H/r
~<0.1, where H is the disk scale height. If alpha < sqrt{H/3r}, only the disk
tearing occurs because the tidal warp radius is inside the tearing radius,
where most of disk material is likely to rapidly accrete onto SMBHs. In warped
and torn disks, both the tidal-warp and the tearing radii most strongly depend
on the binary semi-major axis, although they also mildly depend on the other
orbital and disk parameters. This strong dependence enables us to estimate the
semi-major axis, once the tidal warp or tearing radius is determined
observationally: For the tidal warp radius of 0.1 pc, the semi-major axis is
estimated to be ~10^{-2} pc for 10^7 Msun black hole with typical orbital and
disk parameters. We also briefly discuss the possibility that central objects
of observed warped maser disks in active galactic nuclei are supermassive black

approaches mostly rely on uniform random sampling, which is quite inefficient
for many real world data matrices that exhibit additional structures (e.g.

transforms the decomposition problem to a subspace learning problem is
proposed. The decomposition is carried out using a small data sketch formed
from sampled columns/rows. Even when the data is sampled uniformly at random,
it is shown that the sufficient number of sampled columns/rows is roughly
O(r\mu), where \mu is the coherency parameter and r the rank of the low rank

the problem of column/row sampling from structured data. We provide an analysis

cloud boundaries and for deriving mass surface densities and velocity
dispersions, we settle on a preferred ""CE,$\tau$,G"" method of ""Connected
Extraction"" in position-velocity space plus Gaussian fitting to
opacity-corrected line profiles for velocity dispersion and mass estimation. We
examine how cloud definition affects measurements of the magnitude and
direction of line-of-sight velocity gradients and velocity dispersions,
including associated dependencies on size scale. CE,$\tau$,G-defined GMCs show
velocity dispersion versus size relations $\sigma\propto{s}^{1/2}$, which are
consistent with the large-scale gradients being caused by turbulence. However,
IRDCs have velocity dispersions that are moderately enhanced above those
predicted by this scaling relation. We examine the dynamical state of the
clouds finding mean virial parameters $\bar{\alpha}_{\rm{vir}}\simeq 1.0$ for
GMCs and 1.6 for IRDCs, broadly consistent with models of magnetized virialized
pressure-confined polytropic clouds, but potentially indicating that IRDCs have
more disturbed kinematics. CE,$\tau$,G-defined clouds exhibit a tight
correlation of $\sigma/R^{1/2}\propto\Sigma^n$, with $n\simeq0.7$ for GMCs and
1.3 for IRDCs (c.f., a value of 0.5 expected for a population of virialized
clouds). We conclude that while GMCs show evidence for virialization over a
range of scales, IRDCs may be moderately super virial. Alternatively, IRDCs
could be virialized but have systematically different $^{13}$CO gas phase
abundances, i.e., due to freeze-out, affecting mass estimations.

show that the resulting uniform concentration rate over the given class is
optimal in a minimax sense. Finally, we construct a hierarchical prior that is

does not depend neither on $\theta^\circ$ nor on the given class. Moreover,

information processing, a new paradigm which studies the power and limit of
""quantum advantages"" in various information processing tasks. Problems such as
when quantum advantage exists, and if existing, how much it could be, are at a
central position of these studies. In a broad class of scenarios, there are,
implicitly or explicitly, at least two parties involved, who share a state, and
the correlation in this shared state is the key factor to the efficiency under
concern. In these scenarios, the shared \emph{entanglement} or \emph{discord}
is usually what accounts for quantum advantage. In this paper, we examine a
fundamental problem of this nature from the perspective of game theory, a
branch of applied mathematics studying selfish behaviors of two or more
players. We exhibit a natural zero-sum game, in which the chance for any player
to win the game depends only on the ending correlation. We show that in a
certain classical equilibrium, a situation in which no player can further
increase her payoff by any local classical operation, whoever first uses a
quantum computer has a big advantage over its classical opponent. The
equilibrium is fair to both players and, as a shared correlation, it does not
contain any discord, yet a quantum advantage still exists. This indicates that
at least in game theory, the previous notion of discord as a measure of
non-classical correlation needs to be reexamined, when there are two players
with different objectives.

thermodynamics we describe a system in equilibrium kicked to a state far from
equilibrium and the following dissipative process back to equilibrium. From the
observed value at a certain time after the kick the magnitude of the kick
should be estimated, which is such an ill-posed inverse problem and
fluctuations get relevant. For the model system of a kicked Brownian particle
the time-dependent probability distribution, the information loss about the

method. SnO2 Nanoparticles are produced from different SnO2 solution
concentrations (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mol/L) at room temperature. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis is used to investigate
the effects of changes in Sol concentration on the crystalline and surface
morphology of Nanoparticles. The XRD pattern shows that the particles are in
the standard tetragonal phase of SnO2. The crystallites size are 11.7nm,
18.8nm, and 74.8nm, for 0.1 M, 0.3M and 0.5 M of concentration respectively.
The average size of SnO2 particles decreases by a reduction in the Sol
concentration. The band gap value is 4.07ev, 4.28ev and 4.36ev for 0.1M, 0.3M
and 0.5M of concentration respectively. The UV-visible analysis shows that
decreasing the Sol concentration will cause the absorption edge shift to the
shorter wavelengths, because decreasing the Sol concentration will reduce the
Nanoparticles size, and smaller Nanoparticles size absorb shorter wavelengths
better and also increase the band gap.

numerical simulations confirm that the properties of the observed fields
correspond to those expected from fossil fields. They also showed that rapid
rotation does not modify the surfacic dipolar magnetic configurations, but
hinders the stability of fossil fields. This explains the lack of correlation

It may also explain the lack of detections of magnetic fields in Be stars,
which rotate close to their break-up velocity. In addition, observations by the
BinaMIcS collaboration of hot stars in binary systems show that the fraction of
those hosting detectable magnetic fields is much smaller than for single hot

Schroedinger symmetry. On the holographic side, the source $M$ also appears in
the Lifshitz vacuum with exactly the same properties as for flat NC space-time.

realize a Schroedinger algebra on $M$, allowing for a conserved particle number
current. Finally, we present a probe action for a complex scalar field on the

($|\eta| < 0.8$) for the transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}>0.3$ GeV/$c$. Two
separate pseudorapidity windows of width ($\delta \eta$) ranging from 0.2 to
0.8 are chosen symmetrically around $\eta=0$. The multiplicity correlation
strength ($b_{\rm cor}$) is studied as a function of the pseudorapidity gap
($\eta_{\rm gap}$) between the two windows as well as the width of these
windows. The correlation strength is found to decrease with increasing
$\eta_{\rm gap}$ and shows a non-linear increase with $\delta\eta$. A sizable
increase of the correlation strength with the collision energy, which cannot be
explained exclusively by the increase of the mean multiplicity inside the
windows, is observed. The correlation coefficient is also measured for
multiplicities in different configurations of two azimuthal sectors selected
within the symmetric FB $\eta$-windows. Two different contributions, the
short-range (SR) and the long-range (LR), are observed. The energy dependence
of $b_{\rm cor}$ is found to be weak for the SR component while it is strong

particles belonging to various transverse momentum intervals chosen to have the
same mean multiplicity. Both SR and LR contributions to $b_{\rm cor}$ are found
to increase with $p_{\rm T}$ in this case. Results are compared to PYTHIA and

  A statistical information is given on these sub-populations measuring their

whether the ""daily"" production of babies is purely noisy or is fluctuating
according to some non trivial fractional Brownian motion, - in the four types
of populations, characterized by either their habitat or their religious
attitude, yet living within the same political regime. One of the goals was
also to find whether combined criteria implied a different behavior. Moreover,
we wish to observe whether some seasonal periodicity exists.
  The detrended fluctuation analysis technique is used for finding the fractal
correlation dimension of such (9) signals. It has been first necessary, due to
two periodic tendencies, to define the range regime in which the Hurst exponent
is meaningfully defined. It results that the birth of babies in all cases is a
very strongly persistent signal. It is found that the signal fractal
correlation dimension is weaker (i) for NOx than for Ox, and (ii) or U with
respect to R. Moreover, it is observed that the combination of U or R with NOx
or OX enhances the UNOx, UOx, and ROx fluctuations, but smoothens the RNOx
signal, thereby suggesting a stronger conditioning on religiosity rituals or

of the time correlation functions, controlled by two different localization
lengthscales. For certain combinations of the parameters, this competition
gives rise to an anomalous logarithmic decay of the correlation functions and a
subdiffusive particle motion, which can be understood as a simple crossover
effect between the two relaxation processes. We establish a simple criterion
for this logarithmic decay to be observed. We also find a further
logarithmically slow relaxation related to the relaxation of floppy clusters of
particles in a crowded environment, in agreement with recent findings in other
models for dense chemical gels. Finally, we characterize how the competition of
gel and glass arrest mechanisms affects the dynamical heterogeneities and show
that for certain combination of parameters these heterogeneities can be
unusually large. By measuring the four-point dynamical susceptibility, we probe
the cooperativity of the motion and find that with increasing coupling this
cooperativity shows a maximum before it decreases again, indicating the change

electromagnetic effects in hadronic processes using lattice simulations. The
method can be applied, for example, to the leptonic and semileptonic decays of
light or heavy pseudoscalar mesons. For these quantities the presence of
infrared divergences in intermediate stages of the calculation makes the
procedure much more complicated than is the case for the hadronic spectrum, for
which calculations already exist. In order to compute the physical widths,
diagrams with virtual photons must be combined with those corresponding to the
emission of real photons. Only in this way do the infrared divergences cancel
as first understood by Bloch and Nordsieck in 1937. We present a detailed
analysis of the method for the leptonic decays of a pseudoscalar meson. The
implementation of our method, although challenging, is within reach of the
present lattice technology.

paper addresses this problem by building an expressive compositional action
model. We model one action instance in the video with an ensemble of
spatio-temporal compositions: a number of discrete temporal anchor frames, each
of which is further decomposed to a layout of deformable parts. In this way,
our model can identify a Spatio-Temporal And-Or Graph (STAOG) to represent the
latent structure of actions e.g. triple jumping, swinging and high jumping. The
STAOG model comprises four layers: (i) a batch of leaf-nodes in bottom for
detecting various action parts within video patches; (ii) the or-nodes over
bottom, i.e. switch variables to activate their children leaf-nodes for
structural variability; (iii) the and-nodes within an anchor frame for
verifying spatial composition; and (iv) the root-node at top for aggregating
scores over temporal anchor frames. Moreover, the contextual interactions are
defined between leaf-nodes in both spatial and temporal domains. For model
training, we develop a novel weakly supervised learning algorithm which
iteratively determines the structural configuration (e.g. the production of
leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) along with the optimization of
multi-layer parameters. By fully exploiting spatio-temporal compositions and
interactions, our approach handles well large intra-class action variance (e.g.
different views, individual appearances, spatio-temporal structures). The
experimental results on the challenging databases demonstrate superior
performance of our approach over other competing methods.

start from the task of converting a coherent superposition of energy

both in the deterministic and in the probabilistic scenario. We then design a
recursive protocol, wherein a branching sequence of energy-preserving filters
increases the probability of success while reaching maximum fidelity at each
iteration. Building on the recursive protocol, we construct efficient
approximations of the optimal fidelity-probability trade-off, by taking
coherent superpositions of the different branches generated by probabilistic
filtering. The benefits of this construction are illustrated in applications to
quantum metrology, quantum cloning, coherent state amplification, and
ancilla-driven computation. Finally, we extend our results to transitions where
the input state is generally mixed and we apply our findings to the task of

  Controlled broken PT symmetry","Present replacement clearly justifies the sensitizing non-Hermitian
  study as compared to my earlier submissions. Title slightly modified, however
  entire text has been modified for better understanding of non-Hermitian
  Hamiltonian study. Method of study matrix diagonalization remain invariant",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We find that a broken PT-symmetry operator when interacts with suitable
Hermitian operator, new system becomes completely un-broken PT symmetry.
Further on varying the contribution of Hermiticity one can delay or control the
broken PT-symmetry. Further beyond the critical contribution ,the broken PT
symmetry becomes unbroken in nature. Analytical as well as numerical models
have been presented.
