by changing the gravitational force law or the number of degrees of freedom in
the gravitational sector. Both possibilities can be tested by measurements of
cosmological structure formation. In this paper we elaborate the details of
such tests using the Galileon model as a case study. We pay attention to the
possibility that each new degree of freedom may have stochastically independent
initial conditions, generating different types of potential well in the early
universe and breaking complete correlation between density and velocity power
spectra. This 'stochastic bias' can confuse schemes to parametrize the
predictions of modified gravity models, such as the use of the growth parameter
f alone. Using data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey we show that it will be
possible to obtain constraints using information about the cosmological-scale
force law embedded in the multipole power spectra of redshift-space
distortions. As an example, we obtain an upper limit on the strength of the
conformal coupling to matter in the cubic Galileon model, giving |1/M| < 200 /
Mp. This allows the fifth-force to be stronger than gravity, but is consistent
with zero coupling.

two metrics, g and f. Wormholes can exist if only the null energy condition is
violated, which happens naturally in the bigravity theory since the graviton
energy-momentum tensors do not apriori fulfill any energy conditions. As a
result, the field equations admit solutions describing wormholes whose throat
size is typically of the order of the inverse graviton mass. Hence, they are as
large as the universe, so that in principle we might all live in a giant
wormhole. The wormholes can be of two different types that we call W1 and W2.
The W1 wormholes interpolate between the AdS spaces and have Killing horizons
shielding the throat. The Fierz-Pauli graviton mass for these solutions becomes
imaginary in the AdS zone, hence the gravitons behave as tachyons, but since
the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound is fulfilled, there should be no tachyon
instability. For the W2 wormholes the g-geometry is globally regular and in the
far field zone it becomes the AdS up to subleading terms, its throat can be
traversed by timelike geodesics, while the f-geometry has a completely
different structure and is not geodesically complete. There is no evidence of
tachyons for these solutions, although a detailed stability analysis remains an
open issue. It is possible that the solutions may admit a holographic
interpretation.

central engine. Geometric and physical constraints on the absorber can be
deduced from the reprocessed AGN emission. In particular, the obscuring gas may
reprocess the nuclear X-ray emission producing a narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line and a
Compton reflection hump. In recent years, models of the X-ray reflection from
an obscuring torus have been computed; however, although the reflecting gas may
be dusty, the models do not yet take into account the effects of dust on the
predicted spectrum. We study this problem by analyzing two sets of models, with
and without the presence of dust, using the one dimensional photo-ionization
code Cloudy. The calculations are performed for a range of column densities
($22 <{\rm log}[N_H(\rm cm^{-2})]< 24.5$ ) and hydrogen densities ( $6 <{\rm
log}[n_H(\rm cm^{-3})]< 8$). The calculations show the presence of dust can
enhance the Fe K$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) in the reflected spectrum by
factors up to $\approx$ 8 for Compton thick (CT) gas and a typical ISM grain
size distribution. The enhancement in EW with respect to the reflection
continuum is due to the reduction in the reflected continuum intensity caused
by the anisotropic scattering behaviour of dust grains. This effect will be
most relevant for reflection from distant, predominately neutral gas, and is a
possible explanation for AGNs which show a strong Fe K$\alpha$ EW and a
relatively weak reflection continuum. Our results show it is an important to
take into account dust while modeling the X-ray reflection spectrum, and that
inferring a CT column density from an observed Fe K$\alpha$ EW may not always
be valid. Multi-dimensional models are needed to fully explore the magnitude of
the effect.

is that randomly sampling a tree from such a distribution and then completing
the tree to a tour at minimum cost yields a better approximation guarantee than
simply taking a minimum cost spanning tree (as in Christofides' algorithm). We
argue that an additional step can help: reassembling the spanning trees before

the ratio of surface tension over viscosity. The geometry of the domains is

coupled with technology developed by Cheeger-Gromov and Paternain-Petean are
seen to yield a procedure to compute minimal entropy, minimal volume, Yamabe
invariant and to study collapsing with bounded sectional curvature on
inequivalent smooth structures and inequivalent PL-structures within a fixed
homeomorphism class. We compute these fundamental Riemannian invariants for
every high-dimensional smooth manifold on the homeomorphism class of any smooth
manifold that admits a Riemannian metric of zero sectional curvature. This
includes all exotic and all fake tori of dimension greater than four. We
observe that the minimal volume is not an invariant of the smooth structures,
yet the Yamabe invariant does discern the standard smooth structure from all
the others. We also observe that the fundamental group places no restriction on
the vanishing of the minimal volume and collapse with bounded sectional
curvature for high-dimensional manifolds.

are the assembly of patches (Constructive Solid Geometry geometries made of
Boolean primitives) and local refinement. In the present work we apply the
Additive Schwarz Domain Decomposition on overlapping domains. To leverage the
power of IGA we consider non matching meshes to solve PDEs on CSG assemblies.
As a side effect also we deal with local refinement .
  As a first step we study a collection of simple two domains problems, using
the software package GeoPDEs, all of them converged rapidly, even on very
distorted domains. For local refinement we implement a Chimera type of zooming
together with ASDDM iterations, and here again we get very attractive results.
A last effect is that the additive methods are naturally parallelizable and
thus can extend to large 3D problems. We give some examples of computations on
multi-patch bodies.
  This new implementation of the DD methods brings many interesting problems
such as: the definition of boundary conditions on trimmed patches, choice of
blending operators on the intersections , optimization of the overlap size,
choice of preconditioning to guarantee convergence ( as we do not have a

coefficient is responsible for a large part of such a puzzle. In particular, we
have considered four different models to evaluate the temperature dependence of
drag and diffusion coefficients propagating through a quark gluon plasma (QGP).
All the four different models are set to reproduce the same $R_{AA}(p_T)$
observed in experiments at RHIC and LHC energy. We point out that for the same
$R_{AA}(p_T)$ one can generate 2-3 times more $v_2$ depending on the
temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient. A non-decreasing
drag coefficient as $ T \rightarrow\ T_c \,$ is a major ingredient for a
simultaneous description of $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$.

various spin $s$. We first briefly review the cases of $s=0, \, 1/2, \, 1,\,
3/2$ already discussed in the literature and notice the appearance of the
well-known contact terms for the vector bosons. We then extend this discussion
of the contact terms to massive vector fields, $p$-forms and to the case of
spin $s=2$ particles (gravitons). We observe that, in general, the contact
terms originate from the fields which mediate the interactions (such as vector
gauge bosons and gravitons). We then discuss entanglement entropy and the
conical entropy and their relation to the renormalized Newton constant. We
address the puzzle of the non-analytic terms due to fields of spin $s=2$ and
suggest that the resolution of this puzzle comes from the non-equivalence of
the orbifold and $n$-fold cover constructions which are used in the entropy
calculations. Finally, we propose a mechanism by which the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy is identified with entanglement entropy in any theory which includes
both matter fields and the mediators of interactions (vector gauge bosons and
gravitons).

Eventually, the population's average cooperation and participation levels
converge to and stabilize at a center. (iii) Then, a most peculiar phenomenon
unfolds: The strategies present in the population diversify and give rise to a
""cloud"" of tinkering individuals who each tries out a different strategy, and
this process continues unchecked as long as the population's cooperation and
participation levels remain balanced. Over time, however, imbalances build up
as a consequence of random drift and there is a sudden and abrupt collapse of
the strategy-diversity cloud. The process then repeats again in a cyclic
manner. To understand the three aforementioned phenomena, we investigate the
system analytically using adaptive-dynamics techniques. Our analysis casts
light on the mechanisms which underpin the unexpected and surprising
evolutionary dynamics.

electricity. As with any new technological paradigm, new challenges have
emerged which are unique to the utilization of renewable energy systems. One of
these challenges in particular is the development of effective monitoring
technologies to compensate for the decentralized nature of remote power
generation. This project details the development of an open-source monitoring
system for remote solar power systems. The problem space that this project is
specifically concerned with deals with the reduction of cost and the use of
open platforms to make solar monitoring viable in developing countries where
both the resources and general knowledge required to undertake such efforts are
particularly scarce.
  Currently, solar monitoring technologies are expensive, limited in their
application, and for the most part proprietary. It is arguable that such
systems can be developed using non-customized hardware and open-source software
that can be obtained and run anywhere in the world. This project is one such
argument. This proof of concept is sufficient to show that solar remote
monitoring is neither expensive nor particularly cumbersome to implement and
thus warrants further investigation and development by the open source
community.

There are no glitch-associated changes in the electromagnetic signature of
rotation-powered pulsars in all cases so far. For the first time, in the last
glitch of PSR J1119-6127, there is clear evidence for changing emission
properties coincident with the glitch. This glitch is also unusual in its
signature. Further, the absolute value of the spin-down rate actually decreases
in the long term. This is in contrast to usual glitch behaviour. In this paper
we extend the vortex creep model in order to take into account these
peculiarities. We propose that a starquake with crustal plate movement towards
the rotational poles of the star induces inward vortex motion which causes the
unusual glitch signature. The component of the magnetic field perpendicular to
the rotation axis will decrease, giving rise to a permanent change in the

both strong and weak gravitational lensing in estimates of high-redshift galaxy
luminosity functions. We illustrate our method by estimating the $z\sim8$ UV
luminosity function using a sample of 97 Y-band dropouts (Lyman break galaxies)
found in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey and from the
literature. We find the luminosity function is well described by a Schechter
function with characteristic magnitude of $M^\star = -19.85^{+0.30}_{-0.35}$,
faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.72^{+0.30}_{-0.29}$, and number density of
$\log_{10} \Psi^\star [\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}] = -3.00^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$. These
parameters are consistent within the uncertainties with those inferred from the
same sample without accounting for the magnification bias, demonstrating that
the effect is small for current surveys at $z\sim8$, and cannot account for the
apparent overdensity of bright galaxies compared to a Schechter function found
recently by Bowler et al. (2014a,b) and Finkelstein et al. (2014). We estimate
that the probability of finding a strongly lensed $z\sim8$ source in our sample
is in the range $\sim 3-15 \%$ depending on limiting magnitude. We identify one
strongly-lensed candidate and three cases of intermediate lensing in BoRG
(estimated magnification $\mu>1.4$) in addition to the previously known
candidate group-scale strong lens. Using a range of theoretical luminosity
functions we conclude that magnification bias will dominate wide field surveys
-- such as those planned for the Euclid and WFIRST missions -- especially at
$z>10$. Magnification bias will need to be accounted for in order to derive
accurate estimates of high-redshift luminosity functions in these surveys and
to distinguish between galaxy formation models.

UV-optical range, with the ultimate goal of quantifying the production of these
elements in low- and intermediate-mass stars. Our sample was selected from PNe
with a near-solar metallicity, but spanning a broad range in N/O. This study,
the first of a series, concentrates on the observations and emission-line
measurements obtained by integrating along the entire spatial extent of the
slit. We derived ionic and total elemental abundances for the seven PNe with
the strongest UV line detections (IC~2165, IC~3568, NGC~2440, NGC~3242,
NGC~5315, NGC~5882, and NGC~7662). We compare these new results with other
recent studies of the nebulae, and discuss the relative merits of deriving the
total elemental abundances of C, N, and O using ionization correction factors
(ICFs) versus summed abundances. For the seven PNe with the best UV line
detections, we conclude that summed abundances from direct diagnostics of ions
with measurable UV lines gives the most accurate values for the total elemental
abundances of C and N. In some cases where significant discrepancies exist
between our abundances and those from other studies, we show that the
differences can often be attributed to their use of fluxes that are not
co-spatial. Finally, we examined C/O and N/O versus O/H and He/H in
well-observed Galactic, LMC, and SMC PNe, and found that highly accurate
abundances are essential for properly inferring elemental yields from their
progenitor stars.

we observe how intense UV radiation from O and B stars affects star formation
in molecular clouds. We use the images to locate new candidate outflows and
identify the principal shock waves and irradiated interfaces within dozens of
distinct areas of star-forming activity. Shocked molecular gas in jets traces
the parts of the flow that are most shielded from the intense UV radiation.
Combining the H$_2$ and optical images gives a more complete view of the jets,
which are sometimes only visible in H$_2$. The Carina region hosts several
compact young clusters, and the gas within these clusters is affected by
radiation from both the cluster stars and the massive stars nearby. The Carina
Nebula is ideal for studying the physics of young H II regions and PDR's, as it
contains multiple examples of walls and irradiated pillars at various stages of
development. Some of the pillars have detached from their host molecular clouds
to form proplyds. Fluorescent H$_2$ outlines the interfaces between the ionized

between the Br$\gamma$ and H$_2$ emission along the irradiated interfaces.
These spatial offsets can be used to test current models of PDRs once synthetic
maps of these lines become available.

of bipolar flux concentrations in a two-layer model. We interpret the formation
process in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),
which is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our
simulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is
divided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with
transverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is
induced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all
times. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational
acceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,
and size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.
Bipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of
parameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher
stratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the
turbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux
concentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The
magnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength
until the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the
turbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to
become stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out
to be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,
we find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is
indicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux
concentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging

of our previous one-stage framework in [1]. The two-stage frameworks consists
two different dictionaries. Specifically, the first stage directly finds the
sparse representation of a block with a self-adaptive dictionary consisting of
all possible inter-prediction candidates by solving an L0-norm minimization
problem using an improved orthogonal matching pursuit with embedded
orthonormalization (eOMP) algorithm, and the second stage codes the residual
using DCT dictionary adaptively orthonormalized to the subspace spanned by the
first stage atoms. The transition of the first stage and the second stage is
determined based on both stages' quantization stepsizes and a threshold. We
further propose a complete context adaptive entropy coder to efficiently code
the locations and the coefficients of chosen first stage atoms. Simulation
results show that the proposed coder significantly improves the RD performance
over our previous one-stage coder. More importantly, the two-stage coder, using
a fixed block size and inter-prediction only, outperforms the H.264 coder
(x264) and is competitive with the HEVC reference coder (HM) over a large rate
range.

one-dimensional waveguide in which one end is open and the other is either open
(infinite waveguide) or closed by a mirror (semi-infinite). Upon injection of
two photons (corresponding to weak coherent driving), the resonance
fluorescence and photon correlations are shaped by the effective qubit
transition frequencies and decay rates, which are substantially modified by
interference effects. In contrast to the well-known result in an infinite
waveguide, photons reflected by a single 2LS coupled to a semi-infinite
waveguide are initially bunched, a result that can be simply explained by
stimulated emission. As the number of 2LS increases (up to 10 are considered
here), rapid oscillations build up in the correlations that persist for a very
long time. For instance, when the incoming photons are slightly detuned, the
transmitted photons in the infinite waveguide are highly antibunched. On the
other hand, upon resonant driving, incoherently reflected photons are mostly
distributed within the photonic band gap and several sharp side peaks. These
features can be explained by considering the poles of the single particle Green
function in the Markovian regime combined with the time delay. Our calculation
is not restricted to the Markovian regime, and we obtain several fully
non-Markovian results. We show that a single 2LS in a semi-infinite waveguide
can not be decoupled by placing it at the node of the photonic field, in
contrast to recent results in the Markovian regime. Our results illustrate the
complexities that ensue when several qubits are strongly coupled to a bus (the
waveguide) as might happen in quantum information processing.

profound application impact on many signal processing problems. In the sparse
coding setup, given the observations $\mathrm{y}$ and the redundant dictionary
$\mathbf{\Phi}$, one would seek the most sparse coefficient (signal)
$\mathrm{x}$ with a constraint on approximation fidelity. In this work, we
propose a greedy algorithm based on the classic orthogonal matching pursuit
(OMP) with improved sparsity on $\mathrm{x}$ and better recovery rate, which we
name as eOMP. The key ingredient of the eOMP is recursively performing one-step
orthonormalization on the remaining atoms, and evaluating correlations between
residual and orthonormalized atoms. We show a proof that the proposed eOMP
guarantees to maximize the residual reduction at each iteration. Through
extensive simulations, we show the proposed algorithm has better exact recovery
rate on i.i.d. Gaussian ensembles with Gaussian signals, and more importantly
yields smaller L0-norm under the same approximation fidelity compared to the
original OMP, for both synthetic and practical scenarios. The complexity
analysis and real running time result also show a manageable complexity
increase over the original OMP. We claim that the proposed algorithm has better
practical perspective for finding more sparse representations than existing
greedy algorithms.

line-of-sight velocity dispersion is a steadily increasing function of stellar
age exterior to R=10 kpc, increasing from 30 km/s for the young upper main
sequence stars to 90 km/s for the old red giant branch stars. This monotonic
increase implies that a continuous or recurring process contributed to the
evolution of the disk. Both the slope and normalization of the dispersion vs.
age relation are significantly larger than in the Milky Way, allowing for the
possibility that the disk of M31 has had a more violent history than the disk
of the Milky Way, more in line with cosmological predictions. We also find

However, it has been historically difficult to pin down the dark matter

innermost regions of the Galaxy and in the solar neighbourhood. Here we present
an up-to-date compilation of Milky Way rotation curve measurements, and compare

the existence of dark matter in the inner Galaxy while making no assumptions on

$\lesssim$ 100 Myr) have been identified in significant numbers, their
progenitor gas clouds have eluded detection. Recently, four extreme molecular
clouds residing within 200 pc of the Galactic centre have been identified as
having the properties thought necessary to form YMCs. Here we utilise far-IR
continuum data from the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (HiGAL) and
millimetre spectral line data from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz
Survey (MALT90) to determine their global physical and kinematic structure. We
derive their masses, dust temperatures and radii and use virial analysis to
conclude that they are all likely gravitationally bound -- confirming that they
are likely YMC progenitors. We then compare the density profiles of these
clouds to those of the gas and stellar components of the Sagittarius B2 Main
and North proto-clusters and the stellar distribution of the Arches YMC. We
find that even in these clouds -- the most massive and dense quiescent clouds
in the Galaxy -- the gas is not compact enough to form an Arches-like ($M$ =
2x10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$, R$_{eff}$ = 0.4 pc) stellar distribution. Further
dynamical processes would be required to condense the resultant population,
indicating that the mass becomes more centrally concentrated as the
(proto)-cluster evolves. These results suggest that YMC formation may proceed
hierarchically rather than through monolithic collapse.

formation of globular clusters, as they are often considered analogues. A
currently unanswered question in this field is how long these massive clusters
remain embedded in their natal gas, with important implications for the
formation of multiple populations that have been used to explain phenomena
observed in globular clusters. We present an analysis of ages and masses of the
young massive cluster population of M83. Through visual inspection of the
clusters, and comparison of their SEDs and position in colour-colour space, the
clusters are all exposed (no longer embedded) by < 4 Myr, most likely less,
indicating that current proposed age spreads within older clusters are
unlikely. We also present several methods of constraining the ages of very
young massive clusters. This can often be difficult using SED fitting due to a
lack of information to disentangle age-extinction degeneracies and possible
inaccurate assumptions in the models used for the fitting. The individual
morphology of the Halpha around each cluster has a significant effect on the
measured fluxes, which contributes to inaccuracies in the age estimates for
clusters younger than 10 Myr using SED fitting. This is due to model
uncertainties and aperture effects. Our methods to help constrain ages of young
clusters include using the near-infrared and spectral features, such as
Wolf-Rayet stars.

SMBH binary due to the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, including
octupole effects and apsidal precession caused by the stellar mass distribution
and general relativity. We identify a region around one of the SMBHs in the
binary where the EKL mechanism drives stars to high eccentricities, which
ultimately causes the stars to either scatter off the second SMBH or get
disrupted. For SMBH masses 10^7 Msun and 10^8 Msun, the TDE rate can reach
10^{-2} yr and deplete a region of the stellar cusp around the secondary SMBH
in ~0.5 Myr. As a result, the final geometry of the stellar distribution
between 0.01 and 0.1 pc around the secondary SMBH is a torus. These effects may
be even more prominent in nuclear stellar clusters hosting a supermassive and
an intermediate mass black hole.

area law. However, nonlocal theories at large N and strong coupling violate
this area law. In these theories, the leading divergence in the entanglement
entropy is extensive for regions smaller than the effective nonlocality scale
and proportional to this effective nonlocality scale for regions larger than
it. This raises the question: is a volume law a generic feature of nonlocal
theories, or is it only present at strong coupling and large N?
  This paper investigates entanglement entropy of large regions in weakly
coupled nonlocal theories, to leading order in the coupling. The two theories
studied are phi^4 theory on the noncommutative plane and phi^4 theory with a
dipole type nonlocal modification using a fixed nonlocality scale. Both
theories are found to follow an area law to first order in the coupling, hence
no evidence is found for a volume law. This indicates that, perturbatively the
nonlocal interactions considered are not generating sufficient entanglement at
distances of the nonlocality scale to change the leading divergence, at least
to first order in the coupling. An argument against volume laws at higher
orders is also presented.

Finite Element Method (GMsFEM), where we represent the fracture effects on a
coarse grid via multiscale basis functions. These multiscale basis functions
are constructed in the offline stage via local spectral problems following
GMsFEM. To represent the fractures on the fine grid, we consider two approaches
(1) Discrete Fracture Model (DFM) (2) Embedded Fracture Model (EFM) and their
combination. In DFM, the fractures are resolved via the fine grid, while in EFM
the fracture and the fine grid block interaction is represented as a source
term. In the proposed multiscale method, additional multiscale basis functions
are used to represent the long fractures, while short-size fractures are
collectively represented by a single basis functions. The procedure is
automatically done via local spectral problems. In this regard, our approach
shares common concepts with several approaches proposed in the literature as we
discuss. Numerical results are presented where we demonstrate how one can
adaptively add basis functions in the regions of interest based on error
indicators. We also discuss the use of randomized snapshots
(\cite{randomized2014}) which reduces the offline computational cost.

nano waterwheel and nano engine. A resonance-like phenomenon is found that the
revolving frequency of the charge plays a key role in pumping water chain. The
water flux across the SWNT increases with respect to the revolving frequency of
the external charge and reaches the maximum when the frequency is 4 THz.
Correspondingly, the number of the hydrogen bonds of water chain inside the

The mechanism behind the resonant phenomenon has been investigated

electromagnetic properties are found to be strongly influenced by the substrate
parasitic capacitance and resistance, particularly for high-frequencies f > 1

which matches the frequency response of the graphene 4TP impedance device over
approximately seven decades of the frequency range of the applied transport
alternating current. Based on this model, it is shown for the first time, that
the intrinsic graphene channel resistance of the 4TP device is

strongly lensed z=2.013 galaxy, the arc behind the galaxy cluster MACS
J0451+0006, with ALMA to measure the [CII] 158 micron emission line, one of the
main coolants of the ISM. [CII] emission from the southern part of this galaxy
is detected at 10 $\sigma$. Taking into account strong gravitational lensing,
which provides a magnification of $\mu=49$, the intrinsic lensing-corrected
[CII]158 micron luminosity is $L(CII)=1.2 \times 10^8 L_\odot$. The observed
ratio of [CII]-to-IR emission, $L(CII)/L(FIR) \approx (1.2-2.4) \times
10^{-3}$, is found to be similar to that in nearby galaxies. The same also
holds for the observed ratio $L(CII)/L(CO)=2.3 \times 10^3$, which is
comparable to that of star-forming galaxies and active galaxy nuclei (AGN) at
low redshift. We utilize strong gravitational lensing to extend diagnostic
studies of the cold ISM to an order of magnitude lower luminosity ($L(IR) \sim
(1.1-1.3) \times 10^{11} L_\odot$) and SFR than previous work at high redshift.
While larger samples are needed, our results provide evidence that the cold ISM
of typical high redshift galaxies has physical characteristics similar to
normal star forming galaxies in the local Universe.

that of the quasibound state in the well at equilibrium and follows the
dispersion pattern of the latter. To observe the Fano resonance phenomenon in
the transmission spectrum, we also considered the pumped shot noise properties

is studied. For a grid spacing of less than 350 km, the root mean square
magnetic field strength near the base of the convection zone reaches 95% of the
equipartition field strength (i.e. magnetic and kinetic energy are comparable).
For these solutions the Lorentz force feedback on the convection velocity is
found to be significant. The velocity near the base of the convection zone is
reduced to 50% of the hydrodynamic one. In spite of a significant decrease of
the convection velocity, the reduction in the enthalpy flux is relatively
small, since the magnetic field also suppresses the horizontal mixing of the
entropy between up- and downflow regions. This effect increases the amplitude
of the entropy perturbation and makes convective energy transport more
efficient. We discuss potential implications of these results for solar global

based on fMRI, EEG or MEG to estimate functional connectivity, or relationships
between remote brain regions. In multi-subject studies, scientists seek to
identify the functional brain connections that are different between two groups
of subjects, i.e. connections present in a diseased group but absent in
controls or vice versa. This amounts to conducting two-sample large scale
inference over network edges post graphical model selection, a novel problem we
call Population Post Selection Inference. Current approaches to this problem
include estimating a network for each subject, and then assuming the subject
networks are fixed, conducting two-sample inference for each edge. These
approaches, however, fail to account for the variability associated with
estimating each subject's graph, thus resulting in high numbers of false
positives and low statistical power. By using resampling and random
penalization to estimate the post selection variability together with proper
random effects test statistics, we develop a new procedure we call $R^{3}$ that
solves these problems. Through simulation studies we show that $R^{3}$ offers
major improvements over current approaches in terms of error control and

data-driven Koopman spectral analysis---has gained increased adoption as a
technique for extracting dynamically meaningful spatio-temporal descriptions of
fluid flows from snapshot measurements. Often times, DMD descriptions can be
used for predictive purposes as well, which enables informed decision-making
based on DMD model-forecasts. Despite its widespread use and utility, DMD
regularly fails to yield accurate dynamical descriptions when the measured
snapshot data are imprecise due to, e.g., sensor noise. Here, we express DMD as
a two-stage algorithm in order to isolate a source of systematic error. We show
that DMD's first stage, a subspace projection step, systematically introduces
bias errors by processing snapshots asymmetrically. To remove this systematic
error, we propose utilizing an augmented snapshot matrix in a subspace
projection step, as in problems of total least-squares, in order to account for
the error present in all snapshots. The resulting unbiased and noise-aware
total DMD (TDMD) formulation reduces to standard DMD in the absence of snapshot
errors, while the two-stage perspective generalizes the de-biasing framework to
other related methods as well. TDMD's performance is demonstrated in numerical
and experimental fluids examples.

Rossby number for the plane layer geometry in which the gravity and rotation
vectors are aligned. The small-scale fluctuating dynamics are described by a
magnetically-modified quasi-geostrophic equation set, and the large-scale mean
dynamics are governed by a diagnostic thermal wind balance. The model utilizes
three timescales that respectively characterize the convective timescale, the
large-scale magnetic evolution timescale, and the large-scale thermal evolution
timescale. Distinct equations are derived for the cases of order one and low
magnetic Prandtl number. It is shown that the low magnetic Prandtl number model
is characterized by a magnetic to kinetic energy ratio that is asymptotically
large, with ohmic dissipation dominating viscous dissipation on the
large-scales. For the order one magnetic Prandtl number model the magnetic and
kinetic energies are equipartitioned and both ohmic and viscous dissipation are
weak on the large-scales; large-scale ohmic dissipation occurs in thin magnetic
boundary layers adjacent to the solid boundaries. For both magnetic Prandtl
number cases the Elsasser number is small since the Lorentz force does not
enter the leading order force balance. The new models can be considered fully
nonlinear, generalized versions of the dynamo model originally developed by
Childress and Soward [Phys. Rev. Lett., \textbf{29}, p.837, 1972]. These models
may be useful for understanding the dynamics of convection-driven dynamos in
regimes that are only just becoming accessible to direct numerical simulations.

one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gas in harmonic traps, by
solving self-consistently the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The dark soliton
- to be created by phase-imprinting in future experiments - is characterized by
a real order parameter, which changes sign at a point node and hosts localized
Andreev bound states near the node. By considering both cases of a single
soliton and of multiple solitons, we find that the energy of these bound states
decreases to zero, when the system is tuned to enter the topological superfluid
phase by increasing an external Zeeman field. As a result, two Majorana
fermions emerge in the vicinity of each soliton, in addition to the well-known
Majorana fermions at the trap edges associated with the nontrivial topology of
the superfluid. We propose that the soliton-induced Majorana fermions can be
directly observed by using spatially-resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy or
indirectly probed by measuring the density profile at the point node. For the
latter, the deep minimum in the density profile will disappear due to the
occupation of the soliton-induced zero-energy Majorana fermion modes. Our
prediction could be tested in a resonantly-interacting spin-orbit coupled
$^{40}$K Fermi gas confined in a two-dimensional optical lattice.

In agreement with photoemission experiments at ambient pressure, we find for

about 5 and 0.4 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively. For elevated

towards higher energies, however, the position of the Mn-induced states
relative to the Fermi energy remains constant due to hybridization of the
Mn-3$d$ levels with the valence As-4$p$ orbitals. We also evaluate, employing
Monte Carlo simulations, the Curie temperature ($T_{{\rm C}}$). At zero
pressure, we obtain $T_{{\rm C}}=181$K, whereas the pressure-induced changes in
$T_{{\rm C}}$ are d$T_{{\rm C}}$/d$p=+4.3$K/GPa for $x=12.5\%$ and an estimated

a way to generate magnon dc currents and show how to enhance their amplitudes

FI, we first revisit microwave pumping at finite (room) temperature from the
microscopic viewpoint of magnon injection. Next, we apply it to two kinds of
hybrid ferromagnetic insulating junctions. The first is the junction between a
quasi-equilibrium magnon condensate and magnons being pumped by microwave,
while the second is the junction between such pumped magnons and noncondensed
magnons. We show that quasi-equilibrium magnon condensates generate ac and dc
magnon currents, while noncondensed magnons produce essentially a dc magnon
current. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) drastically increases the density of
the pumped magnons and enhances such magnon currents. Lastly, using microwave
pumping in a single FI, we discuss the possibility that a magnon current
through an Aharonov-Casher phase flows persistently even at finite temperature.
We show that such a magnon current arises even at finite temperature in the
presence of magnon-magnon interactions. Due to FMR, its amplitude becomes much
larger than the condensed magnon current.

aspects of liquid matter under extreme conditions. They have been extensively
studied at pressures and temperatures relevant to various industrial
applications. However, much less is known about the structural behaviour of
supercritical fluids and no structural crossovers have been observed in static
compression experiments in any temperature and pressure ranges beyond the
critical point. The structure of supercritical state is currently perceived to
be uniform everywhere on the pressure-temperature phase diagram, and to change
only in a monotonic way even moving around the critical point, not only along
isotherms or isobars. Conversely, we observe structural crossovers for the
first time in a deeply supercritical sample through diffraction measurements in
a diamond anvil cell and discover a new thermodynamic boundary on the
pressure-temperature diagram. We explain the existence of these crossovers in
the framework of the phonon theory of liquids using molecular dynamics
simulations. The obtained results are of prime importance since it implies a
global reconsideration of the mere essence of the supercritical phase.
Furthermore, this discovery may pave the way to new unexpected applications and
to the exploration of exotic behaviour of confined fluids relevant to geo- and
planetary sciences.

term generates a healthy (ghost-free) fourth-order derivative term, while the
fourth-order term provides an unhealthy (ghost) fourth-order derivative term.
The Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum obtained from Fourier transforming the
fourth-order propagator in de Sitter space is recovered by computing the power

calculations that take into account the entire history of progenitor stars,

show that for progenitor metallicities in the range 0.00003--0.001, and in the
absence of carbon enrichment due to the occurrence of a third dredge-up
episode, the resulting H envelope of the low-mass white dwarfs is thick enough
to make stable H burning the most important energy source even at low
luminosities. This has a significant impact on white dwarf cooling times. This
result is independent of the adopted mass-loss rate during the
thermally-pulsing and post-AGB phases, and the planetary nebulae stage. We
conclude that in the absence of third dredge-up episodes, a significant part of
the evolution of low-mass white dwarfs resulting from low-metallicity
progenitors is dominated by stable H burning. Our study opens the possibility
of using the observed white dwarf luminosity function of low-metallicity
globular clusters to constrain the efficiency of third dredge up episodes

gravitational lensing induced by foreground deflectors not only in galaxy
clusters, but also in blank fields. We quantify the impact of strong
magnification in the samples of $B$, $V$, $i$, $z$ $\&$ $Y$ LBGs ($4\lesssim z
\lesssim8$) observed in the XDF and GOODS/CANDELS fields, by investigating the
proximity of dropouts to foreground objects. We find that $\sim6\%$ of bright
LBGs ($m_{H_{160}}<26$) at $z\sim7$ have been strongly lensed ($\mu>2$) by
foreground objects. This fraction decreases from $\sim 3.5\%$ at $z\sim6$ to
$\sim1.5\%$ at $z\sim4$. Since the observed fraction of strongly lensed
galaxies is a function of the shape of the luminosity function (LF), it can be
used to derive Schechter parameters, $\alpha$ and $M_{\star}$, independently
from galaxy number counts. Our magnification bias analysis yields
Schechter-function parameters in close agreement with those determined from
galaxy counts albeit with larger uncertainties. Extrapolation of our analysis
to $z\gtrsim 8$ suggests that future surveys with JSWT, WFIRST and EUCLID
should find excess LBGs at the bright-end, even if there is an intrinsic
exponential cutoff of number counts. Finally, we highlight how the
magnification bias measurement near the detection limit can be used as probe of
the population of galaxies too faint to be detected. Preliminary results using
this novel idea suggest that the magnification bias at $M_{UV}\sim -18$ is not
as strong as expected if $\alpha\lesssim -1.7$ extends well below the current
detection limits in the XDF. At face value this implies a flattening of the LF
at $M_{UV}\gtrsim-16.5$. However, selection effects and completeness estimates
are difficult to quantify precisely. Thus, we do not rule out a steep LF
extending to $M_{UV}\gtrsim -15$.

effects on air dose rates, this study presents calculations for ambient dose
equivalent rates at a range of heights above the ground for varying land
topographies. The geometries considered were angled ground at the intersection
of two planar surfaces, which is a model for slopes neighboring flat land, and
a simple conical geometry, representing settings from hilltops to valley

the slope angle was varied systematically to determine the effect of topography
on the air dose rate. Under the assumption of homogeneous fallout across the
land surface, and for these geometries and detector locations, the dose rates
at high altitudes are more strongly affected by the underlying land topography
than those close to ground level. At a height of 300m, uneven topographies can
lead to a 50% change in air dose rates compared to if the ground were uniformly
flat. However, in practice the effect will more often than not be smaller than
this, and heterogeneity in the source distribution is likely to be a more
significant factor in determining local air dose rates.

observational data of the event horizon telescope (EHT) at 230~GHz obtained by
Doeleman et al. By utilizing the method in Kino et al., we derive the energy
densities of magnetic fields ($U_{B}$) and electrons and positrons ($U_{\pm}$)
in the compact region detected by EHT (EHT-region) with its
full-width-half-maximum size $40~{\rm \mu as}$. First, we assume that an
optically-thick region for synchrotron self absorption (SSA) exists in the
EHT-region. Then, we find that the SSA-thick region should not be too large not
to overproduce the Poynting power at the EHT-region. The allowed ranges of the
angular size and the magnetic field strength of the SSA-thick region are
$21~{\rm \mu as} \le \theta_{\rm thick}\le 26.3~{\rm \mu as}$ and $50~{\rm
G}\le B_{\rm tot}\le 124~{\rm G}$, respectively. Correspondingly $U_{B}\gg
U_{\pm} $ is realized in this case. We further examine the composition of
plasma and energy density of protons by utilizing the Faraday rotation
measurement ($RM$) at 230~GHz obtained by Kuo et al. Then, we find that
$U_{B}\gg U_{\pm}+U_{p} $ still holds in the SSA-thick region. Second, we
examine the case when EHT-region is fully SSA-thin. Then we find that $U_{B}\gg
U_{\pm}$ still holds unless protons are relativistic. Thus, we conclude that
magnetically driven jet scenario in M87 is viable in terms of energetics close
to ISCO scale unless the EHT-region is fully SSA-thin and relativistic protons
dominated.

subordinators. A class of models due to Grigelionis (2007), which contains the
well-known Madan-Seneta V.G. model, is of this type, but our multivariate
generalization is considerably wider, allowing in particular for processes with
infinite variation and a variety of dependencies between the underlying
processes. Multivariate classes developed by P\'erez-Abreu and Stelzer (2012)
and Semeraro (2008) and Guillaume (2013) are also submodels. The new models are
shown to be invariant under Esscher transforms, and quite explicit expressions
for canonical measures (and transition densities in some cases) are obtained,
which permit applications such as option pricing using PIDEs or tree based
methodologies. We illustrate with best-of and worst-of European and American
options on two assets.

control the number of devices eligible to participate in Demand Response

algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan
parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we
recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable
thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with
similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple
power throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature
deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical

(log N(HI)>=21.7) observed towards quasars with VLT/UVES. We measure overall
metallicities of [Zn/H]~-1.2, -1.3 and -0.7 at respectively zabs=2.34 towards
SDSS J2140-0321 (log N(HI) = 22.4+/-0.1), zabs=3.35 towards SDSS J1456+1609
(log N(HI) = 21.7+/-0.1) and zabs=2.25 towards SDSS J0154+1935 (log N(HI) =
21.75+/-0.15). We detect H2 towards J2140-0321 (log N(H2) = 20.13+/-0.07) and
J1456+1609 (log N(H2) = 17.10+/-0.09) and argue for a tentative detection
towards J0154+1935. Absorption from the excited fine-structure levels of OI, CI
and SiII are detected in the system towards J2140-0321, that has the largest HI
column density detected so far in an intervening DLA. This is the first
detection of OI fine-structure lines in a QSO-DLA, that also provides us a rare
possibility to study the chemical abundances of less abundant atoms like Co and
Ge. Simple single phase photo-ionisation models fail to reproduce all the
observed quantities. Instead, we suggest that the cloud has a stratified
structure: H2 and CI likely originate from both a dense (log nH~2.5-3) cold
(80K) and warm (250K) phase containing a fraction of the total HI while a
warmer (T>1000 K) phase probably contributes significantly to the high
excitation of OI fine-structure levels. The observed CI/H2 column density ratio
is surprisingly low compared to model predictions and we do not detect CO
molecules: this suggests a possible underabundance of C by 0.7 dex compared to
other alpha elements. The absorber could be a photo-dissociation region close
to a bright star (or a star cluster) where higher temperature occurs in the
illuminated region. Direct detection of on-going star formation through e.g.
NIR emission lines in the surrounding of the gas would enable a detailed
physical modelling of the system.

the convergence of numerical methods for partial differential equations. The
key idea of local Fourier analysis is to represent the occurring functions in
terms of a Fourier series and to use this representation to study certain
properties of the particular numerical method, like the convergence rate or an
error estimate.
  In the process of applying a local Fourier analysis, it is typically
necessary to determine the supremum of a more or less complicated term with
respect to all frequencies and, potentially, other variables. The problem of
computing such a supremum can be rewritten as a quantifier elimination problem,
which can be solved with cylindrical algebraic decomposition, a well-known tool
from symbolic computation.
  The combination of local Fourier analysis and cylindrical algebraic
decomposition is a machinery that can be applied to a wide class of problems.
In the present paper, we will discuss two examples. The first example is to
compute the convergence rate of a multigrid method. As second example we will
see that the machinery can also be used to do something rather different: We
will compare approximation error estimates for different kinds of
discretizations.

It turns out that the often used hydrogen etching of the substrate is
responsible for undesirable high macro steps evolving during graphene growth. A
more advantageous type of sub-nanometer stepped graphene layers is obtained
with a new method: a high-temperature conditioning of the SiC surface in argon
atmosphere. The results can be explained by the observed graphene buffer layer
domains after the conditioning process which suppress giant step bunching and
graphene step flow growth. The superior electronic quality is demonstrated by a
less extrinsic resistance anisotropy obtained in nano-probe transport
experiments and by the excellent quantization of the Hall resistance in
low-temperature magneto-transport measurements. The quantum Hall resistance
agrees with the nominal value (half of the von Klitzing constant) within a

demonstrate that the catastrophic disruption of bodies larger than a few

gravitational reaccumulation of smaller fragments, which helps explain the
presence of large members within asteroid families. Thus, for the first time,
numerical simulations successfully reproduced the sizes and ejection velocities

place (with no legions) of the Roman Empire must be protected by a ""stronger""
neighbor place (having two legions), a graph theoretical model called Roman
domination in graphs was described. A Roman dominating function for a graph
$G=(V,E)$, is a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that every vertex $v$
with $f(v)=0$ has at least a neighbor $w$ in $G$ for which $f(w)=2$. The Roman
domination number of a graph is the minimum weight, $\sum_{v\in V}f(v)$, of a
Roman dominating function.
  In this paper we initiate the study of a new parameter related to Roman
domination, which we call strong Roman domination number and denote it by
$\gamma_{StR}(G)$. We approach the problem of a Roman domination-type defensive
strategy under multiple simultaneous attacks and begin with the study of
several mathematical properties of this invariant. In particular, we first show
that the decision problem regarding the computation of the strong Roman
domination number is NP-complete, even when restricted to bipartite graphs. We
obtain several bounds on such a parameter and give some realizability results
for it. Moreover, we prove that for any tree $T$ of order $n\ge 3$,
$\gamma_{StR}(T)\le 6n/7$ and characterize all extremal trees.

hundreds of halo field stars observed in the first eighteen months of the

distributions of those input variables. On the other hand, Kriging assumes that
the computer model behaves as a realization of a Gaussian random process whose
parameters are estimated from the available computer runs, i.e. input vectors
and response values. These two techniques have been developed more or less in
parallel so far with little interaction between the researchers in the two
fields. In this paper, PC-Kriging is derived as a new non-intrusive
meta-modeling approach combining PCE and Kriging. A sparse set of orthonormal
polynomials (PCE) approximates the global behavior of the computational model
whereas Kriging manages the local variability of the model output. An adaptive
algorithm similar to the least angle regression algorithm determines the
optimal sparse set of polynomials. PC-Kriging is validated on various benchmark
analytical functions which are easy to sample for reference results. From the
numerical investigations it is concluded that PC-Kriging performs better than
or at least as good as the two distinct meta-modeling techniques. A larger gain
in accuracy is obtained when the experimental design has a limited size, which
is an asset when dealing with demanding computational models.

was dry etched before being regrown with semi-insulating Fe:InP. This
fabrication strategy results in a refractive index contrast of 10% allowing
good photonic mode control, and simultaneously provides good thermal extraction
during operation. Single mode emission with narrow far field pattern and peak
powers up to 0.88 W at 263 K were recorded from the facet of the photonic
crystal laser, and lasing operation was maintained up to room temperature. The
lasing modes emitted from square photonic crystal mesas with a side length of
550{\mu}m, were identified as slow Bloch photonic crystal modes by means of
three-dimensional photonic simulations and measurements.

onto a neutron star in an X-ray binary. Despite having been known for almost 40
years, no model can yet satisfactorily account for all their properties. To
shed light on the nature of this phenomenon and provide a reference for future
theoretical work, we study the entire sample of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
data of type II bursts from the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-335). We find that type
II bursts are Eddington-limited in flux, that a larger amount of energy goes in
the bursts than in the persistent emission, that type II bursts can be as short
as 0.130 s, and that the distribution of recurrence times drops abruptly below
15-18 s. We highlight the complicated feedback between type II bursts and the
NS surface thermonuclear explosions known as type I bursts, and between type II
bursts and the persistent emission. We review a number of models for type II
bursts. While no model can reproduce all the observed burst properties and
explain the source uniqueness, models involving a gating role for the magnetic
field come closest to matching the properties of our sample. The uniqueness of
the source may be explained by a special combination of magnetic field
strength, stellar spin period and alignment between the magnetic field and the
spin axis.

atmosphere. The propagation and damping of these waves may play relevant roles
for the transport and dissipation of energy in the solar atmospheric medium.
However, in the atmospheric plasma dissipation of transverse MHD wave energy by
viscosity or resistivity needs very small spatial scales to be efficient. Here,
we theoretically investigate the generation of small scales in nonuniform solar
magnetic flux tubes due to phase mixing of MHD kink waves. We go beyond the
usual approach based on the existence of a global quasi-mode that is damped in
time due to resonant absorption. Instead, we use a modal expansion to express
the MHD kink wave as a superposition of Alfv\'en continuum modes that are phase
mixed as time evolves. The comparison of the two techniques evidences that the
modal analysis is more physically transparent and describes both the damping of
global kink motions and the building up of small scales due to phase mixing. In
addition, we discuss that the processes of resonant absorption and phase mixing
are intimately linked. They represent two aspects of the same underlying
physical mechanism: the energy cascade from large scales to small scales due to
naturally occurring plasma and/or magnetic field inhomogeneities. This process
may provide the necessary scenario for efficient dissipation of transverse MHD
wave energy in the solar atmospheric plasma.

events from an increase in the efficiency of Fermi II acceleration will produce
a positive correlation between all bandpasses and a marked plateau in the HE
gamma-ray lightcurve. We also predict a distinctive dip in the HE lightcurve

appearing to be deflected away from overdensities in the surrounding medium.
Furthermore, the GRG lobes tend to be normal to the plane defined by the galaxy

Slow-rotating 2-spheres are added along the ``Schwarzschild line''. For (1), we

transformation of the Schwarzschild metric. For (2), we solve the general
linearised vacuum equations under several special cases. In particular, there
exist linearised vacuum solutions with signature-changing metrics that contain
closed timelike curves (though these do not correspond to adding topological
2-spheres). For (3), we find that the first order vacuum solution is equivalent
to the slowly rotating Kerr metric. This is hence a much simpler and
geometrically insightful derivation as compared to the gravitomagnetic one,
where this rotating-shells construction is a direct manifestation of the
frame-dragging phenomenon. We also show that the full Kerr however, cannot be

abundance is overestimated by about a factor of 2--3 comparing to the
astronomical observations, so called the pending cosmological lithium problem.
The $^7$Be($n$,$\alpha$)$^4$He reaction, which may affect the $^7$Li abundance,
was regarded as the secondary important reaction in destructing the $^7$Be
nucleus in BBN. However, the thermonuclear rate of $^7$Be($n$,$\alpha$)$^4$He
has not been well studied so far. This reaction rate was firstly estimated by
Wagoner in 1969, which has been generally adopted in the current BBN
simulations and the reaction rate library. This simple estimation involved only
a direct-capture reaction mechanism, but the resonant contribution should be
also considered according to the later experimental results. In this work, we
have revised this rate based on the indirect cross-section data available for
the $^4$He($\alpha$,$n$)$^7$Be and $^4$He($\alpha$,$p$)$^7$Li reactions, with
the charge symmetry and detailed-balance principle. Our new result shows that
the previous rate (acting as an upper limit) is overestimated by about a factor
of ten. The BBN simulation shows that the present rate leads to a 1.2\%
increase in the final $^7$Li abundance compared to the result using the Wagoner
rate, and hence the present rate even worsens the $^7$Li problem. By the
present estimation, the role of $^7$Be($n$,$\alpha$)$^4$He in destroying $^7$Be
is weakened from the secondary importance to the third, and the
$^7$Be($d$,$p$)2$^4$He reaction becomes of secondary importance in destructing
$^7$Be.

consisting of a graph G and integer k, whether k vertices can be removed from G

paper analyzes to what extent provably effective and efficient preprocessing is
possible for F-Minor-Free Deletion. Fomin et al. (FOCS 2012) showed that the
special case Planar F-Deletion (when F contains at least one planar graph) has
a kernel of size f(F) * k^{g(F)} for some functions f and g. The degree g of
the polynomial grows very quickly; it is not even known to be computable. Fomin
et al. left open whether Planar F-Deletion has kernels whose size is uniformly
polynomial, i.e., of the form f(F) * k^c for some universal constant c that
does not depend on F. Our results in this paper are twofold. (1) We prove that
some Planar F-Deletion problems do not have uniformly polynomial kernels
(unless NP is in coNP/poly). In particular, we prove that Treewidth-Eta
Deletion does not have a kernel with O(k^{eta/4} - eps) vertices for any eps >
0, unless NP is in coNP/poly. In fact, we even prove the kernelization lower
bound for the larger parameter vertex cover number. This resolves an open
problem of Cygan et al. (IPEC 2011). It is a natural question whether further
restrictions on F lead to uniformly polynomial kernels. However, we prove that
even when F contains a path, the degree of the polynomial must, in general,
depend on the set F. (2) A canonical F-Minor-Free Deletion problem when F
contains a path is Treedepth-eta Deletion: can k vertices be removed to obtain
a graph of treedepth at most eta? We prove that Treedepth-eta Deletion admits
uniformly polynomial kernels with O(k^6) vertices for every fixed eta. In order
to develop the kernelization we prove several new results about the structure

  Polynomial Ideals",,,,,"cs.SC math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When studying local properties of a polynomial ideal, one usually needs a
theoretic technique called localization. For most cases, in spite of its
importance, the computation in a localized ring cannot be algorithmically
preformed. On the other hand, the standard basis method is very effective for
the computation in a special kind of localized rings, but for a general
semigroup order the geometry of the localization of a positive-dimensional
ideal is difficult to interpret.
  In this paper, we introduce a new ideal operation called extraction. For an
ideal $I$ in a polynomial ring $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ over a field $K$, we use
another ideal $J$ to control the primary components of $I$ and the result
$\beta(I,J)$ is called the extraction of $I$ by $J$. It is still a polynomial
ideal and has a concrete geometric meaning in $\bar{K}^n$, i.e., we keep the
branches of $\textbf{V}(I) \subset \bar{K}^n$ that intersect with
$\textbf{V}(J) \subset \bar{K}^n$ and delete others, where $\bar{K}$ is the
algebraic closure of $K$. This is what we mean by visible. On the other hand,
we can use the standard basis method to compute a localized ideal corresponding
to $\beta(I,J)$ without a complete primary decomposition, and can do further
computation in the localized ring such as determining the membership problem of
$\beta(I,J)$. Moreover, we prove that extractions are as powerful as
localizations in the sense that for any multiplicatively closed subset $S$ of
$K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and any polynomial ideal $I$, there always exists a
polynomial ideal $J$ such that $\beta(I,J)=(S^{-1}I)^c$.

contribution of including different observables, physical effects (galaxy bias,
WL, RSD, BAO) and approximations (non-linearities, Limber approximation,
covariance between probes). The radial information is included by using the
cross-correlation of separate narrow redshift bins. For the auto correlation
the separation of galaxy pairs is mostly transverse, while the
cross-correlations also includes a radial component. We study how this
information adds to our figure of merit (FoM), which includes the dark energy
equation of state $w(z)$ and the growth history, parameterized by $\gamma$. We
show that the Limber approximation and galaxy bias are the most critical
ingredients to the modelling of correlations. Adding WL increases our FoM by
4.8, RSD by 2.1 and BAO by 1.3. We also explore how overlapping surveys perform
under the different assumption and for different figures of merit. Our
qualitative conclusions depend on the survey choices and scales included, but

using the form factor approach and the bootstrap program, the lattice
description and the lattice TBA equations for a full understanding of the
model.
  The bootstrap program aims to explicitly solve 1+1 dimensional integrable
quantum field theories. In the first step, called the S-matrix bootstrap, the
scattering matrix, is determined from its properties. In developing a defect
form factor program the first step is the T-matrix bootstrap. Interacting
integrable defect theories are purely transmitting and topological. We analyze
both operators localized in the bulk and also on the defect. By finding their
solutions, the spectral representation of any correlator can be determined.
  Next we consider the model on the lattice. The lattice approach allows to
obtain both massive and massless excited TBA equations by studying the
continuum scaling limit of the associated integrable lattice models. The most
important input from the lattice approach is an insight into the analytic
structure of the excited state solutions of the TBA equations. Previously this
structure had to be guessed. In this thesis we turn our attention to the
simplest example of a non-unitary minimal theory, namely, the Lee-Yang minimal
model M(2,5). We study the Lee-Yang model on the lattice. We analyze the
periodic, boundary and the seam cases in both massive and massless regimes. We
derive their ground state TBA equations and analyze the flows between different
boundary and defect conditions.
  Finally, in the large volume limit, we calculate the L\""uscher correction
terms of the TBA energy of a one-particle state. We display those ideas in the
end of the thesis as this is an important direction of work in string theory,
particularly in the AdS/CFT correspondence.

an arbitrary compactly generated locally compact Hausdorff topological group
$G$, we consider the canonical action of $G$ on the closed unit ball of
$L^{1}(G)' \cong L^{\infty}(G)$ endowed with the corresponding weak-$^{\ast}$

copolymer, PA66/6I, with various film thicknesses using dielectric relaxation
spectroscopy. Two dielectric signals are observed at high temperatures, the
$\alpha$-process and the relaxation process due to electrode polarization (the
EP-process). The relaxation time of the EP-process has a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann
type of temperature dependence, and the glass transition temperature, $T_{\rm
g}$, evaluated from the EP-process agrees very well with the $T_{\rm g}$
determined from the thermal measurements. The fragility index derived from the
EP-process increases with decreasing film thickness. The relaxation time and
the dielectric relaxation strength of the EP-process are described by a linear
function of the film thickness $d$ for large values of $d$, which can be
regarded as experimental evidence for the validity of attributing the observed
signal to the EP-process. Furthermore, there is distinct deviation from this
linear law for thicknesses smaller than a critical value. This deviation
observed in thinner films is associated with an increase in the mobility and/or
diffusion constant of the charge carriers responsible for the EP-process. The
$\alpha$-process is located in a high frequency region than the EP-process at
high temperatures, but merges with the EP-process at lower temperatures near
the glass transition region. The thickness dependence of the relaxation time of
the $\alpha$-process is different from that of the EP-process. This suggests
that there is decoupling between the segmental motion of the polymers and the
translational motion of the charge carriers in confinement.

al. in [ESA 2013]. Among other results, Chechik et al. have shown that Secluded
Path is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on unweighted graphs being

from this correlation because it was not easily detected in the interstellar

species in comet Hale-Bopp. Ethylene glycol thus appears, together with the
related molecules glycolaldehyde CH$_{2}$OHCHO and ethanol CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$OH,
as a key species in the comparison of interstellar and cometary ices as well as
in any discussion on the formation of cometary matter. We focus here on the
analysis of ethylene glycol in the nearest and best studied hot core-like
region, Orion-KL. We use ALMA interferometric data because high spatial
resolution observations allow us to reduce the line confusion problem with
respect to single-dish observations since different molecules are expected to
exhibit different spatial distributions. Furthermore, a large spectral
bandwidth is needed because many individual transitions are required to
securely detect large organic molecules. Confusion and continuum subtraction
are major issues and have been handled with care. We have detected the aGg'
conformer of ethylene glycol in Orion-KL. The emission is compact and peaks
towards the Hot Core close to the main continuum peak, about 2"" to the

species. Assuming optically thin lines and local thermodynamic equilibrium, we
derive a rotational temperature of 145 K and a column density of 4.6 10$^{15}$

the power spectrum of galaxies measured in a spectroscopic redshift survey. For
the latter we assume a wide survey at relatively large redshifts, similar to
the planned Euclid survey, as baseline for future experiments. To assess the
impact of the bias we perform a Fisher matrix analysis and we adopt two
different parametrizations of scale-dependent bias. The fiducial models for
galaxy bias are calibrated using a mock catalogs of H$\alpha$ emitting galaxies
mimicking the expected properties of the objects that will be targeted by the
Euclid survey.
  In our analysis we have obtained two main results. First of all, allowing for
a scale-dependent bias does not significantly increase the errors on the other
cosmological parameters apart from the rms amplitude of density fluctuations,
$\sigma_{8}$, and the growth index $\gamma$, whose uncertainties increase by a
factor up to two, depending on the bias model adopted. Second, we find that the
accuracy in the linear bias parameter $b_{0}$ can be estimated to within 1-2\%
at various redshifts regardless of the fiducial model. The non-linear bias
parameters have significantly large errors that depend on the model adopted.
Despite of this, in the more realistic scenarios departures from the simple
linear bias prescription can be detected with a $\sim2\,\sigma$ significance at
each redshift explored.
  Finally, we use the Fisher Matrix formalism to assess the impact of assuming
an incorrect bias model and found that the systematic errors induced on the
cosmological parameters are similar or even larger than the statistical ones.

facilitating its implementation. Furthermore, due to the orthogonality, the

modelling efforts by numerically simulating the shear-flow driven gas and dust
dynamics in locations where the H$_{II}$ region and the molecular cloud
interact. We aim to directly confront the simulation results with the infrared
observations. Methods: To numerically model the onset and full nonlinear
development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability we take the setup proposed to
interpret the observations, and adjust it to a full 3D hydrodynamical
simulation that includes the dynamics of gas as well as dust. A dust grain
distribution with sizes between 5-250 nm is used, exploiting the gas+dust
module of the MPI-AMRVAC code, in which the dust species are represented by
several pressureless dust fluids. The evolution of the model is followed well
into the nonlinear phase. The output of these simulations is then used as input
for the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to obtain infrared images at several
stages of the evolution, which can be compared to the observations. Results: We
confirm that a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is able to develop in the
proposed setup, and that the formation of the instability is not inhibited by
the addition of dust. Kelvin-Helmholtz billows form at the end of the linear
phase, and synthetic observations of the billows show striking similarities to
the infrared observations. It is pointed out that the high density dust regions
preferentially collect on the flanks of the billows. To get agreement with the
observed Kelvin-Helmholtz ripples, the assumed geometry between the background
radiation, the billows and the observer is seen to be of critical importance.

inevitably evolve over time whereas there is no corresponding ubiquitous
translation over space. The asymmetry, which is presumed to be elemental, is
represented by equations of motion and conservation laws that operate
differently over time and space. If, however, the asymmetry was found to be due
to deeper causes, this conventional view of time evolution would need
reworking. Here we show, using a sum-over-paths formalism, that a violation of
time reversal (T) symmetry might be such a cause. If T symmetry is obeyed, the
formalism treats time and space symmetrically such that states of matter are
localised both in space and in time. In this case, equations of motion and
conservation laws are undefined or inapplicable. However if T symmetry is
violated, the same sum over paths formalism yields states that are localised in
space and distributed without bound over time, creating an asymmetry between
time and space. Moreover, the states satisfy an equation of motion (the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation) and conservation laws apply. This suggests that the
time-space asymmetry is not elemental as currently presumed, and that T
violation may have a deep connection with time evolution.

Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv093",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has recently been suggested that, in the field, $\sim\!\!56\%$ of Sun-like
stars ($0.8\,{\rm M}_{_\odot}\lesssim M_\star\lesssim 1.2\,{\rm M}_{_\odot}$)
are single. We argue here that this suggestion may be incorrect, since it
appears to be based on the multiplicity frequency of systems with Sun-like
primaries, and therefore takes no account of Sun-like stars that are secondary
(or higher-order) components in multiple systems. When these components are
included in the reckoning, it seems likely that only $\sim\!46\%$ of Sun-like
stars are single. This estimate is based on a model in which the system mass
function has the form proposed by Chabrier, with a power-law Salpeter extension
to high masses; there is a flat distribution of mass ratios; and the
probability that a system of mass $M$ is a binary is $\,0.50 +
0.46\log_{_{10}}\!\left(M/{\rm M}_{_\odot}\right)\,$ for $\,0.08\,{\rm

this last relation are chosen so that the model also reproduces the observed
variation of multiplicity frequency with primary mass. However, the more
qualitative conclusion, that a minority of Sun-like stars are single, holds up
for virtually all reasonable values of the model parameters. Parenthetically,
it is still likely that the majority of {\it all} stars in the field are
single, but that is because most M Dwarfs probably are single.

suggested routes to players and set tolls as a function of reported demands.
However, players can choose to ignore or misreport their type to this mediator.
Using techniques from differential privacy, we show how to design a weak
mediator such that it is an asymptotic ex-post Nash equilibrium for all players

suggestion, and that when they do, they end up playing a nearly optimal flow.
Notably, our solution works in settings of incomplete information even in the

Attack-resistance, of a computer program running together with a defense
mechanism w.r.t a non-exploitability specification. In our setting, a program
may contain exploitable vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, but
appropriate defense mechanisms built into the program or the operating system
render such vulnerabilities hard to exploit by certain attackers, usually
relying on the strength of the randomness of a probabilistic transformation of
the environment or the program and some knowledge on the attacker's goals and
attack strategy. We are motivated by the reality that most large-scale programs
have vulnerabilities despite our best efforts to get rid of them. Security
researchers have responded to this state of affairs by coming up with ingenious
defense mechanisms such as address space layout randomization (ASLR) or
instruction set randomization (ISR) that provide some protection against
exploitation. However, implementations of such mechanism have been often shown
to be insecure, even against the attacks they were designed to prevent. By
formalizing this notion of attack-resistance we pave the way towards addressing
the questions: ""How do we formally analyze defense mechanisms? Is there a
mathematical way of distinguishing effective defense mechanisms from
ineffective ones? Can we quantify and show that these defense mechanisms
provide formal security guarantees, albeit partial, even in the presence of
exploitable vulnerabilities?"". To illustrate our approach we discuss under
which circumstances ISR implementations comply with the Attack-resistance
definition.

escape through a minority of solid angles with near complete transparency, with
the remaining majority of the solid angles largely opaque, resulting in a very

photons of a galaxy observed along a line of sight merely represents the
properties of the interstellar medium along that line of sight, which may be an
ill-representation of true escape fraction of the galaxy averaged over its full
sky. Here we study how Lyman continuum photons escape from galaxies at $z=4-6$,
utilizing high-resolution large-scale cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations. We compute the PDF of the mean escape fraction ($\left<f_{\rm
esc,1D}\right>$) averaged over mock observational samples, as a function of the
sample size, compared to the true mean (had you an infinite sample size). We
find that, when the sample size is small, the apparent mean skews to the low
end. For example, for a true mean of 6.7%, an observational sample of (2,10,50)
galaxies at $z=4$ would have have 2.5% probability of obtaining the sample mean
lower than $\left<f_{\rm esc,1D}\right>=$(0.007%, 1.8%, 4.1%) and 2.5%
probability of obtaining the sample mean being greater than (43%, 18%, 11%).
Our simulations suggest that at least $\sim$ 100 galaxies should be stacked in

similarity of input samples in order to classify these samples, for instance.
Besides standard kernels such as Gaussian (i.e., radial basis function, RBF) or
polynomial kernels, there are also specific kernels tailored to consider
structure in the data for similarity assessment. In this article, we will
capture structure in data by means of probabilistic mixture density models, for
example Gaussian mixtures in the case of real-valued input spaces. From the
distance measures that are inherently contained in these models, e.g.,
Mahalanobis distances in the case of Gaussian mixtures, we derive a new kernel,
the responsibility weighted Mahalanobis (RWM) kernel. Basically, this kernel
emphasizes the influence of model components from which any two samples that
are compared are assumed to originate (that is, the ""responsible"" model
components). We will see that this kernel outperforms the RBF kernel and other
kernels capturing structure in data (such as the LAP kernel in Laplacian SVM)
in many applications where partially labeled data are available, i.e., for
semi-supervised training of SVM. Other key advantages are that the RWM kernel
can easily be used with standard SVM implementations and training algorithms
such as sequential minimal optimization, and heuristics known for the
parametrization of RBF kernels in a C-SVM can easily be transferred to this new
kernel. Properties of the RWM kernel are demonstrated with 20 benchmark data
sets and an increasing percentage of labeled samples in the training data.

procedures. With help of this solutions we finally introduce a bunch of
differentials associated to the considered symmetries.

electricity around the world. As wind and solar technologies gradually begin to
supplant the use of fossil fuels as preferred means of energy production, new
challenges are emerging which are unique to the experience of decentralized
power generation. One such challenge is the development of effective monitoring
technologies to relay diagnostic information from remote energy systems to data
analysis centers. The ability to easily obtain, synthesize, and evaluate data
pertaining to the behavior of a potentially vast number of individual power
sources is of critical importance to the maintainability of the next generation
of intelligent grid infrastructure. However, the application space of remote
monitoring extends well beyond this. This paper details the development and
implementation of an open-source monitoring framework for remote solar energy
systems. The necessity for such a framework to be open is much better
understood when considered through the lens of the theoretical potential for
remote monitoring technologies in developing countries. The United States and
other industrialized nations in the so-called 'first world' are likely to be
slow to seriously adopt renewable energy on account of the massive investment
and infrastructural changes required for its integration into the existing
electrical grid. In countries where grid infrastructure is generally inadequate
or nonexistent, this barrier is far less of a concern, and renewable energy
technologies are viewed more as an enabling tool for progress than as a
disruptive and expensive technological tangent. In this context as well, remote
monitoring has a role to play.

across a wide range of wavelength regimes, but the precise origin of the
variability at different wavelengths remains unclear. To investigate the
relatively unexplored near-IR variability of the most luminous AGNs, we conduct
a search for variability using well sampled JHKs-band light curves from the
2MASS survey calibration fields. Our sample includes 27 known quasars with an
average of 924 epochs of observation over three years, as well as one
spectroscopically confirmed blazar (SDSSJ14584479+3720215) with 1972 epochs of
data. This is the best-sampled NIR photometric blazar light curve to date, and
it exhibits correlated, stochastic variability that we characterize with
continuous auto-regressive moving average (CARMA) models. None of the other 26
known quasars had detectable variability in the 2MASS bands above the
photometric uncertainty. A blind search of the 2MASS calibration field light
curves for AGN candidates based on fitting CARMA(1,0) models (damped-random
walk) uncovered only 7 candidates. All 7 were young stellar objects within the
{\rho} Ophiuchus star forming region, five with previous X-ray detections. A
significant {\gamma}-ray detection (5{\sigma}) for the known blazar using 4.5
years of Fermi photon data is also found. We suggest that strong NIR
variability of blazars, such as seen for SDSSJ14584479+3720215, can be used as
an efficient method of identifying previously-unidentified {\gamma}-ray
blazars, with low contamination from other AGN.

a constant magnetic field in the long wavelength approximation with random
binary disorder, by solving the Soven equation self-consistently. Density of
state contributions for different valleys in each sublattice sites are obtained
for different values of magnetic field strength showing remarkable differences
between K and K' valleys. A band gap is obtained by an asymmetric on-site
impurity concentration and the graphene electrons acquire an anomalous magnetic
moment, which is opposite in different valleys, which depend highly in the
interplay between the impurity band, the band edges and the broadening of the
Landau levels. In turn, magnetization as a function of B for different on-site
random impurities is computed showing that by decreasing the on-site impurity
energy values, maximum magnetization is shifted towards higher values of B
which can be used to create and manipulate polarized valley currents. Finally,
conductivity and local vertex function are obtained as a function of energy
showing that scattering contributions from A and B sublattices differ
significantly. Effective medium local two-irreducible vertex is computed
showing that scattering from sublattices A and B do not contribute equally,
which can be related to weak anti-localization. From these results, it could be
possible to explore how the valley pseudospin can be used to create polarized
currents by populating asymmetrically the sublattice sites, where the
population can be tuned with the applied magnetic field strength.

  Neural Systems","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural oscillations are universal phenomena and can be observed at different
levels of neural systems, from single neuron to macroscopic brain. The
frequency of those oscillations are related to the brain functions. However,
little is know about how the oscillating frequency of neural system affects
neural information transmission in them. In this paper, we investigated how the
signal processing in single neuron is modulated by subthreshold membrane
potential oscillation generated by upstream rhythmic neural activities. We
found that the high frequency oscillations facilitate the transferring of
strong signals, whereas slow oscillations the weak signals. Though the capacity
of information convey for weak signal is low in single neuron, it is greatly
enhanced when weak signals are transferred by multiple pathways with different
oscillation phases. We provided a simple phase plane analysis to explain the
mechanism for this stimulus-dependent frequency modulation in the leakage
integrate-and-fire neuron model. Those results provided a basic understanding
of how the brain could modulate its information processing simply through
oscillating frequency.
