concept in sociology and social network analysis. The importance of social
hierarchy in a social network is that the topological structure of the social
hierarchy is essential in both shaping the nature of social interactions
between individuals and unfolding the structure of the social networks. The
social hierarchy found in a social network can be utilized to improve the
accuracy of link prediction, provide better query results, rank web pages, and
study information flow and spread in complex networks. In this paper, we model
a social network as a directed graph G, and consider the social hierarchy as
DAG (directed acyclic graph) of G, denoted as GD. By DAG, all the vertices in G
can be partitioned into different levels, the vertices at the same level
represent a disjoint group in the social hierarchy, and all the edges in DAG
follow one direction. The main issue we study in this paper is how to find DAG
GD in G. The approach we take is to find GD by removing all possible cycles
from G such that G = U(G) + GD where U(G) is a maximum Eulerian subgraph which
contains all possible cycles. We give the reasons for doing so, investigate the
properties of GD found, and discuss the applications. In addition, we develop a
novel two-phase algorithm, called Greedy-&-Refine, which greedily computes an
Eulerian subgraph and then refines this greedy solution to find the maximum
Eulerian subgraph. We give a bound between the greedy solution and the optimal.
The quality of our greedy approach is high. We conduct comprehensive
experimental studies over 14 real-world datasets. The results show that our
algorithms are at least two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline
algorithm.

and two final-reconstruction step (FRS) algorithms are proposed for the
implementation of bivariate AI-encoded 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT). The
architecture directly realizes an error-free 2-D DCT without using FRSs between
row-column transforms, leading to an 8$\times$8 2-D DCT which is entirely free
of quantization errors in AI basis. As a result, the user-selectable accuracy
for each of the coefficients in the FRS facilitates each of the 64 coefficients
to have its precision set independently of others, avoiding the leakage of
quantization noise between channels as is the case for published DCT designs.
The proposed FRS uses two approaches based on (i) optimized Dempster-Macleod
multipliers and (ii) expansion factor scaling. This architecture enables
low-noise high-dynamic range applications in digital video processing that
requires full control of the finite-precision computation of the 2-D DCT. The
proposed architectures and FRS techniques are experimentally verified and
validated using hardware implementations that are physically realized and
verified on FPGA chip. Six designs, for 4- and 8-bit input word sizes, using
the two proposed FRS schemes, have been designed, simulated, physically
implemented and measured. The maximum clock rate and block-rate achieved among
8-bit input designs are 307.787 MHz and 38.47 MHz, respectively, implying a

distribution function (VDF) of the Galactic DM halo. We present an angular
basis for the DM VDF which can be used to parametrise the distribution in order
to mitigate astrophysical uncertainties in future directional experiments and
extract information about the DM halo. This basis consists of discretising the
VDF in a series of angular bins, with the VDF being only a function of the DM
speed $v$ within each bin. In contrast to other methods, such as spherical
harmonic expansions, the use of this basis allows us to guarantee that the
resulting VDF is everywhere positive and therefore physical. We present a
recipe for calculating the event rates corresponding to the discrete VDF for an
arbitrary number of angular bins $N$ and investigate the discretisation error
which is introduced in this way. For smooth, Standard Halo Model-like
distribution functions, only $N=3$ angular bins are required to achieve an
accuracy of around $10-30\%$ in the number of events in each bin. Shortly after
confirmation of the DM origin of the signal with around 50 events, this
accuracy should be sufficient to allow the discretised velocity distribution to
be employed reliably. For more extreme VDFs (such as streams), the
discretisation error is typically much larger, but can be improved with
increasing $N$. This method paves the way towards an astrophysics-independent
analysis framework for the directional detection of dark matter.

developed for finding a small group of covariates that are associated with the
response from a large pool. Can the discoveries from these data mining
approaches be spurious due to high dimensionality and limited sample size? Can
our fundamental assumptions about the exogeneity of the covariates needed for
such variable selection be validated with the data? To answer these questions,
we need to derive the distributions of the maximum spurious correlations given
a certain number of predictors, namely, the distribution of the correlation of
a response variable $Y$ with the best $s$ linear combinations of $p$ covariates
$\mathbf{X}$, even when $\mathbf{X}$ and $Y$ are independent. When the
covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}$ possesses the restricted eigenvalue property,
we derive such distributions for both a finite $s$ and a diverging $s$, using
Gaussian approximation and empirical process techniques. However, such a
distribution depends on the unknown covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}$. Hence,
we use the multiplier bootstrap procedure to approximate the unknown
distributions and establish the consistency of such a simple bootstrap
approach. The results are further extended to the situation where the residuals
are from regularized fits. Our approach is then used to construct the upper
confidence limit for the maximum spurious correlation and to test the
exogeneity of the covariates. The former provides a baseline for guarding
against false discoveries and the latter tests whether our fundamental
assumptions for high-dimensional model selection are statistically valid. Our
techniques and results are illustrated with both numerical examples and real

of lifting, this nonconvex problem may be convexified into a semidefinite
rank-one matrix recovery problem, known as PhaseLift. Under a linear number of
exact Gaussian measurements, PhaseLift recovers the unknown vector exactly with
high probability. Under noisy measurements, the solution to a variant of
PhaseLift has error proportional to the $\ell_1$ norm of the noise. In the

with noise and gross, arbitrary corruptions. We prove that PhaseLift can
tolerate a small, fixed fraction of gross errors, even in the highly

literature. Specifically, the rank penalization through a trace term is
unnecessary, and the resulting optimization program has no parameters that need
to be chosen. The present work also achieves the information theoretically
optimal scaling of $O(n)$ measurements without the additional logarithmic
factors that appear in existing general robust PCA results.

removed from laboratories or field sites with special arrangements for
scientific research. But digital online resources provide a novel opportunity
for large scale efforts to bridge the real world and laboratory settings which
support data collection and randomized A/B experiments comparing different
versions of content or interactions [2]. However, there are substantial
technological and practical barriers in aligning instructors and researchers to
use learning technologies like blended lessons/exercises & MOOCs as both a
service for students and a realistic context to conduct research. This paper
explains how the concept of a MOOClet can facilitate research-practitioner
collaborations. MOOClets [3] are defined as modular components of a digital
resource that can be implemented in technology to: (1) allow modification to
create multiple versions, (2) allow experimental comparison and personalization
of different versions, (3) reliably specify what data are collected. We suggest
a framework in which instructors specify what kinds of changes to lessons,
exercises, and emails they would be willing to adopt, and what data they will
collect and make available. Researchers can then: (1) specify or design
experiments that compare the effects of different versions on quantifiable
outcomes. (2) Explore algorithms for maximizing particular outcomes by choosing
alternative versions of a MOOClet based on the input variables available. We
present a prototype survey tool for instructors intended to facilitate
practitioner researcher matches and successful collaborations.

tweets. To this end, we took a global sample of 200 universities and compiled
all the tweets with hyperlinks to any of these institutions. Further link data
was obtained from alternative sources (MajesticSEO and OpenSiteExplorer) in
order to compare the results. Thereafter, various statistical tests were
performed to determine the correlation between the indicators and the ability
to predict external links from the collected tweets. The results indicate a
high volume of tweets, although they are skewed by the presence and performance
of specific universities and countries. The data provided by Topsy correlated
significantly with all link indicators, particularly with OpenSiteExplorer

high error rates, which fall slightly in nonlinear models applied to specific
environments. We conclude that the use of Twitter (via Topsy) as a source of
hyperlinks to universities produces promising results due to its high
correlation with link indicators, though limited by policies and culture

This work uses qualitative and quantitative methods to explore how students are
motivated to engage in physics and how they feel about themselves while
engaging in physics. The collection of four studies in this dissertation
culminates in a sociocultural perspective on motivation and identity. This
perspective uses two extremes of how students experience physics as a lens for
understanding motivation: fear and self-preservation versus integrity and
self-expression. Rather than viewing motivation as a property of the student,
or viewing students as inherently interested or disinterested in physics, the
theoretical perspective on motivation and identity helps examine features of
the learning environments that determine how students experience themselves
through physics class. This perspective highlights the importance of feeling a
sense of belonging in the context of physics and the power that teachers have
in shaping student motivations through the construction of their classroom
learning environments. Findings demonstrate how different ways that students
experience themselves in physics class impact their performance and interest in
physics. This dissertation concludes with a set of design principles that can
foster integration and integrity among students in physics learning

solar abundances or the individual stellar abundances. Unlike the solar corona
where low FIP elements are enriched, in these stars the FIP effect is
consistently due to a depletion of high FIP elements with respect to actual
photospheric abundances. Comparing to solar abundances (instead of stellar)
yields the same fractionation trend as on the Sun. In both cases a similar FIP
bias is inferred, but different fractionation mechanisms need to be invoked.

behavior is one of the central goals of neuroscience. Here we characterize the
information flow through a complete sensorimotor circuit: from stimulus, to
sensory neurons, to interneurons, to motor neurons, to muscles, to motion.
Specifically, we apply a recently developed framework for quantifying
information flow to a previously published ensemble of models of salt
klinotaxis in the nematode worm C. elegans. The models are grounded in the
neuroanatomy and currently known neurophysiology of the worm. The unknown model
parameters were optimized to reproduce the worm's behavior. Information flow
analysis reveals several key principles underlying how the models operate: (1)
Interneuron class AIY is responsible for integrating information about positive
and negative changes in concentration, and exhibits a strong left/right
information asymmetry. (2) Gap junctions play a crucial role in the transfer of
information responsible for the information symmetry observed in interneuron
class AIZ. (3) Neck motor neuron class SMB implements an information gating
mechanism that underlies the circuit's state-dependent response. (4) The neck
carries non-uniform distribution about changes in concentration. Thus, not all
directions of movement are equally informative. Each of these findings
corresponds to an experimental prediction that could be tested in the worm to
greatly refine our understanding of the neural circuit underlying klinotaxis.
Information flow analysis also allows us to explore how information flow
relates to underlying electrophysiology. Despite large variations in the neural
parameters of individual circuits, the overall information flow architecture
circuit is remarkably consistent across the ensemble, suggesting that
information flow analysis captures general principles of operation for the
klinotaxis circuit.

  Democracy is a relevant property which naturally shows up when we deal with
opinion dynamic models and cooperative algorithms such as consensus over a
network: it says that each agent's measure/opinion is going to play a
negligeable role in the asymptotic behavior of the global system. It can be
seen as a relaxation of average consensus, where all agents have exactly the

measures the difference of the squared distances of these points to the conic,

in that case the ultra fast OoC-rule selects the candidate point. This

synchronization vastly reduces the network traffic generated by traditional
PageRank algorithms, thus greatly reducing the per-iteration cost of PageRank.
On the other hand, this partial synchronization also creates dependencies

innovation is the analysis of the correlations introduced by this partial
synchronization process and a bound establishing that our approximation is
close to the true PageRank vector.

  Given a maximal monotone operator $A$, the evolution is governed by the time
dependent operator $I -(I + \lambda(t) {A})^{-1}$, where the positive control
parameter $\lambda(t)$ tends to infinity as $t \to + \infty$. The tuning of $
\lambda (\cdot) $ is done in a closed-loop way, by resolution of the algebraic
equation $\lambda \norm{(I + \lambda {A})^{-1}x -x}=\theta$, where $\theta $ is
a positive given constant. The existence and uniqueness of a strong global
solution for the Cauchy problem follows from Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem. We prove
the weak convergence of the trajectories to equilibria, and superlinear
convergence under an error bound condition. When $A =\partial f$ is the
subdifferential of a closed convex function $f$, we show a $\bigo(1/t^2)$
convergence property of $f(x(t))$ to the infimal value of the problem. Then, we
introduce proximal-like algorithms which can be obtained by time discretization
of the continuous dynamic, and which share the same fast convergence
properties. As distinctive features, we allow a relative error tolerance for
the solution of the proximal subproblem similar to the ones proposed in
~\cite{So-Sv1, So-Sv2}, and a large step condition, as proposed
in~\cite{MS1,MS2}. For general convex minimization problems, the complexity is
$\bigo(1/n^2)$. In the regular case, we show the global quadratic convergence

of polarized electron flow with various spin directions relative to the applied
magnetic field ($\mathbf{H}$), and brings about the SMR effect finally. The
magnetic insulator layer, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG), is not a requisite
for the observation of SMR. Instead, the SMR effect is perfectly realized, with
an order of magnitude increase, in the sample with a discontinuous layer of
isolated-Co$_2$FeAl (0.3 nm) grains covered by 2.5-nm-thick Pt layer on MgO
substrate. The model intuitively gives the typical relationship of SMR effect,

$\rho_{\parallel}$ and $\rho_{T}$ are longitudinal reisitivities with applied
magnetic field ($\mathbf{H}$) direction perpendicular to the current direction
out of plane (as Z direction), parallel with and perpendicular to it in plane

between polarized and nonpolarized conduction electrons is the origin of SMR,

molecular mechanism of aging, a quantitative link between the dynamics of
damage accumulation and mortality of species has so far remained elusive. To
address this question, we examine stability properties of a generic gene
regulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many characteristics of aging and
the associated population mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the
critical dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on the
analysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in
Drosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly
critical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in
the form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and
causes the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a
form of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life mortality
deceleration observed at very late ages for large populations. We show that
aging contains a stochastic component, related to accumulation of regulatory
errors in transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to imperfection of
signaling cascades in the network and of responses to environmental factors. We
also establish that there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting
genetic control. Since mortality in humans, where it is characterized best, is
strongly associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, our findings
support the idea that aging is the driving force behind the development of
chronic human diseases.

the excess of helium above the burning shell, the result of the contraction of
the convective core during core hydrogen burning, has the effect of making such
stars redder and larger than they would be otherwise. The outward motion of the
burning shell in mass removes this excess and triggers the loop. Hitherto
nobody has attempted to demonstrate why the excess helium has this effect. We
consider the effect of the local opacity, which is reduced by excess helium,
the shell fuel supply, which is also reduced, and the local mean molecular
weight, which is increased. We demonstrate that the mean molecular weight is
the decisive reddening factor. The opacity has a much smaller effect and a
reduced fuel supply actually favours blueward motion.

problem when there is a hole in the routing area. It depends on other
strategies such as perimeter routing to find a detour path, which can be long
and result in inefficiency of the routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a
new approach called Intermediate Target based Geographic Routing (ITGR) to
solve the long detour path problem. The basic idea is to use previous
experience to determine the destination areas that are shaded by the holes. The
novelty of the approach is that a single forwarding path can be used to
determine a shaded area that may cover many destination nodes. We design an
efficient method for the source to find out whether a destination node belongs
to a shaded area. The source then selects an intermediate node as the tentative
target and greedily forwards packets to it, which in turn forwards the packet
to the final destination by greedy routing. ITGR can combine multiple shaded
areas to improve the efficiency of representation and routing. We perform
simulations and demonstrate that ITGR significantly reduces the routing path
length, compared with existing geographic routing protocols.

networks. While characteristic motif distribution have been found in many
networks, very little is known today about the evolution of network motifs.
This paper studies the most important motifs in social networks, triangles, and
how directed triangle motifs change over time. Our chosen subject is one of the
largest Online Social Networks, Google+. Google+ has two distinguishing
features that make it particularly interesting: (1) it is a directed network,
which yields a rich set of triangle motifs, and (2) it is a young and fast
evolving network, whose role in the OSN space is still not fully understood.
For the purpose of this study, we crawled the network over a time period of six
weeks, collecting several snapshots. We find that some triangle types display
significant dynamics, e.g., for some specific initial types, up to 20% of the
instances evolve to other types. Due to the fast growth of the OSN in the
observed time period, many new triangles emerge. We also observe that many
triangles evolve into less-connected motifs (with less edges), suggesting that
growth also comes with pruning. We complement the topological study by also
considering publicly available user profile data (mostly geographic locations).
The corresponding results shed some light on the semantics of the triangle
motifs. Indeed, we find that users in more symmetric triangle motifs live
closer together, indicating more personal relationships. In contrast,
asymmetric links in motifs often point to faraway users with a high in-degree
(celebrities).

rotating system measured with the M\""ossbauer effect has been recently first
re-analyzed and then replied [1,2]. The results have shown that a correct
re-processing of K\""undig's experimental data gives a deviation of a relative
redshift between emission and absorption resonant lines from the prediction due
to relativistic dilatation of time, which, at first-order in
\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}, gives a redshift \frac{\nabla
E}{E}\simeq-\frac{1}{2}\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} where v is the tangential velocity
of the absorber of resonant radiationa and c is the velocity of light in
vacuum. Data re-processing gave \frac{\nabla E}{E}\simeq-k\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}
with k=0.596\pm0.006. Subsequent new experimental results [2] have shown a
redshift with k=0.68\pm0.03 instead. Using Einstein Equivalence Principle on
the equivalence between the gravitational ""force"" and the pseudo-force
experienced by an observer in a rotating frame of reference, here we re-analyze
the theoretical framework of M\""ossbauer rotor experiments directly in the
rotating frame through a general relativistic treatment. We show that previous
analyses missed an important effect of clock synchronization and that the
correct general relativistic prevision in the rotating frame gives
k\simeq\frac{2}{3} in perfect agreement with the new experimental results. Such
an effect of clock synchronization has been missed in various papers in the
literature with some subsequent claim of invalidity of relativity theory and/or
some attempts to explain the experimental results through ""exotic"" effects. Our
general relativistic interpretation shows, instead, that the new experimental
results of the M\""ossbauer rotor experiment are a new, strong and independent,
proof of general relativity. Finally, we discuss an analogy with the use of
general relativity in Global Positioning Systems.

contribute in postulates of quantum mechanics. Here we argue that logical,
mathematical, and observational evidence require that symmetry should be
considered as a fundamental concept in the construction of physical systems.
Based on this idea, we propose a series of postulates for describing quantum
systems, and establish their relation and correspondence with axioms of
standard quantum mechanics. Through some examples we show that this
reformulation helps better understand some of ambiguities of standard
description. Nonetheless its application is not limited to explaining confusing
concept and it may be a necessary step toward a consistent model of quantum
cosmology and gravity.

problem of finding a bounded cost set of nodes S such that the influence
spreading from S in G, within a given time bound, is as large as possible. The
dynamic that governs the spread of influence is the following: initially only
elements in S are influenced; subsequently at each round, the set of influenced
elements is augmented by all nodes in the network that have a sufficiently
large number of already influenced neighbors. We prove that the problem is
NP-hard, even in simple networks like complete graphs and trees. We also derive
a series of positive results. We present exact pseudo-polynomial time
algorithms for general trees, that become polynomial time in case the trees are
unweighted. This last result improves on previously published results. We also
design polynomial time algorithms for general weighted paths and cycles, and
for unweighted complete graphs.

of the fractional calculus. This paper is a review of physical models that look
very promising for future development of fractional dynamics. We suggest a
short introduction to fractional calculus as a theory of integration and
differentiation of non-integer order. Some applications of
