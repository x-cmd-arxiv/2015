(FFHT), was recently introduced and a number of promising applications on the
design of efficient multiple access systems and multilevel spread spectrum
sequences were proposed. The FFHT exhibits interesting symmetries, which are
exploited to derive tailored fast transform algorithms. The proposed fast
algorithms are based on successive decompositions of the FFHT by means of
Hadamard-Walsh transforms (HWT). The introduced decompositions meet the lower
bound on the multiplicative complexity for all the cases investigated. The
complexity of the new algorithms is compared with that of traditional

significantly increase network capacity. The gain obtained by network
densification for fixed terminals have been studied and proved. However for

packet loss due to high mobility, interference management and so on. The
conventional solutions are to handover high speed mobiles to macro base

to exploit the capacity of dense networks and overuse the backhaul capacity. In
this paper we propose a set of solutions to systematically solve the technical
challenges of mobile dense networks. We introduce network architecture together
with data transmission protocols to support mobile users. A software-defined

solutions can significantly boost performance of dense networks and simplify
the packet handling process. Importantly, the gain brought by network

Flows project, which has consistently reanalyzed archival galaxy HI profiles,
and 3.6$\mu$m photometry obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, with which
we can measure stellar mass, we use the baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF)
relationship to explore whether these massive galaxies are distinct. We discuss
several results, but the most striking is the systematic offset of the
HI-massive sample above the BTF. These galaxies have both more gas and more
stars in their disks than the typical disk galaxy of similar rotational
velocity. The ""condensed"" baryon fraction, $f_C$, the fraction of the baryons
in a dark matter halo that settle either as cold gas or stars into the disk, is
twice as high in the HI-massive sample than typical, and almost reaches the
universal baryon fraction in some cases, suggesting that the most extreme of
these galaxies have little in the way of a hot baryonic component or cold
baryons distributed well outside the disk. In contrast, the star formation
efficiency, measured as the ratio of the mass in stars to that in both stars
and gas, shows no difference between the HI-massive sample and the typical disk
galaxies. We conclude that the star formation efficiency is driven by an
internal, self-regulating process, while $f_C$ is affected by external factors.
We also found that the most massive HI detected galaxies are located
preferentially in filaments. We present the first evidence of an environmental
effect on galaxy evolution using a dynamical definition of a filament.

performed a 3D radiation-MHD simulation of a network region, and computed
synthetic \Halpha\ images from this simulation to investigate the relation
between fibrils and the magnetic field lines in the chromosphere. The periods,
amplitudes and phase-speeds of the synthetic fibrils are consistent with those
observed. We analyse the relation between the synthetic fibrils and the field
lines threading through them, and find that some fibrils trace out the same
field line along the fibril's length, but there are also fibrils that sample
different field lines at different locations along their length. Fibrils sample
the same field lines on a time scale of $\sim200$~s. This is shorter than their
own lifetime. We analysed the evolution of the atmosphere along a number of
field lines that thread through fibrils and find that they carry slow-mode
waves that load mass into the field line, as well as transverse waves that
propagate with the Alfv\'en speed. Transverse waves propagating in opposite
directions cause an interference pattern with complex apparent phase speeds.
The relationship between fibrils and field lines is complex. It is governed by
constant migration and swaying of the field lines, their mass loading by slow
modes and subsequent draining, and their actual visibility in \Halpha. Field
lines are visible where they lie close to the optical depth unity surface. The
location of the latter is governed by the height at which the column mass in
the chromosphere reaches a certain value. We conclude that using the swaying
motion of fibrils as a tracer of chromospheric transverse oscillations must be
done with caution.

based on shrinkage covariance estimation. The forecast ensemble members at each
step are used to estimate the background error covariance matrix via the
Rao-Blackwell Ledoit and Wolf estimator, which has been developed specifically
developed to approximate high-dimensional covariance matrices using a small
number of samples. Additional samples are taken from the normal distribution
described by the background ensemble mean and the estimated background
covariance matrix in order to increase the size of the ensemble and reduce the
sampling error of the filter. This increase in the size of the ensemble is
obtained without running the forward model. After the assimilation step, the
additional samples are discarded and only the initial members are propagated.
Two implementations are considered. In the EnKF Full-Space (EnKF-FS) approach
the assimilation process is performed in the model space, while the EnKF
Reduce-Space (EnKF-RS) formulation performs the analysis in the subspace
spanned by the ensemble members. Numerical experiments carried out with a
quasi-geostrophic model show that the proposed implementations outperform
current methods such as the traditional EnKF formulation, square root filters,
and inflation-free EnKF implementations. The proposed implementations provide
good results with small ensemble sizes ($\sim 10$) and small percentages of
observed components from the vector state. These results are similar (and in
some cases better) to traditional methods using large ensemble sizes ($\sim
80$) and large percentages of observed components. The computational times of
the new implementations remain reasonably low.

prefers a slightly positive tilt ($n_t = 0.06^{+0.63}_{-0.89}$) and a negative
running ($n_{t, {\rm run}} < -0.22$) for the tensor power spectrum spectrum.
Interestingly, the addition of direct gravitational wave detector data alone
puts strong bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r < 0.2$ since the large
positive tensor tilt preferred by the \textit{Planck} temperature power
spectrum is no longer allowed. Adding the recently released BICEP2/KECK and

understanding natural video content. Extracting robust and effective features
is a crucial step towards solving these problems. However the existing
approaches suffer from the sensitivity to either varying illumination, or
viewpoint changing, or even camera motion, and/or the lack of spatial
information. Inspired by the success of deep structures in image
classification, we attempt to leverage a deep structure to extract feature for
dynamic texture and scene classification. To tackle with the challenges in
training a deep structure, we propose to transfer some prior knowledge from
image domain to video domain. To be specific, we propose to apply a
well-trained Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) as a mid-level feature
extractor to extract features from each frame, and then form a representation
of a video by concatenating the first and the second order statistics over the
mid-level features. We term this two-level feature extraction scheme as a
Transferred ConvNet Feature (TCoF). Moreover we explore two different
implementations of the TCoF scheme, i.e., the \textit{spatial} TCoF and the
\textit{temporal} TCoF, in which the mean-removed frames and the difference
between two adjacent frames are used as the inputs of the ConvNet,
respectively. We evaluate systematically the proposed spatial TCoF and the
temporal TCoF schemes on three benchmark data sets, including DynTex, YUPENN,
and Maryland, and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields superior
performance.

observationally-deduced plasma density and temperature, these magnetic field
measurements offer a straightforward way of tracking evolution of the magnetic
and thermal energies in the flare. For the event described here, the magnetic
energy density in the radio-emitting volume declines over the flare rise phase,
then stays roughly constant during the extended peak phase, but recovers to the
original level over the decay phase. At the stage where the magnetic energy
density decreases, the thermal energy density increases; however, this increase
is insufficient, by roughly an order of magnitude, to compensate for the
magnetic energy decrease. When the magnetic energy release is over, the source
parameters come back to nearly their original values. We discuss possible

clustering. Recent work demonstrated that high-quality clusters can be
generated by representing the data points using high-dimensional vectors that
reflect textual content and social network information. Due to the high cost of
similarity computation, sequential implementations of even single-pass
algorithms cannot keep up with the speed of real-world streams. This paper
presents our efforts to meet the constraints of real-time social stream
clustering through parallelization. We focus on two system-level issues. Most
stream processing engines like Apache Storm organize distributed workers in the
form of a directed acyclic graph, making it difficult to dynamically
synchronize the state of parallel workers. We tackle this challenge by creating
a separate synchronization channel using a pub-sub messaging system. Due to the
sparsity of the high-dimensional vectors, the size of centroids grows quickly
as new data points are assigned to the clusters. Traditional synchronization
that directly broadcasts cluster centroids becomes too expensive and limits the
scalability of the parallel algorithm. We address this problem by communicating
only dynamic changes of the clusters rather than the whole centroid vectors.
Our algorithm under Cloud DIKW can process the Twitter 10% data stream in
real-time with 96-way parallelism. By natural improvements to Cloud DIKW,
including advanced collective communication techniques developed in our Harp
project, we will be able to process the full Twitter stream in real-time with
1000-way parallelism. Our use of powerful general software subsystems will
enable many other applications that need integration of streaming and batch

is seen by a pedestrian in a large region of downtown Chicago and saved all
coordinates and orientation data to be used for confining our search region.
Prior knowledge from approximate position of query image is leveraged to
address complexity and accuracy issues of our search in a large scale
geo-tagged data set. One key aspect that differentiates our work is that it
utilizes the sensor information of GPS SOS and the camera orientation in
improving localization. Finally we demonstrate retrieval-based technique are
less accurate in sparse open areas compared with purely GPS measurement. The
effectiveness of our approach is discussed in detail and experimental results
show improved performance when compared with regular approaches.

both monochromatic (at 70$\mu$m) and bolometric (between $8-1000~\mu$m)
emission in the FIR. To probe the nature of the correlation up to $z\sim1.2$,
where direct detection of blue star-forming galaxies is impossible with current
technology, we employ the technique of image stacking at 0.325 and 1.4 GHz in
the radio and in six infrared bands, viz. 24, 70, 160, 250, 350 and $500~\mu$m.
For comparison, we also study the correlation for more luminous galaxies that
are directly detected. The stacking analysis allows us to probe the radio--FIR
correlation for galaxies that are up to 2 orders of magnitude fainter than the
ones detected directly. The $k-$correction in the infrared wavebands is
obtained by fitting the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) with a
composite mid-IR power law and a single temperature greybody model. We find
that the radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}$) is strongly correlated
with monochromatic FIR luminosity at 70 $\mu$m ($L_{\rm 70\mu m}$) having slope
$1.09\pm0.05$ and with bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm TIR}$) having slope

of the radio--FIR correlation. Within the uncertainties of our measurement and

And-Or graph model, to recognize object shapes in images. Our proposed model
consists of four layers: leaf-nodes at the bottom are local classifiers for
detecting contour fragments; or-nodes above the leaf-nodes function as the
switches to activate their child leaf-nodes, making the model reconfigurable
during inference; and-nodes in a higher layer capture holistic shape
deformations; one root-node on the top, which is also an or-node, activates one
of its child and-nodes to deal with large global variations (e.g. different

discriminatively train the And-Or model from weakly annotated data. This
algorithm iteratively determines the model structures (e.g. the nodes and their

our model demonstrates the effectiveness to perform robust shape-based object
detection against background clutter and outperforms the other state-of-the-art

tunneling of electrons between ferromagnetic and normal electrodes via an
impurity. The sensitivity of current to a weak external magnetic field stems
from a spin blockade, which, in turn, is enabled by strong on-site repulsion.
We demonstrate that this sensitivity exists even in the absence of repulsion
when a single-particle description applies. Within this description, we
calculate exactly the resonant-tunneling current between the electrodes. The
mechanism of magnetoresistance, completely different from the spin blocking,
has its origin in the interference of virtual tunneling amplitudes. Spin
imbalance in ferromagnetic electrode is responsible for this interference and
the resulting coupling of the Zeeman levels. This coupling also affects the

$M$ observations of the state. This approach shows that, for a given sample
size $M$, not all states observed in the sample can be distinguished. Rather,
only a partition of the sampled states $s$ can be resolved. Such partition
defines an {\em emergent} classification $q_s$ of the states that becomes finer
and finer as the sample size increases, through a process of {\em symmetry
breaking} between states. This allows us to distinguish between the
$resolution$ of a given representation of the observer defined states $s$,
which is given by the entropy of $s$, and its $relevance$ which is defined by
the entropy of the partition $q_s$. Relevance has a non-monotonic dependence on
resolution, for a given sample size. In addition, we characterise most relevant
samples and we show that they exhibit power law frequency distributions,
generally taken as signatures of ""criticality"". This suggests that
""criticality"" reflects the relevance of a given representation of the states of
a complex system, and does not necessarily require a specific mechanism of
self-organisation to a critical point.

exact representing degree over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_m$ (with the integer $m>2$)
as $d_m(f)$. Let $m=\Pi_{i=1}^{r}p_i^{e_i}$, where $p_i$'s are distinct primes,

Ky Fan norms of graphs generalize the concept of graph energy, so this question

promising for novel nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications. Phonons, as
one of the most important collective excitations, are at the heart for the
device performance, as their interactions with electrons and photons govern the
carrier mobility and light-emitting efficiency of the material. Here, through a
detailed first-principles study, it is demonstrated that monolayer phosphorene
exhibits a giant phononic anisotropy, and remarkably, this anisotropy is
squarely opposite to its electronic counterpart and can be tuned effectively by
strain engineering. By sampling the whole Brillouin zone for the mono-layer
phosphorene, several ""hidden"" directions are found, along which small-momentum
phonons are ""frozen"" with strain and possess the smallest degree of
anharmonicity. Unexpectedly, these ""hidden"" directions are intrinsically
different from those usually studied armchair and zigzag directions. Light is
also shed on the anisotropy of interlayer coupling of few-layer phosphorene by
examining the rigid-layer vibrations. These highly anisotropic and

applications in thermal management, thermoelectronics, nanoelectronics and

single-dish monitoring using Hokkaido University Tomakomai 11-m radio telescope
has shown that a systematic acceleration continues over four years beyond a
lifetime of individual maser features. This fact suggests that the H$_{2}$O
maser traces a region where molecular gas is steadily accelerated. There were
five maser flares during five-years monitoring, and maser distributions in four

maximizing a posteriori under the Bayesian framework, in which we integrate the
spatio-temporal contexts and the appearance models. The probabilistic inference
is achieved by a data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Given a
peroid of observed frames, the algorithm simulates a ergodic and aperiodic
Markov Chain, and it visits a sequence of solution states in the joint space of
spatial graph partitioning and temporal graph matching. In the experiments, our

(LRT) for testing high dimensional covariance matrix. Recently, the correct
asymptotic distribution of the LRT for a large-dimensional case (the case $p/n$
approaches to a constant $\gamma \in (0,1]$) is specified by researchers. The
correct procedure is named as corrected LRT. Despite of its correction, the
corrected LRT is a function of sample eigenvalues that are suffered from
redundant variability from high dimensionality and, subsequently, still does
not have full power in differentiating hypotheses on the covariance matrix. In
this paper, motivated by the successes of a linearly shrunken covariance matrix
estimator (simply shrinkage estimator) in various applications, we propose a
regularized LRT that uses, in defining the LRT, the shrinkage estimator instead
of the sample covariance matrix. We compute the asymptotic distribution of the
regularized LRT, when the true covariance matrix is the identity matrix and a
spiked covariance matrix. The obtained asymptotic results have applications in
testing various hypotheses on the covariance matrix. Here, we apply them to
testing the identity of the true covariance matrix, which is a long standing
problem in the literature, and show that the regularized LRT outperforms the
corrected LRT, which is its non-regularized counterpart. In addition, we
compare the power of the regularized LRT to those of recent non-likelihood
based procedures.

combines an analytic model for the halo mass accretion history (MAH), based on
extended Press Schechter (EPS) theory, with an empirical relation between
concentration and formation time obtained through fits to the results of
numerical simulations. Because the semi-analytic model is based on EPS theory,
it can be applied to wide ranges in mass, redshift and cosmology. The resulting
concentration-mass (c-M) relations are found to agree with the simulations, and
because the model applies only to relaxed halos, they do not exhibit the upturn
at high masses or high redshifts found by some recent works. We predict a
change of slope in the z=0 c-M relation at a mass scale of
$10^{11}\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We find that this is due to the change in the
functional form of the halo MAH, which goes from being dominated by an
exponential (for high-mass halos) to a power-law (for low-mass halos). During
the latter phase, the core radius remains approximately constant, and the
concentration grows due to the drop of the background density. We also analyse
how the c-M relation predicted by this work affects the power produced by dark
matter annihilation, finding that at z = 0 the power is two orders of magnitude
lower than that obtained from extrapolating best-fitting c-M relations. We

diffusion of awareness in multiplex networks. In the model, an infectious
disease can spread in one network representing the paths of epidemic spreading
(contact network), leading to the diffusion of awareness in the other network
(information network), and then the diffusion of awareness will cause
individuals to take social distances, which in turn affects the epidemic
spreading. As for the diffusion of awareness, we assume that, on the one hand,
individuals can be informed by other aware neighbors in information network, on
the other hand, the susceptible individuals can be self-awareness induced by
the infected neighbors in the contact networks (local information) or mass
media (global information). Through Markov chain approach and numerical
computations, we find that the density of infected individuals and the epidemic
threshold can be affected by the structures of the two networks and the
effective transmission rate of the awareness. However, we prove that though the
introduction of the self-awareness can lower the density of infection, which
cannot increase the epidemic threshold no matter of the local information or
global information. Our finding is remarkably different to many previous
results--local information based behavioral response can alter the epidemic
threshold.

linearly with the black hole mass, with a half light radius of
$R_{1/2}\simeq(24\pm14) r_g$ where $r_g=GM_{BH}/c^2$. This corresponds to a
size of $\log(R_{1/2}/cm)=15.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ or $\sim$ 1 light day for a black

connections between neurons in auditory periphery is comparatively low. This
gives way to an accurate modeling of the connectivity of the neuronal network.
The timing is the all important feature in the peripheral neuronal auditory
pathway. The primary auditory neurons e.g. phase lock to periodic sounds with
important interactions with respect to both the refractory periods of the
neurons and to the time delays caused by traveling times along the basilar
membrane or through a synaptic connection. The mathematical tools provide a
solid basis to build models for peripheral auditory processes. In particular,
we study carefully a large class of refractory neurons, find analytical
formulas for the spiking activity, and prove that refractory neurons respond to
periodic signals by asymptotically periodic output. The methods rely on the
theory of positive operators and give a numerical scheme for finding fixed
points to an integral operator with geometric convergence rate. In addition, we
consider a perfect integrator neuron, mathematically equivalent to randomized
random walk, where the random walk is bounded from below, and solve the first
passage time problem using continuous time Markov chain techniques. In an
accompanying paper we set up the simulation framework as a counterpart to the
present mathematical model. By suitably adjusting the few parameters in the
model it is possible to reproduce the basic patterns of neural activity.

establish an undirected edge in between if and only if they share at least one

respectively, under $P_n = \omega\big(n (\ln n)^5\big)$ (all asymptotic
notation are understood with $n \to \infty$). The analysis reveals that just
like ($k$-)connectivity shown in prior work, for both properties of perfect

exhibits phase transitions: for each property above, as $K_n$ increases, the
limit of the probability that $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ has the property increases from
$0$ to $1$. Second, we compute the phase transition widths of $G(n, K_n, P_n)$

as the difference between the minimal $K_n$ ensuring $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ having

then $d_n(KC, a)$ is either $0$ or $1$ for each $n$ sufficiently large. (ii) If
$P_n=\Theta(n\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)=\Theta(1)$. (iii) If $P_n=\omega(n\ln

$d_n(PMC, a)$ and $d_n(HCC, a)$ are both $\omega(1)$.

suggesting that secondary stellar bars, which are embedded in large-scale
primary bars, are long-lived structures. However, up to now it has been hard to
self-consistently simulate a disc galaxy that sustains two nested stellar bars
for longer than a few rotation periods. N-body/hydrodynamical simulations
including star formation recipes have been performed. Their properties have
been compared with the most recent observational data in order to prove that
they are representative of double-barred galaxies, even SB0. Overlaps in
dynamical resonances and bar modes have been looked for using Fourier
spectrograms. Double-barred galaxies have been successfully simulated with
lifetimes as long as 7 Gyr. The stellar population of the secondary bar is
younger on average than for the primary large-scale bar. An important feature
of these simulations is the absence of any resonance overlap for several Gyr.
In particular, there is no overlap between the primary bar ILR and the
secondary bar corotation. Therefore, mode coupling cannot sustain the secondary
bar mode. Star formation is identified here as possibly being responsible for
bringing energy to the nuclear mode. Star formation is also responsible for
limiting the amount of gas in the central region which prevents the orbits
sustaining the secondary bar from being destroyed. Therefore, the secondary bar
can dissolve but reappear after approx. 1 Gyr. When star formation is switched
off the dynamical perturbation associated with the secondary bar needs several
Gyr to fully vanish. Double-bars can be long-lived in numerical simulations
with a gaseous component, even in the absence of overlap of resonances or mode
coupling, provided that star formation remains active in the central region
where the nuclear bar lies.

color-texture features and a dictionary of visual words, and (3) temporal
verifying. The experimental evaluation and analysis are done for each step. We
believe that it is a useful service to both academic research and real-world

unresolved or slightly resolved radio structures on a scale of 1-3 kpc, with
only one exception of a FRI/FRII source extended over $\sim$40 kpc. We isolate
the radio core component in most of them. The sample splits into two groups.
Four sources have small black hole (BH) masses (mostly $\sim$10$^{7}$
M$_{\odot}$) and are hosted by blue galaxies, often showing evidence of a
contamination from star formation to their radio emission and associated with
radio-quiet AGN. The second group consists in seven radio-loud AGN, which live
in red massive ($\sim10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) early-type galaxies, with large BH
masses ($\gtrsim$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$), and spectroscopically classified as Low
Excitation Galaxies, all characteristics typical of FRI radio galaxies. They
also lie on the correlation between radio core power and [O III] line
luminosity defined by FRIs. However, they are more core dominated (by a factor
of $\sim$30) than FRIs and show a deficit of extended radio emission. We dub
these sources 'FR0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio
emission, the single distinguishing feature with respect to FRIs. The
differences in radio properties between FR0s and FRIs might be ascribed to an
evolutionary effect, with the FR0 sources undergoing to rapid intermittency
that prevents the growth of large scale structures. In our preferred scenario
the lack of extended radio emission in FR0s is due to their smaller jet Lorentz
$\Gamma$ factor with respect to FRIs, causing possible instabilities and their
premature disruption.[abridged]

potentials appropriate to describe a system of hard-sphere colloids and linear
homopolymers in good solvent, and investigate the behavior when the soft
particles are smaller than the colloids, which is the regime of validity of the
coarse-grained models. Using computer-simulation results as a benchmark, we
find that the hypernetted-chain approximation provides accurate estimates of
thermodynamics and structure in the colloid-gas phase in which the density of
colloids is small. On the other hand, all closures considered appear to be
unable to describe the behavior of the mixture in the colloid-liquid phase, as
they cease to converge at polymer densities significantly smaller than those at
the binodal. As a consequence, integral equations appear to be unable to
predict a quantitatively correct phase diagram.

understanding the fundamental physics of quantum thermodynamics and information
physics. We generalize the QSZE to an arbitrary spin case, i.e., a spin QSZE
(SQSZE), and we systematically study the basic physical properties of both
fermion and boson SQSZEs in a low-temperature approximation. We give the
analytic formulation of the total work. For the fermion SQSZE, the work might
be absorbed from the environment, and the change rate of the work with
temperature exhibits periodicity and even-odd oscillation, which is a
generalization of a spinless QSZE. It is interesting that the average absorbed
work oscillates regularly and periodically in a large-number limit, which
implies that the average absorbed work in a fermion SQSZE is neither an
intensive quantity nor an extensive quantity. The phase diagrams of both
fermion and boson SQSZEs give the SQSZE doing positive or negative work in the
parameter space of the temperature and the particle number of the system, but
they have different behaviors because the spin degrees of the fermion and the
boson play different roles in their configuration states and corresponding
statistical properties. The critical temperature of phase transition depends
sensitively on the particle number. By using Landauer's erasure principle, we
give the erasure work in a thermodynamic cycle, and we define an efficiency (we
refer to it as information-work efficiency) to measure the engine's ability of
utilizing information to extract work. We also give the conditions under which
the maximum extracted work and highest information-work efficiencies for
fermion and boson SQSZEs can be achieved.

hydrodynamical simulations with realistic microphysics and grey
radiative-transfer to model a short period Cepheid. The simulations show that
the strength of the convection zone varies significantly over the pulsation
period and exhibits a phase shift relative to the variations in radius. We
evaluate the convective flux and the work integral as predicted by the most
common convection models. It turns out that over one pulsation cycle the model
parameter $\alpha_{\rm c}$, has to be varied by up to a factor of beyond 2 to
match the convective flux obtained from the simulations. To bring convective
fluxes integrated over the He II convection zone and the overshoot zone below
into agreement, this parameter has to be varied by a factor of up to $\sim 7.5$

overshoot zone by radially symmetric and fluctuating quantities. To
successfully model this scenario by a static, one dimensional or even by a

upscattered high-energy photons retain a fraction of the polarization. Current
and future X-ray and gamma-ray polarimeters such as INTEGRAL-SPI, PoGOLITE,
X-Calibur, Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter, GEMS-like missions, ASTRO-H, and
POLARIX have the potential to discover polarized X-rays and gamma-rays from
blazar jets for the first time. Detection of such polarization will open a
qualitatively new window into high-energy blazar emission; actual measurements
of polarization degree and angle will quantitatively test theories of jet
emission mechanisms. We examine the detection prospects of blazars by these
polarimetry missions using examples of 3C 279, PKS 1510-089, and 3C 454.3,
bright sources with relatively high degrees of low-energy polarization. We
conclude that while balloon polarimeters will be challenged to detect blazars
within reasonable observational times (with X-Calibur offering the most
promising prospects), space-based missions should detect the brightest blazars
for polarization fractions down to a few percent. Typical flaring activity of
blazars could boost the overall number of polarimetric detections by nearly a
factor of five to six purely accounting for flux increase of the brightest of
the comprehensive, all-sky, Fermi-LAT blazar distribution. The instantaneous
increase in the number of detections is approximately a factor of two, assuming
a duty cycle of 20% for every source. The detectability of particular blazars
may be reduced if variations in the flux and polarization fraction are
anticorrelated. Simultaneous use of variability and polarization trends could
guide the selection of blazars for high-energy polarimetric observations.

optimum set of parameters for these filters. We developed an emulation of the

which govern the boundaries between stars on the one hand and sharp or extended
events on the other hand. We evaluate the detection and rejection performance
of the algorithm using catalogues of simulated single stars, double stars,
cosmic rays, Solar protons, unresolved galaxies, and asteroids. We optimised
the rejection parameters, improving - with respect to the functional baseline -
the detection performance of single and double stars, while, at the same time,
improving the rejection performance of cosmic rays and of Solar protons. We
find that the minimum separation to resolve a close, equal-brightness double
star is 0.23 arcsec in the along-scan and 0.70 arcsec in the across-scan
direction, independent of the brightness of the primary. We find that, whereas
the optimised rejection parameters have no significant impact on the
detectability of de Vaucouleurs profiles, they do significantly improve the
detection of exponential-disk profiles. We also find that the optimised
rejection parameters provide detection gains for asteroids fainter than 20 mag

comes at the expense of a modest detection-probability loss for bright,
fast-moving near-Earth objects. The major side effect of the optimised
parameters is that spurious ghosts in the wings of bright stars essentially

(Source I). Spectral energy distribution (SED) of each source is determined by
using previous 3 mm continuum emission data. Physical properties such as size,
mass, hydrogen number density and column density are discussed based on the
dust graybody SED. Among 11 identified sources, Source I, a massive protostar
candidate, is a dominant energy source in Orion KL. We extensively investigate
its SED from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. The SED of Source I can
be fitted with a single power-law index of 1.97 suggesting an optically thick
emission. We employ the H$^{-}$ free-free emission as an opacity source of this
optically thick emission. The temperature, density, and mass of the
circumstellar disk associated with Source I are constrained by the SED of
H$^{-}$ free-free emission. Still the fitting result shows a significant
deviation from the observed flux densities. Combined with the thermal dust
graybody SED to explain excess emission at higher frequency, a smaller
power-law index of 1.60 for the H$^{-}$ free-free emission is obtained in the
SED fitting. The power-law index smaller than 2 would suggest a compact source
size or a clumpy structure unresolved with the present study. Future higher
resolution observations with ALMA are essential to reveal more detailed spatial
structure and physical properties of Source I.

Beurling transform. In view of a theorem of Smirnov which states that the
dimension of a $k$-quasicircle is at most $1+k^2$, it is natural to expect that
the maximum asymptotic variance $\Sigma^2 = 1$. In this paper, we prove
$0.87913 \le \Sigma^2 \le 1$.
  For the lower bound, we give examples of polynomial Julia sets which are
$k$-quasicircles with dimensions $1+ 0.87913 \, k^2$ for $k$ small, thereby
showing that $\Sigma^2 \ge 0.87913$. The key ingredient in this construction is
a good estimate for the distortion $k$, which is better than the one given by a
straightforward use of the $\lambda$-lemma in the appropriate parameter space.
Finally, we develop a new fractal approximation scheme for evaluating
$\Sigma^2$ in terms of nearly circular polynomial Julia sets.

been shown to be extremely rich in refractory inclusions, the oldest material
ever found in the Solar System. It exhibits several peculiar features, most
notably its polarimetric behavior. In recent years other objects sharing the
same property (collectively known as ""Barbarians"") have been discovered.
Interferometric observations in the mid-infrared with the ESO VLTI suggested
that (234) Barbara might have a bi-lobated shape or even a large companion
satellite. We use a large set of 57 optical lightcurves acquired between 1979
and 2014, together with the timings of two stellar occultations in 2009, to
determine the rotation period, spin-vector coordinates, and 3-D shape of (234)
Barbara, using two different shape reconstruction algorithms. By using the
lightcurves combined to the results obtained from stellar occultations, we are
able to show that the shape of (234) Barbara exhibits large concave areas.
Possible links of the shape to the polarimetric properties and the object
evolution are discussed. We also show that VLTI data can be modeled without the
presence of a satellite.

platform to produce spin squeezing since photon of cavity mode can induce
nonlinear spin-spin interaction and thus generate a one-axis twisting
Hamiltonian $H_{\text{OAT}}=qJ_{x}^{2}$, whose corresponding maximal squeezing
factor scales as $N^{-2/3}$, where $N$ is the atomic number. On the contrary,
for the other two-axis twisting Hamiltonian
$H_{\text{TAT}}=q(J_{x}^{2}-J_{y}^{2})$, the maximal squeezing factor scales as
$N^{-1}$, approaching the Heisenberg limit. In this paper, inspired by recent
experiments of cavity-assisted Raman transitions, we propose a scheme, in which
an ensemble of ultracold six-level atoms interacts with two quantized cavity
fields and two pairs of Raman lasers, to realize a tunable two-axis spin
Hamiltonian $%H=q(J_{x}^{2}+\chi J_{y}^{2})+\omega_{0}J_{z}$. For proper
parameters, the above one- and two- axis twisting Hamiltonians are recovered,
and the scaling of $N^{-1}$ of the maximal squeezing factor can occur
naturally. On the other hand, in the two-axis twisting Hamiltonian, spin
squeezing is usually reduced when increasing the effective atomic resonant
frequency $\omega_{0}$. Surprisingly, we find that by combined with the
dimensionless parameter $\chi(>-1)$, the effective atomic resonant frequency
$\omega_{0}$ can enhance spin squeezing largely. These results are benefit for
achieving the required spin squeezing in experiments.

topic in statistics and machine learning having widespread applications. An
important line of research in this regard is to shrink the extreme spectrum of
the covariance matrix estimators. A separate line of research in the literature
has considered sparse inverse covariance estimation which in turn gives rise to
graphical models. In practice, however, a sparse covariance or inverse
covariance matrix which is simultaneously well-conditioned and at the same time
computationally tractable is desired. There has been little research at the
confluence of these three topics. In this paper we consider imposing a
condition number constraint to various types of losses used in covariance and
inverse covariance matrix estimation. When the loss function can be decomposed
as a sum of an orthogonally invariant function of the estimate and its inner
product with a function of the sample covariance matrix, we show that a
solution path algorithm can be derived, involving a series of ordinary
differential equations. The path algorithm is attractive because it provides
the entire family of estimates for all possible values of the condition number
bound, at the same computational cost of a single estimate with a fixed upper
bound. An important finding is that the proximal operator for the condition
number constraint, which turns out to be very useful in regularizing loss
functions that are not orthogonally invariant and may yield
non-positive-definite estimates, can be efficiently computed by this path
algorithm. As a concrete illustration of its practical importance, we develop
an operator-splitting algorithm that imposes a guarantee of well-conditioning
as well as positive definiteness to recently proposed convex pseudo-likelihood
based graphical model selection methods.

sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been shown promising
performance in laboratory conditions (i.e. noiseless or random pixel
corrupted), it performs much worse in practical scenarios. In this paper, we
consider the practical face recognition problem, where the occlusions are
predictable and available for sampling. We propose the structured occlusion
coding (SOC) to address occlusion problems. The structured coding here lies in
two folds. On one hand, we employ a structured dictionary for recognition. On
the other hand, we propose to use the structured sparsity in this formulation.
Specifically, SOC simultaneously separates the occlusion and classifies the
image. In this way, the problem of recognizing an occluded image is turned into
seeking a structured sparse solution on occlusion-appended dictionary. In order
to construct a well-performing occlusion dictionary, we propose an occlusion
mask estimating technique via locality constrained dictionary (LCD), showing
striking improvement in occlusion sample. On a category-specific occlusion
dictionary, we replace norm sparsity with the structured sparsity which is
shown more robust, further enhancing the robustness of our approach. Moreover,
SOC achieves significant improvement in handling large occlusion in real world.
Extensive experiments are conducted on public data sets to validate the
superiority of the proposed algorithm.

that cooperation is a learning process, rather than an instinctive impulse or a

mutations and subsequent selection. In this regard, a question arises as to
whether there are any relationships between such phenotypic changes over the
different time scales at which adaptive evolution occurs. In this study, we
analyzed simulated adaptive evolution in a simple cell model, and found that
proportionality between concentration changes in adaptation and evolution over
all components, and the proportion coefficients were closely linked to the
change in the growth rate of a cell. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
phenotypic variances in component concentrations due to (non-genetic) noise and
genomic alternations are proportional across all components. These global

an insight into the shock and pre-shock characteristics, and allow us to

are compared to a grid of models that were obtained from a
magneto-hydrodynamical shock code which calculates the dynamical and chemical
structure of these regions combined with a radiative transfer module based on
the 'large velocity gradient' approximation. The CO emission leads us to update
the conclusions of our previous shock analysis: pre-shock densities of 1e4 cm-3
and shock velocities around 20-25 km s-1 are still constrained, but older ages
are inferred ( 4000 years). We evaluate the contribution of shocks to the
excitation of CO around forming stars. The SiO observations are compatible with
a scenario where less than 4% of the pre-shock SiO belongs to the grain
mantles. We infer outflow parameters: a mass of 1.8x1e-2 Msun was measured in
our beam, in which a momentum of 0.4 Msun km s-1 is dissipated, for an energy
of 4.2x1e43erg. We analyse the energetics of the outflow species by species.
Comparing our results with previous studies highlights their dependence on the

outflows.

the non-compactness of the phase space.
  In this article, we consider a natural definition of hyperbolicity that
requires expanding properties on the preimage of a punctured neighbourhood of
the isolated singularity. We show that this definition is equivalent to another
commonly used one: a {\tef} is hyperbolic if and only if its postsingular set
is a compact subset of the Fatou set. This leads us to propose that this notion

entire functions, and, in particular, that speaking about hyperbolicity makes
sense only within the \emph{Eremenko-Lyubich class} $\mathcal{B}$ of
transcendental entire functions with a bounded set of singular values.
  We also considerably strengthen a recent characterisation of the class
$\mathcal{B}$, by showing that functions outside of this class cannot be
expanding with respect to a metric whose density decays at most polynomially.
In particular, this implies that no transcendental entire function can be
expanding with respect to the spherical metric. Finally we give a

between observations pose critical challenges to visual localization. We
address these challenges using a two-step approach. We first estimate a
candidate pose using few correspondences between features of the current camera
frame and the feature map. The initial set of correspondences is established by
proximity in feature space. The initial pose estimate is used in the second
step to guide spatial matching of features in 3D, i.e., searching for
associations where the image features are expected to be found in the map. A
RANSAC algorithm is used to compute a fine estimation of the pose from the
correspondences. Our approach clearly outperforms localization based on feature
matching exclusively in feature space, both in terms of estimation accuracy and
robustness to failure and allows for global localization in real time (30Hz).

recognizing human actions from still images. Its main challenges lie in the
large variations in human poses and appearances, as well as the lack of

an expressive deep model to naturally integrate human layout and surrounding

particular, a Deep Belief Net is trained to fuse information from different
noisy sources such as body part detection and object detection. To bridge the

Lorentz force acting on a unit positive charge leads immediately to a general
law for electromagnetic induction phenomena. The general law is applied to
three significant cases: moving bar, Faraday's and Corbino's disc. This last
application illustrates the contribution of the drift velocity of the charges
to the induced $emf$: the magneto-resistance effect is obtained without using
microscopic models of electrical conduction. Maxwell wrote down `general
equations of electromotive intensity' that, integrated over a closed loop,
yield the general law for electromagnetic induction, if the velocity appearing
in them is correctly interpreted. The flux of the magnetic field through an
arbitrary surface that have the circuit as contour {\em is not the cause} of
the induced $emf$. The flux rule must be considered as a calculation shortcut
for predicting the value of the induced $emf$ when the circuit is filiform.
Finally, the general law of electromagnetic induction yields the induced $emf$
in both reference frames of a system composed by a magnet and a circuit in
relative uniform motion, as required by special relativity.

and carbon oxides - occur at various optical depths. This implies that
selective desorption mechanisms are at work. An astrochemical model of a
contracting low-mass molecular cloud core is presented. Ice was treated as
consisting of the surface and three subsurface layers (sublayers).
Photodesorption, reactive desorption, and indirect reactive desorption were
investigated. The latter manifests itself through desorption from H+H reaction
on grains. Desorption of shallow subsurface species was included. Modeling
results suggest the existence of a ""photon-dominated ice"" during the early
phases of core contraction. Subsurface ice is chemically processed by
interstellar photons, which produces complex organic molecules. Desorption from
the subsurface layer results in high COM gas-phase abundances at Av =
2.4...10mag. This may contribute towards an explanation for COM observations in
dark cores. It was found that photodesorption mostly governs the onset of ice
accumulation onto grains. Reaction-specific reactive desorption is efficient
for small molecules that form via highly exothermic atom-addition reactions.
Higher reactive desorption efficiency results in lower gas-phase abundances of
COMs. Indirect reactive desorption allows to closely reproduce the observed
H2O:CO:CO2 ratio towards a number of background stars. Presumably this can be
done by any mechanism whose efficiency fits with the sequence CO > CO2 >> H2O.
After the freeze-out has ended, the three sublayers represent chemically
distinct parts of the mantle. 8...10.5mag is the likely AV threshold for the
appearance of CO ice. The lower value is supported by observations.

analysis---and consequently their conclusions---were wrong. Specifically, their
error resulted from an assumption that their data's underlying distribution was
Gaussian. But, as demonstrated in this work, their data closely follow an
ergodic chaotic distribution biased towards extreme values. From a probability

in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ sector. A real singlet scalar can be accidental DM with an
accidental $Z_2$, by virtue of both extended symmetries. A $U(1)_{B-L}$ charged
complex scalar can also be a viable accidental DM due to an accidental (or
remanent) $Z_3$. They can reproduce correct relic density via the annihilations
through the conventional Higgs portal or dark Higgs portal. The dark Higgs
portal scenario is in tension with the LHC bound on $Z_{B-L}$, and only heavy
DM of a few TeVs can have correct relic density. In particular, DM may trigger
spontaneous breaking of scale Invariance (SISB). The situation is relaxed
significantly in the $Z_3$ case due to the effective semi-annihilation mode and
then light DM can be accommodated easily. In addition, the $Z_3$ model can
accommodate the GeV scale $\gamma-$ray excess from the galactic center (GC) via
semi-annihilation into pseudo Goldstone boson (PGSB). The best fit is achieved
at a DM about 52 GeV, with annihilation cross section consistent with the
thermal relic density. The invisible Higgs branching ratio is negligible
because the Higgs portal quartic coupling is very small $\lambda_{h\phi}
\lesssim 10^{-3}$.

lowest-metallicity galaxy considered our best local analog of systems forming
at high-z. Here we report the spatially resolved spectral map of the nebular
HeII4686 emission in IZw18, from which we derived for the first time its total
HeII-ionizing flux. Nebular HeII emission implies the existence of a hard
radiation field. HeII-emitters are observed to be more frequent among high-z
galaxies than for local objects. So investigating the HeII-ionizing source(s)
in IZw18 may reveal the ionization processes at high-z. HeII emission in
star-forming galaxies, has been suggested to be mainly associated with
Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), but WRs cannot satisfactorily explain the
HeII-ionization at all times, in particular at lowest metallicities. Shocks
from supernova remnants, or X-ray binaries, have been proposed as additional
potential sources of HeII-ionizing photons. Our data indicate that conventional
HeII-ionizing sources (WRs, shocks, X-ray binaries) are not sufficient to
explain the observed nebular HeII4686 emission in IZw18. We find that the
HeII-ionizing radiation expected from models for either low-metallicity
super-massive O stars or rotating metal-free stars could account for the
HeII-ionization budget measured, while only the latter models could explain the
highest values of HeII4686/Hbeta observed. The presence of such peculiar stars
in IZw18 is suggestive and further investigation in this regard is needed. This
letter highlights that some of the clues of the early Universe can be found
here in our cosmic backyard.

a generalization of the Iwahori-Matsumoto formula, and as a consequence, we
prove that the structure coefficients of the double coset basis are polynomials
in the order of the residue field. The basis is naturally indexed by a
semi-group $\mathcal{W}_\mathcal{T}$ on which Braverman, Kazhdan, and Patnaik
define a preorder. Their preorder is a natural generalization of the Bruhat
order on affine Weyl groups, and they conjecture that the preorder is a partial
order. We define another order on $\mathcal{W}_\mathcal{T}$ which is graded by
a length function and is manifestly a partial order. We prove the two
definitions coincide, which implies a positive answer to their conjecture.
Interestingly, the length function seems to naturally take values in

marker of quality of health care in the United States. For the most part,
readmission has been used to study quality of care for patients with acute
health conditions, such as pneumonia and heart failure, with analyses typically
based on a logistic-Normal generalized linear mixed model. Applying this model
to the study readmission among patients with increasingly prevalent advanced
health conditions such as pancreatic cancer is problematic, however, because it
ignores death as a competing risk. A more appropriate analysis is to imbed such
studies within the semi-competing risks framework. To our knowledge, however,
no comprehensive statistical methods have been developed for cluster-correlated
semi-competing risks data. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical
modeling framework for the analysis of cluster-correlated semi-competing risks
data. The framework permits parametric or non-parametric specifications for a
range of model components, including baseline hazard functions and
distributions for key random effects, giving analysts substantial flexibility
as they consider their own analyses. Estimation and inference is performed
within the Bayesian paradigm since it facilitates the straightforward
characterization of (posterior) uncertainty for all model parameters including
hospital-specific random effects. The proposed framework is used to study the
risk of readmission among 5,298 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer at 112 hospitals in the six New England states between
2000-2009, specifically to investigate the role of patient-level risk factors
and to characterize variation in risk across hospitals that is not explained by
differences in patient case-mix.

technology beyond 14nm logic node. To overcome its throughput limitation,
industry has proposed character projection (CP) technique, where some complex
shapes (characters) can be printed in one shot. Recently the traditional EBL
system is extended into multi-column cell (MCC) system to further improve the
throughput. In MCC system, several independent CPs are used to further speed-up

needs to be packed/planned carefully to take advantage of the characters. In
this paper, we prove that the overlapping aware stencil planning (OSP) problem
is NP-hard. To solve OSP problem in MCC system, we present a tool, E-BLOW, with
several novel speedup techniques, such as successive relaxation, dynamic

Burgers equation is utilized to investigate the effect of spatial discreteness
of energy release on the propagation of a detonation wave. While the
traditional Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) treatment of a detonation wave assumes that
the energy release of the medium is homogeneous through space, the system
examined here consists of sources represented by $\delta$-functions embedded in
an otherwise inert medium. The sources are triggered by the passage of the
leading shock wave following a delay that is either of fixed period or randomly
generated. The solution for wave propagation through a large array
($10^3$-$10^4$) of sources in one dimension can be constructed without the use
of a finite difference approximation by tracking the interaction of
sawtooth-profiled waves for which an analytic solution is available. A
detonation-like wave results from the interaction of the shock and rarefaction
waves generated by the sources. The measurement of the average velocity of the
leading shock front for systems of both regular, fixed-period and randomized
sources is found to be in close agreement with the velocity of the equivalent
CJ detonation in a uniform medium wherein the sources have been spatially
homogenized. This result may have implications for the applicability of the CJ
criterion to detonations in highly heterogeneous media (e.g., polycrystalline,
solid explosives) and unstable detonations with a transient and
multidimensional structure (e.g., gaseous detonation waves).
