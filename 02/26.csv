can produce measurable seismoelectric signals due to wave-induced fluid flow
between regions of differing compressibility. The dependence of these signals
on the petrophysical and structural characteristics of the probed rock mass
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we derive an analytical solution to
describe the seismoelectric response of a rock sample, containing a horizontal
layer at its center, that is subjected to an oscillatory compressibility test.
We then adapt this general solution to compute the seismoelectric signature of
a particular case related to a sample that is permeated by a horizontal
fracture located at its center. Analyses of the general and particular
solutions are performed to study the impact of different petrophysical and
structural parameters on the seismoelectric response. We find that the
amplitude of the seismoelectric signal is directly proportional to the applied
stress, to the Skempton coefficient contrast between the host rock and the
layer, and to a weighted average of the effective excess charge of the two
materials. Our results also demonstrate that the frequency at which the maximum
electrical potential amplitude prevails does not depend on the applied stress
or the Skempton coefficient contrast. In presence of strong permeability
variations, this frequency is rather controlled by the permeability and
thickness of the less permeable material. The results of this study thus
indicate that seismoelectric measurements can potentially be used to estimate
key mechanical and hydraulic rock properties of mesoscopic heterogeneities,
such as compressibility, permeability, and fracture compliance.

$\gamma$-ray flares, while optical-UV fluxes show little variations. During the
GeV outburst, the highest $\gamma$-ray flux measured is (5.22 $\pm$ 1.10)
$\times$ 10$^{-6}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the range of 0.1-300 GeV, which
corresponds to an isotropic $\gamma$-ray luminosity of (1.62 $\pm$ 0.44)
$\times$ 10$^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$, thereby making this as one of the most
luminous $\gamma$-ray flare ever observed from any blazar. A fast $\gamma$-ray
flux rising time of $\sim$3 hours is also noticed which is probably the first
measurement of hour scale variability detected from a high redshift (z > 2)
blazar. The various activity states of S5 0836+71 are reproduced under the
assumption of single zone leptonic emission model. In all the states, the
emission region is located inside the broad line region, and the optical-UV
radiation is dominated by the accretion disk emission. The modeling parameters
suggests the enhancement in bulk Lorentz factor as a primary cause of the
$\gamma$-ray flare. The high X-ray activity with less variable $\gamma$-ray
counterpart can be due to emission region to be located relatively closer to
the black hole where the dominating energy density of the disk emission results
in higher X-ray flux due to inverse-Compton scattering of disk photons.

refer to as the Online Pairwise lEaRning Algorithm (OPERA). In contrast to
existing works \cite{Kar,Wang} which require that the iterates are restricted

associated with a non-strongly convex objective function and learns the target

which guarantees the almost surely convergence for the last iterate of OPERA
without any assumptions on the underlying distribution. Explicit convergence
rates are derived under the condition of polynomially decaying step sizes. We
also establish an interesting property for a family of widely-used kernels in
the setting of pairwise learning and illustrate the above convergence results
using such kernels. Our methodology mainly depends on the characterization of
RKHSs using its associated integral operators and probability inequalities for

opinion formation in which agents may either have a strict preference for a
choice, or be undecided. The opinion shift emerges during interpersonal
communications, as a consequence of a cumulative process of conviction for one
of the two extremes opinions through repeated interactions. There are two main
ingredients which play key roles in determining the steady state: the initial
fraction of undecided agents and the conviction's sensitivity in each
interaction. As a function of these two parameters, the model presents a wide
range of possible solutions, as for instance, consensus of each opinion,
bi-polarisation or convergence of undecided individuals. We found that a
minimum fraction of undecided agents is crucial not only for reaching consensus
of a given opinion, but also to determine a dominant opinion in a polarised
situation. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the dynamics, we also
present the theoretical master equations of the model.

appear on the roads in the near future. AVs become connected with the support
of various vehicular communication technologies and they possess high degree of
control to respond to instantaneous situations cooperatively with high
efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a new public
transportation system based on AVs. It manages a fleet of AVs to accommodate
transportation requests, offering point-to-point services with ride sharing. We
focus on the two major problems of the system: scheduling and admission
control. The former is to configure the most economical schedules and routes
for the AVs to satisfy the admissible requests while the latter is to determine
the set of admissible requests among all requests to produce maximum profit.
The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and the
admission control problem is cast as a bilevel optimization, which embeds the
scheduling problem as the major constraint. By utilizing the analytical
properties of the problem, we develop an effective genetic-algorithm-based
method to tackle the admission control problem. We validate the performance of
the algorithm with real-world transportation service data.

light in surface-brightness and colour profiles at large radii in the form of
diffuse faint haloes and thick discs. In a majority of the cases, it has seemed
necessary to use exotic stellar populations or alternative physical solutions
to explain the excess. Few studies have carefully scrutinized the role of
scattered light in this context. I explore the influence of scattered light on
ground-based observations of haloes and thick discs around edge-on galaxies,
haloes around face-on disc galaxies, host galaxies around blue compact galaxies
(BCGs), and haloes around elliptical galaxies. Surface-brightness structures of
all considered types of galaxies are modelled and analysed to compare
scattered-light haloes and thick discs with measurements. I simulate the
influence of scattered light and accurate sky subtraction on simplified
S\'ersic-type and face-on disc galaxy models. All galaxy models are convolved
with both lower-limit and brighter point spread functions (PSFs); for a few
galaxies it was possible to use dedicated PSFs. The results show bright
scattered-light haloes and high amounts of red excess at large radii and faint
surface brightnesses for nearly all types of galaxies; exceptions are the
largest elliptical-type galaxies where the influence of scattered light is
smaller. Studies have underestimated the role of scattered light to explain
their surface-brightness profiles. My analysis shows surface-brightness
profiles that include scattered light that are very similar to and overlap
measurements at all radii. The derivation of physical properties of haloes,
thick discs, and BCG hosts from diffuse data is misleading since accurate and
radially extended PSFs are non-existent. Significantly improved analyses that
include new measurements of PSFs are required to study diffuse haloes further.

barriers determined by the genetic states of the virus and host as a function
of immune response and system temperature. We find a phase transition between a
positive temperature regime of normal replication and a negative temperature
'disordered' phase of the virus. These phases define different regimes in which
different genetic strategies are favored. Perhaps most importantly, it
demonstrates that the system has a real thermodynamic temperature. For normal
replication, this temperature is linearly related to effective temperature. The
strength of immune response rescales temperature but does not change the
observed linear relationship. For all temperatures and immunities studied, we
find a universal curve relating the order parameter to viral evolvability. Real
viruses have finite length RNA segments that encode for proteins which
determine their fitness; hence the methods put forth here could be refined to
apply to real biological systems, perhaps providing insight into immune escape,
the emergence of novel pathogens and other results of viral evolution.

  implications of the work. Note the reference to Markov models",,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The law of mass action is used widely. The law of mass action does not
automatically conserve current, as is clear from mathematics of a simple case,
chosen to illustrate the issues. The law of mass action does not force a series
of chemical reactions to have the same current flow everywhere. Interruption of
far-away current does not stop current everywhere in a series of chemical
reactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and
equation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The
additional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the
chemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that
case, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of
charge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods
that enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved. Variational methods
have only recently been developed to ensure that charge flow is conserved
globally, along with mass, in dissipative systems like ions in solution or
proteins. The Energy Variational Approach EnVarA should allow the development
of more robust models of chemical, biochemical, and biological systems, making
practical devices more easy to design and build. These difficulties arise away
from equilibrium, when current flows, and the law of mass action is applied to
a non-equilibrium situation, different from the systems considered when the law
was originally derived. Non-equilibrium systems are important. Almost all of
biology occurs away from equilibrium. Almost all devices of our technology
function away from equilibrium. I believe robust models and device designs in
the chemical world will not be possible until continuity of current is embedded
in a generalization of the law of mass action using a consistent variational
model of energy and dissipation.

the inputs to be carefully specified. Some of these inputs called control
variables have to reproduce physical conditions whereas other inputs, called
parameters, are specific to the computer code and most often uncertain. The
goal of statistical calibration consists in estimating these parameters with
the help of a statistical model which links the code outputs with the field
measurements. In a Bayesian setting, the posterior distribution of these
parameters is normally sampled using MCMC methods. However, they are
impractical when the code runs are high time-consuming. A way to circumvent
this issue consists of replacing the computer code with a Gaussian process
emulator, then sampling a cheap-to-evaluate posterior distribution based on it.
Doing so, calibration is subject to an error which strongly depends on the
numerical design of experiments used to fit the emulator. We aim at reducing
this error by building a proper sequential design by means of the Expected
Improvement criterion. Numerical illustrations in several dimensions assess the
efficiency of such sequential strategies.

characterize the languages for which short advice can be removed by the notion

to remove short advice of probabilistic computation. We indicate that existence

designed so that they retain robustness with respect to initialization, as long

Several models of different complexity have been developed in order to mimic

Pickett's tunneling barrier model describes the TiO2 memristors, and utilizes
complex derivative of tunnel barrier width. It attains a large error in the ON
switching region. Variety of research consider it as the reference model for
the TiO2 memristors. In this paper, we first analyze the theory of operation of
the memristor and discuss Pickett's model. Then, we propose a modification to
its derivative functions to provide a lower error and closer agreement with
physical behavior. This modification is represented by two additional fitting
parameters to damp or accelerate the tunnel width derivative. Also, we
incorporate a hard limiter term to limit the tunnel width to its physical
extremes 1 nm and 2 nm. We run simulations to test the model modifications and
we compare the results to the experimental and original Pickett's model
results. The modified model more closely resembles the experimental behavior of
TiO2 memristors and potentially enables the memristor to be used as a
multilevel memory.

Eikonal equation arising from a variety of scientific and engineering fields.
It is long deemed inherently sequential and an efficient parallel algorithm
applicable to large-scale practical applications is not available in the
literature. In this study, we present a highly scalable massively parallel
implementation of the fast marching method using a domain decomposition
approach. Central to this algorithm is a novel restarted narrow band approach
that coordinates the frequency of communications and the amount of computations
extra to a sequential run for achieving an unprecedented parallel performance.
Within each restart, the narrow band fast marching method is executed; simple
synchronous local exchanges and global reductions are adopted for communicating
updated data in the overlapping regions between neighboring subdomains and
getting the latest front status, respectively. The independence of front
characteristics is exploited through special data structures and augmented
status tags to extract the masked parallelism within the fast marching method.
The efficiency, flexibility, and applicability of the parallel algorithm are
demonstrated through several examples. These problems are extensively tested on
six grids with up to 1 billion points using different numbers of processes
ranging from 1 to 65536. Remarkable parallel speedups are achieved using tens
of thousands of processes. Detailed pseudo-codes for both the sequential and
parallel algorithms are provided to illustrate the simplicity of the parallel
implementation and its similarity to the sequential narrow band fast marching
algorithm.

powerful relations between low-energy observables and the underlying

principles, such as causality and unitarity. In this paper, we seek similar
connections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics
responsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationary
theory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativistic
interactions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusing
on forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination of
low-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energy
behavior of the theory. While for relativistic amplitudes unitarity is
sufficient to prove positivity of the sum rule, this is not guaranteed in the
non-relativistic case. We discuss the conditions under which positivity still
applies, and show that they are satisfied by all known UV completions of
single-field inflation. In that case, we obtain a consistency condition for
primordial non-Gaussianity, which constrains the size and the sign of the
equilateral four-point function in terms of the amplitude of the three-point
function. The resulting bound rules out about half of the parameter space that
is still allowed by current observations. Finding a violation of our
consistency condition would point towards less conventional theories of
inflation, or violations of basic physical principles.

$\delta_{imp}$, different electron doping concentrations $\delta$ are
investigated for given SPs. Samples are found to be very robust against weak
SP, in which order parameters do not have qualitative change even at very large

parameters. For moderate SP, variations of order parameters on and around
impurities strongly depend on $\delta$, however the distribution functions of

harmonic-generation efficiencies are 2.6*10-9, 8*10-9 and 1.3*10-8 for

Velocimetry. The experiments are supplemented by shallow water numerical
simulations as well as a linear theory which describes the Rossby wave
radiation by travelling vortices. The cyclonic vortices observed in the
experiments travel to the northwest and continuously radiate Rossby waves.
Measurements show that initially axisymmetric vortices develop a dipolar
component which enables them to perform translational motion. A pattern of
alternating zonal jets to the west of the vortex is created by Rossby waves
with approximately zonal crests. Energy spectra of the flows in the wavenumber
space indicate that a wavenumber similar to that introduced by Rhines for
turbulent flows on the beta-plane can be introduced here. The wavenumber is
based on the translational speed of a vortex rather than on the
root-mean-square velocity of a turbulent flow. The comparison between the
experiments and numerical simulations demonstrates that evolving vortices also
emit inertial waves. While these essentially three-dimensional waves can be
observed in the altimetric data they are not accounted for in the shallow water
simulations.

  of this work (without proofs) has appeared in FOCS 2015",,,,"cs.CC cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An instance of the Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP) is given by
a finite set of variables, a finite domain of labels, and a sum of functions,
each function depending on a subset of the variables. Each function can take
finite values specifying costs of assignments of labels to its variables or the
infinite value, which indicates infeasible assignments. The goal is to find an
assignment of labels to the variables that minimizes the sum.
  We study (assuming that P $\ne$ NP) how the complexity of this very general
problem depends on the set of functions allowed in the instances, the so-called
constraint language. The case when all allowed functions take values in
$\{0,\infty\}$ corresponds to ordinary CSPs, where one deals only with the
feasibility issue and there is no optimization. This case is the subject of the
Algebraic CSP Dichotomy Conjecture predicting for which constraint languages
CSPs are tractable and for which NP-hard. The case when all allowed functions
take only finite values corresponds to finite-valued CSP, where the feasibility
aspect is trivial and one deals only with the optimization issue. The
complexity of finite-valued CSPs was fully classified by Thapper and
\v{Z}ivn\'y.
  An algebraic necessary condition for tractability of a general-valued CSP
with a fixed constraint language was recently given by Kozik and Ochremiak. As
our main result, we prove that if a constraint language satisfies this
algebraic necessary condition, and the feasibility CSP corresponding to the
VCSP with this language is tractable, then the VCSP is tractable. The algorithm
is a simple combination of the assumed algorithm for the feasibility CSP and
the standard LP relaxation. As a corollary, we obtain that a dichotomy for
ordinary CSPs would imply a dichotomy for general-valued CSPs.

space with codimension two admitting genuine isometric deformations, until now
the only known examples with the maximal possible rank four are the real
Kaehler minimal submanifolds classified by Dajczer-Gromoll \cite{dg3} in
parametric form. These submanifolds behave like minimal surfaces, namely, if
simple connected either they admit a nontrivial one-parameter associated family
of isometric deformations or are holomorphic.
  In this paper, we characterize a new class of complete minimal genuinely
deformable Euclidean submanifolds of rank four but now the structure of their
second fundamental and the way it gets modified while deforming is quite more
involved than in the Kaehler case. This can be seen as a strong indication that
the above classification problem is quite challenging. Being minimal, the
submanifolds we introduced are also interesting by themselves. In particular,
because associated to any complete holomorphic curve in $\C^N$ there is such a
submanifold and, beside, the manifold in general is not Kaehler.

be insensitive to high energy scales due to the existence of an approximate
infrared fixed point. The appearance of vector resonances is described and the
correspondence with other proposals in the literature established. The model
described here is significantly simpler than other recent ultraviolet

cluster M68 (NGC 4590), using these to detect variable objects. We also
obtained electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) observations for this cluster in
order to explore its core with unprecedented spatial resolution from the
ground.
  We reduced our data using difference image analysis, in order to achieve the
best possible photometry in the crowded field of the cluster. In doing so, we
showed that when dealing with identical networked telescopes, a reference image
from any telescope may be used to reduce data from any other telescope, which
facilitates the analysis significantly. We then used our light curves to
estimate the properties of the RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in M68 through Fourier
decomposition and empirical relations. The variable star properties then
allowed us to derive the cluster's metallicity and distance.
  We determine new periods for the variable stars, and search for new
variables, especially in the core of the cluster where our method performs
particularly well. We detect an additional 4 SX Phe stars, and confirm the
variability of another star, bringing the total number of confirmed variable
stars in this cluster to 50. We also used archival data stretching back to 1951
in order to derive period changes for some of the single-mode RRL stars, and
analyse the significant number of double-mode RRL stars in M68. Furthermore, we
find evidence for double-mode pulsation in one of the SX Phe stars in this
cluster. Using the different types of variables, we derived an estimate of the
metallicity, [Fe/H]=$-2.07 \pm 0.06$ on the ZW scale, and 4 independent
estimates of the distance modulus ($\mu_0 \sim$ 15.00 mag) for this cluster.
Thanks to the first use of difference image analysis on time-series

a factor of ~1.5 to 12), with abundance matching and richness methods providing
the best results, irrespective of the input model assumptions. In addition,
certain methods produce a significant number of catastrophic cases where the

falling high-mass end of the cluster mass function, we recommend that richness

comparison with the group/cluster mass, however, this does not guarantee that
the correct member galaxies are being selected. We do not observe significantly
higher scatter for either mock galaxy catalogues. Our results have implications

quasiparticle excitations. The model consists of an array of
strongly-interacting one-dimensional systems, where the one-dimensional systems
are coupled to each other by local interactions and tunneling of the electrons
and Cooper pairs between them. Within the interchain mean-field theory, we find
several SC states from the model, including a conventional uniform SC state,
PDW SC state, and a coexisting phase of the uniform SC and PDW states. In this
quasi-1D regime we can treat the strong correlation physics essentially exactly
using bosonization methods and the crossover to the 2D system by means of
interchain mean field theory. The resulting critical temperatures of the SC
phases generically exhibit a power-law scaling with the coupling constants of
the array, instead of the essential singularity found in weak-coupling BCS-type
theories. Electronic excitations with an open Fermi surface, which emerge from
the electronic Luttinger liquid systems below their crossover temperature to
the Fermi liquid, are then coupled to the SC order parameters via the proximity
effect. From the Fermi surface thus coupled to the SC order parameters, we
calculate the quasiparticle spectrum in detail. We show that the quasiparticle
spectrum can be fully gapped or nodal in the uniform SC phase and also in the
coexisting phase of the uniform SC and PDW parameters. In the pure PDW state,
the excitation spectrum has a reconstructed Fermi surface in the form of Fermi
pockets of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

heavy New Physics in the context of an Effective Field Theory (EFT). These

EFT may be compromised. In this paper we propose to address this issue by
comparing with benchmark models. The connection between models and their
manifestations as EFTs at low energies allows us to quantify the breakdown of
the EFT, and describe ways to combine different sources of constraints beyond
Higgs physics. To illustrate these techniques, in this paper we propose a set
of benchmark models based on extensions of the Higgs sector, namely the
inclusion of a singlet, a dilaton and generic 2HDMs. We obtain the matching
between these models and the EFT involving the Higgs, electroweak bosons and
fermions. We then describe current and future indirect and direct constraints,
consider the effect of correlations among the coefficients within models, and
discuss the validity of the EFT.

torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is at present best understood through the
fraction of sources exhibiting Compton-thick absorption along the line of sight
($N_{H}>1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the X-ray band, which reveals the
average covering factor. Determining this Compton-thick fraction is difficult
however, due to the extreme obscuration. With its spectral coverage at hard
X-rays ($>$10 keV), NuSTAR is sensitive to the AGN covering factor since
Compton scattering of X-rays off optically thick material dominates at these
energies. We present a spectral analysis of 10 AGN observed with NuSTAR where
the obscuring medium is optically thick to Compton scattering, so called
Compton-thick (CT) AGN. We use the torus models of Brightman & Nandra which
predict the X-ray spectrum from reprocessing in a torus and include the torus
opening angle as a free parameter and aim to determine the covering factor of
the Compton-thick gas in these sources individually. Across the sample we find
mild to heavy Compton-thick columns, with $N_{H}$ measured from
$10^{24}-10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a wide range of covering factors, where
individual measurements range from 0.2-0.9. We find that the covering factor,
$f_{c}$, is a strongly decreasing function of the intrinsic 2-10 keV
luminosity, $L_{X}$, where $f_{c}=(-0.41\pm0.13)$log$_{10}$($L_{X}$/erg
s$^{-1}$)$+18.31\pm5.33$, across more than two orders of magnitude in $L_{X}$
(10$^{41.5}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The covering factors measured here agree
well with the obscured fraction as a function of $L_{X}$ as determined by
studies of local AGN with $L_{X}>10^{42.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

symmetric, yet spherical symmetry is a helpful simplifying approximation for
idealised calculations and analysis of observational data. The assumption leads
to an exact conservation of angular momentum for every particle, making the
dynamics unrealistic. But how much does that inaccuracy matter in practice for
analyses of stellar distribution functions, collisionless relaxation, or dark
matter core-creation?
  We provide a general answer to this question for a wide class of aspherical
systems; specifically, we consider distribution functions that are ""maximally
stable"", i.e. that do not evolve at first order when external potentials (which
arise from baryons, large scale tidal fields or infalling substructure) are
applied. We show that a spherically-symmetric analysis of such systems gives
rise to the false conclusion that the density of particles in phase space is
ergodic (a function of energy alone).
  Using this idea we are able to demonstrate that: (a) observational analyses
that falsely assume spherical symmetry are made more accurate by imposing a
strong prior preference for near-isotropic velocity dispersions in the centre
of spheroids; (b) numerical simulations that use an idealised
spherically-symmetric setup can yield misleading results and should be avoided
where possible; and (c) triaxial dark matter halos (formed in collisionless
cosmological simulations) nearly attain our maximally-stable limit, but their
evolution freezes out before reaching it.

We use the \textit{Magneticum} simulations, which are well suited because of
their accurate treatment of baryons, high resolution, and large cosmological
volumes of up to $(3818~\textrm{Mpc})^3$. Baryonic effects globally decrease
the masses of galaxy clusters, which, at a given mass, results in a decrease of
their number density. This effect vanishes at high redshift $z\sim2$ and for
high masses $M_{200\textrm m}\gtrsim10^{14}M\odot$. We perform cosmological
analyses of three idealized approximations to the cluster surveys by the South
Pole Telescope (SPT), \textit{Planck}, and eROSITA. We pursue two main
questions: (1) What is the impact of baryons? -- For the SPT-like and the
\textit{Planck}-like samples, the impact of baryons on cosmological results is
negligible. In the eROSITA-like case, however, neglecting the baryonic impact
leads to an underestimate of $\Omega_\textrm m$ by about $0.01$, which is
comparable to the expected uncertainty from eROSITA. (2) How does our DMonly
HMF compare with previous work? -- For the \textit{Planck}-like sample, results
obtained using our DMonly HMF are shifted by
$\Delta(\sigma_8)\simeq\Delta(\sigma_8(\Omega_\textrm m/0.27)^{0.3})\simeq0.02$
with respect to results obtained using the Tinker et al. (2008) fit. This
suggests that using our HMF would shift results from \textit{Planck} clusters
toward better agreement with CMB anisotropy measurements. Finally, we discuss
biases that can be introduced through inadequate HMF parametrizations that
introduce false cosmological sensitivity.

Wendland kernel functions, a particle wake-up time-step limiting mechanism and
a time-dependent scheme for artificial viscosity, which includes a high-order
gradient computation and shear flow limiter. Additionally, we include a novel
prescription for time-dependent artificial conduction, which corrects for
gravitationally induced pressure gradients and largely improves the SPH
performance in capturing the development of gas-dynamical instabilities. We
extensively test our new implementation in a wide range of hydrodynamical
standard tests including weak and strong shocks as well as shear flows,
turbulent spectra, gas mixing, hydrostatic equilibria and self-gravitating gas
clouds. We jointly employ all modifications; however, when necessary we study
the performance of individual code modules. We approximate hydrodynamical
states more accurately and with significantly less noise than standard SPH.
Furthermore, the new implementation promotes the mixing of entropy between
different fluid phases, also within cosmological simulations. Finally, we study
the performance of the hydrodynamical solver in the context of radiative galaxy
formation and non-radiative galaxy cluster formation. We find galactic disks to
be colder, thinner and more extended and our results on galaxy clusters show
entropy cores instead of steadily declining entropy profiles. In summary, we
demonstrate that our improved SPH implementation overcomes most of the
undesirable limitations of standard SPH, thus becoming the core of an efficient
code for large cosmological simulations.

below the `knee', and an enhancement above it. This results in a bias, whereby
the `knee' mass is increased and the faint end slope is steepened. For ALFALFA
and HIPASS we find that the maximum impact this bias can have on the Schechter
fit parameters is similar in magnitude to the published random errors. On the
other hand, the impact of confusion on the HI mass functions of upcoming medium
depth interferometric surveys, will be below the level of the random errors. In
addition, we find that previous estimates of the number of detections for
upcoming surveys with SKA-precursor telescopes may have been too optimistic, as
the framework implemented here results in number counts between 60% and 75% of
those previously predicted, while accurately reproducing the counts of existing
surveys. Finally, we argue that any future single dish, wide area surveys of HI
galaxies would be best suited to focus on deep observations of the local
Universe (z < 0.05), as confusion may prevent them from being competitive with
interferometric surveys at higher redshift, while their lower angular
resolution allows their completeness to be more easily calibrated for nearby
extended sources.

intensity profile perpendicular to the scan direction. Spherically symmetric
radiative transfer models with a power law density distribution were used to
study the circumstellar matter distribution. Single dish sub-mm data were also
included to study how different spatial information affects the fitted density
distribution. The density distribution which best fits both the 70$\mu$m

in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron sized dust grains must
grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an
evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet photons, while
dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and
resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in
turn, selectively carry small dust grains leaving the larger particles---which
decouple from the gas---behind in the disk. We study these effects by
investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by
EUV, FUV and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a 1-D multi-fluid
approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface
density distributions. The 1-D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models
constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and
determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust
coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk
lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is
thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find
that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass
ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result
in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen.
We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet
formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants. After gas disk
dispersal, $\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ \ms\ of mass in solids typically remain,

propose a methodology to model and analyze spreading processes with arbitrary
transmission times using phase-type distributions. Phase-type distributions are
a family of distributions that is dense in the set of positive-valued
distributions and can be used to approximate any given distributions. To
illustrate our methodology, we focus on a popular model of spreading over
networks: the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networked model. In the
standard version of this model, individuals informed about a piece of
information transmit this piece to its neighbors at an exponential rate. In
this paper, we extend this model to the case of transmission rates following a
phase-type distribution. Using this extended model, we analyze the dynamics of
the spread based on a vectorial representations of phase-type distributions. We
illustrate our results by analyzing spreading processes over networks with
transmission and recovery rates following a Weibull distribution.

holes immersed in a distorting background magnetic field and unlike the
standard Kerr-Newman (KN) family they are not asymptotically flat. As exact
solutions with horizons that can be highly distorted relative to KN, they
provide a good testbed for ideas about and theorems constraining black hole
horizons.
  We explicitly show that MKN horizons with fixed magnetic field parameter may
be uniquely specified by their area, charge and angular momentum and that the
charge and angular momentum are bound by horizon area in the same way as for
KN. As expected, extremal MKN horizons are geometrically isomorphic to extremal
KN horizons and the geometric distortion of near-extremal horizons is
constrained by their proximity to extremality. At the other extreme,
Melvin-Schwarzschild (MS) solutions may be infinitely distorted, however for
intermediate cases any non-zero charge or angular momentum restricts
distortions to be finite. These properties are in agreement with known theorems
but are seen to be satisfied in interesting and non-trivial ways.

Eulerian-space cosmological perturbation theory (SPT). Its problems include (1)
not capturing large-scale bulk flows [leading to an O(1) error in the 1-loop
SPT prediction for the baryon acoustic peak in the correlation function], (2)
assuming that the Universe behaves as a pressureless, inviscid fluid, and (3)
treating fluctuations on scales that are non-perturbative as if they were.
Recent studies have highlighted the successes of perturbation theory in
Lagrangian space or theories that solve equations for the effective dynamics of
smoothed fields. Both approaches mitigate some or all of the aforementioned
issues with SPT. We discuss these physical developments by specializing to the
simplified 1D case of gravitationally interacting sheets, which allows us to
substantially reduces the analytic overhead and still (as we show) maintain
many of the same behaviors as in 3D. In 1D, linear-order Lagrangian
perturbation theory (""the Zeldovich approximation"") is exact up to shell
crossing, and we prove that n^{th}-order Eulerian perturbation theory converges
to the Zeldovich approximation as n goes to infinity. In no 1D cosmology that
we consider (including a CDM-like case and power-law models) do these theories
describe accurately the matter power spectrum on any mildly nonlinear scale. We
find that theories based on effective equations are much more successful at
describing the dynamics. Finally, we discuss many topics that have recently
appeared in the perturbation theory literature such as beat coupling, the shift
and smearing of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, and the advantages of
Fourier versus configuration space. Our simplified 1D case serves as an
intuitive review of these perturbation theory results.

proximity of the 4f state to the Fermi energy, leading to strong coupling with
the conduction electrons. This coupling typically induces a variety of
competing ground states, including heavy-fermion metals, magnetism and
unconventional superconductivity. The d-wave superconductivity in CeTMIn5
(TM=Co, Rh, Ir) has attracted significant interest due to its qualitative
similarity to the cuprate high-Tc superconductors. Here, we show evidence for a
field induced phase-transition to a state akin to a density-wave (DW) in the
heavy fermion CeRhIn5, existing in proximity to its unconventional
superconductivity. The DW state is signaled by a hysteretic anomaly in the
in-plane resistivity accompanied by the appearance of non-linear electrical
transport at high magnetic fields (>27T), which are the distinctive
characteristics of density-wave states. The unusually large hysteresis enables
us to directly investigate the Fermi surface of a supercooled electronic system
and to clearly associate a Fermi surface reconstruction with the transition.
Key to our observation is the fabrication of single crystal microstructures,
which are found to be highly sensitive to ""subtle"" phase transitions involving
only small portions of the Fermi surface. Such subtle order might be a common
feature among correlated electron systems, and its clear observation adds a new
perspective on the similarly subtle CDW state in the cuprates.

are then not only explicitly background independent along the entire RG flow

self-interference has negative effects on the network throughput. In this
paper, we focus on a wireless network of nodes with both HD and FD capabilities
and derive and optimize the throughput in such a network. Our analytical result
shows that if the network is adapting an ALOHA protocol, the maximal throughput
is achieved by scheduling all concurrently transmitting nodes to work in either
FD mode or HD mode depending on one simple condition. Moreover, the effects of
imperfect self-interference cancellation on the signal-to-interference ratio

rigorously quantify the impact of imperfect self-interference cancellation on
the throughput gain, transmission range, and other metrics, and we establish

stereo depth perception, depth from monocular images is much more challenging.
Prior work typically focuses on exploiting geometric priors or additional
sources of information, most using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is
mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)
set new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering
the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be
naturally formulated as a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning
problem. Therefore, here we present a deep convolutional neural field model for
estimating depths from single monocular images, aiming to jointly explore the
capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. In particular, we propose a deep
structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of
continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. We then further propose an
equally effective model based on fully convolutional networks and a novel
superpixel pooling method, which is $\sim 10$ times faster, to speedup the
patch-wise convolutions in the deep model. With this more efficient model, we
are able to design deeper networks to pursue better performance. Experiments on

the carriers for water are similar in water content to the carbonaceous
chondrites in our Solar System. Here we suggest that the water content of
primitive bodies in many planetary systems may actually be much higher, as
carbonaceous chondrites have lost some of their original water due to heating
from short-lived radioisotopes that drove parent body alteration. Using N-body
simulations, we explore how planetary accretion would be different if bodies
beyond the water line contained a water mass fraction consistent with chemical
equilibrium calculations, and more similar to comets, as opposed to the more
traditional water-depleted values. We apply this model to consider planet
formation around stars of different masses and identify trends in the
properties of Habitable Zone planets and planetary system architecture which
could be tested by ongoing exoplanet census data collection. Comparison of such
data with the model predicted trends will serve to evaluate how well the N-body
simulations and the initial conditions used in studies of planetary accretion
can be used to understand this stage of planet formation.

of modern conservation biology. In the context of fisheries management and
marine ecosystem conservation, marine reserves often play a significant role to
achieve sustainable fisheries management. Consequently, a substantial number of
studies have been conducted to establish broad rules for the creation of MPAs,
or to test the effects of MPAs in specific regions. However, there still exist
many challenges for implementing MPAs that are effective at meeting their
goals. Deducing theoretical conditions guaranteeing that the introduction of
marine reserves will increase fisheries yields in age-structured population
dynamics is one such challenge. To derive such conditions, a simple
mathematical model is developed that follows an age-structured metapopulation
dynamics of a sedentary species. The obtained results suggest that a
sufficiently high fishing mortality rate and moderate recruitment success of an
individual's eggs is a necessary for marine reserves to increase fisheries
yields. The numerical calculations were conducted with the parameters of red
abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to visualize and to check validity of the
analytical results. They show good agreement with the analytical results, as
well as the results obtained in the previous works.

However, the offloaded users suffer from strong inter-tier interference, which
reduces the benefits of offloading and is one of the main limiting factors of
the system performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of an
interference nulling (IN) beamforming scheme to improve the system performance
by carefully managing the inter-tier interference to the offloaded users in

from stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression for the rate

i.e., the degrees of freedom that can be used for IN, to maximize the rate
coverage probability. Specifically, in the asymptotic scenario where the rate
threshold is small, by studying the order behavior of the rate coverage
probability, we characterize the optimal design parameter. For the general
scenario, we show some properties of the optimal design parameter. Finally, by
numerical simulations, we show the IN scheme can outperform both the simple

GW-detection range of $\sim$ 200 Mpc in short ($\lesssim$ 12-second) exposure
times for a week following the merger. Despite this sensitivity, a kilonova
search fully covering a fiducial localized area of $10$ $\mbox{deg}^2$ will not

surveys may be developed to optimize the likelihood of discovering kilonovae
efficiently within limited observing time. We estimate that a survey of $10$

dominated by overhead times; a survey further focused on galaxies exhibiting
high star-formation rates would require $\sim$ 5 hours. The characteristic time

likelihood of detecting kilonovae, by surveying sky areas associated with 50%,

distributions. Applying our approach, we are able to solve optimal commitments
for first-price and all-pay auctions in closed-form for fairly general
distribution settings. The optimal commitments functions in these auctions
reveal two surprisingly opposite insights: in the optimal commitment, the
leader bids passively when he has a low type. We interpret this as a credible
way to alleviate competition and to collude. In sharp contrast, when his type
is high enough, the leader sometimes would go so far as to bid above his own
value. We interpret this as a credible way to threat. Combing both insights, we
show via concrete examples that the leader is indeed willing to do so to secure
more utility when his type is in the middle. Our main approach consists of a
series of nontrivial innovations. In particular we put forward a concept called
equal-bid function that connects both players' strategies, as well as a concept
called equal-utility curve that smooths any leader strategy into a continuous
and differentiable strategy. We believe these techniques and insights are
general and can be applied to similar problems.

The framework is based on a previously introduced physics-based forward model
by Callahan and De Graef (2013) relating measured patterns to grain
orientations (Euler angle). The forward model is tuned to the microscope and
the sample symmetry group. We discretize the domain of the forward model onto a
dense grid of Euler angles and for each measured pattern we identify the most
similar patterns in the dictionary. These patterns are used to identify
boundaries, detect anomalies, and index crystal orientations. The statistical
distribution of these closest matches is used in an unsupervised binary
decision tree (DT) classifier to identify grain boundaries and anomalous
regions. The DT classifies a pattern as an anomaly if it has an abnormally low
similarity to any pattern in the dictionary. It classifies a pixel as being
near a grain boundary if the highly ranked patterns in the dictionary differ
significantly over the pixels 3x3 neighborhood. Indexing is accomplished by
computing the mean orientation of the closest dictionary matches to each
pattern. The mean orientation is estimated using a maximum likelihood approach
that models the orientation distribution as a mixture of Von Mises-Fisher
distributions over the quaternionic 3-sphere. The proposed dictionary matching
approach permits segmentation, anomaly detection, and indexing to be performed
in a unified manner with the additional benefit of uncertainty quantification.
We demonstrate the proposed dictionary-based approach on a Ni-base IN100 alloy.

maximise the separation in the colour-magnitude diagram between the two stellar
groups with different Fe and s-element content, and this index is not
significantly affected by variations in light elements (such as the O-Na
anticorrelation). The variations in the overall metallicity present in NGC5286

Here, we make such measurements using initially trapped Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) subject to an artificial magnetic field. Vortices are
nucleated in the BEC for artificial field strengths above a critical value,
which represents a structural phase transition. By comparing to
superfluid-hydrodynamic and Gross-Pitaevskii calculations, we confirmed that
the transition from the vortex-free state gives rise to a shear in the released
BEC's spatial distribution, representing a macroscopic method to measure this
transition, distinct from direct measurements of vortex entry. Shear is also
affected by an artificial electric field accompanying the artificial magnetic
field turn-off, which depends on the details of the physical mechanism creating
the artificial fields, and implies a natural choice of gauge. Measurements of
this kind offer opportunities for studying phase in less-well-understood

In particular, in safety-critical applications, such as X-ray computed
tomography in medical imaging or advanced driver assistance systems in the
automotive domain, timing is of utmost importance. A common approach to
maintain real-time capabilities of compute-intensive applications is to offload
those computations to dedicated accelerator hardware, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Programming such architectures is a
challenging task, with respect to the typical FPGA-specific design criteria:
Achievable overall algorithm latency and resource usage of FPGA primitives
(BRAM, FF, LUT, and DSP). High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dramatically simplifies
this task by enabling the description of algorithms in well-known higher
languages (C/C++) and its automatic synthesis that can be accomplished by HLS
tools. However, algorithm developers still need expert knowledge about the
target architecture, in order to achieve satisfying results. Therefore, in
previous work, we have shown that elevating the description of image algorithms
to an even higher abstraction level, by using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL),
can significantly cut down the complexity for designing such algorithms for
FPGAs. To give the developer even more control over the common trade-off,
latency vs. resource usage, we will present an automatic optimization process

We prove that these maps are Hurewicz fibrations with respect to some $W^{1,p}$

points of geometric costs for these affine control systems, proving that if the
base manifold is compact then the number of their critical points is infinite
(we use Lusternik-Schnirelmann category combined with the Hurewicz property).
In the special case where the control system is subriemannian this result can
be read as the corresponding version of Serre's theorem, on the existence of
infinitely many geodesics between two points on a compact riemannian manifold.
In the subriemannian case we show that the Hurewicz property holds for all
$p\geq1$ and the horizontal-loop space with the $W^{1,2}$ topology has the
homotopy type of a CW-complex (as long as the endpoint map has at least one
regular value); in particular the inclusion of the horizontal-loop space in the
ordinary one is a homotopy equivalence.

However, most of them are very complex and contain several tasks with different
complexities which result in varying requirements for computing architectures.
Nevertheless, a general processing scheme in every image processing application
has a similar structure, called image processing pipeline: (1) capturing an
image, (2) pre-processing using local operators, (3) processing with global
operators and (4) post-processing using complex operations. Therefore,
application-specialized hardware solutions based on heterogeneous architectures
are used for image processing. Unfortunately the development of applications
for heterogeneous hardware architectures is challenging due to the distribution
of computational tasks among processors and programmable logic units. Nowadays,
image processing systems are started from scratch which is time-consuming,
error-prone and inflexible. A new methodology for modeling and implementing is
needed in order to reduce the development time of heterogenous image processing
systems. This paper introduces a new holistic top down approach for image
processing systems. Two challenges have to be investigated. First, designers
ought to be able to model their complete image processing pipeline on an
abstract layer using UML. Second, we want to close the gap between the abstract
system and the system architecture.

the first part includes 18 M dwarfs with metallicities determined by
high-resolution spectroscopy and the second part contains 49 dwarfs with
metallicities obtained through moderate-resolution spectra. By applying this
calibration to a large sample of around 1.3 million M dwarfs from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the metallicity
distribution of this sample is determined and compared with those of previous
studies. Using photometric parallaxes, the Galactic heights of M dwarfs in the
large sample are also estimated. Our results show that stars farther from the
Galactic plane, on average, have lower metallicity, which can be attributed to
the age-metallicity relation. A scarcity of metal-poor dwarf stars in the
metallicity distribution relative to the Simple Closed Box Model indicates the
existence of the ""M dwarf problem,"" similar to the previously known G and K
dwarf problems. Several more complicated Galactic chemical evolution models
which have been proposed to resolve the G and K dwarf problems are tested and

controlling factor of structure change under the influence of temperature,
magnetic field, hydrostatic pressure. We should take into account that the
energy of elastic deformation is commensurate to the energy of electric
interactions and that is much higher than the rest of the bonds of lower energy
value. Besides, the energy elastic stresses are of long range, so it forms the
linearity in magnetization and bulk change. These regularities requires a
fundamental understanding of the laws of interaction with respect to accepted
interpretation of quantum mechanical forces of short range that are attributes
of magnetism formation. Due to the high sensitivity of electronic and resonance
properties with respect to small changes of the structure, we were able to
define the direct relation between elastic stresses and field-frequency
dependencies, as well as to analyze the evolution of the dynamics of phase
transitions and phase states. A cycle of studies of the influence of
hydrostatic pressure on the resonance properties are presented also. The
analysis of the effect of magnetic, magneto-elastic and elastic energy allowed
us to define the combinations of magneto-elastic interactions. The role of
elastic stresses in the linear changes of the magnetostriction, magnetization,
magnetoelasticity of single-crystal magnetic semiconductors is described in
details.

which the $c\to s\ell\nu_\ell$ transitions occur is well compatible with the
Standard Model predictions. Recent precise lattice calculations of the $D_s$
meson decay constant and form factors in $D\to K\ell\nu$ decays offer a
possibility to search for the small deviations from the Standard Model
predictions in the next generation of the high intensity flavour experiments.
We revisit constraints from these processes on the new physics contributions in
the effective theory approach. We investigate new physics effects which might
appear in the differential distributions for the longitudinally and
transversely polarised $K^\ast$ in $D\to K^\ast\ell\nu_\ell$ decays. Present
constraints from these observables are rather weak, but could be used to
constrain new physics effects in the future. In the case of $D\to K\ell\nu$ we
identify observables sensitive on new physics contribution coming from the
scalar Wilson coefficient, namely the forward-backward and the transversal muon
asymmetries. By allowing that new physics modifies only the second lepton
generation but not the first one, we identify allowed region for the
differential decay rate for the process $D\to K\mu\nu_\mu$ and find that it is
allowed to deviate from the Standard Model prediction by only few percent. The
lepton flavour universality violation can be tested in the ratio
$R_{\mu/e}(q^2)\equiv \frac{d\Gamma^{(\mu)}}{dq^2}/\frac{d\Gamma^{(e)}}{dq^2}$.
If the first lepton generation behaves as in the Standard Model, we find, using
current constraint on the scalar Wilson coefficient, that the ratio
$R_{\mu/e}(q^2)$ is currently allowed to be within the range $(0.9, 1.2)$,
depending on the value of $q^2$.

polyhedra with positive genus and vertex-transitive symmetry in 1984 the
question of complete classification of such objects in Euclidean 3-space has
been open. Due to a recent article by Gevay, Schulte, and Wills, we now know
that the genus range g>=2 can only admit a finite number of vertex-transitive
polyhedra, all with rotational Platonic symmetry. In this article, we show that
the symmetry group must also act simply transitively on the vertices.
Furthermore, the case of rotational tetrahedral symmetry is settled completely
- the unique example is already known.

long-range charge-density-wave order in a model of a layered system where such

low-temperature long-range order is stabilized by arbitrarily weak magnetic

presence of disorder. Like the field, disorder nucleates halos of

are compatible with various experimental trends, including the onset of longer

galaxies as observed by Swift, which provides well-sampled observations over a
much larger flux range and a much longer timescale than any other X-ray
observatory. We examine long-term variability of three AGN: NGC 1365 (see
Connolly et al. 2014), Mkn 335 and NGC 5548. At high fluxes, the 0.5-10 keV
spectra soften with increasing flux, as seen previously within the 2-10 keV
band. However, at very low fluxes the sources also become very soft. We have
fitted a number of models to the data and find that both intrinsic luminosity
variability and variable absorption are required to explain the observations.
In some systems, e.g. NGC 1365, the best explanation is a two-component wind
model in which one component represents direct emission absorbed by a disc wind
wind, with the absorbing column inversely proportional to the intrinsic
luminosity, and the second component represents unabsorbed emission reflected
from the wind. In other AGN the situation is more complex.

lag scaling as wavelength to the power 1.23 +/- 0.31, in excellent agreement

X-rays by the accretion disc. However, the observed lags are ~3 times longer
than expected from a standard Shakura-Sunyaev disc, raising real concerns about
the detailed validity of this model. The results can be explained with a
slightly larger mass and accretion rate, and a hotter disc, or if the disc is
clumpy, thereby enhancing the emission from the outer regions.

planetesimals near the tidal radius of about 1Rsun. Internal stress forces keep
the planetesimal from further tidal break-up when their radius is less than
about 100km. We speculate that the planetesimals then bind together to form new
sub-Earth - daughter-planets at a few solar radii around the WD. More massive
planets that contain hydrogen supply the WD with fresh nuclear fuel to
reincarnate its stellar-giant phase. Some of the hydrogen will be inflated in a
large envelope. The envelope blows a wind to form a nebula that is later (after
the entire envelope is lost) ionized by the hot WD. We term this glowing
ionized nebula that originated from a planet a real planetary nebula (RPN).

analysed also in the (3+1) scenario as a possible guiding principle towards the
description of (3+1) gravity. To this aim, a canonical classical $r$-matrix
arising from a Drinfel'd double structure for the three (3+1) Lorentzian

shown that this new quantum spacetime is not isomorphic to the

generators. Throughout the paper the cosmological constant appears as an

statistical query processing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random
noise into each query result, such that it is provably hard for the adversary
to infer the presence or absence of any individual record from the published
noisy results. The main objective in differentially private query processing is
to maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy
guarantees. Previous work, notably \cite{LHR+10}, has suggested that with an
appropriate strategy, processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole
achieves considerably higher accuracy than answering them individually.
However, to our knowledge there is currently no practical solution to find such
a strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods either return
strategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require
prohibitively expensive computations for even moderately large domains.
Motivated by this, we propose low-rank mechanism (LRM), the first practical
differentially private technique for answering batch linear queries with high
accuracy. LRM works for both exact (i.e., $\epsilon$-) and approximate (i.e.,
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-) differential privacy definitions. We derive the
utility guarantees of LRM, and provide guidance on how to set the privacy
parameters given the user's utility expectation. Extensive experiments using
real data demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art query processing solutions under differential privacy, by
large margins.

a central venue in which interacting many-body quantum systems are studied. The

condensed in the limit of infinite particle number and constant interaction
parameter [Lieb and Seiringer, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 88}, 170409 (2002)]. The
meaning of this result is that properties of the condensate, noticeably its
energy and density, converge to those obtained by minimizing the
Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional. This naturally raises the question whether
correlations are of any importance in this limit. Here, we demonstrate both
analytically and numerically that even in the infinite particle limit many-body
correlations can lead to a substantial modification of the \textit{variance} of
any operator compared to that expected from the Gross-Pitaevskii result. The
strong deviation of the variance stems from its explicit dependence on terms of
the reduced two-body density matrix which otherwise do not contribute to the
energy and density in this limit. This makes the variance a sensitive probe of
many-body correlations even when the energy and density of the system have
already converged to the Gross-Pitaevskii result. We use the center-of-mass
position operator to exemplify this persistence of correlations. Implications
of this many-body effect are discussed.

finally discuss model structures on the presheaf categories
$\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge$ over cubicalizations. We prove that
$\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge$ admits a model structure such that the simplicial
realization $\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge\to SSet$ is a left Quillen functor.
Moreover, in the case of $\square_G$ for group operads $G$, $\square^\wedge_G$
is a monoidal model category, and we have a sequence of monoidal Quillen
equivalences $\square Set \to \square_G^\wedge\to SSet$. For example, if $G=B$
is the group operad consisting of braid groups, the category $\square^\wedge_B$
is a braided monoidal model category whose homotopy category is equivalent to
that of $SSet$.

recognition involves some initial image processing steps like segmentation of

segmentation, learning very long range context is difficult and becomes
computationally intractable. Therefore, alternative soft decisions are needed
at the pre-processing level. This paper proposes a hybrid text recognizer using
a deep recurrent neural network with multiple layers of abstraction and long
range context along with a language model to verify the performance of the deep
neural network. In this paper we construct a multi-hypotheses tree architecture
with candidate segments of line sequences from different segmentation
algorithms at its different branches. The deep neural network is trained on
perfectly segmented data and tests each of the candidate segments, generating
unicode sequences. In the verification step, these unicode sequences are
validated using a sub-string match with the language model and best first
search is used to find the best possible combination of alternative hypothesis
from the tree structure. Thus the verification framework using language models
eliminates wrong segmentation outputs and filters recognition errors.

properties they have found applications in psychometrics, crystallography,
machine learning, wireless sensor networks, acoustics, and more. Despite the
usefulness of EDMs, they seem to be insufficiently known in the signal
processing community. Our goal is to rectify this mishap in a concise tutorial.
We review the fundamental properties of EDMs, such as rank or
(non)definiteness. We show how various EDM properties can be used to design
algorithms for completing and denoising distance data. Along the way, we
demonstrate applications to microphone position calibration, ultrasound
tomography, room reconstruction from echoes and phase retrieval. By spelling
out the essential algorithms, we hope to fast-track the readers in applying
EDMs to their own problems. Matlab code for all the described algorithms, and
to generate the figures in the paper, is available online. Finally, we suggest
directions for further research.

catastrophic, while others might be due to recurrent phenomena. The aim of
studying transients is to reveal the physical conditions causing them, in this
sense ideal targets for monitoring are transients in binary systems. In these
systems the physical process responsible for the transient depends directly or
indirectly on the interaction of the two components of the system. Here I
report on transients in stellar binary systems at two extremes of stellar
evolution: a T~Tauri system formed by two young low mass stellar objects, and
X-ray binary systems formed by a star and a neutron star or a black hole, i.e.,
end points in the life of massive stars. VLBI observations of the young binary
system V773 Tau A resolve the binary separation and can be overlapped with the
optical frame. Consecutive VLBI observations showing the evolution of the radio
emission with respect to the two stellar objects are an unvaluable tool for a
better understanding of the magnetic field topology of T Tauri stars. The
characteristics of radio jets in X-ray binaries are summarised and compared
with those of the radio emission of the gamma-ray binary LS I +61303. Timing
analysis of radio and Fermi-LAT observations provide constraints for
theoretical models that can be tested by VLBI observations.

superconducting materials is important because the interactions that drive
nematic order may also mediate the Cooper pairing. Nematic order breaks
fourfold rotational symmetry in the iron plane, which is believed to be driven
by either orbital or spin degrees of freedom. However, as the nematic phase
often develops at a temperature just above or coincides with a stripe magnetic
phase transition, experimentally determining the dominant driving force of
nematic order is difficult. Here, we use neutron scattering to study
structurally the simplest iron-based superconductor FeSe, which displays a
nematic (orthorhombic) phase transition at $T_s=90$ K, but does not order
antiferromagnetically. Our data reveal substantial stripe spin fluctuations,
which are coupled with orthorhombicity and are enhanced abruptly on cooling to
below $T_s$. Moreover, a sharp spin resonance develops in the superconducting
state, whose energy (~4 meV) is consistent with an electron boson coupling mode
revealed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, thereby suggesting a spin
fluctuation-mediated sign-changing pairing symmetry. By normalizing the dynamic
susceptibility into absolute units, we show that the magnetic spectral weight
in FeSe is comparable to that of the iron arsenides. Our findings support
recent theoretical proposals that both nematicity and superconductivity are
driven by spin fluctuations.

Single-phase ceramics were synthesized for both LMT and NMT at sintering
temperatures from 1250 degree C to 1675 degree C. On the basis of the XRD
analysis we have found that the LMT and NMT compounds have cubic and monoclinic
crystal structures, respectively. We have also observed that the relative
densities of LMT and NMT vary between about 93 and 99% of the theoretical
density, depending on the sintering temperature. Finally, concerning the
dielectric properties of the microwave resonators made of LMT and NMT compounds
we have measured their temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency
({\tau}f) and the quality factor (Q). It is interesting to notice that
({\tau}f) in the case of the NMT compound (-16 ppm 1/K) is essentially smaller
than in the case of the LMT compound (-72 ppm 1/K), therefore proving a better
stability against temperature variations in the NMT based resonators. On the
other hand, the Q values are very similar, being 34000 at the resonance
frequency of 8.07 GHz and 38000 at the resonance frequency of 9.76 GHz in the

transport in a normal metal-ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor (NFIS)
junction, and explore the possibility of its use as a sensitive thermometer. We
investigated the transfer functions and the intrinsic noise performance for
different measurement configurations. A common feature of all configurations is
that the best temperature noise performance is obtained in the non-linear
temperature regime for a structure based on an europium chalcogenide
ferromagnetic insulator in contact with a superconducting Al film structure.
For an open-circuit configuration, although the maximal intrinsic temperature
sensitivity can achieve $10$nKHz$^{-1/2}$, a realistic amplifying chain will
reduce the sensitivity up to $10$$\mu$KHz$^{-1/2}$. To overcome this limitation
we propose a measurement scheme in a closed-circuit configuration based on
state-of-art SQUID detection technology in an inductive setup. In such a case
we show that temperature noise can be as low as $35$nKHz$^{-1/2}$. We also
discuss a temperature-to-frequency converter where the obtained thermo-voltage
developed over a Josephson junction operated in the dissipative regime is
converted into a high-frequency signal. We predict that the structure can
generate frequencies up to $\sim 120$GHz, and transfer functions up to
$200$GHz/K at around $\sim 1$K. If operated as electron thermometer, the device
may provide temperature noise lower than $35$nKHz$^{-1/2}$ thereby being
potentially attractive for radiation sensing applications.

of diamond NV sensors and diamond quantum devices on diamond chips. The
Photocurrent Detection of Magnetic Resonance (PDMR) scheme is based on the
detection of charge carriers promoted to the conduction band of diamond by the
two-photon ionization of NV- centres. Optical detection of magnetic resonance
(ODMR) and PDMR are compared, by performing both measurements simultaneously.
The minima detected in the measured photocurrent at resonant microwave
frequencies are attributed to the spin-dependent occupation probability of the
NV- ground state, originating from spin-selective non-radiative transitions.

self-gravitating filaments, to investigate their longitudinal collapse
timescales; these timescales are important because they determine the time
available for a filament to fragment into cores. A filament is initially
characterised by its line-mass, $\mu$, its radius, $R$ (or equivalently its
density $\rho\!=\!\mu/\pi R^2$), and its aspect ratio, $A\;\,(\equiv Z/R$,
where $Z$ is its half-length). The gas is only allowed to contract
longitudinally, i.e. parallel to the symmetry axis of the filament (the
$z$-axis). Pon et al. (2012) have considered the global dynamics of such
filaments analytically. They conclude that short filaments ($A\! < \!5$)
collapse along the $z$-axis more-or-less homologously, on a time-scale
$t_{_{\rm HOM}} \sim 0.44\,A\,(G\rho)^{-1/2}$; in contrast, longer filaments
($A\! > \!5$) undergo end-dominated collapse, i.e. two dense clumps form at the
ends of the filament and converge on the centre sweeping up mass as they go, on
a time-scale $t_{_{\rm END}} \sim 0.98\,A^{1/2}\,(G\rho)^{-1/2}$. Our
simulations do not corroborate these predictions. First, for all $A\! > \!2$,
the collapse time satisfies a single equation \[t_{_{\rm
COL}}\;\sim\;(0.49+0.26A)(G\rho)^{-1/2}\,,\] which for large $A$ is much longer
than the Pon et al. prediction. Second, for all $A\! > \!2$, the collapse is
end-dominated. Third, before being swept up, the gas immediately ahead of an
end-clump is actually accelerated outwards by the gravitational attraction of
the approaching clump, resulting in a significant ram pressure. For high aspect
ratio filaments the end-clumps approach an asymptotic inward speed, due to the
fact that they are doing work both accelerating and compressing the gas they
sweep up. Pon et al. appear to have neglected the outward acceleration and its
consequences.

growth of possible molecules and reactions between them. Here in particular the
combinatorial complexity of the HCN polymerisation and hydrolysation networks
forms the computational bottleneck. As a consequence, guidance of the

narrowing of the absorption spectrum of the atomic column of thickness L equal
to $\lambda/2$ and to $\lambda$(with $\lambda = 770\un{nm}$ being the resonant

PHY-PCRAS (ANA-PHY-PCRAS) for practical orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, where the Tikhonov-distributed artificial
noise is introduced to interfere with the phase-modulated key for resisting
potential key-recovery attacks whenever a static channel between two legitimate
users is unfortunately encountered. Then, we address various practical issues
for ANA-PHY-PCRAS with OFDM transmission, including correlation among
subchannels, imperfect carrier and timing recoveries. Among them, we show that
the effect of sampling offset is very significant and a search procedure in the
frequency domain should be incorporated for verification. With practical OFDM
transmission, the number of uncorrelated subchannels is often not sufficient.
Hence, we employ a time-separated approach for allocating enough subchannels
and a modified ANA-PHY-PCRAS is proposed to alleviate the discontinuity of
channel phase at far-separated time slots. Finally, the key equivocation is
derived for the worst case scenario. We conclude that the enhanced security of
ANA-PHY-PCRAS comes from the uncertainty of both the wireless channel and
introduced artificial noise, compared to the traditional challenge-response
authentication scheme implemented at the upper layer.

measured resistance, superfluid density, and tunneling spectra result from the
percolative connection of superconducting ""puddles"" with randomly distributed
critical temperatures, embedded in a weakly localizing metallic matrix. We

helimagnet CrAs has attracted much attention. How superconductivity emerges
from the magnetic state and what is the mechanism of the superconducting
pairing are two important issues which need to be resolved. In the present
work, the suppression of magnetism and the occurrence of superconductivity in
CrAs as a function of pressure ($p$) were studied by means of muon spin
rotation. The magnetism remains bulk up to $p\simeq3.5$~kbar while its volume
fraction gradually decreases with increasing pressure until it vanishes at
$p\simeq$7~kbar. At 3.5 kbar superconductivity abruptly appears with its
maximum $T_c \simeq 1.2$~K which decreases upon increasing the pressure. In the
intermediate pressure region ($3.5\lesssim p\lesssim 7$~kbar) the
superconducting and the magnetic volume fractions are spatially phase separated
and compete for phase volume. Our results indicate that the less conductive
magnetic phase provides additional carriers (doping) to the superconducting
parts of the CrAs sample thus leading to an increase of the transition
temperature ($T_c$) and of the superfluid density ($\rho_s$). A scaling of
$\rho_s$ with $T_c^{3.2}$ as well as the phase separation between magnetism and
superconductivity point to a conventional mechanism of the Cooper-pairing in
CrAs.

spectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope. It is optimally designed for
radial-velocity surveys of M dwarfs with potentially habitable Earth-mass
planets. Aims. We prepare a list of the brightest, single M dwarfs in each
spectral subtype observable from the northern hemisphere, from which we will
select the best planet-hunting targets for CARMENES. Methods. In this first
paper on the preparation of our input catalogue, we compiled a large amount of
public data and collected low-resolution optical spectroscopy with CAFOS at the
2.2 m Calar Alto telescope for 753 stars. We derived accurate spectral types
using a dense grid of standard stars, a double least-squares minimisation
technique, and 31 spectral indices previously defined by other authors.
Additionally, we quantified surface gravity, metallicity, and chromospheric
activity for all the stars in our sample. Results. We calculated spectral types
for all 753 stars, of which 305 are new and 448 are revised. We measured
pseudo-equivalent widths of Halpha for all the stars in our sample, concluded
that chromospheric activity does not affect spectral typing from our indices,
and tabulated 49 stars that had been reported to be young stars in open
clusters, moving groups, and stellar associations. Of the 753 stars, two are
new subdwarf candidates, three are T Tauri stars, 25 are giants, 44 are K
dwarfs, and 679 are M dwarfs. Many of the 261 investigated dwarfs in the range
M4.0-8.0 V are among the brightest stars known in their spectral subtype.
Conclusions. This collection of low-resolution spectroscopic data serves as a
candidate target list for the CARMENES survey and can be highly valuable for
other radial-velocity surveys of M dwarfs and for studies of cool dwarfs in the
solar neighbourhood.

Submitted to MNRAS 2 months ago, no report yet (!)",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation,
requires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas
giant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling
in the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around
metal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide
range of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these
observations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation
hypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis
calculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations
of the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and
not even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the
inner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star
metallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these
smaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around
the Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low
metallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,
whereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow
contract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,
simulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity
preference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known
directly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor.

joint design of the hybrid backhaul links (i.e., designing the wireline and

(i.e., determining the sparse beamforming solution from the BSs to the users).
The paper formulates the hybrid backhaul and access link design problem by
minimizing the total network power consumption. The paper solves the problem
using a two-stage heuristic algorithm. At one stage, the sparse beamforming
solution is found using a weighted mixed `1=`2 norm minimization approach; the
correlation matrix of the quantization noise of the wireline backhaul links is
computed using the classical rate-distortion theory. At the second stage, the
transmit powers of the wireless backhaul links are found by solving a power
minimization problem subject to quality-of-service constraints, based on the
principle of conservation of rate by utilizing the rates found in the first
stage. Simulation results suggest that the performance of the proposed
algorithm approaches the global optimum solution, especially at high

independent and identically distributed across different contention slots. To
quantify the roles of both the energy state information (ESI) and the channel

Then, the optimal throughput and the optimal scheduling strategy are obtained
via one-dimension search, i.e., an iterative algorithm consisting of the
following two steps in each iteration: First, assuming that the stored energy
level at each transmitter is stationary with a given distribution, the expected
throughput maximization problem is formulated as an optimal stopping problem,
whose solution is proved to exist and then derived for both models; second, for
a fixed stopping rule, the energy level at each transmitter is shown to be
stationary and an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to compute its
steady-state distribution. Finally, we validate our analysis by numerical

polarized in the a-b planes. Instead of the simple Drude model that assumes a
single band, above $T_c$ the normal-state optical properties are best described
by the two-Drude model that considers two separate electronic subsystems; we
observe a weak response ($\omega_{p,D;1}\simeq 3000$ cm$^{-1}$) where the
scattering rate has a strong temperature dependence ($1/\tau_{D,1}\simeq 32$
cm$^{-1}$ for $T \gtrsim T_c$), and a strong response ($\omega_{p,D;2}\simeq
14\,500$ cm$^{-1}$) with a large scattering rate ($1/\tau_{D,2}\simeq 1720$
cm$^{-1}$) that is essentially temperature independent. The multiband nature of
this material precludes the use of the popular generalized-Drude approach
commonly applied to single-band materials, implying that any structure observed
in the frequency dependent scattering rate $1/\tau(\omega)$ is spurious and it
cannot be used as the foundation for optical inversion techniques to determine
an electron-boson spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)$. Below $T_c$ the
optical conductivity is best described using two superconducting optical gaps
of $2\Delta_1\simeq 45$ and $2\Delta_2 \simeq 90$ cm$^{-1}$ applied to the

bands are vastly different at low temperature, placing this material
simultaneously in both clean and dirty limit. Interestingly, this material

insights on the structural and magnetic changes in the sub-surface layers of
the Sun during this on-going unusual period of low activity. We analyze 18
years of continuous observations of the solar acoustic oscillations collected
by the Sun-as-a-star GOLF instrument onboard the SoHO spacecraft. From the
fitted mode frequencies, the temporal variability of the frequency shifts of
the radial, dipolar, and quadrupolar modes are studied for different frequency
ranges which are sensitive to different layers in the solar sub-surface
interior. The low-frequency modes show nearly unchanged frequency shifts
between Cycles 23 and 24, with a time evolving signature of the quasi-biennial
oscillation, which is particularly visible for the quadrupole component
revealing the presence of a complex magnetic structure. The modes at higher
frequencies show frequency shifts 30% smaller during Cycle~24, which is in
agreement with the decrease observed in the surface activity between Cycles 23

structural and magnetic changes responsible for the frequency shifts remained
comparable between Cycle 23 and Cycle 24 in the deeper sub-surface layers below
1400 km as revealed by the low-frequency modes. The frequency shifts of the
higher-frequency modes, sensitive to shallower regions, show that Cycle 24 is

metals, which may be connected to their nontrivial topological properties,
particularly to chiral anomaly. We argue that there are two basic phenomena,
which are related to chiral anomaly in Weyl metals: Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE)
and Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). While AHE is in principle present in any
ferromagnetic metal, we demonstrate that a magnetic Weyl metal is distinguished
from an ordinary ferromagnetic metal by the absence of the extrinsic and the
Fermi surface part of the intrinsic contributions to the AHE, as long as the
Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl nodes. The AHE in a Weyl metal
is thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by
the location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone. In other words, a
ferromagnetic Weyl metal may be thought of as the only example of a
ferromagnetic metal with a purely intrinsic AHE. We further develop a fully
microscopic theory of diffusive magnetotransport in Weyl metals. We derive
coupled diffusion equations for the total and axial (i.e. node-antisymmetric)
charge densities and show that chiral anomaly manifests as a
magnetic-field-induced coupling between them. We demonstrate that an
experimentally-observable consequence of CME in magnetotransport in Weyl metals
is a quadratic negative magnetoresistance, which will dominate all other
contributions to magnetoresistance under certain conditions and may be regarded
as a smoking-gun transport characteristic, unique to Weyl metals.

systems modeled with Petri nets as a collection of components synchronizing on
common observable transitions, where faults can occur in several components.
The diagnosability analysis of the entire system is done in parallel by
verifying the interaction of each component with the fault free versions of the
other components. Furthermore, we use existing efficient methods and tools, in
particular parallel LTL-X model checking based on unfoldings, for
diagnosability verification.

  sequences","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing",,"10.1109/TIP.2015.2445294",,"cs.MM cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Binary local features represent an effective alternative to real-valued
descriptors, leading to comparable results for many visual analysis tasks,
while being characterized by significantly lower computational complexity and
memory requirements. When dealing with large collections, a more compact
representation based on global features is often preferred, which can be
obtained from local features by means of, e.g., the Bag-of-Visual-Word (BoVW)
model. Several applications, including for example visual sensor networks and
mobile augmented reality, require visual features to be transmitted over a
bandwidth-limited network, thus calling for coding techniques that aim at
reducing the required bit budget, while attaining a target level of efficiency.
In this paper we investigate a coding scheme tailored to both local and global
binary features, which aims at exploiting both spatial and temporal redundancy
by means of intra- and inter-frame coding. In this respect, the proposed coding
scheme can be conveniently adopted to support the Analyze-Then-Compress (ATC)
paradigm. That is, visual features are extracted from the acquired content,
encoded at remote nodes, and finally transmitted to a central controller that
performs visual analysis. This is in contrast with the traditional approach, in
which visual content is acquired at a node, compressed and then sent to a
central unit for further processing, according to the Compress-Then-Analyze
(CTA) paradigm. In this paper we experimentally compare ATC and CTA by means of
rate-efficiency curves in the context of two different visual analysis tasks:
homography estimation and content-based retrieval. Our results show that the
novel ATC paradigm based on the proposed coding primitives can be competitive
with CTA, especially in bandwidth limited scenarios.

implemented by RBI.CTS uses cheque image, instead of the physical cheque
itself, for cheque clearance thus reducing the turn around time drastically.
This approach holds back the physical movement of cheque from presenting bank
to the drawee bank. In CTS, digital image of the cheque is protected using
standard public key and symmetric key encryptions like RSA, triple DES etc.
This involves a lot of computation overhead and key management. The security
also depends on the hard mathematical problem and is only computationally
secure.Information theoretically secure, secret image sharing techniques can be
used in the CTS for the secure and efficient processing of cheque image .In
this paper, we propose two simple and efficient secret image sharing schemes
and a Cheque Truncation System based on these algorithms . In the proposed
scheme,the presenting bank is acting as the dealer and the participants are the
customer, and the drawee bank.The dealer should generate the shares of cheque
and distributes it to customer and drawee bank.The validity of the shares are
important during the reconstruction process. The proposed scheme also suggests
a method for cheating detection which identify any invalid shares submitted by
the customers, using the hashing technique. The experimental results shows that
the proposed scheme is efficient and secure compared with the existing scheme.

therefore the dynamics of this process, besides other factors, depend on the

exponential and power law. We performed extensive stochastic simulations to
study the adaptation dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes, and identified two
quantities that can be used to distinguish the underlying distribution of
beneficial fitness effects. The first quantity studied here is the fitness
difference between successive mutations that spread in the population, which is
found to decrease in the case of truncated distributions, remain nearly a
constant for exponentially decaying distributions and increase when the fitness
distribution decays as a power law. The second quantity of interest, namely,
the rate of change of fitness with time also shows quantitatively different
behaviour for different beneficial fitness distributions. The patterns
displayed by the two aforementioned quantities are found to hold for both low
and high mutation rates. We discuss how these patterns can be exploited to
determine the distribution of beneficial fitness effects in microbial
experiments.

decomposes any data into a small number of `Fourier intrinsic band functions'

amplitudes and frequencies of a time series by the Fourier method itself. We
propose an idea of zero-phase filter bank based multivariate FDM (MFDM)
algorithm, for the analysis of multivariate nonlinear and nonstationary time
series, from the FDM. We also present an algorithm to obtain cutoff frequencies
for MFDM. The MFDM algorithm is generating finite number of band limited
multivariate FIBFs (MFIBFs). The MFDM preserves some intrinsic physical
properties of the multivariate data, such as scale alignment, trend and
instantaneous frequency. The proposed methods produce the results in a
time-frequency-energy distribution that reveal the intrinsic structures of a
