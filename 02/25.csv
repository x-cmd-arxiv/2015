attributed to tidal deformation, mainly due to Europa's eccentric orbit.
Although the surface is geologically young (30 - 80 Myr), there is little
information as to whether tidally-driven surface processes are ongoing.
However, a recent detection of water vapor near Europa's south pole suggests
that it may be geologically active. Initial observations indicated that
Europa's plume eruptions are time-variable and may be linked to its tidal
cycle. Saturn's moon, Enceladus, which shares many similar traits with Europa,
displays tidally-modulated plume eruptions, which bolstered this
interpretation. However, additional observations of Europa at the same time in
its orbit failed to yield a plume detection, casting doubt on the tidal control
hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to analyze the timing of plume
eruptions within the context of Europa's tidal cycle to determine whether such
a link exists and examine the inferred similarities and differences between
plume activity on Europa and Enceladus.

While this classical theory explains many quantum phenomena related to harmonic

this work the hydrogen ground state is studied by numerically solving the
Abraham -- Lorentz equation in the dipole approximation. First the stochastic
Gaussian field is represented by a sum over Gaussian frequency components, next
the dynamics is solved numerically using OpenCL. The approach improves on work
by Cole and Zou 2003 by treating the full $3d$ problem and reaching longer

state phase space density. Though short time results suggest a trend towards
confirmation, in all attempted modelings the atom ionises at longer times.

solving ion distribution of aqueous electrolytes nanoconfined by uncharged

Substantial electroneutrality breakdown in nanoconfined regions and very

strongly on the propensity of anions toward the water-carbon interface and such

dragonfly takes off while changing the flight direction at the same time.
Center of mass was elevated about 1-2 body lengths. Five of these maneuvers
were selected for 3D body surface reconstruction and the body orientation
measurement. In oppose to conventional banked turn model, which neglects
interactions between the rotational motions, in this study we investigated the
strength of the dynamic coupling by dividing pitch, roll and yaw angular
accelerations into two contributions: one from aerodynamic torque and one from
dynamic coupling effect. The latter term is referred to as Dynamic Coupling
Acceleration (DCA). The DCA term can be measured directly from instantaneous
rotational velocities of the insect. We found a strong correlation between
pitch and yaw velocities at the end of each wingbeat and the time integral of
the corresponding DCA term. Generation of pitch, roll and yaw torques requires
different aerodynamic mechanisms and is limited due to the other requirements
of the flight. Our results suggest that employing DCA term gives the insect
capability to perform a variety of maneuvers without fine adjustments in the
aerodynamic torque.

announcement of a possible transition to a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar
state, inferred from decreases in optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray flux from the
source. We report the detection of significant (5$\sigma$) gamma-ray pulsations
after the transition, at the known spin period, using ~1 year of data from the
Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The
gamma-ray light curve of PSR J1227-4853 can be fit by one broad peak, which
occurs at nearly the same phase as the main peak in the 1.4 GHz radio profile.
The partial alignment of light-curve peaks in different wavebands suggests that
at least some of the radio emission may originate at high altitude in the
pulsar magnetosphere, in extended regions co-located with the gamma-ray
emission site. We folded the LAT data at the orbital period, both pre- and
post-transition, but find no evidence for significant modulation of the
gamma-ray flux. Analysis of the gamma-ray flux over the mission suggests an
approximate transition time of 2012 November 30. Continued study of the pulsed
emission and monitoring of PSR J1227-4853, and other known redback systems, for
subsequent flux changes will increase our knowledge of the pulsar emission

during the pressure-driven expansion of an HII region using the chemo-dynamical
model MARION. Dust size distribution is represented by four dust types:
conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), very small grains (VSGs),
big grains (BGs) and also intermediate-sized grains (ISGs), which are larger
than VSGs and smaller than BGs. The dust is assumed to move at terminal
velocity determined locally from the balance between the radiation pressure and
gas drag. As Coulomb drag is an important contribution to the overall gas drag,
we evaluate a grain charge evolution within the HII region for each dust type.
BGs are effectively swept out of the HII region. The spatial distribution of
ISGs within the HII region has a double peak structure, with a smaller inner
peak and a higher outer peak. PAHs and VSGs are mostly coupled to the gas. The
mean charge of PAHs is close to zero, so they can become neutral from time to
time because of charge fluctuations. These periods of neutrality occur often
enough to cause the removal of PAHs from the very interior of the HII region.
For VSGs, the effect of charge fluctuations is less pronounced but still
significant. We conclude that accounting for charge dispersion is necessary to
describe the dynamics of small grains.

14. Pronounced effects in the spectrum are also caused by resonant $\Delta v_8

  Deployment of a Wireless Relay Network along a Line","29 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1308.0686",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We are motivated by the need, in some applications, for impromptu or
as-you-go deployment of wireless sensor networks. A person walks along a line,
starting from a sink node (e.g., a base-station), and proceeds towards a source
node (e.g., a sensor) which is at an a priori unknown location. At equally
spaced locations, he makes link quality measurements to the previous relay, and
deploys relays at some of these locations, with the aim to connect the source
to the sink by a multihop wireless path. In this paper, we consider two
approaches for impromptu deployment: (i) the deployment agent can only move
forward (which we call a pure as-you-go approach), and (ii) the deployment
agent can make measurements over several consecutive steps before selecting a
placement location among them (which we call an explore-forward approach). We
consider a light traffic regime, and formulate the problem as a Markov decision
process, where the trade-off is among the power used by the nodes, the outage
probabilities in the links, and the number of relays placed per unit distance.
We obtain the structures of the optimal policies for the pure as-you-go
approach as well as for the explore-forward approach. We also consider natural
heuristic algorithms, for comparison. Numerical examples show that the
explore-forward approach significantly outperforms the pure as-you-go approach.
Next, we propose two learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach,
based on Stochastic Approximation, which asymptotically converge to the set of
optimal policies, without using any knowledge of the radio propagation model.
We demonstrate numerically that the learning algorithms can converge (as
deployment progresses) to the set of optimal policies reasonably fast and,
hence, can be practical, model-free algorithms for deployment over large
regions.

automatic verification. Unfortunately their correctness criteria -
linearizability with respect to given ADT specifications - are hard to verify.
Even on classes of implementations where the usual temporal safety properties
like control-state reachability are decidable, linearizability is undecidable.
  In this work we demonstrate that verifying linearizability for certain fixed
ADT specifications is reducible to control-state reachability, despite being
harder for arbitrary ADTs. We effectuate this reduction for several of the most
popular atomic objects. This reduction yields the first decidability results
for verification without bounding the number of concurrent threads.
Furthermore, it enables the application of existing safety-verification tools

permanently, by recirculation cells which are ubiquitous in natural or
industrial flows. In the limit of small particle inertia, determining the
conditions of trapping is a challenging task, as it requires a large number of
numerical simulations or experiments to test various particle sizes or
densities. Here, we investigate this phenomenon analytically and numerically in
the case of heavy particles (e.g. aerosols) at low Reynolds number, to derive a
trapping criterion that can be used both in analytical and numerical velocity
fields. The resulting criterion allows to predict the characteristics of
trapped particles as soon as single-phase simulations of the flow are
performed. Our analysis is valid for two-dimensional particle-laden flows in
the vertical plane, in the limit where the particle inertia, the free-fall
terminal velocity, and the flow unsteadiness can be treated as perturbations.
The weak unsteadiness of the flow generally induces a chaotic tangle near
heteroclinic or homoclinic cycles if any, leading to the apparent diffusion of
fluid elements through the boundary of the cell. The critical particle Stokes
number Stc below which aerosols also enter and exit the cell in a complex
manner has been derived analytically, in terms of the flow characteristics. It
involves the non-dimensional curvature-weighted integral of the squared
velocity of the steady fluid flow along the dividing streamline of the
recirculation cell. When the flow is unsteady and St > Stc, a regular motion
takes place due to gravity and centrifugal effects, like in the steady case.
Particles driven towards the interior of the cell are trapped permanently. In
contrast, when the flow is unsteady and St < Stc, particles wander in a chaotic
manner in the vicinity of the border of the cell, and can escape the cell.

dimensional feature selection. As a preselection method, it selects a moderate
size subset of candidate variables for further refining via feature selection
to produce the final model. The performance of variable screening depends on
both computational efficiency and the ability to dramatically reduce the number
of variables without discarding the important ones. When the data dimension $p$
is substantially larger than the sample size $n$, variable screening becomes
crucial as 1) Faster feature selection algorithms are needed; 2) Conditions
guaranteeing selection consistency might fail to hold. This article studies a
class of linear screening methods and establishes consistency theory for this
special class. In particular, we prove the restricted diagonally dominant (RDD)
condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for strong screening
consistency. As concrete examples, we show two screening methods $SIS$ and
$HOLP$ are both strong screening consistent (subject to additional constraints)
with large probability if $n > O((\rho s + \sigma/\tau)^2\log p)$ under random
designs. In addition, we relate the RDD condition to the irrepresentable
condition, and highlight limitations of $SIS$.

microseconds. Here, we report an analysis of Arecibo 59.5 $\mu$sec-resolution
polarimetric observations of 11 P-band and 32 L-band pulsars with periods
ranging from 150 msec to 3.7 sec. These higher frequency observations forms the
most reliable basis for detailed microstructure studies. Close inspection of
individual pulses reveals that most pulses exhibit quasiperiodicities with a
well-defined periodicity timescale ($P_{\mu}$). While we find some pulses with
deeply modulating microstructure, most pulses show low-amplitude modulations on
top of broad smooth subpulses features, thereby making it difficult to infer
periodicities. We have developed a method for such low-amplitude fluctuations
wherein a smooth subpulse envelope is subtracted from each de-noised subpulse;
the fluctuating portion of each subpulse is then used to estimate $P_{\mu}$ via
autocorrelation analysis. We find that the microstructure timescale $P_{\mu}$
is common across all Stokes parameters of polarized pulsar signals. Moreover,
no clear signature of curvature radiation in vacuum in highly resolved
microstructures was found. Our analysis further shows strong correlation
between $P_\mu$ and the pulsar period $P$. We discuss implications of this
result in terms of a coherent radiation model wherein radio emission arises due
to formation and acceleration of electron-positron pairs in an inner vacuum gap
over magnetic polar cap, and a subpulse corresponds to a series of
non-stationary sparking discharges. We argue that in this model, $P_{\mu}$
reflects the temporal modulation of non-stationary plasma flow.

device has no choice but to fall back on its cellular network for localization.
Due to random variations in the channel conditions to its surrounding base
stations (BS), the mobile device is likely to face a mix of both favorable and
unfavorable geometries for localization. Analytical studies of localization
performance (e.g., using the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound) usually require that
one fix the BS geometry, and favorable geometries have always been the
preferred choice in the literature. However, not only are the resulting
analytical results constrained to the selected geometry, this practice is
likely to lead to overly-optimistic expectations of typical localization
performance. Ideally, localization performance should be studied across all
possible geometric setups, thereby also removing any selection bias. This,
however, is known to be hard and has been carried out only in simulation. In
this paper, we develop a new tractable approach where we endow the BS locations
with a distribution by modeling them as a Poisson point process (PPP), and use
tools from stochastic geometry to obtain easy-to-use expressions for key
performance metrics. In particular, we focus on the probability of detecting
some minimum number of BSs, which is shown to be closely coupled with a network
operator's ability to obtain satisfactory localization performance (e.g., meet
FCC E911 requirements). This metric is indifferent to the localization
technique (e.g., TOA, TDOA, AOA, or hybrids thereof), though different
techniques will presumably lead to different BS hearability requirements. In
order to mitigate excessive interference due to the presence of dominant
interferers in the form of other BSs, we incorporate both BS coordination and
frequency reuse in the proposed framework and quantify the resulting
performance gains analytically.

coordinated leadership, or aggregated information about the population, are
needed to facilitate a solution. Evolutionary theories of social conventions,

important to the micro-physics of warm clouds. We have numerically investigated
stably stratified interfaces by locally perturbing at an initial instant the
standard temperature lapse rate at the cloud interface and then observing the
temporal evolution of the system. When the buoyancy term becomes of the same
order of the inertial one, we observe a spatial redistribution of the kinetic
energy which produce a concomitant pit of kinetic energy within the mixing
layer. In this situation, the mixing layer contains two interfacial regions
with opposite kinetic energy gradient, which in turn produces two intermittent
sublayers in the velocity fluctuations field. This changes the structure of the
field with respect to the corresponding non-stratified shearless mixing: the
communication between the two turbulent region is weak, and the growth of the

found to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words
belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic

different applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation
abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document
retrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between
the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their
corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web

Condensates (BECs) is discussed using two approaches. In the first approach,
the wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended

organize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the
terms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation.
Going to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov
approximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\""{o}dinger picture
and to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to
track different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the

fails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error
(measured by the trace distance of the two-particle reduced density matrices)
of PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making
PCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the
error of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system
evolves for longer times. I derive both time-dependent and -independent
equations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz. The
time complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on $N$ and is linear in the
number of orbitals in use.

some recent work by the authors in which ""forced"" grading constructions have
played a significant role in the representation theory of semisimple algebraic
groups $G$ in positive characteristic. The constructions begin with natural
finite dimensional quotients of the distribution algebras Dist$(G)$, but then
""force"" gradings into the picture by passing to positively graded algebras
constructed from ideal filtrations of these quotients. This process first
guaranteed a place for itself by proving, for large primes, that all Weyl
modules have $p$-Weyl filtrations. Later it led, under similar circumstances,
to a new ""good filtration"" result for restricted Lie algebra Ext groups between
restricted irreducible $G$-modules. In the process of proving these results, a
new kind of graded algebra was invented, called a Q-Koszul algebra. Recent
conjectures suggest these algebras arise in forced grading constructions as
above, from quotients of Dist$(G)$, even for small primes and even in settings
possibly involving singular weights. Related conjectures suggest a promising
future for using Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to relate quantum and algebraic group
cohomology and Ext groups in these same small prime and possibly singular
weight settings. A part of one of these conjectures is proved in Part II of
this paper. The proof is introduced by remarks of general interest on
positively graded algebras and Morita equivalence, followed by a discussion of
recent Koszulity results of Shan-Varagnalo-Vasserot, observing some extensions.

depends on the inherent quality of the agent; the agent's quality is fixed but

the agents. The auctioneer is required to elicit costs as well as capacities
(making the mechanism design bidimensional) and further, learn the qualities of
the agents as well, with a view to maximize her utility. Motivated by this, we
design a bidimensional multi-armed bandit procurement auction that seeks to
maximize the expected utility of the auctioneer subject to incentive
compatibility and individual rationality while simultaneously learning the
unknown qualities of the agents. We first assume that the qualities are known

genus-one fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds. Such geometries appear in families that
are parameterized by the Tate-Shafarevich group of the genus-one fibration.
While the F-theory compactification on any element of this family gives rise to
the same physics, the corresponding M-theory compactifications on these
geometries differ and are obtained by a fluxed circle reduction of the former.
In this note, we focus on an element of order three in the Tate-Shafarevich
group of the general cubic. We discuss how the different M-theory vacua and the
associated discrete gauge groups can be obtained by Higgsing of a pair of
five-dimensional U(1) symmetries. The Higgs fields arise from vanishing cycles
in $I_2$-fibers that appear at certain codimension two loci in the base. We
explicitly identify all three curves that give rise to the corresponding Higgs
fields. In this analysis the investigation of different resolved phases of the
underlying geometry plays a crucial r\^ole.

statistically significant enhanced hard X-ray emission relative to the expected
galaxy-wide contribution from low-mass and high-mass XRBs, based on the L(2-10

the majority of these X-ray enhanced dwarf galaxies, the excess emission is
consistent with (but not necessarily due to) a nuclear X-ray source. Follow-up

`building blocks' of the magnetic solar atmosphere. However, it is the smallest
magnetic elements that have risen to the forefront of solar physics research in
recent years. Structures, which include magnetic bright points, are often at
the diffraction limit of even the largest of solar telescopes. Importantly, it
is the improvements in facilities, instrumentation, imaging techniques and

examine the motions, dynamics and evolution of such features on the smallest

them prone to the buffeting supplied by the ubiquitous surrounding convective
plasma motions. Here, it is believed that magnetohydrodynamic waves can be
induced, which propagate along the field lines, carrying energy upwards to the
outermost extremities of the solar corona. Such wave phenomena can exist in a
variety of guises, including fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes, in addition
to Alfven waves. Coupled with rapid advancements in magnetohydrodynamic wave

Gyrochronology relations have previously been calibrated using young clusters,

calibrated at late ages. We used rotation period measurements of 310 Kepler
stars with asteroseismic ages, 50 stars from the Hyades and Coma Berenices
clusters and 6 field stars (including the Sun) with precise age measurements to
calibrate the gyrochronology relation, whilst fully accounting for measurement
uncertainties in all observable quantities. We calibrated a relation of the
form $P=A^n\times(B-V-c)^b$, where $P$ is rotation period in days, $A$ is age
in Myr, $B$ and $V$ are magnitudes and $a$, $b$ and $n$ are the free parameters

explore the posterior probability distribution functions of the gyrochronology

sample, leading us to find that no single relation beween rotation period,
colour and age can adequately describe all the subsets of our data. The Kepler
asteroseismic stars, cluster stars and local field stars cannot all be
described by the same gyrochronology relation. The Kepler asteroseismic stars
may be subject to observational biases, however the clusters show unexpected
deviations from the predicted behaviour, providing concerns for the overall
reliability of gyrochronology as a dating method.

In this synthesis, the universe $U$ is treated as an isolated deterministic
dynamical system evolving precisely on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset
$I_U$ of its state space. A non-classical approach to the physics of $U$ is
developed by treating the geometry of $I_U$ as more primitive than dynamical
evolution equations on $I_U$. A specific symbolic representation of $I_U$ is
constructed which encodes quaternionic multiplication and from which the
statistical properties of complex Hilbert Space vectors are emergent. The
Hilbert Space itself arises as the singular limit of Invariant Set Theory as a
fractal parameter $N \rightarrow \infty$. Although the Hilbert Space of quantum
theory is counterfactually complete, the measure-zero set $I_U$ is
counterfactually incomplete, no matter how large is $N$. Such incompleteness
allows reinterpretations of familiar quantum phenomena, consistent with realism
and local causality. The non-computable nature of $I_U$ ensures that these
reinterpretations are neither conspiratorial nor retrocausal and, through a
homeomorphism with the ring of $2^N$-adic integers, are robust to noise and
hence not fine tuned. The non-commutativity of Hilbert Space observables
emerges from the symbolic representation of $I_U$ through the generic
number-theoretic incommensurateness of $\phi/\pi$ and $\cos \phi$. Invariant
Set Theory implies a much stronger synergy between cosmology and quantum
physics than exists in contemporary theory, suggesting a novel approach to
synthesising gravitational and quantum physics and providing new perspectives

  Aims. Our goal is to seek previously undetected structures using additional
techniques to reanalyse a data cube obtained with the GMOS-IFU installed on the
Gemini North telescope (Schnorr M\""uller et al. 2011).
  Method. We analysed the data cube using techniques of noise reduction,
spatial deconvolution, starlight subtraction, PCA tomography, and comparison
with HST images.
  Results. We identified a hot bubble with T $>$ 43500 K that is associated
with strong emission of [N II]$\lambda$5755\AA\ and a high [O
I]$\lambda$6300/H$\alpha$ ratio; the bubble displays a bluish continuum,
surrounded by a thin shell of H$\alpha$ + [N II] emission. We also reinterpret
the outflow found by Schnorr M\""uller et al. (2011) showing that the
blueshifted cone nearly coincides with the radio jet, as expected.
  Conclusions. We interpret the hot bubble as having been caused by post
starburst events that left one or more clusters of young stars, similar to the
ones found at the centre of the Milky Way, such as the Arches and the IRS 16
clusters. Shocked structures from combined young stellar winds or supernova
remnants are probably the cause of this hot gas and the low ionization

z~3.1 has produced a large number of candidate LyC-emitting galaxies. These
samples are contaminated by galaxies at lower redshift. To better understand
LyC escape, we need an uncontaminated sample of galaxies that emit strongly in
the LyC. Here we present deep Hubble imaging of five bright galaxies at z~3.1
that had previously been identified as candidate LyC-emitters with ground-based
images. The WFC3 F336W images probe the LyC of galaxies at z>3.06 and provide
an order-of-magnitude increase in spatial resolution over ground-based imaging.
The non-ionizing UV images often show multiple galaxies (or components) within
~1'' of the candidate LyC emission seen from the ground. In each case, only one
of the components is emitting light in the F336W filter, which would indicate
LyC escape if that component is at z>3.06. We use Keck/NIRSPEC near-IR
spectroscopy to measure redshifts of these components to distinguish
LyC-emitters from foreground contamination. We find that two candidates are low
redshift contaminants, one candidate had a previously misidentified redshift,
and the other two cannot be confirmed as LyC-emitters. The level of
contamination is consistent with previous estimates. For the galaxies with
z>3.06, we derive strong 1 sigma limits on the relative escape fraction between
0.07 and 0.09. We still do not have a sample of definitive LyC-emitters, and a
much larger study of low luminosity galaxies is required. The combination of
high resolution imaging and deep spectroscopy is critical for distinguishing
LyC-emitters from foreground contaminants.

of stellar elemental abundances offer information on the composition of those
planets, including smaller, rocky planets. In particular, the C/O ratio is
proposed to be a key determinant of the composition of solids that condense
from disk gas and are incorporated into planets. Also, planets may leave
chemical signatures on the photospheres of their host stars by sequestering
heavy elements, or by being accreted by the stars. The presence, absence, and
composition of planets could be revealed by small differences in the relative
abundances between stars. I critically examine these scenarios and show that
(i) a model of Galactic chemical evolution predicts that the C/O ratio is
expected to be close to the solar value and vary little between dwarf stars in
the solar neighborhood; (ii) spectroscopic surveys of M dwarf stars limit the
occurrence of stars with C/O $\gtrsim 1$ to $<10^{-3}$; and (iii) planetesimal
chemistry will be controlled by the composition of oxygen-rich dust inherited
from the molecular cloud and processed in a dust-rich environment, not a gas
with the stellar composition. A second generation of more reduced planetesimals
could be produced by re-equilibration of some material with dust-depleted gas.
Finally, I discuss how minor differences in relative abundances between stars

points and find that the effective Fermi velocity in very anisotropic and
depends on the energy gap. We show that the extra Dirac points obtained here
behave differently compared to previously studied systems.

correlation width of photon pairs in degenerate collinear SPDC. This width
defines the size of a biphoton birth zone, the region where the signal and
idler photons are likely to be found when conditioning on the position of the
destroyed pump photon. Along the way, we discuss the quantum-optical
calculation of the amplitude for the SPDC process, as well as its simplified
form for nearly collinear degenerate phase matching. Following this, we show
how this biphoton amplitude can be approximated with a Double-Gaussian
wavefunction, and give a brief discussion of the measurement statistics (and
subsequent convenience) of such Double-Gaussian wavefunctions. Next, we use
this approximation to get a simplified estimation of the transverse correlation
width, and compare it to more accurate calculations as well as experimental
results. We then conclude with a discussion of the concept of a biphoton birth
zone, using it to develop intuition for the tradeoff between the first-order
spatial coherence and bipohoton correlations in SPDC.

close analogy with finite-time future singularity which is associated to dark
energy era is described. Calling and classifying the singularities of such
inflation as finite-time cosmological singularities we investigate their
occurrence, with special emphasis on the Type IV singularity. The study is
performed in the context of a general non-canonical scalar-tensor theory. In
addition, the impact of finite time singularities on the slow-roll parameters
is also investigated. Particularly, we study three cases, in which the
singularity occurs during the inflationary era, at the end, and also we study
the case that the singularity occurs much more later than inflation ends. Using
the obtained slow-roll parameters, for each case, we calculate explicitly the
spectral index of primordial curvature perturbations $n_s$, the associated
running of the spectral index $a_s$ and of the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$ and
compare the resulting values to the Planck and BICEP2 data. As we demonstrate,
in some cases corresponding to the Type IV singularity, there might be the
possibility of agreement with the observational data, when the singularity
occurs at the end, or after inflation. However, absolute concordance of all
observational indices is not achieved. On the contrary, if the singularity
occurs during the inflationary era, this is catastrophic for the theory, since
the observational indices become divergent. We also show how a Type IV
singularity may be consistently accommodated in the Universe's late time
evolution.

makers not only have to identify the key textual information representing the
ideas, but they also need to consider online opinions of people who gave
comments and votes on the ideas. Due to the extremely large size of text data
generated by people on the Internet, identifying textual information has been
carried out in manual ways, and has been considered very time consuming and
costly. To overcome the ineffectiveness, this paper introduces a novel
framework that can help decision makers discover ideas having the potential to
be used in an NPD process. To achieve this, a semi-automatic text mining
technique that retrieves useful text patterns from ideas posted on
crowdsourcing application is proposed. Then, we provide an online learning
algorithm to evaluate whether the idea is potential or not. Finally to verify
the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted experiments on the data, which
are collected from an existing crowd sourcing website.

bipartite models as biclique proliferation. Whereas this sensitivity does not
reflect common interpretations of triadic closure in social networks, this
paper proposes a measure of triadic closure in affiliation networks designed to
control for it. To avoid arbitrariness, the paper introduces a triadic
framework for affiliation networks, within which a range of measures can be
defined; it then presents a set of basic axioms that suffice to narrow this
range to the one measure. An instrumental assessment compares the proposed and
two existing measures for reliability, validity, redundancy, and practicality.
All three measures then take part in an investigation of three empirical social

  Operators for Large Scale Data Processing",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we examine the problem of approximating a general linear
dimensionality reduction (LDR) operator, represented as a matrix $A \in
\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $m < n$, by a partial circulant matrix with rows
related by circular shifts. Partial circulant matrices admit fast
implementations via Fourier transform methods and subsampling operations; our
investigation here is motivated by a desire to leverage these potential
computational improvements in large-scale data processing tasks. We establish a
fundamental result, that most large LDR matrices (whose row spaces are
uniformly distributed) in fact cannot be well approximated by partial circulant
matrices. Then, we propose a natural generalization of the partial circulant
approximation framework that entails approximating the range space of a given
LDR operator $A$ over a restricted domain of inputs, using a matrix formed as a
product of a partial circulant matrix having $m '> m$ rows and a $m \times k$
'post processing' matrix. We introduce a novel algorithmic technique, based on
sparse matrix factorization, for identifying the factors comprising such
approximations, and provide preliminary evidence to demonstrate the potential
of this approach.

are abundant at high redshifts but exceedingly rare in the Universe today,
implying significant evolution such that their sizes at z ~ 2+/-0.6 have
increased by factors of 3 to 6 to become today's massive elliptical galaxies.
These claims have been based on studies which measured the half-light radii of
galaxies as though they are all single component systems. Here we identify 21
spheroidal stellar systems within 90 Mpc that have half-light, major-axis radii
R_e < ~2 kpc, stellar masses 0.7x10^{11} < M_*/M_Sun < 1.4x10^{11}, and Sersic
indices typically around a value of n=2 to 3. This abundance of compact,
massive spheroids in our own backyard - with a number density of 6.9x10^{-6} /
Mpc^3 (or 3.5x10^{-5} / Mpc^3 per unit dex in stellar mass) - and with the same
physical properties as the high-redshift galaxies, had been over-looked because
they are encased in stellar disks which usually result in `galaxy' sizes
notably larger than 2 kpc. Moreover, this number density is a lower limit
because it has not come from a volume-limited sample. The actual density may be
closer to 10^{-4} / Mpc^3, although further work is required to confirm this.
We therefore conclude that not all massive `spheroids' have undergone dramatic
structural and size evolution since z ~ 2+/-0.6. Given that the bulges of local
early-type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars which
existed at z ~ 2, it seems likely that some of the observed high redshift
spheroids did not increase in size by building (3D) triaxial envelopes as
commonly advocated, and that the growth of (2D) disks has also been important
over the past 9-11 billion years.

  We define a quantum version of Hamiltonian reduction by stages and use it to

A.This allows us to express the W-algebra U(g,e') as a subquotient of U(g,e)

(U(g,e),U(g,e'))-bimodules analogous to the generalised Gel'fand-Graev modules

adjoint functors between the corresponding module categories.
  The category of modules over a W-algebra has a full subcategory defined in a
parallel fashion to that of the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand (BGG) category O;
this version of category O(e) for W-algebras is equivalent to an infinitesimal
block of O by an argument of Mili\v{c}i\'{c} and Soergel. We therefore
construct analogues of the translation functors between the different blocks of

function $f(n)$ defined by a distributed update stream $f'(n)$. Existing
streaming algorithms with worst-case guarantees for this problem assume $f(n)$
to be monotone; there are very large lower bounds on the space requirements for
summarizing a distributed non-monotonic stream, often linear in the size $n$ of
the stream.
  Input streams that give rise to large space requirements are highly variable,
making relatively large jumps from one timestep to the next. However, streams
often vary slowly in practice. What has heretofore been lacking is a framework
for non-monotonic streams that admits algorithms whose worst-case performance
is as good as existing algorithms for monotone streams and degrades gracefully
for non-monotonic streams as those streams vary more quickly.
  In this paper we propose such a framework. We introduce a new stream
parameter, the ""variability"" $v$, deriving its definition in a way that shows
it to be a natural parameter to consider for non-monotonic streams. It is also
a useful parameter. From a theoretical perspective, we can adapt existing
algorithms for monotone streams to work for non-monotonic streams, with only
minor modifications, in such a way that they reduce to the monotone case when
the stream happens to be monotone, and in such a way that we can refine the
worst-case communication bounds from $\Theta(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(v)$. From a
practical perspective, we demonstrate that $v$ can be small in practice by
proving that $v$ is $O(\log f(n))$ for monotone streams and $o(n)$ for streams
that are ""nearly"" monotone or that are generated by random walks. We expect $v$
to be $o(n)$ for many other interesting input classes as well.

the dimension of the accessible and of the inaccessible subspaces of its

random pure state of $n+1$ qubits and we are asked to compute the largest
coherence that we can retrieve on one of them by optimally measuring a certain
number $0\leq a\leq n$ of the others. We find a surprising effect around the
value $a\approx n/2$: the recoverable coherence sharply transitions between 0
and 1, indicating that in order to restore full coherence on a qubit we need
access to only half of its physical environment (or in terms of degrees of

recoverable coherence becomes a typical property of the whole ensemble as $n$

Interacting Importance Sampler (MIIS). The MIIS sampler uses conditional
importance sampling (IS) approximations to jointly sample the current state of

incorporating a full range of variance reduction techniques. We compute
Rao-Blackwellized estimates based on the conditional expectations to construct
control variates for estimating expectations under the target distribution. The
control variates are particularly efficient when there are substantial
correlations between the variables in the target distribution, a challenging
setting for MCMC. An important motivating application of MIIS occurs when the
exact Gibbs sampler is not available because it is infeasible to directly
simulate from the conditional distributions. In this case the MIIS method can
be more efficient than a Metropolis-within-Gibbs approach. We also introduce
the MIIS random walk algorithm, designed to accelerate convergence and improve
upon the computational efficiency of standard random walk samplers. Simulated

significantly reduces the variance of Monte Carlo estimates compared to

histories, as indicated by the 4000AA-break (D4000), Hdelta absorption
(EW(Hd_A)) and Halpha emission (EW(Ha)) indices, can be useful for
understanding disk growth and star formation cessation in local galaxies. We
classify 12 galaxies observed on two P-MaNGA plates as either centrally
quiescent (CQ) or centrally star-forming (CSF), according to whether D4000
measured in the central spaxel of each datacube exceeds 1.6. For each galaxy we
generate both 2D maps and radial profiles of D4000, EW(Hd_A) and EW(Ha). We
find that CSF galaxies generally show very weak or no radial variation in these
diagnostics. In contrast, CQ galaxies present significant radial gradients, in
the sense that D4000 decreases, while both EW(Hd_A) and EW(Ha) increase from
the galactic center outward. The outer regions of the galaxies show greater
scatter on diagrams relating the three parameters than their central parts. In
particular, the clear separation between centrally-measured quiescent and
star-forming galaxies in these diagnostic planes is largely filled in by the
outer parts of galaxies whose global colors place them in the green valley,
supporting the idea that the green valley represents a transition between
blue-cloud and red-sequence phases, at least in our small sample. These results
are consistent with a picture in which the cessation of star formation
propagates from the center of a galaxy outwards as it moves to the red
sequence.

Proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that flows in minimal-span channels
are sufficient for capturing the downward velocity shift, that is, the Hama
roughness function, predicted by flows in full-span channels. We consider two
sets of simulations, first with modelled roughness imposed by body forces, and
second with explicit roughness described by roughness-conforming grids. Owing
to the minimal cost, we are able to conduct DNSs with increasing roughness
Reynolds numbers while maintaining a fixed blockage ratio, as is typical in
full-scale applications. The present method promises a practical, fast and
accurate tool for characterising hydraulic resistance directly from
profilometry data of rough surfaces.

combining high-density single-molecule imaging and statistical inference to
separately map the diffusion and energy landscapes of membrane proteins across

When applying these analytical tools to glycine neurotransmitter receptors
(GlyRs) at inhibitory synapses, we find that gephyrin scaffolds act as shallow
energy traps (~3 kBT) for GlyRs, with a depth modulated by the biochemical
properties of the receptor-gephyrin interaction loop. In turn, the inferred
maps can be used to simulate the dynamics of proteins in the membrane, from the
level of individual receptors to that of the population, and thereby, to model
the stochastic fluctuations of physiological parameters (such as the number of
receptors at synapses). Overall, our approach provides a powerful and
comprehensive framework with which to analyze biochemical interactions in
living cells and to decipher the multi-scale dynamics of biomolecules in

10543) of M82 X-1, we split M82 X-1 into two sources separated by 1.1$\arcsec$.
The secondary source is not detected in other M82 observations. The radio flare
source is found to associate not with M82 X-1, but with the nearby transient
source S1 with an outburst luminosity of $\sim 10^{39} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. With
X-ray outburst and radio flare activities analogous to the recently discovered
micro-quasar in M31, S1 is likely to be a micro-quasar hidden in the shadow of
M82 X-1.

a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and

(iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given

264.78A/274.20A.Since coronal line profiles of the outflow region are composed
of a major component with a Doppler shift of < 10 km s^-1 and a minor component
(enhanced blue wing: EBW) blueshifted by up to 100 km s^-1, we extracted EBW
from the line profiles through double-Gaussian fitting. We tried applying the
simultaneous fitting to those two Fe xiv lines with several physical
restrictions. Electron density for both components (n_Major and n_EBW,
respectively) was calculated by referring to the theoretical intensity ratio as
a function of electron density as per the CHIANTI database. We studied six
locations in the outflow regions around NOAA AR10978. The average electron
density was n_Major = 10^(9.16 +- 0.16) cm^-3 and n_EBW = 10^(8.74 +- 0.29)
cm^-3. The magnitude relationship between n_Major and n_EBW was opposite in the
eastern and western outflow regions. The column depth was also calculated for
each component, which leads to the result that the outflows possess only a
small fraction (~ 0.1) in the eastern region, while they dominate over the
major component in the line profiles by a factor of five in the western region.
When taking into account the extending coronal structures, the western region
can be thought to represent the mass leakage. In contrast, we suggest a
possibility that the eastern region actually contributes to the mass supply to
coronal loops.

thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic

fluctuations near the native state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding.
The level of stability correlates with the average coordination number for
amino acids contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern
of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is
different than in the open conformation, including within the active site. The

before the interaction ('stochastic' phase), during the `merger' proper,
lasting ~0.2-0.3 Gyr, and in the `remnant' phase. We calculate the bi-variate
distribution of SFR and BHAR and define the regions in the SFR-BHAR plane that
the three phases occupy. No strong correlation between BHAR and galaxy-wide SFR
is found. A possible exception are galaxies with the highest SFR and the
highest BHAR. We also bin the data in the same way used in several
observational studies, by either measuring the mean SFR for AGN in different
luminosity bins, or the mean BHAR for galaxies in bins of SFR. We find that the
apparent contradiction or SFR versus BHAR for observed samples of AGN and star
forming galaxies is actually caused by binning effects. The two types of
samples use different projections of the full bi-variate distribution, and the
full information would lead to unambiguous interpretation. We also find that a

destructor that parasitizes honey bees is among the main threats to colony
health. Although this mite is unlikely to, by itself, cause the collapse of
hives, it plays an important role as it is a vector for many viral diseases.
Such diseases are among the likely causes for Colony Collapse Disorder.
  The effects of V. destructor infestation are disparate in different parts of
the world. Greater morbidity - in the form of colony losses - has been reported
in colonies of European honey bees (EHB) in Europe, Asia and North America.
However, this mite has been present in Brasil for many years and yet there are
no reports of Africanized honey bee (AHB) colonies losses.
  Studies carried out in Mexico showed that some resistance behaviors to the
mite - especially grooming and hygienic behavior - appear to be different in
each subspecies. Could those difference in behaviors explain why the AHB are
less susceptible to Colony Collapse Disorder?
  In order to answer this question, we propose a mathematical model of the

arising out of the exchange of the up, down and strange quarks. This aspect of
$SU(3)$ symmetry is used extensively to relate many decay modes of heavy

$SU(2)$ symmetries (subsumed in $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry): isospin (or
$T$-spin), $U$-spin and $V$-spin, using the Dalitz plots of some three-body
meson decays. We look at the Dalitz plot distributions of decays in which pairs
of the final three particles are related by two distinct $SU(2)$ symmetries. We
show that such decay modes have characteristic distributions that enable the
measurement of violation of each of the three $SU(2)$ symmetries via Dalitz
plot asymmetries in a single decay mode. Experimental estimates of these easily
measurable asymmetries would help in better understanding the weak decays of
heavy mesons into both two and three light mesons.

the elevated temperature can melt the ice on the body even without significant

moons such as Europa or Enceladus, where the surface ice layer covers tidally
heated water ocean. Tidal forces may be even stronger in extrasolar systems,
depending on the properties of the moon and its orbit. For studying the tidally
heated surface temperature of exomoons, we used a viscoelastic model for the
first time. This model is more realistic than the widely used, so-called fixed
Q models, because it takes into account the temperature dependency of the tidal
heat flux, and the melting of the inner material. With the use of this model we
introduced the circumplanetary Tidal Temperate Zone (TTZ), that strongly
depends on the orbital period of the moon, and less on its radius. We compared
the results with the fixed Q model and investigated the statistical volume of
the TTZ using both models. We have found that the viscoelastic model predicts
2.8 times more exomoons in the TTZ with orbital periods between 0.1 and 3.5
days than the fixed Q model for plausible distributions of physical and orbital
parameters. The viscoelastic model gives more promising results in terms of
habitability, because the inner melting of the body moderates the surface
temperature, acting like a thermostat.

and low-mass planets have been presented. In parallel, detailed chemical
abundance studies have reported different trends between samples of planet and
non-planet hosts. We determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity, and
abundances of a sample of 251 stars including stars with known debris discs,
with debris discs and planets, and only with planets. Stars with debris discs
and planets have the same [Fe/H] behaviour as stars hosting planets, and they
also show a similar <[X/Fe]>-Tc trend. Different behaviour in the <[X/Fe]>-Tc
trend is found between the samples of stars without planets and the samples of
planet hosts. In particular, when considering only refractory elements,
negative slopes are shown in cool giant planet hosts, whilst positive ones are
shown in stars hosting low-mass planets. Stars hosting exclusively close-in
giant planets show higher metallicities and positive <[X/Fe]>-Tc slope. A
search for correlations between the <[X/Fe]>-Tc slopes and the stellar
properties reveals a moderate but significant correlation with the stellar
radius and as well as a weak correlation with the stellar age. The fact that
stars with debris discs and stars with low-mass planets do not show neither
metal enhancement nor a different <[X/Fe]>-Tc trend might indicate a
correlation between the presence of debris discs and the presence of low-mass
planets. We extend results from previous works which reported differences in
the <[X/Fe]>-Tc trends between planet hosts and non hosts. However, these
differences tend to be present only when the star hosts a cool distant planet
and not in stars hosting exclusively low-mass planets.

phase transitions that could happen at the early stages of the Universe
evolution and could be realized in heavy-ion or hadron-hadron collisions.
Microscopic description of phase transitions is notoriously difficult because
of the absence of small parameters. Here we present a general approach allowing
to treat situations, when there are no small parameters. The approach is based
on optimized perturbation theory and self-similar approximation theory. It
allows, starting with divergent perturbation series in powers of an
asymptotically small parameter, to construct expressions extrapolating
asymptotic series to arbitrary values of the parameter, including its infinite
limit. Examples of such approximants are: right root approximants, left root
approximants, continued root approximants, exponential approximants, and factor
approximants. The approach is illustrated by the phase transition of gauge
symmetry breaking in a multicomponent field theory. The found critical indices
are in very good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations as well as with
complicated methods of Pade-Borel summation, while our approach is much
simpler. The nice feature of the approach is that it gives exact values for the
cases where exact solutions are known.

stability of equilibria, for kinetic systems given in the form of polynomial
ODEs. Such models are commonly used to describe the dynamics of nonnegative
systems, with a wide range of application fields such as chemistry, systems
biology, process modeling or even transportation systems. Using a flux-based
description of kinetic models, a canonical representation of the set of all
possible feasible equilibria is developed. The characterization is made in
terms of strictly stable compartmental matrices to define the so-called family
of solutions. Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are linear
on a log-transformed space of complexes, and relate to the kernel of a matrix,
the columns of which span the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly
interesting representation of these constraints can be expressed in terms of a
class of monotonous decreasing functions. This allows connections to be
established with classical results in CRNT that relate to the existence and
uniqueness of equilibria along positive stoichiometric compatibility classes.
In particular, monotonicity can be employed to identify regions in the set of
possible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing, and to
conclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks.
The latter result might support constructing an alternative proof of the
well-known deficiency one theorem. The developed notions and results are
illustrated through examples.

  In this paper, we present local linearizability, a relaxed consistency
condition that is applicable to container-type concurrent data structures like
pools, queues, and stacks. While linearizability requires that the effect of
each operation is observed by all threads at the same time, local
linearizability only requires that for each thread T, the effects of its local
insertion operations and the effects of those removal operations that remove
values inserted by T are observed by all threads at the same time. We
investigate theoretical and practical properties of local linearizability and
its relationship to many existing consistency conditions. We present a generic

show performance and scalability improvements over the original building blocks

Quasars may not be adequate when it relies solely on the equivalent widths
(EWs) of optical lines. In fact, depending on redshift, some strong emission
lines can fall in the infrared window and be missed. We selected a sample of BL
Lacs with firm redshift identification and good visibility from Paranal. We
targeted with the X-shooter spectrograph the five BL Lacs with z > 0.7, i.e.,
those for which the Halpha line, one of the strongest among blazars, falls
outside the optical window and determined the EW of emission lines in both the
infrared and optical bands. Two out of five sources show an observed Halpha EW
> 5A (one has rest frame EW > 5A) and could be classified as FSRQs by one of
the classification schemes used in the literature. A third object is
border-line with an observed EW of 4.4 +/- 0.5A. In all these cases Halpha is
the strongest emission line detected. The Halpha line of the other two blazars
is not detected, but in one case it falls in a region strongly contaminated by
sky lines and in the other one the spectrum is featureless. We conclude that a
blazar classification based on EW width only can be inaccurate and may lead to
an erroneous determination of blazar evolution. This effect is more severe for
the BL Lac class, since FSRQs can be misclassified as BL Lacs especially at
high redshifts (z > 0.7), where the latter are extremely rare.

Correspondingly a voltage pulse is generated at the extremes of the junction.
Under periodic driving this allows us to produce a comb-like voltage pulses
sequence. In the frequency domain it is possible to generate up to hundreds of
harmonics of the fundamental driving frequency, thus mimicking the frequency
comb used in optics and metrology. We discuss several implementations through a
rectangular, cylindrical and annular junction geometries, allowing us to

precise symmetry of the order parameter as well its evolution with doping
remains highly controversial. There is no general consensus on the nature of
pairing in iron-based superconductors leaving the perspectives ranging from
$s^{++}$ wave, to $s^{\pm}$, and $d$ wave. Here we show that doping induced a
sudden change of the pairing symmetry from the $s^{++}$- to $d$-wave in the
BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$As$_{2}$ system with an $s^{\pm}$ state near the crossover
boundary at $x=0.15$. The presence of the $s^{\pm}$ state is of particular
scientific interest because an intermediate phase breaks the pairing symmetry
when the $s$- and $d$-wave phases come together to interfere. For $x <$ 0.15,
the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth, lower critical
field, and specific heat in the superconducting (SC) state provides strong
evidence for a two-band $s$-wave order parameter. Upon doping for $x >$ 0.15,
we find the temperature and magnetic-field contributions to the specific heat
in $T^{2}$ and $\sqrt{H}$, respectively, indicating line nodes in the SC gap.
These findings thus clarify the symmetry nature as well as the evolution of the

space-time formulation using discontinuous piecewise linear elements in time
and continuous piecewise linear elements in space on a fixed background mesh.
The domain is represented using a piecewise linear level set function on the
background mesh and a cut finite element method is used to discretize the bulk
and surface problems. In the cut finite element method the bilinear forms
associated with the weak formulation of the problem are directly evaluated on
the bulk domain and the surface defined by the level set, essentially using the
restrictions of the piecewise linear functions to the computational domain. In
addition a stabilization term is added to stabilize convection as well as the
resulting algebraic system that is solved in each time step. We show in
numerical examples that the resulting method is accurate and stable and results
in well conditioned algebraic systems independent of the position of the
interface relative to the background mesh.

using the single band effective-mass approximation . In our calculations we
consider the discontinuity of the effective mass of the electron in each of the

wells. The expected overall trend is a decrease of ICD lifetime with a decrease
in the distance between the wells. We show that the distance can be tuned such
that the emitted ICD electron is trapped in a meta-stable state in the
continuum i.e. a one electron resonance state. This causes the life time of the
ICD to be an order of magnitude smaller even in very long distances, and
improves the efficiency of the ICD. For the ICD to be dominant decay mechanism
it must prevail over all other possible competitive decay processes. We have
found that the lifetime of the ICD is on the timescale of picoseconds.
Therefore, based on our results we can design an experiment that will observe
the ICD phenomenon in QWs nano-structure for the first time. This work can lead
to designing a wavelength sensitive detector which is efficient even in low

formula for the correlation functions contained in a paper by Adler, van
Moerbeke and Wang to analyse the global density (which we also analyse by
studying characteristic polynomials), and the hard edge scaled correlation
functions. For the global density functional equations for the corresponding

transformations to the larger family of transformations in the fcc-bcc-hcp
system and to fcc-fcc mechanical twinning. The analytical expressions of the
atomic displacements and lattice distortions are calculated directly from the
orientation relationships without any adjustment of free parameter; the unique
assumption is that the atoms are hard-spheres that cannot interpenetrate
themselves. The habit planes are predicted on the simple criterion that they
are unrotated by the distortion, and the results are compared to experimental
observations published in literature. It is shown that shuffle is required for
transformations implying the hcp phase because the hcp primitive Bravais
lattice contains two atoms, instead of one for the fcc and bcc phases. A simple
encoding of the lattice distortions and shuffles permits to attribute a
groupoid structure to the transformations in the fcc-hcp-bcc system. The
analytical expressions of the intermediate states are given and could be used
to calculate activation energies. The martensitic distortion occurs in
one-step, without shearing, and its accommodation generates orientation
gradients in the parent phase, independently of its glide modes. The concept of
reversibility is detailed on the basis of crystallographic and morphological
arguments. The possibility to apply this approach to diffusion-limited
martensitic transformations is discussed.

comparable clusters that can be obtained. We used first some purely synthetic
random data sets to assess our formal similarity-comparability mixing model. We
then propose two variants of the comparability measure that has been defined by

it to clustering or categorizing tasks. These two variant measures are
subsequently used to evaluate our similarity-comparability mixing model in the

sets collected from Wikipedia categories for the English and French languages.
Our experiments show clear improvements in clustering and classification
accuracies when mixing comparability with similarity measures, with, as
expected, a higher robustness obtained when the two comparability variant
measures that we propose are used. We believe that this approach is
particularly well suited for the construction of thematic comparable corpora of

social and algorithmic filtering may cause exposure to less diverse points of
view, and even foster polarization and misinformation. Here we explore and
validate this hypothesis quantitatively for the first time, at the collective
and individual levels, by mining three massive datasets of web traffic, search
logs, and Twitter posts. Our analysis shows that collectively, people access
information from a significantly narrower spectrum of sources through social
media and email, compared to search. The significance of this finding for
individual exposure is revealed by investigating the relationship between the
diversity of information sources experienced by users at the collective and
individual level. There is a strong correlation between collective and
individual diversity, supporting the notion that when we use social media we
find ourselves inside ""social bubbles"". Our results could lead to a deeper
understanding of how technology biases our exposure to new information.

NUMA regions inside a single server in the small and multiple servers in the

slow down distributed query processing to such an extent that a cluster of
machines actually performed worse than a single many-core server. The increased
main-memory capacity of the cluster remained the sole benefit of such a
scale-out.
  The economic viability of high-speed interconnects such as InfiniBand has
narrowed this performance gap considerably. However, InfiniBand's higher
network bandwidth alone does not improve query performance as expected when the
distributed query engine is left unchanged. The scalability of distributed
query processing is impaired by TCP overheads, switch contention due to
uncoordinated communication, and load imbalances resulting from the
inflexibility of the classic exchange operator model. This paper presents the
blueprint for a distributed query engine that addresses these problems by
considering both levels of networks holistically. It consists of two parts:
First, hybrid parallelism that distinguishes local and distributed parallelism
for better scalability in both the number of cores as well as servers. Second,
a novel communication multiplexer tailored for analytical database workloads
using remote direct memory access (RDMA) and low-latency network scheduling for
high-speed communication with almost no CPU overhead. An extensive evaluation
within the HyPer database system using the TPC-H benchmark shows that our
holistic approach indeed enables high-speed query processing over high-speed

observed in the Fermi-LAT data. This signal can be interpreted as resulting
from WIMP annihilation, with the spectrum well-fit by dark matter annihilating
dominantly into either bottom-quark or Higgs pairs. Supersymmetric models
provide a well-motivated framework to study the implications of this signal in
these channels. With a neutralino dark matter candidate, the gamma-ray excess
cannot be easily accommodated in the minimal supersymmetric model, which in any
case requires tuning below the percent level to explain the observed Higgs
mass. Instead we are naturally led to consider the next-to-minimal model with a
singlet superfield. This not only allows for the annihilation channel into
bottom-quark pairs to be implemented, but also provides new possibilities for
annihilation into Higgs-pseudoscalar pairs. We show that the fit to the
gamma-ray excess for the Higgs-pseudoscalar channel can be just as good as for
annihilation into bottom-quark pairs. Moreover, in the parameter range of
interest, the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model solves the mu-problem and
can explain the 125 GeV Higgs mass with improved naturalness. We also consider
an extension by adding a right-handed neutrino superfield with the right-handed
sneutrino acting as a dark matter candidate. Interestingly, this allows for the
annihilation into pseudoscalar pairs which also provide a good fit to the
gamma-ray excess. Furthermore, in the case of a neutralino LSP, the late decay
of a sneutrino NLSP can non-thermally produce the observed relic abundance.
Finally, the WIMP annihilation into scalar pairs allows for the possibility of
detecting the Higgs or pseudoscalar decay into two photons, providing a
smoking-gun signal of the model.

decouple the differential equations describing the $\beta$-functions and find
out if whether they are positive or not. For a set of parameters describing a

nonnegative or, otherwise, their scale dependence to be weak enough. These
conditions rely on the fact that asymptotically-free parameters can leave high
imprints of LV at low energies, which are ruled out by observations. Besides
imposing some constrains on the coefficients that describe LV, this method can
be used to extract irrelevant coefficients with no scale dependence.

is said to be contaminated according to the inflated variance model if it has a

small probability of coming from a contaminating distribution that has the same

presence of data contamination, the ordinary sample mean looses many of its
good properties, making it preferable to use more robust estimators. From a
didactical point of view, it is insightful to see to what extent an intuitive
estimator such as the sample mean becomes less favorable in a contaminated
setting. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions the sample mean,
based on a finite number of independent observations of $F$ which are
contaminated according to the inflated variance model, is a valid estimator for
the mean of $F$. In particular, we examine to what extent this estimator is
weakly consistent for the mean of $F$ and asymptotically normal. As classical
central limit theory is generally inaccurate to cope with the asymptotic
normality in this setting, we invoke more general approximate central limit

the single-electron time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) using a
velocity-gauge method [New J. Phys. 15, 013006 (2013)] that is numerically
stable as the laser intensity and number of energy bands are increased. The
resulting harmonic spectrum exhibits a primary plateau due to the coupling of
the valence band to the first conduction band, with a cutoff energy that scales
linearly with field strength and laser wavelength. We also find a weaker second
plateau due to coupling to higher-lying conduction bands, with a cutoff that is
also approximately linear in the field strength. To facilitate the analysis of
the time-frequency characteristics of the emitted harmonics, we also solve the
TDSE in a time-dependent basis set, the Houston states [Phys. Rev. B 33, 5494
(1986)], which allows us to separate inter-band and intra-band contributions to
the time-dependent current. We find that the inter-band and intra-band
contributions display very different time-frequency characteristics. We show
that solutions in these two bases are equivalent under an unitary
transformation but that, unlike the velocity gauge method, the Houston state
treatment is numerically unstable when more than a few low lying energy bands
are used.

the star is not close enough to the black hole to be totally disrupted and a
less dramatic event might happen. If the stellar orbit is bound and highly
eccentric, just like some stars in the centre of our own Galaxy, repeated
flares should occur. When the star approaches the black hole tidal radius at
periastron, matter might be stripped resulting in lower intensity outbursts
recurring once every orbital period. We report on Swift observations of a
recent bright flare from the galaxy IC 3599 hosting a middle-weight black hole,
where a possible tidal disruption event was observed in the early 1990s. By
light curve modelling and spectral fitting we can consistently account for the

low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Tidal stripping from this star over
several orbital passages might be able to spoon-feed also this activity.

Lewin and Sabin study in [M. Lewin, J. Sabin, {\it A Family of Monotone Quantum

relative entropy defined by $\mathcal{H}(A,B)=\text{Tr} [ \varphi(A) -
\varphi(B) - \varphi'(B)(A-B) ]$. Amongst other things, they prove that the
so-defined quantity is monotone if and only if $\varphi'$ is operator monotone.
The monotonicity is then used to properly define $\mathcal{H}(A,B)$ for
self-adjoint bounded operators acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
by a limiting procedure. More precisely, for an increasing sequence of
finite-dimensional projections $\lbrace P_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with $P_n
\to 1$ strongly, the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{H}(P_n A P_n, P_n B
P_n)$ is shown to exist and to be independent of the sequence of projections
$\lbrace P_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$. The question whether this sequence
converges to its ""obvious"" limit, namely $\text{Tr} [ \varphi(A)- \varphi(B) -
\varphi'(B)(A-B) ]$, has been left open. We answer this question in principle
affirmatively and show that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{H}(P_n A P_n, P_n B
P_n) = \text{Tr}[ \varphi(A) - \varphi(B) - \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} \alpha}

$B$ are regular enough, that is $(A-B)$, $\varphi(A)-\varphi(B)$ and
$\varphi'(B)(A-B)$ are trace-class, the identity $\text{Tr}[ \varphi(A) -
\varphi(B) - \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} \alpha} \varphi( \alpha A + (1-\alpha)B

holds.

recent years, most existing works combined multiple video features using simple
fusion strategies and neglected the utilization of inter-class semantic
relationships. This paper proposes a novel unified framework that jointly
exploits the feature relationships and the class relationships for improved
categorization performance. Specifically, these two types of relationships are
estimated and utilized by rigorously imposing regularizations in the learning
process of a deep neural network (DNN). Such a regularized DNN (rDNN) can be
efficiently realized using a GPU-based implementation with an affordable
training cost. Through arming the DNN with better capability of harnessing both
the feature and the class relationships, the proposed rDNN is more suitable for
modeling video semantics. With extensive experimental evaluations, we show that
rDNN produces superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches. On
the well-known Hollywood2 and Columbia Consumer Video benchmarks, we obtain
very competitive results: 66.9\% and 73.5\% respectively in terms of mean
average precision. In addition, to substantially evaluate our rDNN and
stimulate future research on large scale video categorization, we collect and
release a new benchmark dataset, called FCVID, which contains 91,223 Internet

Sun are believed to contribute to the energy budget of the upper layers of the
Sun's atmosphere, as they are observed to support a large number of MHD modes.
In recent years, kink waves in magnetic elements were observed at different
heights in the solar atmosphere, from the photosphere to the corona. However,
the propagation of these waves has not been fully evaluated. Our aim is to
investigate the propagation of kink waves in small magnetic elements in the
solar atmosphere. We analysed spectropolarimetric data of high-quality and long
duration of a photospheric quiet Sun region observed near the disk center with
the spectropolarimeter CRISP at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST), and
complemented by simultaneous and co-spatial broad-band chromospheric
observations of the same region. Our findings reveal a clear upward propagation
of kink waves with frequency above $~2.6$ mHz. Moreover, the signature of a
non-linear propagation process is also observed. By comparing photospheric to
chromospheric power spectra, no signature of an energy dissipation is found at
least at the atmospheric heights at which the data analysed originate. This
implies that most of the energy carried by the kink waves (within the frequency
range under study $< 17$ mHz) flows to upper layers in the Sun's atmosphere.

pre-perihelion to its perihelion at 1.4 AU. From our observations, we estimate
that the water production rate during closest approach to Mars was 1.5 +/- 0.3

that in total between 3.1-5.4 x 1E4 kg cometary gas was delivered to the

pre-perihelion activity of comet Siding Spring. The sudden increase of its
water production between 2.46-2.06 AU suggests the onset of the sublimation of
icy grains in the coma, likely driven by CO2. As the comet got closer to the
Sun, the relative contribution of the nucleus' water production increased,
while CO2 production rates decreased. The changes in the comet's activity can
be explained by a depletion of CO2, but the comet's high mass loss rate
suggests they may also reflect primordial heterogeneities in the nucleus.

redshifts z>6, is limited primarily by foreground emission. We investigate the
signatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the
delay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object
locations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate
interferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including
the largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.
These wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes
impact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most
desirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a
dipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array
observations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the
largest impact on the HI signal arise from power received far away from the
primary field of view. We identify diffuse emission near the horizon as a
significant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usually
represent structures on small scales. For signals entering through the primary
field of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. These
two mechanisms imprint a characteristic ""pitchfork"" signature on the
""foreground wedge"" in Fourier delay space. Based on these results, we propose
that selective down-weighting of data based on antenna spacing and time can
mitigate foreground contamination substantially by a factor ~100 with
negligible loss of sensitivity.

we calculate the low-redshift expansion for $H(z)$ and $\frac{\delta H}{H}$ for
an observer at the center of a spherically symmetric matter distribution in
presence of a cosmological constant. We then test the accuracy of the formulae
comparing them with fully relativistic non perturbative numerical calculations
for different cases for the density profile. The low red-shift expansion we
obtain gives results more precise than perturbation theory since is based on
the use of an exact solution of Einstein's field equations. For larger density
contrasts the low red-shift formulae accuracy improves respect to the
perturbation theory accuracy because the latter is based on the assumption of a
small density contrast, while the former does not rely on such assumption.
  The formulae can be used to take into account the effects on the Hubble
expansion parameter due to the monopole component of the local structure. If
the $H(z)$ observations will show deviations from the $\Lambda CDM$ prediction
compatible with the formulae we have derived, this could be considered an
independent evidence of the existence of a local inhomogeneity, and the
formulae could be used to determine the characteristics of this local

  transcriptional interference and regulation of gene expression","6+ pages, including 4 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.AO q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RNA polymerase (RNAP) is molecular machine that polymerizes a RNA molecule, a
linear heteropolymer, using a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as the corresponding
template; the sequence of monomers of the RNA is dictated by that of monomers
on the ssDNA template. While polymerizing a RNA, the RNAP walks step-by-step on
the ssDNA template in a specific direction. Thus, a RNAP can be regarded also
as a molecular motor and the sites of start and stop of its walk on the DNA
mark the two ends of the genetic message that it transcribes into RNA.
Interference of transcription of two overlapping genes is believed to regulate
the levels of their expression, i.e., the overall rate of the corresponding RNA
synthesis, through suppressive effect of one on the other. Here we model this
process as a mixed traffic of two groups of RNAP motors that are characterized
by two distinct pairs of start and stop sites. Each group polymerizes identical
copies of a RNA while the RNAs polymerized by the two groups are different.
These models, which may also be viewed as two interfering totally asymmetric
simple exclusion processes, account for all modes of transcriptional
interference in spite of their extreme simplicity. A combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation of these models demonstrate the physical origin
of the switch-like regulation of the two interfering genes in both
co-directional and contra-directional traffic of the two groups of RNAP motors.

success of an advert is measured based on how users interact with it. In this
paper we investigate whether the application of unsupervised learning and
association rule mining could be used to enable personalised targeting of
mobile adverts with the aim of increasing the interaction rate. Over May and
June 2014 we recorded advert interactions such as tapping the advert or
watching the whole advert video along with the set of apps a user has installed
at the time of the interaction. Based on the apps that the users have installed
we applied k-means clustering to profile the users into one of ten classes. Due
to the large number of apps considered we implemented dimension reduction to
reduced the app feature space by mapping the apps to their iTunes category and
clustered users based on the percentage of their apps that correspond to each
iTunes app category. The clustering was externally validated by investigating
differences between the way the ten profiles interact with the various adverts
genres (lifestyle, finance and entertainment adverts). In addition association
rule mining was performed to find whether the time of the day that the advert
is served and the number of apps a user has installed makes certain profiles
more likely to interact with the advert genres. The results showed there were
clear differences in the way the profiles interact with the different advert
genres and the results of this paper suggest that mobile advert targeting would
improve the frequency that users interact with an advert.

determinism and predictability of the underlying dynamics are evaluated with
methods of nonlinear time series analysis. We included original records from
the Draupner platform in the North Sea as well as time series from two optical
systems in our analysis. One of the latter was measured in the infrared tail of
optical fiber supercontinua, the other in the fluence profiles of
multifilaments. All three data sets exhibit extreme-value statistics and exceed
the significant wave height in the respective system by a factor larger than
two. Nonlinear time series analysis indicates a different degree of determinism
in the systems. The optical fiber scenario is found to be driven by quantum
noise whereas rogue waves emerge as a consequence of turbulence in the others.
With the large number of rogue events observed in the multifilament system, we
can systematically explore the predictability of such events in a turbulent
system. We observe that rogue events do not necessarily appear without a
warning, but are often preceded by a short phase of relative order. This
surprising finding sheds some new light on the fascinating phenomenon of rogue
waves.

clusters even when the central cooling time is short, implying that cooling
triggers a feedback loop that maintains thermal balance. Furthermore, cores
with short cooling times tend to have multiphase structure, suggesting that the
intracluster medium (ICM) becomes locally thermally unstable for cooling times
< 1 Gyr. In this work, we use 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the
onset of condensation in idealized galaxy-cluster cores. In particular, we look
at how the condensation process depends on the ratio of cooling time to
freefall time and on the geometry of the gravitational potential. We conclude
that the ICM can always evolve to a state in which condensation occurs if given
enough time, but that an initial timescale ratio tcool /tff < 10 is needed for
thermal instability to grow quickly enough to affect realistic cluster cores
within a timescale that is relevant for cosmological structure formation. We
find that instability leads to convection and that perturbations continue to
grow while the gas convects. Condensation occurs when the timescale ratio in
the low-entropy tail of the perturbation distribution drops below tcool /tff <
3, even if the volume-averaged timescale ratio is substantially greater. In our
simulations, the geometry of the gravitational potential does not have a strong
effect on thermal stability. Finally, we find that if condensation is powering
feedback, a conversion efficiency of around 10^-3 for converting the condensed
mass into thermal energy is sufficient to maintain thermal balance in the ICM.
