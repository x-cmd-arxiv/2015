other two relate to a closer examination of the issue of the representability
of real functions by their Fourier coefficients. As was shown in the previous
paper, in many cases one can recover the real function from its Fourier
coefficients even if the corresponding Fourier series diverges almost
everywhere. In such cases we say that the real function is still representable
by its Fourier coefficients. Here we establish a very weak condition on the
Fourier coefficients that ensures the representability of the function by those
coefficients. In addition to this, we show that any real function that is
absolutely integrable can be recovered almost everywhere from, and hence is
representable by, its Fourier coefficients, regardless of whether or not its
Fourier series converges. Interestingly, this also provides proof for a
conjecture proposed in the previous paper.

those observed by Buldyrev {\it et al.} in interdependent networks, which we
re-interpret as multiplex networks with agents that can only survive if they
mutually support each other, and whose survival struggle we map onto an SOS
type growth model. This mapping not only reveals non-trivial structures in the
phase space of the model, but also leads to a new and extremely efficient
simulation algorithm. We use this algorithm to study interdependent agents on
duplex Erd\""os-R\'enyi (ER) networks and on lattices with dimensions 2, 3, 4,

statements in the literature for ER networks and for 2-d lattices. In
particular, we find that $d=4$ is the upper critical dimension, that the
percolation transition is continuous for $d\leq 4$ but -- at least for $d\neq
3$ -- not in the universality class of ordinary percolation. For ER networks we
verify that the cluster statistics is exactly described by mean field theory,
but find evidence that the cascade process is not. For $d=5$ we find a first
order transition as for ER networks, but we find also that small clusters have
a nontrivial mass distribution that scales at the transition point. Finally,
for $d=2$ with intermediate range dependency links we propose a scenario
different from that proposed in W. Li {\it et al.}, PRL {\bf 108}, 228702

combine the parallelization with some well known techniques in the context of

different concurring mechanisms: gravitino-pair production with an extra jet,
associated gravitino production with a squark or a gluino, or squark/gluino

the proposed matrix exponential learning (MXL) algorithm converges to the

properties even in the presence of user update asynchronicities, random delays
and/or ergodically changing channel conditions. In particular, by properly
tuning the algorithm's learning rate (or step size), the algorithm converges
within a few iterations, even for large numbers of users and/or antennas per

that it is a remnant of quantum gravitational effects on known fields. We
arrive at this possibility in an indirect and surprising manner: by considering
retarded, nonlocal, and Lorentzian evolution for quantum fields. This is
inspired by recent developments in causal set theory, where such an evolution
shows up as the continuum limit of scalar field propagation on a background
causal set. Concretely, we study the quantum theory of a massless scalar field
whose evolution is given not by the the d'Alembertian $\Box$, but by an
operator $\tilde \Box$ which is Lorentz invariant, reduces to $\Box$ at low
energies, and defines an explicitly retarded evolution: $(\tilde \Box \phi)(x)$
only depends on $\phi(y)$, with $y$ is in the causal past of $x$. This
modification results in the existence of a continuum of massive particles, in
addition to the usual massless ones, in the free theory. When interactions are
introduced, these massive or off-shell quanta can be produced by the scattering
of massless particles, but once produced, they no longer interact, which makes
them a natural candidate for dark matter.

infer a kinematic model incorporating rigid, prismatic and revolute joints,
then use the model to predict the object's motion from a novel vantage point.

weakest couplings to zero iteratively. During the decimation process the
likelihood function is maximized over the remaining couplings. Unlike the
$\ell_1$-optimization based methods, the decimation method does not use the
Laplace distribution as a heuristic choice of prior to select a sparse
solution. In our case, the whole process can be done automatically without
fixing any parameters by hand. We show that in the dynamical inference problem,
where the task is to reconstruct the couplings of an Ising model given the
data, the decimation process can be applied naturally into a maximum-likelihood
optimization algorithm, as opposed to the static case where pseudo-likelihood
method needs to be adopted. We also use extensive numerical studies to validate
the accuracy of our methods in dynamical inference problems. Our results
illustrate that on various topologies and with different distribution of
couplings, the decimation method outperforms the widely-used $\ell
_1$-optimization based methods.

performance of a D-Wave Two device (DW2) with up to 503 qubits on these
problems and compare it to a suite of classical algorithms, including a highly
optimized algorithm designed to compete directly with the DW2. The problems are
generated around predetermined ground-state configurations, called planted
solutions, which makes them particularly suitable for benchmarking purposes.
The problem set exhibits properties familiar from constraint satisfaction (SAT)
problems, such as a peak in the typical hardness of the problems, determined by
a tunable clause density parameter. We bound the hardness regime where the DW2
device either does not or might exhibit a quantum speedup for our problem set.
While we do not find evidence for a speedup for the hardest and most frustrated
problems in our problem set, we cannot rule out that a speedup might exist for
some of the easier, less frustrated problems. Our empirical findings pertain to
the specific D-Wave processor and problem set we studied and leave open the
possibility that future processors might exhibit a quantum speedup on the same

characterisation of optimal AL behaviour, by treating expected loss reduction

retraining improvement (MRI), a novel approach providing a statistical
estimation framework for AL. This framework is constructed to address the
central question of AL optimality, and to motivate the design of estimation
algorithms. MRI allows the exploration of optimal AL behaviour, and the
examination of AL heuristics, showing precisely how they make sub-optimal
selections. The abstract formulation of MRI is used to provide a new guarantee
for AL, that an unbiased MRI estimator should outperform random selection. This
MRI framework reveals intricate estimation issues that in turn motivate the
construction of new statistical AL algorithms. One new algorithm in particular
performs strongly in a large-scale experimental study, compared to standard AL

curvature gradients? For a particle on a fluid interface, there are two
conditions that can apply at the three phase contact line: Either the contact
line adopts an equilibrium contact angle, or it can be pinned by kinetic
trapping, e.g. at chemical heterogeneities, asperities or other pinning sites
on the particle surface. We formulate the curvature capillary energy for both
scenarios for particles smaller than the capillary length and far from any
pinning boundaries. The scale and range of the distortion made by the particle
are set by the particle radius; we use singular perturbation methods to find
the distortions and to rigorously evaluate the associated capillary energies.
For particles with equilibrium contact angles, contrary to the literature, we
find that the capillary energy is negligible, with the first contribution
bounded to fourth order in the product of the particle radius and the
deviatoric curvature. For pinned contact lines, we find curvature capillary
energies that are finite, with a functional form investigated previously by us
for disks and microcylinders on curved interfaces. In experiments, we show
microsphere migrate along deterministic trajectories toward regions of maximum
deviatoric curvature with curvature capillary energies ranging from $6
\times10^3 - 5 \times 10^4~k_BT$. These data agree with the curvature capillary
energy for the case of pinned contact lines. The underlying physics of this
migration is a coupling of the interface deviatoric curvature with the
quadrupolar mode of nanometric disturbances in the interface owing to the
particle's contact line undulations. This work is an example of the major
implications of nanometric roughness and contact line pinning for colloidal
dynamics.

On finite systems, we noticed that it gives superior performance than GA, while
on infinite systems it asymptotically approaches GA. Analytic analysis together

annotation scheme and lexicon. Our annotation scheme isolates three components
of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation),
a target (an action associated with modality or negation) and a holder (an
experiencer of modality). We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically
produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in
precision around 86% (depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data
set.
  We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a
syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations.
Syntactic tags enriched with semantic annotations are assigned to parse trees
in the target-language training texts through a process of tree grafting. While
the focus of our work is modality and negation, the tree grafting procedure is
general and supports other types of semantic information. We exploit this
capability by including named entities, produced by a pre-existing tagger, in
addition to the MN elements produced by the taggers described in this paper.
The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline
model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009
Urdu-English test set. This finding supports the hypothesis that both syntactic
and semantic information can improve translation quality.

can adopt traversal strategies that minimally disrupt their normal locomotion
patterns or they can adopt strategies that substantially alter their gait,
conferring new advantages and disadvantages. We flew pigeons (Columba livia)
through an array of vertical obstacles in a flight arena, presenting them with
this choice. The pigeons selected either a strategy involving only a slight
pause in the normal wingbeat cycle, or a wings folded posture granting reduced
efficiency but greater stability should a misjudgment lead to collision. The
more stable but less efficient flight strategy was not employed to traverse
easy obstacles with wide gaps for passage, but came to dominate the postures
used as obstacle challenge increased with narrower gaps and there was a greater
chance of a collision. These results indicate that birds weigh potential

on an open disk. Using this uniqueness, we show that the notion of ""bulk"" is
equivalent to the notion of center in mathematics. We achieve this by first
introducing the notion of a morphism between two local topological orders of

monoidal $n$-functor in a few low dimensional cases. We also explain in some
low dimensional cases that this classification is compatible with the result of
""bulk = center"". In the end, we explain that above boundary-bulk relation is
only the first layer of a hierarchical structure which can be summarized by the
functoriality of the bulk (or center). This functoriality also provides the

Indeed, massive stars are the main producers of heavy elements, explode in
supernovae at the end of their short lifetimes, and may be the progenitors of
gamma ray bursts. Intermediate mass stars, although not destined to explode in
supernovae, display similar phenomena, are much more numerous, and have some of
the richest pulsation spectra. A key to understanding these stars is
understanding the effects of rapid rotation on their structure and evolution.
These effects include centrifugal deformation and gravity darkening which can
be observed immediately, and long terms effects such as rotational mixing due
to shear turbulence, which prolong stellar lifetime, modify chemical yields,
and impact the stellar remnant at the end of their lifetime. In order to
understand these effects, a number of models have been and are being developed
over the past few years. These models lead to increasingly sophisticated
predictions which need to be tested through observations. A particularly
promising source of constraints is seismic observations as these may
potentially lead to detailed information on their internal structure. However,
before extracting such information, a number of theoretical and observational
hurdles need to be overcome, not least of which is mode identification. The
present proceedings describe recent progress in modelling these stars and show
how an improved understanding of their pulsations, namely frequency patterns,
mode visibilities, line profile variations, and mode excitation, may help with
deciphering seismic observations.

in the cooperative localization problem of wireless sensor networks. This paper
presents a combinatorial rigidity approach to measure (i) generic rigidity and
(ii) generalized redundant rigidity properties of graph structures through
graph invariants for the localization problem in wireless sensor networks. We
define the rigidity index as a graph invariant based on independent set of
edges in the rigidity matroid. It has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates
how close we are to rigidity. Redundant rigidity is required for global
rigidity, which is associated with unique realization of graphs. Moreover,
redundant rigidity also provides rigidity robustness in networked systems
against structural changes, such as link losses. Here, we give a broader
definition of redundant edge that we call the ""generalized redundant edge.""
This definition of redundancy is valid for both rigid and non-rigid graphs.
Next, we define the redundancy index as a graph invariant based on generalized
redundant edges in the rigidity matroid. It also has a value between 0 and 1,
and it indicates the percentage of redundancy in a graph. These two indices
allow us to explore the transition from non-rigidity to rigidity and the
transition from rigidity to redundant rigidity. Examples on graphs are provided
to demonstrate this approach. From a sensor network point of view, these two
indices enable us to evaluate the effects of sensing radii of sensors on the
rigidity properties of networks, which in turn, allow us to examine the
localizability of sensor networks. We evaluate the required changes in sensing
radii for localizability by means of the rigidity index and the redundancy
index using random geometric graphs in simulations.

separate the planetary image from the image of the host star. Background
estimation is difficult due to the presence of non-common path aberrations

is proposed. This new paradigm will allow simultaneous estimation of the
time-dependent NCPAs and the planetary image via rigorous statistical inference
procedures. These procedures are fully compatible with other information

  We then revisit Boltzmann machines (BM) from a model selection perspective
and theoretically show that both the fully visible BM (VBM) and the BM with
hidden units can be derived from the general binary multivariate distribution
using the CIF principle. This can help us uncover and formalize the essential
parts of the target density that BM aims to capture and the non-essential parts
that BM should discard. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we develop a
sample-specific CIF for model selection of BM that is adaptive to the observed
samples. The method is studied in a series of density estimation experiments
and has been shown effective in terms of the estimate accuracy.

two different types of audio signals are analyzed in terms of sparsity and CS

this paper it has been shown that this neglect could have serious consequences

the expulsion of very small bits of the magnetic field lines, rather than the
wholesale expulsion of the complete magnetic lines encapsulated in the previous

from superbubbles, when they break out of the galactic disc and their shell
fragment. This leads to a {\it cut } in the lines of force that still remain in
the disc. Subsequently, normal disc turbulence rotates the {\it cut} lines and
thus dissipates their mean flux removing them from a role in the dynamo theory.
This new process takes a length of time comparable, but a little longer than
the previous growth time of the disc dynamo, but avoids the previous
difficulties associated with flux-freezing and flux expulsion.

derivative of the background inflaton field vanishes. This happens because the

down when d\Phi/dt=0. The issue is usually bypassed by averaging out the

is the formulation of the equation of motion of classical mechanics in the

tight gate control and high electric fields at the tunnel junction, and can in
principle generate high ON-currents along with a sub-threshold swing smaller
than 60 mV/dec. Our simulations reveal that high performance TMD TFETs, not
only require good gate control, but also rely on the choice of the right
channel material with optimum band gap, effective mass and source/drain doping
level. Unlike previous works, a full band atomistic tight binding method is
used self-consistently with 3D Poisson equation to simulate ballistic quantum
transport in these devices. The effect of the choice of TMD material on the
performance of the device and its transfer characteristics are discussed.
Moreover, the criteria for high ON-currents are explained with a simple
analytic model, showing the related fundamental factors. Finally, the

during the evolution of the field from its earliest days. At first figuring
prominently in support of bottom-up indexing, it fell out of favor as shape
gave way to appearance and recognition gave way to detection. With a strong
prior in the form of a target object, the role of the weaker priors offered by
perceptual grouping was greatly diminished. However, as the field returns to
the problem of recognition from a large database, the bottom-up recovery of the
parts that make up the objects in a cluttered scene is critical for their
recognition. The medial axis community has long exploited the ubiquitous
regularity of symmetry as a basis for the decomposition of a closed contour
into medial parts. However, today's recognition systems are faced with
cluttered scenes, and the assumption that a closed contour exists, i.e. that
figure-ground segmentation has been solved, renders much of the medial axis
community's work inapplicable. In this article, we review a computational
framework, previously reported in Lee et al. (2013), Levinshtein et al. (2009,
2013), that bridges the representation power of the medial axis and the need to
recover and group an object's parts in a cluttered scene. Our framework is
rooted in the idea that a maximally inscribed disc, the building block of a
medial axis, can be modeled as a compact superpixel in the image. We evaluate
the method on images of cluttered scenes.

into cells via membrane vesicles. It plays an integral role in nutrient import,
signal transduction, neurotransmission and cellular entry of pathogens and
drug-carrying nanoparticles. As CME entails substantial local remodeling of the
plasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending
and hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high tension
conditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this
study, we build upon these pioneering experimental studies to provide
fundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins,
namely, actin and BAR proteins in driving vesicle formation in high membrane
tension environment. Our study reveals a new actin force induced `snap-through
instability' that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination
to a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR
proteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we
present a new counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the
shape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins,
supported by actin-BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing

astronomically observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), which shows
unique molecular structure with carbon two pentagons connected with five
hexagons. Well observed astronomical infrared spectrum from 3-15 micron could
be almost reproduced based on density functional theory. However, there remain
several discrepancies with observed spectra, especially on 11-15 micron band
weaker intensity. Observed 11.2 micron intensity is comparable to 7.6-7.8
micron one. Methyl-modified molecule C24H14++ revealed that calculated peak
height of 11.4 micron show fairly large intensity up to 70-90% compared with
that of 7.6-7.8 micron band. Also, nitrogen atom was substituted to peripheral
C-H site of void coronene to be C22H11N1++. Pentagon site substituted case show
60% peak height. This molecule also reproduced well 12-15 micron peak position
and relative intensity. Vibration mode analysis demonstrated that 11.3 micron
mode comes from C-H out of plane bending. Heavy nitrogen plays as like an
anchor role for molecule vibration.

galactic nucleus (AGN) like activity of the Galactic center supermassive black

activities. Star formation scenarios predict higher metallicities and abundance
ratios of [O/Fe] and [Ne/Fe] than AGN scenarios do because of supernovae
ejecta. Furthermore, the resultant abundance depends on the gamma-ray emission
process because different mass injection histories are required for the
different gamma-ray emission processes due to the acceleration and cooling time
scales of non-thermal particles. Future X-ray missions such as ASTRO-H and
Athena will give a clue to probe the origin of the bubbles through abundance
measurements with their high energy resolution instruments.

statistically dependent on a set of hidden channel parameters, called the
channel state. The channel state evolves in time according to a known, non
stationary, nonlinear and/or non Gaussian Markov stochastic kernel. This
formulation results in a partially observable system, with a temporally varying
global state and spatiotemporally varying observations. Recognizing the
intractability of general nonlinear state estimation, we advocate the use of
grid based approximate filters as an effective and robust means for recursive
tracking of the channel state. We also propose a sequential spatiotemporal
predictor for tracking the channel gains at any point in time and space,
providing real time sequential estimates for the respective channel gain map,
for each sensor in the network. Additionally, we show that both estimators
converge towards the true respective MMSE optimal estimators, in a common,
relatively strong sense. Numerical simulations corroborate the practical

bundle algorithm that only solves linear subproblems. We start from
minimization of a convex function and show that the sequence of major
iterations converge to a minimizer. For nonconvex functions we consider
functions that are locally Lipschitz continuous and prox-regular on a bounded
level set, and minimize the cutting-plane model over a trust region with
infinity norm. The para-convexity of such functions allows us to use the
locally convexified model and its convexity properties. Under some conditions
and assumptions, we study the convergence of the proposed algorithm through the
outer semicontinuity of the proximal mapping. Encouraging results of
preliminary numerical experiments on standard test sets are provided.

an opaque nebula of CNO-processed material, perhaps analogous to Eta Car and
its Homunculus nebula, albeit with a hotter central source. To discern the
morphology of the [N II] nebula we performed narrowband imaging using the
Hubble Space Telescope and Wide-field Camera 3. The images reveal that the
nebula has a disk-like geometry tilted 12 degrees from edge-on, composed of a
bright central ellipsoid surrounded by a larger clumpy ring. Ground-based
spectroscopy reveals radial velocity structure (~10 km/s) near the outer
portions of the nebula's major axis, which is likely to be the imprint of
outflowing gas. Near-infrared adaptive-optics imaging with Magellan AO has
resolved a compact ellipsoid of Ks-band emission aligned with the larger [N II]
nebula, which we suspect is the result of scattered He I line emission (2.06
um). Observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory have revealed an X-ray
point source at the core of the nebula that is heavily absorbed at energies <1
keV and has properties consistent with WR stars and colliding-wind binaries. We
suggest that NaSt1 is a WR binary embedded in an equatorial outflow that formed
as the result of non-conservative mass transfer. NaSt1 thus appears to be a
rare and important example of a stripped-envelope WR forming through binary
interaction, caught in the brief Roche-lobe overflow phase.

believed to propagate diffusively. But a well-known defect of diffusive
approximation whereby some of the particles propagate unrealistically fast has
directed interest towards an alternative CR transport model based on the
""telegraph"" equation. However, its derivations often lack rigor and
transparency leading to inconsistent results.
  We apply the classic Chapman-Enskog method to the CR transport problem. We
show that no ""telegraph"" (second order time derivative) term emerges in any
order of a proper asymptotic expansion with systematically eliminated short
time scales. Nevertheless, this term may formally be\emph{ converted} from the
\emph{fourth} order hyper-diffusive term of the expansion. But, both the
telegraph and hyperdiffusive terms may only be important for a short relaxation
period associated with either strong pitch-angle anisotropy or spatial
inhomogeneity of the initial CR distribution. Beyond this period the system
evolves diffusively in both cases. The term conversion, that makes the
telegraph and Chapman-Enskog approaches reasonably equivalent, is possible only
after this relaxation period. During this period, the telegraph solution is
argued to be unphysical. Unlike the hyperdiffusion correction, it is not
uniformly valid and introduces implausible singular components to the solution.
These dominate the solution during the relaxation period. As they are shown not
to be inherent in the underlying scattering problem, we argue that the
telegraph term is involuntarily acquired in an asymptotic reduction of the
problem.

universal KWR in many multiband metals. We identify a limit where the
universality of the ratio, which has been observed experimentally in many
strongly correlated electron systems, is recovered. We discuss the KWR in Dirac
semimetals in two and three dimensions. In the two-dimensional case we also
generalize the KWR to account for the logarithmic factor in the self-energy. In
both cases we find that the KWR is independent of correlations, but strongly
dependent on the doping of the system: for massless fermions the KWR is
proportional to the inverse square of the carrier density, whereas the KWR for

lower (Z \le 10^-4 Z_\odot) and higher (Z > 10^-4 Z_\odot) metallicities.
Fragmentation frequently occurs and many protostars appear without forming a
stable circumstellar disc in lower-metallicity clouds. In these clouds,
although protostars mutually interact and some are ejected from the cloud
centre, many remain as a small stellar cluster. In contrast, higher-metallicity
clouds produce a single protostar surrounded by a nearly stable
rotation-supported disc. In these clouds, although fragmentation occasionally
occurs in the disc, the fragments migrate inwards and finally fall onto the
central protostar. The difference in cloud evolution is due to different
thermal evolutions and mass accretion rates. The thermal evolution of the cloud
determines the emergence and lifetime of the first core. The first core
develops prior to the protostar formation in higher-metallicity clouds, whereas
no (obvious) first core appears in lower-metallicity clouds. The first core
evolves into a circumstellar disc with a spiral pattern, which effectively
transfers the angular momentum outwards and suppresses frequent fragmentation.
In lower-metallicity clouds, the higher mass accretion rate increases the disc
surface density within a very short time, rendering the disc unstable to
self-gravity and inducing vigorous fragmentation.

and even bonds are observed in odd- and even-Haldane phases, respectively. A
rich phase diagram including four different phases, i.e., an antiferromagnetic
(AF), AF stripe, odd- and even-Haldane phases, is obtained. These phases are
found to be separated by continuous QPTs: the topological QPT between the odd-

conformal field theory with central charge $c$=1; while the rest phase
transitions in the phase diagram are found to be $c$=1/2. We also revisit, with

only on odd bonds, and find that the even-Haldane phase disappears, but the

are spectroscopically classified in previous work (mainly SDSS), and form the
training set for a search for additional such sources. We apply our selection
to 2,916 FIRST-DR7 pairs and find 15 likely candidates. Seven of these are
confirmed as high-redshift quasars, bringing the total to 87. The candidates
were selected using a neural-network, which yields 97% completeness (fraction
of actual high-z QSOs selected as such) and an efficiency (fraction of
candidates which are high-z QSOs) in the range of 47 to 60%. We use this sample
to estimate the binned optical luminosity function of radio-loud QSOs at $z\sim
4$, and also the LF of the total QSO population and its comoving density. Our
results suggest that the radio-loud fraction (RLF) at high z is similar to that
at low-z and that other authors may be underestimating the fraction at high-z.
Finally, we determine the slope of the optical luminosity function and obtain
results consistent with previous studies of radio-loud QSOs and of the whole
population of QSOs. The evolution of the luminosity function with redshift was
for many years interpreted as a flattening of the bright end slope, but has
recently been re-interpreted as strong evolution of the break luminosity for
high-z QSOs, and our results, for the radio-loud population, are consistent
with this.

provides only four of the six coordinates required for a unique orbital
solution. Probability distributions of possible solutions are commonly
generated by Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, but these are biased by priors and
may not probe the full parameter space. We suggest alternative methods to
characterise possible orbits, which compliment the MCMC technique. Firstly the
allowed ranges of orbital elements are prior-independent, and we provide means
to calculate these ranges without numerical analyses. Hence several interesting
constraints (including whether a companion even can be bound, its minimum
possible semi-major axis and its minimum eccentricity) may be quickly computed
using our relations as soon as orbital motion is detected. We also suggest an
alternative to posterior probability distributions as a means to present
possible orbital elements, namely contour plots of elements as functions of
line of sight coordinates. These plots are prior-independent, readily show
degeneracies between elements and allow readers to extract orbital solutions
themselves. This approach is particularly useful when there are other
constraints on the geometry, for example if a companion's orbit is assumed to
be aligned with a disc. As examples we apply our methods to several imaged
sub-stellar companions including Fomalhaut b, and for the latter object we show
how different origin hypotheses affect its possible orbital solutions. We also
examine visual companions of A- and G-type main sequence stars in the
Washington Double Star Catalogue, and show that $\gtrsim50$ per cent must be

hosting a habitable planet with respect to the models without radial flow, in
the region of maximum probability for this occurrence. In the Milky Way the
maximum number of stars hosting habitable planets is at 8 kpc from the Galactic
center, and the model with radial gas flows predicts a number of planets which

reconnection during the emergence of small-scale active regions. In particular,
to examine how the large-scale geometry of the magnetic field, shaped by
different phases of reconnection, guides the flowing of surges. Methods: We
present three flux emergence models. The first model, and the simplest,
consists of a region emerging into a horizontal ambient field that is initially
parallel to the top of the emerging region. The second model is the same as the
first but with an extra smaller emerging region which perturbs the main region.
This is added to create a more complex magnetic topology and to test how this
complicates the development of surges compared to the first model. The last
model has a non-uniform ambient magnetic field to model the effects of
emergence near a sunspot field and impose asymmetry on the system through the
ambient magnetic field. At each stage, we trace the magnetic topology to
identify the locations of reconnection. This allows for field lines to be
plotted from different topological regions, highlighting how their geometry
affects the development of surges. Results: In the first model, we identify
distinct phases of reconnection. Each phase is associated with a particular
geometry for the magnetic field and this determines the paths of the surges.
The second model follows a similar pattern to the first but with a more complex
magnetic topology and extra eruptions. The third model highlights how an
asymmetric ambient field can result in preferred locations for reconnection,
subsequently guiding the direction of surges.

measurements of the aforementioned CME properties. The mission's secondary
objective is to provide vital data to update scientific models. In-situ
measurements are performed using a Solar Wind Analyzer instrumentation package
and flux gate magnetometers, while coronagraphs execute remote measurements.
Communication with the six identical spacecraft is realized via a deep space
network consisting of six ground stations. They provide an information service

SW monitoring. The data will be handled by a dedicated processing center before
being forwarded to the SSA Space Weather Coordination Center who will manage

anticorrelation between REE abundances and pyroxene mode may be understood as
due to dilution by addition of silica to the chondrule melt, as in the gas-melt

equilibration with silicates upon slow cooling (1-100 K/h), largely by
oxidation/evaporation of Fe. We propose that Ni-poorer, amoeboid margin grains,
often included in the pyroxene-rich periphery common to type I chondrules,
result from less intense processing of a rim accreted onto the chondrule
subsequent to the melting event recorded by the interior. This means either
that there were two separate heating events, which formed olivine/interior
grains and pyroxene/margin grains, respectively, between which dust was
accreted around the chondrule, or there was a single high-temperature event, of
which the chondrule margin record a late ""quenching phase"", in which case dust
accreted onto chondrules while they were molten. In the latter case, high dust

simulate the time-dependent evolution of the continuous system using exact

analyze the occupation of the instantaneous energy levels and compare the
situation in a homogeneous system with the trapped one. Strong differences are
found in particular in the evolution of excitations which we trace back to the
distinct global density distribution. Starting from an imbalanced state in the
superlattice potential, we consider the relaxation dynamics of fermions after a
slow change of the superlattice potential and find a bimodule distribution of

simulate the measurement sequence of the even and odd local density and find a
strong dependence of the outcome on the actual ramp procedure. We suggest how
the loading and detecting procedure can be optimized.

improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little

particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to
train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate
deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks
(PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012

Pseudo-inverse IHT. We also show on simulations that a random arrangement of
the spectral filters on the sensor is preferable to regular mosaic layout as it

microscopic Fleury-Loudon Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of an effective
$O(3)$ - model. Well within the N\'eel ordered phase, the Raman spectrum
contains a two-magnon and a two-Higgs contribution, which are calculated
diagramatically. The vertex functions for both the Higgs and magnon
contributions are determined from a numerical solution of the corresponding
Bethe-Salpeter equation. Due to the momentum dependence of the Raman vertex in
the relevant $B_{1g}+E_{2g}$ symmetry, the contribution from the Higgs mode is
strongly suppressed. Except for intermediate values of the Higgs mass, it does
not show up as separate peak in the spectrum but gives rise to a broad
continuum above the dominant contribution from two-magnon excitations. The
latter give rise to a broad, asymmetric peak at $\omega\simeq 2.44\, J$, which
is a result of magnon-magnon interactions mediated by the Higgs mode. The full
Raman spectrum is determined completely by the antiferromagnetic exchange
coupling $J$ and a dimensionless Higgs mass. Experimental Raman spectra of
undoped cuprates turn out to be in very good agreement with the theory only
with inclusion of the Higgs contribution. They thus provide a clear signature

dominated bodies using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The
improvements include an updated strength model and a friction model, which are
successfully tested by a comparison with laboratory experiments. In the
modeling of catastrophic disruptions of asteroids, a comparison between old and
new strength models shows no significant deviation in the case of targets which
are initially non-porous, fully intact and have a homogeneous structure (such
as the targets used in the study by Benz&Asphaug (1999). However, for many
cases (e.g. initially partly or fully damaged targets, rubble-pile structures,
etc.) we find that it is crucial that friction is taken into account and the
material has a pressure dependent shear strength. Our investigations of the
catastrophic disruption threshold $Q^*_{D}$ as a function of target properties
and target sizes up to a few 100 km show that a fully damaged target modeled
without friction has a $Q^*_{D}$ which is significantly (5-10 times) smaller
than in the case where friction is included. When the effect of the energy
dissipation due to compaction (pore crushing) is taken into account as well,
the targets become even stronger ($Q^*_{D}$ is increased by a factor of 2-3).
On the other hand, cohesion is found to have an negligible effect at large
scales and is only important at scales $\lesssim$ 1km. Our results show the
relative effects of strength, friction and porosity on the outcome of
collisions among small ($\lesssim$ 1000 km) bodies. These results will be used
in a future study to improve existing scaling laws for the outcome of
collisions (e.g. Leinhardt&Stewart, 2012).

planar surfaces that interact favorably with certain residues. Using a coarse
grained model, we systematically studied the folding and adsorption behavior of
a $\beta$-roll forming polypeptide. We find that there are two different
folding pathways depending on the temperature: (i) at low temperature, the
polypeptide folds in solution into a $\beta$-roll before adsorbing onto the
attractive surface, (ii) at higher temperature, the polypeptide first adsorbs
in a disordered state, and folds while on the surface. The folding temperature
increases with increasing attraction, as the folded $\beta$-roll is stabilized
by the surface. Surprisingly, further increasing the attraction lowers the
folding temperature again, as strong attraction also stabilizes the adsorbed
disordered state, which competes with folding of the polypeptide. Our results
suggest that to enhance the folding, one should use a weakly attractive
surface. They also explain the recent experimental observation of the
non-monotonic effect of charge on the fibril formation on an oppositely charged
surface [C. Charbonneau, et al., ACS Nano, 8, 2328 (2014)].

mappings we also show that any Gaussian-to-Gaussian superoperator can be
expressed as a concatenation of a phase-space dilatation, followed by the
action of a completely positive Gaussian channel, possibly composed with a
transposition. While a similar decomposition is shown to fail in the multi-mode
scenario, we prove that it still holds at least under the further hypothesis of
homogeneous action on the covariance matrix.

allows for low power and memory consumption. This has led to popularity of
comparatively efficient Elliptic curve cryptog-raphy (ECC). Prior to this
paper, much of ECC is implemented on re-configurable hardware i.e. FPGAs, which
are costly and unfavorable as low-cost solutions. We present comprehensive yet
efficient implementations of ECC on fixed-point TMS54xx series of digital
signal processors (DSP). 160-bit prime field GF(p) ECC is implemented over a
wide range of coordinate choices. This paper also implements windowed recoding
technique to provide better execution times. Stalls in the programming are
mini-mized by utilization of loop unrolling and by avoiding data dependence.
Complete scalar multiplication is achieved within 50 msec in coordinate
implementations, which is further reduced till 25 msec for windowed-recoding
method. These are the best known results for fixed-point low power digital
signal processor to date.

computational overhead. A multiple resolution approach is used also in the time
integration in order to maintain the stability of the scalars on the finer
grid. The method is the more advantageous the less diffusive the scalar is with
respect to momentum, therefore it is particularly well suited for large Prandtl

present procedure gives CPU time and memory occupation savings. The reason is
that the absence of the pressure term in the scalar equation leads to much
steeper gradients in the scalar field as compared to the velocity field.

(WIMP), is a particle produced during the early evolution of the Universe whose
present (relic) abundance depends only on its mass and its thermally averaged
annihilation cross section (annihilation rate factor) sigma*v_ann. Late time
WIMP annihilation has the potential to affect the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) power spectrum. Current observational constraints on the absence of such
effects provide bounds on the mass and the annihilation cross section of relic
particles that may, but need not be dark matter candidates. For a WIMP that is
a dark matter candidate, the CMB constraint sets an upper bound to the
annihilation cross section, leading to a lower bound to its mass that depends
on whether or not the WIMP is its own antiparticle. For a self-conjugate WIMP,
m_min = 50f GeV, where f is an electromagnetic energy efficiency factor. For a
non self-conjugate WIMP, the minimum mass is a factor of two larger. For a WIMP
that is a subdominant component of the dark matter density there is no bound on
its mass and the upper bound to its annihilation cross section imposed by the
CMB transforms into a lower bound to its annihilation cross section. These
results are outlined and quantified here using the latest CMB constraints for a

interesting question is that whether the decoupled uplink (UL) /downlink (DL)

default of all them. All shocks are assumed to be linked by a dependence
relationship, that in this paper is assumed to be exchangeable and Archimedean.
This approach is able to encompass both systemic risk and contagion, with the

extreme cases. Moreover, we show that assuming an affine structure for the
intensities of idiosyncratic and systemic shocks and a Gumbel copula, the

word transformations performed by $\mathfrak A$ by a point set $\mathbf
P(\mathfrak A)$ in real plane $\mathbb R^2$.
  For a finite-state automaton $\mathfrak A$, it is shown that once some points
of $\mathbf P(\mathfrak A)$ constitute a smooth (of a class $C^2$) curve in
$\mathbb R^2$, the curve is a segment of a straight line with a rational slope;
and there are only finitely many straight lines whose segments are in
$\mathbf{P}(\mathfrak A)$. Moreover, when identifying $\mathbf P(\mathfrak A)$
with a subset of a 2-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2\subset\mathbb R^3$ (under a
natural mapping of the real unit square $[0,1]^2$ onto $\mathbb T^2$) the
smooth curves from $\mathbf P(\mathfrak A)$ constitute a collection of torus
windings. In cylindrical coordinates either of the windings can be ascribed to
a complex-valued function $\psi(x)=e^{i(Ax-2\pi B(t))}$ $(x\in\mathbb R)$ for
suitable rational $A,B(t)$. Since $\psi(x)$ is a standard expression for a
matter wave in quantum theory (where $B(t)=tB(t_0)$), and since transducers can
be regarded as a mathematical formalization for causal discrete systems, the
paper might serve as a mathematical reasoning why wave phenomena are inherent
in quantum systems: This is because of causality principle and the discreteness
of matter.

contrast to the existing WL-MMSE transceivers for single-user multiple-input
multiple-output (SU-MIMO) systems, which use both WL precoders and WL
detectors, the proposed scheme uses WL precoding only and simple conventional
detection at the user terminals (UTs). Moreover, to avoid the computational
complexity associated with inversion of large matrices, we modify the WL-MMSE
precoder using polynomial expansion (PE). Our simulation results show that in
overloaded systems, where the number of UTs is larger than the number of base
station antennas, the proposed PE WL-MMSE precoder with only a few terms in the
matrix polynomial achieves a substantially higher sum rate than systems
employing conventional MMSE precoding. Hence, more UTs sharing the same
time/frequency resources can be served in a cell. We validate our simulation
results with an analytical expression for the asymptotic sum rate which is
obtained by using results from random matrix theory.

already been applied in various bivariate and multivariate contexts. Recently,
SPIKE-Synchronization was proposed as another time-resolved synchronization
measure. It is based on Event-Synchronization and has a very intuitive
interpretation. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the mathematical
properties of these three synchronization measures. For example, we were able
to obtain analytic expressions for the expectation values of the ISI-distance
and SPIKE-Synchronization for Poisson spike trains. For the SPIKE-distance we
present an empirical formula deduced from numerical evaluations. These
expectation values are crucial for interpreting the synchronization of spike
trains measured in experiments or numerical simulations, as they represent the
point of reference for fully randomized spike trains.

using the modern comparable transactions analysis and the business valuation
techniques in the diffusion type financial systems in the finances. We
developed the MicroMA software program with the embedded optimized
near-real-time artificial intelligence algorithm to create the winning virtuous
M and A strategies, using the financial performance characteristics of the
involved firms, and to estimate the probability of the M and A transaction
completion success. We believe that the fluctuating dependence of M and A
transactions number over the certain time period is quasi periodic. We think
that there are many factors, which can generate the quasi periodic oscillations
of the M and A transactions number in the time domain, for example: the stock
market bubble effects. We performed the research of the nonlinearities in the M
and A transactions number quasi-periodic oscillations in Matlab, including the
ideal, linear, quadratic, and exponential dependences. We discovered that the
average of a sum of random numbers in the M and A transactions time series
represents a time series with the quasi periodic systematic oscillations, which
can be finely approximated by the polynomial numbers. We think that, in the
course of the M and A transaction implementation, the ability by the companies

knowledge bases, is a key predeterminant of the M and A deal completion success

However, since then no much more has been done on this subject and we believe
there are some relevant aspects yet to explore. In addition to the results
previously found we calculate the thermodynamic potentials, the efficiency of
the Carnot engine, the law for adiabatic processes and the heat capacity at
constant volume. There is a region at which an interesting behavior of the
thermodynamic potentials arise, maxima and minima appear for the $n-d$ BBR
system at very high temperatures and low dimensionality, suggesting a possible
application to cosmology. Finally we propose that an optimality criterion in a
thermodynamic framework could have to do with the $3-d$ nature of the universe.

  Rating and the Performance of His Party in the Midterm Elections",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the years, American politics have become increasingly polarized. In the
current political landscape, a president cannot easily collaborate with the
opposite party and pass legislature. Ideologies between parties have drifted
apart to the point that one party generally stonewalls any legislature proposed
by the other party. Because of this political landscape, it is paramount for a
president to have a majority of his party in Congress. Political parties invest
a great deal of time and effort into making sure that first their Presidential
candidate wins and is popular, and then their congressional candidates win
seats in Congress. In this study, the effect of the former on the latter was
investigated - how the approval rating of the president influences the number
of seats won or lost in Congress during the midterm elections. The data used
was collected from Gallup. An analysis of the data yielded the statistically
significant linear model y = -107.423+1.594x, where x is the approval rating of
the president and y is the number of Congressional seats won or lost by the
party of the president. Further analysis yielded a 20 percent more
statistically useful model for approval ratings greater than 50 percent: y =
-275.461+4.37551x. As of the eve of the 2014 Midterms, President Barrack Obama
had an approval rating of 44 percent. Using the originally derived linear
model, it can be said with 95 percent confidence that the Democratic Party will
lose between 27 and 48 seats in Congress, rounded to the nearest whole seat.
This prediction has since been proven correct.
