The Stability-Plasticity dilemma. In order to do that, we rate rules by
introducing several metrics through the first adaptation, to our knowledge, of
the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a coverage graph, a hierarchical

qualitatively similar to what would have been in Brans-Dicke, in general it can
be a good discriminator between many alternative theories. Although the

asymmetry, but with a maximum of around 1.5e17 cm-2 at central meridian
longitude L = 200-220 and a minimum of around 3e16 cm-2 at L = 285-300, the
longitudinal pattern somewhat differs from earlier inferences from Ly {\alpha}
and thermal IR measurements. Within the accuracy of the measurements, no
evolution of the atmospheric density from mid-2008 to mid-2010 can be
distinguished. The decrease of the SO2 column density towards high latitude is
apparent, and the typical latitudinal extent of the atmosphere found to be (+-)
40{\deg} at half-maximum. The data show moderate diurnal variations of the
equatorial atmosphere, which is evidence for a partially sublimation-supported
atmospheric component. Compared to local noon, factor of 2 lower densities are
observed around 40{\deg} before and 80{\deg} after noon. Best-fit gas
temperatures range from 150 to 220 K, with a weighted mean value of 170 (+-) 20

($\sim 2~$sr, limited only by the atmospheric absorption) and the high duty

short and unexpected events like GRBs. With the scaler mode technique, i.e.,
counting all the particles hitting the detector with no measurement of the
primary energy and arrival direction, the minimum threshold of $\sim$ 1 GeV can
be reached, overlapping the direct measurements carried out by satellites.

with reliable visual morphologies is considered, for which we measure
structural parameters by fitting multi-wavelength single-S\'ersic models.
Additionally, we use a set of artificially redshifted galaxies to test how
these classifiers behave when the signal-to-noise decreases. Results. We show
that the wavelength-dependence of n may be employed to separate
visually-classified early- and late-type galaxies, in a manner similar to the
use of colour and n. Furthermore, we find that the wavelength variation of n
can recover galaxies that are misclassified by these other morphological
proxies. Roughly half of the spiral galaxies that contaminate an early-type
sample selected using (u-r) versus n can be correctly identified as late-types
by N, the ratio of n measured in two different bands. Using a set of
artificially-redshifted images, we show that this technique remains effective
up to z ~ 0.1. N can therefore be used to achieve purer samples of early-types
and more complete samples of late-types than using a colour-n cut alone. We
also study the suitability of R, the ratio of Re in two different bands, as a
morphological classifier, but find that the average sizes of both early- and
late-type galaxies do not change substantially over optical wavelengths.

mixing processes can become relevant for redistributing chemical species in a
star. We investigate a process of ""differential heating,"" which occurs when a
temperature fluctuation propagates by radiative diffusion from the boundary of
a convection zone into the adjacent radiative zone. The resulting perturbation
of the hydrostatic equilibrium causes a flow that extends some distance from
the convection zone. We study a simplified differential-heating problem with a
static temperature fluctuation imposed on a solid boundary. The astrophysically
relevant limit of a high Reynolds number and a low P\'eclet number (high
thermal diffusivity) turns out to be interestingly non-intuitive. We derive a
set of scaling relations for the stationary differential heating flow. A
numerical method adapted to a high dynamic range in flow amplitude needed to
detect weak flows is presented. Our two-dimensional simulations show that the
flow reaches a stationary state and confirm the analytic scaling relations.
These imply that the flow speed drops abruptly to a negligible value at a
finite height above the source of heating. We approximate the mixing rate due
to the differential heating flow in a star by a height-dependent diffusion
coefficient and show that this mixing extends about $4\%$ of the pressure scale
height above the convective core of a $10\,M_\odot$ zero-age main sequence
star.

finite games. Any strong Nash equilibrium outcome is Pareto efficient for each
coalition. First, we analyze the two--player setting. Our main result, in its
simplest form, states that if a game has a strong Nash equilibrium with full
support (that is, both players randomize among all pure strategies), then the
game is strictly competitive. In order to get our result we use the
indifference principle fulfilled by any Nash equilibrium, and the classical KKT
conditions (in the vector setting), that are necessary conditions for Pareto
efficiency. Our characterization enables us to design a
strong-Nash-equilibrium-finding algorithm with complexity in
Smoothed-$\mathcal{P}$. So, this problem---that Conitzer and Sandholm
[Conitzer, V., Sandholm, T., 2008. New complexity results about Nash
equilibria. Games Econ. Behav. 63, 621--641] proved to be computationally hard
in the worst case---is generically easy. Hence, although the worst case
complexity of finding a strong Nash equilibrium is harder than that of finding
a Nash equilibrium, once small perturbations are applied, finding a strong Nash
is easier than finding a Nash equilibrium. Next we switch to the setting with
more than two players. We demonstrate that a strong Nash equilibrium can exist
in which an outcome that is strictly Pareto dominated by a Nash equilibrium
occurs with positive probability. Finally, we prove that games that have a
strong Nash equilibrium where at least one player puts positive probability on
at least two pure strategies are extremely rare: they are of zero measure.

system is isolated in its evolution and the particle number $N$ is fixed. The
loss of phase memory is due to interactions of the condensate with the excited
modes that constitute a dephasing environment. This fundamental effect, crucial
for applications using the condensate of pairs' macroscopic coherence, was
scarcely studied. We link the coherence time to the condensate phase dynamics,
and we show with a microscopic theory that the time derivative of the
condensate phase operator $\hat{\theta}\_0$ is proportional to a chemical
potential operator that we construct including both the pair-breaking and
pair-motion excitation branches. In a single realization of energy $E$,
$\hat{\theta}\_0$ evolves at long times as $-2\mu\_{\rm mc}(E)t/\hbar$ where
$\mu\_{\rm mc}(E)$ is the microcanonical chemical potential; energy
fluctuations from one realization to the other then lead to a ballistic
spreading of the phase and to a Gaussian decay of the temporal coherence
function with a characteristic time $\propto N^{1/2}$. In the absence of energy
fluctuations, the coherence time scales as $N$ due to the diffusive motion of
$\hat{\theta}\_0$. We propose a method to measure the coherence time with
ultracold atoms, which we predict to be tens of milliseconds for the canonical

non Markovian models. Recently, after the introduction of the so-called
pathwise (or functional or Dupire) calculus (see [15]), in the case of
finite-dimensional underlying space various papers have been devoted to
studying the well-posedness of such kind of equations, both from the point of
view of regular solutions (see e.g. [15, 9]) and viscosity solutions (see e.g.
[16]). In this paper, motivated by the study of models driven by path-dependent
stochastic PDEs, we give a first well-posedness result for viscosity solutions
of PPDEs when the underlying space is a separable Hilbert space. We also
observe that, in contrast with the finite-dimensional case, our well-posedness
result, even in the Markovian case, applies to equations which cannot be
treated, up to now, with the known theory of viscosity solutions.

between confined and deconfined phases of strongly interacting matter created
in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The model was formulated in the late 1990s for
central Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS energies. It predicted several signals
of the transition (onset of deconfinement) which were later observed by the
NA49 experiment. The grand canonical ensemble was used to calculate entropy and
strangeness production. This approximation is valid for reactions with mean
multiplicities of particles carrying conserved charges being significantly
larger than one.
  Recent results of NA61/SHINE on hadron production in inelastic p+p
interactions suggest that the deconfinement may also take place in these
reactions. However, in this case mean multiplicity of particles with non-zero
strange charge is smaller than one. Thus for the modeling of p+p interactions
the exact strangeness conservation has to be implemented in the SMES. This
extension of the SMES is presented in the paper.

information processing. Here we investigate how particular features of network
connectivity underpin the propensity of neural networks to generate
slow-switching assembly (SSA) dynamics, i.e., sustained epochs of increased
firing within assemblies of neurons which transition slowly between different
assemblies throughout the network. We show that the emergence of SSA activity
is linked to spectral properties of the asymmetric synaptic weight matrix. In
particular, the leading eigenvalues that dictate the slow dynamics exhibit a
gap with respect to the bulk of the spectrum, and the associated Schur vectors
exhibit a measure of block-localization on groups of neurons, thus resulting in
coherent dynamical activity on those groups. Through simple rate models, we
gain analytical understanding of the origin and importance of the spectral gap,
and use these insights to develop new network topologies with alternative
connectivity paradigms which also display SSA activity. Specifically, SSA
dynamics involving excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be achieved by
modifying the connectivity patterns between both types of neurons. We also show
that SSA activity can occur at multiple timescales reflecting a hierarchy in
the connectivity, and demonstrate the emergence of SSA in small-world like
networks. Our work provides a step towards understanding how network structure
(uncovered through advancements in neuroanatomy and connectomics) can impact on
spatio-temporal neural activity and constrain the resulting dynamics.

facilities. For the first time, the source is detected in $\gamma$-rays by the

  Finding the worst-case performance of a black-box first-order method is
formulated as an optimization problem over a set of smooth (strongly) convex
functions and initial conditions. We develop closed-form necessary and
sufficient conditions for smooth (strongly) convex interpolation, which provide
a finite representation for those functions. This allows us to reformulate the
worst-case performance estimation problem as an equivalent finite
dimension-independent semidefinite optimization problem, whose exact solution
can be recovered up to numerical precision. Optimal solutions to this
performance estimation problem provide both worst-case performance bounds and
explicit functions matching them, as our smooth (strongly) convex interpolation
procedure is constructive.
  Our works build on those of Drori and Teboulle in [Math. Prog. 145 (1-2),

problem for smooth convex functions.
  We apply our approach to different fixed-step first-order methods with
several performance criteria, including objective function accuracy and
gradient norm. We conjecture several numerically supported worst-case bounds on
the performance of the fixed-step gradient, fast gradient and optimized
gradient methods, both in the smooth convex and the smooth strongly convex
cases, and deduce tight estimates of the optimal step size for the gradient

subset of vertices has higher connectivity than the background. In particular,
the average degree inside this subset of vertices is larger than outside (but
still bounded). Given a realization of such graph, we aim at identifying the
hidden subset of vertices. This can be regarded as a model for the problem of
finding a tightly knitted community in a social network, or a cluster in a
relational dataset.
  In this paper we present two sets of contributions: $(i)$ We use the cavity
method from spin glass theory to derive an exact phase diagram for the
reconstruction problem. In particular, as the difference in edge probability
increases, the problem undergoes two phase transitions, a static phase
transition and a dynamic one. $(ii)$ We establish rigorous bounds on the
dynamic phase transition and prove that, above a certain threshold, a local
algorithm (belief propagation) correctly identify most of the hidden set. Below
the same threshold \emph{no local algorithm} can achieve this goal. However, in
this regime the subset can be identified by exhaustive search.
  For small hidden sets and large average degree, the phase transition for
local algorithms takes an intriguingly simple form. Local algorithms succeed
with high probability for ${\rm deg}_{\rm in} - {\rm deg}_{\rm out} >
\sqrt{{\rm deg}_{\rm out}/e}$ and fail for ${\rm deg}_{\rm in} - {\rm deg}_{\rm
out} < \sqrt{{\rm deg}_{\rm out}/e}$ (with ${\rm deg}_{\rm in}$, ${\rm
deg}_{\rm out}$ the average degrees inside and outside the community). We argue
that spectral algorithms are also ineffective in the latter regime.
  It is an open problem whether any polynomial time algorithms might succeed
for ${\rm deg}_{\rm in} - {\rm deg}_{\rm out} < \sqrt{{\rm deg}_{\rm out}/e}$.

$\gamma$-ray signatures for a low mass DM model. For this, we consider a simple
Higgs-portal DM model, namely, the inert Higgs doublet model (IHDM) where the
Standard Model is extended with an additional complex SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar.
The stability of the DM candidate in this model, i.e., the lightest neutral
scalar component of the extra doublet, is ensured by imposing discrete
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The reduced-$\chi^2$ analysis with the theoretical,
experimental and observational constraints suggests the best-fit value of DM
mass in this model to be $\sim$ 63.5 GeV. We analyse the anomalous GeV
$\gamma$-ray excess from Galactic Centre in light of the best-fit IHDM
parameters. We further check the consistency of the best-fit IHDM parameters
with the Fermi-LAT obtained limits on photon flux for 18 Milky Way dwarf
spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) known to be mostly dominated by DM. Also
since the $\gamma$-ray signal from DM annihilation is assumed to be embedded
within the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (EGB), the theoretical
calculations of photon flux for the best-fit parameter point in the IHDM
framework are compared with the Fermi-LAT results for diffuse and isotropic EGB
for different extragalactic and astrophysical background parametrisations. We
show that the low mass DM in IHDM framework can satisfactorily confront all the
observed continuum $\gamma$-ray fluxes originated from galactic as well as
extragalactic sources. The extensive analysis performed in this work is valid
for any Higgs-portal model with DM mass in the ballpark of that considered in

attention of researchers. These magnets are finite in size and contain very
large spins. They are interesting because they possess macroscopic quantum
tunneling of N\'eel vectors. For antiferromagnetic molecular nanomagnets with
finite number of even-numbered coupled spins, tunneling involves two classical
localized N\'eel ground states separated by a magnetic energy barrier. The
question is: can such phenomena be observed in nano magnets with odd number of
magnetic ions? The answer is not directly obvious because cyclic chains with
odd-numbered coupled spins are frustrated as one cannot obtain a perfect N\'eel
order. These frustrated spins can indeed be observed experimentally, so they
are of interest. In this Letter, we theoretically investigate macroscopic
quantum tunneling in these odd spin systems with arbitrary spins $s$, in the
presence of a magnetic field applied along the plane of the magnet. In contrast
to systems with an even-numbered coupled spins, the ground state of the cyclic
odd-spin system contains a topological soliton due to spin frustration. Thus
the classical ground state is $2N$-fold degenerate as the soliton can be placed
anywhere along the ring with total $S_z=\pm s$. Small quantum fluctuations
delocalize the soliton with a formation of an energy band. We obtain this
energy band using degenerate perturbation theory at order $2s$. We show that
the soliton ground state is chiral for half-odd integer spins and non-chiral
for integer spins. From the structure of the energy band we infer that as the
value of the spin increases the inelastic polarized neutron-scattering
intensity may increase or decrease depending on the strengths of the parameters
of the Hamiltonian.

derivation of the Dirac equation in Minkowski spacetime and which shows that
such famous equation express nothing more than the fact that the momentum of a
free particle is a constant vector field over timelike \ integral curves of a

\textbf{DHESS2}\ coincide. One of the main ingredients in our paper is the use
of the concept of Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields. Appendices B and C recall this

performed using a requirement on the number of jets, in combination with
separate requirements on the number of $b$-tagged jets, as well as a

large-radius jets in the event. Results are interpreted in the context of all
possible branching ratios of direct gluino decays to various quark flavors. No
significant deviation is observed from the expected Standard Model backgrounds
estimated using jet-counting as well as data-driven templates of the
total-jet-mass spectra. Gluino pair decays to ten or more quarks via
intermediate neutralinos are excluded for a gluino with mass $m_{\tilde{g}} <

group of metrics based (largely) on social media events relating to scholarly

active platforms, technical possibilities, and business models of aggregators
such as Altmetric.com, ImpactStory, PLOS, and Plum Analytics, and as such
constantly changing, this work refrains from defining an umbrella term for
these very heterogeneous new metrics. Instead a framework is presented that
describes acts leading to (online) events on which the metrics are based. These
activities occur in the context of social media, such as discussing on Twitter
or saving to Mendeley, as well as downloading and citing. The framework groups
various types of acts into three categories -- accessing, appraising, and
applying -- and provides examples of actions that lead to visibility and
traceability online. To improve the understanding of the acts, which result in
online events from which metrics are collected, select citation and social
theories are used to interpret the phenomena being measured. Citation theories
are used because the new metrics based on these events are supposed to replace

gamma rays originating from the center of our Galaxy. A possible explanation
for this excess is the annihilation of Dark Matter particles. We have
investigated the annihilation of neutralinos as Dark Matter candidates within
the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM). An
iterative particle filter approach was used to search for solutions within the
pMSSM. We found solutions that are consistent with astroparticle physics and
collider experiments, and provide a fit to the energy spectrum of the excess.
The neutralino is a Bino/Higgsino or Bino/Wino/Higgsino mixture with a mass in
the range $84-92$~GeV or $87-97$~GeV annihilating into W bosons. A third
solutions is found for a neutralino of mass $174-187$~GeV annihilating into top
quarks. The best solutions yield a Dark Matter relic density $0.06 < \Omega h^2
<0.13$. These pMSSM solutions make clear forecasts for LHC, direct and indirect
DM detection experiments. If the MSSM explanation of the excess seen by
Fermi-LAT is correct, a DM signal might be discovered soon.

conjecture that Galileons, and all theories incorporating the Vainshtein
mechanism, fall into Jaffe's class of `non-localizable' field theories
characterized by an exponential growth in their Kallen-Lehmann spectral
densities. Similar properties have been argued to arise for Little String
Theories and M-theory. For such theories, the notion of micro-causality and the
time ordering used to define the S-matrix and correlation functions must be
modified, and we give a Lorentz invariant prescription for how this can be
achieved. In common with General Relativity (GR), the scattering amplitudes for
Galileons are no longer expected to satisfy polynomial boundedness away from
the forward scattering or fixed physical momentum transfer limits. This is a
reflection of the fact that these theories are fundamentally gravitational and
not local field theories. We attribute this to the existence of a locality
bound for Galileons, analogous to the Giddings-Lippert locality bound for GR.
We utilize the recently developed Galileon duality to define a UV finite,
Lorentz invariant, quantization of a specific Galileon theory for which the
energy of all states are positive definite. We perform an explicit computation
of the Wightman functions for this theory, and demonstrate the exponential
growth associated with the locality bound. In analogy with GR, the bound is
correlated with the absence of Galileon Duality (i.e. Diffeomorphism) invariant
local observables. We argue that these theories can be quantized in a manner
which preserves Lorentz invariance and macro-causality and that the latter
ensures that the superluminalities found in the low energy effective theory are
absent in the full theory.

G29.96-0.02, G34.3+0.1, W49N and W51, detecting foreground absorption towards

In nine foreground absorption components detected towards these sources, the
inferred column densities of the four detected molecules showed relatively
constant ratios, with N(SH)/N(H$_2$S) in the range 1.1 - 3.0, N(CS)/N(H$_2$S)
in the range 0.32 - 0.61, and N(SO)/N(H$_2$S) in the range 0.08 - 0.30. The
observed SH/H$_2$ ratios - in the range (0.5-2.6) $\times 10^{-8}$ - indicate
that SH (and other sulphur-bearing molecules) account for << 1% of the
gas-phase sulphur nuclei. The observed abundances of sulphur-bearing molecules,
however, greatly exceed those predicted by standard models of cold diffuse
molecular clouds, providing further evidence for the enhancement of endothermic
reaction rates by elevated temperatures or ion-neutral drift. We have
considered the observed abundance ratios in the context of shock and turbulent
dissipation region (TDR) models. Using the TDR model, we find that the
turbulent energy available at large scale in the diffuse ISM is sufficient to
explain the observed column densities of SH and CS. Standard shock and TDR
models, however, fail to reproduce the column densities of H$_2$S and SO by a
factor of about 10; more elaborate shock models - in which account is taken of
the velocity drift, relative to H$_2$, of SH molecules produced by the
dissociative recombination of H$_3$S$^+$ - reduce this discrepancy to a factor

mass of MWs increases in self-similar way, irrespective of the radial distance,
while that of MGs grows in inside-out way where they obtain ~ 75% of the total
mass at outer (> 2.5 kpc) radius since z ~ 2. Although the radial mass profiles
evolve in distinct ways, the formation and quenching of the central dense
region (or bulge) ahead of the outer disk formation are found to be common for
both systems. The sudden reddening of bulge at z ~ 1.6 and z ~ 2.4 for MWs and
MGs, respectively, suggests the formation of bulge and would give a clue to the
different gas accretion histories and quenching. A new approach to evaluate the
morphological diversity is conducted by using the average surface density
profile and its dispersion. The variety of the radial mass profiles for MGs
peaks at higher redshift (z > 2.8), and then rapidly converges to more uniform
shape at z < 1.5, while that for MWs remains in the outer region over the

appearance of astronomical sources. Averaged over a scattering ensemble, the
result is a blurred image of the source. However, Narayan & Goodman (1989) and
Goodman & Narayan (1989) showed that for an incomplete average, scattering
introduces refractive substructure in the image of a point source that is both
persistent and wideband. We show that this substructure is quenched but not
smoothed by an extended source. As a result, when the scatter-broadening is
comparable to or exceeds the unscattered source size, the scattering can
introduce spurious compact features into images. In addition, we derive
efficient strategies to numerically compute realistic scattered images, and we
present characteristic examples from simulations. Our results show that
refractive substructure is an important consideration for ongoing missions at

by the main-sequence components, which have earlier spectral types than the

ellipsoidally variable binaries with similar periods, near 4 hours, and
spectral types M2--3, which are very close to Roche-lobe filling. We also find
that the fraction of eclipsing systems is lower than found in previous studies

early M-type main-sequence stars due to their enhanced angular momentum loss
compared to fully convective late M type stars, hence causing them to become
cataclysmic variables quicker and disappear from the WDMS sample. Our systems
bring the total number of known detached, eclipsing WDMS binaries to 71.

  Independence","Submitted to ICALP 2015",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Randomized algorithms and data structures are often analyzed under the
assumption of access to a perfect source of randomness. The most fundamental
metric used to measure how ""random"" a hash function or a random number
generator is, is its independence: a sequence of random variables is said to be
$k$-independent if every variable is uniform and every size $k$ subset is
independent. In this paper we consider three classic algorithms under limited
independence. We provide new bounds for randomized quicksort, min-wise hashing
and largest bucket size under limited independence. Our results can be
summarized as follows.
  -Randomized quicksort. When pivot elements are computed using a
$5$-independent hash function, Karloff and Raghavan, J.ACM'93 showed $O ( n
\log n)$ expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort.
We improve upon this, showing that the same running time is achieved with only
$4$-independence.
  -Min-wise hashing. For a set $A$, consider the probability of a particular
element being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that
$5$-independence implies the optimal probability $O (1 /n)$. Broder et al.,
STOC'98 showed that $2$-independence implies it is $O(1 / \sqrt{|A|})$. We show
a matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for $3$- and $4$-independent
hash functions.
  -Largest bucket. We consider the case where $n$ balls are distributed to $n$
buckets using a $k$-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket
size. Alon et. al, STOC'97 showed that there exists a $2$-independent hash
function implying a bucket of size $\Omega ( n^{1/2})$. We generalize the
bound, providing a $k$-independent family of functions that imply size $\Omega
( n^{1/k})$.

(GW) for the future eLISA observatory. The detection and parameter estimation
of these sources to high redshift would provide invaluable information on the
formation mechanisms of seed black holes, and on the evolution of massive black
holes and their host galaxies through cosmic time. The Fisher information
matrix has been the standard tool for GW parameter estimation in the last two
decades. However, recent studies have questioned the validity of using the
Fisher matrix approach. For example, the Fisher matrix approach sometimes
predicts errors of $\geq100\%$ in the estimation of parameters such as the
luminosity distance and sky position. With advances in computing power,
Bayesian inference is beginning to replace the Fisher matrix approximation in
parameter estimation studies. In this work, we conduct a Bayesian inference
analysis for 120 sources situated at redshifts of between $0.1\leq z\leq 13.2$,
and compare the results with those from a Fisher matrix analysis. The Fisher
matrix results suggest that for this particular selection of sources, eLISA
would be unable to localize sources at redshifts of $z\lesssim6$. In contrast,
Bayesian inference provides finite error estimations for all sources in the
study, and shows that we can establish minimum closest distances for all
sources. The study further predicts that we should be capable with eLISA, out
to a redshift of at least $z\leq13$, of predicting a maximum error in the chirp
mass of $\lesssim 1\%$, the reduced mass of $\lesssim20\%$, the time to
coalescence of 2 hours, and to a redshift of $z\sim5$, the inclination of the
source with a maximum error of $\sim60$ degrees.

free energy F as a function of a translocation coordinate, s, defined to be the

consider the case of a driving force acting on monomers inside the pore, as
well as monomer attraction to the cavity wall. We examine the changes to F(s)
upon variation in the shape anisometry and volume of the cavity, the polymer
length, and the strength of the interactions driving the insertion. For
athermal systems, the free energy functions are analyzed using a scaling
approach, where we treat the confined portion of the polymer to be in the
semi-dilute regime. The free energy functions are used with the Fokker-Planck
equation to measure mean translocation times, as well as translocation time
distributions. We find that both polymer ejection and insertion is faster for
ellipsoidal cavities than for spherical cavities. The results are in
qualitative agreement with those of a Langevin dynamics study in the case of
ejection but not for insertion. The discrepancy is likely due to
out-of-equilibrium conformational behaviour that is not accounted for in the FP

noise, which restricts the process of interpretation. Therefore the need for
speckle noise reduction techniques is of high importance. To the best of our
knowledge, use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques has never
been explored for speckle reduction of OCT images. Here, a comparative study of
several ICA techniques (InfoMax, JADE, FastICA and SOBI) is provided for noise
reduction of retinal OCT images. Having multiple B-scans of the same location,
the eye movements are compensated using a rigid registration technique. Then,
different ICA techniques are applied to the aggregated set of B-scans for
extracting the noise-free image. Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR),
Contrast-to-Noise-Ratio (CNR) and Equivalent-Number-of-Looks (ENL), as well as
analysis on the computational complexity of the methods, are considered as
metrics for comparison. The results show that use of ICA can be beneficial,

benefits are often posed as control problems, in which at any point in the
solution domain, a control is able to take any one of an uncountable number of
values from the admissible set. Often, such contracts specify that the holder
exert control at a finite number of deterministic times. The existence of an
optimal bang-bang control, an optimal control taking on only a finite subset of
values from the admissible set, is a common assumption in the literature. In
this case, the numerical complexity of searching for an optimal control is
considerably reduced. However, no rigorous treatment as to when an optimal
bang-bang control exists is present in the literature. We provide the reader
with a bang-bang principle from which the existence of such a control can be
established for contracts satisfying some simple conditions. The bang-bang
principle relies on the convexity and monotonicity of the solution and is
developed using basic results in convex analysis and parabolic partial
differential equations. We show that a guaranteed lifelong withdrawal benefit
(GLWB) contract admits an optimal bang-bang control. In particular, we find
that the holder of a GLWB can maximize a writer's losses by only ever
performing nonwithdrawal, withdrawal at exactly the contract rate, or full
surrender. We demonstrate that the related guaranteed minimum withdrawal
benefit contract is not convexity preserving, and hence does not satisfy the
bang-bang principle other than in certain degenerate cases.

  Polylogarithmic States","11 pages",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Population protocols are networks of finite-state agents, interacting
randomly, and updating their states using simple rules. Despite their extreme
simplicity, these systems have been shown to cooperatively perform complex
computational tasks, such as simulating register machines to compute standard
arithmetic functions. The election of a unique leader agent is a key
requirement in such computational constructions. Yet, the fastest currently
known population protocol for electing a leader only has linear stabilization
time, and, it has recently been shown that no population protocol using a
constant number of states per node may overcome this linear bound.
  In this paper, we give the first population protocol for leader election with
polylogarithmic stabilization time, using polylogarithmic memory states per
node. The protocol structure is quite simple: each node has an associated
value, and is either a leader (still in contention) or a minion (following some
leader). A leader keeps incrementing its value and ""defeats"" other leaders in
one-to-one interactions, and will drop from contention and become a minion if
it meets a leader with higher value. Importantly, a leader also drops out if it
meets a minion with higher absolute value. While these rules are quite simple,
the proof that this algorithm achieves polylogarithmic stabilization time is
non-trivial. In particular, the argument combines careful use of concentration
inequalities with anti-concentration bounds, showing that the leaders' values
become spread apart as the execution progresses, which in turn implies that
straggling leaders get quickly eliminated. We complement our analysis with
empirical results, showing that our protocol stabilizes extremely fast, even
for large network sizes.

planet population. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is
certainly not representative of the general population of planets in our Milky
Way. The key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:
What are exoplanets made of? Why are planets as they are? What causes the
exceptional diversity observed as compared to the Solar System?
  EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) has been designed as a
dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of
observing a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year mission
lifetime. EChO can target the atmospheres of super-Earths, Neptune-like, and
Jupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures
of 300K-3000K) of F to M-type host stars. Over the next ten years, several new
ground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS,
TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.
The current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be further
optimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric
characterisation of hundreds of planets. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a
cold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard to
allow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed over
the sky. A 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary
spectro-photometric precision. The spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16
micron) and SNR to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and
dedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmospheric
composition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

presented. It is shown that nanocrystalline graphene stands fairly high doses
of ion irradiation (up to 3e14 cm-2 of 5 to 50 keV Ga+ ions) without
degradation in conductance. At higher doses, nanocrystalline graphene rapidly
loses its conductance and at doses over 2e15 cm-2 becomes actually insulating.
Annealing in vacuum restores conductance of the irradiated nanocrystalline
graphene and, if the irradiation has not exceeded a dose of 3e15 cm-2, this
restoration can be complete. Ion irradiation at high doses approaching 1e16
cm-2 results in complete ion sputtering of a few layer graphene. Along with the
irradiation-induced reduction of conductance and the temperature-induced
restoration of conductance, two other effects of the ion irradiation are the
enhancement of adhesion of graphene to substrate and the increase in the
nucleation capability of substrate for direct deposition of graphene. For 50
keV Ga+ ions, the enhancement of adhesion is observed at irradiation doses over
2e14 cm-2. The promoted graphene nucleation is observed in a broad dose range.
It is shown that the above effects can be used for development of methods of

different directions, revealing a more detailed picture of the emitting source
in these collisions at increasing energies. The measurements are performed for
different intervals of the pair average transverse momentum, kT, and for
increasing charged particle multiplicitiy, Nch. Results in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D
show a decrease of the fit radius parameters with kT, whereas a clear rise with
Nch is observed in all cases. In addition, the fit radius parameters at both

  parabolic counterpart of a conjecture of De Giorgi",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We continue the study of Modica type gradient estimates for non-homogeneous
parabolic equations initiated in \cite{BG}. First, we show that for the
parabolic minimal surface equation with a semilinear force term if a certain
gradient estimate is satisfied at $t=0$, then it holds for all later times
$t>0$. We then establish analogous results for reaction-diffusion equations
such as \eqref{e0} below in $\Om \times [0, T]$, where $\Om$ is an epigraph
such that the mean curvature of $\partial \Om$ is nonnegative.
  We then turn our attention to settings where such gradient estimates are
valid without any a priori information on whether the estimate holds at some
earlier time. Quite remarkably (see Theorem \ref{main3}, Theorem \ref{main5}
and Theorem \ref{T:ricci}), this is is true for $\Rn \times (-\infty, 0]$ and
$\Om \times (-\infty, 0]$, where $\Om$ is an epigraph satisfying the geometric
assumption mentioned above, and for $M \times (-\infty,0]$, where $M$ is a
connected, compact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci tensor. As a
consequence of the gradient estimate \eqref{mo2}, we establish a rigidity
result (see Theorem \ref{main6} below) for solutions to \eqref{e0} which is the
analogue of Theorem 5.1 in \cite{CGS}. Finally, motivated by Theorem
\ref{main6}, we close the paper by proposing a parabolic version of the famous
conjecture of De Giorgi also known as the $\ve$-version of the Bernstein
theorem.

role in the emergence of life on Earth. While this molecule has been observed
in space, most of its detections correspond to high-mass star-forming regions.
Motivated by this lack of investigation in the low-mass regime, we searched for
formamide, as well as isocyanic acid (HNCO), in 10 low- and intermediate-mass
pre-stellar and protostellar objects. The present work is part of the IRAM
Large Programme ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM), which makes use of
unbiased broadband spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths. We detected HNCO
in all the sources and NH2CHO in five of them. We derived their abundances and
analysed them together with those reported in the literature for high-mass
sources. For those sources with formamide detection, we found a tight and
almost linear correlation between HNCO and NH2CHO abundances, with their ratio
being roughly constant -between 3 and 10- across 6 orders of magnitude in
luminosity. This suggests the two species are chemically related. The sources
without formamide detection, which are also the coldest and devoid of hot
corinos, fall well off the correlation, displaying a much larger amount of HNCO
relative to NH2CHO. Our results suggest that, while HNCO can be formed in the
gas phase during the cold stages of star formation, NH2CHO forms most
efficiently on the mantles of dust grains at these temperatures, where it
remains frozen until the temperature rises enough to sublimate the icy grain
mantles. We propose hydrogenation of HNCO as a likely formation route leading
to NH2CHO.

their linear dispersion relation and two-band nature. Although the transport
phenomena of Dirac electrons in a normal state have intensively been studied,
the transport phenomena in a superconducting state have not been fully
understood. In particular, it is not clear whether Dirac electrons in a
superconducting state show Meissner effect (ME), since a diamagnetic term of a
current operator is absent as a result of the linear dispersion. We investigate
the ME of three dimensional massive Dirac electrons in a superconducting state
on the basis of Kubo formula, and clarify that Meissner kernel becomes finite
by use of the inter-band contribution. This mechanism of the ME for Dirac
electrons is completely different from that for the electrons in usual metals.
Our result shows that the Meissner kernel remains finite even when the
superconducting gap vanishes. This is an unavoidable problem in the Dirac
electron system as reported in the previous works. Thus, we use a prescription
in which we subtract the normal state contribution. In order to justify this
prescription, we develop a specific model where the Meissner kernel is obtained
by the prescription. We also derive the result for the electron gas by taking
the non-relativistic limit of Dirac Hamiltonian, and clarify that the
diamagnetic term of the Meissner kernel can be regarded as the inter-band
contribution between electrons and positrons in terms of the Dirac model.

Accepted in Advances in Math",,,,"math.RT math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to a well-known theorem of Brieskorn and Slodowy, the intersection
of the nilpotent cone of a simple Lie algebra with a transverse slice to the
subregular nilpotent orbit is a simple surface singularity. At the opposite
extremity of the nilpotent cone, the closure of the minimal nilpotent orbit is
also an isolated symplectic singularity, called a minimal singularity. For
classical Lie algebras, Kraft and Procesi showed that these two types of
singularities suffice to describe all generic singularities of nilpotent orbit
closures: specifically, any such singularity is either a simple surface
singularity, a minimal singularity, or a union of two simple surface
singularities of type $A_{2k-1}$. In the present paper, we complete the picture
by determining the generic singularities of all nilpotent orbit closures in
exceptional Lie algebras (up to normalization in a few cases). We summarize the
results in some graphs at the end of the paper.
  In most cases, we also obtain simple surface singularities or minimal
singularities, though often with more complicated branching than occurs in the
classical types. There are, however, six singularities which do not occur in
the classical types. Three of these are unibranch non-normal singularities: an
$SL_2(\mathbb C)$-variety whose normalization is ${\mathbb A}^2$, an
$Sp_4(\mathbb C)$-variety whose normalization is ${\mathbb A}^4$, and a
two-dimensional variety whose normalization is the simple surface singularity
$A_3$. In addition, there are three 4-dimensional isolated singularities each
appearing once. We also study an intrinsic symmetry action on the
singularities, in analogy with Slodowy's work for the regular nilpotent orbit.

`unitarization' is generically necessary to maintain the unitarity. We

analyze the system operating under the proposed schemes as $N \to \infty$ which

within servers of the same type. We further establish the existence and
uniqueness of stationary solution of the mean field and show that the tail

to investigate the signatures of their magnetic activity and dynamos.
Spectropolarimetry enables the study of these stellar magnetic fields and was
thus employed at the T\'{e}lescope Bernard Lyot and the Anglo-Australian
Telescope to investigate two moderately rotating young Sun-like stars, namely
HD 35296 (V119 Tau, HIP 25278) and HD 29615 (HIP 21632). The results indicate
that both stars display rotational variation in chromospheric indices
consistent with their spot activity, with variations indicating a probable
long-term cyclic period for HD 35296. Additionally, both stars have complex,
and evolving, large-scale surface magnetic fields with a significant toroidal
component. High levels of surface differential rotation were measured for both
stars. For the F8V star HD 35296 a rotational shear of $\Delta\Omega$ =
0.22$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ rad/d was derived from the observed magnetic profiles.
For the G3V star HD 29615 the magnetic features indicate a rotational shear of
$\Delta\Omega$ = 0.48$_{-0.12}^{+0.11}$ rad/d, while the spot features, with a
distinctive polar spot, provide a much lower value of $\Delta\Omega$ of
0.07$_{-0.03}^{+0.10}$ rad/d. Such a significant discrepancy in shear values
between spot and magnetic features for HD 29615 is an extreme example of the
variation observed for other lower-mass stars. From the extensive and
persistent azimuthal field observed for both targets it is concluded that a
distributed dynamo operates in these moderately rotating Sun-like stars, in
marked contrast to the Sun's interface-layer dynamo.

a massive black hole to be disrupted. About half the star's matter is given
elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, the other half is
unbound. To ""circularize"", i.e., to form an accretion flow, the bound matter
must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on
the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole's
gravitational radius ($\sim 10^{51} (R/1000R_g)^{-1}$~erg). Recent numerical
simulations \citep{Shiokawa+2015} have revealed that the circularization scale
is close to the scale of the most-bound initial orbits, $\sim 10^3

powers the observed optical TDE candidates. The observed rise times,

a consequence of the additional, time-dependent SOI. A detailed analysis shows
that this effect is due to the generation of harmonics of the driving

star-forming-dominated RLGs (SFGs), mainly occurring at redshifts of
$0.01<z<0.15$. RL AGNs and SFGs are separately distributed in the
([3.4]$-$[4.6])$-$([4.6]$-$[12]) two-colour diagram, in which the RL AGNs
display a double-core distribution, and the SFGs display a single-core
distribution. SFGs have a redder [4.6]$-$[12] colour than RL AGNs due to the
significant contribution from the dust component of SFGs. We find simple
criteria of MIR colour separation between RL AGNs and SFGs such that: 95$\%$ of
RL AGNs have [4.6]$-$[12] $<$ 3.0 and 94$\%$ of SFGs have [4.6]$-$[12] $>$ 3.0.
We also analyse the MIR colours of RL AGNs divided into low- and

numerical simulations of magnetised stellar winds, specific dynamo and
mass-loss rate prescriptions, as well as core/envelope decoupling. We compare
model predictions to the distributions of rotational periods measured for low
mass stars belonging to star forming regions and young open clusters.
Furthermore, we explore the mass dependence of model parameters by comparing
these new models to the solar-mass models we developed earlier. Rotational
evolution models are computed for slow, median, and fast rotators at each
stellar mass. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of
low-mass stars between 1 Myr and 8-10 Gyr, including pre-main sequence to
zero-age main sequence spin up, prompt zero-age main sequence spin down, and
early-main sequence convergence of the surface rotation rates. Fast rotators
are found to have systematically shorter disk lifetimes than moderate and slow
rotators, thus enabling dramatic pre-main sequence spin up. They also have
shorter core-envelope coupling timescales, i.e., more uniform internal
rotation. As to the mass dependence, lower mass stars require significantly
longer core-envelope coupling timescale than solar-type ones, which results in
strong differential rotation developing in the stellar interior on the early
main sequence. Lower mass stars also require a weaker braking torque to account
for their longer spin down timescale on the early main sequence, while they
ultimately converge towards lower rotational velocities than solar-type stars
on the longer term due to their reduced moment of inertia. We also find
evidence that the mass-dependence of the wind braking efficiency may be related
to a change of the magnetic topology in lower mass stars.

approximation of Narcowich, Petrushev and Ward is not computable, in that the

approximate these integrals by a second quadrature rule with an appropriate
degree of precision, to construct a fully discrete needlet approximation. We
prove that the resulting approximation is equivalent to filtered
hyperinterpolation, that is to a filtered Fourier-Laplace series partial sum
with inner products replaced by appropriate cubature sums. It follows that the
$\mathbb{L}_{p}$-error of discrete needlet approximation of order $J$ for $1

$\mathbb{W}_{p}^{s}(\mathbb{S}^{d})$ the optimal rate of convergence in the
sense of optimal recovery, namely $\mathcal{O}\bigl(2^{-J s}\bigr)$. Moreover,
this is achieved with a filter function that is of smoothness class $C^{\lfloor
\frac{d+3}{2}\rfloor}$, in contrast to the usually assumed $C^{\infty}$. A
numerical experiment for a class of functions in known Sobolev smoothness
classes gives $\mathbb{L}_2$ errors for the fully discrete needlet
approximation that are almost identical to those for the original semidiscrete
needlet approximation. Another experiment uses needlets over the whole sphere
for the lower levels together with high-level needlets with centers restricted
to a local region. The resulting errors are reduced in the local region away
from the boundary, indicating that local refinement in special regions is a
promising strategy.

the basis of random first-order transition (RFOT) theory, a new method to
measure the static correlation length of amorphous order, called ""point-to-set

grows much faster than the static length. Here we study the nature of the PTS
length, using a polydisperse hard disk system, which is a model that is known
to exhibit a growing hexatic order upon densification. We show that the PTS
correlation length is decoupled from the steeper increase of the correlation
length of hexatic order, while closely mirroring the decay length of two-body
density correlations. Our results thus provide a clear example that other forms
of order can play an important role in the slowing down of the dynamics,

spectral resources we consider the case of multiple operators sharing a common
pool of radio resources. Four algorithms are proposed to address co-primary
multi-operator radio resource sharing under heterogeneous traffic in both
centralized and distributed scenarios. The performance of these algorithms is
assessed through extensive system-level simulations for two indoor small cell
layouts. It is assumed that the spectral allocations of the small cells are
orthogonal to the macro network layer and thus, only the small cell traffic is
modeled. The main performance metrics are user throughput and the relative
amount of shared spectral resources. The numerical results demonstrate the
importance of coordination among co-primary operators for an optimal resource
sharing. Also, maximizing the spectrum sharing percentage generally improves
the achievable throughput gains over non-sharing.

spectra from extreme cases where a single physical component (stellar,
interstellar, or AGN) completely dominates the integrated mid-infrared
emission. We show that a linear combination of one template for each physical
component reproduces the observed IRS spectra of AGN hosts with unprecedented
fidelity for a template fitting method, with no need to model extinction
separately. We use full probability distribution functions to estimate
expectation values and uncertainties for observables, and find that the
decomposition results are robust against degeneracies. Furthermore, we compare
the AGN spectra derived from the spectral decomposition with sub-arcsecond
resolution nuclear photometry and spectroscopy from ground-based observations.
We find that the AGN component derived from the decomposition closely matches
the nuclear spectrum, with a 1-sigma dispersion of 0.12 dex in luminosity and
typical uncertainties of ~0.19 in the spectral index and ~0.1 in the silicate
strength. We conclude that the emission from the host galaxy can be reliably
removed from the IRS spectra of AGN. This allows for unbiased studies of the
AGN emission in intermediate and high redshift galaxies -currently inaccesible

the feature in emission increase by 20 and 50%, respectively, once the host

has a bimodal distribution when the feature is in emission, with about 65% of

in objects with mid-infrared (MIR) luminosity spanning over six orders of

have not yet been adopted in practice. This is due to additional cost of BFT in
terms of resources, protocol complexity and performance, compared with crash
fault-tolerance (CFT). This overhead of BFT comes from the assumption of a
powerful adversary that can fully control not only the Byzantine faulty
machines, but at the same time also the message delivery schedule across the
entire network, effectively inducing communication asynchrony and partitioning
otherwise correct machines at will. To many practitioners, however, such strong
attacks appear irrelevant.
  In this paper, we introduce cross fault tolerance or XFT, a novel approach to
building reliable and secure distributed systems and apply it to the classical
state-machine replication (SMR) problem. In short, an XFT SMR protocol provides
the reliability guarantees of widely used asynchronous CFT SMR protocols such
as Paxos and Raft, but also tolerates Byzantine faults in combination with
network asynchrony, as long as a majority of replicas are correct and
communicate synchronously. This allows the development of XFT systems at the
price of CFT (already paid for in practice), yet with strictly stronger
resilience than CFT --- sometimes even stronger than BFT itself.
  As a showcase for XFT, we present XPaxos, the first XFT SMR protocol, and
deploy it in a geo-replicated setting. Although it offers much stronger
resilience than CFT SMR at no extra resource cost, the performance of XPaxos
matches that of the state-of-the-art CFT protocols.

photoproduction in $pp$ collisions at LHC energies to probe the photon flux
associated to a ultrarelativistic proton. The total photon distribution is
expected to be given in terms of the elastic and inelastic components.
Distinctly from the elastic photon component which can be determined from the
elastic form factors, the magnitude of the inelastic component still is an open
question. We consider the current parametrizations for the photon distribution
of a proton and estimate the rapidity distributions and total cross sections
for the production of $J/\Psi$, $\Psi^{\prime}$ and $\Upsilon$ at LHC energies.
We demonstrate that the predictions associated to the inelastic contribution
are of the same order than those associated to the elastic one. Our results
implies that a dedicated experimental analysis of diffractive quarkonium
photoproduction with the tagging of the two protons in the final state can be
useful to constrain the magnitude of the inelastic component of the photon
distribution.

an identical object or category. More specifically, matching the common node
correspondences among graphs. This multi-graph matching problem involves two
ingredients affecting the overall accuracy: i) the local pairwise matching
affinity score among graphs; ii) the global matching consistency that measures
the uniqueness of the pairwise matching results by different chaining orders.
Previous studies typically either enforce the matching consistency constraints
in the beginning of iterative optimization, which may propagate matching error
both over iterations and across graph pairs; or separate affinity optimizing
and consistency regularization in two steps. This paper is motivated by the
observation that matching consistency can serve as a regularizer in the
affinity objective function when the function is biased due to noises or
inappropriate modeling. We propose multi-graph matching methods to incorporate
the two aspects by boosting the affinity score, meanwhile gradually infusing
the consistency as a regularizer. Furthermore, we propose a node-wise
consistency/affinity-driven mechanism to elicit the common inlier nodes out of
the irrelevant outliers. Extensive results on both synthetic and public image
datasets demonstrate the competency of the proposed algorithms.

these spectral behaviors of noise correlations are analyzed for two different

describe the spectral behavior of noise correlations between the laser modes,
it is of utmost importance to have a precise knowledge about the spectral
behavior of the pump noise, which is the dominant source of noise in the
frequency range of our interest (10 kHz to 35 MHz). Moreover, it is found that
the noise correlation also depends on how the spatially separated laser modes
of the DF-VECSEL intercept the noise from a multi-mode fiber-coupled laser
diode used for pumping both the laser modes. To this aim, a specific experiment
is reported, which aims at measuring the correlations between different spatial

separation and complete damage processes considered on a nonsmooth
time-dependent domain with mixed boundary conditions. The evolution of the
system is described by a \textit{degenerating} Cahn-Hilliard equation for the
concentration, a doubly nonlinear differential inclusion for the damage
variable and a \textit{degenerating} quasi-static balance equation for the
displacement field. All these equations are highly nonlinearly coupled. Because
of the doubly degenerating character of the system, the doubly nonlinear
differential inclusion and the nonsmooth domain, the structure of the model is
very complex from an analytical point of view.
  A novel approach is introduced for proving existence of weak solutions for
such degenerating coupled system. To this end, we first establish a suitable
notion of weak solutions, which consists of weak formulations of the diffusion
and the momentum balance equation, a variational inequality for the damage
process and a total energy inequality. To show existence of weak solutions,
several new ideas come into play. Various results on shrinking sets and its
corresponding local Sobolev spaces are used. It turns out that, for instance,
on open sets which shrink in time a quite satisfying analysis in Sobolev spaces
is possible. The presented analysis can handle highly nonsmooth regions where
complete damage takes place. To mention only one difficulty, infinitely many
completely damaged regions which are not connected with the Dirichlet boundary
may occur in arbitrary small time intervals.

to recent observational findings that SMGs do not exhibit any significant trend
between the redshift and (sub)mm flux density. For the combined AzTEC1-30
sample we derive a median redshift of $\tilde{z}=3.17\pm0.27$, consistent with

cloud performed as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt
Survey (GBS) with the SCUBA-2 instrument. We demonstrate methods for combining
these data with previous HARP CO, Herschel, and IRAM N$_{2}$H$^{+}$
observations in order to accurately quantify the properties of the SCUBA-2
sources in Ophiuchus. We produce a catalogue of all of the sources found by
SCUBA-2. We separate these into protostars and starless cores. We list all of
the starless cores and perform a full virial analysis, including external
pressure. This is the first time that external pressure has been included in
this level of detail. We find that the majority of our cores are either bound
or virialised. Gravitational energy and external pressure are on average of a
similar order of magnitude, but with some variation from region to region. We
find that cores in the Oph A region are gravitationally bound prestellar cores,
while cores in the Oph C and E regions are pressure-confined. We determine that
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ is a good tracer of the bound material of prestellar cores,
although we find some evidence for N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ freeze-out at the very
highest core densities. We find that non-thermal linewidths decrease
substantially between the gas traced by C$^{18}$O and that traced by
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, indicating the dissipation of turbulence at higher densities.
We find that the critical Bonnor-Ebert stability criterion is not a good
indicator of the boundedness of our cores. We detect the pre-brown dwarf
candidate Oph B-11 and find a flux density and mass consistent with previous
work. We discuss regional variations in the nature of the cores and find
further support for our previous hypothesis of a global evolutionary gradient
across the cloud from southwest to northeast, indicating sequential star
formation across the region.

to atomic spectra reported elsewhere, while the spectra obtained in the model
including nuclear motion are very different and dominated by extremely broad
absorption features. These broad absorption features are analyzed and their
relation to molecular dissociation investigated. The study of the hydrogen

three-dimensional hydrogen molecule including nuclear vibration. The spectrum
obtained from H$_2$ is compared to the result of a fixed-nuclei calculation. In
the attosecond transient absorption spectra of H$_2$ including nuclear motion
we find a rich absorption structure corresponding to population of different

very similar to atomic spectra. We find that light-induced structures at

Division Multiplex. These schemes termed Galois-field Division Multiplex (GDM)
are based on transforms for which there exists fast algorithms. They are also
convenient from the hardware viewpoint since they can be implemented by a
Digital Signal Processor. A new Efficient-bandwidth
code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) is introduced, which is based on
multilevel spread spectrum sequences over a Galois field. The primary advantage
of such schemes regarding classical multiple access digital schemes is their
better spectral efficiency. Galois-Fourier transforms contain some redundancy
and only cyclotomic coefficients are needed to be transmitted yielding compact
spectrum requirements.

sequences of bits generated from the differences between detection times of

deviations from Borel normality for photon-generated random number sequences

heterogeneous models favor ammonium hydrosulfide as the third component, while
horizontally uniform models favor the weak absorber. Both models rely on water
ice absorption to compensate for residual spectral gradients produced by

largely due to its low lattice thermal conductivity. The origin of the low
thermal conductivity has so far been speculative. Using multi-temperature
single crystal X-ray diffraction (9 - 400 K) and powder X-ray diffraction (300
- 725 K) measurements we characterized the volume expansion and the evolution
of structural properties with temperature and identify an increasingly
anharmonic behavior of the Zn atoms. From a combination of Raman spectroscopy
and first principles calculations of phonons we consolidate the presence of
low-energy optic modes with wavenumbers below 60 cm-1. Heat capacity
measurements between 2 and 400 K can be well described by a Debye-Einstein
model containing one Debye and two Einstein contributions with temperatures
{\Theta}D = 195K, {\Theta}E1 = 78 K and {\Theta}E2 = 277 K as well as a
significant contribution due to anharmonicity above 150 K. The presence of a
multitude of weakly dispersed low-energy optical modes (which couple with the
acoustic, heat carrying phonons) combined with anharmonic thermal behavior
provides an effective mechanism for low lattice thermal conductivity. The
peculiar vibrational properties of ZnSb are attributed to its chemical bonding
properties which are characterized by multicenter bonded structural entities.
We argue that the proposed mechanism to explain the low lattice thermal
conductivity of ZnSb might also control the thermoelectric properties of
electron poor semiconductors, such as Zn4Sb3, CdSb, Cd4Sb3, Cd13-xInyZn10, and
Zn5Sb4In2-x.

still a very challenging problem. We introduce a simple but powerful approach
to computing descriptors for object views that efficiently capture both the
object identity and 3D pose. By contrast with previous manifold-based
approaches, we can rely on the Euclidean distance to evaluate the similarity
between descriptors, and therefore use scalable Nearest Neighbor search methods
to efficiently handle a large number of objects under a large range of poses.
To achieve this, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to compute these
descriptors by enforcing simple similarity and dissimilarity constraints
between the descriptors. We show that our constraints nicely untangle the
images from different objects and different views into clusters that are not
only well-separated but also structured as the corresponding sets of poses: The
Euclidean distance between descriptors is large when the descriptors are from
different objects, and directly related to the distance between the poses when
the descriptors are from the same object. These important properties allow us
to outperform state-of-the-art object views representations on challenging RGB
and RGB-D data.

reasoning techniques like Gr\""obner basis computation. The idea of these
algorithms is to encode two graphs into a system of equations that are
satisfiable if and only if if the graphs are isomorphic, and then to (try to)
decide satisfiability of the system using, for example, the Gr\""obner basis
algorithm. In some cases this can be done in polynomial time, in particular, if
the equations admit a bounded degree refutation in an algebraic proof systems
such as Nullstellensatz or polynomial calculus. We prove linear lower bounds on
the polynomial calculus degree over all fields of characteristic different from
2 and also linear lower bounds for the degree of Positivstellensatz calculus
derivations.
  We compare this approach to recently studied linear and semidefinite
programming approaches to isomorphism testing, which are known to be related to
the combinatorial Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. We exactly characterise the
power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm in terms of an algebraic proof system
that lies between degree-k Nullstellensatz and degree-k polynomial calculus.

to elucidate the molecular interactions between the bioactive compounds & their
