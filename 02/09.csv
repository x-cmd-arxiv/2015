eigenvalue-decomposition of a matrix related to the beam matrix, and may be
applied to the case of 1, 2 or 3 particle degrees of freedom. For 2 degrees of

quantum tunneling, Faraday waves, Bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations, and the
control of new states of matter rely on time-periodic driving of the system. A
remarkable property of such driving is that it can induce the localized (bound)
states to resonantly couple to the continuum. Therefore experiments that allow
for enlightening and controlling the mechanisms underlying such coupling are of
paramount importance. We implement such an experiment in a special fiber optics
system characterized by a dispersion oscillating along the propagation
coordinate, which mimics ""time"". The quasi-momentum associated with such
periodic perturbation is responsible for the efficient coupling of energy from
the localized wave-packets sustained by the fiber nonlinearity into
free-running linear dispersive waves (continuum), at multiple resonant
frequencies. Remarkably, the observed resonances can be explained by means of a
unified approach, regardless of the fact that the localized state is a
soliton-like pulse or a shock front.

Stochastic Dual Newton Ascent (SDNA). Our method is dual in nature: in each

existing methods such as stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of
utilizing all curvature information contained in the examples, which leads to
striking improvements in both theory and practice - sometimes by orders of
magnitude. In the special case when an L2-regularizer is used in the primal,
the dual problem is a concave quadratic maximization problem plus a separable

a random principal submatrix of the Hessian of the quadratic function; whence
the name of the method. If, in addition, the loss functions are quadratic, our

are various. Generally, documents become long due to two different reasons -
verbosity and multi-topicality. First, verbosity means that the same topic is
repeatedly mentioned by terms related to the topic, so that term frequency is
more increased than the well-summarized one. Second, multi-topicality indicates
that a document has a broad discussion of multi-topics, rather than single
topic. Although these document characteristics should be differently handled,
all previous methods of term frequency normalization have ignored these
differences and have used a simplified length-driven approach which decreases
the term frequency by only the length of a document, causing an unreasonable
penalization. To attack this problem, we propose a novel TF normalization
method which is a type of partially-axiomatic approach. We first formulate two
formal constraints that the retrieval model should satisfy for documents having
verbose and multi-topicality characteristic, respectively. Then, we modify
language modeling approaches to better satisfy these two constraints, and
derive novel smoothing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed
method increases significantly the precision for keyword queries, and
substantially improves MAP (Mean Average Precision) for verbose queries.

optimal global objective function convergence rate, we show that FISTA is not
optimal for sparse optimization with respect to the local convergence rate. We
determine the locally optimal parameter choice for the I-FBS family. Finally we
propose a method which inherits the excellent global rate of FISTA but also has

a Black-Scholes risky asset. The optimization objective is to minimize the
probability of ruin. We show by new operators that the minimal ruin probability
function is a classical solution to the corresponding HJB equation. Asymptotic
behaviors of the optimal investment control policy and the minimal ruin
probability function are studied for low surplus levels with a general claim
size distribution. Some new asymptotic results for large surplus levels in the
case with exponential claim distributions are obtained. We consider two cases
of investment control - unconstrained investment and investment with a limited
amount.

  Applications","technical report",,,,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Soft real-time applications such as multimedia applications often show bursty
memory access patterns---regularly requiring a high memory bandwidth for a
short duration of time. Such a period is often critical for timely data
processing. Hence, we call it a memory-performance critical section.
Unfortunately, in multicore architecture, non-real-time applications on
different cores may also demand high memory bandwidth at the same time, which
can substantially increase the time spent on the memory performance critical
sections.
  In this paper, we present BWLOCK, user-level APIs and a memory bandwidth
control mechanism that can protect such memory performance critical sections of
soft real-time applications. BWLOCK provides simple lock like APIs to declare
memory-performance critical sections. If an application enters a
memory-performance critical section, the memory bandwidth control system then
dynamically limit other cores' memory access rates to protect memory
performance of the application until the critical section finishes.
  From case studies with real-world soft real-time applications, we found (1)
such memory-performance critical sections do exist and are often easy to
identify; and (2) applying BWLOCK for memory critical sections significantly
improve performance of the soft real-time applications at a small or no cost in
throughput of non real-time applications.

transmissions required to compute the parity of $N$ input bits with constant
error in a noisy communication network of $N$ randomly placed sensors, each
having one input bit and communicating with others using local transmissions
with power near the connectivity threshold. This result settles the lower bound
question left open by Ying, Srikant and Dullerud (WiOpt 06), who showed how the
sum of all the $N$ bits can be computed using $O(N \log\log N)$ transmissions.
The same lower bound has been shown to hold for a host of other functions
including majority by Dutta and Radhakrishnan (FOCS 2008).
  Most works on lower bounds for communication networks considered mostly the
full broadcast model without using the fact that the communication in real
networks is local, determined by the power of the transmitters. In fact, in
full broadcast networks computing parity needs $\theta(N)$ transmissions. To
obtain our lower bound we employ techniques developed by Goyal, Kindler and
Saks (FOCS 05), who showed lower bounds in the full broadcast model by reducing
the problem to a model of noisy decision trees. However, in order to capture
the limited range of transmissions in real sensor networks, we adapt their
definition of noisy decision trees and allow each node of the tree access to
only a limited part of the input. Our lower bound is obtained by exploiting
special properties of parity computations in such noisy decision trees.

to generalize this operation from a model-theoretic point of view, by defining

characterization of the well known AGM postulates given by Katsuno and
Mendelzon for propositional logic in terms of minimal change among
interpretations. Moreover, we study how to define revision, satisfying the AGM
postulates, from relaxation notions that have been first introduced in
description logics to define dissimilarity measures between concepts, and the
consequence of which is to relax the set of models of the old belief until it
becomes consistent with the new pieces of knowledge. We show how the proposed
general framework can be instantiated in different logics such as
propositional, first-order, description and Horn logics. In particular for
description logics, we introduce several concrete relaxation operators tailored
for the description logic $\ALC{}$ and its fragments $\EL{}$ and $\ELext{}$,

We report on currents generated when stresses are applied. Loading the center
of gabbro tiles, 30x30x0.9 cm$^3$, across a 5 cm diameter piston, leads to
positive currents flowing from the center to the unstressed edges. Changing the
constant rate of loading over 5 orders of magnitude from 0.2 kPa/s to 20 MPa/s
produces positive currents, which start to flow already at low stress levels,
<5 MPa. The currents increase as long as stresses increase. At constant load
they flow for hours, days, even weeks and months, slowly decreasing with time.
When stresses are removed, they rapidly disappear but can be made to reappear
upon reloading. These currents are consistent with the stress-activation of
peroxy defects, such as O$_3$Si-OO-SiO$_3$, in the matrix of rock-forming
minerals. The peroxy break-up leads to positive holes h$^{\bullet}$, i.e.
electronic states associated with O$^-$ in a matrix of O$^{2-}$, plus
electrons, e'. Propagating along the upper edge of the valence band, the holes
are able to flow from stressed to unstressed rock, traveling fast and far by
way of a phonon-assisted electron hopping mechanism using energy levels at the
upper edge of the valence band. Impacting the tile center leads to
h$^{\bullet}$ pulses, 4-6 ms long, flowing outward at ~100 m/sec at a current
equivalent to 1-2 x 10$^9$ A/km$^3$. Electrons, trapped in the broken peroxy
bonds, are also mobile, but only within the stressed volume.

rotations, odometers), it is not even known whether it holds for all
Jewett-Krieger models of such rotations. In this paper we show that it does, as
long as the model is at the same a topological extension. In particular, we
reestablish (after [AKL]) that regular Toeplitz systems satisfy Sarnak's
conjecture, and, as another consequence, so do all generalized Sturmian
subshifts (not only the classical Sturmian subshift). We also give an example
of an irregular Toeplitz subshift which fits our criterion. We give an example
of a model of an odometer which is not even Toeplitz (it is weakly mixing),
hence does not fit our criterion. However, for this example, we manage to
produce a separate proof of Sarnak's conjecture. Next, we provide a class of
Toeplitz sequences which fail Sarnak's conjecture (in a weak sense); all these
examples have positive entropy. Finally, we examine the example of a Toeplitz
sequence from [AKL] (which fails Sarnak's conjecture in the strong sense) and
prove that it has positive entropy, as well (this proof has been announced in
[AKL]). This paper can be considered a sequel to [AKL], it also fills some gaps

processing networks, using formal diffusion approximations under suitable
temporal and spatial scaling, by Brownian control problems (BCP) and their
equivalent workload formulations (EWF), has been developed by Harrison (1988).
This framework has been implemented in many works for constructing
asymptotically optimal control policies for a broad range of stochastic network
models. To date all asymptotic optimality results for such networks correspond
to settings where the solution of the EWF is a reflected Brownian motion in the
positive orthant with normal reflections. In this work we consider a well
studied stochastic network which is perhaps the simplest example of a model
with more than one dimensional workload process. In the regime considered here,
the singular control problem corresponding to the EWF does not have a simple
form explicit solution, however by considering an associated free boundary
problem one can give a representation for an optimal controlled process as a
two dimensional reflected Brownian motion in a Lipschitz domain whose boundary
is determined by the solution of the free boundary problem. Using the form of
the optimal solution we propose a sequence of control policies, given in terms
of suitable thresholds, for the scaled stochastic network control problems and
prove that this sequence of policies is asymptotically optimal. As suggested by
the solution of the EWF, the policy we propose requires a server to idle under
certain conditions which are specified in terms of the thresholds determined
from the free boundary.

function, the most dramatic change occurs when going from 1-ML to 2-ML. For
both bulk and few-layer Ca$_2$N and Sr$_2$N, the in-plane and out-of-plane real
components of their dielectric functions have different signs in an extended
frequency range covering the near infrared, indicating their potential
applications as indefinite media. We find that bulk Ca$_2$N and Sr$_2$N could
support surface plasmon modes in the near infrared range. Moreover,
tightly-bounded plasmon modes could exist in their few-layer structures. These

with previous observations of C2H and c-C3H2 at similar angular resolution and
new gas-phase chemical model predictions to constrain the dominant formation
mechanisms of small hydrocarbons in low-UV flux PDRs. We find that, at the peak
of the HCO emission (PDR position), the measured l-C3H+, C2H and c-C3H2
abundances are consistent with current gas-phase model predictions. However, in
the first PDR layers, at the 7.7 mum PAH band emission peak, which are more
exposed to the radiation field and where the density is lower, the C2H and
c-C3H2 abundances are underestimated by an order of magnitude. At this
position, the l-C3H+ abundance is also underpredicted by the model but only by
a factor of a few. In addition, contrary to the model predictions, l-C3H+ peaks
further out in the PDR than the other hydrocarbons, C2H and c-C3H2. This cannot
be explained by an excitation effect. Current gas-phase photochemical models
thus cannot explain the observed abundances of hydrocarbons, in particular in

invariants using affine constraints (i.e., polyhedral) to specify pre- and
post-conditions. The algorithm was implemented in two different ways, with and
without invariants using polyhedral, and the results were compared.
Experimental results show that both forms can handle a wide variety of safety
properties; however, the k-induction algorithm adopting polyhedral solves more
verification tasks, which demonstrate an improvement of the induction algorithm
effectiveness.

two-view dimension reduction due to its profound theoretical foundation and
success in practical applications. In respect of multi-view learning, however,
it is limited by its capability of only handling data represented by two-view
features, while in many real-world applications, the number of views is
frequently many more. Although the ad hoc way of simultaneously exploring all
possible pairs of features can numerically deal with multi-view data, it
ignores the high order statistics (correlation information) which can only be
discovered by simultaneously exploring all features.
  Therefore, in this work, we develop tensor CCA (TCCA) which straightforwardly
yet naturally generalizes CCA to handle the data of an arbitrary number of
views by analyzing the covariance tensor of the different views. TCCA aims to
directly maximize the canonical correlation of multiple (more than two) views.
Crucially, we prove that the multi-view canonical correlation maximization
problem is equivalent to finding the best rank-1 approximation of the data
covariance tensor, which can be solved efficiently using the well-known
alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm. As a consequence, the high order
correlation information contained in the different views is explored and thus a
more reliable common subspace shared by all features can be obtained. In
addition, a non-linear extension of TCCA is presented. Experiments on various
challenge tasks, including large scale biometric structure prediction, internet
advertisement classification and web image annotation, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Hele-Shaw channel has applications to two-dimensional interacting streamer
discharges which are aligned in a periodic array. In the streamer context, the
relevant regularisation on the interface is not provided by surface tension,
but instead has been postulated to involve a mechanism equivalent to kinetic
undercooling, which acts to penalise high velocities and prevent blow-up of the
unregularised solution. Previous asymptotic results for the Hele-Shaw finger
problem with kinetic undercooling suggest that for a given value of the kinetic
undercooling parameter, there is a discrete set of possible finger shapes, each
analytic at the nose and occupying a different fraction of the channel width.
In the limit in which the kinetic undercooling parameter vanishes, the fraction
for each family approaches 1/2, suggesting that this 'selection' of 1/2 by
kinetic undercooling is qualitatively similar to the well-known analogue with
surface tension. We treat the numerical problem of computing these
Saffman-Taylor fingers with kinetic undercooling, which turns out to be more
subtle than the analogue with surface tension, since kinetic undercooling
permits finger shapes which are corner-free but not analytic. We provide
numerical evidence for the selection mechanism by setting up a problem with
both kinetic undercooling and surface tension, and numerically taking the limit
that the surface tension vanishes.

Namely, we prove that the local topology at an irregular point $x$ has a

$c$, has no maximal element. Next, for a polynomial functions, we compute the
signature of the invariant lift of a parabolic cycle with respect to a certain
recurrent critical point. This signature, unlike the cases studied in
\cite{CCG}, has no maximal element. We show that all other irregular points,

instantiates the educational theory of Learning by Teaching. Soon after its
emergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over
scaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students
to take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA
design also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions
with students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of
believability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive
learning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA,
Affective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and
implement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with
students with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of
pedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory
to design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors
of students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to
learn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and
Affectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage
them to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can
interact with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the
agent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an
educator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent
can perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators
into the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system,
which can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a
natural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base.

and undamped classical harmonic oscillator, followed by an overview of the
quantum mechanical description of this system. A brief review of both the
classical and quantum autocorrelation functions (ACFs) and PSDs follow. We then
introduce a general method by which the kth-order PSD for the harmonic
oscillator can be calculated, where $k$ is any positive integer. This
formulation is verified by first reproducing the known results for the $k = 1$
case of the linear PSD. It is then extended to calculate the second-order PSD,
useful in the field of quantum measurement, corresponding to the $k = 2$ case
of the generalized method. In this process, damping is included into each of
the quantum linear and quadratic PSDs, producing realistic models for the PSDs
found in experiment. These quantum PSDs are shown to obey the correspondence
principle by matching with what was calculated for their classical counterparts
in the high temperature, high-Q limit. Finally, we demonstrate that our results
can be reproduced using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, providing an
independent check of our resultant PSDs.

asymmetric gamma kernel functions. The use of gamma kernels is fruitful due to
the fact that they are nonnegative, change their shape depending on the
position on the semi-axis and possess good boundary properties for a wide class
of densities. We find an optimal bandwidth of the kernel as a minimum of the
mean integrated squared error by dependent data with strong mixing. This
bandwidth differs from that proposed for the gamma kernel density estimation.
To this end, we derive the covariance of derivatives of the density and deduce
its upper bound. Finally, the obtained results are applied to the case of a
first-order autoregressive process with strong mixing. The accuracy of the

probing time is proposed and analyzed for cooperative wireless networks. Relay
selection has been introduced to solve the degraded bandwidth efficiency
problem in cooperative communication. Yet complete information of relay
channels often remain unavailable for complex networks which renders the
optimal selection strategies impossible for transmission source without probing
the relay channels. Particularly when the number of relay candidate is large,
even though probing all relay channels guarantees the finding of the best
relays at any time instant, the degradation of bandwidth efficiency due to
non-negligible probing times, which was often neglected in past literature, is
also significant. In this work, a stopping rule based relay selection strategy
is determined for the source node to decide when to stop the probing process
and choose one of the probed relays to cooperate with under wireless channels'
stochastic uncertainties. This relay selection strategy is further shown to
have a simple threshold structure. At the meantime, full diversity order and
high bandwidth efficiency can be achieved simultaneously. Both analytical and
simulation results are provided to verify the claims.

as the representation method within multi-instance learning framework, where a

of the quantized instances. We argue that for the data type of histogram, using
$L_2$ norm distance is not suitable, and propose to use the earth mover's
distance (EMD) instead of $L_2$ norm distance as a measure of the
reconstruction error. By minimizing the EMD between the histogram of a sample

method is developed, which is refereed as SC-EMD. We evaluate its performances

crosses the jet close to the central black hole. The study includes an
analytical treatment of the evolution of the envelop lost by the star within
the jet, and calculations of the related high-energy radiation.
  The model readily explains the day-long, variable on timescales of hours, GeV
gamma-ray flare from \c454, observed during November 2010 on top of a
weeks-long plateau. In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a
strong wind generated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal
particles accelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself
could be produced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the
initial impact of the jet. In the framework of the proposed scenario, the
observations constrain the key model parameters of the source, including the
mass of the central black hole: $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^9 M_{\odot}$, the total
jet power: $L_{\rm j}\simeq 10^{48}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, and the Doppler factor
of the gamma-ray emitting clouds, $\delta\simeq 20$. Whereas we do not specify
the particle acceleration mechanisms, the potential gamma-ray production
processes are discussed and compared in the context of the proposed model. We
argue that synchrotron radiation of protons has certain advantages compared to

Hurwitz spaces, which reflects the variation of the complex structure of the

generalized Weil-Petersson K\""ahler form on the Hurwitz space. This form turns
out to be the curvature of a Quillen metric on a determinant line bundle.
Alternatively, the generalized Weil-Petersson K\""ahler form can be
characterized as the curvature form of the hermitian metric on the Deligne
pairing of the relative canonical line bundle and the pull back of the
anti-canonical line bundle on ${\mathbb P}_1$. Replacing the projective line by
an arbitrary but fixed curve $Y$, we arrive at a generalized Hurwitz space with
similar properties. The determinant line bundle extends to a compactification
of the (generalized) Hurwitz space as a line bundle, and the Quillen metric
yields a singular hermitian metric on the compactification so that a power of
the determinant line bundle provides an embedding of the Hurwitz space in a

our result incorporates non-perturbative correction which could be important
when the AAV's WV is large. Within the Bayesian framework, we obtain also
elegant expressions for finite measurement strength and find that the
amplifier's noise in quantum measurement has no effect on the WVs. In

energy from 937 eV to 2000 eV. A time-dependent rate equation, implemented in
the detailed level accounting approximation, is utilized to study the dynamical
evolution of the level population and emission properties of the highly
transient plasmas. For x-ray pulses with photon energy in the range of 937-1030
eV, where $1s\rightarrow 2p$ resonance absorption from single core-hole (SCH)
states of neon charge states exist, inner-shell resonant absorption (IRA)
effects play important roles in the time evolution of population and DCH
spectroscopy. Such IRA physical effects are illustrated in detail by
investigating the interaction of x-ray pulses at a photon energy of 944 eV,
which corresponds to the $1s\rightarrow 2p$ resonant absorption from the SCH
states ($1s2s^22p^4$, $1s2s2p^5$ and $1s2p^6$) of Ne$^{3+}$. After averaging
over the space and time distribution of the x-ray pulses, DCH spectroscopy at

discussed, taking the DCH spectroscopy at 937 and 980 eV as examples. For
photon energy larger than 1362 eV, there are no resonance absorption in the
interaction, resulting in a similar physical picture of DCH spectroscopy. The
dominant DCH states are due to higher ionization stages of Ne$^{7+}$-Ne$^{9+}$,
while the DCH spectroscopy from lower charge states Ne$^{2+}$-Ne$^{6+}$ are
much weaker. With the increase of x-ray photon energy, the contributions from

decomposed into a Berge acyclic network of bounded arity cost functions, soft
local consistencies such as soft Directed or Virtual Arc Consistency can
directly emulate dynamic programming. These different approaches to

consequence of numerous reports on limited reproducibility of experimental
results. To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general
features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their
chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.
Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct
trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible
sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,
sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the
organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And
this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different
framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the
view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid
overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely
complemented. An increase of specification of experimental procedures is the
way for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system
may be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.

(WAOA2007 and Theory of Computing Systems 45(3), 2009), which is defined as
follows: ""Points"" are given online in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space one
by one. An algorithm creates a ""cluster,"" which is a $d$-dimensional rectangle.
The initial length of each edge of a cluster is 0. An algorithm can extend an
edge until it reaches unit length independently of other dimensions. The task
of an algorithm is to cover a new given point either by creating a new cluster
and assigning it to the point, or by extending edges of an existing cluster
created in past times. The goal is to minimize the total number of created
clusters. Chan and Zarrabi-Zadeh proposed some method to obtain a competitive
algorithm for the $d$-dimensional case using an algorithm for the
one-dimensional case, and thus the one-dimensional case has been extensively
studied including some variants of the unit clustering problem. In this paper,
we show a lower bound of $13/8 = 1.625$ on the competitive ratio of any
deterministic online algorithm for the one-dimensional unit clustering,

increases the predictive power, in the most general case one has the same

what is the least integer $t=t(n,H)$ so that adding $t$ edges to any $n$-vertex
tournament, results in a digraph containing a copy of $H$. Similarly, what is
the least integer $t=t(T_n,H)$ so that adding $t$ edges to the $n$-vertex
transitive tournament, results in a digraph containing a copy of $H$. Besides
proving several results on these problems, our main contributions are the
following:
  (1) Pach and Tardos conjectured that if $M$ is an acyclic $0/1$ matrix, then
any $n \times n$ matrix with $n(\log n)^{O(1)}$ entries equal to $1$ contains
the pattern $M$. We show that this conjecture is equivalent to the assertion
that $t(T_n,H)=n(\log n)^{O(1)}$ if and only if $H$ belongs to a certain
(natural) family of tournaments.
  (2) We propose an approach for determining if $t(n,H)=n(\log n)^{O(1)}$. This
approach combines expansion in sparse graphs, together with certain structural
characterizations of $H$-free tournaments.
  Our result opens the door for using structural graph theoretic tools in order
to settle the Pach-Tardos conjecture.

selectivity is entirely based on developmental self-organization, and as such
it predicts that the metric it expresses should reflect the environment to
which the animal has adapted. We show that, according to self-organizing
models, if raised in a non-Euclidean hyperbolic cage rats should be able to
form hyperbolic grids. For a given range of grid spacing relative to the radius
of negative curvature of the hyperbolic surface, such grids are predicted to
appear as multi-peaked firing maps, in which each peak has seven neighbours
instead of the Euclidean six, a prediction that can be tested in experiments.
We thus demonstrate that a useful universal neuronal metric, in the sense of a

modelled by means of oscillating force multipoles at the cell-substrate

naturally `emerge' from long range mechanical interactions between oscillating
units, mediated both by the intracellular medium and the substrate. However,
the harnessing of cell polarisation for motility requires substrate-mediated
interactions. Motility can be optimised by adapting the oscillation frequency
to the relaxation time of the system or when the substrate and cell viscosities
match. Cellular noise can destroy mechanical coordination between
force-generating elements within the cell, resulting in sudden changes of
polarisation. The persistence of the cell's motion is found to depend on the
cell size and the substrate viscosity. Within such a model, chemotactic
guidance of cell motion is obtained by directionally modulating the persistence
of motion, rather than by modulating the instantaneous cell velocity, in a way
that resembles the run and tumble chemotaxis of bacteria.

and it has applications in many research areas. The PC algorithm is the
state-of-the-art constraint based method for causal discovery. However, runtime
of the PC algorithm, in the worst-case, is exponential to the number of nodes
(variables), and thus it is inefficient when being applied to high dimensional
data, e.g. gene expression datasets. On another note, the advancement of
computer hardware in the last decade has resulted in the widespread
availability of multi-core personal computers. There is a significant
motivation for designing a parallelised PC algorithm that is suitable for
personal computers and does not require end users' parallel computing knowledge
beyond their competency in using the PC algorithm. In this paper, we develop
parallel-PC, a fast and memory efficient PC algorithm using the parallel
computing technique. We apply our method to a range of synthetic and real-world
high dimensional datasets. Experimental results on a dataset from the DREAM 5
challenge show that the original PC algorithm could not produce any results
after running more than 24 hours; meanwhile, our parallel-PC algorithm managed
to finish within around 12 hours with a 4-core CPU computer, and less than 6
hours with a 8-core CPU computer. Furthermore, we integrate parallel-PC into a
causal inference method for inferring miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. The

the one- and two-particle transfer amplitudes of the spin-excitations among the

structures of the cytoskeletons underlying the lipid bi-layer. Among various
cell types, the Red Blood Cell (RBC) possesses a relatively simple cytoskeletal
structure. Underneath the membrane, the RBC cytoskeleton takes the form of a
two dimensional triangular network, consisting of nodes of actins (and other
proteins) and edges of spectrins. Recent experiments focusing on the malaria
infected RBCs (iRBCs) showed that there is a correlation between the elongation
of spectrins in the cytoskeletal network and the stiffening of the iRBCs. Here
we rationalize the correlation between these two observations by combining the
worm-like chain (WLC) model for single spectrins and the Effective Medium
Theory (EMT) for the network elasticity. We specifically focus on how the
disorders in the cytoskeletal network affect its macroscopic elasticity.
Analytical and numerical solutions from our model reveal that the stiffness of
the membrane increases with increasing end-to-end distances of spectrins, but
has a non-monotonic dependence on the variance of the end-to-end distance
distributions. These predictions are verified quantitively by our AFM and
micropipette aspiration measurements of iRBCs. The model may, from a molecular
level, provide guidelines for future identification of new treatment methods
for RBC related diseases, such as malaria infection.

The objectives of the developed algorithm are twofold. The first one is to find
a trajectory in the configuration space of a mobile manipulator so as to follow
a given trajectory in the task space. The second objective consists in locally
adjusting the trajectory in the configuration space in order to avoid
collisions with potentially moving obstacles and self-collisions in
unstructured and dynamic environments. The perception is exclusively based on a
set of proximity sensors distributed on the robot mechanical structure and
visual information are not required. Thanks to the adoption of this kind of
proximity distributed perception, the approach does not require a 3D model of
the robot and allows the real-time collision avoidance without the need of a
sensorized environment. To achieve the features cited above, a behaviour-based
technique known as Null-Space-Based (NSB) approach has been adopted with some
modifications.On one hand, the concept of a total pseudo-energy based on the
information from the distributed sensors has been introduced. On the other
hand, a method to combine different tasks has been proposed to guarantee the
smoothness of the realtime trajectory adjustments. Another significant feature
of the method is the strict coordination between the base and the arm
exploiting the redundant degrees of freedom, that is a relevant topic in mobile
manipulation.

(CSPs), that is, a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously.
Constraints can either be represented extensionally, by explicitly listing
allowed combinations of values, or implicitly, by special-purpose algorithms
provided by a solver.
  Such implicitly represented constraints, known as global constraints, are
widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of
constraint programming in solving real-world problems. In recent years, a
variety of restrictions on the structure of CSP instances have been shown to
yield tractable classes of CSPs. However, most such restrictions fail to
guarantee tractability for CSPs with global constraints. We therefore study the
applicability of structural restrictions to instances with such constraints.
  We show that when the number of solutions to a CSP instance is bounded in key
parts of the problem, structural restrictions can be used to derive new
tractable classes. Furthermore, we show that this result extends to
combinations of instances drawn from known tractable classes, as well as to CSP
instances where constraints assign costs to satisfying assignments.

maximizes the value of $n$. In this work, we present explicit construction of

construction has the property that the servers are almost regular, i.e., number
of data items stored in each server is in the range $[{nc \over

construction is obtained through better analysis and derandomization of the
randomized construction presented by Ishai et al. Analysis reveals almost
regularity of the servers, an aspect that so far has not been addressed in the
literature. The derandomization leads to explicit construction for a wide range
of values of $c$ (for given $m$ and $k$) where no other explicit construction

essentially quadratic in specific degree bounds on an incidence variety. We

hidden layer size is adaptive and can grow during training. This is obtained by
first extending the RBM to be sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units.
Then, thanks to a carefully chosen definition of the energy function, we show
that the limit of infinitely many hidden units is well defined. As with RBM,
approximate maximum likelihood training can be performed, resulting in an
algorithm that naturally and adaptively adds trained hidden units during
learning. We empirically study the behaviour of this infinite RBM, showing that
its performance is competitive to that of the RBM, while not requiring the
tuning of a hidden layer size.

various problems in graphs. It is well known that it takes $O(m+n)$ time to

undergoing {\em updates} (insertion and deletion of vertices or edges). We
present the following results for this problem.
  (a) Fault tolerant DFS tree: There exists a data structure of size ${O}(m
~polylog~ n)$ such that given any set ${\cal F}$ of failed vertices or edges, a
DFS tree of the graph $G\setminus {\cal F}$ can be reported in ${O}(n|{\cal F}|

  (b) Fully dynamic DFS tree: There exists a fully dynamic algorithm for
maintaining a DFS tree that takes worst case ${O}(\sqrt{mn} ~polylog~ n)$ time
per update for any arbitrary online sequence of updates.
  (c) Incremental DFS tree: Given any arbitrary online sequence of edge
insertions, we can maintain a DFS tree in ${O}(n ~polylog~ n)$ worst case time

$o(m)$ worst case update time for the dynamic subgraph connectivity,
biconnectivity, and 2-edge connectivity.

generate optimization problems with a wide spectrum of `classical hardness',

much larger than the observation dimension. However, in the small sample size
regime, the performance degrades. Recently, based on random matrix theory
results, a new subspace estimator was introduced, which was shown to be
consistent in the asymptotic regime where the number of samples and the
observation dimension converge to infinity at the same rate. In practice, this
estimator outperforms the traditional ones even for certain scenarios where the
observation dimension is small and of the same order of magnitude as the number

monitoring how the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of
orbits composing the main regular families evolve when energy varies. In
particular, we conduct a thorough numerical investigation distinguishing
between ordered and chaotic orbits, considering only bounded motion for several
energy levels. The smaller alignment index (SALI) was computed by numerically
integrating the equations of motion as well as the variational equations to
extensive samples of orbits in order to distinguish safely between ordered and
chaotic motion. In addition, a method based on the concept of spectral dynamics
that utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is
used to identify the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize
the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Our exploration takes place
both in the physical $(x,y)$ and the phase $(y,\dot{y})$ space for a better
understanding of the orbital properties of the system. It was found, that for
low energy levels the motion is entirely regular being the box orbits the most
populated family, while as the value of the energy increases chaos and several
resonant families appear. We also observed, that the vast majority of the
resonant orbits belong in fact in bifurcated families of the main 1:1 resonant
family. We have also compared our results with previous similar outcomes

develop and evaluate pedotransfer functions for the SWRC and SHC, respectively,

the residuals. However, when data for several SOC drivers were included, the
standalone BRT model predictions were not significantly improved by
geostatistical modelling. Therefore, in this latter situation, the BRT
predictions might be considered adequate without the need for geostatistical
modelling, provided that i) care is exercised in model fitting and validating,

both the jet emission and the accretion disk radiation can be observed, in
order to investigate the correlations among their jet power (P_jet), accretion
disk luminosity (L_disk), and luminosity of broad line region (BLR, L_BLR). On
the basis of the SED fits with the jet radiation and accretion disk radiation
models, we calculate P_jet and L_disk. No correlation between P_jet with either
L_disk or L_BLR is found. With a sub-sample of L_BLR for 13 GeV FSRQs, it is
observed that L_BLR is strongly correlated with their L_disk. We also study the
BLR covering factors of the GeV FSRQs in our sample, averagely which are
smaller than that of the large samples of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars.
P_jet of some GeV FSRQs is higher than L_disk, but P_jet of all the GeV FSRQs
is lower than the accretion power of black hole (BH), which is estimated by
\dot{M}c^2=L_disk/0.1, indicating that the total accretion power of BH is
sufficient to drive the jets in these sources; however the uncorrelation
between L_disk and P_jet of the GeV FSRQs may suggest that their jets are
launched by the BZ process via extracting the rotational energy of BH. Using
the L_BLR-L_disk relation of the GeV FSRQs, we estimate L_disk of a BL Lac
sample with their L_BLR. A comparison of L_BLR and Eddington ratio
(L_disk/L_Edd) among BL Lacs, very radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, and FSRQs is also
presented. It is found that along with the BL Lac-NLS1-FSRQ sequence L_BLR and
L_disk/L_Edd increase, which may correspond to the change of the accretion disk
structure and the transformation of the dominant mechanism for jet launching.
This is also consistent with the division of their parent populations, i.e.,
low-excitation radio galaxies and high-excitation radio galaxies.

than $1/2$ has no unbounded Fatou components. It is known that, for such

to show that they can also have no unbounded wandering domains. Here we
introduce completely new techniques to show that the conjecture holds in the
case that the transcendental entire function is real with only real zeros, and
we prove the much stronger result that such a function has no orbits of
unbounded wandering domains whenever the order is less than 1. This raises the
question as to whether such wandering domains can exist for any transcendental
entire function with order less than 1.
  Key ingredients of our proofs are new results in classical complex analysis
with wider applications. These new results concern: the winding properties of
the images of certain curves proved using extremal length arguments, growth
estimates for entire functions, and the distribution of the zeros of entire
functions of order less than 1.

isolated functional unit of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher
plants.Despite the lack of a decisive energy gradient in C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$, we
show that the energy transfer is directed by relaxation to low energy states.
C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ is not organized to form pathways with strict energetic
downhill transfer, which has direct consequences on the transfer efficiency,
transfer pathways and transfer limiting steps. The exciton dynamics is
sensitive to small structural changes, which, for instance, are induced by the
reorganization of vibrational coordinates. In order to incorporate the
reorganization process in our numerical simulations, we go beyond rate
equations and use the hierarchically coupled equation of motion approach
(HEOM). While transfer from the peripherical antenna to the proteins in
proximity to the reaction center occurs on a faster time scale, the final step
of the energy transfer to the RC core is rather slow, and thus the limiting
step in the transfer chain. Our findings suggest that the structure of the
PS-II supercomplex guarantees photoprotection rather than optimized efficiency.
