meet-completions for isotone poset expansions. With this method we find a
meet-completion for ordered domain algebras which simultaneously serves as the
base of a representation for such algebras, thereby proving that ordered domain
algebras have the finite representation property. We show that many of the
equations defining ordered domain algebras are preserved in this completion but
associativity, (D2) and (D6) can fail.

equilibrium are mutually incompatible in stars. The Sun's internal rotation is
far from barotropic, however, which allows at least the theoretical possibility
that the Sun's thermal balance is one of radiative equilibrium in the region of
the tachocline near the outer boundary of the radiative zone. We show here that
(i) the constraint of radiative equilibrium leads to a straightforward ordinary
differential equation for the Sun's rotation profile, and (ii) solutions of
this equation can be found that, to within current levels of accuracy, closely
resemble the rotation profile deduced from helioseismology. More generally, we
calculate how large a baroclinic deviation from uniform rotation is required to
maintain radiative equilibrium without meridional circulation throughout the
bulk of the radiative zone. Very little deviation is required, well below
detectability. The feasibility of radiative equilibrium for the tachocline
suggests that the issue of a spreading boundary layer may be less severe than
previously thought.

mixing ratio declined from about 4% at low latitudes to about 2% at 60 deg N
and beyond. This is similar to that found in the south polar regions in 2002,
in spite of what appears to be strikingly different convective activity in the
two regions. Keck and HST imaging observations close to equinox imply that the
depletions were simultaneously present in 2007, suggesting they are persistent
features. The depletions appear to be mainly restricted to the upper
troposphere, with depth increasing poleward from about 30 deg N, reaching ~4
bars at 45 deg N and perhaps much deeper at 70 deg N. The latitudinal
variations in degree and depth of the depletions are important constraints on
models of meridional circulation. Our observations are qualitatively consistent
with previously suggested circulation cells in which rising methane-rich gas at
low latitudes is dried out by condensation and sedimentation of methane ice
particles as the gas ascends to altitudes above the methane condensation level,
then is transported to high latitudes, where it descends and brings down
methane depleted gas. Since this cell would seem to inhibit formation of
condensation clouds in regions where clouds are actually inferred from spectral
modelling, it suggests that sparse localized convective events may be important
in cloud formation. The small-scale latitudinal variations we found in the
effective methane mixing ratio between 55 deg N and 82 deg N have significant
inverse correlations with zonal mean latitudinal variations in cloud
reflectivity in near-IR Keck images taken before and after the HST
observations. If the CH4/H2 absorption ratio variations are interpreted as
local variations in para fraction instead of methane mixing ratio, we find that
downwelling correlates with reduced cloud reflectivity.

spin-based technology including magnetic random access memory, nanoscale
microwave sources, and ultra-low power signal transfer. Future engineering
advances and new scientific discoveries will be enabled by research tools
capable of examining local magnetization dynamics at length and time scales
fundamental to spatiotemporal variations in magnetic systems - typically 10 -
200 nm and 5 - 50 ps. A key problem is that current table-top magnetic
microscopy cannot access both of these scales simultaneously. In this letter,
we introduce a spatiotemporal magnetic microscopy that uses
magneto-thermoelectric interactions to measure local magnetization via the
time-resolved anomalous Nernst effect (TRANE). By generating a short-lived,
local thermal gradient, the magnetic moment is transduced into an electrical
signal. Experimentally, we show that TRANE microscopy has time resolution below
30 ps and spatial resolution limited by the thermal excitation area.
Furthermore, we present numerical simulations to show that the thermal spot
size sets the limits of the spatial resolution, even at 50 nm. The thermal
effects used for TRANE microscopy have no fundamental limit on their spatial
resolution, therefore a future TRANE microscope employing a scanning plasmon
antenna could enable measurements of nanoscale magnetic dynamics.

primordial black holes. We find that for a wide range of parameters preheating
is efficient. In certain cases the inflaton is seen to transfer all its energy
to the gauge fields within a few oscillations. In most cases, we find that the
gauge fields on sub-horizon scales end preheating in an unpolarized state due
to the existence of strong rescattering between the inflaton and gauge-field
modes. We also present a preliminary study of an axion monodromy model coupled
to $U(1)$ gauge fields, seeing a similarly efficient preheating behavior as
well as indications that the coupling strength has an effect on the creation of

is valid up to some energy scale $\Lambda$ to which the Higgs vacuum

ones destabilize the electroweak vacuum and generate the SM hierarchy problem.
For a given perturbative Ultraviolet (UV) completion, the SM cutoff can be
computed in terms of fundamental parameters. If the UV mass spectrum involves
several scales the cutoff is not unique and each SM sector has its own UV
cutoff $\Lambda_i$. We have performed this calculation assuming the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the SM UV completion. As a result, from
the SM point of view, the quadratic corrections to the Higgs mass are
equivalent to finite threshold contributions. For the measured values of the
top quark and Higgs masses, and depending on the values of the different
cutoffs $\Lambda_i$, these contributions can cancel even at renormalization
scales as low as multi-TeV, unlike the case of a single cutoff where the
cancellation only occurs at Planckian energies, a result originally obtained by
Veltman. From the MSSM point of view, the requirement of stability of the
electroweak minimum under radiative corrections is incorporated into the
matching conditions and provides an extra constraint on the Focus Point

can be employed for precise calculations of the Higgs sector in scenarios with

models. These models encompass regular pairwise MRFs with binary variables, but
allow to capture high-order interactions, which are intractable for existing
approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation, mean field, and
variants. We show that a recently proposed variational approach to inference in
log-supermodular models -L-FIELD- reduces to the widely-studied minimum norm
problem for submodular minimization. This insight allows to leverage powerful
existing tools, and hence to solve the variational problem orders of magnitude
more efficiently than previously possible. We then provide another natural
interpretation of L-FIELD, demonstrating that it exactly minimizes a specific
type of R\'enyi divergence measure. This insight sheds light on the nature of
the variational approximations produced by L-FIELD. Furthermore, we show how to
perform parallel inference as message passing in a suitable factor graph at a
linear convergence rate, without having to sum up over all the configurations
of the factor. Finally, we apply our approach to a challenging image
segmentation task. Our experiments confirm scalability of our approach, high
quality of the marginals, and the benefit of incorporating higher-order

wavelengths, we find no evidence for a change in the mean flux density or
spectrum of Sgr A* that can be attributed to interaction with the G2 source.
The absence of a bow shock at low frequencies is consistent with a
cross-sectional area for G2 that is less than $2 \times 10^{29}$ cm$^2$. This
result fits with several model predictions including a magnetically arrested
cloud, a pressure-confined stellar wind, and a stellar photosphere of a binary

greater jet and/or accretion flow emission. Finally, we measure the millimeter
wavelength spectral index of Sgr A* to be flat; combined with previous
measurements, this suggests that there is no spectral break between 230 and 690

hitherto largely overlooked disagreement between Bohr and Heisenberg about the
movability of the ""cut"" between measuring apparatus and observed quantum system
supports the view that, for Bohr, such a cut did not originate in dynamical

considerations. As such, both the motivation and the target of Bohr's doctrine
of classical concepts are of a fundamentally different nature than what is
understood as the dynamical problem of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our
analysis suggests that, contrary to claims often found in the literature,
Bohr's doctrine is not, and cannot be, at odds with proposed solutions to the

currently very limited. Specifically spatially resolved investigations of DIBs
outside of the Local Group is, to our knowledge, inexistent. Here, we explore
the capability of the high sensitivity Integral Field Spectrograph, MUSE, as a
tool to map diffuse interstellar bands at distances larger than 100 Mpc. We use
MUSE commissioning data for AM 1353-272 B, the member with highest extinction
of the ""The Dentist's Chair"", an interacting system of two spiral galaxies.
High signal-to-noise spectra were created by co-adding the signal of many
spatial elements distributed in a geometry of concentric elliptical half-rings.
We derived decreasing radial profiles for the equivalent width of the
$\lambda$5780.5 DIB both in the receding and approaching side of the companion
galaxy up to distances of $\sim$4.6 kpc from the center of the galaxy.
Likewise, interstellar extinction, as derived from the Halpha/Hbeta line ratio
displays a similar trend, with decreasing values towards the external parts.
This translates into an intrinsic correlation between the strength of the DIB
and the extinction within AM 1353-272 B consistent with the current existing
global trend between these quantities when using measurements for both Galactic
and extragalactic sight lines. Mapping of DIB strength in the Local Universe as
up to now only done for the Milky Way seems feasible. This offers a new
approach to study the relationship between DIBs and other characteristics and
species of the ISM in different conditions as those found in our Galaxy to the
use of galaxies in the Local Group and/or single sightlines towards supernovae,
quasars and galaxies outside the Local Group.

incompressible, elastic solid, and the envelope as a non-viscous fluid
satisfying the $n=1$ polytropic equation of state. We discuss how the Love
numbers depend on the size, density, and shear modulus of the core. We then
model the core as a viscoelastic Maxwell solid and compute the tidal
dissipation rate in the planet as characterized by the imaginary part of the
Love number $k_2$. Our results improve upon existing calculations based on
planetary models with a solid core and a uniform ($n=0$) envelope. Our
analytical expressions for the Love numbers can be applied to study tidal
distortion and viscoelastic dissipation of giant planets with solid cores of
various rheological properties, and our general method can be extended to study
tidal distortion/dissipation of super-earths.

multimode radiation is a problem crucial for optics in general and for quantum
optics in particular. It becomes especially important in the case of
nonclassical light that is fragile to optical losses. An example is bright
squeezed vacuum generated via high-gain parametric down conversion or four-wave
mixing. Its highly multiphoton and multimode structure offers a huge increase
in the information capacity provided that each mode can be addressed
separately. However, the nonclassical signature of bright squeezed vacuum,
photon-number correlations, are highly susceptible to losses. Here we
demonstrate lossless filtering of a single spatial Schmidt mode by projecting
the spatial spectrum of bright squeezed vacuum on the eigenmode of a
single-mode fiber. Moreover, we show that the first Schmidt mode can be
captured by simply maximizing the fiber-coupled intensity. Importantly, the
projection operation does not affect the targeted mode and leaves it usable for
further applications.

  August and September 2014. The presentation has been improved and polished",,,,"math.RT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is a survey on the categorification of the poset of generalized
non-crossing partitions, using the representation theory of a hereditary artin
algebra H, looking at the set P of exceptional subcategories in mod H. This
categorification is due to Ingalls and Thomas, and a subsequent paper by Igusa
and Schiffler.
  Starting point is a refinement of the classical tilting theory for mod H,
replacing torsion pairs by torsion triples, thus putting it into the realm of
the stability theory of King. The torsion pairs in mod H correspond nicely to
the perpendicular pairs of exceptional subcategories and there is a wealth of
bijections, the Ingalls-Thomas bijections, between sets of modules and
subcategories.
  If H is representation-finite, one may look at the corresponding numbers of
modules or subcategories. Such Dynkin functions (they attach to a Dynkin
diagram an integer) are displayed in chapter 1. In a mysterious way, many
Dynkin functions can be described using the exponents of the Weyl group.
According to Shapiro and Kostant, the exponents are given by the height
partition of the root poset. A recent result of Abe-Barakat-Cuntz-Hoge-Terao
allows to determine them inductively, going up in a chain of ideals in the root
poset, looking at the corresponding hyperplane arrangements.
  Chapter 4 deals with the case of the linearly oriented quiver of Dynkin type
A. Here P is identified with the lattice NC of non-crossing partitions as
introduced by Kreweras (now an important tool in several parts of mathematics,
for example in free probability theory). We review some classical problems
which are related to the maximal chains in NC: to count labeled trees as well
as parking functions. The combinatorics of the Dynkin case A is just the
combinatorics of the Catalan numbers; in an appendix, we discuss the nature of
classical Catalan combinatorics.

current at discrete frequencies 360 Hz, 720 Hz or 7200 Hz. Over the region of
the pole within 0.5% of the central integrated BdL the resulting AC field
changes can be reduced to less than 1% of the 0.1% input ripple for all

  Problem""",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The heart of the measurement puzzle, namely the problem of definite outcomes,
remains unresolved. This paper shows that Josef Jauch's 1968 reduced density
operator approach is the solution, even though many question it: The entangled
""Measurement State"" implies local mixtures of definite but indeterminate
eigenvalues even though the MS continues evolving unitarily. A second,
independent, argument based on the quantum's nonlocal entanglement with its
measuring apparatus shows that the outcomes must be definite eigenvalues
because of relativity's ban on instant signaling. Experiments with entangled
photon pairs show the MS to be a non-paradoxical superposition of correlations
between states rather than a ""Schrodinger's cat"" superposition of states.
Nature's measurement strategy is to shift the superposition--the
coherence--from the detected quantum to the correlations between the quantum
and its detector, allowing both subsystems to collapse locally to mixtures of
definite eigenvalues. This solution implies an innocuous revision of the
standard eigenvalue-eigenstate link. Three frequent objections to this solution
are rebutted.

has been associated with a dramatic reduction in group velocity and with some

loaded with two inner cylinders with elliptical irises with misaligned angles.
The second structure is composed of loading the waveguide with elliptical
rings. The demonstration of DBE in those waveguide is explained through a
simple multi transmission line approach where the conditions to obtain DBE are
clarified, and suggests that the DBE can occur in several other analogous

unconventional gain schemes in traveling wave tubes or other kinds of

evolution, measurements of its abundance in the atmospheres of the oldest
Galactic stars are still scarce and rather imprecise. At the lowest end of the
metallicity scale, oxygen can only be measured in giant stars and in most of
cases such measurements rely on a single forbidden [O I] 630 nm line that is
very weak and frequently blended with telluric lines. Although molecular OH
lines located in the ultraviolet and infrared could also be used for the
diagnostics, oxygen abundances obtained from the OH lines and the [O I] 630 nm
line are usually discrepant to a level of ~0.3-0.4 dex. Aims. We study the
influence of convection on the formation of the infrared (IR) OH lines and the
forbidden [O I] 630 nm line in the atmospheres of extremely metal-poor (EMP)
red giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
ratio spectra of four EMP red giant stars obtained with the VLT CRIRES
spectrograph. For each EMP star, 4-14 IR OH vibrational-rotational lines
located in the spectral range of 1514-1548 and 1595-1632 nm were used to
determine oxygen abundances by employing standard 1D LTE abundance analysis
methodology. We then corrected the 1D LTE abundances obtained from each
individual OH line for the 3D hydrodynamical effects. Results. We find that the
influence of convection on the formation of [O I] 630 nm line in the
atmospheres of EMP giants studied here is minor, which leads to very small
3D-1D abundance corrections (< -0.01 dex). On the contrary, IR OH lines are
strongly affected by convection and thus the abundance corrections for these
lines are significant, 3D-1D ~ -0.2 ... -0.3 dex. These abundance corrections
do indeed bring the 1D LTE oxygen abundances of EMP red giants obtained using
IR OH lines into better agreement with those determined from the [O I] 630 nm
line.

explore the torque balance criterion for gap-opening (as formulated by Crida et

that even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets
still do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on
whether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so
quickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the
gap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the
planet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been
briefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of
protoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial
it is for gap-opening. This additional condition has important implications for
the survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well as
giant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massive
disks. It is particularly important for planets with intermediate masses
susceptible to Type III-like migration. For some observed transition disks or
disks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses based
on the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient. With
consideration of this additional timescale criterion theoretical studies may
find a reduced planet survivability or that planets may migrate further inwards

parameters for the first time (simple stellar population equivalent age

$[\alpha/\textrm{Fe}]=0.34^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$). Assuming a Kroupa stellar initial
mass function, the stellar population parameters and luminosity
($M_{F814W}=-12.13\pm0.06$ mag) yield a stellar mass of
$M_*=3.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^6 M_{\odot}$, which we also find to be
consistent with near-infrared data. Via mass modelling, with our new
measurements of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{ap}=27\pm2$ km s$^{-1}$) and size
($R_e=20.9\pm1.0$ pc), we obtain an elevated dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio
$M_{dyn}/M_*=8.2$ (with a range $5.6\le M_{dyn}/M_* \le 11.2$). Furthermore, we
analyse the surface brightness profile of S999, finding only a small excess of
light in the outer parts with respect to the fitted S\'ersic profile, and a
positive colour gradient. Taken together these observations suggest that S999
is the remnant of a much larger galaxy that has been tidally stripped. If so,
the observed elevated mass ratio may be caused by mechanisms related to the
stripping process: the existence of an massive central black hole or internal
kinematics that are out of equilibrium due to the stripping event. Given the
observed dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio we suggest that S999 is an ideal
candidate to search for the presence of an overly massive central black hole.

chemically defined thick disk (stars with high [alpha/Fe] ratios and thus old)
has a significantly smaller scale-length than the thin disk. This is in
apparent contradiction with observations of external edge-on galaxies, where
the thin and thick components have comparable scale-lengths. Moreover, while
observed disks do not flare (scale-height does not increase with radius),
numerical simulations suggest that disk flaring is unavoidable, resulting from
both environmental effects and secular evolution. Here we address these
problems by studying two different suites of simulated galactic disks formed in
the cosmological context. We show that the scale-heights of coeval populations
always increase with radius. However, the total population can be decomposed
morphologically into thin and thick disks, which do not flare. We relate this
to the disk inside-out formation, where younger populations have increasingly
larger scale-lengths and flare at progressively larger radii. In this new
picture, thick disks are composed of the imbedded flares of mono-age stellar
populations. Assuming that disks form inside out, we predict that
morphologically defined thick disks must show a decrease in age (or [alpha/Fe]
ratios) with radius and that coeval populations should always flare. This also
explains the observed inversion in the metallicity and [alpha/Fe] gradients for
stars away from the disk midplane in the Milky Way. The results of this work
are directly linked to, and can be seen as evidence of, inside-out disk growth.

among BAL quasars (BALQs). We quantify this diversity by exploring the
distribution of the C IV BAL properties, FWHM, maximum depth of absorption and
its velocity shift ($v_{\rm md}$), using the SDSS DR7 quasar catalogue. We find
the following: (i) Although the median C IV BAL profile in the quasar
rest-frame becomes broader and shallower as the UV continuum slope
($\alpha_{\rm UV}$ at 1700-3000 A) gets bluer, the median individual profile in
the absorber rest-frame remains identical, and is narrow (FWHM = 3500 km/s) and
deep. Only 4 per cent of BALs have FWHM > 10,000 km/s. (ii) As the He II
emission equivalent-width (EW) decreases, the distributions of FWHM and $v_{\rm
md}$ extend to larger values, and the median maximum depth increases. These
trends are consistent with theoretical models in which softer ionizing continua
reduce overionization, and allow radiative acceleration of faster BAL outflows.
(iii) As $\alpha_{\rm UV}$ becomes bluer, the distribution of $v_{\rm md}$
extends to larger values. This trend may imply faster outflows at higher
latitudes above the accretion disc plane. (iv) For non-BALQs, the C IV emission
line decreases with decreasing He II EW, and becomes more asymmetric and
blueshifted. This suggests an increasing relative contribution of emission from
the BAL outflow to the C IV emission line as the ionizing spectral energy
distribution (SED) gets softer, which is consistent with the increasing
fraction of BALQs as the ionizing SED gets softer.

simultaneously probe their magnetic and rotational properties. The brown dwarf
2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5)
detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the
Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar
to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse
periodicity; previous VLA observations detected quiescent emission a factor of
~100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we
present 14 hours of Very Large Array observations of this object that reveal a
series of pulses at ~6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the
pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared
to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of ~1.77 hr and identify it
with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in
a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10
GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2M 1047+21 reaches
at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly-rotating
radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those
of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields
and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this
kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and
magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both
theories and observational data are currently scarce.

distribution and only two identifiable spectral classes, each of which occupies
a broad range of colours and have correlated optical and NIR colours, in
agreement with our previous findings. We report the detection of significant
spectral variations on 5 targets which cannot be attributed to photometry
errors, cosmic rays, point spread function or sensitivity variations, or other
image artifacts capable of explaining the magnitude of the variation. The
spectrally variable objects are found to have a broad range of dynamical
classes, absolute magnitudes, exhibit a broad range of apparent magnitude

variable objects with sufficiently accurate colours for spectral classification
maintain their membership, belonging to the same class at both epochs. 2005

dark matter subhalo, using two independent models of galaxy formation. For the
cases of stellar mass and black hole mass, the median property value displays a
monotonic dependence on subhalo mass. The slope of the relation changes for
subhalo masses for which heating by active galactic nuclei becomes important.
The median property values are predicted to be remarkably similar for central
and satellite galaxies. The two models predict considerable scatter around the
median property value, though the size of the scatter is model dependent. There
is only modest evolution with redshift in the median galaxy property at a fixed
subhalo mass. Properties such as cold gas mass and star formation rate,
however, are predicted to have a complex dependence on subhalo mass. In these
cases subhalo mass is not a good indicator of the value of the galaxy property.
We illustrate how the predictions in the galaxy property - subhalo mass plane
differ from the assumptions made in empirical models of galaxy clustering by
reconstructing the model output using a subhalo abundance matching scheme. In
its simplest form, abundance matching generally does not reproduce the
clustering predicted by the models, typically resulting in an overprediction of
the clustering signal. We show how the basic abundance matching scheme can be
extended to reproduce the model predictions more faithfully, which has
implications for the analysis of galaxy clustering, particularly for low
abundance samples.

analyzed flares, but their parameters do not show any discernible regularities,
and in particular there is no indication for gamma-ray absorption at any fixed
source-frame photon energy. More interestingly, we find that the studied
blazars are characterized by significant spectral variability. Gamma-ray flares
of short duration are often characterized by strong spectral curvature, with
the spectral peak located above 100 MeV. Since these spectral variations are
observed despite excellent photon statistics, they must reflect temporal
fluctuations in the energy distributions of the emitting particles. We suggest
that highly regular gamma-ray spectra of blazars integrated over long time

generalisation of Wilsonian RG flow in a strongly interacting large $N$ quantum
field theory. We firstly define a \textit{highly efficient RG flow} as one in
which the Ward identities related to local conservation of energy, momentum and
charges preserve the same form at each scale -- to achieve this it is necessary
to redefine the background metric and external sources at each scale as
functionals of the effective single trace operators. These redefinitions also
absorb the contributions of the multi-trace operators to these effective Ward
identities. Thus the background metric and external sources become effectively
dynamical reproducing the dual classical gravity equations in one higher
dimension. Here, we focus on reconstructing the pure gravity sector as a highly
efficient RG flow of the energy-momentum tensor operator, leaving the explicit
constructive field theory approach for generating such RG flows to the second
part of the work. We show that special symmetries of the highly efficient RG
flows carry information through which we can decode the gauge fixing of bulk
diffeomorphisms in the corresponding gravity equations. We also show that the
highly efficient RG flow which reproduces a given classical gravity theory in a
given gauge is \textit{unique} provided the endpoint can be transformed to a
non-relativistic fixed point with a finite number of parameters under a
universal rescaling. The results obtained here are used in the second part of
this work, where we do an explicit field-theoretic construction of the RG flow,
and obtain the dual classical gravity theory.

initial mass function (IMF) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) of 85 resolved, young (4 Myr < t < 25 Myr), intermediate mass star
clusters (10^3-10^4 Msun), observed as part of the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program. We fit each cluster's CMD to measure its
mass function (MF) slope for stars >2 Msun. For the ensemble of clusters, the
distribution of stellar MF slopes is best described by
$\Gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. The data
also imply no significant dependencies of the MF slope on cluster age, mass,
and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured MF
represents the IMF. This analysis implies that the high-mass IMF slope in M31
clusters is universal with a slope ($\Gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that is
steeper than the canonical Kroupa (+1.30) and Salpeter (+1.35) values. Using
our inference model on select Milky Way (MW) and LMC high-mass IMF studies from
the literature, we find $\Gamma_{\rm MW} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\Gamma_{\rm LMC}
\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. Thus, while the
high-mass IMF in the Local Group may be universal, systematics in literature
IMF studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations of
the high-mass IMF in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.
Consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of the
high-mass IMF slope to date. We have grafted the M31 high-mass IMF slope onto
widely used sub-solar mass Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs and show that commonly used
UV- and Halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of
~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses >8 Msun are ~25% fewer than
expected for a Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. [abridged]

distribution and dynamics of traits in communities. However, a general theory
of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g., species
that differ in size) and gradients (e.g., temperature), has yet to be
formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory
provides the basis for such a theory it does not explicitly account for
differences traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal
temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling
approaches into a framework that we term Trait Drivers Theory or TDT. It shows
that the shape and dynamics of trait distributions can be uniquely linked to
fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to
future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several
theoretical studies, recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic
gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences
ecosystem productivity across an elevational gradient and a 140-year long
ecological experiment. We argue that our general TDT provides a baseline for
(i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness
in terms of the shape of trait distributions; and (ii) integrating how specific
traits, including body size, and functional diversity scale up to influence the
dynamics of species assemblages across climatic gradients and how shifts in
functional composition influences ecosystem functioning. Further, it offers a
novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness
based approaches in order to build a more predictive functional biogeography to
show how assemblages of species have and will respond to climate change.

obtained with the optimal matched filter technique shows a clear elongation and
an irregular distribution starting from ~300"" from the cluster center. At
larger distances, two tails extending in opposite directions beyond the tidal
radius are also visible. These features are aligned to both the absolute proper
motion and to the Galactic center directions. Moreover, other overdensities
appear to be stretched in a direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane.
Accordingly to the behaviour observed in the density map, we find that both the

a King model starting from ~600"" from the center. These observational evidence
suggest that NGC 6791 is currently experiencing mass loss likely due to
gravitational shocking and interactions with the tidal field. We use this
evidence to argue that NGC 6791 should have lost a significant fraction of its
original mass. A larger initial mass would in fact explain why the cluster
survived so long. Using available recipes based on analytic studies and N-body

holes in their centers. During the quasar phase, a huge luminosity is released
as matter falls onto the black hole, and radiation-driven winds can transfer
most of this energy back to the host galaxy. Over five different epochs, we
detected the signatures of a nearly spherical stream of highly ionized gas in
the broadband X-ray spectra of the luminous quasar PDS 456. This persistent
wind is expelled at relativistic speeds from the inner accretion disk, and its
wide aperture suggests an effective coupling with the ambient gas. The
outflow's kinetic power larger than 10^46 ergs per second is enough to provide
the feedback required by models of black hole and host galaxy co-evolution.

to taking course online is that the online course structure is typically more
student focused than teacher centered and encouraging more active participation
by students in collaborative learning activities. The quality and quantity of
asynchronous and synchronous communications are the key elements for E-learning
success. A potential problem that has received little exploration is student's
feeling of isolation. It is important to have a propitious supervision to
breaking down learner feeling isolation in E learning environment. This feeling
of isolation is among the main causes of loss and high rates of dropout in
E-learning. It impacts on their levels of participation, satisfaction and
learning. To overcome this feeling of isolation, we aim, by this research, to
provide the trainer and each learner with an environment allowing them to
behave as if being face to face; in other words, to approach the pedagogy of
classroom teaching. Our contribution to reduce the feeling of isolation is to
ensure the presence of the teacher in the educational tools. These tools aim to
establish a real dialogue with the learner, forcing him to take an active part

omega(H,Q,V), computed at volumes V near the volume where the Born-Oppenheimer

order theory of bulk modulus. Here, n-th order means smaller than the leading
term by n powers of epsilon, where epsilon is the ratio hbar omega(Q)/E(el) or
kT/E(el), and E(el) is an electronic energy scale, typically 2 to 10 eV.
Experiment often shows evidence for next order corrections. When such

accessible measure of anhamonicity is the quasiparticle (QP) energy,
omega(Q,V,T), seen experimentally by vibrational spectroscopy. However, this

""QP thermodynamics"" is used for this way of treating anharmonicity. It enables
(n+1)-order corrections, if QH theory is accurate to order n. This procedure is
used to give corrections to specific heat and volume thermal expansion. The QH

the challenges of detecting fine-grained activities and understanding how they

activities, which are defined by low inter-class variability and are typically
characterized by fine-grained body motions. We explore how human pose and hands
can help to approach this challenge by comparing two pose-based and two
hand-centric features with state-of-the-art holistic features. To attack the
second challenge, recognizing composite activities, we leverage the fact that
these activities are compositional and that the essential components of the
activities can be obtained from textual descriptions or scripts. We show the
benefits of our hand-centric approach for fine-grained activity classification
and detection. For composite activity recognition we find that decomposition
into attributes allows sharing information across composites and is essential
to attack this hard task. Using script data we can recognize novel composites

the hypothesis of a tidal encounter scenario. Finally, we propose a possible

how to best allocate campaign budget so that the advertiser or campaign-level

the performance of sub-campaigns. This determination is highly related to the
action-attribution problem, i.e. to be able to find out the set of ads, and
hence the sub-campaigns that provided them to a user, that an action should be
attributed to. For this purpose, we employ both last-touch (last ad gets all
credit) and multi-touch (many ads share the credit) attribution methodologies.
We present the algorithms deployed at Turn for the attribution problem, as well
as their parallel implementation on the large advertiser performance datasets.
We conclude the paper with our empirical comparison of last-touch and

inferring the structural connectivity of brain networks from experimentally

(b) an ADMM algorithm for solving it. The algorithm not only recovers the known

good match with experimentally observed quantitative distributions of the

Spatial degrees of freedom are considered to be an environment, entanglement
with which decoheres the internal states. Atoms follow classical trajectories
through space, punctuated by probabilistic jumps between spin states.
  We modify the conventional Monte Carlo wavefunction method to jump between
states when population transfer occurs, rather than when population is later
discarded via exponential decay. This results in a spinor wavefunction that is
continuous in time, and allows us to model the classical particle trajectories
(evolution of the environment variables) more accurately. The model is not
computationally demanding and it agrees well with simulations of the full
spatial wavefunction of an atom.

led to a paradigm that considers path delay and extinction in the atmosphere as
a~priori unknown quantities that have to be evaluated from the radio astronomy
data themselves. Development of our ability to model the atmosphere and to
digest humongous outputs of these models that took place over the course of the

operational numerical weather model GEOS run by NASA, we are in a position to
compute path delay through the neutral atmosphere for any station and for any
epoch from 1979 through now with accuracy of 45 ps * cosec elevation. We are in
a position to compute extinction with accuracy better than 10 pro cents. We are
in a position to do it routinely, in a similar way how we update apparent star
positions for precession and nutation. Moreover, we are in a position to do it
now. As a demonstration of current capabilities, I have computed time series of
path delays for all radiotelecopes that I was aware of (220 sites) since 1979

superfluid 4He with nonuni- form flows by using the vortex filament model. In
recent visualization experiments nonuniform laminar flows of the normal fluid,
namely, Hagen-Poiseuille flow and tail-flattened flow, have been observed.
Tail-flattened flow is a novel laminar flow in which the outer part of the
Hagen-Poiseuille flow becomes flat. In our simulation, the velocity field of
the normal fluid is prescribed to be two nonuniform profiles. This work
addresses a square channel to obtain important physics not revealed in the
preceding numerical works. In the studies of the two profiles we analyze the
statistics of the physical quantities. Under Hagen-Poiseuille flow,
inhomogeneous quantum turbulence appears as a statistically steady state. The
vortex tangle shows a characteristic space-time oscillation. Under
tail-flattened flow, the nature of the quantum turbulence depends strongly on
that flatness. Vortex line density increases significantly as the profile
becomes flatter, being saturated above a certain flatness. The inhomogeneity is
significantly reduced in comparison to the case of Hagen-Poiseuille flow.
Investigating the behavior of quantized vortices reveals that tail-flattened
flow is an intermedi- ate state between Hagen-Poiseuille flow and uniform flow.
In both profiles we obtain a characteristic inhomogeneity in the physical
quantities, which suggests that a boundary layer of superfluid appears near a
solid boundary. The vortex tangle produces a velocity field opposite to the
applied superfluid flow, and, consequently, the superfluid flow becomes smaller
than the applied one.

enables any user to compress different signatures signed by different signers
on different messages into a short signature. Sequential aggregate signature,
in turn, is a special kind of aggregate signature that only allows a signer to
add his signature into an aggregate signature in sequential order. This latter
scheme has applications in diversified settings such as in reducing bandwidth
of certificate chains and in secure routing protocols. Lu, Ostrovsky, Sahai,
Shacham, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2006) presented the first sequential aggregate
signature scheme in the standard model. The size of their public key, however,
is quite large (i.e., the number of group elements is proportional to the
security parameter), and therefore, they suggested as an open problem the
construction of such a scheme with short keys.
  In this paper, we propose the first sequential aggregate signature schemes
with short public keys (i.e., a constant number of group elements) in prime
order (asymmetric) bilinear groups that are secure under static assumptions in
the standard model. Furthermore, our schemes employ a constant number of
pairing operations per message signing and message verification operation.
Technically, we start with a public-key signature scheme based on the recent
dual system encryption technique of Lewko and Waters (TCC 2010). This technique
cannot directly provide an aggregate signature scheme since, as we observed,
additional elements should be published in a public key to support aggregation.
Thus, our constructions are careful augmentation techniques for the dual system
technique to allow it to support sequential aggregate signature schemes. We
also propose a multi-signature scheme with short public parameters in the
standard model.

  integral","35pages",,,,"math.CA nlin.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop an underlying relationship between the theory of rational
approximations and that of isomonodromic deformations. We show that a certain
duality in Hermite's two approximation problems for functions leads to the
Schlesinger transformations, i.e. transformations of a linear differential
equation shifting its characteristic exponents by integers while keeping its
monodromy invariant. Since approximants and remainders are described by
block-Toeplitzs determinants, one can clearly understand the determinantal
structure in isomonodromic deformations. We demonstrate our method in a certain
family of Hamiltonian systems of isomonodromy type including the sixth Painleve
equation and Garnier systems; particularly, we present their solutions written
in terms of iterated hypergeometric integrals. An algorithm for constructing
the Schlesinger transformations is also discussed through vector continued
fractions.

investigation of the asymptotic behavior at infinite time of a solution of a

Finally, the demagnetizing field in a general $p$-Halbach cylinder is

the maximum values of the demagnetizing field is either at $\phi = 0,\pi$ at

Videos differ from images in temporal redundancy. This paper proposes a novel
hybrid method to robustly localize the texts in natural scene images and videos
based on fusion of discrete wavelet transform and gradient difference. A set of
rules and geometric properties have been devised to localize the actual text
regions. Then, morphological operation is performed to generate the text
regions and finally the connected component analysis is employed to localize
the text in a video frame. The experimental results obtained on publicly
available standard ICDAR 2003 and Hua dataset illustrate that the proposed

  older preprint arXiv:0811.2080 (31 pages), which has been completely
  rewritten",,,,"math.RT math.QA math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a general axiomatic framework for algebras with triangular
decomposition, which allows for a systematic study of the
Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand Category $\mathcal{O}$. The framework is stated via
three relatively simple axioms; algebras satisfying them are termed ""regular
triangular algebras (RTAs)"". These encompass a large class of algebras in the
literature, including (a) generalized Weyl algebras, (b) symmetrizable
Kac-Moody Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, (c) quantum groups $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$
over ""lattices with possible torsion"", (d) infinitesimal Hecke algebras, (e)
higher rank Virasoro algebras, and others.
  In order to incorporate these special cases under a common setting, our
theory distinguishes between roots and weights, and does not require the Cartan
subalgebra to be a Hopf algebra. We also allow RTAs to have roots in arbitrary
monoids rather than root lattices, and the roots of the Borel subalgebras to
lie in cones with respect to a strict subalgebra of the Cartan subalgebra.
These relaxations of the triangular structure have not been explored in the
literature.
  We then study the BGG Category $\mathcal{O}$ over an RTA. In order to work
with general RTAs - and also bypass the use of central characters - we
introduce conditions termed the ""Conditions (S)"", under which distinguished
subcategories of Category $\mathcal{O}$ possess desirable homological
properties, including: (a) being a finite length, abelian, self-dual category;
(b) having enough projectives/injectives; or (c) being a highest weight
category satisfying BGG Reciprocity. We discuss whether the above examples
satisfy the various Conditions (S). We also discuss two new examples of RTAs
that cannot be studied using previous theories of Category $\mathcal{O}$, but
require the full scope of our framework. These include the first construction
of algebras for which the ""root lattice"" is non-abelian.

all the maps to the same resolution. We use a CMB template to subtract the

scales with redshift as $T(z)=T_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$, we constrain deviations of
adiabatic evolution to be $\alpha=-0.007\pm 0.013$, consistent with the
temperature-redshift relation of the standard cosmological model. This result
could suffer from a potential bias $\delta\alpha$ associated with the CMB
template, that we quantify it to be $|\delta\alpha|\le 0.02$ and with the same
sign than the measured value of $\alpha$, but is free from those biases
associated with using TSZ selected clusters; it represents the best constraint

providing a multi-scale time-frequency representation of nonlinear and/or
nonstationary signals. To extend this method to vector-valued signals (VvS) in
multidimensional (multi-D) space, a multivariate EMD (MEMD) has been designed
recently, which employs an ensemble projection to extract local extremum
locations (LELs) of the given VvS with respect to different projection
directions. This idea successfully overcomes the problems of locally defining
extrema of VvS. Different from the MEMD, where vector-valued envelopes (VvEs)
are interpolated based on LELs extracted from the 1-D projected signal, the
vector-valued EMD (VEMD) proposed in this paper employs a novel back projection
method to interpolate the VvEs from 1-D envelopes in the projected space.
Considering typical 4-D coordinates (3-D location and time), we show by
numerical simulations that the VEMD outperforms state-of-art methods.

quasi-periodic oscillations. Most likely, these oscillations are caused by
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of flaring loops which modulate the
emission. Interpretation of the observations requires comparing them with
simulations. We simulate the gyrosynchrotron radio emission from a
semi-circular (toroidal-shaped) magnetic loop containing sausage-mode MHD
oscillations. The aim is to detect the observable signatures specific to the
considered MHD mode and to study their dependence on the various source
parameters. The MHD waves are simulated using a linear three-dimensional model
of a magnetized plasma cylinder; both standing and propagating waves are
considered. The curved loop is formed by replicating the MHD solutions along
the plasma cylinder and bending the cylinder; this model allows us to study the
effect of varying the viewing angle along the loop. The radio emission is
simulated using a three-dimensional model and its spatial and temporal
variations are analyzed. We consider several loop orientations and different
parameters of the magnetic field, plasma, and energetic electrons in the loop.
In the model with low plasma density, the intensity oscillations at all
frequencies are synchronous (with the exception of a narrow spectral region
below the spectral peak). In the model with high plasma density, the emission
at low frequencies (where the Razin effect is important) oscillates in
anti-phase with the emissions at higher frequencies. The oscillations at high
and low frequencies are more pronounced in different parts of the loop
(depending on the loop orientation). The layers where the line-of-sight
component of the magnetic field changes sign can produce additional
peculiarities in the oscillation patterns.

collective wisdom surpasses the cumulative individual expertise, little is
understood on the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced environment.
A proper understanding of the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced
environment would enable one in the better designing of such environments to
solicit knowledge from the crowd. Our experiment on crowdsourced systems based
on annotations shows that an important reason for the rapid knowledge building
in such environments is due to variance in expertise. First, we used as our
test bed, a customized Crowdsourced Annotation System (CAS) which provides a
group of users the facility to annotate a given document while trying to
understand it. Our results showed the presence of different genres of
proficiency amongst the users of an annotation system. We observed that the
ecosystem in crowdsourced annotation system comprised of mainly four categories
of contributors, namely: Probers, Solvers, Articulators and Explorers. We
inferred from our experiment that the knowledge garnering mainly happens due to
the synergetic interaction across these categories. Further, we conducted an
analysis on the dataset of Wikipedia and Stack Overflow and noticed the
ecosystem presence in these portals as well. From this study, we claim that the

on the coupling parameters $\kappa$ and $\varepsilon$. Specifically, for

the inequality $a_0>\sqrt{3}L_P$ on the initial size $a_0$ of the closed

term is weighted by inverse of characteristic relaxation time suggesting
greater mobility of the constituents induce faster aging in a material. A
dependence of relaxation time on free energy is proposed, which under quiescent
conditions, leads to power law dependence of relaxation time on waiting time as
observed experimentally. The model considers two cases namely, a constant
modulus when aging is entropy controlled and a time dependent modulus. In the

the model predicts how material undergoes aging and approaches rejuvenated
state under application of deformation field. Particularly model proposes
distinction between various kinds of rheological effects for different

and the entropy expansion coefficients in the case of the monomer-dimer model
on infinite regular lattices, we have shown that, on hypercubic lattices of any
dimension, the virial coefficients are positive through the 20th order. We have
observed that all virial coefficients so far known for this system are positive
also on infinite regular lattices with different structure. We are thus led to
conjecture that the virial expansion coefficients $m_k $ are always positive.
These considerations can be extended to the study of related bounds on finite
graphs generalizing the infinite regular lattices, namely the finite grids and
the regular biconnected graphs. The validity of the bounds $\Delta^k {\rm
ln}(i! N(i)) \le 0$ for $k \ge 2$, where $N(i)$ is the number of configurations
of $i$ dimers on the graph and $\Delta$ is the forward difference operator, is
shown to correspond to the positivity of the virial coefficients. Our tests on
many finite lattice graphs indicate that on large lattices these bounds are
satisfied, giving support to the conjecture on the positivity of the virial
coefficients. An exhaustive survey of some classes of regular biconnected
graphs with a not too large number $v$ of vertices shows only few violations of
these bounds. We conjecture that the frequency of the violations vanishes as $v
\to \infty$. We find rigorous upper bounds on $N(i)$ valid for arbitrary graphs
and for regular graphs. The similarity between the Heilman-Lieb inequality and
the one conjectured above suggests that one study the stricter inequality $m_k
\ge \frac{1}{2k}$ for the virial coefficients, which is valid for all the known
coefficients of the infinite regular lattice models.

particular 'boom' in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the
2011 Tohoku tsunami. Despite an extensive literature, there is very little to
no understanding of the role that the changing coastal environment is playing
on the record of a tsunami, and for a given location, it is still unclear
whether the largest tsunamis leave the largest amount of deposits. To research
this question, the present study took place in Japan, in the Tohoku Region at
Agawa-pond, because the pond act as a sediment trap. Using a sediment-slicer, a
1 m thick deposit was retrieved, from which 4 tsunami sequences were
identified, including the latest 2011 tsunami. Using a series of sedimentary
proxies: the AMS (Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility), grain size analysis,
quartz morphoscopy (morphology and surface characteristics) and the analysis of
microfossils, disparities between the tsunami deposits were identified and most
importantly a clear thinning of the tsunami deposit towards the top. Provided
the present evidences, the authors discuss that the upward fining is due to at
least two components that are seldom assessed in tsunami research (1) a
modification of the depositional environment, with the progressive
anthropization of the coast, providing less sediments to remobilize; and (2) a
progressive filling of the Agawa pond, which progressively loses its ability to
trap tsunami materials.

the gauge fields of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory is studied using the
overlap-fermion quark propagator in Lattice QCD. Overlap fermions provide a
lattice realisation of chiral symmetry and consequently offer a unique
opportunity to explore the interplay of centre vortices, instantons and
dynamical mass generation. Simulations are performed on gauge fields featuring
the removal of centre vortices, identified through gauge transformations
maximising the center of the gauge group. In contrast to previous results using
the staggered-fermion action, the overlap-fermion results illustrate a loss of
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking coincident with vortex removal. This result
is linked to the overlap-fermion's sensitivity to the subtle manner in which
instanton degrees of freedom are compromised through the process of centre
vortex removal. Backgrounds consisting solely of the identified centre vortices
are also investigated. After smoothing the vortex-only gauge fields, we observe
dynamical mass generation on the vortex-only backgrounds consistent within
errors with the original gauge-field ensemble following the same smoothing.
Through visualizations of the instanton-like degrees of freedom in the various
gauge-field ensembles, we find evidence of a link between the centre vortex and
instanton structure of the vacuum. While vortex removal destabilizes
instanton-like objects under ${\cal
  O}(a^4)$-improved cooling, vortex-only backgrounds provide gauge-field
degrees of freedom sufficient to create instantons upon cooling.

tangled commit. Sharing tangled commits is problematic because it makes review,
reversion, and integration of these commits harder and historical analyses of

dataset of untangled code changes, created with the help of two developers who
accurately split their code changes into self contained tasks over a period of
four months; (2) a novel approach, EpiceaUntangler, to help developers share
untangled commits (aka. atomic commits) by using fine-grained code change

propose that in these systems part of the material transferred from the

lobe of the white dwarf, preventing the radiation from ionizing the ejecta of
the system and increasing the optical decline time-scale. We explain why this
phenomenon is more likely in systems with a high mass transfer rate and a short

material transferred from the companion is sufficient to absorb the radiation
from the white dwarf in these systems, ultimately supporting this scenario as

distributions and grain sizes of the forsterite crystals in the circumstellar

Herschel/PACS observations. We can reproduce the non-detection of the

where the forsterite is distributed in the whole outflow, in the superwind
region, or in the AGB-wind region emitted previous to the superwind, but we
cannot discriminate between these three models. To reproduce the observed
spectral bands with these three models, the forsterite crystals need to be
dominated by a grain size population of 2 micrometre up to 6 micrometre. We
hypothesise that the large forsterite crystals were formed after the superwind
phase of IRAS 17150-3224, where the star developed an as yet unknown hyperwind
with an extremely high mass-loss rate (10^-3 Msol/yr). The high densities of
such a hyperwind could be responsible for the efficient grain growth of both
amorphous and crystalline dust in the outflow. Several mechanisms are discussed
that might explain the lower-limit of 2 micrometre found for the forsterite
grains, but none are satisfactory. Among the mechanisms explored is a possible
selection effect due to radiation pressure based on photon scattering on
micron-sized grains.

Photometric Reverberation Mapping with broad and narrow band filters, we
determine the size of the broad-line emitting region by measuring the time

The H$\alpha$ emission line responds to blue continuum variations with an
average rest frame lag of $19.0 \pm 1.23$ days. Using single epoch spectroscopy
we determined a broad-line H$\alpha$ velocity width of 1020 km s$^{-1}$ and in
combination with the rest frame lag and adoption a geometric scaling factor $f

M_{\odot}$. Using the flux variation gradient method, we separate the host
galaxy contribution from that of the AGN to calculate the rest frame 5100\AA~
luminosity at the time of our monitoring campaign. The rest frame lag and the
host-subtracted luminosity permit us to derive the position of PGC50427 in the
BLR size -- AGN luminosity diagram, which is remarkably close to the
theoretically expected relation of $R \propto L^{0.5}$. The simultaneous
optical and NIR ($J$ and $K_{s}$) observations allow us to determine the size
of the dust torus through the use of dust reverberation mapping method. We find
that the hot dust emission ($\sim 1800K$) lags the optical variations with an
average rest frame lag of $46.2 \pm 2.60$ days. The dust reverberation radius
and the nuclear NIR luminosity permit us to derive the position of PGC50427 on
the known $\tau - M{V}$ diagram. The simultaneus observations for the
broad-line region and dust thermal emission demonstrate that the innermost dust
torus is located outside the BLR in PGC50427, supporting the unified scheme for

affects the partitioning performance in the detectable region. We use the
replica method, which is often used in the field of spin-glass theory, and
focus on the case of bisection. We show that the gap between the estimated
threshold for the spectral method and the threshold obtained from Bayesian
inference is considerable in sparse graphs, even without eigenvector
localization. This gap closes in a dense limit.

materials is critical to improve the function and performance of structures and
devices in a diverse spectrum of technologies. Currently, such information can
only be provided by the phonon spectral energy density (SED) or equivalently
time domain normal mode analysis (TDNMA) methods in the framework of
equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (EMD), but has not been realized in
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD) so far. In this paper we
generate a new scheme directly based on NEMD and lattice dynamics theory,
called time domain direct decomposition method (TDDDM), to predict the phonon
mode specific thermal conductivity. Two benchmark cases of Lennard-Jones (LJ)
Argon and Stillinger-Weber (SW) Si are studied by TDDDM to characterize
contributions of individual phonon modes to overall thermal conductivity and
the results are compared with that predicted using SED and TDNMA. Excellent
agreements are found for both cases, which confirm the validity of our TDDDM
approach. The biggest advantage of TDDDM is that it can be used to investigate
the size effect of individual phonon modes in NEMD simulations, which cannot be
tackled by SED and TDNMA in EMD simulations currently. We found that the phonon
modes with mean free path larger than the system size are truncated in NEMD and
contribute little to the overall thermal conductivity. The TDDDM provides
direct physical origin for the well-known strong size effects in thermal
conductivity prediction by NEMD.

variability of PSR J1022+1001. We have detected approximately 14,000 sub-pulses
(components of single pulses) in 35-hr long observations, mostly located at the
trailing component of the integrated profile. Their flux densities and
fractional polarisation suggest that they represent the bright end of the
energy distribution in ordinary emission mode and are not giant pulses. The
occurrence of sub-pulses from the leading and trailing components of the
integrated profile is shown to be correlated. For sub-pulses from the latter, a
preferred pulse width of approximately 0.25 ms has been found. Using
simultaneous observations from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, we have found that the integrated profile
varies on a timescale of a few tens of minutes. We show that improper
polarisation calibration and diffractive scintillation cannot be the sole
reason for the observed instability. In addition, we demonstrate that timing
residuals generated from averages of the detected sub-pulses are dominated by
phase jitter, and place an upper limit of ~700 ns for jitter noise based on
continuous 1-min integrations.

"1502.06797","Christian David","Albert Cohen (LPMC), Ronald Devore (TAMU)","Approximation of high-dimensional parametric PDEs",,,,,"math.AP cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parametrized families of PDEs arise in various contexts such as inverse
problems, control and optimization, risk assessment, and uncertainty
quantification. In most of these applications, the number of parameters is
large or perhaps even infinite. Thus, the development of numerical methods for
these parametric problems is faced with the possible curse of dimensionality.
This article is directed at (i) identifying and understanding which properties
of parametric equations allow one to avoid this curse and (ii) developing and
analyzing effective numerical methodd which fully exploit these properties and,
in turn, are immune to the growth in dimensionality. The first part of this
article studies the smoothness and approximability of the solution map, that
is, the map $a\mapsto u(a)$ where $a$ is the parameter value and $u(a)$ is the
corresponding solution to the PDE. It is shown that for many relevant
parametric PDEs, the parametric smoothness of this map is typically holomorphic
and also highly anisotropic in that the relevant parameters are of widely
varying importance in describing the solution. These two properties are then
exploited to establish convergence rates of $n$-term approximations to the
solution map for which each term is separable in the parametric and physical
variables. These results reveal that, at least on a theoretical level, the
solution map can be well approximated by discretizations of moderate
complexity, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality is broken. This
theoretical analysis is carried out through concepts of approximation theory
such as best $n$-term approximation, sparsity, and $n$-widths. These notions
determine a priori the best possible performance of numerical methods and thus
serve as a benchmark for concrete algorithms. The second part of this article
turns to the development of numerical algorithms based on the theoretically
established sparse separable approximations. The numerical methods studied fall
into two general categories. The first uses polynomial expansions in terms of
the parameters to approximate the solution map. The second one searches for
suitable low dimensional spaces for simultaneously approximating all members of
the parametric family. The numerical implementation of these approaches is
carried out through adaptive and greedy algorithms. An a priori analysis of the
performance of these algorithms establishes how well they meet the theoretical
benchmarks.

with a combination of ultrafast optical spectroscopy techniques, and determine
the individual characteristic relaxation times of charge, spin and valley in a
MoS$_{2}$ monolayer. These results lay the foundations for understanding the
mechanisms of spin and valley polarization loss in two-dimensional TMDs:
spin/valley polarizations survive almost two-orders of magnitude longer for
holes, where spin and valley dynamics are interlocked, than for electrons,
where these degrees of freedom are decoupled. This may lead to novel approaches
for the integration of materials with large spin-orbit in robust
spintronic/valleytronic platforms.

applications, including recommendation systems, construction of aggregated
listings and directories, and knowledge base construction. Current solutions
focus on entity extraction using a single query, e.g., only using ""give me
another restaurant"", when assembling a list of all restaurants. Due to the cost
of human labor, solutions that focus on a single query can be highly
impractical.
  In this paper, we leverage the fact that entity extraction often focuses on
{\em structured domains}, i.e., domains that are described by a collection of
attributes, each potentially exhibiting hierarchical structure. Given such a
domain, we enable a richer space of queries, e.g., ""give me another Moroccan
restaurant in Manhattan that does takeout"". Naturally, enabling a richer space
of queries comes with a host of issues, especially since many queries return
empty answers. We develop new statistical tools that enable us to reason about
the gain of issuing {\em additional queries} given little to no information,
and show how we can exploit the overlaps across the results of queries for
different points of the data domain to obtain accurate estimates of the gain.
We cast the problem of {\em budgeted entity extraction} over large domains as
an adaptive optimization problem that seeks to maximize the number of extracted
entities, while minimizing the overall extraction costs. We evaluate our
techniques with experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating a yield of up to 4X over competing approaches for the same

We show that personalized security indicators can help users to detect phishing
attacks and have very little deployment cost. Personalized security indicators,
however, rely on the user alertness to detect phishing attacks. Previous work
in the context of website phishing has shown that users tend to ignore the
absence of security indicators and fall victim of the attacker. Consequently,
the research community has deemed personalized security indicators as an
ineffective phishing detection mechanism.
  We evaluate personalized security indicators as a phishing detection solution
in the context of mobile applications. We conducted a large-scale user study
where a significant amount of participants that used personalized security
indicators were able to detect phishing. All participants that did not use
indicators could not detect the attack and entered their credentials to a
phishing application. We found the difference in the attack detection ratio to
be statistically significant. Personalized security indicators can, therefore,
help phishing detection in mobile applications and their reputation as an
anti-phishing mechanism should be reconsidered.
  We also propose a novel protocol to setup personalized security indicators

has recently been identified. The observed large dispersion measure values of
FRBs suggests an extragalactic origin and an accurate determination of their
positions and distances will provide an unique opportunity to study the
magneto-ionic properties of the IGM. So far, FRBs have all been found using
large dishes equipped with multi-pixel arrays. While large single dishes are
well-suited for the discovery of transient sources they are poor at providing
accurate localisations. A 2D snapshot image of the sky, made with a correlation
interferometer array, can provide an accurate localisation of many compact
radio sources simultaneously. However, the required time resolution to detect
FRBs and a desire to detect them in real time, makes this currently
impractical. In a beamforming approach, where many narrow tied-array beams are
produced, the advantages of single dishes and interferometers can be combined.
We present a proof-of-concept analysis of a new non-imaging method that
utilises the additional spectral and comparative spatial information obtained
from multiple overlapping TABs to estimate a transient source location with up
to arcsecond accuracy in almost real time. We show that this method can work
for a variety of interferometric configurations, including for LOFAR and
MeerKAT, and that the estimated angular position may be sufficient to identify
a host galaxy without reference to other simultaneous or follow-up
observations. With this method, many transient sources can be localised to
small fractions of a HPBW of a TAB, in the case of MeerKAT, sufficient to
localise a source to arcsecond accuracy. In cases where the position is less
accurately determined we can still significantly reduce the area that need be
searched for associated emission at other wavelengths and potential host
galaxies.

in graphenelike structures, and numerically check its predictions. We treat
first a specific combination of bond transmissivity rates, where mean field
predicts, and numerics to a large extent confirms, that the sublattice
structure characteristic of honeycomb networks becomes irrelevant. Dynamics, in
the various regions of the phase diagram set by open boundary injection and
ejection rates, is then in general identical to that of one-dimensional
systems, although some discrepancies remain between mean-field theory and
numerical results, in similar ways for both geometries. However, at the
critical point for which the characteristic exponent is z = 3/2 in one
dimension, the mean-field value z = 2 is approached for very large systems with
constant (finite) aspect ratio. We also treat a second combination of bond (and
boundary) rates where, more typically, sublattice distinction persists. For the
two rate combinations, in continuum or late-time limits, respectively, the
coupled sets of mean-field dynamical equations become tractable with various
techniques and give a two-band spectrum, gapless in the critical phase. While
for the second rate combination quantitative discrepancies between mean-field
theory and simulations increase for most properties and boundary rates
investigated, theory still is qualitatively correct in general, and gives a
fairly good quantitative account of features such as the late-time evolution of
density profile differences from their steady-state values.

is treated as physically real and the collapse of the wave function is a
physical process. This appears to introduce a time reversal asymmetry into the
dynamics of the wave function since the collapses affect only the future state.
This paper challenges this conclusion, showing that in three different examples
of time asymmetries associated with collapse models, if the physically real
part of the model can be reduced to the locations in space and time about which
collapses occur, then such a model works both forward and backward in time, in
each case satisfying the Born rule. Despite the apparent asymmetry of the
collapse process, these models in fact have time reversal symmetry. Any
physically observed time asymmetries that arise in such models are due to the
asymmetric imposition of initial or final time boundary conditions, rather than
from an inherent asymmetry in the dynamical law. This is the standard
explanation of time asymmetric behaviour resulting from time symmetric laws.

electrochemically-gated graphene field-effect transistors. The geometrical
capacitance of the electrochemical top-gates is accurately determined from
dual-gated Raman measurements, allowing a quantitative analysis of the
frequency, linewidth and integrated intensity of the main Raman features of
graphene. The anomalous behavior observed for the G-mode phonon is in very good
agreement with theoretical predictions and provides a measurement of the
electron-phonon coupling constant for zone-center ($\Gamma$ point) optical
phonons. In addition, the decrease of the integrated intensity of the 2D-mode
feature with increasing doping, makes it possible to determine the
electron-phonon coupling constant for near zone-edge (K and K' points) optical
phonons. We find that the electron-phonon coupling strength at $\Gamma$ is five
times weaker than at K (K'), in very good agreement with a direct measurement
of the ratio of the integrated intensities of the resonant intra- (2D') and
inter-valley (2D) Raman features. We also show that electrochemical reactions,
occurring at large gate biases, can be harnessed to efficiently create defects
in graphene, with concentrations up to approximately $1.4\times 10^{12}~\rm
cm^{-2}$. At such defect concentrations, we estimate that the electron-defect
scattering rate remains much smaller than the electron-phonon scattering rate.
The evolution of the G- and 2D-mode features upon doping remain unaffected by
the presence of defects and the doping dependence of the D mode closely follows
that of its two-phonon (2D mode) overtone. Finally, the linewidth and frequency
of the G-mode phonon as well as the frequencies of the G- and 2D-mode phonons
in doped graphene follow sample-independent correlations that can be utilized
for accurate estimations of the charge carrier density.

MeV was resolved by including collective excitations of both nuclei, leading to
a secondary rainbow. There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution
of collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in
the overlap region of heavy nuclei.
  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by
channel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is
sensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit
evidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or
otherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.
  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing
the elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the
elastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation
of the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and
other parameters can be studied.
  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined
excitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from
uniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent
increase in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the
non-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling
between the collective states is found.
  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs
have forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a
uniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the
contribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning
which remarkably little is known in general.

is considered under quantum size effects. Thermodynamic quantities are
calculated from their relations with partition function which consists of
triple infinite summations over momentum states in each direction. To get
analytical expressions, summations are converted to integrals for macro systems
by continuum approximation which fails at nanoscales. To avoid both from the
numerical calculation of summations and the failure of their integral
approximations at nanoscale, a method which gives an analytical expression for
single particle partition function (SPPF) is proposed. It's shown that
dimensional transition in momentum space occurs at certain magnitude of
confinement. Therefore, to represent SPPF by lower-dimensional analytical
expressions becomes possible rather than numerical calculation of summations.
Considering rectangular domains with different aspect ratios, comparison of the
results of derived expressions with those of summation forms of SPPF is done.
It's shown that analytical expressions for SPPF give very precise results with
maximum relative errors of around 1%, 2% and 3% at just the transition point

transitions, expressions for free energy, entropy, internal energy, chemical
