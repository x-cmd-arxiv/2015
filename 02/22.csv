numerical models, and conduct simulated blast experiments in animal models. As
DoD interests desire to field wearable sensors as blast dosimeters, shock tubes
may also serve for calibration and testing of these devices. The high blast
pressures needed for experimental testing of candidate armors are unnecessary
to test these sensors. An inexpensive, efficient, and easily available way of
testing these pressure sensors is desirable. It is known that releasing
compressed gas suddenly can create a repeatable shock front, and the pressures
can be finely tuned by changing the pressure to which the gas is compressed. A
Crosman 0.177 caliber air pistol was used (without loading any pellets) to
compress and release air in one end of a 24 inch long 3/4 inch diameter
standard pipe nipple to simulate a blast wave at the other end of the tube. A
variable number of pumps were used to vary the peak blast pressure. As
expected, the trials where 10 pumps were used to compress the air resulted in
the largest average peak pressure of 101.99 kPa (+/- 2.63 kPa). The design with
7 pumps had the second biggest peak pressure, with an average peak pressure of
89.11 kPa (+/-1.77 kPa). The design with 5 pumps had the third largest peak
pressure, with an average peak pressure of 78.80 kPa (+/-1.74 kPa). 3 pumps
produced an average peak pressure of 61.37 kPa (+/-2.20 kPa). 2 pumps produced
an average peak pressure of 48.11 kPa (+/-1.57 kPa). The design with just 1
pump had the smallest peak pressure and produced an average peak pressure of
30.13 kPa (+/-0.79 kPa). This inexpensive shock tube design had a shot-to-shot
cycle time of between 30 and 45 seconds.

databases with isothermal and exothermic reactions are examined. The chemical
reaction and heat release effects on the turbulent velocity, passive scalar and
reactive species fields are studied using their probability density functions
(PDF) and higher order moments for velocities and scalar fields, as well as
their gradients. With the aid of the anisotropy invariant maps for the Reynolds
stress tensor the heat release effects on the anisotropy level at different
wall-normal locations are evaluated and found to be most accentuated in the
near-wall region. It is observed that the small-scale anisotropies are
persistent both in the near-wall region and inside the jet flame. Two
exothermic cases with different Damkohler number are examined and the
comparison revealed that the Damkohler number effects are most dominant in the
near-wall region, where the wall cooling effects are influential. In addition,
with the aid of PDFs conditioned on the mixture fraction, the significance of
the reactive scalar characteristics in the reaction zone is illustrated. We
argue that the combined effects of strong intermittency and strong persistency
of anisotropy at the small scales in the entire domain can affect mixing and
ultimately the combustion characteristics of the reacting flow.

explain the background, but not above $\simeq$0.3 MeV. Beyond $\sim$10 MeV
blazars appear to account for the flux observed. That leaves an unexplained gap
for which different candidates have been proposed, including annihilations of
WIMPS. One candidate are Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Early studies concluded
that they were able to account for the $\gamma$--ray background in the gap,
while later work attributed a significantly lower contribution to them.
  All those estimates were based on SN Ia explosion models which did not
reflect the full 3D hydrodynamics of SNe Ia explosions. In addition, new
measurements obtained since 2010 have provided new, direct estimates of high-z
SNe Ia rates beyond $z\sim$2. We take into account these new advances to see
the predicted contribution to the gamma--ray background.
  We use here a wide variety of explosion models and a plethora of new
measurements of SNe Ia rates. SNe Ia still fall short of the observed
background. Only for a fit, which would imply $\sim$150\% systematic error in
detecting SNe Ia events, do the theoretical predictions approach the observed
fluxes. This fit is, however, at odds at the highest redshifts with recent SN
Ia rates estimates. Other astrophysical sources such as FSRQs do match the
observed flux levels in the MeV regime, while SNe Ia make up to 30--50\% of the

the replacement of the standard flattening filters by ad hoc thin filters which
were modeled by comparing dose measurements and simulations. The experimental
dose profiles for the 6MV and 10MV FFF beams were obtained from the Varian
Golden Data Set and from in-house measurements for radiation fields ranging
from 3X3 to 40X40 cm2. Indicators of agreement between the experimental data

the dose differences, the root-mean-square error and the gamma index. The same

comparisons show a good agreement of the dose for the ansatz geometry similar

Casimir-Polder forces between an atom or molecule and two macroscopic bodies
can be achieved. This is an extension of previous studies of the interaction
between a polarizable atom and a wedge, in which repulsion occurs if the atom
is sufficiently anisotropic and close enough to the symmetry plane of the
wedge. A similar repulsion occurs if such an atom passes a thin cylinder or a
wire. An obvious extension is to compute the interaction between such an atom
and two facing wedges, which includes as a special case the interaction of an
atom with a conducting screen possessing a slit, or between two parallel wires.
To this end we further extend the electromagnetic multiple-scattering formalism
for three-body interactions. To test this machinery we reinvestigate the
interaction of a polarizable atom between two parallel conducting plates. In
that case, three-body effects are shown to be small, and are dominated by
three- and four-scattering terms. The atom-wedge calculation is illustrated by
an analogous scalar situation, described in the Appendix. The wedge-wedge-atom
geometry is difficult to analyze because this is a scale-free problem. But it
is not so hard to investigate the three-body corrections to the interaction
between an anisotropic atom or nanoparticle and a pair of parallel conducting
cylinders, and show that the three-body effects are very small and do not
affect the Casimir-Polder repulsion at large distances between the cylinders.
Finally, we consider whether such highly anisotropic atoms needed for repulsion
are practically realizable. Since this appears rather difficult to accomplish,
it may be more feasible to observe such effects with highly anisotropic nano
particles.

on a rooted tree $T$ in which the arity of each vertex is independently Poisson
distributed with mean $d$. Specifically, we investigate the question of which
parameter settings $(d, \lambda)$ result in strong spatial mixing, weak spatial
mixing, or neither. (In our context, weak spatial mixing is equivalent to Gibbs
uniqueness.) For finite fugacity, a zero-one law implies that these spatial
mixing properties hold either almost surely or almost never, once we have
conditioned on whether $T$ is finite or infinite.
  We provide a partial answer to this question, which implies in particular
that
  1. As $d \to \infty$, weak spatial mixing on the Poisson tree occurs whenever
$\lambda < f(d) - o(1)$ but not when $\lambda$ is slightly above $f(d)$, where
$f(d)$ is the threshold for WSM (and SSM) on the $d$-regular tree. This
suggests that, in most cases, Poisson trees have similar spatial mixing
behavior to regular trees.
  2. When $1 < d \le 1.179$, there is weak spatial mixing on the Poisson($d$)
tree for all values of $\lambda$. However, strong spatial mixing does not hold
for sufficiently large $\lambda$. This is in contrast to regular trees, for
which strong spatial mixing and weak spatial mixing always coincide.
  For infinite fugacity SSM holds only when the tree is finite, and hence
almost surely fails on the Poisson($d$) tree when $d>1$. We show that WSM
almost surely holds on the Poisson($d$) tree for $d <
\mathbf{e}^{1/\sqrt{2}}/\sqrt{2} =1.434...$, but that it fails with positive

Historically, it has been proposed as postulate, part of a genius empirical
relationship $E=\hbar \omega$ in order to explain the intensity spectrum of the
blackbody radiation for which classical electrodynamic theory led to an
unacceptable prediction: The ultraviolet catastrophe. While the usefulness of
the Planck constant in various fields of physics is undisputed, its derivation
(or lack of) remains unsatisfactory from a fundamental point of view. In this
paper, the analysis of the blackbody problem is performed with a series
expansion of the electromagnetic field in terms of TE, TM modes in a metallic
cavity with small losses, that leads to developing the electromagnetic fields
in a \textit{complete set of orthonormal functions}. This expansion, based on
coupled power theory, maintains both space and time together enabling modeling
of the blackbody's evolution toward equilibrium. Reaching equilibrium with a
multimodal waveguide analysis brings into consideration the coupling between
modes in addition to absorption and emission of radiation. The properties of
the modes, such as spectral broadening, losses and lifetime, then progressively
become independent of frequency and explains how equilibrium is allowed in good
conductor metallic cavities. Based on the free electron relaxation time in
gold, a value of $\hbar = 1.02 \times 10^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s for the reduced
Planck constant is found and the uncertainty principle is also emerging from
this \textit{a priori} classical study. The Planck constant is then obtained no
longer as an ad hoc addition but as a natural consequence of the analysis
taking boundary conditions into account as into optical resonators. That
analysis based on finite-spacetime paradigm, also shine new light on the notion
of decoherence in classical optics and electrodynamics.

sufficient to allow recovery of the entire file, the goal is for each user to
gain access to the file while minimizing some communication cost. We assume
that users can communicate over a noiseless broadcast channel, and that the
communication cost is a sum of each user's cost function over the number of

exciting problems: on the lepton side, the origin of the rise of the CR
positron fraction e+/(e- + e+) at ~10 - 300 GeV of energy; on the hadron side,
the nature of the spectral hardening observed in CR protons and nuclei at ~TeV
energies. The lepton anomaly indicates the existence of a nearby e+/- source.
It has been proposed that high-energy positrons can be produced inside nearby
supernova remnants (SNRs) via interactions of CR hadrons with the ambient
medium. A distinctive prediction of this mechanism is a high-energy rise of the
boron-to-carbon ratio, which has not been observed. It also requires old SNRs
at work (with ineffective magnetic field amplification and slow shock speed),
that cannot account for the CR hadronic spectra observed up to the knee
energies (~5 PeV). We propose a new picture where, in addition to such a nearby
CR accelerator, the high-energy spectrum of CR hadrons is provided by the
large-scale population of SNRs, on average younger, that can efficiently
accelerate CRs up to the knee. Under this scenario, the spectral hardening of
CR hadrons can be naturally interpreted as the transition between the two
components. As we will show, our two-component model breaks the connection
between the positron fraction and the boron-to-carbon ratio, which is now
predicted to decrease with energy in accordance with the data. Forthcoming data
from AMS will be crucial for testing this model.

sequences and then for sequences with a jump in linear complexity. The basic
idea is to decompose the denominator as a sum of polynomial multiples of two
polynomials of minimal degree; there is a similar decomposition for the
numerators. The decomposition is unique when the denominator has degree at most
the length of the sequence. The proof also applies to rational functions
related to finite sequences, generalising a result of Massey. We give a number
of applications to rational functions associated to sequences.

transactions. It is designed to serve as an experimental test bed for economic
simulations that can explore the banking system's influence on the
macro-economy under varying assumptions for its regulatory framework, mix of
financial instruments, and activities of borrowers and lenders. Support is
provided for Basel Capital and central bank reserve regulatory frameworks,
inter-bank lending and correct handling of loan defaults within the bank
accounting framework.
  In this paper we provide an overview of the design of Threadneedle, and the
rational for the double entry book keeping approach used in its implementation.
We then provide evidence from a series of experiments using the simulation that
the macro-economic behaviour of the banking system is in some cases sensitive
to double entry book keeping ledger definitions, and in particular that loss
provisions can be systemically affecting. We also show that credit and money
expansion in Basel regulated systems is now dominated by the Basel capital
requirements, rather than the older central bank reserve requirements. This
implies that bank profitability is now the main factor in providing new capital
to support lending, meaning that lowering interest rates can act to restrict
loan supply, rather than increasing borrowing as currently believed. We also
show that long term liquidity flows due to interest repayment act in favour of
the bank making the loan, and do not provide any long term throttling effect on
loan expansion and money expansion as has been claimed by Keynes and others.

important mathematical properties -- maximum principles, comparison principles,
and the non-negative constraint -- for a general linear second-order elliptic
partial differential equation. We critically review some recent developments in
the field of discrete maximum principles, derive new results, and discuss some
possible future research directions in this area. In particular, we derive
restrictions for a three-node triangular (T3) element and a four-node
quadrilateral (Q4) element to satisfy comparison principles, maximum
principles, and the non-negative constraint under the standard single-field
Galerkin formulation. Analysis is restricted to uniformly elliptic linear
differential operators in divergence form with Dirichlet boundary conditions
specified on the entire boundary of the domain. Various versions of maximum
principles and comparison principles are discussed in both continuous and
discrete settings. In the literature, it is well-known that an acute-angled
triangle is sufficient to satisfy the discrete weak maximum principle for pure
isotropic diffusion. An iterative algorithm is developed to construct
simplicial meshes that preserves discrete maximum principles using existing
open source mesh generators. Various numerical examples based on different
types of triangulations are presented to show the pros and cons of placing
restrictions on a computational mesh. We also quantify local and global mass
conservation errors using representative numerical examples, and illustrate the
performance of metric-based meshes with respect to mass conservation.

challenging in the presence of hidden nonlinearities, where traditional
eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading. We introduce a novel approach to
matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the data
invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features can be used
to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only on the relative
ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity of pyramidal neurons
in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was exploring a two-dimensional
environment, and confirmed that our method is able to detect geometric
organization using only the intrinsic pattern of neural correlations.
Remarkably, we found similar results during non-spatial behaviors such as wheel
running and REM sleep. This suggests that the geometric structure of
correlations is shaped by the underlying hippocampal circuits, and is not
merely a consequence of position coding. We propose that clique topology is a
powerful new tool for matrix analysis in biological settings, where the
relationship of observed quantities to more meaningful variables is often
nonlinear and unknown.

properties also exhibited unique variability in 2010, suggesting the presence
of systematic component of polarization and magnetic field alignment for the
emergence of a new polarized emission region. In contrast, in 2011 the
variability in the X-ray band was smaller, and the variability in the optical

the result of energy injection into the emitting regions with an aligned

four co-bipartite graphs, and one unit interval graph. Equivalently, any planar

metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) is the use of
high-k dielectrics, which provide the same equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) as
$\rm SiO_2$, but thicker physical layers. However, using a thicker physical
dielectric for the same EOT has a negative effect on the device performance due
to the degradation of 2D electrostatics. In this letter, the effects of high-k
oxides on double-gate (DG) MOSFET with the gate length under 20 nm are studied.
We find that there is an optimum physical oxide thickness ($\rm T_{OX}$) for
each gate stack, including $\rm SiO_2$ interface layer and one high-k material.
For the same EOT, $\rm Al_2O_3$ (k=9) over 3 $\rm\AA$ $\rm SiO_2$ provides the
best performance, while for $\rm HfO_2$ (k=20) and $\rm La_2O_3$ (k=30), $\rm
SiO_2$ thicknesses should be 5 $\rm\AA$ and 7 $\rm\AA$, respectively. The
effects of using high-k oxides and gate stacks on the performance of
ultra-scaled MOSFETs are analyzed. While thin oxide thickness increases the
gate leakage, the thick oxide layer reduces the gate control on the channel.
Therefore, the physical thicknesses of gate stack should be optimized to
achieve the best performance.

other basic parameters related to learning and teaching. Namely, the quality of
sample compression schemes and of teaching sets for classes of low
VC-dimension. Let $C$ be a binary concept class of size $m$ and VC-dimension
$d$. Prior to this work, the best known upper bounds for both parameters were
$\log(m)$, while the best lower bounds are linear in $d$. We present
significantly better upper bounds on both as follows. Set $k = O(d 2^d \log
\log |C|)$.
  We show that there always exists a concept $c$ in $C$ with a teaching set
(i.e. a list of $c$-labeled examples uniquely identifying $c$ in $C$) of size
$k$. This problem was studied by Kuhlmann (1999). Our construction implies that
the recursive teaching (RT) dimension of $C$ is at most $k$ as well. The
RT-dimension was suggested by Zilles et al. and Doliwa et al. (2010). The same
notion (under the name partial-ID width) was independently studied by Wigderson
and Yehudayoff (2013). An upper bound on this parameter that depends only on
$d$ is known just for the very simple case $d=1$, and is open even for $d=2$.
We also make small progress towards this seemingly modest goal.
  We further construct sample compression schemes of size $k$ for $C$, with
additional information of $k \log(k)$ bits. Roughly speaking, given any list of
$C$-labelled examples of arbitrary length, we can retain only $k$ labeled
examples in a way that allows to recover the labels of all others examples in
the list, using additional $k\log (k)$ information bits. This problem was first
suggested by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986).

design in high dimensions called two-stage Sampling, Prediction and Adaptive
Regression via Correlation Screening (SPARCS). SPARCS can be applied to high
dimensional prediction problems in experimental science, medicine, finance, and
engineering, as illustrated by the following. Suppose one wishes to run a
sequence of experiments to learn a sparse multivariate predictor of a dependent
variable $Y$ (disease prognosis for instance) based on a $p$ dimensional set of
independent variables $\mathbf X=[X_1,\ldots, X_p]^T$ (assayed biomarkers).
Assume that the cost of acquiring the full set of variables $\mathbf X$
increases linearly in its dimension. SPARCS breaks the data collection into two
stages in order to achieve an optimal tradeoff between sampling cost and
predictor performance. In the first stage we collect a few ($n$) expensive
samples $\{y_i,\mathbf x_i\}_{i=1}^n$, at the full dimension $p\gg n$ of
$\mathbf X$, winnowing the number of variables down to a smaller dimension $l <
p$ using a type of cross-correlation or regression coefficient screening. In
the second stage we collect a larger number $(t-n)$ of cheaper samples of the
$l$ variables that passed the screening of the first stage. At the second
stage, a low dimensional predictor is constructed by solving the standard
regression problem using all $t$ samples of the selected variables. SPARCS is
an adaptive online algorithm that implements false positive control on the
selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to
high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for the Familywise Error Rate
(FWER), specify high dimensional convergence rates for support recovery, and
establish optimal sample allocation rules to the first and second stages.

approach. Its efficiency stems in part from a property for Minkowski sums of
polygons with holes, which in fact holds in any dimension: Given two polygons
with holes, for each input polygon we can fill up the holes that are relatively
small compared to the other polygon. Specifically, we can always fill up all
the holes of at least one polygon, transforming it into a simple polygon, and
still obtain exactly the same Minkowski sum. Obliterating holes in the input
summands speeds up the computation of Minkowski sums.
  We introduce a robust implementation of the new algorithm, which follows the
Exact Geometric Computation paradigm and thus guarantees exact results. We also

arises in almost every scientific field. Given a sequence of null hypotheses
$\mathcal{H}(n) = (H_1,..., H_n)$, Benjamini and Hochberg
\cite{benjamini1995controlling} introduced the false discovery rate (FDR)
criterion, which is the expected proportion of false positives among rejected
null hypotheses, and proposed a testing procedure that controls FDR below a
pre-assigned significance level. They also proposed a different criterion,
called mFDR, which does not control a property of the realized set of tests;
rather it controls the ratio of expected number of false discoveries to the
expected number of discoveries.
  In this paper, we propose two procedures for multiple hypotheses testing that
we will call ""LOND"" and ""LORD"". These procedures control FDR and mFDR in an
\emph{online manner}. Concretely, we consider an ordered --possibly infinite--
sequence of null hypotheses $\mathcal{H} = (H_1,H_2,H_3,...)$ where, at each
step $i$, the statistician must decide whether to reject hypothesis $H_i$
having access only to the previous decisions. To the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first that controls FDR in this setting. This model was introduced
by Foster and Stine \cite{alpha-investing} whose alpha-investing rule only
controls mFDR in online manner.
  In order to compare different procedures, we develop lower bounds on the
total discovery rate under the mixture model and prove that both LOND and LORD
have nearly linear number of discoveries. We further propose adjustment to LOND
to address arbitrary correlation among the $p$-values. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of our procedures on both synthetic and real data comparing them
with alpha-investing rule, Benjamin-Hochberg method and a Bonferroni procedure.

Cs2SnI6, a rarely studied perovskite variant material, is recently gaining a
lot of interest in the field of photovoltaics owing to its nontoxity,
air-stability and promissing photovoltaic properties. In this work, we report
intrinsic defects in Cs2SnI6 using first-principles density functional theory
calculations. It is revealed that iodine vacancy and tin interstitial are the
dominant defects that are responsible for the intrinsic n-type conduction in
Cs2SnI6. Tin vacancy has a very high formation energy (>3.6 eV) due to the
strong covalency in the Sn-I bonds and is hardly generated for p-type doping.
All the dominant defects in Cs2SnI6 have deep transition levels in the band
gap. It is suggested that the formation of the deep defects can be suppressed
significantly by employing an I-rich synthesis condition, which is inevitable
for photovoltaic and other semiconductor applications.

state results from the competing preferences of the players over the set of

state preparation in general as being the output of some appropriately chosen

construct a suitable notional game that produces some desired output state as
its equilibrium state may lead to different methodologies and insights. With
this goal in mind we examine the notion of preference in quantum games since if
we are interested in the production of a particular equilibrium output state,
it is the competing preferences of the players that determine this equilibrium
state. We show that preferences on output states can be viewed in certain cases
as being induced by measurement with an appropriate set of numerical
weightings, or payoffs, attached to the results of that measurement. In
particular we show that a distance-based preference measure on the output
states is equivalent to a having a strictly-competitive set of payoffs on the
results of some measurement.

of the regularization. In addition, we show how regularization can create
another type of limit cycle that does not appear to be present in the original

Hopf bifurcation that gives rise to periodic orbits is strongly dependent on
the precise form of the regularization. Finally, we analyse the limit cycles as

direct measurement of astronomical distances more accurately simply from their
geometry of light curves. The accurate value of Hubble constant (H0) which

of these 30 eclipsing binaries, only one was found to be detached binary system

binaries were further classified into the A-type and W-type based on their mass
ratios. Since spectroscopic mass ratio measurements were not available for any
of these binary stars, we determined the mass ratios through photometric light

for optimal transport (i.e. Wasserstein) metrics. These flows have proved
useful to tackle theoretically and numerically non-linear diffusion equations
that model for instance porous media or crowd evolutions. These gradient flows
define a suitable notion of weak solutions for these evolutions and they can be
approximated in a stable way using discrete flows. These discrete flows are
implicit Euler time stepping according to the Wasserstein metric. A bottleneck
of these approaches is the high computational load induced by the resolution of
each step. Indeed, this corresponds to the resolution of a convex optimization
problem involving a Wasserstein distance to the previous iterate. Following
several recent works on the approximation of Wasserstein distances, we consider
a discrete flow induced by an entropic regularization of the transportation
coupling. This entropic regularization allows one to trade the initial
Wasserstein fidelity term for a Kulback-Leibler divergence, which is easier to
deal with numerically. We show how KL proximal schemes, and in particular
Dykstra's algorithm, can be used to compute each step of the regularized flow.
The resulting algorithm is both fast, parallelizable and versatile, because it
only requires multiplications by a Gibbs kernel. On Euclidean domains
discretized on an uniform grid, this corresponds to a linear filtering (for
instance a Gaussian filtering when $c$ is the squared Euclidean distance) which
can be computed in nearly linear time. On more general domains, such as
(possibly non-convex) shapes or on manifolds discretized by a triangular mesh,
following a recently proposed numerical scheme for optimal transport, this
Gibbs kernel multiplication is approximated by a short-time heat diffusion.

cancer therapies. The certification is defined in terms of two key issues which
are the tumor contraction and the lower admissible bound on the circulating
lymphocytes which is viewed as indicator of the patient health. The
certification is viewed as the ability to guarantee with a predefined high
probability the success of the therapy over a finite horizon despite of the
unavoidable high uncertainties affecting the dynamic model that is used to
compute the optimal scheduling of drugs injection. The certification paradigm
can be viewed as a tool for tuning the treatment parameters and protocols as

provide a graph-based interpretation of our method, where the SOS recursive

diseases with lower transmission probabilities to persist and spread. Here, we
point out that for real world applications, this result should not be regarded
independently of the intra-individual heterogeneity between people. Our results
show that, if heterogeneity among people is taken into account, networks that
are more heterogeneous in connectivity can be more resistant to epidemic
spreading. We study a susceptible-infected-susceptible model with adaptive
disease avoidance. Results from this model suggest that this reversal of the
effect of network heterogeneity is likely to occur in populations in which the
individuals are aware of their subjective disease risk. For epidemiology, this
implies that network heterogeneity should not be studied in isolation.

infinite size of the class of all irregular objects and behaviors. Thus no (or
by far not enough) abnormal training samples are available and we need to find
abnormalities in test data without actually knowing what they are.
Nevertheless, the prevailing concept of the field is to directly search for
individual abnormal local patches or image regions independent of another. To
address this problem, we propose a method for joint detection of abnormalities
in videos by spatio-temporal video parsing. The goal of video parsing is to
find a set of indispensable normal spatio-temporal object hypotheses that
jointly explain all the foreground of a video, while, at the same time, being
supported by normal training samples. Consequently, we avoid a direct detection
of abnormalities and discover them indirectly as those hypotheses which are
needed for covering the foreground without finding an explanation for
themselves by normal samples. Abnormalities are localized by MAP inference in a
graphical model and we solve it efficiently by formulating it as a convex
optimization problem. We experimentally evaluate our approach on several
challenging benchmark sets, improving over the state-of-the-art on all standard
benchmarks both in terms of abnormality classification and localization.

Zograf, who studied the case where the number of faces is bounded, in the
equivalent formalism of dessins d'enfants. Our proofs borrow some ideas from
Eynard's ""topological recursion"" that he applied in particular to even-faced
maps (unconventionally called ""bipartite maps"" in his work). However, the
present paper requires no previous knowledge of this topic and comes with
elementary (complex-analysis-free) proofs written in the perspective of formal
power series.

components is to take the usual finite mixture model with Dirichlet weights,
and put a prior on the number of components---that is, to use a mixture of
finite mixtures (MFM). While inference in MFMs can be done with methods such as
reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, it is much more common to use
Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models because of the relative ease and
generality with which DPM samplers can be applied. In this paper, we show that,
in fact, many of the attractive mathematical properties of DPMs are also
exhibited by MFMs---a simple exchangeable partition distribution, restaurant
process, random measure representation, and in certain cases, a stick-breaking
representation. Consequently, the powerful methods developed for inference in
DPMs can be directly applied to MFMs as well. We illustrate with simulated and
real data, including high-dimensional gene expression data.

parallel quantum dots embedded in a short quantum wire in a photon cavity can
trigger coupled Rabi and collective electron-photon oscillations. We select the
initial state of the system to be an eigenstate of the closed system containing
two Coulomb interacting electrons with possibly few photons of a single cavity
mode. The many-level quantum dots are described by a continuous potential. The
Coulomb interaction and the para- and dia-magnetic electron-photon interactions
are treated by exact diagonalization in a truncated Fock-space. To identify the
collective modes the results are compared for an open and a closed system with
respect to the coupling to external electron reservoirs, or leads. We
demonstrate that the vacuum Rabi oscillations can be seen in transport
quantities as the current in and out of the system.

and Nicole in ""Logique ou l'art de penser"". They were the first, who
distinguished between the volume of the concept and its structure. They created
a tradition which was strong in math till XIX century, especially in France.
The definitions were in binomial nomenclature mostly, but another type of
definition appears in Cantor theory - it was the descriptive definition. As it
used to be in human sciences, first the object had only one characteristic,
then as the research continued it enriched with new characteristics so we have
full-fledged conception. In this way the mathematics acquired its own
creativity. In 1915 Lusin laid down a new principle of the descriptive theory:
a structural characteristic is done, the analytical form had to be found. New
schools of descriptive set theory appeared in Moscow in the first half of the
20th century.
