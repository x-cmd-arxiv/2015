  of Computing (STOC 2015)",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For many online problems, it is known that the uniform arrival order enables
the design of algorithms with much better performance guarantees than under
worst-case. The quintessential example is the secretary problem. If the
sequence of elements is presented in uniformly random order there is an
algorithm that picks the maximum value with probability 1/e, whereas no
non-trivial performance guarantee is possible if the elements arrive in
worst-case order. This work initiates an investigation into relaxations of the
random-ordering hypothesis in online algorithms, by focusing on the secretary
problems. We present two sets of properties of distributions over permutations
as sufficient conditions, called the block-independence property and
uniform-induced-ordering property. We show these two are asymptotically
equivalent by borrowing some techniques from the approximation theory.
Moreover, we show they both imply the existence of secretary algorithms with
constant probability of correct selection, approaching the optimal constant 1/e
in the limit. We substantiate our idea by providing several constructions of
distributions that satisfy block-independence. We also show that {\Theta}(log
log n) is the minimum entropy of any permutation distribution that permits
constant probability of correct selection in the secretary problem with n
elements. While our block-independence condition is sufficient for constant
probability of correct selection, it is not necessary; however, we present
complexity-theoretic evidence that no simple necessary and sufficient criterion
exists. Finally, we explore the extent to which the performance guarantees of
other algorithms are preserved when one relaxes the uniform random ordering
assumption, obtaining a positive result for Kleinberg's multiple-choice
secretary algorithm and a negative result for the weighted bipartite matching
algorithm of Korula and Pal.

Room-temperature mechanical properties of the mixed-conducting perovskite
material LSCF6428 were investigated by nanoindentation of porous bulk samples
and porous films sintered at temperatures from 900-1200C. A spherical indenter
was used so that the contact area was much greater than the scale of the porous
microstructure. The elastic modulus of the bulk samples was found to increase
from 33.8-174.3 GPa and hardness from 0.64-5.32 GPa as the porosity decreased
from 45-5% after sintering at 900-1200C. Densification under the indenter was
found to have little influence on the measured elastic modulus. The residual
porosity in the dense sample was found to account for the discrepancy between
the elastic moduli measured by indentation and by impulse excitation.
Crack-free LSCF6428 films of acceptable surface roughness for indentation were
also prepared by sintering at 900-1200C. Reliable measurements of the true
properties of the films were obtained by data extrapolation provided that the
ratio of indentation depth to film thickness was in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The
elastic moduli of the films and bulk materials were approximately equal for a
given porosity. The 3D microstructures of films before and after indentation
were characterized using FIB-SEM tomography. Finite element modelling of the
elastic deformation of the actual microstructures showed excellent agreement
with the nanoindentation results.

It
can be computed by partition methods, or by estimating the growth rate of

the velocity field, which is not always available, such as when we only know a
few particle trajectories (ocean float data, for example). We propose an
alternative approximation to topological entropy,applicable to two-dimensional
flows, which uses only a finite number of trajectories as input data. To
represent these sparse data sets, we use braids, algebraic objects that record
how strands, i.e., trajectories, exchange positions with respect to a
projection axis. Material curves advected by the flow are represented as
simplified loop coordinates. The exponential rate at which a braid deforms
loops over a finite time interval as the strands exchange places is the
Finite-Time Braiding Exponent (FTBE) and serves as a proxy for topological
entropy of the two-dimensional flow. We demonstrate that FTBEs are robust with
respect to the value of numerical time step,details of braid representation,
and choice of initial conditions inside the mixing region. We also explore how
closely the FTBEs approximate topological entropy depending on the number and
length of trajectories used.

particles. While the tracer particle always stays on the lattice, crowder
particles may unbind to a surrounding bulk and rebind at another or the same
location. In this scenario we determine how the long time diffusion constant
${\cal D}$ (after many unbinding events) depends on (i) the unbinding rate of
crowder particles $k_{\rm off}$, and (ii) crowder particle line density $\rho$,
from simulations (Gillespie algorithm) and analytical calculations. For small
$k_{\rm off}$, we find ${\cal D}\sim k_{\rm off}/\rho^2$ when crowder particles
are immobile on the line, and ${\cal D}\sim \sqrt{D k_{\rm off}}/\rho$ when
they are diffusing; $D$ is the free particle diffusion constant. For large
$k_{\rm off}$, we find agreement with mean-field results which do not depend on
$k_{\rm off}$. From literature values of $k_{\rm off}$ and $D$, we show that
the small $k_{\rm off}$-limit is relevant for in vivo protein diffusion on a

with a waveguide reflectometer: a section of transmission line with
microphones, a signal source, and an absorbing termination. When the mean flow
from the air-jet into the transmission line is not blocked, the air-jet
amplifier is unstable to edge-tone oscillations through a feedback path that

solved by using convex optimization techniques and the proposed optimization

modeling near-field radiative heat transfer in complex three-dimensional
geometries. In this work, the convergence of the T-DDA is investigated by
comparison against the exact results for two spheres separated by a vacuum gap.
The error associated with the T-DDA is reported for various sphere sizes,
refractive indices and vacuum gap thicknesses. The results reveal that for a
fixed number of subvolumes, the accuracy of the T-DDA degrades as the
refractive index and the sphere diameter to gap ratio increase. A converging
trend is observed as the number of subvolumes increases. The large
computational requirements associated with increasing the number of subvolumes,
and the shape error induced by large sphere diameter to gap ratios, are
mitigated by using a nonuniform discretization scheme. Nonuniform
discretization is shown to significantly accelerate the convergence of the
T-DDA, and is thus recommended for near-field thermal radiation simulations.
Errors less than 5% are obtained in 74% of the cases studied by using up to
82712 subvolumes. Additionally, the convergence analysis demonstrates that the
T-DDA is very accurate when dealing with surface polariton resonant modes
dominating radiative heat transfer in the near field.

A short introduction in Game Theory and coalitions illustrate the way any
collective decision scheme can be viewed as a competitive game of coalitions
that are formed naturally when players state their preferences. The winning
conditions and the voting power of each player are studied under the scope of
voting power indices, as well and the collective competence of the group.
Coalitions and power indices are presented in relation to the Condorcet
criterion of optimality in voting systems, and weighted Borda count models are
asserted as a way to implement them in practice. A special case of coalition
games, the weighted majority games (WMG) are presented as a restricted
realization in dichotomy choice situations. As a result, the weighted majority
rules (WMR), an extended version of the simple majority rules, are asserted as
the theoretically optimal and complete solution to this type of coalition
gaming. Subsequently, a generalized version of WMRs is suggested as the means
to design a voting system that is optimal in the sense of both the correct
classification criterion and the Condorcet efficiency criterion. In the scope
of Pattern Recognition, a generalized risk-based approach is proposed as the
framework upon which any classifier combination scheme can be applied. A new
fully adaptive version of WMRs is proposed as a statistically invariant way of
adjusting the design process of the optimal WMR to the arbitrary
non-symmetrical properties of the underlying feature space. SVM theory is
associated with properties and conclusions that emerge from the game-theoretic
approach of the classification in general, while the theoretical and practical
implications of employing SVM experts in WMR combination schemes are briefly
discussed. Finally, a summary of the most important issues for further research
is presented.

Even in this elementary example, where the exact ground-state energy and site
occupations can be found analytically, there is much to be explained in terms
of the underlying logic and aims of Density Functional Theory. Although the
usual solution is analytic, the density functional is given only implicitly. We
overcome this difficulty using the Levy-Lieb construction to create a
parametrization of the exact function with negligible errors. The symmetric
case is most commonly studied, but we find a rich variation in behavior by
including asymmetry, as strong correlation physics vies with charge-transfer
effects. We explore the behavior of the gap and the many-body Green's function,
demonstrating the `failure' of the Kohn-Sham method to reproduce the
fundamental gap. We perform benchmark calculations of the occupation and
components of the KS potentials, the correlation kinetic energies, and the
adiabatic connection. We test several approximate functionals (restricted and
unrestricted Hartree-Fock and Bethe Ansatz Local Density Approximation) to show
their successes and limitations. We also discuss and illustrate the concept of
the derivative discontinuity. Useful appendices include analytic expressions

resonance with symmetries, which include several models of perturbed Keplerian
systems. Normal forms are computed in Poisson and symplectic formalisms, by
mean of invariants and Lie-transforms respectively. The first procedure relies
on the quadratic invariants associated to the symmetries, and is carried out
using Gr\""obner bases. In the symplectic approach, hinging on the maximally
superintegrable character of the isotropic oscillator, the normal form is
computed {\it a la} Delaunay, using a generalization of those variables for
4-DOF systems. Due to the symmetries of the system, isolated as well as circles
of stationary points and invariant tori should be expected. These solutions
manifest themselves rather differently in both approaches, due to the
constraints among the invariants versus the singularities associated to the
Delaunay chart.
  Taking the generalized van der Waals family as a benchmark, the explicit
expression of the Delaunay normalized Hamiltonian up to the second order is
presented, showing that it may be extended to higher orders in a
straightforward way. The search for the relative equilibria is used for
comparison of their main features of both treatments. The pros and cons are
given in detail for some values of the parameter and the integrals.

number of colours available, $q$, the number of lights on each robot, $k$, and
the number of consecutive lights the camera can see, $\ell$. For a given set of
parameters, we would like to maximise the number of robots that we can use. We
model this as a combinatorial problem and show that it is equivalent to finding
the maximum number of disjoint $k$-cycles in the de Bruijn graph
$\text{dB}(q,\ell)$.
  We provide several existence results that give the maximum number of cycles
in $\text{dB}(q,\ell)$ in various cases. For example, we give an optimal
solution when $k=q^{\ell-1}$. Another construction yields many cycles in larger
de Bruijn graphs using cycles from smaller de Bruijn graphs: if
$\text{dB}(q,\ell)$ can be partitioned into $k$-cycles, then
$\text{dB}(q,\ell)$ can be partitioned into $tk$-cycles for any divisor $t$ of

there is the possibility of stable dark matter without additional symmetry.
This applies to many existing simple models of Majorana neutrino mass with dark
matter, including some radiative models. Several well-known examples are
discussed. This new insight leads to the construction of a radiative Type II
seesaw model of neutrino mass with dark matter where the dominant decay of the

lens models is not necessarily consistent among the various software available,
suggesting that the use of several models may enhance the understanding of the
system being studied. Among the publicly available codes, the model input files
are heterogeneous, making the creation of multiple models tedious. An enhanced
method of creating model files and a method to easily create multiple models,
may increase the number of comparison studies. HydraLens simplifies the
creation of model files for four strong gravitational lens model software
packages, including Lenstool, Gravlens/Lensmodel, glafic and PixeLens, using a
custom designed GUI for each of the four codes that simplifies the entry of the
model for each of these codes, obviating the need for user manuals to set the
values of the many flags and in each data field. HydraLens is designed in a
modular fashion, which simplifies the addition of other strong gravitational
lens codes in the future. HydraLens can also translate a model generated for
any of these four software packages into any of the other three. Models created
using HydraLens may require slight modifications, since some information may be
lost in the translation process. However the computer generated model greatly
simplifies the process of developing multiple lens models. HydraLens may
enhance the number of direct software comparison studies, and also assist in
the education of young investigators in gravitational lens modeling. Future
development of HydraLens will further enhance its capabilities.

from the standpoint of the underlying chiral symmetry. The Bloch quasiparticles
in low energy limit, around the degeneracy points are dominantly chiral. It is
shown for the first time that this chiral behavior in conjunction with scale
invariance in graphene around the Dirac points results in the strong nonlinear
optical response. Explicit expressions for the linear and nonlinear
conductivity tensors are derived based on Semiconductor Bloch Equations (SBEs).
The linear terms agree with the result of Kubo formulation. The three main
additive mechanisms contribute in the nonlinear optical response of graphene:
pure intraband, pure interband and the interplay between them. For each
contribution, an explicit response function is derived. The Kerr-type
nonlinearity of graphene is then studied and it is demonstrated that its Kerr
nonlinear coefficient is several orders of magnitude higher than that of many
other known semiconductors. In addition, the nonlinear refractive index of
graphene can also be tuned and enhanced by applying a gate voltage.

response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been
partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many
bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses due
to factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new
generations of storage devices have emerged, such as NAND flash-based
solid-state drives (SSDs), and with the renewed interest in near-data
processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can
accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement
of hard disk drives (HDDs) by SSDs results in dramatic speedup. Despite the
various advantages and continuous cost reduction of SSDs, there has been little
review of SSD-based profiling and performance exploration of important but
time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform
in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using
multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research,
we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics
algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit SSDs. The programs we profile cover
traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly,
mapping, expression analysis, variant calling, and metagenomics. We explain how
acceleration by parallelization can be combined with SSDs for improved
performance and also how using SSDs can expedite important bioinformatics
pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and
transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We hope that this review
can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics
algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful
storage devices.

user-generated short video streaming services, has become popular in today's
Internet. Cloud-based hosting of such instant social video contents has become
a norm to serve the increasing users with user-generated contents. A
fundamental problem of cloud-based social video sharing service is that users
are located globally, who cannot be served with good service quality with a
single cloud provider. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
dispersing instant social video contents to multiple cloud providers. The
challenge is that inter-cloud social \emph{propagation} is indispensable with
such multi-cloud social video hosting, yet such inter-cloud traffic incurs
substantial operational cost. We analyze and formulate the multi-cloud hosting
of an instant social video system as an optimization problem. We conduct
large-scale measurement studies to show the characteristics of instant social
video deployment, and demonstrate the trade-off between satisfying users with
their ideal cloud providers, and reducing the inter-cloud data propagation. Our
measurement insights of the social propagation allow us to propose a heuristic
algorithm with acceptable complexity to solve the optimization problem, by
partitioning a propagation-weighted social graph in two phases: a
preference-aware initial cloud provider selection and a propagation-aware
re-hosting. Our simulation experiments driven by real-world social network
traces show the superiority of our design.

been proven to be effective but also brings about lattice disorder. Such
disorder can completely destroy superconductivity even at a fixed doping level.
Pressure has been thought to be the most clean method for tuning
superconductivity. However, pressure-induced increase of disorder was
recognized from recent experiments. By choosing a disordered
Tl$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ at the optimal doping, we perform
single-crystal x-ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility measurements at
high pressures. The obtained structural data provides evidence for the robust
feature for the disorder of this material in the pressure range studied. This
feature ensures the pressure effects on superconductivity distinguishable from
the disorder. The derived parabolic-like behavior of the transition temperature
with pressure up to near 30 GPa, having a maximum around 7 GPa, offers a
platform for testing any realistic theoretical models in a nearly constant
disorder environment. Such a behavior can be understood when considering the
carrier concentration and the pairing interaction strength as two pressure

which electron-electron (Coulomb) collisions play an essential role - is
analyzed here for Xe with a Boltzmann equation approach and with a first
principles particle simulation method. The solution of the Boltzmann equation
adopts the usual approximations of (i) searching for the distribution function
in the form of two terms (""two-term approximation""), (ii) neglecting the
Coulomb part of the collision integral for the anisotropic part of the
distribution function, (iii) treating Coulomb collisions as binary events, and
(iv) truncating the range of the electron-electron interaction beyond a
characteristic distance. The particle-based simulation method avoids these
approximations: the many-body interactions within the electron gas with a true
(un- truncated) Coulomb potential are described by a Molecular Dynamics
algorithm, while the collisions between electrons and the background gas atoms
are treated with Monte Carlo simulation. We find a good general agreement
between the results of the two techniques, which confirms, to a certain extent,
the approximations used in the solution of the Boltzmann equation. The
differences observed between the results are believed to originate from these
approximations and from the presence of statistical noise in the particle
simulations.

SLC-type NAND flash chips, the read and write speeds of the proposed

the proposed architecture with the way-interleaving technique that multiplexes
the data channel between the controller and each flash chip. For a reasonably
high degree of way interleaving, the read/write performance and the energy

queries and the context-free path queries, are usually evaluated to a relation
of node-pairs $(m, n)$ such that there is a path from $m$ to $n$ satisfying the
conditions of the query. Although this relational query semantics has practical
value, we believe that the relational query semantics can only provide limited
insight in the structure of the graph data. To address the limits of the
relational query semantics, we introduce the all-path query semantics and the
single-path query semantics. Under these path-based query semantics, a query is
evaluated to all paths satisfying the conditions of the query, or,
respectively, to a single such path.
  While focusing on context-free path queries, we provide a formal framework
for evaluating queries on graphs using both path-based query semantics. For the
all-path query semantics, we show that the result of a query can be represented
by a finite context-free grammar annotated with node-information relevant for
deriving each path in the query result. For the single-path query semantics, we
propose to search for a path of minimum length. We reduce the problem of
finding such a path of minimum length to finding a string of minimum length in
a context-free language, and for deriving such a string we propose a novel
algorithm.
  Our initial results show that the path-based query semantics have added
practical value and that query evaluation for both path-based query semantics
is feasible, even when query results grow very large. For the single-path query
semantics, determining strict worst-case upper bounds on the size of the query
result remains the focus of future work.

than a day. We studied intraday variations by applying a shot analysis
technique to Kepler monitoring of blazar W2R 1926+42 in Quarter 14. We obtained
a mean profile calculated from 195 rapid variations. The mean profile shows
three components; one is a sharp structure distributed within $\pm$0.1 day of
the peak, and two slow-varying components. This spiky-peak component reflects
features of rapid variations directly. The profile of peak component shows an
exponential rise and decay of which timescales are different, 0.0416 and 0.0588
day respectively. This component is too sharp to represent a standard function
which is often used to express blazar variations. This asymmetric profile at
the peak is difficult to be explained by a simple variation of the Doppler
factor by changing a geometry of the emitting region. This result indicates
that intraday variations arise from a production of high-energy accelerated
particles in the jet.

representative of structural data, low rank matrix along with its restricted

signal processing. Subspace projection matrix is a kind of low rank matrix with
additional structure, which allows for further reduction of its intrinsic
dimension. This leaves room for improving its own RIP, which could work as the
foundation of compressed subspace projection matrix recovery. In this work, we
study the RIP of subspace projection matrix under random orthonormal
compression. Considering the fact that subspace projection matrices of $s$
dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^N$ form an $s(N-s)$ dimensional
submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$, our main concern is transformed to the
stable embedding of such submanifold into $\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$. The result
is that by $O(s(N-s)\log N)$ number of random measurements the RIP of subspace

general nonlinear network dynamics, in particular of consensus dynamics. It is
shown how by starting from the complex-balanced assumption the reaction
dynamics governed by mass action kinetics can be rewritten into a form which
allows for a very simple derivation of a number of key results in chemical
reaction network theory, and which directly relates to the thermodynamics of
the system. Central in this formulation is the definition of a balanced
Laplacian matrix on the graph of chemical complexes together with a resulting
fundamental inequality. This directly leads to the characterization of the set
of equilibria and their stability. Both the form of the dynamics and the

number. It is shown that a nonlinear network based upon Fibonacci and figurate
superlattices provides better parallel filtration of a half-tone picture than a

policy from pixel information only. We introduce a data-efficient, model-based
reinforcement learning algorithm that learns such a closed-loop policy directly
from pixel information. The key ingredient is a deep dynamical model that uses
deep auto-encoders to learn a low-dimensional embedding of images jointly with
a predictive model in this low-dimensional feature space. Joint learning
ensures that not only static but also dynamic properties of the data are
accounted for. This is crucial for long-term predictions, which lie at the core
of the adaptive model predictive control strategy that we use for closed-loop
control. Compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods for
continuous states and actions, our approach learns quickly, scales to
high-dimensional state spaces and is an important step toward fully autonomous
learning from pixels to torques.

we have analyzed the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the Seebeck
coefficient ($S$). The large saturation value of $S$ at high field clearly
demonstrates the linear energy dispersion of three-dimensional Dirac fermion. A
wide tunability of the charge scattering mechanism has been realized by varying
the strength of the magnetic field and carrier density via In doping. With the
increase in magnetic field, the scattering time crosses over from being nearly
energy independent to a regime of linear dependence. On the other hand, the
scattering time enters into the inverse energy-dependent regime and the Fermi
surface strongly modifies with 2\% In doping at Cd site. With further increase
in In content from 2 to 4\%, we did not observe any Shubnikov-de Haas

"1502.02265","Menelaos Karavelas","Menelaos I. Karavelas and Eleni Tzanaki","A geometric approach for the upper bound theorem for Minkowski sums of
  convex polytopes","43 pages; minor changes (mostly typos)",,,,"cs.CG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive tight expressions for the maximum number of $k$-faces,
$0\le{}k\le{}d-1$, of the Minkowski sum, $P_1+...+P_r$, of $r$ convex
$d$-polytopes $P_1,...,P_r$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\ge{}2$ and $r<d$, as a
(recursively defined) function on the number of vertices of the polytopes.
  Our results coincide with those recently proved by Adiprasito and Sanyal [2].
In contrast to Adiprasito and Sanyal's approach, which uses tools from
Combinatorial Commutative Algebra, our approach is purely geometric and uses
basic notions such as $f$- and $h$-vector calculus and shellings, and
generalizes the methodology used in [15] and [14] for proving upper bounds on
the $f$-vector of the Minkowski sum of two and three convex polytopes,
respectively.
  The key idea behind our approach is to express the Minkowski sum
$P_1+...+P_r$ as a section of the Cayley polytope $\mathcal{C}$ of the
summands; bounding the $k$-faces of $P_1+...+P_r$ reduces to bounding the
subset of the $(k+r-1)$-faces of $\mathcal{C}$ that contain vertices from each
of the $r$ polytopes.
  We end our paper with a sketch of an explicit construction that establishes
the tightness of the upper bounds.

energy into dense molecular ensembles. Subsequent rotation-translation energy
transfer, mediated by thermal collisions, results in the localized heating of
the gas and generates strong sound wave, clearly audible to the unaided ear.
For the first time, the amplitude of the sound signal is analyzed as a function
of the experimentally measured rotational energy. The proportionality between
the two experimental observables confirms that rotational excitation is the
main source of the detected sound wave. As virtually all molecules, including
the main constituents of the atmosphere, are amenable to laser spinning by the
centrifuge, we anticipate this work to stimulate further development in the
area of photo-acoustic control and spectroscopy.

Hamiltonian in a spinorbit coupled system into slow orbital motion and fast
interband transition process. We find that the fast motion induces a gauge
field on slow orbital motion, perpendicular to electron momentum, inducing a
topological phase. From this general designing principle, we present a theory
for generating artificial gauge field and topological phase in a conventional
two-dimensional electron gas embedded in parabolically graded
GaAs/In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs quantum wells with antidot lattices. By tuning
the etching depth and period of antidot lattices, the band folding caused by
superimposed potential leads to formation of minibands and band inversions
between the neighboring subbands. The intersubband spin-orbit interaction opens
considerably large nontrivial minigaps and leads to many pairs of helical edge
states in these gaps.

cricket matches of different teams using methods of random matrix theory (RMT).
We obtain an ensemble of cross-correlation matrices $C$ from runs scored by
eight cricket playing nations for (i) test cricket from 1877 -2014 (ii)one-day
internationals from 1971 -2014 and (iii) seven teams participating in the
Indian Premier league T20 format (2008-2014) respectively. We find that a
majority of the eigenvalues of C fall within the bounds of random matrices
having joint probability distribution $P(x_1...,x_n)=C_{N \beta} \,
\prod_{j<k}w(x_j)| x_j-x_k |^\beta$ where $w(x)=x^{N\beta a}\exp(-N\beta b x)$
and $\beta$ is the Dyson parameter. The corresponding level density gives
Marchenko-Pastur (MP) distribution while fluctuations of every participating
team agrees with the universal behavior of Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We
analyze the components of the deviating eigenvalues and find that the largest
eigenvalue corresponds to an influence common to all matches played during
these periods.
