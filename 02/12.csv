crossed-beam geometry. In the usual arrangement, an off-axis gating pulse
induces birefringence in a medium exhibiting a strong Kerr response (commonly
carbon disulfide) which is followed by a polarizer aligned to fully attenuate
the on-axis imaging beam. By properly timing the gate pulse, imaging light
experiences a polarization change allowing time-dependent transmission through
the polarizer to form an ultrashort image. The crossed-beam system is effective
in generating short gate times, however, signal transmission through the system
is complicated by the crossing angle of the gate and imaging beams. This work
presents a robust ultrafast time-gated imaging scheme based on a combination of
type-I frequency doubling and a collinear optical arrangement in carbon
disulfide. We discuss spatial effects arising from crossed-beam Kerr gating,
and examine the imaging spatial resolution and transmission timing affected by
collinear activation of the Kerr medium, which eliminates crossing angle
spatial effects and produces gate times on the order of 1 ps. In addition, the
collinear, two-color system is applied to image structure in an optical fiber
and a gasoline fuel spray, in order to demonstrate image formation utilizing
ballistic or refracted light, selected on the basis of its transmission time.

Wigner function violates several important requirements. Consequently, we
transfer the conjecture to the Fourier transform of the Wigner function, that
is, the chord function. We show that all the relevant consequences of the usual
conjecture require only information contained within a small (Planck) volume
around the origin of the phase space of chords: translations in ordinary phase
space. Loci of complete orthogonality between a given eigenstate and its nearby
translation are quite elusive for the Wigner function, but our local conjecture
stipulates that their pattern should be universal for ergodic eigenstates of
the same Hamiltonian lying within a classically narrow energy range. Our
findings are supported by numerical evidence in a Hamiltonian exhibiting soft
chaos. Heavily scarred eigenstates are remarkable counter-examples of the
ergodic universal pattern.

option prices depend on risk attitudes of individual agents. In this context,
the notion of utility indifference price has gained popularity in the academic
circles. Although theoretically very appealing, this pricing method remains
difficult to apply in practice, due to the high computational cost of solving
the nonlinear partial integro-differential equation associated to the
indifference price. In this work, we develop closed form approximations to
exponential utility indifference prices in exponential L\'evy models. To this
end, we first establish a new non-asymptotic approximation of the indifference
price which extends earlier results on small risk aversion asymptotics of this
quantity. Next, we use this formula to derive a closed-form approximation of
the indifference price by treating the L\'evy model as a perturbation of the
Black-Scholes model. This extends the methodology introduced in a recent paper
for smooth linear functionals of L\'evy processes (A. \v{C}ern\'y, S. Denkl and
J. Kallsen, arXiv:1309.7833) to nonlinear and non-smooth functionals. Our
closed formula represents the indifference price as the linear combination of
the Black-Scholes price and correction terms which depend on the variance,
skewness and kurtosis of the underlying L\'evy process, and the derivatives of
the Black-Scholes price. As a by-product, we obtain a simple explicit formula
for the spread between the buyer's and the seller's indifference price. This

to the origin of the galactic magnetic field under the assumption of perfect

and, because of flux freezing, the mass anchored on this flux also must be
expelled. The strong galactic gravitational field makes this impossible on
energetic grounds. It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable
field lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines
without requiring much energy. This expulsion of only short lines of force can
be accomplished by a spike instability associated with gigantic astrophysical
superbubbles. The physics of this instability is discussed and the results
enable an estimate to be made of the number of spikes in the galaxy. It appears
that there are probably enough spikes to cut all the undesirable lines into
pieces as short as a couple of kiloparsecs during a dynamo time of a billion
years. These cut pieces then may be randomly rotated in a dynamo time by
alpha-Omega diffusion and there is enough rotation to get rid of the
undesirable flux without expelling the fields themselves. The spike process
seems strong enough to allows the alpha-Omega dynamo to create the galactic

increases: i.e. the foam coarsens. During coarsening, bubbles also move
relative to each other, changing bubble topology and shape, while liquid moves
within the regions separating the bubbles. Analyzing the combined effects of
these mechanisms requires examining a volume with enough bubbles to provide
appropriate statistics throughout coarsening. Using a Cellular Potts model, we
simulate these mechanisms during the evolution of three-dimensional foams with
wetnesses of $\phi=0.00$, $0.05$ and $ 0.20$. We represent the liquid phase as
an ensemble of many small fluid particles, which allows us to monitor liquid

  throughout",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past two decades, fair resource allocation problems have received
considerable attention in a variety of application areas. However, little
progress has been made in the design of distributed algorithms with convergence
guarantees for general and commonly used $\alpha$-fair allocations. In this
paper, we study weighted $\alpha$-fair packing problems, that is, the problems
of maximizing the objective functions (i) $\sum_j w_j
x_j^{1-\alpha}/(1-\alpha)$ when $\alpha > 0$, $\alpha \neq 1$ and (ii) $\sum_j
w_j \ln x_j$ when $\alpha = 1$, over linear constraints $Ax \leq b$, $x\geq 0$,
where $w_j$ are positive weights and $A$ and $b$ are non-negative. We consider
the distributed computation model that was used for packing linear programs and
network utility maximization problems. Under this model, we provide a
distributed algorithm for general $\alpha$ that converges to an
$\varepsilon-$approximate solution in time (number of distributed iterations)
that has an inverse polynomial dependence on the approximation parameter
$\varepsilon$ and poly-logarithmic dependence on the problem size. This is the
first distributed algorithm for weighted $\alpha-$fair packing with
poly-logarithmic convergence in the input size. The algorithm uses simple local
update rules and is stateless (namely, it allows asynchronous updates, is
self-stabilizing, and allows incremental and local adjustments). We also obtain
a number of structural results that characterize $\alpha-$fair allocations as
the value of $\alpha$ is varied. These results deepen our understanding of
fairness guarantees in $\alpha-$fair packing allocations, and also provide
insight into the behavior of $\alpha-$fair allocations in the asymptotic cases
$\alpha\rightarrow 0$, $\alpha \rightarrow 1$, and $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$.

massive star forming regions and the updated light curve for the known periodic
source G22.357+0.066. The observations were carried out with the Torun 32 m
radio telescope between June 2009 and April 2014. Flux density variations with
period of 120 to 245 d were detected for some or all spectral features. A
variability pattern with a fast rise and relatively slow fall on time-scale of
30-60 d dominated. A reverse pattern was observed for some features of
G22.357+0.066, while sinusoidal-like variations were detected in G25.411+0.105.
A weak burst lasting ~520 d with the velocity drift of 0.24 km/s/yr occurred in
G22.357+0.066. For three sources for which high resolution maps are available,
we found that the features with periodic behaviour are separated by more than
500 au from those without any periodicity. This suggests that the maser flares
are not triggered by large-scale homogeneous variations in either the
background seed photon flux or the luminosity of the exciting source and a
mechanism which is able to produce local changes in the pumping conditions is
required.

that agents first experience a formative period, in which they adjust their

phase is followed by a period of social influence by reinforcement learning. By
comparing data generated by the agents with data from a sample of 15000 Moral
Foundation questionnaires we found the following. 1. The number of information
exchanges in the formative phase correlates positively with statistics
identifying liberals in the social influence phase. This is consistent with
recent evidence that connects the dopamine receptor D4-7R gene, political
orientation and early age social clique size. 2. The learning algorithms that
result from the formative phase vary in the way they treat novelty and
corroborative information with more conservative-like agents treating it more
equally than liberal-like agents. This is consistent with the correlation
between political affiliation and the Openness personality trait reported in
the literature. 3. Under the increase of a model parameter interpreted as an
external pressure, the statistics of liberal agents resemble more those of
conservative agents, consistent with reports on the consequences of external
threats on measures of conservatism. We also show that in the social influence
phase liberal-like agents readapt much faster than conservative-like agents

the left boundary site driven by a periodically oscillating field with a fixed

theorem in terms of correlation functions of creation and annihilation

is shown that the divergence of the non-conserved conformal current dual to the
bulk gauge field is approximately primary when computing correlators for
theories in which the masses of all the exchanged particles are sufficiently
large. The results are then generalized to higher spin fields.
  We then go on to generalize the theorem using conformal blocks in two and

This trend has prompted services such as Facebook and Google+ to incorporate

based on location such as Foursquare and Shopkick are also growing as
smartphone market penetration increases. In fact, this growth is happening
despite concerns (growing at a similar pace) about security and third-party use
of private location information (e.g., for advertising). Nevertheless, service
providers have been unwilling to build truly private systems in which they do
not have access to location information. In this paper, we describe an
architecture and a trial implementation of a privacy-preserving location
sharing system called Albatross. The system protects location information from
the service provider and yet enables fine-grained location-sharing. One main
feature of the system is to protect an individual's social network structure.
The pattern of location sharing preferences towards contacts can reveal this
structure without any knowledge of the locations themselves. Albatross protects
locations sharing preferences through protocol unification and masking.
Albatross has been implemented as a standalone solution, but the technology can
also be integrated into location-based services to enhance privacy.

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the fourth order nonlinear
Cahn-Hilliard equation. Both methods use the backward Euler method for time
discretization and interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods for spatial
discretization. They differ from each other on how the nonlinear term is
treated, one of them is based on fully implicit time-stepping and the other
uses the energy-splitting time-stepping. The primary goal of the paper is to
prove the convergence of the numerical interfaces of the DG methods to the
interface of the Hele-Shaw flow. This is achieved by establishing error
estimates that depend on $\epsilon^{-1}$ only in some low polynomial orders,
instead of exponential orders. Similar to [14], the crux is to prove a discrete
spectrum estimate in the discontinuous Galerkin finite element space. However,
the validity of such a result is not obvious because the DG space is not a
subspace of the (energy) space $H^1$ and it is larger than the finite element
space. This difficult is overcome by a delicate perturbation argument which
relies on the discrete spectrum estimate in the finite element space proved in
\cite{Feng_Prohl04}. Numerical experiment results are also presented to gauge
the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed fully discrete
mixed DG methods.

source associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy,
show that it behaves as a partially self-absorbed synchrotron-emitting source.
The measured size of Sgr A* shows that the mm-wavelength emission comes from a
small region and consists of the inner accretion flow and a possible collimated
outflow. Existing observations of Sgr A* have revealed a time lag between light
curves at 43 GHz and 22 GHz, which is consistent with a rapidly expanding
plasma flow and supports the presence of a collimated outflow from the
environment of an accreting black hole.
  Here we wish to measure simultaneous frequency-dependent time lags in the
light curves of Sgr A* across a broad frequency range to constrain direction
and speed of the radio-emitting plasma in the vicinity of the black hole. Light
curves of Sgr A* were taken in May 2012 using ALMA at 100 GHz using the VLA at
48, 39, 37, 27, 25.5, and 19 GHz. As a result of elevation limits and the
longitude difference between the stations, the usable overlap in the light
curves is approximately four hours. Although Sgr A* was in a relatively quiet
phase, the high sensitivity of ALMA and the VLA allowed us to detect and fit
maxima of an observed minor flare where flux density varied by ~10%.
  The fitted times of flux density maxima at frequencies from 100 GHz to 19
GHz, as well as a cross-correlation analysis, reveal a simple
frequency-dependent time lag relation where maxima at higher frequencies lead
those at lower frequencies. Taking the observed size-frequency relation of Sgr
A* into account, these time lags suggest a moderately relativistic (lower
estimates: 0.5c for two-sided, 0.77c for one-sided) collimated outflow.

Phys.}, 5:181-188, 2009), observers obtain pointer-state information about
quantum systems by interacting with a local sample of the surrounding
environment, e.g. a local sample of the ambient photon field. Because the
environment encodes such pointer state information uniformly and hence
redundantly throughout its entire volume, the information is equally available
to all observers regardless of their location. This framework is applied to the
observation of stellar center-of-mass positions, which are assumed to be
encoded by the ambient photon field in a way that is uniformly accessible to
all possible observers. Assuming Landauer's Principle, constructing such
environmental encodings requires $(ln2) kT$ per encoded bit. For the observed
10$^{24}$ stars and a uniform binary encoding of center-of-mass positions into
voxels with a linear dimension of 5 km, the free energy required at the current
CMB temperature T = 2.7 K is $\sim$ 2.5 $\cdot$ 10$^{-27}$ kg $\cdot$ m$^{-3}$,
strikingly close to the observed value of $\Omega_{\Lambda} \rho_{c}$.

set of all solutions in reduced words forms an EDT0L language. In particular,
it is an indexed language in the sense of Aho. The question of whether a
description of solution sets in reduced words as an indexed language is
possible has been been open for some years, apparently without much hope that a
positive answer could hold. Nevertheless, our answer goes far beyond: they are
EDT0L, which is a proper subclass of indexed languages. We can additionally
handle the existential theory of equations with rational constraints in free
products $\star_{1 \leq i \leq s}F_i$, where each $F_i$ is either a free or
finite group, or a free monoid with involution. In all cases the result is the
same: the set of all solutions in reduced words is EDT0L. This was known only
for quadratic word equations by Fert\'e, Marin and S\'enizergues (ToCS 2014),
which is a very restricted case. Our general result became possible due to the
recent recompression technique of Je\.z. In this paper we use a new method to
integrate solutions of linear Diophantine equations into the process and obtain
more general results than in the related paper (arXiv 1405.5133). For example,
we improve the complexity from quadratic nondeterministic space in (arXiv
1405.5133) to quasi-linear nondeterministic space here. This implies an
improved complexity for deciding the existential theory of non-abelian free
groups: NSPACE($n\log n$). The conjectured complexity is NP, however, we
believe that our results are optimal with respect to space complexity,
independent of the conjectured NP.

generally align with their filaments this introduces a bias in the measurement

understand why this difference arises. We explore the stability of different
disc orientations within triaxial halos. We show that, in the absence of gas,
the disc orientation is most stable when its spin is along the minor axis of
the halo. Instead when gas cools onto a disc it is able to form in almost
arbitrary orientation, including off the main planes of the halo (but avoiding
an orientation perpendicular to the halo's intermediate axis). Substructure
helps gasless galaxies reach alignment with the halo faster, but have less
effect on galaxies when gas is cooling onto the disc. Our results provide a
novel and natural interpretation for why red, gas poor galaxies are
preferentially aligned with their halo, while blue, star-forming, galaxies have
nearly random orientations, without requiring a connection between galaxies'
current star formation rate and their merger history.

with a temporal component. But do all extensive-form games correspond to
protocols that we can implement in the real world? We often rule out games with
imperfect recall, which prescribe that an agent forget something that she knew
before. In this paper, we show that even some games with perfect recall can be
problematic to implement. Specifically, we show that if the agents have a sense
of time passing (say, access to a clock), then some extensive-form games can no
longer be implemented; no matter how we attempt to time the game, some
information will leak to the agents that they are not supposed to have. We say
such a game is not exactly timeable. We provide easy-to-check necessary and
sufficient conditions for a game to be exactly timeable. Most of the technical
depth of the paper concerns how to approximately time games, which we show can
always be done, though it may require large amounts of time. Specifically, we
show that for some games the time required to approximately implement the game
grows as a power tower of height proportional to the number of players and with
a parameter that measures the precision of the approximation at the top of the
power tower. In practice, that makes the games untimeable. Besides the
conceptual contribution to game theory, we believe our methodology can have
applications to preventing information leakage in security protocols.

for two dimensional topological phases, it is relatively easy to describe only
single fluxon excitations, but not the charge and dyonic as well as many-fluxon
excitations. To incorporate charged and dyonic excitations in (doubled)
topological phases, an extension of the LW models is proposed in this paper. We
first enlarge the Hilbert space with adding a tail on one of the edges of each
trivalent vertex, to describe the internal charge degrees of freedom at the
vertex. Then we study the full dyon spectrum of the extended LW models,
including both quantum numbers and wave functions for dyonic quasiparticle
excitations. The local operators associated with the dyonic excitations are
shown to form the so-called tube algebra, whose representations (modules) form
the quantum double (categoric center) of the input data (unitary fusion
category). In physically relevant cases, the input data is from a finite or
quantum group (with braiding $R$-matrices), we find that the elementary
excitations (or dyon species), as well as any localized/isolated excited
states, are characterized by three quantum numbers: charge, fluxon type, and
twist. They provide a ""complete basis"" for many-body states in the enlarged
Hilbert space. Concrete examples are presented and the relevance of our results

source, likely a high mass X-ray binary (HMXB), with a luminosity of
1.3-23x10^38 erg s^-1 in the 0.3-8 keV energy range. A new Suzaku observation
shows a transition to a luminosity of 1.7x10^40 erg s^-1 [0.3-8 keV], higher by
a factor of 7-130. The spectra from the high flux state are hard, best
described by a disk plus Comptonization model, and exhibit curvature at
energies above 5 keV. This is consistent with many high-quality ultraluminous
X-ray source spectra which have been interpreted as stellar mass black holes
(StMBH) accreting at super-Eddington rates. However, this lies in contrast to
another HMXB in a low-metallicity BCD, I Zw 18, that exhibits a soft spectrum
at high flux, similar to Galactic black hole binaries and has been interpreted
as a possible intermediate mass black hole. Determining the spectral properties
of HMXBs in BCDs has important implications for models of the Epoch of
Reionization. It is thought that the main component of X-ray heating in the
early universe was dominated by HMXBs within the first galaxies. Early galaxies
were small, metal-deficient, star forming galaxies with large H I mass
fractions --- properties shared by local BCDs we see today. Understanding the
spectral evolution of HMXBs in early universe analogue galaxies, such as BCDs,
is an important step in estimating their contribution to the heating of the
intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization. The strong contrast
between the properties of the only two spectroscopically studied HMXBs within
BCDs motivates further study on larger samples of HMXBs in low metallicity
environments in order to properly estimate the X-ray heating in the early
universe.

we address a significant shortcoming of a Bondi-Hoyle-like prescription
commonly invoked to estimate black hole accretion in cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations of galaxy formation, namely that the Bondi-Hoyle radius is
frequently unresolved. We describe and implement a novel super-Lagrangian
refinement scheme to increase, adaptively and 'on the fly', the mass and
spatial resolution in targeted regions around the accreting black holes at
limited computational cost. While our refinement scheme is generically
applicable and flexible, for the purpose of this paper we select the smallest
resolvable scales to match black holes' instantaneous Bondi radii, thus
effectively resolving Bondi-Hoyle-like accretion in full galaxy formation
simulations. This permits us to not only estimate gas properties close to the
Bondi radius much more accurately, but also allows us to improve black hole
accretion and feedback implementations. We thus devise a more generic feedback
model where accretion and feedback depend on the geometry of the local gas
distribution and where mass, energy and momentum loading are followed
simultaneously. We present a series of tests of our refinement and feedback
methods and apply them to models of isolated disc galaxies. Our simulations
demonstrate that resolving gas properties in the vicinity of black holes is
necessary to follow black hole accretion and feedback with a higher level of
realism and that doing so allows us to incorporate important physical processes

In particular, spectral line strengths, based on gravity-sensitive features,
suggest an excess of low-mass stars in massive ETGs, i.e. a bottom-heavy IMF.
The physical drivers of IMF variations are currently unknown. The abundance
ratio of alpha elements, such as [Mg/Fe], has been suggested as a possible
driver of the IMF changes, although dynamical constraints do not support this
claim. In this letter, we take advantage of the large SDSS database. Our sample
comprises 24,781 high-quality spectra, covering a large range in velocity
dispersion (100<sigma0<320 km/s) and abundance ratio (-0.1<[Mg/Fe]<+0.4). The
large volume of data allows us to stack the spectra at fixed values of sigma0
and [Mg/Fe]. Our analysis -- based on gravity-sensitive line strengths -- gives
a strong correlation with central velocity dispersion and a negligible
variation with [Mg/Fe] at fixed sigma0. This result is robust against
individual elemental abundance variations, and seems not to raise any apparent
inconsistency with the alternative method based on galaxy dynamics.

show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket
brigade quantum memory has to be of order $o(2^{-n/2})$ (where $N=2^n$ is the
size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum
searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error
model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with
super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be
super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error
correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] or quantum machine learning [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113,
130503 (2014)] that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate
only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be
required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade
architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the
quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small
number of ""active"" gates, since all components have to be actively error
corrected.

dwarfs (WDs) have been extensively studied over the last few decades, mostly
focusing on the single degenerate (accretion of material of a WD) and double
degenerate (WD-WD merger) scenarios. In recent years it was suggested that
WD-WD direct collisions provide an additional channel for such explosions. Here
we extend the studies of such explosions, and explore the role of Helium-shells
in affecting the thermonuclear explosions. We study both the impact of low-mass
helium ($\sim0.01$ M$_{\odot})$ shells, as well as high mass shells ($\ge0.1$
M$_{\odot}$). We find that detonation of the massive helium layers precede the
detonation of the WD Carbon-Oxygen (CO) bulk during the collision and can
change the explosive evolution and outcomes for the cases of high mass
He-shells. In particular, the He-shell detonation propagates on the WD surface
and inefficiently burns material prior to the CO detonation that later follows
in the central parts of the WD. Such evolution leads to larger production of
intermediate elements, producing large yields of $^{44}{\rm Ti}$ and $^{48}{\rm
Cr}$ relative to the pure CO-CO WD collisions. Collisions of WDs with a
low-mass He-shell do not give rise to helium detonation, but helium burning
does precede the CO bulk detonation. Such collisions produce a high velocity,
low-mass of ejected burned material enriched with intermediate elements, with
smaller changes to the overall explosion outcomes. The various effects arising
from the contribution of low/high mass He layers change the kinematics and the
morphological structure of collision-induced SNe and may thereby provide unique
observational signatures for such SNe, and play a role in the chemical
enrichment of galaxies and the production of intermediate elements and
positrons from their longer-term decay.

configurations. For real fields, these solutions oscillate in time and are
known as oscillatons. The density profile is static, and is soliton. Such
solitons should be ubiquitous in models of axion dark matter, with the soliton
characteristic mass and size depending on some inverse power of the axion mass.
Stable configurations of non-relativistic axions are studied numerically using
the Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson system. This method, and the resulting soliton
density profiles, are reviewed. Using a scaling symmetry and the uncertainty
principle, the core size of the soliton can be related to the central density
and axion mass, $m_a$, in a universal way. Solitons have a constant central
density due to pressure-support, unlike the cuspy profile of cold dark matter
(CDM). One consequence of this fact is that solitons composed of ultra-light
axions (ULAs) may resolve the `cusp-core' problem of CDM. In DM halos,
thermodynamics will lead to a CDM-like Navarro-Frenk-White profile at large
radii, with a central soliton core at small radii. Using Monte-Carlo techniques
to explore the possible density profiles of this form, a fit to
stellar-kinematical data of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is performed. In order
for ULAs to resolve the cusp-core problem (without recourse to baryon feedback
or other astrophysical effects) the axion mass must satisfy $m_a<1.1\times
10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ at 95\% C.L. On the other hand, ULAs with $m_a\lesssim
1\times 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ are in some tension with cosmological structure
formation. An axion solution to the cusp-core problem thus makes novel
predictions for future measurements of the epoch of reionisation. On the other
hand, this can be seen as evidence that structure formation could soon impose a
\emph{Catch 22} on axion/scalar field DM, similar to the case of warm DM.

both the height field of the surface using moir\'e-imaging, and the density
field of the surfactant via the fluorescence of NBD-tagged phosphatidylcholine,

the most important metrics for evaluating the performance of a channel hopping
(CH) rendezvous protocol, and it characterizes the rendezvous delay when two
CRs perform channel hopping. There exists a trade-off of optimizing the average
or maximum TTR in the CH rendezvous protocol design. On one hand, the random CH
protocol leads to the best ""average"" TTR without ensuring a finite ""maximum""
TTR (two CRs may never rendezvous in the worst case), or a high rendezvous
diversity (multiple rendezvous channels). On the other hand, many
sequence-based CH protocols ensure a finite maximum TTR (upper bound of TTR)
and a high rendezvous diversity, while they inevitably yield a larger average
TTR. In this paper, we strike a balance in the average-maximum TTR trade-off
for CR rendezvous by leveraging the advantages of both random and
sequence-based CH protocols. Inspired by the neighbor discovery problem, we
establish a design framework of creating a wake-up schedule whereby every CR
follows the sequence-based (or random) CH protocol in the awake (or asleep)
mode. Analytical and simulation results show that the hybrid CH protocols under
this framework are able to achieve a greatly improved average TTR as well as a
low upper-bound of TTR, without sacrificing the rendezvous diversity.

extend the standard treatment to include a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) potential
and use a maximum likelihood method to recover the parameters describing the
simulated halos from the positions and velocities of their mock halo stars. We
find that the estimate of halo mass is highly correlated with the estimate of
halo concentration. The best-fit halo masses within the virial radius,
$R_{200}$, are biased, ranging from a 40\% underestimate to a 5\% overestimate
in the best case (when the tangential velocities of the tracers are included).
There are several sources of bias. Deviations from dynamical equilibrium can
potentially cause significant bias; deviations from spherical symmetry are
relatively less important. Fits to stars at different galactocentric radii can
give different mass estimates. By contrast, the model gives good constraints on
the mass within the half-mass radius of tracers even when restricted to tracers
within 60kpc. The recovered velocity anisotropies of tracers, $\beta$, are
biased systematically, but this does not affect other parameters if tangential
velocity data are used as constraints.

temperature above room temperature and an anisotropic spontaneous magnetization
preferring an out-of-plane (c-axis) orientation. At magnetic fields up to 50

out-of-plane, which is indicative of exchange coupled spins locked along the

region where the source activity is located and address the related problem of
defining the relevant variables in a coarser scale representation of the

prior at the next finer scale stage of the problem. We present results which
suggest, on simulated data, that this way of including prior information is a
useful aid for the source location problem. This is judged by the rate and

achieved. We also present results on public data collected during a face

disordered quantum wells is activated by dipole-dipole repulsion. The latter
induces an emission blue shift that increases linearly with exciton density,
whereas the radiative recombination rate increases exponentially. Under
continuous, localized excitation, we measure a continuous red shift of the
emission, as excitons propagate away from the excitation spot. This shift
corresponds to a steady-state gradient of exciton density, measured over
several tens of micrometers. Time-resolved micro-photoluminescence experiments
provide information on the dynamics of recombination and transport of dipolar
excitons. We account for the ensemble of experimental results by solving the
nonlinear drift-diffusion equation. Quantitative analysis suggests that in such
structures, exciton propagation on the scale of 10 to 20 microns is mainly
driven by diffusion, rather than by drift, due to the strong disorder and the
presence of nonradiative defects. Secondary exciton creation, most probably by
the intense higher-energy luminescence, guided along the sample plane, is shown
to contribute to the exciton emission pattern on the scale up to 100 microns.
The exciton propagation length is strongly temperature dependent, the emission
being quenched beyond a critical distance governed by nonradiative
recombination.

elastic waves in a quasi-one-dimensional cavity with one port, formed by a
notch grooved at a certain distance from the free end of a beam. The stationary
patterns are diminished using a passive vibration isolation system at the other
end of the beam. The measurement of the resonances is performed with
non-contact electromagnetic-acoustic transducers outside the cavity. In the
Argand plane, each resonance describes a circle over a base impedance curve
which comes from the electromagnetic components of the equipment. A model,
based on a variation of Poisson's kernel is developed. Excellent agreement
between theory and experiment is obtained.

the ground with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) which allows us to have
chromospheric (Ca II 8542 \AA, Ca II H 3968 \AA, H\alpha, and Mg II k 2796

single-wavelength Stokes maps in Fe I 6302 \AA at high spatial (0.33""),
temporal and spectral resolution. We conclude that the IRIS slit-jaw grains are
the counterpart of so-called acoustic grains, i.e., resulting from
chromospheric acoustic waves in a non-magnetic environment. We compare slit-jaw
images with spectra from the IRIS spectrograph. We conclude that the grain
intensity in the 2796 \AA\ slit-jaw filter comes from both the Mg II k core and
wings. The signal in the C II and Si IV lines is too weak to explain the
presence of grains in the 1300 and 1400 \AA\ slit-jaw images and we conclude
that the grain signal in these passbands comes mostly from the continuum. Even
though weak, the characteristic shock signatures of acoustic grains can often
be detected in IRIS C II spectra. For some grains, spectral signature can be
found in IRIS Si IV. This suggests that upward propagating acoustic waves
sometimes reach all the way up to the transition region.

Compute a spectral sparsifier of random-walk matrix-polynomial
$$L_\alpha(G)=D-\sum_{r=1}^d\alpha_rD(D^{-1}A)^r$$ where $A$ is the adjacency
matrix of a weighted, undirected graph, $D$ is the diagonal matrix of weighted
degrees, and $\alpha=(\alpha_1...\alpha_d)$ are nonnegative coefficients with
$\sum_{r=1}^d\alpha_r=1$. Recall that $D^{-1}A$ is the transition matrix of
random walks on the graph. The sparsification of $L_\alpha(G)$ appears to be
algorithmically challenging as the matrix power $(D^{-1}A)^r$ is defined by all
paths of length $r$, whose precise calculation would be prohibitively
expensive.
  In this paper, we develop the first nearly linear time algorithm for this
sparsification problem: For any $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, $d$
coefficients $\alpha$, and $\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm runs in time
$O(d^2m\log^2n/\epsilon^{2})$ to construct a Laplacian matrix
$\tilde{L}=D-\tilde{A}$ with $O(n\log n/\epsilon^{2})$ non-zeros such that
$\tilde{L}\approx_{\epsilon}L_\alpha(G)$.
  Matrix polynomials arise in mathematical analysis of matrix functions as well
as numerical solutions of matrix equations. Our work is particularly motivated
by the algorithmic problems for speeding up the classic Newton's method in
applications such as computing the inverse square-root of the precision matrix
of a Gaussian random field, as well as computing the $q$th-root transition (for
$q\geq1$) in a time-reversible Markov model. The key algorithmic step for both
applications is the construction of a spectral sparsifier of a constant degree
random-walk matrix-polynomials introduced by Newton's method. Our algorithm can
also be used to build efficient data structures for effective resistances for
multi-step time-reversible Markov models, and we anticipate that it could be
useful for other tasks in network analysis.

these modern calculations, the extracted neutrino mass-squared values are
consistent with zero instead of being significantly negative. On the other

dissociation experiments performed in the 1950s. We re-examine the theory of
the final-state spectrum of molecular tritium decay and its effect on the
determination of the neutrino mass, with an emphasis on the role of the

minimum value of total number of transmissions that achieves universal recovery

necessary and sufficient condition for a supermodular base polyhedron to be

high complexity of solving this maximization problem, we propose a
deterministic algorithm to approximate a lower bound on the minimum sum-rate.
We show by experiments that this lower bound is much tighter than those lower

beta-BaZn2As2 (previously-reported value ~0.2 eV) is one order of magnitude
smaller than that of LaZnAsO (1.5 eV). In this paper, the reliable bandgap
value of beta-BaZn2As2 is determined to be 0.23 eV from the intrinsic region of
the tem-perature dependence of electrical conductivity. The origins of this
narrow bandgap are discussed based on the chemi-cal bonding nature probed by 6

calculations, and the ligand theory. One origin is the direct As-As
hybridization between adjacent [ZnAs] layers, which leads to a secondary
splitting of As 4p levels and raises the valence band maximum. The other is
that the non-bonding Ba 5dx2-y2 orbitals form unexpectedly deep conduction band
minimum (CBM) in beta-BaZn2As2 although the CBM of LaZnAsO is formed mainly of
Zn 4s. These two origins provide a quantitative explanation for the bandgap

Seyfert 2s are intrinsically same, but they are viewed at different angles.
However, the Fe K\alpha emission line luminosity of Seyfert 1s was found in
average to be about twice of that of Seyfert 2s at given X-ray continuum
luminosity in the previous work (Ricci et al. 2014). We construct an accretion
disc-corona model, in which a fraction of energy dissipated in the disc is
extracted to heat the corona above the disc. The radiation transfer equation
containing Compton scattering processes is an integro-differential equation,
which is solved numerically for the corona with a parallel plane geometry. We
find that the specific intensity of X-ray radiation from the corona changes
little with the viewing angle \theta when \theta is small (nearly face-on), and
it is sensitive to \theta if the viewing angle is large (\theta> 40 degrees).
The radiation from the cold disc, mostly in infrared/optical/UV bands, is
almost proportional to cos\theta when \theta< 40 degrees, while it decreases
more rapidly than cos\theta when \theta> 40 degrees because of strong
absorption in the corona in this case. For seyfert galaxies, the Fe K\alpha
line may probably be emitted from the disc irradiated by the X-ray continuum
emission. The observed equivalent width (EW) difference between Seyfert 1s and
Seyfert 2s can be reproduced by our model calculations, provided Seyfert 1s are
observed in nearly face-on direction and the average inclination angle of
Seyfert 2s ~65 dgrees.

only one sample or a mini-batch of samples each time, has recently been proved
to achieve better performance than batch ADMM. However, most stochastic methods
can only achieve a convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt T)$ on general convex
problems,where T is the number of iterations. Hence, these methods are not
scalable with respect to convergence rate (computation cost). There exists only
one stochastic method, called SA-ADMM, which can achieve convergence rate
$O(1/T)$ on general convex problems. However, an extra memory is needed for
SA-ADMM to store the historic gradients on all samples, and thus it is not
scalable with respect to storage cost. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, called scalable stochastic ADMM(SCAS-ADMM), for large-scale
optimization and learning problems. Without the need to store the historic
gradients, SCAS-ADMM can achieve the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ as the best
stochastic method SA-ADMM and batch ADMM on general convex problems.

reduce the probability of producing these backgrounds. We study three
generations of cathode (wire, thin-film, and radiologically clean thin-film)
with a focus on the ratio of background events to alpha decays. Two independent
methods of measuring the absolute alpha decay rate are used to ensure an

neuroimaging studies. In order to correct for this phenomena, we require a
reliable estimate of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). The well known
Bonferroni correction method, while simple to implement, is quite conservative,
and can substantially under-power a study because it ignores dependencies
between test statistics. Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact,
non-parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given $\alpha$-threshold,
but for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive.
In this paper, we show that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating
the columns of a very large matrix ${\bf P}$. By analyzing the spectrum of this
matrix, under certain conditions, we see that ${\bf P}$ has a low-rank plus a
low-variance residual decomposition which makes it suitable for highly
sub--sampled --- on the order of $0.5\%$ --- matrix completion methods. Based
on this observation, we propose a novel permutation testing methodology which
offers a large speedup, without sacrificing the fidelity of the estimated FWER.
Our evaluations on four different neuroimaging datasets show that a
computational speedup factor of roughly $50\times$ can be achieved while
recovering the FWER distribution up to very high accuracy. Further, we show
that the estimated $\alpha$-threshold is also recovered faithfully, and is
stable.

localized quantum objects with one party or both accelerated in vacuum would be
degraded due to the heat-up by the Unruh effect. In this paper we point out
that the Unruh effect is not the whole story in accounting for all the
relativistic effects in quantum teleportation. First, there could be
degradation of fidelity by a common field environment even when both quantum
objects are in inertial motion. Second, relativistic effects entering the
description of the dynamics such as frame dependence, time dilation, and
Doppler shift, already existent in inertial motion, can compete with or even
overwhelm the effect due to uniform acceleration in a quantum field. We show it
is not true that larger acceleration of an object would necessarily lead to a
faster degradation of fidelity. These claims are based on four cases of quantum
teleportation we studied using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled via a common
quantum field initially in the Minkowski vacuum. We find the quantum
entanglement evaluated around the light cone, rather than the conventional ones
evaluated on the Minkowski time-slices, is the necessary condition for the
averaged fidelity of quantum teleportation beating the classical one. These
results are useful as a guide to making judicious choices of states and
parameter ranges and estimation of the efficiency of quantum teleportation in
relativistic quantum systems under environmental influences.

range of sensing applications with great success. This has been motivated by
several advantages such as high sensitivity, miniaturization, remote sensing,
selectivity and stability. Many photonic crystal sensors have been proposed
with various fabrication designs that result in improved optical properties. In
parallel, integrated optical systems are being pursued as a platform for
photonic quantum information processing using linear optics and Fock states.
Here we propose a novel integrated Fock state optical sensor architecture that
can be used for force, refractive index and possibly local temperature
detection. In this scheme, two coupled cavities behave as an ""effective beam
splitter"". The sensor works based on fourth order interference (the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect) and requires a sequence of single photon pulses and
consequently has low pulse power. Changes in the parameter to be measured
induce variations in the effective beam splitter reflectivity and result in
changes to the visibility of interference. We demonstrate this generic scheme
in coupled L3 photonic crystal cavities as an example and find that this
system, which only relies on photon coincidence detection and does not need any
spectral resolution, can estimate forces as small as $10^{-7}$ Newtons and can
measure one part per million change in refractive index using a very low input
power of $10^{-10}$W. Thus linear optical quantum photonic architectures can
achieve comparable sensor performance to semiclassical devices.

numerous, recursively defined centers for things or spaces surrounding us.
Wholeness is a type of global structure or life-giving order emerging from the
whole as a field of the centers. The wholeness is an essential part of any
complex system and exists, to some degree or other, in spaces. This paper
defines wholeness as a hierarchical graph, in which individual centers are
represented as the nodes and their relationships as the directed links. The
hierarchical graph gets its name from the inherent scaling hierarchy revealed
by the head/tail breaks, which is a classification scheme and visualization
tool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution. We suggest that (1) the degrees
of wholeness for individual centers should be measured by PageRank (PR) scores
based on the notion that high-degree-of-life centers are those to which many
high-degree-of-life centers point, and (2) that the hierarchical levels, or the
ht-index of the PR scores induced by the head/tail breaks can characterize the
degree of wholeness for the whole: the higher the ht-index, the more life or
wholeness in the whole. Three case studies applied to the Alhambra building
complex and the street networks of Manhattan and Sweden illustrate that the
defined wholeness captures fairly well human intuitions on the degree of life
for the geographic spaces. We further suggest that the mathematical model of
wholeness be an important model of geographic representation, because it is
topological oriented that enables us to see the underlying scaling structure.
The model can guide geodesign, which should be considered as the
wholeness-extending transformations that are essentially like the unfolding
processes of seeds or embryos, for creating beautiful built and natural
environments or with a high degree of wholeness.

intensifies the need of an automatic instance matching technique. However, the
efficiency of instance matching is often influenced by the weight of a property
associated to instances. Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial, however
an important task in instance matching technique. Therefore, identifying an
appropriate metric for generating weight for a property automatically is
nevertheless a formidable task. In this paper, we investigate an approach of
generating weights automatically by considering hypotheses: (1) the weight of a
property is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its distinct
values to the number of instances contain the property, and (2) the weight is
also proportional to the ratio of the number of distinct values of a property
to the number of instances in a training dataset. The basic intuition behind
the use of our approach is the classical theory of information content that
infrequent words are more informative than frequent ones. Our mathematical
model derives a metric for generating property weights automatically, which is
applied in instance matching system to produce re-conciliated instances
efficiently. Our experiments and evaluations show the effectiveness of our
proposed metric of automatic weight generation for properties in an instance

positive equal weight quadrature rule having algebraic accuracy $t$ for all

distinguished properties in approximations on the sphere and receive remarkable
attention. Although the existence of a spherical $t$-design is known for any
$t\ge 0$, a spherical design is only known in a set of interval enclosures on
the sphere \cite{chen2011computational} for $t\le 100$. It is unknown how to
choose a set of points from the set of interval enclosures to obtain a
spherical $t$-design. In this paper we investigate a new concept of point sets
on the sphere named spherical $t_\epsilon$-design ($0<\epsilon<1$), which are
nodes of a positive weight quadrature rule with algebraic accuracy $t$. The sum
of the weights is equal to the area of the sphere and the mean value of the
weights is equal to the weight of the quadrature rule defined by the spherical
$t$-design. A spherical $t_\epsilon$-design is a spherical $t$-design when
$\epsilon=0,$ and a spherical $t$-design is a spherical $t_\epsilon$-design for
any $0<\epsilon <1$. We show that any point set chosen from the set of interval
enclosures \cite{chen2011computational} is a spherical $t_\epsilon$-design. We
then study the worst-case errors of quadrature rules using spherical
$t_\epsilon$-designs in a Sobolev space, and investigate a model of polynomial
approximation with the $l_1$-regularization using spherical
$t_\epsilon$-designs. Numerical results illustrate good performance of
spherical $t_\epsilon$-designs for numerical integration and function

those of randomly-distributed points with the same number density and sky

of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a protein belonging to the transmembrane protein
family. To take into account the structure-dependent nature of the current, in
a previous set of papers we suggested a mechanism of sequential tunneling among
neighbouring amino acids. As a matter of fact, it is well accepted that, when
irradiated with green light, bR undergoes a conformational change at a
molecular level. Thus, the role played by the protein tertiary-structure in
modeling the charge transfer cannot be neglected. The aim of this paper is to
go beyond previous models, in the framework of a new branch of electronics, we
called proteotronics, which exploits the ability to use proteins as reliable,
well understood materials, for the development of novel bioelectronic devices.
In particular, the present approach assumes that the conformational change is
not the unique transformation that the protein undergoes when irradiated by
light. Instead, the light can also promote a free-energy increase of the
protein state that, in turn, should modify its internal degree of connectivity,
here described by the change in the value of an interaction radius associated
with the physical interactions among amino acids. The implemented model enables
us to achieve a better agreement between theory and experiments in the region
of a low applied bias by preserving the level of agreement at high values of
applied bias. Furthermore, results provide new insights on the mechanisms
responsible for bR photoresponse.

  Proceedings of ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, Arlington, VA, 2016",,,,"math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods and randomized
linear algebra (RLA) algorithms have been applied to many large-scale problems
in machine learning and data analysis. We aim to bridge the gap between these
two methods in solving constrained overdetermined linear regression
problems---e.g., $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ regression problems. We propose a hybrid
algorithm named pwSGD that uses RLA techniques for preconditioning and
constructing an importance sampling distribution, and then performs an SGD-like
iterative process with weighted sampling on the preconditioned system. We prove
that pwSGD inherits faster convergence rates that only depend on the lower
dimension of the linear system, while maintaining low computation complexity.
Particularly, when solving $\ell_1$ regression with size $n$ by $d$, pwSGD
returns an approximate solution with $\epsilon$ relative error in the objective
value in $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \text{nnz}(A) + \text{poly}(d)/\epsilon^2)$
time. This complexity is uniformly better than that of RLA methods in terms of
both $\epsilon$ and $d$ when the problem is unconstrained. For $\ell_2$
regression, pwSGD returns an approximate solution with $\epsilon$ relative
error in the objective value and the solution vector measured in prediction
norm in $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \text{nnz}(A) + \text{poly}(d)
\log(1/\epsilon) /\epsilon)$ time. We also provide lower bounds on the coreset
complexity for more general regression problems, indicating that still new
ideas will be needed to extend similar RLA preconditioning ideas to weighted
SGD algorithms for more general regression problems. Finally, the effectiveness
of such algorithms is illustrated numerically on both synthetic and real
datasets.

material parameters might include false local attractors or even divergence.
Also, inappropriate choices of covariance errors of initial state, present
state, and measurements might affect the stability of the prediction. The
present method suggests a simple way to predict the parameters and the errors,
required to start Kalman filter based on known parameters that are used to
generate the data with different noises used as 'measurement data'. The method
consists of two steps. First, an appropriate range of parameter values is
chosen based on a graphical representation of the mean square error. Second,
the Kalman filter is used based on the selected range and the suggested
parameters and errors. The method of the filter significantly reduces the
iteration time, and covers a wide range of initial suggested values for the
parameters compared with the standard Kalman filter. When the methodology is
applied to real data, very good results are obtained. Diffusion coefficient for
bovine bone is chosen to be a case study in this work.

amorphous H$_2$O:D$_2$O ices by monitoring the change in intensity of
characteristic vibrational bending modes of H$_2$O, HDO, and D$_2$O with time
and as function of temperature. The experiments have been performed using an
ultra-high vacuum setup equipped with an infrared spectrometer that is used to
investigate the spectral evolution of homogeneously mixed ice upon
co-deposition in thin films, for temperatures in the 90 to 140 K domain. With
this non-energetic detection method we find a significantly lower activation
energy for H/D exchange -- $3840 \pm 125$ K -- than previously reported. Very
likely this is due to the amorphous nature of the interstellar ice analogues
involved. This provides reactive timescales ($\tau<10^4$ years at $T$ $>70$ K)
fast enough for the process to be important in interstellar environments.
Consequently, an astronomical detection of D$_2$O will be even more challenging
because of its potential to react with H$_2$O to form HDO. Furthermore,
additional experiments, along with previous studies, show that proton/deuteron
swapping also occurs in ice mixtures of water with other hydrogen bonded
molecules, in particular on the OH and NH moieties. We conclude that H/D
exchange in ices is a more general process that should be incorporated into ice
models that are applied to protoplanetary disks or to simulate the warming up
of cometary ices in their passage of the perihelion, to examine the extent of
its influence on the final deuteron over hydrogen ratio.

measurement-based control, but so far there has been little work done on
coherent estimators and more specifically coherent observers. Coherent
observers are input the coherent output of a specified quantum plant, and are
designed such that some subset of the observer and plant's expectation values
converge in the asymptotic limit. We previously developed a class of mean
tracking (MT) observers for open harmonic oscillators that only converged in
mean position and momentum; Here we develop a class of covariance matrix
tracking (CMT) coherent observers that track both the mean and covariance
matrix of a quantum plant. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
the existence of a CMT observer, and find there are more restrictions on a CMT
observer than there are on a MT observer. We give examples where we demonstrate
how to design a CMT observer and show it can be used to track properties like
the entanglement of a plant. As the CMT observer provides more quantum
information than a MT observer, we expect it will have greater application in
future coherent feedback schemes mediated by coherent observers. Investigation
of coherent quantum estimators and observers is important in the ongoing
discussion of quantum measurement; As they provide estimation of a system's
quantum state without explicit use of the measurement postulate in their
derivation.

between two porous cylinders with respect to three-dimensional perturbations.
The basic flow is irrotational, and both radial and azimuthal components of the
velocity are non-zero. The direction of the radial flow can be from the inner
cylinder to the outer one (the diverging flow) or from the outer cylinder to
the inner one (the converging flow). It had been shown earlier in Ref.
\cite{IM2013a} that, independent of the direction of the radial flow, the basic
flow can be unstable to small two-dimensional perturbations. In the present
paper, we prove first that purely radial flow is stable and that flows with
both radial and azimuthal components are always stable to axisymmetric
perturbations. Then we show that both the diverging and converging flows are
unstable with respect to non-axisymmetric three-dimensional perturbations
provided that the ratio of the azimuthal component of the velocity to the
radial one is sufficiently large. Neutral curves in the space of parameters of
the problem are computed and it is demonstrated that for any ratio of the radii
of the cylinders, the most unstable modes (corresponding to the smallest ratio
of the azimuthal velocity to the radial one) are the two-dimensional ones. We
also consider the corresponding viscous stability problem and construct an
asymptotic expansion of its solutions for large radial Reynolds numbers. We
compute the first-order viscous correction to inviscid eigenvalues and show
that the asymptotic results give a good approximation to the viscous
eigenvalues even for moderate values of radial Reynolds number, which indicates
that the instability may be observed in real flows.

composition of the mantle and core size. Specifically, we identify what parts
of the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets can be determined from
observations of mass, radius, and stellar elemental abundances. We perform a
full probabilistic inverse analysis to formally account for observational and
model uncertainties and obtain confidence regions of interior structure models.
This enables us to characterize how model variability depends on data and
associated uncertainties. We test our method on terrestrial solar system
planets and find that our model predictions are consistent with independent
estimates. Furthermore, we apply our method to synthetic exoplanets up to 10
Earth masses and up to 1.7 Earth radii as well as to exoplanet Kepler-36b.
Importantly, the inversion strategy proposed here provides a framework for
understanding the level of precision required to characterize the interior of
exoplanets. Our main conclusions are: (1) observations of mass and radius are
sufficient to constrain core size; (2) stellar elemental abundances (Fe, Si,
Mg) are key constraints to reduce degeneracy in interior structure models and
to constrain mantle composition; (3) the inherent degeneracy in determining
interior structure from mass and radius observations does not only depend on
measurement accuracies but also on the actual size and density of the
exoplanet. We argue that precise observations of stellar elemental abundances
are central in order to place constraints on planetary bulk composition and to
reduce model degeneracy. [...]

Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the high-density
molecular cloud core, MC27/L1521F. We performed self-gravitational
hydrodynamical numerical simulations with an adaptive mesh refinement code. A
filamentary cloud with a 0.1~pc width fragments into cloud cores because of
perturbations due to weak turbulence. The cloud core undergoes gravitational
collapse to form multiple protostars, and gravitational torque from the
orbiting protostars produces arc structures extending up to a 1000~AU scale. As
well as on a spatial extent, the velocity ranges of the arc structures,
$\sim0.5\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$, are in agreement with the ALMA observations. We
also found that circumstellar disks are often misaligned in triple system. The
misalignment is caused by the tidal interaction between the protostars when
they undergo close encounters because of a highly eccentric orbit of the tight
binary pair.

mathematics with the aim of finding the minimal axioms required for proving
theorems about countable and separable objects. RM usually takes place in
second-order arithmetic and due to this choice of framework, continuous
real-valued functions have to be represented by so-called codes. Kohlenbach has
shown that the RM-definition of continuity-via-codes constitutes a slight
constructive enrichment of the epsilon-delta definition, namely in the form of
a modulus of continuity. In this paper, we show that the RM-definition of
continuity also gives rise to a `nonstandard' enrichment in the form of
nonstandard continuity from Nonstandard Analysis. This observation allows us to
(i) establish that RM-theorems related to continuity are implicitly
higher-order statements, (ii) prove equivalences between RM-theorems concerning
continuity and their associated higher-order versions, and (iii) obtain
explicit equivalences between higher-order theorems from the equivalence
between the corresponding RM-theorems. Moreover, we show that it is exactly the
RM-definition of continuity-via-codes which gives rise to these higher-order
phenomena. In conclusion, we establish that the practice of coding in RM,
designed to obviate higher-type objects, actually introduces a host of new

by which is meant the following: For a property, decidable in finite time and
which is not false for all natural numbers, checking said property starting at
zero, then for one, for two, and so on, one will eventually find a natural
number which satisfies the property, assuming no resource bounds. By contrast,
it seems one cannot search through the real numbers in any similarly `basic'
fashion: The reals numbers are not countable, and their well-orders carry
extreme logical strength compared to the basic notions involved in `searching
through the natural numbers'. In this paper, we study two principles (PB) and
(TB) from Nonstandard Analysis which essentially state that `one can search
through the reals'. These principle are basic in that they involve only
constructive objects of type zero and one, and the associated `search through
the reals' amounts to nothing more than a bounded search involving nonstandard
numbers as upper bound, but independent of the choice of this number. We show
that (PB) and (TB) are equivalent to known systems from Reverse Mathematics,
namely respectively the existence of the hyperjump and
$\Delta_{1}^{1}$-comprehension. We also show that (PB) and (TB) exhibit
remarkable similarity to, respectively,the Turing jump and recursive

treat number quantifiers as `one-dimensional' bounded searches, and set
quantifiers as `two-dimensional' bounded searches.

choice of geometric configurations of all reaction intermediates is crucial for
an adequate description of a possible reaction path. From the point of view of
the catalyst design, the cluster geometry can be controlled by adjusting the
level of interaction between the cluster and the dopant metal, as well as
between the adsorbate molecules and the catalyst cluster by mixing different

biophysics and nanotechnology. In this article we consider the shear-induced
rupture of short DNA duplexes, a system that has been given new importance by
recently designed force sensors and nanotechnological devices. We argue that
rupture must be understood as an activated process, where the duplex state is
metastable and the strands will separate in a finite time that depends on the
duplex length and the force applied. Thus, the critical shearing force required
to rupture a duplex within a given experiment depends strongly on the time
scale of observation. We use simple models of DNA to demonstrate that this
approach naturally captures the experimentally observed dependence of the
critical force on duplex length for a given observation time. In particular,
the critical force is zero for the shortest duplexes, before rising sharply and
then plateauing in the long length limit. The prevailing approach, based on
identifying when the presence of each additional base pair within the duplex is
thermodynamically unfavorable rather than allowing for metastability, does not
predict a time-scale-dependent critical force and does not naturally
incorporate a critical force of zero for the shortest duplexes. Additionally,
motivated by a recently proposed force sensor, we investigate application of
stress to a duplex in a mixed mode that interpolates between shearing and
unzipping. As with pure shearing, the critical force depends on the time scale
of observation; at a fixed time scale and duplex length, the critical force
exhibits a sigmoidal dependence on the fraction of the duplex that is subject
to shearing.

at very small scales compared to the scales at which energy is presumed to be

chemistry, thus providing observable features. Here, we perform 3D spectral
simulations of decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence including the effects of
AD. We find that the AD heating power spectrum peaks at scales in the inertial
range, due to a strong alignment of the magnetic and current vectors in the
dissipative range. AD affects much greater scales than the AD scale predicted
by dimensional analysis. We find that energy dissipation is highly concentrated
on thin sheets. Its probability density function follows a lognormal law with a
power-law tail which hints at intermittency, a property which we quantify by
use of structure function exponents. Finally, we extract structures of high

scales that are intermediate between those accessed by coronagraphic imaging
and long baseline interferometry. This intermediate region is of special
interest given that many young stellar objects are believed to harbor extended
halos at such angular scales. Using destructive interference (nulling) between
two sub-apertures of the Palomar 200 inch telescope and rotating the telescope
pupil, we measured a resolved circumstellar excess at all probed azimuth
angles. The astrophysical null measured over the full rotation is fairly
constant, with a mean value of 1.52%, and a slight additional azimuthal
modulation of +/-0.2%. The isotropic astrophysical null is indicative of
circumstellar emission dominated by an azimuthally extended source, possibly a
halo, or one or more rings of dust, accounting for several percent of the total
Ks-band flux. The modest azimuthal variation may be explained by some skewness
or anisotropy of the spatially extended source, e.g., an elliptical or spiral
geometry, or clumping, but it could also be due to the presence of a point
source located at a separation of ~120 mas (17AU) with ~6*10-3 of the stellar
flux. We combine our results with previous Infrared Optical Telescope Array

In
most previous work, the ""bag-of-words"" assumption is usually made which ignores
the ordering of words. This assumption simplifies the computation, but it
unrealistically loses the ordering information and the semantic of words in the
context. In this paper, we present a Gaussian Mixture Neural Topic Model
(GMNTM) which incorporates both the ordering of words and the semantic meaning
of sentences into topic modeling. Specifically, we represent each topic as a
cluster of multi-dimensional vectors and embed the corpus into a collection of
vectors generated by the Gaussian mixture model. Each word is affected not only
by its topic, but also by the embedding vector of its surrounding words and the
context. The Gaussian mixture components and the topic of documents, sentences
and words can be learnt jointly. Extensive experiments show that our model can
learn better topics and more accurate word distributions for each topic.
Quantitatively, comparing to state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches, GMNTM
obtains significantly better performance in terms of perplexity, retrieval

a significant correlation between the peak power of the episodic jet and the

tool for extracting non-perturbative and non-equilibrium physics from quantum
field theories. Unfortunately, practical truncations of $n$PIEA can
unphysically violate symmetries. Pilaftsis and Teresi (PT) addressed this by
introducing a ""symmetry improvement"" scheme in the context of the 2PIEA for an
O(2) scalar theory, ensuring that the Goldstone boson is massless in the broken
symmetry phase [A. Pilaftsis and D. Teresi, Nuc.Phys. B 874, 2 (2013), pp.
594--619]. We extend this by introducing a symmetry improved 3PIEA for O(N)
theories, for which the basic variables are the 1-, 2- and 3-point correlation
functions. This requires the imposition of a Ward identity involving the
3-point function. The method leads to an infinity of physically distinct
schemes, though an analogue of d'Alembert's principle is used to single out a
unique scheme. The standard equivalence hierarchy of $n$PIEA no longer holds
with symmetry improvement and we investigate the difference between the
symmetry improved 3PIEA and 2PIEA. We present renormalized equations of motion
and counter-terms for 2 and 3 loop truncations of the effective action, leaving
their numerical solution to future work. We solve the Hartree-Fock
approximation and find that our method achieves a middle ground between the
unimproved 2PIEA and PT methods. The phase transition predicted by our method
is weakly first order and the Goldstone theorem is satisfied. We also show
that, in contrast to PT, the symmetry improved 3PIEA at 2 loops does not
predict the correct Higgs decay rate, but does at 3 loops. These results
suggest that symmetry improvement should not be applied to $n$PIEA truncated to
$<n$ loops. We also show that symmetry improvement is compatible with the
Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, a check on the consistency of the formalism.

radiation that adds and interferes with all the other internal fields

contributing to build up the total internal field within the dielectric

computing the velocity and the threshold associated with such motion. In the

the chemical information included in the peak shapes and peak positions of
spectra measured by AES depth profiling. Due to its ability to extract the
number of independent chemical components, their spectra and their depth
distributions, its information content exceeds the one of the usual
peak-to-peak height evaluation of AES depth profile data. Using modern software
with a graphically interactive user interface the analyst is put into a
position, where he can work with Factor Analysis on a physically intuitive
level despite of all the matrix algebra mathematics which it is based upon. The
progress brought about by Factor Analysis to AES depth profiles of thin films
is demonstrated by the analysis of two thin film systems. The first one is a
Pt/Ti metallisation used as bottom electrode for ferroelectric thin films, the
second one is multilayer system where a Ti silicide formation of burried Ti/Si
bilayers has been induced. Both examples show that Factor Analysis evaluation
of AES depth profile data is capable to give access to stoichiometry
information and to reveal interfacial layer phases, information which is hardly
obtained from the conventional peak-to-peak height data evaluation.

is critical to many cooperation schemes such as Network MIMO, Interference
Alignment etc. Practical CSI feedback and limited backhaul-based sharing
inevitably creates degradations of CSI which are specific to each TX, giving
rise to a distributed form of CSI. In the Distributed CSI (D-CSI) broadcast
channel setting, the various TXs design elements of the precoder based on their
individual estimates of the global multiuser channel matrix, which intuitively
degrades performance when compared with the commonly used centralized CSI
assumption. This paper tackles this challenging scenario and presents a first
analysis of the rate performance for the distributed CSI multi-TX broadcast
channel setting, in the large number of antenna regime. Using Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) tools, we derive deterministic equivalents of the Signal to
Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) for the popular regularized Zero-Forcing
(ZF) precoder, allowing to unveil the price of distributedness for such
cooperation methods.

the sputter sample. We further understood the action of O interface states by
comparing our results with Ge QDs grown by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found

Dirac cone structure. In the superconducting case, doping away from the Dirac
point leads to a doubling of the contours of constant energy. This is in
contrast to the unpaired case where the chemical potential simply adds to the
bias voltage and shifts the energy. This doubling of contours results in
multiplying the number of possible scattering processes in each energy.
Interestingly, we find that some processes are dominant in the impurity case
while others are dominant in the vortex case. Moreover, the two types of

distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) in downlink cellular
networks. CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that can assign
different time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy different channel
access ratio (CAR) requirements of users while exploiting multi-user diversity.
We first mathematically analyze the throughput characteristics of CS in
arbitrary fading statistics and data rate functions. It is shown that the
throughput gain of CS increases as the CAR of a user decreases or the number of
users in a cell increases. For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the
average throughput in closed-form and investigate the effects of the average
signal-to-noise ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput
performance. In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback
technique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR
requirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of the
proposed technique is upper bounded by -ln(p), where p is the probability that
no user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell. Finally, we adopt a novel
fairness criterion, called qualitative fairness, which considers not only the
quantity of the allocated resources to users but also the quality of the
resources. It is observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than
other scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users.

that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper,
we present a simple model that is able to generate descriptive sentences given
a sample image. This model has a strong focus on the syntax of the
descriptions. We train a purely bilinear model that learns a metric between an
image representation (generated from a previously trained Convolutional Neural
Network) and phrases that are used to described them. The system is then able
to infer phrases from a given image sample. Based on caption syntax statistics,
we propose a simple language model that can produce relevant descriptions for a
given test image using the phrases inferred. Our approach, which is
considerably simpler than state-of-the-art models, achieves comparable results
in two popular datasets for the task: Flickr30k and the recently proposed
Microsoft COCO.

this cluster. In the case of the Arches cluster, a disc fraction of 9.2 +/-
1.2% approximately out to the cluster's predicted tidal radius, r < 1.5 pc, is
observed. This excess fraction is consistent with our previously found disc
fraction in the cluster in the radial range 0.3 < r < 0.8 pc. In both clusters,
the host star mass range covers late A- to early B-type stars, 2 < M < 15 Msun,

becoming increasingly difficult to keep manually curated knowledge bases and
ontologies up-to-date. In this study we applied the word2vec deep learning
toolkit to medical corpora to test its potential for identifying relationships
from unstructured text. We evaluated the efficiency of word2vec in identifying
properties of pharmaceuticals based on mid-sized, unstructured medical text
corpora available on the web. Properties included relationships to diseases
('may treat') or physiological processes ('has physiological effect'). We
compared the relationships identified by word2vec with manually curated
information from the National Drug File - Reference Terminology (NDF-RT)
ontology as a gold standard. RESULTS: Our results revealed a maximum accuracy
of 49.28% which suggests a limited ability of word2vec to capture linguistic
regularities on the collected medical corpora compared with other published
results. We were able to document the influence of different parameter settings
on result accuracy and found and unexpected trade-off between ranking quality
and accuracy. Pre-processing corpora to reduce syntactic variability proved to
be a good strategy for increasing the utility of the trained vector models.
CONCLUSIONS: Word2vec is a very efficient implementation for computing vector
representations and for its ability to identify relationships in textual data
without any prior domain knowledge. We found that the ranking and retrieved
results generated by word2vec were not of sufficient quality for automatic
population of knowledge bases and ontologies, but could serve as a starting
point for further manual curation.

physics, and time series analysis. We are particularly interested in the
distribution of the smallest non-zero eigenvalue and the gap probability to
find no eigenvalue in an interval $[0,t]$. While for odd topology $\nu=n-p$
explicit closed results are known for finite and infinite matrix size, for even
$\nu>2$ only recursive expressions in $p$ are available.The smallest eigenvalue
distribution as well as the gap probability for general even $\nu$ is
equivalent to expectation values of characteristic polynomials raised to a

skew-orthogonal polynomials and bosonisation methods. The results are given in
terms of Pfaffian determinants both at finite $p$ and in the hard edge scaling
limit ($p\to\infty$ and $\nu$ fixed) for an arbitrary even topology $\nu$.
Numerical simulations for the correlated Wishart ensemble illustrate the
universality of our results in this particular limit. These simulations point
to a validity of the hard edge scaling limit beyond the invariant case.

spheroids are described by means of a physically motivated backward model. The
spectral evolution of spheroids is modelled by means of a single-mass model,
associated to a present-day elliptical with K-band luminosity comparable to the
break of the local early-type luminosity function. The formation of
proto-spheroids is assumed to occurr across the redshift range 1< z < 5. The
key parameter is represented by the redshift z_0.5 at which half
proto-spheroids are already formed. A statistical study indicates for this
parameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3. We assume as fiducial value
z_0.5~2, and show that this assumption allows us to describe accourately the
redshift distributions and the source counts. By assuming z_0.5 ~ 2 at the
far-IR flux limit of the PEP-COSMOS survey, the PEP-selected sources observed
at z>2 can be explained as progenitors of local spheroids caught during their
formation. We also test the effects of mass downsizing by dividing the
spheroids into three populations of different present-day stellar masses. The
results obtained in this case confirm the validity of our approach, i.e. that
the bulk of proto-spheroids can be modelled by means of a single model which

microwave resonator using a single coherent drive tone. We treat the transmon
as a three-level system with the qubit subspace defined by the ground and the
second excited states. If the drive frequency matches the difference between
the resonator and the qubit frequency, a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction is
induced, which is tunable both in amplitude and phase. We show that coupling
strengths of about 10 MHz can be achieved in our setup, limited only by the
anharmonicity of the transmon qubit. This scheme has been successfully used to
generate microwave photons with controlled temporal shape [Pechal et al., Phys.
Rev. X 4, 041010 (2014)] and can be directly implemented with superconducting
quantum devices featuring larger anharmonicity for higher coupling strengths.

they play a fundamental role in the exchange of substances at the cellular
level and in determining the rate of chemical reactions. Recently, the
classical picture that portrays diffusion as random uncorrelated motion of
molecules has been revised, when it was shown that giant non-equilibrium
fluctuations develop during diffusion processes. Under microgravity conditions
and at steady-state, non-equilibrium fluctuations exhibit scale invariance and
their size is only limited by the boundaries of the system. In this work, we
investigate the onset of non-equilibrium concentration fluctuations induced by
thermophoretic diffusion in microgravity, a regime not accessible to analytical
calculations but of great relevance for the understanding of several natural
and technological processes. A combination of state of the art simulations and
experiments allows us to attain a fully quantitative description of the
development of fluctuations during transient diffusion in microgravity. Both
experiments and simulations show that during the onset the fluctuations exhibit
scale invariance at large wave vectors. In a broader range of wave vectors
simulations predict a spinodal-like growth of fluctuations, where the amplitude
and length-scale of the dominant mode are determined by the thickness of the
diffuse layer.

different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise
account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what

partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various

show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a

far these problems have been stated for general (number) rings but have only

heuristically large class of fields. Certain Ring-LWE instances can be
transformed into Poly-LWE instances without distorting the error too much, and
thus provide the first weak instances of the Ring-LWE problem. We also provide

degrees of unsolvability of cohesive sets for different uniformly computable
sequence of sets and identify different layers of unsolvability. This analysis
enables us to answer some questions of Wang about how typical sets help
computing cohesive sets.
  We also study the impact of the number of colors in the computable
reducibility between coloring statements. In particular, we strengthen the
proof by Dzhafarov that cohesiveness does not strongly reduce to stable
Ramsey's theorem for pairs, revealing the combinatorial nature of this
non-reducibility and prove that whenever $k$ is greater than $\ell$, stable
Ramsey's theorem for $n$-tuples and $k$ colors is not computably reducible to
Ramsey's theorem for $n$-tuples and $\ell$ colors. In this sense, Ramsey's
theorem is not robust with respect to his number of colors over computable
reducibility. Finally, we separate the thin set and free set theorem from
Ramsey's theorem for pairs and identify an infinite decreasing hierarchy of
thin set theorems in reverse mathematics. This shows that in reverse
mathematics, the strength of Ramsey's theorem is very sensitive to the number
of colors in the output set. In particular, it enables us to answer several

many empirical complex networks is severely reduced owing to the presence of an
inherent global directionality. Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a
simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter $\gamma$ controls the
degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the
model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also
feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and
feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio-
technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical
networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network
randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively
reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter
$\gamma$. Moreover, the fitted value of $\gamma$ correlates quite well with
another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a
novel algorithm. We conclude that the existence of an inherent network
directionality provides a parsimonious quantitative explanation for the
observed lack of feedback loops in empirical networks.

module over commutative ring is morphism of corresponding representation. This
definition is the main subject of the book.
  To consider this definition from more general point of view I started the
book from consideration of Cartesian product of representations. Polymorphism
of representations is a map of Cartesian product of representations which is a
morphism of representations with respect to each separate independent variable.
Reduced morphism of representations allows us to simplify the study of
morphisms of representations. However a representation has to satisfy specific
requirements for existence of reduced polymomorphism of representations. It is
possible that Abelian group is only $\Omega$-algebra, such that representation
in this algebra admits polymorphism of representations. However, today, this
statement has not been proved.
  Multiplicative $\Omega$-group is $\Omega$-algebra in which product is
defined. The definition of tensor product of representations of Abelian
multiplicative $\Omega$-group is based on properties of reduced polymorphism of
representations of Abelian multiplicative $\Omega$-group.
  Since an algebra is a module in which the product is defined, then we can use
this theory to study linear map of algebra. For instance, we can study the set
of linear transformations of $D$-algebra $A$ as representation of algebra
$A\otimes A$ in algebra $A$.

construction technique based on local symmetries which allows the design of
