2010] as a model of transportation networks. We show that any such graph can be
embedded into a distribution over bounded treewidth graphs with arbitrarily
small distortion. More concretely, given a weighted graph G = (V, E) of
constant highway dimension, we show how to randomly compute a weighted graph H
= (V, E') that distorts shortest path distances of G by at most a 1 +
${\varepsilon}$ factor in expectation, and whose treewidth is polylogarithmic
in the aspect ratio of G. Our probabilistic embedding implies quasi-polynomial
time approximation schemes for a number of optimization problems that naturally
arise in transportation networks, including Travelling Salesman, Steiner Tree,
and Facility Location.
  To construct our embedding for low highway dimension graphs we extend
Talwar's [STOC 2004] embedding of low doubling dimension metrics into bounded
treewidth graphs, which generalizes known results for Euclidean metrics. We add
several non-trivial ingredients to Talwar's techniques, and in particular
thoroughly analyse the structure of low highway dimension graphs. Thus we
demonstrate that the geometric toolkit used for Euclidean metrics extends
beyond the class of low doubling metrics.

photostimulation method on single-mitochondrion level by tightly-focused
femtosecond laser that can precisely activate restorable fragmentation of
mitochondria which soon recover their original tubular structure after tens of
seconds. In this process, series of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(mROS) flashes are observed and found very critical to mitochondrial
fragmentation. Meanwhile, transient openings of mitochondrial permeability
transition pores (mPTP), suggested by oscillations of mitochondrial membrane
potential, contribute to the scavenging of redundant mROS and recovery of
fragmented mitochondria. Those results demonstrate photostimulation as an
active, precise and controllable method for the study of mitochondrial
oxidative and morphological dynamics or related fields.

in mid-IR images, but it is in fact a long ($\gtrsim$45 pc) cloud, well
consistent with a CO cloud at $v\sim23$ \kms\ (or at $d\sim$1.7 kpc). We
present a point-source catalog of IRDC G53.2 that contains $\sim$370 sources
from our photometry of the {\it Spitzer} MIPS 24 \um\ data and Galactic Legacy

identified sources based on their spectral index and control field analysis to
remove field star contamination reveals that IRDC G53.2 is an active
star-forming region with $\sim$300 YSO candidates. We compare the YSO
classification based on spectral index, mid-IR colors, and the wavelength range
used, which results in consistent classification, except for flat-spectrum
objects, with some ambiguity between Class I and II. Comparison of the YSO
population in IRDC G53.2 with those of other nearby star-forming clusters
indicates that they are similar in age; on the other hand, stronger association
with mid-IR stellar sources in IRDC G53.2 compared with other IRDCs indicates
that IRDC G53.2 is at a later evolutionary stage among IRDCs. Spatial
distribution of the YSO candidates in IRDC G53.2 shows a good correlation with

transport properties calculations in orthorhombic $n$- and $p$-type SnSe,
applying Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method and Boltzmann transport approach. The
analysis accounted for temperature effect on crystallographic parameters in
$Pnma$ structure as well as the phase transition to $CmCm$ structure at
$T_c\sim 807 $K. Remarkable modifications of conduction and valence bands were
notified upon varying crystallographic parameters within the structure before
$T_c$, while the phase transition mostly leads to jump in the band gap value.
The diagonal components of kinetic parameter tensors (velocity, effective mass)
and resulting transport quantity tensors (electrical conductivity $\sigma$,
thermopower $S$ and power factor PF) were computed in wide range of temperature
($15-900 $K) and, hole ($p-$type) and electron ($n-$type) concentration
($10^{17}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$). SnSe is shown to have strong anisotropy of the
electron transport properties for both types of charge conductivity, as
expected for the layered structure. In general, $p$-type effective masses are
larger than $n$-type ones. Interestingly, $p$-type SnSe has strongly
non-parabolic dispersion relations, with the 'pudding-mold'-like shape of the
highest valence band. The analysis of $\sigma$, $S$ and PF tensors indicates,
that the inter-layer electron transport is beneficial for thermoelectric
performance in $n$-type SnSe, while this direction is blocked in $p$-type SnSe,
where in-plane transport is preferred. Our results predict, that $n$-type SnSe
is potentially even better thermoelectric material than $p$-type one.
Theoretical results are compared with single crystal $p$-SnSe measurements, and
good agreement is found.

number of recent papers with a primary focus on two structural parameters: the
minimum number of preemptions necessary, and a tight lower bound on `shifts',
i.e., the sizes of intervals bounded by the times created by preemptions, job
starts, or completions. So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been
derived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these
structural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive
scheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with
release dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on
two processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of
scheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant
generalization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant
simplification leads to tractable problem.
  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for
optimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order
$\Omega(\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be
less than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of
optimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for
linear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers. The
bounds immediately follow from a fundamental structural property called
`normality', by which minimal shifts of a job are exponentially decreasing
functions. In particular, the first interval between a preempted job's start
and its preemption is a multiple of 1/2, the second such interval is a multiple
of 1/4, and in general, the $i$-th preemption occurs at a multiple of $2^{-i}$.
We expect the new structural properties to play a prominent role in finally
settling a vexing, still-open question of complexity.

determine how the conditions of the dense gas varies across the circumnuclear
regions in starburst galaxies. Methods. Using the IRAM-30m telescope, we mapped
the distribution of the CS(2-1) and CS(3-2) lines in the circumnuclear regions
of the nearby starburst galaxies NGC 3079 and NGC 6946. We also detected the
formaldehyde (H2CO) and methanol (CH3OH) in both galaxies. We marginally detect
the isotopologue C34S. Results. We calculate column densities under LTE
conditions for CS and CH3OH. Using the detections accumulated here to guide our
inputs, we link a time and depth dependent chemical model with a molecular line
radiative transfer model; we reproduce the observations, showing how conditions
where CS is present are likely to vary away from the galactic centres.
Conclusions. Using the rotational diagram method for CH3OH, we obtain a lower
limit temperature of 14 K. In addition to this, by comparing the chemical and
radiative transfer models to observations, we determine the properties of the
dense gas as traced by CS (and CH3OH). We also estimate the quantity of the
dense gas. We find that, provided that there are a between 10^5 and 10^6 dense
cores in our beam, for both target galaxies, emission of CS from warm (T = 100
- 400 K), dense (n(H2) = 10^5-6 cm-3) cores, possibly with a high cosmic ray
ionisation rate (zeta = 100 zeta0) best describes conditions for our central
pointing. In NGC 6946, conditions are generally cooler and/or less dense
further from the centre, whereas in NGC 3079, conditions are more uniform. The
inclusion of shocks allows for more efficient CS formation, leading to an order
of magnitude less dense gas being required to replicate observations in some
cases.

there are $n$ users of $r$ types; users of the same type provide similar
pairwise comparisons for $m$ items according to the Bradley-Terry model. We
propose an efficient algorithm that accurately estimates the individual
preferences for almost all users, if there are $r \max \{m, n\}\log m \log^2 n$
pairwise comparisons per type, which is near optimal in sample complexity when
$r$ only grows logarithmically with $m$ or $n$. Our algorithm has three steps:
first, for each user, compute the \emph{net-win} vector which is a projection
of its $\binom{m}{2}$-dimensional vector of pairwise comparisons onto an
$m$-dimensional linear subspace; second, cluster the users based on the net-win
vectors; third, estimate a single preference for each cluster separately. The
net-win vectors are much less noisy than the high dimensional vectors of
pairwise comparisons and clustering is more accurate after the projection as
confirmed by numerical experiments. Moreover, we show that, when a cluster is
only approximately correct, the maximum likelihood estimation for the

programming languages and proof assistants, but conceal at least two
fundamental theoretical problems already in the presence of the simplest
non-trivial data type, the sum type. First, we do not know of an explicit and
implemented algorithm for deciding the beta-eta-equality of terms---and this in
spite of the first decidability results proven two decades ago. Second, it is
not clear how to decide when two types are essentially the same, i.e.
isomorphic, in spite of the meta-theoretic results on decidability of the
isomorphism.
  In this paper, we present the exp-log normal form of types---derived from the
representation of exponential polynomials via the unary exponential and
logarithmic functions---that any type built from arrows, products, and sums,
can be isomorphically mapped to. The type normal form can be used as a simple
heuristic for deciding type isomorphism, thanks to the fact that it is a
systematic application of the high-school identities.
  We then show that the type normal form allows to reduce the standard beta-eta
equational theory of the lambda calculus to a specialized version of itself,
while preserving the completeness of equality on terms. We end by describing an
alternative representation of normal terms of the lambda calculus with sums,
together with a Coq-implemented converter into/from our new term calculus. The
difference with the only other previously implemented heuristic for deciding
interesting instances of eta-equality by Balat, Di Cosmo, and Fiore, is that we
exploit the type information of terms substantially and this often allows us to
obtain a canonical representation of terms without performing sophisticated
term analyses.

generated by density fluctuations in the initial state rather than by geometric
overlap effects. For a given centrality class, the initial fluctuation spectrum
is sensitive to the method chosen for binning the events into centrality
classes. We show that sorting events by total initial entropy or by total final
multiplicity yields event classes with equivalent statistical fluctuation
properties, in spite of viscous entropy production during the fireball
evolution. With this initial entropy-based centrality definition we generate
several classes of ultra-central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies and evolve
the events using viscous hydrodynamics with non-zero shear but vanishing bulk
viscosity. Comparing the predicted anisotropic flow coefficients for charged
hadrons with CMS data we find that both the Monte Carlo Glauber (MC-Glb) and
Monte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models produce initial fluctuation
spectra that are incompatible with the measured final anisotropic flow power
spectrum, for any choice of the specific shear viscosity. In spite of this
failure, we show that the hydrodynamic model can qualitatively explain, in
terms of event-by-event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients and
flow angles, the breaking of flow factorization for elliptic, triangular and
quadrangular flow measured by the CMS experiment. For elliptic flow, this
factorization breaking is large in ultra-central collisions. We conclude that
the bulk of the experimentally observed flow factorization breaking effects are
qualitatively explained by hydrodynamic evolution of initial-state
fluctuations, but that their quantitative description requires a better
understanding of the initial fluctuation spectrum.

This extension is non-trivial and involves a number of new elements since, for
Lorentzian bivectors, the split into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts, on
which the Euclidean derivation was based, is no longer available. In fact, the
classical parts of the present derivation provide not only an extension to the
Lorentzian case, but also, with minor modifications, provide a new, more four
dimensionally covariant derivation for the Euclidean case. The new elements in
the quantum part of the derivation are due to the different structure of
unitary representations of the Lorentz group.

given closed manifold or an asymptotically flat one, is a long-standing and
much-studied problem. Solutions are characterized by a complete Riemannian
$n$-manifold $(M,g)$ and a positive function $N$, called the lapse. We study
this problem on Asymptotically Poincar\'e-Einstein $n$-manifolds, $n\ge 3$,
when the conformal boundary-at-infinity is either a round sphere, a flat torus
or smooth quotient thereof, or a compact hyperbolic manifold. Such manifolds
have well-defined Wang mass, and are time-symmetric slices of static, vacuum,
asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. By integrating a mildly generalized
form of an identity used by Lindblom, Shen, Wang, and others, we give a mass
formula for such manifolds. In consequence, we observe that either the lapse is
trivial and $(M,g)$ is Poincar\'e-Einstein or the Wang mass is negative, as in
the case of time symmetric slices of the AdS soliton. As an application, we use
the mass formula to compute the renormalized volume of the warped product
$(X,\gamma) = (M^3,g) \times_{N^2} (S^1,dt^2)$.
  We also give a mass formula for the case of a metric that is static in the
region exterior to a horizon on which the lapse function is zero. Then the
manifold $(X,\gamma)$ is said to have a ""bolt"" where the $S^1$ factor shrinks
to zero length. The renormalized volume of $(X,\gamma)$ is expected on physical
grounds to have the form of the free energy per unit temperature for a black
hole in equilibrium with a radiation bath at fixed temperature. When $M$ is
3-dimensional and admits a horizon, we apply this mass formula to compute the
renormalized volume of $(X,\gamma)$ and show that it indeed has the expected
thermodynamically motivated form.

relations for entities in a knowledge base. For example for an actor, such a
timeline should show the most important professional and personal milestones
and relationships such as works, awards, collaborations, and family
relationships. We develop three orthogonal timeline quality criteria that an
ideal timeline should satisfy: (1) it shows events that are relevant to the
entity; (2) it shows events that are temporally diverse, so they distribute
along the time axis, avoiding visual crowding and allowing for easy user
interaction, such as zooming in and out; and (3) it shows events that are
content diverse, so they contain many different types of events (e.g., for an
actor, it should show movies and marriages and awards, not just movies). We
present an algorithm to generate such timelines for a given time period and
screen size, based on submodular optimization and web-co-occurrence statistics
with provable performance guarantees. A series of user studies using Mechanical
Turk shows that all three quality criteria are crucial to produce quality
timelines and that our algorithm significantly outperforms various baseline and
state-of-the-art methods.

Our method generalizes to the multicomponent SU(n) cases with a combination of

single source, to multi-source, to many sources, and now toward {\em
crowdsource}. Such crowdsourced live streaming platforms as Twitch.tv allow
general users to broadcast their content to massive viewers, thereby greatly
expanding the content and user bases. The resources available for these
non-professional broadcasters however are limited and unstable, which
potentially impair the streaming quality and viewers' experience. The diverse
live interactions among the broadcasters and viewers can further aggravate the

  In this paper, we present an initial investigation on the modern crowdsourced
live streaming systems. Taking Twitch as a representative, we outline their
inside architecture using both crawled data and captured traffic of local
broadcasters/viewers. Closely examining the access data collected in a
two-month period, we reveal that the view patterns are determined by both
events and broadcasters' sources. Our measurements explore the unique source-
and event-driven views, showing that the current delay strategy on the viewer's
side substantially impacts the viewers' interactive experience, and there is
significant disparity between the long broadcast latency and the short live
messaging latency. On the broadcaster's side, the dynamic uploading capacity is
a critical challenge, which noticeably affects the smoothness of live streaming
for viewers.

in a rich behavior of the particles not easily foreseen from the consideration

To date, studies of rheotaxis have focused on elongated particles (e.g.,

active particles, for which the ""weather vane"" mechanism is excluded due to the
symmetry of the shape, may nevertheless exhibit rheotaxis. Combining analytical
and numerical calculations, we show that, for a broad class of spherical active

""self-trapping"" near a hard wall owing to the active propulsion of the

consider cosmological evolution for observable CMB scales from the time of
Hubble crossing to the present time. Depending upon the model, the duration and
final temperature after reheating, as well as its equation of state, may be
directly linked to inflationary observables. For single-field inflationary
models, if we approximate reheating by a constant equation of state, one can
derive relations between the reheating duration (or final temperature), its
equation of state parameter, and the scalar power spectrum amplitude and
spectral index. While this is a simple approximation, by restricting the
equation of state to lie within a broad physically allowed range, one can in
turn bracket an allowed range of $n_s$ and $r$ for these models. The added
constraints can help break degeneracies between inflation models that otherwise
overlap in their predictions for $n_s$ and $r$.

the situation as two games, between a Scanner and an Invader, and solve them
sequentially. The first game is formulated to design the optimal (in maxmin
sense) scanning algorithm, while the second one allows one to find the optimal
values of the parameters for the algorithm depending on parameters of the
network. These games provide solutions for two dilemmas that the rivals face.
The Invader's dilemma consists of the following: the more bandwidth the Invader
attempts to use leads to a larger payoff if he is not detected, but at the same
time also increases the probability of being detected and thus fined.
Similarly, the Scanner faces a dilemma: the wider the bandwidth scanned, the
higher the probability of detecting the Invader, but at the expense of
increasing the cost of building the scanning system. The equilibrium strategies
are found explicitly and reveal interesting properties. In particular, we have
found a discontinuous dependence of the equilibrium strategies on the network
parameters, fine and the type of the Invader's award. This discontinuity of the
fine means that the network provider has to take into account a human/social
factor since some threshold values of fine could be very sensible for the
Invader, while in other situations simply increasing the fine has minimal
deterrence impact. Also we show how incomplete information about the Invader's
technical characteristics and reward (e.g. motivated by using different type of

properties, such as the electronic reconstruction at their internal interfaces

field from the polar layers is inversion-symmetry breaking and generates a
Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in the interfacial electronic system. We
investigate the quantum capacitance of a heterostructure in which a sizeable
RSOC at a metallic interface is controlled by the electric field of a surface
electrode. Such a structure is, for example, given by a LaAlO_3 film on a
SrTiO_3 substrate which is gated by a top electrode. Such heterostructures can
exhibit a strong enhancement of their capacitance [Li et al., Science 332, 825
(2011)]. The capacitance is related to the electronic compressibility of the
heterostructure, but the two quantities are not equivalent. In fact, the
transfer of charge to the interface controls the relation between capacitance
and compressibility. We find that due to a strong RSOC, the quantum capacitance
can be larger than the classical geometric value. However, in contrast to the
results of recent investigations [Caprara et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 196401

similar to the so-called no hair theorem since their late time profile is
stationary and uniquely fixed by parameters entering the Hamiltonian and

finds a macroscopic undulation in the supersonic side which has either a fixed

representations of video sequences. Our model uses an encoder LSTM to map an
input sequence into a fixed length representation. This representation is
decoded using single or multiple decoder LSTMs to perform different tasks, such
as reconstructing the input sequence, or predicting the future sequence. We
experiment with two kinds of input sequences - patches of image pixels and
high-level representations (""percepts"") of video frames extracted using a
pretrained convolutional net. We explore different design choices such as
whether the decoder LSTMs should condition on the generated output. We analyze
the outputs of the model qualitatively to see how well the model can
extrapolate the learned video representation into the future and into the past.
We try to visualize and interpret the learned features. We stress test the
model by running it on longer time scales and on out-of-domain data. We further
evaluate the representations by finetuning them for a supervised learning
problem - human action recognition on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. We show
that the representations help improve classification accuracy, especially when
there are only a few training examples. Even models pretrained on unrelated
datasets (300 hours of YouTube videos) can help action recognition performance.

based on a recently proposed tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) [1].
Using this factorization one can derive notion of tensor rank, referred to as
the tensor tubal rank, which has optimality properties similar to that of
matrix rank derived from SVD. As shown in [2] some multidimensional data, such
as panning video sequences exhibit low tensor tubal rank and we look at the
problem of completing such data under random sampling of the data cube. We show
that by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes the tensor
nuclear norm obtained as the convex relaxation of tensor tubal rank, one can
guarantee recovery with overwhelming probability as long as samples in
proportion to the degrees of freedom in t-SVD are observed. In this sense our
results are order-wise optimal. The conditions under which this result holds
are very similar to the incoherency conditions for the matrix completion,
albeit we define incoherency under the algebraic set-up of t-SVD. We show the
performance of the algorithm on some real data sets and compare it with other
existing approaches based on tensor flattening and Tucker decomposition.

inhomogeneously distributed discrete structures (galaxies, groups and clusters

to study the Universe deep inside the cell of uniformity. More precisely, we
study scalar perturbations of the FLRW metric due to inhomogeneities of CDM as
well as fluctuations of radiation and DE. For an arbitrary equation of state
for DE we obtain a system of equations for the scalar perturbations within the

3C 279 conducted during a phase of increased activity from 2013 December to
2014 April, including first observations of it with NuSTAR. The $\gamma$-ray
emission of the source measured by Fermi-LAT showed multiple distinct flares
reaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning of
the Fermi mission, with $F(E > 100\,{\rm MeV})$ of $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, and with a flux doubling time scale as short as 2 hours. The
$\gamma$-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of
$\Gamma_\gamma = 1.7 \pm 0.1$, which is rarely seen in flat spectrum radio
quasars. The lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high Compton
dominance parameter $L_\gamma/L_{\rm syn} > 300$. Two 1-day NuSTAR observations
with accompanying Swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing different
levels of source activity. While the 0.5$-$70 keV X-ray spectrum obtained
during the first pointing, and fitted jointly with Swift-XRT is well-described
by a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectral
structure: the spectrum softens by $\Delta\Gamma_{\rm X} \simeq 0.4$ at $\sim$4
keV. Modeling the broad-band SED during this flare with the standard
synchrotron plus inverse Compton model requires: (1) the location of the
$\gamma$-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad line region radius,
(2) a very hard electron energy distribution index $p \simeq 1$, (3) total jet
power significantly exceeding the accretion disk luminosity $L_{\rm j}/L_{\rm
d} \gtrsim 10$, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with $L_{\rm B}/L_{\rm

ensembles of instances of these problems have been studied previously in an
attempt to elucidate their typical, as opposed to worst case, behavior. In this
paper we introduce a new statistical ensemble that interpolates between
classical and quantum. For the simplest 2-SAT/2-QSAT ensemble we find the exact
boundary that separates SAT and UNSAT instances. We do so by establishing
coincident lower and upper bounds, in the limit of large instances, on the
extent of the UNSAT and SAT regions, respectively.

relatively important at epochs just before phase transitions. For a viable
cosmology the vacuum energy just after a phase transition must be set by the
critical temperature of the next phase transition, which exposes the
cosmological constant problem from a different angle. Here we propose to
experimentally test the properties of vacuum energy under circumstances
different from our current vacuum. One promising avenue is to consider the
effect of high density phases of QCD in neutron stars. Such phases have
different vacuum expectation values and a different vacuum energy from the
normal phase, which can contribute an order one fraction to the mass of neutron
stars. Precise observations of the mass of neutron stars can potentially yield
information about the gravitational properties of vacuum energy, which can
significantly affect their mass-radius relation. A more direct test of cosmic
evolution of vacuum energy could be inferred from a precise observation of the
primordial gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies corresponding to phase
transitions. While traditional cosmology predicts steps in the spectrum
determined by the number of degrees of freedom both for the QCD and electroweak
phase transitions, an adjustment mechanism for vacuum energy could
significantly change this. In addition, there might be other phase transitions
where the effect of vacuum energy could show up as a peak in the spectrum.

solar wind to compute the cascade rate of turbulence. In the absence of a mean
field B0=0, Y is expected to be isotropic (radial) and independent of the
direction of increments, so its measure yields directly the cascade rate. For
turbulence with mean field, as in the solar wind, Y is expected to become more
two dimensional (2D), that is, to have larger perpendicular components, loosing
the above simple symmetry. To get the cascade rate one should compute the flux
of Y, which is not feasible with single-spacecraft data, thus measurements rely
upon assumptions about the unknown symmetry. We use direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to characterize the
anisotropy of Y. We find that for strong guide field B0=5 the degree of
two-dimensionalization depends on the relative importance of shear and pseudo
polarizations (the two components of an Alfv\'en mode in incompressible MHD).
The anisotropy also shows up in the inertial range. The more Y is 2D, the more
the inertial range extent differs along parallel and perpendicular directions.
We finally test the two methods employed in observations and find that the
so-obtained cascade rate may depend on the angle between B0 and the direction
of increments. Both methods yield a vanishing cascade rate along the parallel
direction, contrary to observations, suggesting a weaker anisotropy of solar
wind turbulence compared to our DNS. This could be due to a weaker mean field
and/or to solar wind expansion.

binary (0.0875$\pm$0.0021 arcsec, 0.93$^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$ AU) from Keck laser
guide star adaptive optics imaging. Our photometry for this system reveals that
both components are less luminous than those in any known substellar binary.
Combining a new integrated-light spectrum (T9p) and resolved YJH-band
photometry from Keck allows us to perform spectral decomposition and assign
component types of T9 and Y0. Many of the unusual features in the spectrum
might be explained by high surface gravity: Y-band peak broadened to the blue;
J-band peak broadened to the red; H-band peak shifted slightly to the red; and
red Y-J colors. Interestingly, the very low component luminosities imply that
the T9 primary is unexpectedly cold ($T_{\rm eff}$ = 345$\pm$45 K assuming an
age of 10 Gyr), making it $\approx$100 K cooler than any other late-T dwarf and
comparable to Y dwarfs. One intriguing explanation for this apparent
discrepancy is that the J- and H-band spectral features that trigger the
transition from T to Y spectral types are highly gravity-dependent. This can be
tested directly in the very near future by orbit monitoring. We constrain the
orbital period to be $\lesssim$10 yr by combining evolutionary model-based mass
estimates for the components ($\approx$12$-$21 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 1$\sigma$ at 10
Gyr) with a statistical constraint on the semimajor axis ($\lesssim$1.3 AU).
Such a period is shorter than any other known T/Y transition binary, meaning
that WISEJ0146+4234AB will likely yield a dynamical mass within the next few
years.

color selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate Lyman
continuum (LyC) emitters. The intergalactic medium prescription of Inoue et
al.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of Bruzual&Charlot (2003) have been used
to properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of the
intergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. Color
tracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizing
radiation. At variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of IGM
transmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-band
color selection. The decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons with
increasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the LyC to
broad-band colors. We also demonstrate that prominent LyC sources can be
selected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a null
escaping ionizing radiation. The method is applied to a sample of galaxies
extracted from the GOODS-S field. A known LyC source at z=3.795 is successfully
recovered as a LyC emitter candidate and another convincing candidate at
z=3.212 is reported. A detailed analysis of the two sources (including their
variability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar and
non-stellar (AGN) contribution in the ultraviolet. Conclusions: Classical
broad-band color selection of 2.5<z<4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusion
of LyC emitters in the selected samples. Large fesc in relatively bright
galaxies (L>0.1L*) could be favored by the presence of a faint AGN not easily
detected at any wavelength. A hybrid stellar and non-stellar (AGN) ionizing

galaxies. Of issue in order to characterize galaxy formation models is to
determine the relative fraction of baryons and dark matter at all radii in
galaxies. For disk galaxies, various measurements of the mass distribution in
galaxies based on vertical kinematics, strong lensing, residuals of scaling
relations, fluid dynamical modeling, bar strength and pattern speed, warps, and
others, have called for either a maximal or sub-maximal contribution of the
baryons in the inner parts of the disk. We propose a global picture whereby all
galaxies are typically baryon-dominated (maximal) at the center and dark-matter
dominated (sub-maximal) in their outskirts. Using as a fiducial radius the peak
of the rotation curve of a pure baryonic exponential disk at R_2.2=2.2 Rd,
where Rd is the disk scale length, the transition from maximal to sub-maximal
baryons occurs within or near R_2.2 for low-mass disk galaxies (with V_tot <
200 km/s) and beyond R_2.2 for more massive systems. The mass fraction's
inverse dependence on circular velocity in disk galaxies is largely insensitive
to the presence of a bar at R_2.2. The mean mass fractions of late- and
early-type galaxies are shown to be different at the same fiducial radius and
circular velocity, pointing to different galaxy formation mechanisms. Feedback,
dynamical friction, size, and IMF variations are key ingredients for
understanding these differences.

significantly with the depth of the surveys, and deeper surveys do necessarily
not probe higher redshifts. Paradoxically, at fixed wavelength and flux limit,
the lensed sources are not always at higher redshift. We found that the higher
redshift of 1.4 mm-selected south pole telescope (SPT) sources compared to
other SMG surveys is not only caused by the lensing selection, but also by the
longer wavelength. This SPT sample is expected to be dominated by a population
of lensed main-sequence galaxies and a minor contribution ($\sim$10\%) of

'fingertips' on the projected outskirts of the flow show proper motions of ~300
km/s. High-velocity, sub-arcsecond H2 knots ('bullets') are seen as far as 140""

Orion A cloud, their survival sets a lower bound on their densities of order
10^7 cm^-3, consistent with an origin within a few au of a massive star and
accelerated by a final multi-body dynamic encounter that ejected the BN object
and radio source I from OMC1 about 500 years ago. Conclusions. Over 120
high-velocity bow-shocks propagating in nearly all directions from the OMC1

Such events may be linked to the origin of runaway, massive stars.

that detecting emission lines in the planetary spectrum, as opposed to

  We do not detect any significant absorption or emission of CO in the dayside

either with CO absorption lines or with weak emission at the core of the lines
show a low-significance correlation signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 -

  The non-detection of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458 b is interesting
in light of a previous CO detection in the transmission spectrum. That there is
no signal indicates that HD 209458 b either has a nearly isothermal atmosphere

associated with OB supergiant companions and characterised by an X-ray flaring
behaviour whose dynamical range reaches 5 orders of magnitude on timescales of
a few hundred to thousands of seconds. Current investigations concentrate on
finding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in SFXTs and explain their
unusually low average X-ray luminosity. We present the Swift observations of an
exceptionally bright outburst displayed by the SFXT IGR J17544-2619 on 2014
October 10 when the source achieved a peak luminosity of $3\times10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. This extends the total source dynamic range to $\gtrsim$10$^6$, the
largest (by a factor of 10) recorded so far from an SFXT. Tentative evidence
for pulsations at a period of 11.6 s is also reported. We show that these
observations challenge, for the first time, the maximum theoretical luminosity
achievable by an SFXT and propose that this giant outburst was due to the
formation of a transient accretion disc around the compact object.

constrain the possible scenarios that could lead to their existence. While it
is sometimes possible to determine the mass of the primary star, for
single-lined spectroscopic binaries it is not trivial to have good estimates of
the mass of the secondary. If a large enough sample of such binaries is
available, it is possible, however, to use statistical methods to determine the
mass ratio distribution, and thus, the secondary mass distribution. Recently,
Andrews et al. (2014) studied the mass distribution of companions to extremely
low-mass white dwarfs, using a sample of binaries from the ELM WD Survey. I
reanalyse the same sample, using two different methods: in the first one, I
assume some functional form for the mass distribution, while in the second, I
apply an inversion method. I show that the resulting companion-mass
distribution can be as well approximated by either a uniform distribution or a
Gaussian distribution. The mass ratio distribution derived from the inversion
method, without assuming any a priori functional form, shows some additional
fine-grain structure, although, given the small sample, it is difficult to
claim that this structure is statistically significant. I conclude that it is
not possible yet to fully constrain the distribution of the mass of the
companions to extremely low-mass white dwarfs, although it appears that the
probability to have a neutron star in one of the systems is indeed very small.

in the long term behavior survival probability of unstable states is a
decreasing function of the cosmological time and has the inverse power-like
form. This implies that cosmological constant $\rho_{\text{vac}} = \Lambda(t) =
\Lambda_{\text{bare}} + \frac{\alpha}{t^2}$ where $\Lambda_{\text{bare}}$ and
$\alpha$ are constants. We investigate the dynamics of this model using
dynamical system methods due to a link to the $\Lambda(H)$ cosmologies. We have
found the exact solution for the scale factor as well as the indicators of its
variability like the deceleration parameter and the jerk. From the calculation
of the jerk we obtain a simple test of the decaying vacuum in the FRW universe.
Using astronomical data (SNIa, $H(z)$, CMB, BAO) we have estimated the model
parameters and compared this model with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our statistical
results indicate that the decaying vacuum model is a little worse than the
$\Lambda$CDM model. But the decaying vacuum cosmological model explains the

mass ejections (CMEs), although relatively rare, can provide valuable plasma
and 3D geometry diagnostics. We report the first observations by the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) mission of a spectacular fast CME/prominence
eruption associated with an equivalent X1.6 flare on 2014 May 9. The maximum
plane-of-sky and Doppler velocities of the eruption are 1200 and 460 km/s,
respectively. There are two eruption components separated by ~200 km/s in
Doppler velocity: a primary, bright component and a secondary, faint component,
suggesting a hollow, rather than solid, cone-shaped distribution of material.
The eruption involves a left-handed helical structure undergoing
counter-clockwise (viewed top-down) unwinding motion. There is a temporal
evolution from upward eruption to downward fallback with less-than-free-fall
speeds and decreasing nonthermal line widths. We find a wide range of Mg II k/h
line intensity ratios (less than ~2 expected for optically-thin thermal
emission): the lowest ever-reported median value of 1.17 found in the fallback
material and a comparably high value of 1.63 in nearby coronal rain and
intermediate values of 1.53 and 1.41 in the two eruption components. The
fallback material exhibits a strong ($> 5 \sigma$) linear correlation between
the k/h ratio and the Doppler velocity as well as the line intensity. We
demonstrate that Doppler dimming of scattered chromospheric emission by the
erupted material can potentially explain such characteristics.

transform under the fundamental representation. These SU($N$) spin chains are
known to be quantum critical and described by a well known Wess-Zumino-Witten
(WZW) non-linear sigma model in the continuum limit. Numerical results from our
lattice Hamiltonian are obtained using stochastic series expansion (SSE)
quantum Monte Carlo for both closed and open boundary conditions. As expected
for this 1D critical system, the REE shows a logarithmic dependence on the
subsystem size with a prefector given by the central charge of the SU($N$) WZW
model. We study in detail the sub-leading oscillatory terms in the REE under
both periodic and open boundaries. Each oscillatory term is associated with a
WZW field and decays as a power law with an exponent proportional to the
scaling dimension of the corresponding field. We find that the use of periodic
boundaries (where oscillations are less prominent) allows for a better estimate
of the central charge, while using open boundaries allows for a better estimate
of the scaling dimensions. For completeness we also present numerical data on
the thermal R\'{e}nyi entropy which equally allows for extraction of the
central charge.

satellites when planet oblateness is not accounted for in non-coplanar
multiplanet systems. Simulations include two secularly interacting Jupiter-mass
planets mutually inclined by 10 degrees, with the host planet either oblate or
spherical. With a spherical host planet, moons within a critical planetocentric
distance experience high inclinations and in some cases high eccentricities,
while more distant moons orbit stably with low inclinations and eccentricities,
as expected. These counter-intuitive dynamical phenomena disappear with an
oblate host planet, in which case the moons' Laplace plane transitions from the
host planet's equatorial plane to the host planet's precessing orbital plane as
their semi-major axes increase, and all moons are dynamically stable with very
mild changes in orbits. Direct perturbation from the perturbing planet has been
investigated and ruled out as an explanation for the behavior of the innermost
satellites, therefore leaving the central star's perturbation as the cause.
Instability occurs while the nodal precession of the satellite and the central
star (as seen from the host planet's frame) approaches the 1:1 secular
resonance. In non-coplanar systems, around a non-oblate planet, the nodal
precession of the moon becomes slow and comparable to that of the planet,
giving rise to resonant configurations. The above effect needs to be taken into
account in setting up numerical simulations.

Sampling (FW-CADIS) being a particularly successful example. However, locations

calculations that contain regions of combined space and energy self-shielding
without significant impact on the solution quality in other parts of the

ballooning phase angles, ${p}$, to map out the local complex mode frequency,
${\Omega_{0}(x,p)=\omega_{0}(x,p)+i\gamma_{0}(x,p)}$ for a single toroidal mode

Fourier-ballooning representation leads to a second order ODE for the amplitude
envelope, ${A\left(p\right)}$ , which describes how the local results are
combined to form the global mode. We employ the so-called CYCLONE base case for
circular Miller equilibrium model. Assuming radially varying profiles of
${a/L_{T}}$ and ${a/L_{n}}$, peaked at ${x=0}$, and with all other equilibrium
profiles held constant, ${\Omega_{0}(x,p)}$ is found to have a stationary
point. The reconstructed global mode sits at the outboard mid-plane of the
tokamak, with global growth rate, ${\gamma\sim}$Max${\left[\gamma_{0}\right]}$.
Including the radial variation of other equilibrium profiles like safety factor
and magnetic shear, leads to a mode that peaks away from the outboard
mid-plane, with a reduced global growth rate. Finally, the influence of
toroidal flow shear has also been investigated through the introduction of a
Doppler shift, ${\omega_{0} \rightarrow \omega_{0} - n\Omega_{\phi}^{\prime}
x}$, where ${\Omega_{\phi}}$ is the equilibrium toroidal flow, and a prime
denotes the radial derivative. The equilibrium profile variations introduce an
asymmetry into the global growth rate spectrum with respect to the sign of
${\Omega_{\phi}^{\prime}}$, such that the maximum growth rate is achieved with
non-zero shearing, consistent with recent global gyrokinetic calculations.

HERMES spectrograph provides high-resolution (R ~28,000) spectra in four

of the survey is to unravel the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky
Way, using fossil remnants of ancient star formation events which have been
disrupted and are now dispersed throughout the Galaxy. Chemical tagging seeks
to identify such dispersed remnants solely from their common and unique
chemical signatures; these groups are unidentifiable from their spatial,
photometric or kinematic properties. To carry out chemical tagging, the GALAH
survey will acquire spectra for a million stars down to V~14. The HERMES
spectra of FGK stars contain absorption lines from 29 elements including light
proton-capture elements, alpha-elements, odd-Z elements, iron-peak elements and
n-capture elements from the light and heavy s-process and the r-process. This

consider integrated information as a coupling between two separate entities -
physical information (that implies data processing) and semantic information

intelligence becomes a product of information processing. Extending further
this line of thinking, it can be said that information processing does not
require more a human brain for its implementation. Indeed, bacteria and amoebas
exhibit intelligent behavior without any sign of a brain. That dramatically
removes the need for AI systems to emulate the human brain complexity! The

pointed out that a variational wave function $\Psi_Q$, which includes the key
ingredient (doublon-holon binding effect) for a Mott transition, yields a
positive $D$ (namely metallic) even in the Mott-insulating regime. We argue
that, to obtain a correct $D$, an imaginary part must exist in the wave
function. By introducing a configuration-dependent phase factor ${\cal

($D=0$ for $U>U_{\rm c}$) for a normal and $d$-wave pairing states; thereby,
the problem of Millis and Coppersmith is settled. Generally, ${\cal P}_\theta$
plays a pivotal role in describing current-carrying states in regimes of Mott

fundamental difficulty in making the McLE approach practicable is the selection
from numerous candidate likelihood objects for constructing the composite

the unknown parameters in equilibrium, since sub-likelihood objects are chosen
with probability depending on the variance of the corresponding McLE. A

finite temperature. The gravity dual is obtained as a solution of the type IIB
superstring theory with two free parameters, which correspond to four
dimensional (4D) cosmological constant ($\lambda$) and the dark radiation ($C$)
respectively. The theory studied here is in confining and chiral symmetry
broken phase for $\lambda <0$ and small $C$. When $C$ is increased, the
transition to the deconfinement phase has been observed at a finite value of
$C/|\lambda|$. It is shown here that the chiral symmetry is still broken for a
finite range of $C/|\lambda|$ in the deconfinement phase. In other words, the
chiral phase transition occurs at a larger value of $C/|\lambda|$ than the one
of the deconfinement transition. So there is a parameter range of a new
deconfinement phase with broken chiral symmetry. In order to study the
properties of this phase, we performed a holographic analysis for the meson
mass-spectrum and other quantities in terms of the probe D7 brane. The results
of this analysis are compared with a linear sigma model. Furthermore, the
entanglement entropy is examined to search for a sign of the chiral phase
trantion. Several comments are given for these analyses.

schedule remains difficult because of production delays and fluctuations in
demand and supply of materials. The response of manufacturing systems to such
disruptions to dynamic behavior has been rarely studied. To capture these
responses, we investigate a process that models the assembly of parts into end
products. The complete assembly process is represented by a directed tree,
where the smallest parts are injected at leaves and the end products are
removed at the root. A discrete assembly process, represented by a node on the
network, integrates parts, which are then sent to the next downstream node as a
single part. The model exhibits some intriguing phenomena, including overstock
cascade, phase transition in terms of demand and supply fluctuations,
nonmonotonic distribution of stockout in the network, and the formation of a
stockout path and stockout chains. Surprisingly, these rich phenomena result
from only the nature of distributed assembly processes. From a physical
perspective, these phenomena provide insight into delay dynamics and inventory
distributions in large-scale manufacturing systems.

achieved by the application of the randomized LU decomposition to a training

outperforms SVD in these categories and works also extremely well on large
sparse matrices. In contrast to existing methods, the randomized LU
decomposition constructs an under-complete dictionary, which simplifies both
the construction and the classification processes of newly arrived signals. The
dictionary construction is generic and general that fits different

performed nowadays for example by sandboxing mechanism, deep packet inspection,
firewalls and anti-virus systems. We propose a content-based method that
detects file types that neither depend on file extension nor on metadata. Such

whole file are needed for a successful classification. Based on the constructed
dictionaries, we show that the proposed method can effectively identify

enhanced depth resolution has been developed using standard Auger microprobe

sample is partly covered by an appropriate mask. Utilising the edge of this
mask, the sample is sputtered in the Auger microprobe with ions at nearly
grazing incidence. In the shadow of the mask, this produces a low angle cross
section through the thin film system. Then, a conventional depth profile is
measured at the point of interest where part of the thin film system is covered
only by a thin top layer. As demonstrated a considerable improvement of depth
resolution delta z / z can be obtained by this method.

presented. Application of the $\tau$-approximation yields good agreement with
the diffusion approximation for the prestellar phase, but produces appreciable

by dispersion relations, whose subtraction constants and left cut contribution
can be approximately obtained in different ways giving rise to different
unitarization procedures. We illustrate the ideas with the Inverse Amplitude
Method, one version of the N/D method and another improved version of the
K-matrix. In the three cases we get partial waves which are unitary, analytical
with the proper left and right cuts and in some cases poles in the second
Riemann sheet that can be understood as dynamically generated resonances. In
addition they reproduce at Next to Leading Order (NLO) the perturbative
expansion for the five partial waves not vanishing (up to J=2) and they are
renormalization scale ($\mu$) independent. Also the unitarization formalisms
are extended to the coupled channel case. Then we apply the results to the
elastic scattering amplitude for the longitudinal components of the gauge
bosons $V=W, Z$ at high energy. We also compute $h h \rightarrow h h$ and the
inelastic process $VV\rightarrow h h$ which are coupled to the elastic $VV$

in practice, and almost every non-trivial software system relies heavily on the
use of libraries of reusable components. Recently, Lustig and Vardi introduced
dataflow and controlflow synthesis from libraries of reusable components. They
proved that dataflow synthesis is undecidable, while controlflow synthesis is
decidable. The problem of controlflow synthesis from libraries of probabilistic

decidable for qualitative analysis (that asks that the specification be
satisfied with probability 1). Our main contributions for controlflow synthesis
from probabilistic components are to establish better complexity bounds for the

stress fields surrounding a crack's tip. We verify these predictions by
performing extensive experiments on the fracture of soft brittle elastomers
over a range of loading levels and propagation velocities, showing that the
newly developed framework offers significantly better approximations to the
measurements than standard approaches at moderately large levels of external
loadings and high propagation velocities. This framework should be relevant to

to be transient if it can be moved by a homotopy within the subspace to the
trivial knot in $S^3$. To show this, we discuss relation between certain
group-theoretic and homotopic properties of knots in a compact 3-manifold,
which can be of independent interest. Further, using the notion of transient

isolating the contribution of each of these regions, the model shows the surge
to originate primarily in a single high-latitude activity group consisting of a
bipolar active region present in Carrington Rotations 2104-05 (November

long-term contribution to the polar field, because of its location at high
latitude. This is in accordance with previous flux transport models.

coverage dependence of the H adsorption energies: Initially, O--H bond
formation is energetically favorable and H acting as an electron donor leads to
the formation of a charge accumulation layer and to surface metallization. The
increase of the number of O--H bonds leads to a reversal in adsorption energies
such that Zn--H bonds become favored at sites close to existing O--H bonds,
which results in a gradual extenuation of the metallization. The corresponding
surface potential changes are localized within a few nanometers both laterally
and normal to the surface. This localized character is experimentally
corroborated by using sub-surface bound excitons at the
ZnO(10${\overline{1}}$0) surface as a local probe. The pronounced and
comparably localized effect of small amounts of hydrogen at this surface
strongly suggests metallic character of ZnO surfaces under technologically

introduced in the sixties (with a view to applications in Psychology or
learning automata), whose convergence has been intensively studied in the
stochastic algorithm literature. In this paper, we adress the following
question: are the Narendra-Shapiro (NS) bandit algorithms competitive from a
\textit{regret} point of view? In our main result, we show that some
competitive bounds can be obtained for such algorithms in their penalized
version (introduced in \cite{Lamberton_Pages}). More precisely, up to an
over-penalization modification, the pseudo-regret $\bar{R}_n$ related to the
penalized two-armed bandit algorithm is uniformly bounded by $C \sqrt{n}$
(where $C$ is made explicit in the paper). \noindent We also generalize
existing convergence and rates of convergence results to the multi-armed case
of the over-penalized bandit algorithm, including the convergence toward the
invariant measure of a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) after a
suitable renormalization. Finally, ergodic properties of this PDMP are given in
the multi-armed case.

campaigns in the optical-IR band.
  We monitored the field of the Swift GRB 130702A (redshift z = 0.145) using
the 8.2-m VLT, the 3.6-m TNG and the 0.6-m REM telescopes during the time
interval between 4 and 40 days after the burst. Photometric and spectroscopic
observations revealed the presence of the associated Type Ic SN 2013dx. Our
multi-band photometry allowed the construction of a bolometric light curve.}
  The bolometric light curve of SN 2013dx resembles that of 2003dh (associated
with GRB 030329), but is ~10% faster and ~25% dimmer. From this we infer a
synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.2 solar masses. The multi-epoch optical
spectroscopy shows that the SN 2013dx behavior is best matched by SN 1998bw,
among the other well-known low-redshift SNe associated with GRBs and XRFs, and
by SN 2010ah, an energetic Type Ic SN not associated with any GRB. The
photospheric velocity of the ejected material declines from ~2.7X10^4 km/s at 8
rest frame days from the explosion, to ~3.5X10^3 km/s at 40 days. These values
are extremely close to those of SN1998bw and 2010ah. We deduce for SN 2013dx a
kinetic energy of ~35X10^51 erg, and an ejected mass of ~7 solar masses. This
suggests that the progenitor of SN2013dx had a mass of ~25 solar masses, i.e.,
15-20% less massive than that of SN 1998bw.
  Finally, we performed a study of the SN 2013dx environment, through
spectroscopy of the closeby galaxies. 9 out of the 14 inspected galaxies lie
within 0.03 in redshift from z=0.145, indicating that the host of GRB
130702A/SN 2013dx belongs to a group of galaxies, an unprecedented finding for
a GRB-associated SN and, to our knowledge, for long GRBs in general.

Dirac cones at two distinct energies and nontrivial flat bands and, in the

electronic gaps opened in the valence band by the spin-orbit coupling and the
quantum confinement in the honeycomb geometry. The lowest Dirac conduction band
has S-orbital character and is equivalent to the pi-pi* band of graphene but

their P-orbital character. We show that the width of the Dirac bands varies

the range of the interparticle interactions on the fragmentation degree of one-

of the system using the recursive implementation of the multiconfigurational
time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, R-MCTDHB. The dependence of the
degree of fragmentation on dimensionality, particle number, areal or line
density and interaction strength is assessed. It is found that for contact
interactions, the fragmentation is essentially density independent in two
dimensions. However, fragmentation increasingly depends on density the more
long-ranged the interactions become. The degree of fragmentation is increasing,
keeping the particle number $N$ fixed, when the density is decreasing as
expected in one spatial dimension. We demonstrate that this remains,
nontrivially, true also for long-range interactions in two spatial dimensions.
We, finally, find that within our fully self-consistent approach, the
fragmentation degree, to a good approximation, decreases universally as
$N^{-1/2}$ when only $N$ is varied.

Schrodinger equation (DNLSE). The dynamical phase diagram of the system is
obtained using the variational method. The dynamical evolution shows very

soliton line approaches the critical line in the phase diagram. When weak
two-body interactions are reintroduced into this regime, the discrete breather
solutions reappear, but occupies a very small domain in the phase space.

Galaxy, remains enigmatic. Testing the theory of a past active period of Sgr A*
requires X-ray polarimetry. In this paper, we show how modern imaging
polarimeters could revolutionize our understanding of the Galactic Center.
Through Monte Carlo modeling, we produce a 4-8 keV polarization map of the
Galactic Center, focusing on the polarimetric signature produced by Sgr B1, Sgr
B2, G0.11-0.11, Bridge E, Bridge D, Bridge B2, MC2, MC1, Sgr C3, Sgr C2, and
Sgr C1. We estimate the resulting polarization, include polarized flux dilution
by the diffuse plasma emission detected toward the GC, and simulate the
polarization map that modern polarimetric detectors would obtain assuming the
performances of a mission prototype. The eleven reflection nebulae investigated
in this paper present a variety of polarization signatures, ranging from nearly
unpolarized to highly polarized (about 77%) fluxes. A major improvement in our
simulation is the addition of a diffuse, unpolarized plasma emission that
strongly impacts soft X-ray polarized fluxes. The dilution factor is in the
range 50% - 70%, making the observation of the Bridge structure unlikely even
in the context of modern polarimetry. The best targets are the Sgr B and Sgr C
complexes, and the G0.11-0.11 cloud. An exploratory observation of a few
hundred kilo-seconds of the Sgr B complex would allow a significant detection
of the polarization and be sufficient to derive hints on the primary source of
radiation. A more ambitious program (few Ms) of mapping the giant molecular
clouds could then be carried out to probe with great precision the turbulent
history of Sgr A*, and place important constraints on the composition and
three-dimensional position of the surrounding gas.

behaviour of sequences modulo 1. In particular, by using ergodic and dynamical
methods, a new insight to problems concerning the asymptotic behaviour of
multidimensional sequences can be given, and a criterion to construct new
multidimensional uniformly distributed sequences is provided. The starting
point to do this, is to look at the orbit, i.e. the sequence of iterates, of a
uniquely ergodic transformation T defined on [0,1]. The unique ergodicity of
the transformation has the following consequence: the orbit of x under T is a
uniformly distributed sequence. We devoted the first chapter entirely on
classical topics in uniform distribution theory (UDT) and ergodic theory. This
provides the basic requirements for a complete understanding of the following
chapters, even to a reader who is not familiar with the subject. Chapter 2
deals with the LS-sequences of points. In Chapter 3, the method used to
construct the transformation T is the so-called cutting-stacking technique. In
particular, we were able to prove the ergodicity of T and that the orbit of the
origin under this map coincides with an LS-sequence which turns out to be a
low-discrepancy one. In Chapter 4, another approach from ergodic theory is
used. This approach is based on the study of dynamical systems arising from
numeration systems defined by linear recurrences. In this way we could not only
prove that the transformation T defined in Chapter 3 is uniquely ergodic, but
we could also construct multidimensional uniformly distributed sequences. In
Chapter 5 we found bounds for integrals of two-dimensional, piecewise constant
functions with respect to copulas. To solve this problem, we drew a connection
to linear assignment problems. The approximation technique was applied to
problems in financial mathematics and UDT.

Continuous Spontaneous Localization model (CSL), in the cosmological context,
might be used to provide a solution to the mentioned issues by considering a
dynamical reduction of the wave function. The CSL model has been applied to the
inflationary universe before and different conclusions have been obtained. In
this letter, we use a different approach to implement the CSL model during

quantum-to-classical transition, we use the CSL model to generate the
primordial perturbations, that is, the dynamical evolution provided by the CSL
model is responsible for the transition from a homogeneous and isotropic
initial state to a final one lacking such symmetries. Our approach leads to
results that can be clearly distinguished from preceding works. Specifically,
the scalar and tensor power spectra are not time-dependent, and retains the
amplification mechanism of the CSL model. Moreover, our framework depends only
on one parameter (the CSL parameter) and its value is consistent with
cosmological and laboratory observations.

  The TM programming paradigm emerged as an alternative to conventional

the inherent issues of lock-based synchronization behind a nice transactional

of inherent cost of \emph{read validation} in TMs. We then show that the total

orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), which is very successful in mobile
communications for its low complexity and high performance, has already been
investigated for backscatter RFID. On the other hand, a recently proposed
scheme called unitary query was shown to be able to considerably improve the
reliability of backscatter radio by exploiting query diversity. Therefore
incorporating the classical OSTBC (at the tag end) with the recently proposed
unitary query (at the query end) seems to be promising. However, in this paper,
we show that simple, direct employment of OSTBC together with unitary query
incurs a linear decoding problem and eventually leads to a severe performance
degradation. As a re-design of the recently proposed unitary query and the
classical OSTBC specifically for MIMO backscatter RFID, we present a
BUTQ-mOSTBC design pair idea by proposing the block-level unitary query (BUTQ)
at the query end and the corresponding modified OSTBC (mOSTBC) at the tag end.
The proposed BUTQ-mOSTBC can resolve the linear decoding problem, keep the

strongly dominant across language pairs. Instead, the choice of the optimal
approach for a new translation task still seems to be mostly driven by
empirical trials. To orientate the reader in this vast and complex research
area, we present a comprehensive survey of word reordering viewed as a
statistical modeling challenge and as a natural language phenomenon. The survey
describes in detail how word reordering is modeled within different
string-based and tree-based SMT frameworks and as a stand-alone task, including
systematic overviews of the literature in advanced reordering modeling. We then
question why some approaches are more successful than others in different
language pairs. We argue that, besides measuring the amount of reordering, it
is important to understand which kinds of reordering occur in a given language
pair. To this end, we conduct a qualitative analysis of word reordering
phenomena in a diverse sample of language pairs, based on a large collection of
linguistic knowledge. Empirical results in the SMT literature are shown to
support the hypothesis that a few linguistic facts can be very useful to
anticipate the reordering characteristics of a language pair and to select the
SMT framework that best suits them.

makers in enhancing their decisions. This paper aims at designing a new
multi-layer framework that can support the process of performing decisions from
the obtained beliefs using information fusion. Since it is not an easy task to
cross the gap between computed beliefs of certain hypothesis and decisions, the
proposed framework consists of the following layers in order to provide a
suitable architecture (ordered bottom up): 1. A layer for combination of basic
belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits
Dezert-Smarandache Theory, DSmT, and proportional conflict redistribution to
provide more realistic final beliefs. 2. A layer for computation of pignistic
probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final
beliefs. 3. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian
network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic
probability. 4. Ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support
decision making. A case study has been accomplished at various operational
conditions in order to prove the concept, in addition it pointed out that: 1.
The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs
but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions. 2.
Exploiting the pignistic probability for the integration of the information
fusion with the Bayesian network provides probabilistic inference and enable
decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the
underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding
reasons. A comparative study of the proposed framework with respect to other
information fusion systems confirms its superiority to support decision making.

seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses in the nondegenerate case where the
triplet scalars of various charge ($H^{\pm\pm}, H^\pm, H^0, A^0$) have
different masses. Compared with the degenerate case, the cascade decays of
scalars lead to many new, interesting signal channels. In the positive scenario
where $M_{H^{\pm\pm}}<M_{H^\pm}<M_{H^0/A^0}$, the four-lepton signal is still
the most promising discovery channel for the doubly-charged scalars
$H^{\pm\pm}$. The five-lepton signal is crucial to probe the mass spectrum of
the scalars, for which, for example, a $5\sigma$ reach at 14 TeV LHC for
$M_{H^{\pm}}=430 GeV$ with $M_{H^{\pm\pm}}=400 GeV$ requires an integrated
luminosity of 76/fb. And the six-lepton signal can be used to probe the neutral
scalars $H^0/A^0$, which are usually hard to detect in the degenerate case. In
the negative scenario where $M_{H^{\pm\pm}}>M_{H^\pm}>M_{H^0/A^0}$, the
detection of $H^{\pm\pm}$ is more challenging, when the cascade decay
$H^{\pm\pm}\to H^{\pm}W^{\pm*}$ is dominant. The most important channel is the
associated $H^{\pm}H^0/A^0$ production in the final state
$\ell^\pm\cancel{E}_Tb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, which requires a luminosity of 109/fb
for a $5\sigma$ discovery, while the final state
$\ell^\pm\cancel{E}_Tb\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ is less promising. Moreover, the
associated $H^0A^0$ production can give same signals as the standard model
Higgs pair production. With a much larger cross section, the $H^0A^0$
production in the final state $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ could reach $3\sigma$
significance at 14 TeV LHC with a luminosity of 300/fb. In summary, with an
integrated luminosity of order 500/fb, the triplet scalars can be fully
reconstructed at 14 TeV LHC in the negative scenario.

the scenario where the camera motion is dominant and the scene dynamics are

various aggregation methods and their combinations. We compare the proposed

portfolios, hard to reconcile by some standard credit portfolio models. We show
the Jungle model can handle inhomogeneous portfolios with state-dependent

ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision is the bottom-up thermalization scenario,
which describes the dynamics of the system shortly after the collision via the
decay of originally produced hard gluons to soft ones through QCD branching
processes. The soft gluons form a thermal bath that subsequently reaches
thermalization and/or equilibration. There is a scaling solution to the
bottom-up problem that interpolates between its early stage, which has a highly
anisotropic gluon distribution, and its final stage of equilibration which
occurs later. Such a solution depends on a single parameter, the so called
momentum asymmetry parameter $\delta$. With this scaling solution, the
bottom-up scenario gets modified and the evolving parton system, referred to as
the $m$'bottom-up parton system throughout this paper, is described by this
modification. The time evolution of the system in the original bottom-up ansatz
is driven by the saturation scale, $Q_{s}$. However, for the $m$'bottom-up we
generalize the ansatz of the evolution by introducing two additional momentum
scales, which give a thermalization time and temperature of the soft gluon bath
somewhat different from those obtained when the $m$'bottom-up matches onto the
final stage of the original bottom-up scenario.

"1605.04166","Promita Chakraborty","Promita Chakraborty","PeppyChains: Simplifying the assembly of 3D-printed generic protein
  models",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peppytides is a coarse-grained, accurate, physical model of the polypeptide
chain. I have shared instructions to make your own polypeptide chain and STL
files of Peppytides in MAKE magazine in Jan 2014 issue. However, Peppytides
involves a lot of steps and assembly of units. People were asking me, 'Is there
any easier way to make these models?'. I have been at several workshops,
hands-on sessions, talks and a science events with Peppytides. From the
feedback that I got everywhere, most of the makers, teachers and students want
something that is 3D-Print-&-Go, or at least easier to make, even at the cost
of some features.
  I have designed a new version of the model, named PeppyChains, in which the
backbone chain of the model can be 3d-printed as a single unit. PeppyChains
design eliminates the assembling of parts to form the backbone chain, but with
the cost of losing the ability to use bias-magnets to favor certain phi/psi
angles in the backbone. I have been demonstrating PeppyChains at various talks
and workshops along with Peppytides, and I have received requests for making
the STL file public. On popular demand, here I am sharing this STL and
providing the step-by-step instructions to make PeppyChains. Just add the
hydrogen-bond magnets, paint and color-code the atoms, and you are ready to go!
No drilling. No time consuming assembly.
