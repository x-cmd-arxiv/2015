and which carry the highest risk of causing a major outbreak if they are the
source of the infection? Here we show how these questions can be answered to
good approximation using the cavity method. Several curious properties of node
vulnerability and risk are explored: some nodes are more vulnerable than others
to weaker infections, yet less vulnerable to stronger ones; a node is always
more likely to be caught in an outbreak than it is to start one, except when
the disease has a deterministic lifetime; the rank order of node risk depends
on the details of the distribution of infectious periods.

tightly bound valley excitons. The strong interaction of excitons with
long-range electromagnetic fields in these 2D systems can significantly affect

measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a
given portfolio, time horizon, and probability $\alpha$, the $100\alpha\%$ VaR
is defined as a threshold loss value, such that the probability that the loss
on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value is $\alpha$.
That is to say, it is a quantile of the distribution of the losses, which has
both good analytic properties and easy interpretation as a risk measure.
However, its extension to the multivariate framework is not unique because a
unique definition of multivariate quantile does not exist. In the current
literature, the multivariate quantiles are related to a specific partial order
considered in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, or to a property of the univariate quantile
that is desirable to be extended to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this work, we
introduce a multivariate value at risk as a vector-valued directional risk
measure, based on a directional multivariate quantile, which has recently been
introduced in the literature. The directional approach allows the manager to
consider external information or risk preferences in her/his analysis. We have
derived some properties of the risk measure and we have compared the univariate
\textit{VaR} over the marginals with the components of the directional
multivariate VaR. We have also analyzed the relationship between some families
of copulas, for which it is possible to obtain closed forms of the multivariate
VaR that we propose. Finally, comparisons with other alternative multivariate
VaR given in the literature, are provided in terms of robustness.

molecules in collisions of muonic p\mu\ atoms with hydrogen. In measurements of
the basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the
pseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular
states. Thus knowledge of \lambda_pp\mu\ is required for a correct
interpretation of these experiments.
  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate
\Lambda_S from the singlet p\mu\ atom, employing a low density active target to
suppress pp\mu\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the
unprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge
in \lambda_pp\mu\ had to be improved.
  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon
disappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm
of argon, a competing process to pp\mu\ formation was introduced, which allowed
the extraction of \lambda_pp\mu\ from the observed time distribution of decay
electrons.
  Results: The pp\mu\ formation rate was measured as \lambda_pp\mu = (2.01 +-
0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \lambda_pp\mu\
value used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.
  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and
the fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to
the main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \lambda_pp\mu\ to a
minor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \Lambda_S and g_P, as
determined in MuCap. Our final value for \lambda_pp\mu\ shifts \Lambda_S and
g_P by less than one tenth of their respective uncertainties compared to our
results published earlier.

shortcoming, D. Sudarsky and collaborators have developed a proposal: the
self-induced collapse hypothesis. In this scheme, the objective collapse of the
inflaton wave function is responsible for the emergence of inhomogeneity and
anisotropy at all scales. In previous papers, the proposal was developed with
an almost exact de Sitter space-time approximation for the background that led
to a perfect scale-invariant power spectrum. In the present article, we
consider a full quasi-de Sitter expansion and calculate the primordial power
spectrum for three different choices of the self-induced collapse. The
consideration of a quasi-de Sitter background allow us to distinguish
departures from an exact scale-invariant power spectrum that are due to the
inclusion of the collapse hypothesis. These deviations are also different from
the prediction of standard inflationary models with running spectral index.
Comparison with the primordial power spectrum and the CMB temperature
fluctuation spectrum preferred by the latest observational data is also
discussed. From the analysis performed in this work, it follows that most of
the collapse schemes analysed in this paper are viable candidates to explain

of dust grains in the interstellar medium (ISM). Calculations of the dust
destruction timescale have so far been carried out using plane parallel steady
shocks, however that approximation breaks down when the destruction timescale
becomes longer than that for the evolution of the supernova remnant (SNR)
shock. In this paper we present new calculations of grain destruction in
evolving, radiative SNRs. To facilitate comparison with the previous study by
Jones et al. (1996), we adopt the same dust properties as in that paper. We
find that the efficiencies of grain destruction are most divergent from those
for a steady shock when the thermal history of a shocked gas parcel in the SNR
differs significantly from that behind a steady shock. This occurs in shocks
with velocities >~ 200 km/s for which the remnant is just beginning to go
radiative. Assuming SNRs evolve in a warm phase dominated ISM, we find dust
destruction timescales are increased by a factor of ~2 compared to those of
Jones et al. (1996), who assumed a hot gas dominated ISM. Recent estimates of
supernova rates and ISM mass lead to another factor of ~3 increase in the
destruction timescales, resulting in a silicate grain destruction timescale of
~2-3 Gyr. These increases, while not able resolve the problem of the discrepant
timescales for silicate grain destruction and creation, are an important step
towards understanding the origin, and evolution of dust in the ISM.

studies of inflation and one in the context of dark energy. The first study
involves two noncanonical kinetic terms each in a two-field scenario, and their
effects on the generation of isocurvature modes. As a result, these terms
affect the isocurvature perturbations produced, and consequently the Cosmic
Microwave Background. In the following study, the impact of a sharp transition
upon the effective Planck mass is considered in both a single-field and
two-field model. A feature in the primordial power spectrum arising from these
transitions is found in single-field models, but not for two-field models. The
final model discussed is on the subject of dark energy. A type of nonconformal
coupling is examined namely the ""disformal"" coupling; in this scenario a scalar
field is disformally coupled to matter species. Two consistency checks are
undertaken, the first to provide a fluid description and the second, a kinetic
theory. From this, observables are constructed and used to create constraints
on the individual coupling strengths.

gamma-ray data both have found two close periodicities P1(GBI) = 26.49 \pm 0.07
d, P2(GBI)=26.92 \pm 0.07 d and P1(gamma)=26.48 \pm 0.08 d, P2(gamma) = 26.99
\pm 0.08 d. Aims: The system LSI+61303 is the object of several continuous
monitoring programs at low and high energies. The frequency difference between
f1 and f2 of only 0.0006 d(-1) requires long-term monitoring because the
frequency resolution in timing analysis is related to the inverse of the
overall time interval. The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) 40 m telescope
has been monitoring the source at 15 GHz for five years and overlaps with
Fermi-LAT monitoring. The aim of this work is to establish whether the two
frequencies are also resolved in the OVRO monitoring. Methods: We analysed OVRO
data with the Lomb-Scargle method. We also updated the timing analysis of
Fermi-LAT observations. Results: The periodograms of OVRO data confirm the two
periodicities P1(OVRO) = 26.5 \pm 0.1 d and P2(OVRO) = 26.9 \pm 0.1 d.
Conclusions: The three indipendent measurements of P1 and P2 with GBI, OVRO,
and Fermi-LAT observations confirm that the periodicities are permanent
features of the system LSI+61303. The similar behaviours of the emission at
high (GeV) and low (radio) energy when the compact object in LSI+61303 is
toward apastron suggest that the emission is caused by the same periodically
(P1) ejected population of electrons in a precessing (P2) jet.

reconnection processes or through shocks driven by coronal mass ejections
(CMEs), is still under scrutiny despite decades of research. The measured
properties of solar energetic particles (SEPs) have long been modeled in
different particle-acceleration scenarios. The challenge has been to
disentangle to the effects of transport from those of acceleration. The Payload
for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA)
instrument, enables unique observations of SEPs including composition and the
angular distribution of the particles about the magnetic field, i.e. pitch
angle distribution, over a broad energy range (>80 MeV) -- bridging a critical
gap between space-based measurements and ground-based. We present high-energy
SEP data from PAMELA acquired during the 2012 May 17 SEP event. These data
exhibit differential anisotropies and thus transport features over the
instrument rigidity range. SEP protons exhibit two distinct pitch angle
distributions; a low-energy population that extends to 90{\deg} and a
population that is beamed at high energies (>1 GeV), consistent with neutron
monitor measurements. To explain a low-energy SEP population that exhibits
significant scattering or redistribution accompanied by a high-energy
population that reaches the Earth relatively unaffected by dispersive transport
effects, we postulate that the scattering or redistribution takes place
locally. We believe these are the first comprehensive measurements of the
effects of solar energetic particle transport in the Earth's magnetosheath.

three space-time dimensions. We mention an apparent problem in the matching of
such operators in dualities between non-supersymmetric theories, and suggest a
possible resolution. A similar apparent problem exists in the mapping of chiral
monopole operators in theories with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry. We show that in
many theories the lowest naive chiral monopole operator is actually not chiral,
and we find the lowest monopole operator that is actually chiral in these
theories. It turns out that there are several different forms of this operator,
depending on the number of colors, the number of flavours, and the Chern-Simons
level. Since we use the supersymmetric index to find the lowest chiral
monopoles, our results for these monopoles are guaranteed to be invariant under
the dualities in supersymmetric theories. The theories we discuss are believed
to be dual in the 't~Hooft large $N_c$ limit to classical high-spin gravity
theories. We argue that these theories (supersymmetric or not) should not have
classical solutions charged under the $U(1)$ gauge field in the high-spin

resulting points on the Grassmannian have representations as orthonormal

are a variety of metrics which allow us to determine a distance matrices that
can be used to realize the Grassmannian as an embedding in Euclidean space. We
illustrate that we can achieve an approximately isometric embedding of the
Grassmann manifold using the chordal metric while this is not the case with
geodesic distances. However, non-isometric embeddings generated by using a
pseudometric on the Grassmannian lead to the best classification results. We
observe that as the dimension of the Grassmannian grows, the accuracy of the
classification grows to 100% on two illustrative examples. We also observe a
decrease in classification rates if the dimension of the points on the
Grassmannian is too large for the dimension of the Euclidean space. We use
sparse support vector machines to perform additional model reduction. The
resulting classifier selects a subset of dimensions of the embedding without
loss in classification performance.

  result to all regular distributions",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the design and analysis of revenue-maximizing auctions, auction
performance is typically measured with respect to a prior distribution over
inputs. The most obvious source for such a distribution is past data. The goal
is to understand how much data is necessary and sufficient to guarantee
near-optimal expected revenue.
  Our basic model is a single-item auction in which bidders' valuations are
drawn independently from unknown and non-identical distributions. The seller is
given $m$ samples from each of these distributions ""for free"" and chooses an
auction to run on a fresh sample. How large does m need to be, as a function of
the number k of bidders and eps > 0, so that a (1 - eps)-approximation of the
optimal revenue is achievable?
  We prove that, under standard tail conditions on the underlying
distributions, m = poly(k, 1/eps) samples are necessary and sufficient. Our
lower bound stands in contrast to many recent results on simple and
prior-independent auctions and fundamentally involves the interplay between
bidder competition, non-identical distributions, and a very close (but still
constant) approximation of the optimal revenue. It effectively shows that the
only way to achieve a sufficiently good constant approximation of the optimal
revenue is through a detailed understanding of bidders' valuation
distributions. Our upper bound is constructive and applies in particular to a
variant of the empirical Myerson auction, the natural auction that runs the
revenue-maximizing auction with respect to the empirical distributions of the
samples.
  Our sample complexity lower bound depends on the set of allowable
distributions, and to capture this we introduce alpha-strongly regular
distributions, which interpolate between the well-studied classes of regular
(alpha = 0) and MHR (alpha = 1) distributions. We give evidence that this
definition is of independent interest.

Equivalence Principle (EEP) suffices to ensure that gravity can be understood

verification, with present day tests reaching the regime where quantum
mechanics becomes relevant. Here we show that the classical formulation of the
EEP does not apply in such a regime. The EEP requires equivalence between the
total rest mass-energy of a system, the mass-energy that constitutes its
inertia, and the mass-energy that constitutes its weight. In quantum mechanics
internal energy is given by a Hamiltonian operator describing dynamics of
internal degrees of freedom. We therefore introduce a quantum formulation of
the EEP -- equivalence between the rest, inertial and gravitational internal
energy operators. We show that the validity of the classical EEP does not imply
the validity of its quantum formulation, which thus requires an independent
experimental verification. We reanalyse some already completed experiments with
respect to the quantum EEP and discuss to which extent they allow testing its
various aspects.

implementation choices that, while common at the time, are now seen to limit
its utility with modern data. The authors of the FITS standard could not
anticipate the challenges which we are facing today in astronomical computing.
Difficulties we now face include, but are not limited to, addressing the need
to handle an expanded range of specialized data product types (data models),
being more conducive to the networked exchange and storage of data, handling
very large datasets, and capturing significantly more complex metadata and data
relationships.
  There are members of the community today who find some or all of these
limitations unworkable, and have decided to move ahead with storing data in
other formats. If this fragmentation continues, we risk abandoning the
advantages of broad interoperability, and ready archivability, that the FITS
format provides for astronomy. In this paper we detail some selected important
problems which exist within the FITS standard today. These problems may provide
insight into deeper underlying issues which reside in the format and we provide
a discussion of some lessons learned. It is not our intention here to prescribe
specific remedies to these issues; rather, it is to call attention of the FITS
and greater astronomical computing communities to these problems in the hope
that it will spur action to address them.

chosen metrics. Models show overall a modest skill in suggesting right timings
of the monsoon onset while the RFA slope is generally underestimated. One third
of models fail to capture the monsoon signal over the Indus basin. Mostly, SI
estimates for WPR are simulated higher than observed for all basins, while for
MPR, it is simulated higher (lower) for Ganges and Brahmaputra (Indus and

In the current study we focus on providing a clear and general overview of this
production mechanism. For the first time we study all regimes possible on the
level of momentum distribution functions, which we obtain by solving a system
of Boltzmann equations. These quantities contain the full information about the
production process, which allows us to not only track the evolution of the DM
generation but to also take into account all bounds related to the spectrum,
such as constraints from structure formation or from avoiding too much dark
radiation. In particular we show that this simple production mechanism can,
depending on the regime, lead to strongly non-thermal DM spectra which may even
feature more than one peak in the momentum distribution. These cases could have
particularly interesting consequences for cosmological structure formation, as
their analysis requires more refined tools than the simplistic estimate using
the free-streaming horizon. Here we present the mechanism including all
concepts and subtleties involved, for now using the assumption that the
effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom is constant during DM
production, which is applicable in a significant fraction of the parameter
space. This allows us to derive analytical results to back up our detailed
numerical computations, thus leading to the most comprehensive picture of keV
sterile neutrino DM production by singlet scalar decays that exists up to now.

distribution, $dN/dM \propto M^{-2.39 \pm 0.03}$, is steeper than that for GMCs
in the inner Milky Way, but comparable to that found in some late-type

contradiction to the expectation from Larson's relation. In general, the GMCs
in NGC4526 are more luminous, denser, and have a higher velocity dispersion
than equal size GMCs in the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group.
These may be due to higher interstellar radiation field than in the Milky Way
disk and weaker external pressure than in the Galactic center. In addition, a
kinematic measurement of cloud rotation shows that the rotation is driven by
the galactic shear. For the vast majority of the clouds, the rotational energy
is less than the turbulent and gravitational energy, while the four innermost
clouds are unbound and will likely be torn apart by the strong shear at the
galactic center. We combine our data with the archival data of other galaxies
to show that the surface density $\Sigma$ of GMCs is not approximately constant
as previously believed, but varies by $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude. We also
show that the size and velocity dispersion of GMC population across galaxies

blazars from 2008 - 2013 using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope
System (SMARTS), with supplemental spectroscopy and polarization data from the
Steward Observatory. We find that the emission lines are much less variable
than the continuum; 4 of 7 blazars had no detectable emission line variability
over the 5 years. This is consistent with photoionization primarily by an
accretion disk, allowing us to use the lines as a probe of disk activity.
Comparing optical emission line flux with Fermi $\gamma$-ray flux and optical
polarized flux, we investigate whether relativistic jet variability is related
to the accretion flow. In general, we see no such dependence, suggesting the
jet variability is likely caused by internal processes like turbulence or shock
acceleration rather than a variable accretion rate. However, three sources
showed statistically significant emission line flares in close temporal
proximity to very large Fermi $\gamma$-ray flares. While we do not have
sufficient emission line data to quantitatively assess their correlation with
the $\gamma$-ray flux, it appears that in some cases, the jet might provide
additional photoionizing flux to the broad line region, which implies some
gamma-rays are produced within the broad line region, at least for these large
flares.

Shocks and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible

grounds. We show that shock models are unlikely to account for the jet

typically do not accelerate particles far beyond the thermal energy, and vice
versa. In contrast, we show that magnetic reconnection can deposit more than
50% of the dissipated energy into non-thermal leptons as long as the energy
density of the magnetic field in the bulk flow is larger than the rest mass

important tracers of the diffuse neutral interstellar medium. Radio
astronomical observations of this transition, using either a single dish
telescope or an array interferometer, reveal different properties of the
interstellar medium. Such observations are particularly useful to study the
multiphase nature and turbulence in the interstellar gas. Observations with
multiple radio telescopes have recently been used to study these two closely
related aspects in greater detail. Using various observational techniques, the
density and the velocity fluctuations in the Galactic interstellar medium was
found to have a Kolmogorov-like power law power spectra. The observed power law
scaling of the turbulent velocity dispersion with the length scale can be used
to derive the true temperature distribution of the medium. Observations from a
large ongoing atomic hydrogen absorption line survey have also been used to
study the distribution of gas at different temperature. The thermal steady
state model predicts that the multiphase neutral gas will exist in cold and
warm phase with temperature below 200 K and above 5000 K respectively. However,
these observations clearly show the presence of a large fraction of gas in the
intermediate unstable phase. These results raise serious doubt about the
validity of the standard model, and highlight the necessity of alternative
theoretical models. Interestingly, numerical simulations suggest that some of
the observational results can be explained consistently by including the
effects of turbulence in the models of the multiphase medium. This review
article presents a brief outline of some of the basic ideas of radio
astronomical observations and data analysis, summarizes the results from recent
observations, and discusses possible implications of the results.

the galaxy stellar-mass distribution. We find our sample is consistent with no
evolution in the M_BH-M_* relation from z~2 to z~0. BLAGNs and their host
galaxies which lie off the black hole mass galaxy total stellar mass relation
tend to have evolutionary vectors anti-correlated with their mass ratios: that
is, galaxies with over-massive (under-massive) black holes tend to have a low
(high) ratio of the specific accretion rate to the specific star formation
rate. We also use the measured growth rates to estimate the preferred AGN duty
cycle for our galaxies to evolve most consistently onto the local M_BH-M_Bul

formation histories, the data suggest a non-evolving (no more than a factor of
a few) BLAGN duty cycle among star-forming galaxies of 10% (1sigma range of

these observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. Reciprocity
failure is known to exist in HgCdTe devices and a correction for this effect
has already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. However
observations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. Here instead, we
provide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. This
is obtained via inter-calibration of NIC2 F110W/F160W with WFC3 in the low
count-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.
These objects have relatively simple near-IR SEDs, uniform colors, and their
extended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate than
would stars. The use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on PSF
profiles. We find ST magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the NICMOS
cooling system, NCS) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for F110W and 25.803 +- 0.023 for
F160W, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates
1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799). Before the installation of the NCS, we

with the high-count-rate calibration (24.815 and 25.470). We also check the
standard bandpasses of WFC3 and NICMOS 2 using a range of stars and galaxies at
different colors and find mild tension for WFC3, limiting the accuracy of the
zeropoints. To avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was ""blinded"" in that
the fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.

driving galaxy evolution and in our efforts to understand it. However,
different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope and
shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection
criteria adopted to isolate star-forming galaxies, that may include or exclude
galaxies with specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS
value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an
objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of
star-forming galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-Mass-Number plot, the MS is then
defined as the ridge line of the star-forming peak, as illustrated with various
figures. The advantages of such definition are manifold. If generally adopted
it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using
the same star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass diagnostics, or to
highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All this could
help understanding MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium
and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching
galaxies.

host galaxies have a higher overall percentage of bars (51.8%) than inactive
galaxies exhibiting central star formation (37.1%). This difference is
primarily due to known effects; that the presence of both AGN and galactic bars
is strongly correlated with both the stellar mass and integrated colour of the
host galaxy. We control for this effect by examining the difference in AGN
fraction between barred and unbarred galaxies in fixed bins of mass and colour.
Once this effect is accounted for, there remains a small but statistically
significant increase that represents 16% of the average barred AGN fraction.
Using the $L_{\rm{[O III]}}/M_{BH} $ratio as a measure of AGN strength, we show
that barred AGN do not exhibit stronger accretion than unbarred AGN at a fixed

broad-line quasars at 0.1<z<1 (46 at z>0.6) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. High signal-to-noise ratio coadded
spectra (average S/N~30 per 69 km/s pixel) from SDSS-RM allowed decomposition
of the host and quasar spectra, and measurement of the host stellar velocity
dispersions and black hole (BH) masses using the single-epoch (SE) virial
method. The large sample size and dynamic range in luminosity
(L5100=10^(43.2-44.7) erg/s) lead to the first clear detection of a correlation
between SE virial BH mass and host stellar velocity dispersion far beyond the
local universe. However, the observed correlation is significantly flatter than
the local relation, suggesting that there are selection biases in high-z
luminosity-threshold quasar samples for such studies. Our uniform sample and
analysis enable an investigation of the redshift evolution of the M-sigma
relation free of caveats by comparing different samples/analyses at disjoint
redshifts. We do not observe evolution of the M-sigma relation in our sample,
up to z~1, but there is an indication that the relation flattens towards higher
redshifts. Coupled with the increasing threshold luminosity with redshift in
our sample, this again suggests certain selection biases are at work, and
simple simulations demonstrate that a constant M-sigma relation is favored to
z~1. Our results highlight the scientific potential of deep coadded
spectroscopy from quasar monitoring programs, and offer a new path to probe the
co-evolution of BHs and galaxies at earlier times.

a S=1/2 honeycomb lattice magnet in which a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic
exchange J (favoring N\'eel order) competes with two different multi-spin
interaction terms: a six-spin interaction Q_3 that favors columnar valence-bond
solid (VBS) order, and a four-spin interaction Q_2 that favors staggered VBS
order. For Q_3 ~ Q_2 >> J, we establish that the competition between the two
different VBS orders stabilizes N\'eel order in a large swathe of the phase
diagram even when J is the smallest energy-scale in the Hamiltonian. When Q_3
>> (Q_2,J) (Q_2 >> (Q_3,J)), this model exhibits at zero temperature phase
transition from the N\'eel state to a columnar (staggered) VBS state. We
establish that the N\'eel-columnar VBS transition is continuous for all values
of Q_2, and that critical properties along the entire phase boundary are
well-characterized by critical exponents and amplitudes of the non-compact CP^1
(NCCP^1) theory of deconfined criticality, similar to what is observed on a
square lattice. However, a surprising three-fold anisotropy of the phase of the
VBS order parameter at criticality, whose presence was recently noted at the
Q_2=0 deconfined critical point, is seen to persist all along this phase
boundary. We use a classical analogy to explore this by studying the critical
point of a three-dimensional XY model with a four-fold anisotropy field which
is known to be weakly irrelevant at the three-dimensional XY critical point. In
this case, we again find that the critical anisotropy appears to saturate to a
nonzero value over the range of sizes accessible to our simulations.

For the ferromagnetic Mott insulator, the Gutzwiller mean-field theory only
yields particle-hole like modes but no Goldstone mode associated with long
range spin order. To overcome this limitation, we supplement the Gutzwiller
theory with a Schwinger boson mean-field theory which captures super-exchange
driven fluctuations. In addition to the gapped particle-hole-like modes, we
obtain a gapless quadratically dispersing ferromagnetic spin-wave Goldstone

effective mass of the ferromagnetic Goldstone mode as the superfluid-Mott phase

more than a factor of 500 within a propagation distance of one wavelength. The
diffusion equation, which describes the temperature as a function of space and
time, is linear. For every linear equation the superposition principle is
valid, which is known as Huygens principle for optical or mechanical wave
fields. This limits the spatial resolution, like the Abbe diffraction limit in
optics. The resolution is the minimal size of a structure which can be detected
at a certain depth. If an embedded structure at a certain depth in a sample is
suddenly heated, e.g. by eddy current or absorbed light, an image of the
structure can be reconstructed from the measured temperature at the sample
surface. To get the resolution the image reconstruction can be considered as
the time reversal of the thermal wave. This inverse problem is ill-conditioned
and therefore regularization methods have to be used taking additional
assumptions like smoothness of the solutions into account. In the present work
for the first time methods of non-equilibrium statistical physics are used to
solve this inverse problem without the need of such additional assumptions and
without the necessity to choose a regularization parameter. For reconstructing
such an embedded structure by thermal waves the resolution turns out to be
proportional to the depth and inversely proportional to the natural logarithm
of the signal-to-noise ratio. This result could be derived from the diffusion
equation by using a delta-source at a certain depth and setting the entropy
production caused by thermal diffusion equal to the information loss. No
specific model about the stochastic process of the fluctuations and about the
distribution densities around the mean values was necessary to get this result.

Higgs couplings lead to vacuum instability of the Higgs potential. Above the
scale of vacuum instability, bosonic states must stabilize the potential,
implying a cut-off to the pure fermion model. Conservatively tuning the models
to produce the maximal cut-off for a given Higgs coupling effect, we show that
observing a deviation in the $Htt$, $H$-diphoton, or $H$-digluon coupling,
larger than 20$%$, would require that new bosons exist in order to stabilize
the Higgs potential below about 100 TeV. For generic parameter configurations,
and unless the new fermions are made as light as they can possibly be given
current experimental constraints, observing a 10$%$ deviation in any of these
couplings would suggest an instability cut-off below 10-100 TeV. Similarly, if
new bosons are absent up to a high scale, then a deviation in the $Hbb$ or
$H\tau\tau$ coupling, larger than about 20$%$, should be accompanied by a
sizable deviation in the $Zbb$ or $Z\tau\tau$ couplings that can be
conclusively tested with electroweak precision measurements at planned lepton

dimer, and hexamer, using q-TIP4P/F, one of the most simple, empirical water
models with flexible monomers. The bias in the time step ($\Delta\tau$) and
population size ($N_w$) is investigated. For the binding energies, the bias in
$\Delta\tau$ cancels nearly completely, while a noticeable bias in $N_w$ still
remains. However, for the isotope shift, (e.g, in the dimer binding energies
between (H$_2$O)$_2$ and (D$_2$O)$_2$) the systematic errors in $N_w$ do
cancel. Consequently, very accurate results for the latter (within $\sim 0.01$
kcal/mol) are obtained with relatively moderate numerical effort ($N_w\sim
10^3$). For the water hexamer and its (D$_2$O)$_6$ isotopomer the DMC results
as a function of $N_w$ are examined for the cage and prism isomers. For a given
isomer, the issue of the walker population leaking out of the corresponding
basin of attraction is addressed by using appropriate geometric constraints.
The population size bias for the hexamer is more severe, and in order to
maintain accuracy similar to that of the dimer, the population size $N_w$ must
be increased by about two orders of magnitude. Fortunately, when the energy
difference between cage and prism is taken, the biases cancel, thereby reducing
the systematic errors to within $\sim 0.01$ kcal/mol when using a population of
$N_w=4.8\times 10^5$ walkers. Consequently, a very accurate result for the
isotope shift is also obtained. Notably, both the quantum and the isotope
effects for the prism-cage energy difference are small.

definition is $<S|T>=|S{\cap}T|$. This allows QM/sets to be developed with a
full probability calculus that turns out to be the perfectly classical
Laplace-Boole finite probability theory. The point is not to clarify finite

fields is compared with the one corresponding to a cosmological constant model.
This is done for different barotropic indexes $\gamma_0$ and the background
space time is assumed to be of the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
type. The differential equation describing the perturbations is solved
numerically and the power spectrum at the scale factor value $a=1$ is plotted
for each case. The result is that the power spectrum of the standard tachyon
field differs in many magnitude orders from the $\Lambda$CDM. However, the one
with $\gamma_0=1.91$, which corresponds to a complementary tachyon field,
coincides fairly well with the concordance model. Therefore, we conclude that
the perturbed solutions constitute an effective method to distinguish between
the different $\gamma_0$ values for the tachionization $\Lambda$CDM model and
the fiducial model. The Statefinder parameters $\{r, s\}$, measuring the
deviations of the analysed model from the concordance model, are also
explicitly calculated. Our result suggest that, depending on the value of
$\gamma_0$, these models can explain the observed expansion history or the
perturbation power spectrum of the universe, but they may have problems in
describing both features simultaneously.

types is correlated with the total number of normal stem cell divisions. Here,
we separate the effects of standing stem cell number (i.e., organ or tissue
size) and per stem cell lifetime replication rate. We show that each has a
statistically significant and independent effect on explaining variation in
cancer incidence over the 31 cases considered by Tomasetti and Vogelstein. When
considering the total number of stem cell divisions and when removing cases
associated with disease or carcinogens, we find that cancer incidence attains a
plateau of approximately 0.6% incidence for the cases considered by these
authors. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most
of the remaining variation in risk between cancer types. This new analysis
suggests that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions
but varies enormously ($\sim$10,000 times) depending on the stem cell's
environment. Future research should investigate how tissue characteristics
(anatomical site, type, size, stem cell divisions) explain cancer incidence
over a wider range of cancers, to what extent different tissues express
specific protective mechanisms, and whether any differential protection can be
attributed to natural selection.

  Warping",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classic similarity measures of strings are longest common subsequence and
Levenshtein distance (i.e., the classic edit distance). A classic similarity
measure of curves is dynamic time warping. These measures can be computed by
simple $O(n^2)$ dynamic programming algorithms, and despite much effort no
algorithms with significantly better running time are known.
  We prove that, even restricted to binary strings or one-dimensional curves,
respectively, these measures do not have strongly subquadratic time algorithms,
i.e., no algorithms with running time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ for any
$\varepsilon > 0$, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. We
generalize the result to edit distance for arbitrary fixed costs of the four
operations (deletion in one of the two strings, matching, substitution), by
identifying trivial cases that can be solved in constant time, and proving
quadratic-time hardness on binary strings for all other cost choices. This
improves and generalizes the known hardness result for Levenshtein distance
[Backurs, Indyk STOC'15] by the restriction to binary strings and the
generalization to arbitrary costs, and adds important problems to a recent line
of research showing conditional lower bounds for a growing number of quadratic
time problems.
  As our main technical contribution, we introduce a framework for proving
quadratic-time hardness of similarity measures. To apply the framework it
suffices to construct a single gadget, which encapsulates all the expressive
power necessary to emulate a reduction from satisfiability.
  Finally, we prove quadratic-time hardness for longest palindromic subsequence
and longest tandem subsequence via reductions from longest common subsequence,
showing that conditional lower bounds based on the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis also apply to string problems that are not necessarily similarity
measures.

NanoSIMS imaging of H isotopes of monoatomatic ($H^-$) and molecular ($OH^-$)
secondary ions collected at the same location. This allowed the most enriched

protocol, we found that in carbonaceous chondrites the isotopically homogeneous
hydrous silicates are mixed with D-rich organic matter. The opposite was
observed in Semarkona. Hydrous silicates in Semarkona display highly

not show such large isotopic variations. This suggests limited isotopic
exchange between the two phases during aqueous alteration. Our study greatly
expands the range of water isotopic values measured so far in solar system
objects. This D-rich water reservoir was sampled by the LL ordinary chondrite

transient source named MAXI J1421-613. Because of the detection of three X-ray
bursts from the source, it was identified as a neutron star low-mass X-ray
binary. The results of data analyses of the MAXI GSC and the Swift XRT
follow-up observations suggest that the spectral hardness remained unchanged
during the first two weeks of the outburst. All the XRT spectra in the 0.5-10
keV band can be well explained by thermal Comptonization of multi-color disk
blackbody emission. The photon index of the Comptonized component is $\approx$
2, which is typical of low-mass X-ray binaries in the low/hard state. Since
X-ray bursts have a maximum peak luminosity, it is possible to estimate the
(maximum) distance from its observed peak flux. The peak flux of the second
X-ray burst, which was observed by the GSC, is about 5 photons cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. By assuming a blackbody spectrum of 2.5 keV, the maximum distance to
the source is estimated as 7 kpc. The position of this source is contained by
the large error regions of two bright X-ray sources detected with Orbiting
Solar Observatory-7 (OSO-7) in 1970s. Besides this, no past activities at the
XRT position are reported in the literature. If MAXI J1421-613 is the same
source as (one of) them, the outburst observed with MAXI may have occurred
after the quiescence of 30-40 years.

multiphase clock implemented using a single field-programmable gate array is
discussed in this paper. The TDC can increase the resolution of the measurement
by using time interpolation. A phase-locked loop is used to generate four
multiphase clocks whose frequencies are the same and whose phases are 0{\deg},
45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, and 135{\deg}. In addition, the duty ratios of the four
clocks are 50%. By utilizing four multiphase clocks to make up the
interpolation clock, one clock period can be divided into eight uniform parts.
The resolution of the TDC can be improved to 1/8 of a clock period.
Furthermore, we have also designed a discriminator circuit for identifying the
start and stop signals. On the basis of this circuit, the TDC can still measure
the time interval of two signals when the start and stop signals are uncertain.
The experimental results indicate that the time resolution of the TDC can
achieve the theoretical value, and the linearity is very good. The architecture
consumes fewer logic cells and is more stable.

realized in an $S=1/2$ spin model ($J$-$Q$ model) and studied using projector
Monte Carlo simulations in the valence bond basis. A topological excitation
with winding number $|W|>0$ contains domain walls, which are unstable due to
the emergence of long valence bonds in the wave function, unlike in effective
descriptions with the quantum dimer model. We find that the life time of the
winding number in imaginary time diverges as a power of the system length $L$.
The energy can be computed within this time (i.e., it converges toward a
""quasi-eigenvalue"" before the winding number decays) and agrees for large $L$
with the domain-wall energy computed in an open lattice with boundary
modifications enforcing a domain wall. Constructing a simplified two-state
model and using the imaginary-time behavior from the simulations as input, we
find that the real-time decay rate out of the initial winding sector is
exponentially small in $L$. Thus, the winding number rapidly becomes a
well-defined conserved quantum number for large systems, supporting the
conclusions reached by computing the energy quasi-eigenvalues. Including
Heisenberg exchange interactions which brings the system to a quantum-critical
point separating the valence-bond solid from an antiferromagnetic ground state
(the putative ""deconfined"" quantum-critical point), we can also converge the
domain wall energy here and find that it decays as a power-law of the system
size. Thus, the winding number is an emergent quantum number also at the
critical point, with all winding number sectors becoming degenerate in the
thermodynamic limit. This supports the description of the critical point in
terms of a U(1) gauge-field theory.

themselves come in two types: the more luminous AGNs with more luminous
post-starburst stellar populations hosted by elliptical galaxies, some which
are clearly merger products, and the less luminous systems existing within
relatively undisturbed spiral galaxies and possessing signs of a more extended
period of star formation. Post-starburst galaxies (PSQs) have elliptical and
disturbed/post-merger morphologies similar to those of the more luminous PSQs,
display similar spectral properties, but also can have younger stellar
populations for a given starburst mass. Quasars at similar redshifts and
luminosities around the Seyfert/quasar transition possess similar AGN
characteristics, in terms of black hole mass and accretion rate, compared with
those of PSQs, but do not appear to be hosted by galaxies with significant
post-starburst populations. Recent studies of more luminous quasars find hosts
consistent with those of our luminous PSQs, suggesting that these PSQs may be
in transition between post-starburst galaxies and a more luminous quasar stage
when the post-starburst stellar population remains dominant. The lower
luminosity PSQs appear to differ from lower luminosity quasars (Seyfert
galaxies) in terms of more significant star formation in their past.

separated by a temperature dependent energy offset are considered. The extremum
of the light hole band has a density of states mass 0.27mo at room temperature.
It is non-parabolic and anisotropic and can be described by the Kane model. The

demonstrated the advantages of feature-level fusion based on the joint sparse

The resulting multimodal dictionaries can generate discriminative latent

high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Many state-of-the-art methods, e.g.
bag-of-visual-words model and its variants, the topic models as well as deep
learning-based approaches, share similar procedures: patch sampling, feature
description/learning and classification. Patch sampling is the first and a key
procedure which has a great influence on the results. In the literature, many
different sampling strategies have been used, {e.g. dense sampling, random
sampling, keypoint-based sampling and saliency-based sampling, etc. However, it
is still not clear which sampling strategy is suitable for the scene
classification of high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we
comparatively study the effects of different sampling strategies under the
scenario of scene classification of high-resolution remote sensing images. We
divide the existing sampling methods into two types: dense sampling and sparse
sampling, the later of which includes random sampling, keypoint-based sampling
and various saliency-based sampling proposed recently. In order to compare
their performances, we rely on a standard bag-of-visual-words model to
construct our testing scheme, owing to their simplicity, robustness and
efficiency. The experimental results on two commonly used datasets show that
dense sampling has the best performance among all the strategies but with high
spatial and computational complexity, random sampling gives better or
comparable results than other sparse sampling methods, like the sophisticated
multi-scale key-point operators and the saliency-based methods which are
intensively studied and commonly used recently.

nanostructured gas-adsorbent materials (GAM) like carbon nanocomposites and
metal-organic frameworks are becoming increasingly more influential in our
everyday lives. First-principles methods based on density functional theory
(DFT) have been pivotal in establishing the rational design of GAM, a factor
which has tremendously boosted their development. However, DFT methods are not
perfect and due to the stringent accuracy thresholds demanded in modelling of
GAM (i.e., exact binding energies to within ~0.01 eV) these techniques may
provide erroneous conclusions in some challenging situations. Examples of
problematic circumstances include gas-adsorption processes in which both
electronic long-range exchange and nonlocal correlations are important, and
systems where many-body energy and Coulomb screening effects cannot be
disregarded. In this critical review, we analyse recent efforts done in the
assessment of the performance of DFT methods in the prediction and
understanding of GAM. Our inquiry is constrained to the areas of hydrogen
storage and carbon capture and sequestration, for which we expose a number of
unresolved modelling controversies and define a set of best practice simulation
principles. Also, we identify the subtle problems found in the generalization
of DFT benchmark studies performed in model cluster systems to real materials,
and discuss effective approaches to circumvent them. The increasing awareness
of the strengths and imperfections of DFT methods in the simulation of
gas-adsorption phenomena should lead in the medium term to more precise, and
hence even more fruitful, ab initio engineering of GAM.

reprocessing of X-rays by the outer regions of an accretion disk. The structure
of the outer disk may be altered due to the presence of X-ray irradiation and
we discuss the physical regimes where this may occur and point out certain
X-ray binaries where this effect may be important. The long term X-ray
variability of these sources is believed to be due to stochastic fluctuations
in the outer disk, which propagate inwards giving rise to accretion rate
variation in the X-ray producing inner regions. The X-ray variability will
induce structural variations in the outer disk which in turn may affect the
inner accretion rate. To understand the qualitative behaviour of the disk in
such a scenario, we adopt simplistic assumptions that the disk is fully ionised
and is not warped. We develop and use a time dependent global hydrodynamical
code to study the effect of a sinusoidal accretion rate perturbation introduced
at a specific radius. The response of the disk, especially the inner accretion
rate, to such perturbations at different radii and with different time periods
is shown. While we didn't find any oscillatory or limit cycle behaviour, our
results show that irradiation enhances the X-ray variability at time-scales
corresponding to the viscous time-scales of the irradiated disk.

sintering of Sn causes a strong degradation of SnO-based anodes. When the
initial irreversible transformation ends, active anode grains consist of
Li-oxide layers separated by Sn bilayers. During the following reversible
lithiation, the Li-oxide undergoes two phase transformations that give rise to
a Li-enrichment of the oxide and the formation of a layered SnLi composite. We
find that the model-predicted anode volume expansion and voltage profile agree
well with experiment, and a layered anode grain is highly-conductive and has a
theoretical reversible capacity of 4.5 Li atoms per a SnO host unit. The model
suggests that the grain structure has to remain layered to sustain its

it is often difficult to pinpoint which features of a particular system are
intrinsically ""quantum"". Perhapse, the most clear-cut distinction between
""classical"" and ""quantum"" can be made for systems composed of many particles
when the properties of the ensemble are determined by the correlations between
the constituents. The issue of grasping the nature of entanglement (i.e.
quantum correlations) lies in its formal, discriminative definition: ""if state
is not classical then it is entangled"". A possible remedy would be to approach
the problem from the utilitarian point of view. The idea is that certain tasks
can be performed better when entangled states are used instead of states that
are only classically correlated. An example of such task is an
entanglement-enhanced interferometer utilizing ensembles of ultra-cold atoms.
This line of reasoning leads to the concept of classification of entanglement
by the degree of usefulness and allows to relate it to certain well-defined
physical properties of the state. The aim of this work is to formalize this
abstraction and build upon it an intuitive picture which can help us understand
what the entanglement is.

of smooth densities $f$ admits an explicit inverse $Z$; however $Z$ cannot
directly reconstruct $f$ from ROI-truncated projections. To deal with the ROI
tomography problem, we introduce a novel reconstruction approach. For densities
$f$ in $L^{\infty}(B)$ where $B$ is a bounded ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, our
method iterates an operator $U$ combining ROI-truncated projections, inversion
by the operator $Z$ and appropriate regularization operators. Assuming only

critical ROI radius ensuring the convergence of the ROI reconstruction

presented. Robustness is based on the joint adoption of the Cluster Weighted
Model and of an estimator based on trimming and restrictions. The selected
model provides the conditional distribution of the response for each group, as
in mixtures of regression, and further supplies local distributions for the
explanatory variables. A novel version of the restrictions has been devised,
under this model, for separately controlling the two sources of variability
identified in it. This proposal avoids singularities in the log-likelihood,
caused by approximate local collinearity in the explanatory variables or local
exact fit in regressions, and reduces the occurrence of spurious local
maximizers. In a natural way, due to the interaction between the model and the
estimator, the procedure is able to resist the harmful influence of bad
leverage points along the estimation of the mixture of regressions, which is
still an open issue in the literature. The given methodology defines a
well-posed statistical problem, whose estimator exists and is consistent to the
corresponding solution of the population optimum, under widely general

context of the structure formation in our Universe such collapsed objects,
e.g., halos/galaxies, could be considered as bias tracers of underlying matter
fluctuations and the halo/galaxy bias has been studied well. Employing a
peak-background split picture which is known to be a useful tool to discuss the

local-type non-Gaussianity. If PBHs account for the DM abundance, such a large
scale clustering of PBHs behaves as nothing but the matter isocurvature
perturbation and constrained strictly by the observations of cosmic microwave
backgrounds (CMB). From this constraint, we show that, in the case a certain
single field causes both CMB temperature perturbations and PBH formations, the
PBH-DM scenario is excluded even with quite small local-type non-Gaussianity,
$|f_\mathrm{NL}|\sim\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, while we give the constraints to

current $J_a^i$ if $i \neq a$, or $J_j^j$, with $j\ne i$, if $i= a$. Contrary
to naive expectation, the homogeneous spin current associated with the uniform

generated, if a magnetic field is present, by a completely different mechanism,
namely, the precession of the spin Hall spin current in the magnetic field. We
refer to this second mechanism as Hanle spin Hall effect, and we notice that it
can be observed in an experiment in which a homogeneous drift current is passed
through a uniformly magnetized electron gas. In contrast to this, we show that
an unambiguous observation of SCS requires inhomogeneous spin currents, such as
those that are associated with spin diffusion in a metal, and no magnetic

However, a strong intraband absorption at THz frequencies still poses a
challenge for efficient THz lasing. In this paper, we show that in the pumped
graphene bilayer structures, the indirect interband radiative transitions
accompanied by scattering of carriers caused by disorder can provide a
substantial negative contribution to the THz conductivity (together with the
direct interband transitions).
  In the graphene bilayer structures on high-$\kappa$ substrates with point
charged defects, these transitions almost fully compensate the losses due to
the intraband (Drude) absorption. We also demonstrate that the indirect
interband contribution to the THz conductivity in a graphene bilayer with the
extended defects (such as the charged impurity clusters, surface corrugation,

with the direct interband transitions and the Drude conductivity. These
predictions can affect the strategy of the graphene-based THz laser

a kiloton scale gadolinium-doped (Gd) light water Cherenkov detector, placed 13
kilometers from a civil nuclear reactor in the United States. In its first
deployment phase, WATCHMAN will be used to remotely detect a change in the
operational status of the reactor, providing a first- ever demonstration of the

future international nuclear nonproliferation applications.
  During its first phase, the detector will provide a critical large-scale test
of the ability to tag neutrons and thus distinguish low energy electron
neutrinos and antineutrinos. This would make WATCHMAN the only detector capable
of providing both direction and flavor identification of supernova neutrinos.
It would also be the third largest supernova detector, and the largest
underground in the western hemisphere. In a follow-on phase incorporating the
IsoDAR neutrino beam, the detector would have world-class sensitivity to
sterile neutrino signatures and to non-standard electroweak interactions (NSI).
WATCHMAN will also be a major, U.S. based integration platform for a host of
technologies relevant for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and other
future large detectors.

$B_0$ of $f(R)$ gravity as well as the mass of sterile neutrino by using the
cosmic microwave background observations, the baryon acoustic oscillation
surveys, and the linear growth rate measurements. Since both the $f(R)$ model
and the sterile neutrino generally predict scale-dependent growth rates, we
utilize the growth rate data measured in different wavenumber bins with the
theoretical growth rate approximatively scale-independent in each bin. The
employed growth rate data come from the peculiar velocity measurements at $z=0$
in five wavenumber bins, and the redshift space distortions measurements at
$z=0.25$ and $z=0.37$ in one wavenumber bin. By constraining the $f(R)$ model
alone, we get a tight 95\% upper limit of $\log_{10}B_0<-4.1$. This result is
slightly weakened to $\log_{10}B_0<-3.8$ (at 2$\sigma$ level) once we
simultaneously constrain the $f(R)$ model and the sterile neutrino mass, due to
the degeneracy between the parameters of the two. For the massive sterile
neutrino parameters, we get the effective sterile neutrino mass
$m_{\nu,{\rm{sterile}}}^{\rm{eff}}<0.62$ eV (2$\sigma$) and the effective
number of relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}<3.90$ (2$\sigma$) in the $f(R)$

V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and statistically significant sample of stars
probing the different populations of the Milky Way, in particular the thin and
thick disks. METHODS: Using high-resolution spectra obtained with MIKE, FEROS,
SOFIN, FIES, UVES and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co
abundances for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in Solar neighbourhood. The
method is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional (1-D),
plane-parallel, LTE model stellar atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012
code. NLTE corrections from literature were applied to Mn and Co. RESULTS: We
find that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and
Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the
alpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is
generally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0.
Also, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is
almost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span
(-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation
between the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap.
For Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections
are used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference element show flat trends for all
the elements except for Mn that show well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for
the thin and thick disks. CONCLUSIONS: Sc and V present trends compatible with
production from SNII events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a metallicity
dependence for [Fe/H]<-1. Mn instead is produced in SNII events for [Fe/H]<-0.4
and then SNIa start to produce Mn. Finally, Co appears to be produced mainly in
SNII with suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low metallicities.

surrounds this large-scale flow, given that its measurement using current

global simulations of solar convection to infer the dynamical behavior of the
established meridional circulation. We make a direct comparison between the
meridional circulation that arises in these simulations and the latest
observations. Based on our results we argue that there should be an equatorward
flow at the base of the convection zone at mid latitudes, below the current
maximum depth helioseismic measures can probe (0.75 R). We also provide
physical arguments to justify this behaviour. The simulations indicate that the
meridional circulation undergoes substantial changes in morphology as the
magnetic cycle unfolds. We close by discussing the importance of these
dynamical changes for current methods of observation that involve long
averaging periods of helioseismic data. Also noteworthy is the fact that these
topological changes indicate a rich interaction between magnetic fields and
plasma flows, which challenges the ubiquitous kinematic approach used in the

clear that the SNS, as an optical technique, demonstrates properties lying far

dependence of the signal on the light power density, makes it possible to
penetrate inside an inhomogeneously broadened absorption band and to determine
its homogeneous width, allows one to realize an effective pump-probe

that the parameters $d$ and $\Omega_{hde}$ are divided into a few domains in
which the fate of the universe is quite different. We investigate dynamical
behaviors of this model, and especially the future evolution of the universe.
We perform fitting analysis on the cosmological parameters in the $\Lambda$HDE
model by using the recent observational data. We find the model yields
$\chi^2_{\rm min}=426.27$ when constrained by $\rm Planck+SNLS3+BAO+HST$,
comparable to the results of the HDE model (428.20) and the concordant
$\Lambda$CDM model (431.35). At 68.3\% CL, we obtain
$-0.07<\Omega_{\Lambda0}<0.68$ and correspondingly $0.04<\Omega_{hde0}<0.79$,

characteristic of the design philosophy behind future wireless communication
networks. As an example, different devices may have different implementations,
leading to different user experiences. A similar story emerges when devices
running different physical and link layer protocols share frequencies in the
same spectrum in order to maximize the system-wide spectral efficiency. In such
situations, coordinating multiple interfering devices presents a significant
challenge not only from an interworking perspective (as a result of reduced
infrastructure), but also from an implementation point of view. The following
question may then naturally arise: How to accommodate integrating such
heterogeneous wireless devices seamlessly? One approach is to coordinate the
spectrum in a centralized manner. However, the desired autonomous feature of
future wireless systems makes the use of a central authority for spectrum
management less appealing. Alternately, intelligent spectrum coordination have
spurred great interest and excitement in the recent years. This paper presents
a multi-level (hierarchical) power control game where users jointly choose
their channel control and power control selfishly in order to maximize their
individual energy efficiency. By hierarchical, we mean that some users'
decision priority is higher/lower than the others. We propose two simple and
nearly-optimal algorithms that ensure complete spectrum coordination among
users. Interestingly, it turns out that the complexity of the two proposed
algorithms is, in the worst case, quadratic in the number of users, whereas the
complexity of the optimal solution (obtained through exhaustive search) is N!.

immersed boundary method (PIBM) for simulating fluid-particle multiphase flow
was proposed and assessed in both two- and three-dimensional applications. In
this study, the PIBM was extended to solve thermal interaction problems between
spherical particles and fluid. The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) was adopted
to solve the fluid flow and temperature fields, the PIBM was responsible for
the non-slip velocity and temperature boundary conditions at the particle
surface, and the kinematics and trajectory of the solid particles were
evaluated by the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Four case studies were
implemented to demonstrate the capability of the current coupling scheme.
Firstly, numerical simulation of natural convection in a two-dimensional square
cavity with an isothermal concentric annulus was carried out for verification
purpose. The current results were found to have good agreements with previous
references. Then, sedimentation of two- and three-dimensional isothermal
particles in fluid was numerically studied, respectively. The instantaneous

Within the core accretion scenario of planetary formation, most
simulations performed so far always assume the accreting envelope to have a
solar composition. From the study of meteorite showers on Earth and numerical
simulations, we know that planetesimals must undergo thermal ablation and
disruption when crossing a protoplanetary envelope. Once the protoplanet has
acquired an atmosphere, the primordial envelope gets enriched in volatiles and
silicates from the planetesimals. This change of envelope composition during
the formation can have a significant effect in the final atmospheric
composition and on the formation timescale of giant planets.
  Aims. To investigate the physical implications of considering the envelope
enrichment of protoplanets due to the disruption of icy planetesimals during
their way to the core. Particular focus is placed on the effect on the critical
core mass for envelopes where condensation of water can occur.
  Methods. Internal structure models are numerically solved with the
implementation of updated opacities for all ranges of metallicities and the
software CEA to compute the equation of state. CEA computes the chemical
equilibrium for an arbitrary mixture of gases and allows the condensation of
some species, including water. This means that the latent heat of phase
transitions is consistently incorporated in the total energy budget.
  Results. The critical core mass is found to decrease significantly when an
enriched envelope composition is considered in the internal structure
equations. A particular strong reduction of the critical core mass is obtained
for planets whose envelope metallicity is larger than Z=0.45 when the outer
boundary conditions are suitable for condensation of water to occur in the top
layers of the atmosphere. We show that this effect is qualitatively preserved
when the atmosphere is out of chemical equilibrium.

univariate associated kernels, also considered having diagonal bandwidth

the potential for significantly improved density estimation. In this paper,
general associated kernel estimators with correlation structure are introduced.
Properties of these estimators are presented; in particular, the boundary bias

more details. The associated kernel with a correlation structure is built with
a variant of the mode-dispersion method and two families of bandwidth matrices
are discussed under the criterion of cross-validation. Several simulation

qualitative convergence results developed in [28] for regularized full- and
partial-cloaks via the transformation-optics approach. Let $\Gamma_0$ be a
compact set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\Gamma_\delta$ be a $\delta$-neighborhood of
$\Gamma_0$ for $\delta\in\mathbb{R}_+$. $\Gamma_\delta$ represents the virtual
domain used for the blow-up construction. By incorporating suitably designed
lossy layers, it is shown that if the generating set $\Gamma_0$ is a generic
curve, then one would have an approximate full-cloak within $\delta^2$ to the
perfect full-cloak; whereas if $\Gamma_0$ is the closure of an open subset on a
flat surface, then one would have an approximate partial-cloak within $\delta$
to its perfect counterpart. The estimates derived are independent of the
contents being cloaked; that is, the cloaking devices are capable of nearly
cloaking an arbitrary content. Furthermore, as a significant byproduct, our
argument allows the relaxation of the convexity requirement on $\Gamma_0$ in
[28], which is critical for the Mosco convergence argument therein.

study nonclassical-state generation in a SQ which is driven by a classical

field can induce transitions between two energy levels of the SQs, which either
generate or annihilate, in a controllable way, different photon numbers of the
cavity field. The effective Hamiltonians of these classical-field-assisted
multiphoton processes of the single-mode cavity field are very similar to those
for cold ions, confined to a coaxial RF-ion trap and driven by a classical
field. We show that arbitrary superpositions of Fock states can be more
efficiently generated using these controllable multiphoton transitions, in
contrast to the single-photon resonant transition when there is only a SQ-field
transverse coupling. The experimental feasibility for different SQs is also
discussed.

Bregman divergences and present their characteristic properties in a unified
theoretical framework. In many situations it is preferable not to generate a
PSR directly from its convex entropy on the unit simplex but instead by the
sublinear extension of the entropy to the positive orthant. This gives the
scoring rule simply as a subgradient of the extended entropy, allowing for a
more elegant theory. The other convex extensions of the entropy generate affine
extensions of the scoring rule and induce the class of functional Bregman
divergences. We discuss the geometric nature of the relationship between PSRs

approach the topic of differentiability of entropy functions. Not all entropies
of interest possess functional derivatives, but they do all have directional
derivatives in almost every direction. Relying on the notion of quasi-interior
of a convex set to quantify the latter property, we formalise under what
conditions a PSR may be considered to be uniquely determined from its entropy.

(MTJ) with single-crystal barrier. The barrier will be treated as a diffraction
grating with intralayer periodicity, the diffracted waves of tunneling
electrons thus contain strong coherence, both in charge and especially in spin.
The theory can answer the two basic problems present in MgO-based MTJs: (1) Why
does the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) oscillate with the barrier
thickness? (2) Why is the TMR still far away from infinity when the two
electrodes are both half-metallic? Other principal features of TMR can also be
explained and reproduced by the present work. It also provides possible ways to
modulate the oscillation of TMR, and to enhance TMR so that it can tend to
infinity. Within the theory, the barrier, as a periodic diffraction grating,
can get rid of the confinement in width, it can vary from nanoscale to
microscale. Based on those results, a future-generation MTJ is proposed where
the three pieces can be fabricated separately and then assembled together, it
is especially appropriate for the layered materials, e.g., MoS2 and graphite,

caustic technique to dense redshift surveys of clusters and their outskirts,
where dynamical equilibrium does not necessarily hold. An additional probe of
the mass growth of clusters is their mass fraction in substructures. We show
that the caustic technique, that identifies cluster substructures as a

thermal fluctuations play negligible role. The pillars, consisting of
bidisperse cylindrical acetal plastic particles standing upright on a
substrate, are deformed uniaxially and quasistatically by a rigid bar moving at
a constant speed. The plastic flow and particle rearrangements in the pillars
are characterized by computing the best-fit affine transformation strain and
non-affine displacement associated with each particle between two stages of
deformation. The non-affine displacement exhibits exponential crossover from
ballistic to diffusive behavior with respect to the cumulative deviatoric
strain, indicating that in athermal granular packings, the cumulative
deviatoric strain plays the role of time in thermal systems and drives
effective particle diffusion. We further study the size-dependent deformation
of the granular pillars by simulation, and find that different-sized pillars
follow self-similar shape evolution during deformation. In addition, the yield
stress of the pillars increases linearly with pillar size. Formation of
transient shear lines in the pillars during deformation becomes more evident as
pillar size increases. The width of these elementary shear bands is about twice
the diameter of a particle, and does not vary with pillar size.

approximation of the steady state statistical structure of nonlinear systems
whose potential functions have bimodal shapes and which are subjected to
correlated excitations. Our approach relies on the derivation of moment
equations that describe the dynamics governing the two-time statistics. These
are combined with a non-Gaussian pdf representation for the joint
response-excitation statistics that has i) single time statistical structure
consistent with the analytical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, and ii)
two-time statistical structure with Gaussian characteristics. Through the
adopted pdf representation, we derive a closure scheme which we formulate in
terms of a consistency condition involving the second order statistics of the
response, the closure constraint. A similar condition, the dynamics constraint,
is also derived directly through the moment equations. These two constraints
are formulated as a low-dimensional minimization problem with respect to
unknown parameters of the representation, the minimization of which imposes an
interplay between the dynamics and the adopted closure. The new method allows
for the semi-analytical representation of the two-time, non-Gaussian structure
of the solution as well as the joint statistical structure of the
response-excitation over different time instants. We demonstrate its
effectiveness through the application on bistable nonlinear
single-degree-of-freedom energy harvesters with mechanical and electromagnetic
damping, and we show that the results compare favorably with direct Monte-Carlo

  We suggest that the variation in the expectation value of a good uplifting
term, due to the shift in the minimum of the potential after uplifting, is much
smaller than the original cosmological constant. This is studied with some
detail in Large volume scenarios where the dependency on the volume direction
is rather generic and easy to spot. Here we find that an uplifting term in the
potential, with generic form $V_{up}\sim 1/{\cal V}^\gamma$, should be
restricted to the one satisfying $\gamma^2\ll 12$.
  Such a bound might explain why in models previously studied no uplifting has
been achieved, and gives motivations to study a novel proposal of dilaton
dependent uplifting mechanism for which no numerical studies has been performed
before. We find that in this case it is actually possible to get a dS vacuum,
but still leave open the question of a more precise discrimination feature the
good uplifting mechanisms should satisfy.

appropriate strategies for containing its spread in a population. Recent
mathematical models are aimed at studying dynamics of some specific types of
infectious diseases. In this paper we propose a new model for infectious
diseases spread having susceptible, infected, and recovered populations and
study its dynamics in presence of incubation delays and relapse of the disease.
The influence of treatment and vaccination efforts on the spread of infection
in presence of time delays are studied. Sufficient conditions for local
stability of the equilibria and change of stability are derived in various
cases. The problem of global stability is studied for an important special case
of the model. Simulations carried out in this study brought out the importance
of treatment rate in controlling the disease spread. It is observed that
incubation delays have influence on the system even under enhanced vaccination.
The present study has clearly brought out the fact that treatment rate in
presence of time delays would contain the disease as compared to popular belief
that eradication can only be done through vaccination.

functionals of the maximum of the BM, of the form ${\cal
O}_{\max}(t)=\int_0^t\, V(x_{\max} - x(\tau)) {\rm d} \tau$ where $V(x)$ can be
any arbitrary function and develop various analytical tools to compute their
statistical properties. These tools rely in particular on (i) a ""counting
paths"" method and (ii) a path-integral approach. In particular, we focus on the
case where $V(x) = \delta(x-r)$, with $r$ a real parameter, which is relevant
to study the density of near-extreme values of the BM (the so called density of
states), $\rho(r,t)$, which is the local time of the BM spent at given distance
$r$ from the maximum. We also provide a thorough analysis of the family of
functionals ${T}_{\alpha}(t)=\int_0^t (x_{\max} - x(\tau))^\alpha \, {\rm
d}\tau$, corresponding to $V(x) = x^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ real. As $\alpha$ is
varied, $T_\alpha(t)$ interpolates between different interesting observables.
For instance, for $\alpha =1$, $T_{\alpha = 1}(t)$ is a random variable of the
""area"", or ""Airy"", type while for $\alpha=-1/2$ it corresponds to the maximum
time spent by a ballistic particle through a Brownian random potential. On the
other hand, for $\alpha = -1$, it corresponds to the cost of the optimal
algorithm to find the maximum of a discrete random walk, proposed by Odlyzko.
We revisit here, using tools of theoretical physics, the statistical properties
of this algorithm which had been studied before using probabilistic methods.
Finally, we extend our methods to constrained BM, including in particular the
Brownian bridge, i.e., the Brownian motion starting and ending at the origin.

conducted a detailed radio study that includes the search for pulsations and a

Low-frequency imaging at 624 MHz and pulsar observations at 624 and 1404 MHz
towards G15.4+0.1 were carried out with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(GMRT). We correlated the new radio data with observations of the source at

respectively. To characterize the neutral hydrogen medium (HI) towards
G15.4+0.1, we used data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. We modelled
the spectral energy distribution using both hadronic and leptonic scenarios.
From the combination of the new GMRT observations with existing data, we
derived a continuum spectral index alpha=-0.62+-0.03 for the whole remnant. The
local synchrotron spectra of G15.4+0.1, calculated from the combination of the
GMRT data with 330 MHz observations from the VLA, tends to be flatter in the
central part of the remnant, accompanying the region where the blast wave is
impinging molecular gas. No spectral index trace was found indicating the radio
counterpart to the pulsar wind nebula proposed from X-ray observations. In
addition, the search for radio pulsations yielded negative results. Emission at
far-infrared wavelengths is observed in the region where the SNR shock is
interacting with dense molecular clumps. We also identified HI features forming
a shell that wraps most of the outer border of G15.4+0.1. Characteristic
parameters were estimated for the shocked HI gas. We found that either a purely
hadronic or leptonic model is compatible with the broadband emission known so

Dirac prescription for the observables of a totally constrained system

observables approach in a particular limit. Difficulties such as the
non-unitary evolution of the complete observables in terms of certain partial
observables are explained as a breakdown of this limit. Identification of our
observables (`mutables') relies upon a physical distinction between gauge
symmetries that exist at the level of histories and states (`Type 1'), and
those that exist at the level of histories and not states (`Type 2'). This
distinction resolves a tension in the literature concerning the physical
interpretation of the partial observables and allows for a richer class of

theory is trivial while vacuum in the equivalent canonical representation of

  Purpose: Understand the relation between the vacuum in light-front and
canonical representations of quantum field theory and the role of zero-modes in
this relation.
  Method: Vacuua are defined as linear functionals on an algebra of field
operators. The role of the algebra in the definition of the vacuum is exploited
to understand this relation.
  Results: The vacuum functional can be extended from the light-front Fock
algebra to an algebra of local observables. The extension to the algebra of
local observables is responsible for the inequivalence. The extension defines a
unitary mapping between the physical representation of the local algebra and a
sub-algebra of the light-front Fock algebra.
  Conclusion: There is a unitary mapping from the physical representation of
the algebra of local observables to a sub-algebra of the light-front Fock
algebra with the free light-front Fock vacuum. The dynamics appears in the
mapping and the structure of the sub-algebra. This correspondence provides a
formulation of locality and Poincar\'e invariance on the light-front Fock

obtained at large $p$, but for $p/M$ arbitrarily small. It is furthermore

where phase separation, accompanied by domain coarsening, is a relevant
phenomenon. We first elucidate the intrinsic non-equilibrium, or athermal,
nature of granular media. Thereafter, dilute systems, the so-called ""granular
gases"" are discussed: idealized kinetic models, such as the gas of inelastic
hard spheres in the cooling regime, are the optimal playground to study the
slow growth of correlated structures, e.g. shear patterns, vortices and
clusters. In fluidized experiments, liquid-gas or solid-gas separations have
been observed. In the case of monolayers of particles, phase coexistence and
coarsening appear in several different setups, with mechanical or electrostatic
energy input. Phenomenological models describe, even quantitatively, several
experimental measures, both for the coarsening dynamics and for the dynamic
transition between different granular phases. The origin of the underlying
bistability is in general related to negative compressibility from granular
hydrodynamics computations, even if the understanding of the mechanism is far
from complete. A relevant problem, with important industrial applications, is
related to the demixing or segregation of mixtures, for instance in rotating

and Public Health planning. For multi-serotype pathogens, however, different
levels of serotype-specific immunity make it difficult to assess the population
at risk. In this paper we propose a Bayesian method for estimation of the
attack ratio of an epidemic and the initial fraction of susceptibles using
aggregated incidence data. We derive the probability distribution of the
effective reproductive number, R t , and use MCMC to obtain posterior
distributions of the parameters of a single-strain SIR transmission model with
time-varying force of infection. Our method is showcased in a data set
consisting of 18 years of dengue incidence in the city of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn about the initial fraction
of susceptibles and the attack ratio even in the absence of serotype specific
data. On the other hand, the information provided by this approach is limited,
stressing the need for detailed serological surveys to characterise the
distribution of serotype-specific immunity in the population.

in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n=2,3$, by only a few high-frequency acoustic
backscattering measurements. The obstacle could be sound-soft or sound-hard. It
is shown that the modulus of the far-field pattern in the backscattering
aperture possesses a certain local maximum behavior, from which one can
determine the exterior normal directions of the front sides/faces. Then by
using the phaseless backscattering data corresponding to a few incident plane
waves with suitably chosen incident directions, one can determine the exterior
unit normal vector of each side/face of the obstacle. After the determination
of the exterior unit normals, the recovery is reduced to a finite-dimensional
problem of determining a location point of the obstacle and the distance of
each side/face away from the location point. For the latter reconstruction, we
need make use of the far-field data with phases. Numerical experiments are also
presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

dynamic attributes associated with vulnerabilities that can change over time.
Our model is novel as existing research in attack graph analysis do not
consider the temporal aspects associated with the vulnerabilities, such as the
availability of exploits and patches which can affect the overall network
security based on how the vulnerabilities are interconnected and leveraged to
compromise the system. In order to have a more realistic representation of how
the security state of the network would vary over time, a nonhomogeneous model
is developed which incorporates a time dependent covariate, namely the
vulnerability age. The daily transition-probability matrices are estimated
using Frei's Vulnerability Lifecycle model. We also leverage the trusted CVSS
metric domain to analyze how the total exploitability and impact measures
evolve over a time period for a given network.

is performed differently compared with other objects. Converging reports, both
physiologically and psychophysically, indicate that faces are processed in
specialized neural networks in the brain -i.e. face patches in monkeys and the
fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. We are all expert face-processing agents,
and able to identify very subtle differences within the category of faces,
despite substantial visual and featural similarities. Identification is
performed rapidly and accurately after viewing a whole face, while
significantly drops if some of the face configurations (e.g. inversion,
misalignment) are manipulated or if partial views of faces are shown due to
occlusion. This refers to a hotly-debated, yet highly-supported concept, known
as holistic face processing. We built a hierarchical computational model of
face-processing based on evidence from recent neuronal and behavioural studies
on faces processing in primates. Representational geometries of the last three
layers of the model have characteristics similar to those observed in monkey
face patches (posterior, middle and anterior patches). Furthermore, several
face-processing-related phenomena reported in the literature automatically
emerge as properties of this model. The representations are evolved through
several computational layers, using biologically plausible learning rules. The
model satisfies face inversion effect, composite face effect, other race
effect, view and identity selectivity, and canonical face views. To our
knowledge, no models have so far been proposed with this performance and
agreement with biological data.

orbits of the most massive stars shrink, while the lighter stars move outwards
from the cluster centre. In this context, recent observations and dynamical
modelling of several galactic and extra-galactic globular clusters (GCs)
suggest that most of them show, close to their centre, an overabundance of mass
whose nature is still matter of debate. For instance, many works show that
orbitally segregated stars may collide with each other in a runaway fashion,
leading to the formation of a very massive star or an intermediate mass black
hole (IMBH) with a mass comparable to the observed mass excess. On the other
hand, segregated stars can form a dense system if the IMBH formation fails. In
this paper we study the early formation phase of a dense, massive sub-system
(MSS) in several GCs models using a recently developed semi-analytical
treatment of the mass segregation process. In order to investigate how the MSS
properties depend on the host cluster properties, we varied initial mass
function (IMF), total mass, spatial distribution and metallicity of our models.
Our results show how the IMF contributes to determine the final mass of the
MSS, while the metallicity and the spatial distribution play a minor role. The
method presented in this paper allowed us to provide scaling relations that
connect the MSS mass and the host cluster mass in agreement with the observed
correlation. In order to follow the early formation stage of the MSSs and
improve our statistical results, we performed several $N$-body simulations of
stellar clusters with masses between $10^3$ and $2\times 10^5$ solar masses.

question in biology. Several models have been proposed for explaining the
origin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,
previous models only demonstrate either two important observations for the
allometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of
3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this
study, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that
total surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two
observations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic
rate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both
theoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law
although several different biological strategies are considered. The model
validity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the
importance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric
scaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the
origin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of
the model.
