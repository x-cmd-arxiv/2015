groups has recently undergone intensive development, revealing deep connections
with operator algebras and other areas. The discrete Heisenberg group is the
simplest noncommutative example, where dynamical phenomena related to its
noncommutativity already illustrate many of these connections. The explicit
structure of this group means that these phenomena have concrete descriptions,
which are not only instances of the general theory but are also testing grounds
for further work. We survey here what is known about such actions of the
discrete Heisenberg group, providing numerous examples and emphasizing many of
the open problems that remain.

after commutation with Mellin convolutions depending on the poles of the kernel
(in contrast to commutants with Fourier convolution operatiors.) The second

constants, which are in agreement with structure based calculations.
Counterintuitively, the vibrational levels on the carotenoid electronic ground

paper establishes these conjectures rigorously. We measure performance with the
normalized squared error
$\mathrm{NSE}(\sigma):=\|\hat{\mathbf{x}}-\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2/\sigma^2$.
Assuming the entries of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be i.i.d. standard
normal, we precisely characterize the ""asymptotic NSE""
$\mathrm{aNSE}:=\lim_{\sigma\rightarrow 0}\mathrm{NSE}(\sigma)$ when the
problem dimensions $m,n$ tend to infinity in a proportional manner. The role of
$\lambda,f$ and $\mathbf{x}_0$ is explicitly captured in the derived expression
via means of a single geometric quantity, the Gaussian distance to the
subdifferential. We conjecture that $\mathrm{aNSE} =
\sup_{\sigma>0}\mathrm{NSE}(\sigma)$. We include detailed discussions on the
interpretation of our result, make connections to relevant literature and
perform computational experiments that validate our theoretical findings.

shown that they give a nonzero force, and that only tend to comply with the
action-to-reaction force in the limit of instantaneous interactions. The
arrangement of sub-systems provide a handy way to optimize the unbalanced EM
force with the concept of impedance matching. The general properties of the
differential electromagnetic force (DEF) are the following: i) it is
proportional to the square of the intensity and to the angular wave frequency
$\omega$; ii) to the space between the sub-systems (although in a non-linear
manner); iii) it is inversely proportional to the speed of interaction; iv)
when the two sub-systems are out-of-phase, DEF is null. The approach is of
interest to practical engineering principles of propulsion since it offers
guiding principles useful to build prototypes.

incorrectly merging or splitting author identities. The use of initial-based

affect research findings too much. This paper tests this assumption by
analyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields - biology, computer
science, nanoscience, neuroscience, and physics - and an interdisciplinary
journal, PNAS. Name instances in datasets of this study were disambiguated
based on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions.
We use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of
three types of initial-based disambiguation. Our results show that
initial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of
coauthorship networks: it deflates the number of unique authors, number of
component, average shortest paths, clustering coefficient, and assortativity,
while it inflates average productivity, density, average coauthor number per
author, and largest component size. Also, on average, more than half of top 10
productive or collaborative authors drop off the lists. Asian names were found
to account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based

producing type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The super-Eddington wind can naturally
prevent the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) with high mass-accretion rates
from becoming red-giant-like stars. Furthermore, it works in low-metallicity
environments, which may explain SNe Ia observed at high redshifts. In this
article, we systematically investigated the most prominent single-degenerate
WD+MS channel based on the super-Eddington wind scenario. We combined the
Eggleton stellar evolution code with a rapid binary population synthesis (BPS)
approach to predict SN Ia birthrates for the WD+MS channel by adopting the
super-Eddington wind scenario and detailed mass-accumulation efficiencies of
H-shell flashes on the WDs. Our BPS calculations found that the estimated SN Ia
birthrates for the WD+MS channel are ~0.009-0.315*10^{-3}{yr}^{-1} if we adopt
the Eddington accretion rate as the critical accretion rate, which are much
lower than that of the observations (<10% of the observed SN Ia birthrates).
This indicates that the WD+MS channel only contributes a small proportion of
all SNe Ia. The birthrates in this simulation are lower than previous studies,
the main reason of which is that new mass-accumulation efficiencies of H-shell
flashes are adopted. We also found that the critical mass-accretion rate has a
significant influence on the birthrates of SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the results of
our BPS calculations are sensitive to the values of the common-envelope
ejection efficiency.

determined by the passage of magnetic structures across the visible solar disk.
Variations on solar cycle time scales are thought to be similarly due to
changes in surface magnetism with activity. Understanding the contribution of
magnetic structures to total solar irradiance and solar spectral irradiance
requires assessing their contributions as a function of disk position. Since
only relative photometry is possible from the ground, the contrasts of image
pixels are measured with respect to a center-to-limb intensity profile. Using
nine years of full-disk red and blue continuum images from the Precision Solar
Photometric Telescope at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (PSPT/MLSO), we
examine the sensitivity of continuum contrast measurements to the
center-to-limb profile definition. Profiles which differ only by the amount of
magnetic activity allowed in the pixels used to determine them yield oppositely
signed solar cycle length continuum contrast trends; either agreeing with the
result of Preminger et al. (2011) showing negative correlation with solar cycle
or disagreeing and showing positive correlation with solar cycle. Changes in
the center-to-limb profile shape over the solar cycle are responsible for the
contradictory contrast results, and we demonstrate that the lowest contrast
structures, internetwork and network, are most sensitive to these. Thus the
strengths of the full-disk, internetwork, and network photometric trends depend
critically on the magnetic flux density used in the quiet-sun definition. We
conclude that the contributions of low contrast magnetic structures to
variations in the solar continuum output, particularly to long-term variations,
are difficult, if not impossible, to determine without the use of radiometric
imaging.

many real-life problems, its use in sensitive domains has been limited due to
privacy concerns. A popular approach known as **differential privacy** offers
provable privacy guarantees, but it is often observed in practice that it could
substantially hamper learning accuracy. In this paper we study the learnability
(whether a problem can be learned by any algorithm) under Vapnik's general
learning setting with differential privacy constraint, and reveal some
intricate relationships between privacy, stability and learnability.
  In particular, we show that a problem is privately learnable **if an only
if** there is a private algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical
risk (AERM). In contrast, for non-private learning AERM alone is not sufficient
for learnability. This result suggests that when searching for private learning
algorithms, we can restrict the search to algorithms that are AERM. In light of
this, we propose a conceptual procedure that always finds a universally
consistent algorithm whenever the problem is learnable under privacy
constraint. We also propose a generic and practical algorithm and show that
under very general conditions it privately learns a wide class of learning
problems. Lastly, we extend some of the results to the more practical
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and establish the existence of a
phase-transition on the class of problems that are approximately privately
learnable with respect to how small $\delta$ needs to be.

Hamiltonian is divided in subsectors according to their symmetry. The rate of

integrability is weakly broken thermalization is slow, and becomes faster the
stronger the next-nearest neighbor interaction is. Three different regimes for
the rate of thermalization with respect to the strength of the integrability

to the integrable limit the off-diagonal matrix elements peak at higher

a low cost ubiquitous Internet connectivity, without significantly increasing
the network infrastructure investment. In this paper, we consider such a
network where the network operator encourages some of her subscribers to
operate as mobile Wi-Fi hotspots (hosts), providing Internet connectivity for
other subscribers (clients). We formulate the interaction between the operator
and mobile users as a two-stage game. In Stage I, the operator determines the
usage-based pricing and quota-based incentive mechanism for the data usage. In
Stage II, the mobile users make their decisions about whether to be a host, or
a client, or not a subscriber at all. We characterize how the users' membership
choices will affect each other's payoffs in Stage II, and how the operator
optimizes her decision in Stage I to maximize her profit. Our theoretical and
numerical results show that the operator's maximum profit increases with the
user density under the proposed hybrid pricing mechanism, and the profit gain
can be up to 50\% in a dense network comparing with a pricing-only approach
with no incentives.

  Cellular Networks","72 pages, 29 figures, 47 references",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing demand for advanced services in wireless networks raises the
problem for quality of service (QoS) provisioning with proper resource
management. In this research, such a provisioning technique for wireless
networks is performed by Call Admission Control (CAC). A new approach in CAC
named by Uniform Fractional Band (UFB) is proposed in this work for the
wireless networks for providing proper priority between new calls and handover
calls. This UFB scheme is basically a new style of handover priority scheme.
Handover priority is provided by two stages in this scheme which help the
network to utilize more resources. In addition, the handover call rate
estimation and its impact on QoS provisioning is discussed widely to attain the
optimum QoS in proposed handover priority scheme. In multiple services
providing wireless network, excessive call blocking of lower priority traffic
is very often event at very high traffic rate which is a concerning issue for
QoS provisioning. To attain such QoS provisioning for multiple services,
another CAC scheme is proposed in this research work. This scheme is recognized
by Uniform Band Thinning (UBT) scheme which is based on uniform thinning
technique (UTT) and this is quite similar idea as UFB scheme. In this scheme, a
set of channels experiences the fractionizing policy. This scheme reduces the
call blocking probabilities (CBP) of lower priority traffic classes without
notably increasing the CBP of the higher priority traffic classes. The
analytical functions of this scheme are deduced in general form which is useful
to deduce for any number of traffic classes. In addition, numerical analysis of
the proposed UBT scheme shows that the performances in terms of call blocking
probability, overall call blocking probability, and channel utilization are
improved and optimized compared to the conventional fixed guard channel scheme.

revise the previously proposed relations between the scatter time spectral
slope and the dispersion measure (DM). We found that the deviations from
theoretical predictions of the value of $\alpha$ appear for pulsars regardless
of their DM, however the DM-averaged value of the scaling index is almost
constant except for pulsars with very high DMs. Based on the obtained slopes we
were also able to estimate the amount of scattering at the standard frequency
of 1 GHz. We found that while the estimated standardized pulse broadening time
increases with DM the relation seems to be much flatter than it was previously
proposed, which suggests higher values of the scatter time for mid-DM pulsars,
and lower values of expected pulse broadening for highly dispersed sources.

plasma current towards the electrode gives rise to an anisotropic effective
interaction potential between the particles, with an algebraically long-ranged

Sitter (or quasi-de Sitter) regime, structure can form by thermal fluctuations
as such a space is thermal. The models of Dark Energy invoking holographic
principle fit naturally into such a category, and spontaneous formation of
isolated brains in otherwise empty space seems the most perplexing, creating
the paradox of Boltzmann Brains (BB). It is thus appropriate to ask if such
models can be made free from domination by Boltzmann Brains. Here we consider
only the simplest model, but adopt both the local and the global viewpoint in
the description of the Universe. In the former case, we find that if a
parameter $c$, which modulates the Dark Energy density, lies outside the
exponentially narrow strip around the most natural $c = 1$ line, the theory is
rendered BB-safe. In the later case, the bound on $c$ is exponentially
stronger, and seemingly at odds with those bounds on $c$ obtained from various
observational tests.

suggested that, despite large uncertainties in the background determination,
the spectrum is inconsistent with a hadronic origin. We update the GeV-band
spectra using improved estimates for the diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission
and more than doubled data volume. We further investigate the viability of
hadronic emission models for RX J1713.7-3946. We produced a high-resolution map
of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray background corrected for HI self-absorption
and used it in the analysis of more than 5~years worth of Fermi-LAT data. We
used hydrodynamic scaling relations and a kinetic transport equation to
calculate the acceleration and propagation of cosmic-rays in SNR. We then
determined spectra of hadronic gamma-ray emission from RX J1713.7-3946,
separately for the SNR interior and the cosmic-ray precursor region of the
forward shock, and computed flux variations that would allow to test the model
with observations. We find that RX J1713.7-3946 is now detected by Fermi-LAT
with very high statistical significance, and the source morphology is best
described by that seen in the TeV band. The measured spectrum of RX
J1713.7-3946 is hard with index gamma=1.53 +/- 0.07, and the integral flux
above 500 MeV is F = (5.5 +/- 1.1)e-9 photons/cm^2/s. We demonstrate that
scenarios based on hadronic emission from the cosmic-ray precursor region are
acceptable for RX J1713.7-3946, and we predict a secular flux increase at a few
hundred GeV at the level of around 15% over 10 years, which may be detectable

platelets fixed on top, has been found to be an efficient absorber of low
frequency sound. In this work we consider the problem of sound absorption from
a perspective aimed at deriving upper bounds under different scenarios, i.e.,
whether the sound is incident from one side only or from both sides, and
whether there is a reflecting surface on the back side of the membrane. By
considering the negligible thickness of the membrane, usually on the order of a
fraction of one millimeter, we derive a relation showing that the sum of the
incoming sound waves' (complex) pressure amplitudes, averaged over the area of
the membrane, must be equal to that of the outgoing waves. By using this
relation, and without going to any details of the wave solutions, it is shown
that the maximum absorption achievable from one-side incident is 50%, while the
maximum absorption with a back reflecting surface can reach 100%. The latter
was attained by the hybridized resonances. All the results are shown to be in
excellent agreement with the experiments. This generalized perspective, when
used together with the Green function formalism, can be useful in gaining
insights and delineating the constraints on what are achievable in scatterings
and absorption by thin film structures.

complementation operators is well understood. However, it is of interest
extending such axiomatization to n-ary majority operators (MAJ-n) from both the
theoretical and practical perspective. In this work, we address this issue by
introducing a sound and complete axiomatization of MAJ-n logic. Our
axiomatization naturally includes existing majority logic systems. Based on
this general set of axioms, computer applications can now fully exploit the
expressive power of majority logic.

  methods",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dual first-order methods are powerful techniques for large-scale convex
optimization. Although an extensive research effort has been devoted to
studying their convergence properties, explicit convergence rates for the
primal iterates have only been established under global Lipschitz continuity of
the dual gradient. This is a rather restrictive assumption that does not hold
for several important classes of problems. In this paper, we demonstrate that
primal convergence rate guarantees can also be obtained when the dual gradient
is only locally Lipschitz. The class of problems that we analyze admits general
convex constraints including nonlinear inequality, linear equality, and set
constraints. As an approximate primal solution, we take the minimizer of the
Lagrangian, computed when evaluating the dual gradient. We derive error bounds
for this approximate primal solution in terms of the errors of the dual
variables, and establish convergence rates of the dual variables when the dual
problem is solved using a projected gradient or fast gradient method. By
combining these results, we show that the suboptimality and infeasibility of
the approximate primal solution at iteration $k$ are no worse than
$O(1/\sqrt{k})$ when the dual problem is solved using a projected gradient
method, and $O(1/k)$ when a fast dual gradient method is used.

tagging generates good fits to the hydrodynamical stellar density profiles of a
central Milky-Way-like galaxy and its most prominent substructure. Phase-space
diffusion processes are crucial to reshaping the distribution of stars in
infalling spheroidal systems and hence the final stellar halo. We conclude that
the success of any particular tagging scheme hinges on this diffusion being
taken into account, at a minimum by making use of `live' tagging schemes, in
which particles are regularly tagged throughout the evolution of a galaxy.

phenomenon which carries signatures of the statistics properties of the
particles, such as bunching or anti-bunching. In presence of particular
symmetries, interference effects take place with high visibility, one of the
simplest cases being the suppression of coincident detection in the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. Tichy et al. recently demonstrated a simple sufficient
criterion for the suppression of output events in the more general case of
Fourier multi-port beam splitters. Here we study the case in which $2^q$
particles (either bosonic or fermionic) are injected simultaneously in
different ports of a Sylvester interferometer with $2^p \geq 2^q$ modes. In
particular, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion for a significant
fraction of output states to be suppressed, for specific input configurations.
This may find application in assessing the indistinguishability of multiple
single photon sources and in the validation of boson sampling machines.

Planck mass, where the radiated energy is comparable to the black hole's mass.
And also, it has been argued that there would be a ""wormhole-like"" structure,
known as ""space-time foam"", due to large fluctuations below the Planck length.
In this paper, as an explicit example, we consider an exact classical solution
which represents nicely those two properties in a recently proposed quantum
gravity model based on different scaling dimensions between space and time
coordinates. The solution, called ""Black Wormhole"", consists of two different
states, depending on its mass M and an IR parameter omega: For the black hole
state, a non-traversable wormhole occupies the interior region of the black
hole around the singularity at the origin, whereas for the wormhole state, the
interior wormhole is exposed to an outside observer as the black hole horizon
is disappeared from evaporation. The black hole state becomes thermodynamically
stable as it approaches to the merge point where the interior wormhole throat
and the black hole horizon merges, and the Hawking temperature vanishes at the
exact merge point. This solution suggests the ""Generalized Cosmic Censorship""
by the existence of a wormhole-like structure which protects the naked
singularity even after the black hole evaporation. One could understand the
would-be wormholes inside the black hole horizon as the results of microscopic
wormholes created by ""negative"" energy quanta which have entered the black hole
horizon in Hawking radiation processes: The quantum black hole could be a
wormhole factory. It is found that this speculative picture may be consistent
with the recent ""ER=EPR"" proposal for resolving the recent black hole
entanglement debates.

the one dimensional system described by the $N=2, d=1$ supersymmetric action
for two particles in which one of $N=1$ supersymmetries is spontaneously
broken. Using the nonlinear realization approach we reconsider the system in
the basis where only one superfield has the Goldstone nature while the second
superfield can be treated as the matter one, being invariant under
transformations of the spontaneously broken $N=1$ supersymmetry. We establish
the transformations relating the two selected FPS-like cases with our more
general one, and find the field redefinitions which relate these two cases.
Thus we demonstrate, at least in one dimension, that the only difference
between two FPS cases lies in the different choice of the actions, while the
supermultiplets specified by the FPS-like constraints are really the same.
Going further with the nonlinear realization approach, we construct the most
general action for the system of two $N=1$ superfields possessing one
additional hidden spontaneously broken $N=1$ supersymmetry. The constructed
action contains two arbitrary functions and reduces to the FPS actions upon
specification of these functions. Unfortunately, the exact form of these
functions corresponding to FPS actions is not very informative and gives no
explanation on why the FPS cases are selected.

magnetic drift tangential to a flux surface is usually ignored in order to keep
the phase-space volume conservation. In this paper, effect of the tangential
magnetic drift on the local neoclassical transport are investigated. To retain
the effect of the tangential magnetic drift in the local treatment of
neoclassical transport, a new local formulation for the drift kinetic
simulation is developed. The compressibility of the phase-space volume caused
by the tangential magnetic drift is regarded as a source term for the drift
kinetic equation, which is solved by using a two-weight $\delta f$ Monte Carlo
method for non-Hamiltonian system [G.~Hu and J.~A.~Krommes, Phys. Plasmas $\rm
\textbf{1}$, 863 (1994)]. It is demonstrated that the effect of the drift is
negligible for the neoclassical transport in tokamaks. In non-axisymmetric
systems, however, the tangential magnetic drift substantially changes the
dependence of the neoclassical transport on the radial electric field $E_{\rm
r}$. The peaked behavior of the neoclassical radial fluxes around $E_{\rm r} =
0$ observed in conventional local neoclassical transport simulations is removed
by taking the tangential magnetic drift into account.

Jaynes-Cummings model, in the Rabi model the absorption and emission processes
do not need to satisfy energy conservation and the usual rotating wave
approximation (RWA) breaks down. As a result, the atom-field dynamics in the
Hilbert space splits into two independent parity chains, exhibiting a
collapse-revival pattern and exact periodic dynamics in the limit of degenerate
atomic levels. Here we introduce a mixed Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model by
considering a three-level atom interacting with two quantized bosonic fields,
in which the RWA is made for one transition (with a weak atom-field coupling)
but not for the other one (with an ultrastrong atom-field coupling). As a
result, we show that the field in the weak coupled atomic transition can be
used as a tool to control the atom-field dynamics of the other (strong coupled)
transition, thus realizing an effective two-level quantum Rabi model with a
controllable field. In particular, a periodic temporal dynamics of the
atom-field state can be realized by appropriate tuning of the weak control
field, even for non-degenerate atomic levels. A photonic simulator of the mixed
Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model, based on light transport in evanescently-coupled

singular potential, building on previous work by Ball and Majumdar. The
singular potential is a function of the admissible statistical averages of
probability distributions on a state space, defined so that it corresponds to
the maximum possible entropy given known observed statistical averages,
although non-classical entropy-like objective functions will also be
considered. First the set of admissible moments must be established, and under
the conditions presented in this work the set is open, bounded and convex
allowing a description in terms of supporting hyperplanes, which provides
estimates on the development of singularities for related probability
distributions. Under appropriate conditions it is shown that the singular
potential is strictly convex, as differentiable as the microscopic entropy and
blows up uniformly as the macroscopic variable tends to the boundary of the set
of admissible moments. Applications of the singular potential are then
discussed, and particular consideration will be given to certain free-energy
functionals typical in mean-field theory, demonstrating an equivalence between
certain microscopic and macroscopic free-energy functionals. This allows
statements about L^1-local minimisers of Onsager's free energy to be obtained
which cannot be given by two-sided variations, and overcomes the need to ensure
local minimisers are bounded away from zero and infinity before taking bounded
variations. The analysis also permits the definition of a dual order parameter
for which Onsager's free energy allows an explicit representation. Also the
difficulties in approximating the singular potential by everywhere defined
functions, in particular by polynomials, are addressed with examples
demonstrating the failure of the Taylor approximation to preserve shape

a slow nonlinear Rutherford evolution, whereas larger perturbations can lead to

  Results: Strong $M1$ transitions between the lowest-lying $3^-$ and $4^+$
states were observed, providing evidence for a one-phonon mixed-symmetry
character of the $3^{(-)}_2$ and $4^+_2$ states.
  Conclusions: $sdg$-IBM-2 calculations were performed for $^{96}$Ru. The
results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, pointing out a
one-phonon hexadecapole mixed-symmetry character of the $4^+_2$ state. The
$\big< 3^-_1||M1||3^{(-)}_2\big>$ matrix element is found to scale with the
$<2^+_{\mathrm{s}}||M1||2^+_{\mathrm{ms}}>$ matrix element.

step in understanding the mechanics of molecular structure, protein folding,
and enzyme function and performance. In such macromolecular settings, dynamic
single-molecule force spectroscopy (DFS) has been used to distort bonds. The
resulting responses, in the form of rupture forces, work applied, and
trajectories of displacements, have been used to reconstruct bond potentials.
Such approaches often rely on simple parameterizations of one-dimensional bond
potentials, assumptions on equilibrium starting states, and/or large amounts of
trajectory data. Parametric approaches typically fail at inferring
complex-shaped bond potentials with multiple minima, while piecewise estimation
may not guarantee smooth results with the appropriate behavior at large
distances. Existing techniques, particularly those based on work theorems, also
do not address spatial variations in the diffusivity that may arise from
spatially inhomogeneous coupling to other degrees of freedom in the
macromolecule, thereby presenting an incomplete picture of the overall bond
dynamics. To solve these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive
empirical Bayesian approach that incorporates data and regularization terms
directly into a path integral. All experiemental and statistical parameters in
our method are estimated empirically directly from the data. Upon testing our
method on simulated data, our regularized approach requires fewer data and
allows simultaneous inference of both complex bond potentials and diffusivity
profiles.

atomic medium with strong optical non-linearity induced by Rydberg-Rydberg van
der Waals interactions. Atoms are driven on a two-photon transition from their
ground state to a Rydberg level via an intermediate state by the combination of
a weak signal field and a strong control beam. By using a perturbative
approach, we get analytic results which remain valid in the regime of weak
feeding fields, even when the intermediate state becomes resonant. Therefore
they allow us to investigate quantitatively new features associated with the
resonant behaviour of the system. We also propose an effective non-linear
three-boson model of the system which, in addition to leading to the same
analytic results as the original problem, sheds light on the physical processes
at work in the system.

opinions. We present two versions of the model, one with discrete opinions

implement peer-to-peer systems. Chord peers find other peers, and access their
data, through a ring-shaped pointer structure in a large identifier space.
Despite claims of proven correctness, i.e., eventual reachability, previous
work has shown that the Chord ring-maintenance protocol is not correct under
its original operating assumptions. It has not, however, discovered whether
Chord could be made correct with reasonable operating assumptions. The
contribution of this paper is to provide the first specification of correct
operations and initialization for Chord, an inductive invariant that is
necessary and sufficient to support a proof of correctness, and the proof
itself. Most of the proof is carried out by automated analysis of an Alloy
model. The inductive invariant reflects the fact that a Chord network must have
a minimum ring size (the minimum being the length of successor lists plus one)
to be correct. The invariant relies on an assumption that there is a stable
base, of the minimum size, of permanent ring members. Because a stable base has
only a few members and a Chord network can have millions, we learn that the
obstacles to provable correctness are anomalies in small networks, and that a
stable base need not be maintained once a Chord network grows large.

is achieved consistently by two complementary methods implemented within the
framework of the configuration-interaction singles (CIS) theory. The first
method accesses the resonance states by diagonalizing the many-electron
Hamiltonian using the smooth exterior complex scaling technique. The second
method involves a new application of the Gabor analysis to wave-packet
dynamics. We identify one resonance at an excitation energy of 74 eV with a
lifetime of 27 as, and the second at 107 eV with a lifetime of 11 as. Our work
provides a deeper understanding of the nature of the resonances associated with
the GDR: a group of close-lying intrachannel resonances splits into two
far-separated resonances through interchannel couplings involving the 4d
electrons. The CIS approach allows a transparent interpretation of the two
resonances as new collective modes. Due to the strong entanglement between the
excited electron and the ionic core, the resonance wave functions are not
dominated by any single particle-hole state. This gives rise to plasma-like
collective oscillations of the 4d shell as a whole.

lossy layer, but only in a narrow frequency band, as follows from the causality
principle. On the other hand, it appears that there are no fundamental
limitations on broadband matching of thin absorbing layers. However, known thin
absorbers produce significant reflections outside of the resonant absorption
band. In this paper we explore possibilities to realize a thin absorbing layer
which produces no reflected waves in a very wide frequency range, while the
transmission coefficient has a narrow peak of full absorption. Here we show,
both theoretically and experimentally, that a wide-band-matched thin resonant
absorber, invisible in reflection, can be realized if one and the same resonant
mode of the absorbing array unit cells is utilized to create both electric and
magnetic responses. We test this concept using chiral particles in each unit
cells, arranged in a periodic planar racemic array, utilizing chirality
coupling in each unit cell but compensating the field coupling at the
macroscopic level. We prove that the concept and the proposed realization
approach also can be used to create non-reflecting layers for full control of
transmitted fields. Our results can have a broad range of potential
applications over the entire electromagnetic spectrum including, for example,
perfect ultra-compact wave filters and selective multi-frequency sensors.

their ability to treat a wide variety of complex statistical problems. However,
current algorithms are strongly limited by their sampling variance, which
scales proportionate to 1/N_S for N_S samples. In this paper, we obtain a new
class of variance reduction methods for treating stochastic equations, called
parallel optimized sampling. The objective of parallel optimized sampling is to
reduce the sampling variance in the observables of an ensemble of stochastic
trajectories. This is achieved through calculating a finite set of observables
- typically statistical moments - in parallel, and minimizing the errors
compared to known values. The algorithm is both numerically efficient and
unbiased. Importantly, it does not increase the errors in higher order moments,
and generally reduces such errors as well. The same procedure is applied both
to initial ensembles and to changes in a finite time-step. Results of these
methods show that errors in initially optimized moments can be reduced to the
machine precision level, typically around 10^(-16) in current hardware. For
nonlinear stochastic equations, sampled moment errors during time-evolution are
larger than this, due to error propagation effects. Even so, we provide
evidence for error reductions of up to two orders of magnitude in a nonlinear
equation example, for low order moments, which is a large practical benefit.
The sampling variance typically scales as 1/N_S, but with the advantage of a
very much smaller prefactor than for standard, non-optimized methods.

dimensions in presence of a boundary. We demonstrate that it is possible to
preserve half the supersymmetry of the original theory by suitably modifying it
in presence of a boundary. This is done by adding new boundary terms to the
original action, such that the supersymmetric variation of the new terms
exactly cancels the boundary terms generated by the supersymmetric
transformation of the original bulk action. We also analyze the boundary
projections of such supercharges used in such a theory. We study
super-Yang-Mills theories in presence of a boundary using these results.
Finally, we study the Born-Infeld action in presence of a boundary. We analyse
the boundary effects for the Born-Infeld action coupled to a background dilaton
and an axion field. We also analyse the boundary effects for an non-abelian
Born-Infeld action. We explicitly construct the actions for these systems in
presence of a boundary. This action preserves half of the original
supersymmetry.
