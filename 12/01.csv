situation where an acoustically permeable interface is embedded in the

standard one, weakly enforces the impedance conditions for transmission through
the interface. As opposed to a standard finite-element discretization of the
problem, our method seamlessly handles a complex-valued impedance function $Z$
that is allowed to vanish. In the case of a vanishing impedance, the proposed
method reduces to the classic Nitsche method to weakly enforce continuity over
the interface. We show stability of the method, in terms of a discrete
G{\aa}rding inequality, for a quite general class of surface impedance
functions, provided that possible surface waves are sufficiently resolved by
the mesh. Moreover, we prove an a priori error estimate under the assumption
that the absolute value of the impedance is bounded away from zero almost
everywhere. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the method for
a number of test cases in 2D and 3D with different interface conditions.

thermodynamic equilibrium photospheric+wind models, of the B0 Ia-supergiant:
$\epsilon$~Ori. The aim is to test the consistency of physical parameters, such
as the mass-loss rate and CNO abundances, derived from different spectral
bands. The derived mass-loss rate is
$\dot{M}/\sqrt{f_\infty}\sim$1.6$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ where
$f_\infty$ is the volume filling factor. However, the S IV
$\lambda\lambda$1062,1073 profiles are too strong in the models; to fit the
observed profiles it is necessary to use $f_\infty<$0.01. This value is a
factor of 5 to 10 lower than inferred from other diagnostics, and implies
$\dot{M} \lesssim1 \times 10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discrepancy could
be related to porosity-vorosity effects or a problem with the ionization of
sulfur in the wind. To fit the UV profiles of N V and O VI it was necessary to
include emission from an interclump medium with a density contrast
($\rho_{cl}/\rho_{ICM}$) of $\sim$100. X-ray emission in H-He like and Fe L
lines was modeled using four plasma components located within the wind. We
derive plasma temperatures from $1 \times 10^{6}$ to $7\times 10^{6}$ K, with
lower temperatures starting in the outer regions (R$_0\sim$3-6 R$_*$), and a
hot component starting closer to the star (R$_0\lesssim$2.9 R$_*$). From X-ray
line profiles we infer $\dot{M} <\, 4.9\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The
X-ray spectrum ($\geq$0.1 kev) yields an X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}\sim
2.0\times10^{-7} L_{\rm bol}$, consistent with the superion line profiles.
X-ray abundances are in agreement with those derived from the UV and optical
analysis: $\epsilon$ Ori is slightly enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in
carbon and oxygen, evidence for CNO processed material.

Quasi-periodic variability has been observed in a number of X-ray
binaries harboring black hole candidates. In general relativity, black holes
are uniquely described by the Kerr metric and, according to the cosmic
censorship conjecture, curvature singularities always have to be clothed by an
event horizon. Aims. In this paper, we study the effect of an external magnetic
field on the observed light curves of orbiting hot spots in thin accretion
discs around Kerr black holes and naked singularities. Methods. We employ a
ray-tracing algorithm to calculate the light curves and power spectra of such
hot spots as seen by a distant observer for uniform and dipolar magnetic field
configurations assuming a weak coupling between the magnetic field and the disc
matter. Results. We show that the presence of an external dipolar magnetic
field leads to potentially observable modifications of these signals for both
Kerr black holes and naked singularities, while an external uniform magnetic
field has practically no effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the
emission from a hot spot orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit of a
naked singularity in a dipolar magnetic field can be significantly harder than
the emission of the same hot spot in the absence of such a magnetic field.
Conclusions. The comparison of our model with observational data may allow us
study the geometry of magnetic fields around compact objects and to test the
cosmic censorship conjecture in conjunction with other observables such as
thermal continuum spectra and iron line profiles.

disk, as it has the largest imaged gap in any protoplanetary disk: the gas is
cleared from 30 to 90 AU. The HD142527 system is also unique in that it has a
stellar companion with a small mass compared to the mass of the primary star.
This factor of ~20 in mass ratio between the two objects makes this binary
system different from any other YSO. The HD142527 system could therefore
provide a valuable test bed. This low-mass stellar object may be responsible
for both the gap and dust trapping observed by ALMA at longer distances. We
observed this system with the NACO and GPI instruments using the aperture
masking technique. Aperture masking is ideal for providing high dynamic range
even at very small angular separations. We present the spectral energy
distribution for HD142527A and B. Brightness of the companion is now known from
the R band up to the M' band. We also followed the orbital motion of HD 142527B
over a period of more than two years. The SED of the companion is compatible
with a T=3000+/-100K object in addition to a 1700K blackbody environment
(likely a circus-secondary disk). From evolution models, we find that it is
compatible with an object of mass 0.13+/-0.03Msun, radius 0.90+/-0.15Rsun, and
age $1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.75}$Myr. This age is significantly younger than the age
previously estimated for HD142527A. Computations to constrain the orbital
parameters found a semi major axis of $140^{+120}_{-70}$mas, an eccentricity of
0.5+/-0.2, an inclination of 125+/-15 degrees, and a position angle of the
right ascending node of -5+/-40 degrees. Inclination and position angle of the
ascending node are in agreement with an orbit coplanar with the inner disk, not
coplanar with the outer disk. Despite its high eccentricity, it is unlikely
that HD142527B is responsible for truncating the inner edge of the outer disk.

cycle detection is a restricted form of coinductive proof, in which the atomic

  This paper introduces a heuristic method for obtaining richer coinductive

extremely complicated to obtain. Thermal modeling can provide good results, but
accurate absolute magnitudes are needed to constrain the thermal models and
derive diameters and geometric albedos. The absolute magnitude, Hv, is defined
as the magnitude of the object reduced to unit helio- and geocentric distances
and a zero solar phase angle and is determined using phase curves. Phase
coefficients can also be obtained from phase curves. These are related to
surface properties, yet not many are known.
  Aims: Our objective is to measure accurate V band absolute magnitudes and
phase coefficients for a sample of trans-Neptunian objects, many of which have
been observed, and modeled, within the 'TNOs are cool' program, one of Herschel
Space Observatory key projects.
  Methods: We observed 56 objects using the V and R filters. These data, along
with those available in the literature, were used to obtain phase curves and
measure V band absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients by assuming a linear
trend of the phase curves and considering magnitude variability due to
rotational light-curve.
  Results: We obtained 237 new magnitudes for the 56 objects, six of them with
no reported previous measurements. Including the data from the literature we
report a total of 110 absolute magnitudes with their respective phase
coefficients. The average value of Hv is 6.39, bracketed by a minimum of 14.60
and a maximum of -1.12. In the case of the phase coefficients we report 0.10
mag per degree as the median value and a very large dispersion, ranging from
-0.88 up tp 1.35 mag per degree.

between very high-energy neutrino candidates detected by IceCube and the
highest-energy cosmic rays measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the
Telescope Array. We first consider samples of cascade neutrino events and of
high-energy neutrino-induced muon tracks, which provided evidence for a
neutrino flux of astrophysical origin, and study their cross-correlation with
the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) samples as a function of angular
separation. We also study their possible directional correlations using a
likelihood method stacking the neutrino arrival directions and adopting
different assumptions on the size of the UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally,
we perform another likelihood analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using
a sample of through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source
searches with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at
discovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed. The smallest of
the p-values comes from the search for correlation between UHECRs with IceCube
high-energy cascades, a result that should continue to be monitored.

source of information for the long--standing investigation of new physics
beyond the Standard Model. The rather recent measurement of the third mixing
angle $\theta_{13}$ in the standard mixing oscillation scenario encourages the
pursuit of what is still missing: the size of any leptonic CP violation,
absolute neutrino masses and the characteristic nature of the neutrino. Several
projects are currently running and they are providing impressive results. In
this review, the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations that results from the
last two decades of investigations is reviewed, with emphasis on our current
knowledge and on what lesson can be taken from the past. We then present a
critical discussion of current studies on the mass ordering and what might be
expected from future results. Our conclusion is that decisions determining the
next generation of experiments and investigations have to be strictly based on
the findings of the current generation of experiment. In this sense it would be
wise to wait a few years before taking decisions on the future projects. In the
meantime, since no direct path forward is evident for the future projects, the
community must be committed to their careful evaluation.

When taking the coupling parameter to be dependent on the size of the product

become strongly coupled and we obtain a new hard edge limiting kernel. It
interpolates between the classical Bessel-kernel describing the hard edge
scaling limit of the Laguerre ensemble of a single matrix, and the Meijer

bright loops as an integral part of a larger 3-D magnetic structure comprised
of the entire magnetic arcade. We demonstrate that magnetic arcades within the
solar corona can trap MHD fast waves in a 3-D waveguide. This is accomplished
through the construction of a cylindrically symmetric model of a magnetic
arcade with a potential magnetic field. For a magnetically dominated plasma, we
derive a governing equation for MHD fast waves and from this equation we show
that the magnetic arcade forms a 3-D waveguide if the Alfv\'en speed increases
monotonically beyond a fiducial radius. Both magnetic pressure and tension act
as restoring forces, instead of just tension as is generally assumed in 1-D
models. Since magnetic pressure plays an important role, the eigenmodes involve
propagation both parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Using an
analytic solution, we derive the specific eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions
for an arcade possessing a discontinuous density profile. The discontinuity
separates a diffuse cylindrical cavity and an overlying shell of denser plasma
that corresponds to the bright loops. We emphasize that all of the
eigenfunctions have a discontinuous axial velocity at the density interface;
hence, the interface can give rise to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
Further, we find that all modes have elliptical polarization with the degree of
polarization changing with height. However, depending on the line of sight,
only one polarization may be clearly visible.

introduce bialgebroid categories over $\C$ and a cohomology over a symmetric
bialgebroid category. This cohomology turns out to be a generalization of the
one we developed in a previous paper and moreover, an analogous
Villamayor-Zelinsky sequence exists in this setting. In this context, for a

possible observational biases, such as the presence of anisotropic sky cuts and
the non-uniform exposure of Planck's instrumentation, ensembles of Monte Carlo
realisations are produced in order to assess the significance of our results.
When these observational effects are properly taken into account, we find
neither evidence for preferred directions in the sky nor signs of large-angle

therefore, in good concordance with the fundamental hypothesis of large-angle
isotropy of cosmic objects.

speed based on deterministic numerical weather predictions and historical

combines multiple sources of past physical model outputs and measurements along
with model predictions in order to produce a probabilistic wind speed forecast
within the prediction window. We illustrate this strategy on a ground wind
speed forecast for several months in 2012 for a region near the Great Lakes in
the United States. The results show that the prediction is improved in the
mean-squared sense relative to the numerical forecasts as well as in
probabilistic scores. Moreover, the samples are shown to produce realistic wind
scenarios based on the sample spectrum.

optimization problems that also have black-box constraints. Of particular
interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in
which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated
independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the
constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an
acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the
individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and
call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an
approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares
favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic
and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix
of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require
balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the
actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality
approach and develop partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against
speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial
and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of
PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are
efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an
effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified
solution for constrained Bayesian optimization.

  2012, which was earlier than the publication in the New Astronomy",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE) spectrum has strong iron emission
lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 7.0~keV, each corresponding to the neutral (or
low-ionized), He-like, and H-like iron ions. The 6.4~keV fluorescence line is
due to irradiation of neutral (or low ionized) material (iron) by hard X-ray
sources, indicating uniform presence of the cold matter in the Galactic plane.
In order to resolve origin of the cold fluorescent matter, we examined the
contribution of the 6.4~keV line emission from white dwarf surfaces in the hard
X-ray emitting symbiotic stars (hSSs) and magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs)
to the GRXE. In our spectral analysis of 4~hSSs and 19~mCVs observed with
Suzaku, we were able to resolve the three iron emission lines. We found that
the equivalent-widths (EWs) of the 6.4~keV lines of hSSs are systematically
higher than those of mCVs, such that the average EWs of hSSs and mCVs are
$179_{-11}^{+46}$~eV and $93_{-3}^{+20}$~eV, respectively. The EW of hSSs
compares favorably with the typical EWs of the 6.4~keV line in the GRXE of
90--300~eV depending on Galactic positions. Average 6.4~keV line luminosities
of the hSSs and mCVs are $9.2\times 10^{39}$ and $1.6\times
10^{39}$~photons~s$^{-1}$, respectively, indicating that hSSs are intrinsically
more efficient 6.4~keV line emitters than mCVs. We compare expected
contribution of the 6.4 keV lines from mCVs with the observed GRXE 6.4 keV line
flux in the direction of $(l,b) \approx (28.5\arcdeg, 0\arcdeg$). We conclude
that almost all the 6.4 keV line flux in GRXE may be explained by mCVs within
current undertainties of the stellar number densities, while contribution from
hSSs may not be negligible.

streamed by our sensory organs. Because such analysis begins with
dimensionality reduction, modelling early sensory processing requires
biologically plausible online dimensionality reduction algorithms. Recently, we
derived such an algorithm, termed similarity matching, from a Multidimensional
Scaling (MDS) objective function. However, in the existing algorithm, the
number of output dimensions is set a priori by the number of output neurons and
cannot be changed. Because the number of informative dimensions in sensory
inputs is variable there is a need for adaptive dimensionality reduction. Here,
we derive biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithms which
adapt the number of output dimensions to the eigenspectrum of the input
covariance matrix. We formulate three objective functions which, in the offline
setting, are optimized by the projections of the input dataset onto its
principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix.
In turn, the output eigenvalues are computed as i) soft-thresholded, ii)
hard-thresholded, iii) equalized thresholded eigenvalues of the input
covariance matrix. In the online setting, we derive the three corresponding
adaptive algorithms and map them onto the dynamics of neuronal activity in
networks with biologically plausible local learning rules. Remarkably, in the
last two networks, neurons are divided into two classes which we identify with
principal neurons and interneurons in biological circuits.

lower dimensional space to facilitate its analysis. In the Euclidean setting,
one fundamental technique for dimension reduction is to apply a random linear
map to the data. This dimension reduction procedure succeeds when it preserves
certain geometric features of the set.
  The question is how large the embedding dimension must be to ensure that
randomized dimension reduction succeeds with high probability.
  This paper studies a natural family of randomized dimension reduction maps
and a large class of data sets. It proves that there is a phase transition in
the success probability of the dimension reduction map as the embedding
dimension increases. For a given data set, the location of the phase transition
is the same for all maps in this family. Furthermore, each map has the same
stability properties, as quantified through the restricted minimum singular
value. These results can be viewed as new universality laws in high-dimensional
stochastic geometry.
  Universality laws for randomized dimension reduction have many applications
in applied mathematics, signal processing, and statistics. They yield design
principles for numerical linear algebra algorithms, for compressed sensing
measurement ensembles, and for random linear codes. Furthermore, these results
have implications for the performance of statistical estimation methods under a
large class of random experimental designs.

  (-) $q=2$ and $e\geq d+4$,
  (-) $q\geq 3$ and $e\geq d+3$.
  Thus, the following cases have been left unsettled:
  (-) $q=2$ and $e\in \{d,d+1,d+2,d+3\}$,
  (-) $q\geq 3$ and $e\in \{d,d+1,d+2\}$.
  In this work, we show that the graph of bilinear $(d\times d)$-forms over the
binary field, where $d\geq 3$, is characterized by its intersection array. In
doing so, we also classify locally grid graphs whose $\mu$-graphs are hexagons
and the intersection numbers $b_i,c_i$ are well-defined for all $i=0,1,2$.

problems. To mitigate the potential harms of model misspecification, various
forms of distributionally robust optimization have been applied. Although many
of these methodologies suffer from the problem of time-inconsistency, the work
of Klabjan et al. established a general time-consistent framework for such
problems by connecting to the literature on robust Markov decision processes.
  Motivated by the fact that many forecasting models exhibit special structure,
as well as a desire to understand the impact of positing different dependency
structures, in this paper we formulate and solve a time-consistent
distributionally robust multi-stage newsvendor model which naturally unifies
and robustifies several inventory models with forecasting. In particular, many
simple models of demand forecasting have the feature that demand evolves as a
martingale. We consider a robust variant of such models, in which the sequence
of future demands may be any martingale with given mean and support. Under such
a model, past realizations of demand are naturally incorporated into the
structure of the uncertainty set going forwards.
  We explicitly compute the minimax optimal policy (and worst-case
distribution) in closed form, by combining ideas from convexity, probability,
and dynamic programming. We prove that at optimality the worst-case demand
distribution corresponds to the setting in which inventory may become obsolete,
a scenario of practical interest. To gain further insight, we prove weak
convergence (as the time horizon grows large) to a simple and intuitive
process. We also compare to the analogous setting in which demand is
independent across periods (analyzed previously by Shapiro), and identify
interesting differences between these models, in the spirit of the price of
correlations studied by Agrawal et al.

integrates a sparsity-driven 3D geometric prior and temporal smoothness. In the

predict the uncertainty maps of the 2D joint locations. The 3D pose estimates
are realized via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm over the entire

conveniently marginalized out during inference. Empirical evaluation on the

to construct deterministic feedback coding schemes (with double exponential
decaying error probability). We next propose an asymptotic capacity-achieving
upper bounds, which can be numerically evaluated by solving finite dimensional
dual optimizations. From the filters that achieve upper bounds, we derive
feasible filters which lead to a sequence of lower bounds. Thus, from the lower
bound filters we obtain communication systems that achieve the lower bound
rate. Extensive examples show the sequence of lower bounds is asymptotic

vice-versa over certain wavelength regions, in particular, over the Hubble

also find that patchy cloud coverage exhibits a signature that is different
from uniform global clouds. Furthermore, we explain analytically why the
""patchy cloud-high mean molecular weight"" degeneracy exists. We also explore
the degeneracy of non-uniform cloud coverage in atmospheric retrievals on both
synthetic and real planets. We find from retrievals on a synthetic solar
composition hot Jupiter with patchy clouds and a cloud free high mean molecular
weight warm Neptune, that both cloud free high mean molecular weight
atmospheres and partially cloudy atmospheres can explain the data equally well.
Another key find is that the HST WFC3 transit transmission spectra of two well
observed objects, the hot Jupiter HD189733b and the warm Neptune HAT-P-11b, can
be explained well by solar composition atmospheres with patchy clouds without
the need to invoke high mean molecular weight or global clouds. The degeneracy
between high molecular weight and solar composition partially cloudy
atmospheres can be broken by observing the molecular Rayleigh scattering
differences between the two. Furthermore, the signature of partially cloudy
limbs also appears as a $\sim$100 ppm residual in the ingress and egress of the

wide quantum well. The results allowed us to find the complex conductance,
$\sigma(\omega)$, of the heterostructure for different frequencies,
temperatures and magnetic fields near filling factors $\nu=1, 2$. Observed
behavior of $\sigma(\omega)$ versus magnetic field outside close vicinities of
integer fillings reveals an oscillation pattern indicative of the rich
fractional quantum Hall effect. Our result is that in very close vicinities of
integer filling factors the AC response of a high-mobility two-dimensional
structures behaves as that of a two-dimensional system of localized electrons.
Namely, both real and imaginary parts of the complex AC conductance at low
temperatures agree with the predictions for the two-site model for a
two-dimensional hopping system. Another result is the specific temperature
dependences of $\sigma(\omega)$, which are extremely sensitive to the filling
factor value. These dependences indicate a sharp crossover between the
localized modes and a pinned Wigner crystal.

particle physics, nuclear physics and cosmology. However, the lowest-order
contribution, arising at one loop, has proved difficult to calculate
unambiguously. We show that this thermal correction may be calculated for
charged scalars using the worldline formalism, where each term in the decay
rate is associated with a worldline instanton. We calculate all
finite-temperature worldline instantons, their actions and fluctuations
prefactors, thus determining the complete one-loop decay rate at finite
temperature. The thermal contribution to the decay rate becomes nonzero at a
threshold temperature $T=eE/2m$, above which it dominates the zero temperature
result. This is the lowest of an infinite set of thresholds at $T=neE/2m$. The
decay rate is singular at each threshold as a consequence of the failure of the
quadratic approximation to the worldline path integral. We argue that that
higher-order effects will make the decay rates finite everywhere, and model
those effects by the inclusion of hard thermal loop damping rates. We also
demonstrate that the formalism developed here generalizes to the case of
finite-temperature pair production in inhomogeneous fields.

are induced by Bragg scattering mechanisms, their key feature is that the band
gap size and frequency range can be controlled and broadened through local
resonances, which is linked to changes in the lattice geometry. We demonstrate
these principles experimentally, using novel additive manufacturing methods,

reasonable to suspect that similar systems of moons might exist around giant
extrasolar planets. Furthermore, a significant population of such planets is
known to reside at distances of several Astronomical Units (AU), leading to
speculation that some moons thereof might support liquid water on their
surfaces. However, giant planets are thought to undergo inward migration within
their natal protoplanetary disks, suggesting that gas giants currently
occupying their host star's habitable zone formed further out. Here we show
that when a moon-hosting planet undergoes inward migration, dynamical
interactions may naturally destroy the moon through capture into a so-called
""evection resonance."" Within this resonance, the lunar orbit's eccentricity
grows until the moon eventually collides with the planet. Our work suggests
that moons orbiting within about 10 planetary radii are susceptible to this
mechanism, with the exact number dependent upon the planetary mass, oblateness
and physical size. Whether moons survive or not is critically related to where
the planet began its inward migration as well as the character of inter-lunar
perturbations. For example, a Jupiter-like planet currently residing at 1AU
could lose moons if it formed beyond 5AU. Cumulatively, we suggest that an
observational census of exomoons could potentially inform us on the extent of
inward planetary migration, for which no reliable observational proxy currently

Systemic redshifts based on the peak of the [OIII]5007 line reveal that
redshift estimates from the rest-frame UV broad emission lines (mostly MgII)
are intrinsically uncertain by ~ 200 km/s (measurement errors accounted for).
The overall full-width-at-half-maximum of the narrow [OIII] line is ~ 1000 km/s
on average. A significant fraction of the total [OIII] flux (~ 40%) is in a
blueshifted wing component with a median velocity offset of ~ 700 km/s,
indicative of ionized outflows within a few kpc from the nucleus; we do not
find evidence of significant [OIII] flux beyond ~ 10 kpc in our slit
spectroscopy. The [OIII] line is noticeably more asymmetric and weaker than
that in typical less luminous low-z quasars. However, when matched in quasar
continuum luminosity, low-z quasars have similar [OIII] profiles and strengths
as these high-z systems. Therefore the exceptionally large width and
blueshifted wing, and the relatively weak strength of [OIII] in high-z luminous
quasars are mostly a luminosity effect rather than redshift evolution. The
Hbeta-[OIII] region of these high-z quasars displays a similar spectral
diversity and Eigenvector 1 correlations with anti-correlated [OIII] and
optical FeII strengths, as seen in low-z quasars; but the average broad Hbeta
width is larger by 25% than typical low-z quasars, indicating more massive
black holes in these high-z systems. These results highlight the importance of
understanding [OIII] emission in the general context of quasar parameter space
in order to understand quasar feedback in the form of [OIII] outflows. The

bulge index, defined to be larger for larger bulge/disk ratio, in spiral
galaxies with similar luminosities in the Galaxy Zoo 2 of SDSS and the number

  In the standard cold or warm dark-matter cosmological models the number of
satellite galaxies correlates with the circular velocity of the dark matter
host halo. In generalized-gravity models without cold or warm dark matter such
a correlation does not exist, because host galaxies cannot capture in-falling
dwarf galaxies due to the absence of dark-matter-induced dynamical friction.
However, in such models a correlation is expected to exist between the bulge
mass and the number of satellite galaxies, because bulges and tidal-dwarf
satellite galaxies form in encounters between host galaxies. This is not
predicted by dark matter models in which bulge mass and the number of
satellites are a priori uncorrelated because higher bulge/disk ratios do not
imply higher dark/luminous ratios. Hence, our correlation reproduces the
prediction of scenarios without dark matter, whereas an explanation is not
found readily from the a priori predictions of the standard scenario with dark
matter. Further research is needed to explore whether some application of the
standard theory may explain this correlation.

the AdS bulk dual of the trace of the boson mass matrix (which is not a chiral

the existence of non-stringy supergravity flows describing theories where this

sum of the squares of the boson masses but rather its departure from the trace
of the square of the fermion mass matrix. Hence, asymptotically-AdS flows can
only describe holographically theories where the sums of the squares of the

weakly-coupled result that only such theories can have a conformal UV fixed

$M_*<10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$ and the median specific star formation rates (sSFRs)

predicted by the three models closely follows the mass assembly history of dark
matter haloes. In both EAGLE and L-GALAXIES there are more central passive
galaxies with $M_*<10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ than in L-GALAXIES. This difference is
related to galaxies that have entered and then left a larger halo and which are
treated as satellites in GALFORM. In the range $0<z<1$, the slope of the
evolution of the star formation rate density in EAGLE is a factor of $\approx
1.5$ steeper than for the two SA models. The median sizes for galaxies with
$M_*>10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ differ in some instances by an order of magnitude,
while the stellar mass-size relation in EAGLE is a factor of $\approx 2$
tighter than for the two SA models. Our results suggest the need for a revision
of how SA models treat the effect of baryonic self-gravity on the underlying
dark matter. The treatment of gas flows in the models needs to be revised based
on detailed comparison with observations to understand in particular the

within ~2 pc of the massive OB type stars in the sigma Orionis cluster. At an
Lbol ~ 0.1 Lsun, HH 1158 is the lowest luminosity irradiated HH jet identified
to date in any cluster. Results from the analysis of high-resolution optical
spectra indicate asymmetries in the brightness, morphology, electron density,
velocity, and the mass outflow rates for the blue and red-shifted lobes. We
constrain the position angle of the HH 1158 jet at 102+/-5 degree. The mass
outflow rate and the mean accretion rate for HH 1158 using multiple diagnostics
are estimated to be (5.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^(-10) Msun/yr and (3.0 +/- 1.0) x
10^(-10) Msun/yr, respectively. The properties for HH 1158 are notably similar
to the externally irradiated HH 444 -- HH 447 jets previously identified in
sigma Orionis. In particular, the morphology is such that the weaker jet beam
is tilted towards the massive stars, indicating a higher extent of
photo-evaporation. The high value for the Halpha/[SII] ratio is also consistent
with the ratios measured in other irradiated jets, including HH 444 -- HH 447.
The presence of an extended collimated jet that is bipolar and the evidence of
shocked emission knots make HH 1158 the first unique case of irradiated HH jets
at the very low-luminosity end, and provides an opportunity to learn the
physical properties of very faint HH jet sources.

weak/no Ly-alpha emission to have metallicities comparable to z~2 galaxies and
therefore may represent an evolved sub-population of z~5 galaxies. We find a
correlation between metallicity and dust in good agreement with local galaxies
and an inverse trend between metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR)
consistent with observations at z~2. The relation between stellar mass and
metallicity (MZ relation) is similar to z~3.5, however, there are indications
of it being slightly shallower, in particular for the young, Ly-alpha emitting
galaxies. We show that, within a ""bathtub"" approach, a shallower MZ relation is
expected in the case of a fast (exponential) build-up of stellar mass with an
e-folding time of 100-200 Myr. Due to this fast evolution, the process of dust
production and metal enrichment as a function of mass could be more stochastic

events (TDEs), in which a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black
hole (BH). These TDEs release a huge amount of radiation energy ~ 10^51-52 erg
into the circum-nuclear medium. If the medium is dusty, most of the radiation
energy will be absorbed by dust grains within ~ 1 pc from the BH and
re-radiated in the infrared. We calculate the dust emission lightcurve from a
1-D radiative transfer model, taking into account the time-dependent heating,
cooling and sublimation of dust grains. We show that the dust emission peaks at
3-10 microns and has typical luminosities ~ 10^42-43 erg/s (with sky covering

events may be from other sources. Long-term monitoring is needed to draw a firm
conclusion. We also point out two nearby TDE candidates (ASSASN-14ae and -14li)

is better described in terms of a 3-form field $C_{\mu \nu \rho}$ coupling to
the SM Higgs through its field strength $F_4$. The 4-form also couples linearly
to the relaxion, in the Kaloper-Sorbo fashion. The extremely small
relaxion-Higgs coupling arises in a see-saw fashion as $g\simeq F_4/f$, with
$f$ being the axion decay constant. We discuss constraints on this type of
constructions from membrane nucleation and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. The
latter requires the existence of membranes, whose too fast nucleation could in
principle drive the theory out of control, unless the cut-off scale is lowered.
This allows to constrain relaxion models on purely theoretical grounds. We also
discuss possible avenues to embed this structure into string theory.

the scalar top partner responsible for canceling the ultraviolet sensitivity of
the Higgs mass at one loop carries no color. As a result, bounds on naturalness
on these theories are more relaxed than in typical supersymmetric models, since
collider bounds on top partners are less stringent. Here we consider the lepton
sector of these theories. We show that a natural realization in a
five-dimensional completion requires the existence of scalar leptons with weak
scale masses and study their phenomenology. We derive bounds on the masses of
these sleptons from the LHC data at $\sqrt{s}=8~$TeV and study the sensitivity
of the $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV run for various integrated luminosities. When
supersymmetry is broken exclusively by Scherk-Schwarz boundary conditions the
sleptons are stable on collider scales. This leads to bounds on the folded
sleptons that translate into masses above $1~$TeV for the folded stops
resulting in tuning. When additional sources of supersymmetry breaking, which
may be necessary to ensure electroweak symmetry breaking, are allowed the
bounds on stops are mostly avoided. On the other hand, these terms lead to
faster slepton decays resulting in interesting signals with highly displaced

the base of the neutron star's envelope to a depth where the plasma
crystallizes into a solid crust. During an accretion outburst in an X-ray
transient, material accumulates in the envelope of the neutron star primary.
This accumulation compresses the neutron star's outer layers and induces
nuclear reactions in the ocean and crust. Accretion-driven heating raises the
ocean's temperature and increases the frequencies of g-modes in the ocean; when
accretion halts, the ocean cools and ocean g-mode frequencies decrease. If the
observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations on accreting neutron stars
are g-modes in the ocean, the observed quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies
will increase during outburst---reaching a maximum when the ocean temperature
reaches steady state --- and subsequently decrease during quiescence. For
time-averaged accretion rates during outbursts between $\langle \dot{M} \rangle
= 0.1 \textrm{--} 1.0\, \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ the predicted g-mode fundamental
$n=1$ $l=2$ frequency is between $\approx 3 \textrm{--} 7 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ for

shallow heating, such as the Z-sources MAXI J0556-332, MXB 1659-29, and XTE

quasi-periodic oscillations between $\approx 8 \textrm{--} 16\, \mathrm{Hz}$ in
these sources, or in other transients that require shallow heating, will
support a g-mode origin for the observed quasi-periodic oscillations.

of the IGR sources: IGR J14091-6108, IGR J18088-2741, and IGR J18381-0924. The

power-law with photon indices of Gamma = 0.6+/-0.4 and -0.7(+0.4)(-0.3),
respectively (90% confidence errors are given), and both have a unique near-IR

a strong iron line and a relatively low X-ray luminosity, and we argue that the
most likely source type is a Cataclysmic Variable (CV), although we do not
completely rule out the possibility of a High Mass X-ray Binary. IGR
J18088-2741 has an optical counterpart with a previously measured 6.84 hr

of a possible 800-950 s period in the Chandra light curve, which may be the
compact object spin period. We suggest that IGR J18088-2741 is also most likely
a CV. For IGR J18381-0924, the spectrum is intrinsically softer with Gamma =
1.5(+0.5)(-0.4), and it is moderately absorbed, nH = (4+/-1)e22 cm-2. There are
two near-IR sources consistent with the Chandra position, and they are both
classified as galaxies, making it likely that IGR J18381-0924 is an Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN). For the other five IGR sources, we provide lists of
nearby Chandra sources, which may be used along with further observations to

Subsequently, we describe the equivalence classes of cocycles under smooth

Finally, we derive a complete classification of the dynamics of one-frequency

as a Chern-Simons theory. In this context, a higher spin black hole corresponds
to a flat connection with suitable holonomy (smoothness) conditions which are
consistent with the properties of a generalized thermal ensemble. Building on
these ideas, we discuss a definition of black hole extremality which is
appropriate to the topological character of 3d higher spin theories. Our
definition can be phrased in terms of the Jordan class of the holonomy around a

extremality does not require supersymmetry, we exemplify its consequences in
the context of sl(3|2) + sl(3|2) Chern-Simons theory and show that, as usual,
not all extremal solutions preserve supersymmetries. Remarkably, we find in

translation-invariant local Hamiltonians in 1D. The bound is based on a
relationship between global and local gaps. The global gap is the spectral gap
of a size-$m$ chain with periodic boundary conditions, while the local gap is
that of a subchain of size $n<m$ with open boundary conditions. Knabe proved
that if the local gap is larger than the threshold value $1/(n-1)$ for some
$n>2$, then the global gap is lower bounded by a positive constant in the
thermodynamic limit $m\rightarrow \infty$. Here we improve the threshold to
$\frac{6}{n(n+1)}$, which is better (smaller) for all $n>3$ and which is
asymptotically optimal. As a corollary we establish a surprising fact about 1D
translation-invariant frustration-free systems that are gapless in the
thermodynamic limit: for any such system the spectral gap of a size-$n$ chain
with open boundary conditions is upper bounded as $O(n^{-2})$. This contrasts
with gapless frustrated systems where the gap can be $\Theta(n^{-1})$. It also
limits the extent to which the area law is violated in these frustration-free
systems, since it implies that the half-chain entanglement entropy is
$O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ as a function of spectral gap $\epsilon$. We extend our
results to frustration-free systems on a 2D square lattice.

embedded systems, young massive clusters, and associations. We study the
formation and dynamical evolution of these clusters using a combination of
simulations and theoretical models. Our simulations start with a turbulent
molecular cloud that collapses under its own gravity. The stars are assumed to
form in the densest regions in the collapsing cloud after an initial free-fall
times of the molecular cloud. The dynamical evolution of these stellar
distributions are continued by means of direct $N$-body simulations. The
molecular clouds typical for the Milky Way Galaxy tend to form embedded
clusters which evolve to resemble open clusters. The associations were
initially considerably more clumpy, but lost their irregularity in about a
dynamical time scale due to the relaxation process. The densest molecular
clouds, which are absent in the Milky Way but are typical in starburst
galaxies, form massive young star clusters. They indeed are rare in the Milky
Way. Our models indicate a distinct evolutionary path from molecular clouds to
open clusters and associations or to massive star clusters. The mass-radius
relation for both types of evolutionary tracks excellently matches the
observations. According to our calculations the time evolution of the half-mass
radius for open clusters and associations follows $r_{\rm h}/{\rm
pc}=2.7(t_{\rm age}/{\rm pc})^{2/3}$, whereas for massive star clusters $r_{\rm
h}/{\rm pc}=0.34(t_{\rm age}/{\rm Myr})^{2/3}$. Both trends are consistent with
the observed age-mass-radius relation for clusters in the Milky Way.

distortion. In particular, the two shear modes in bilayer ReS2 are
non-degenerate and well separated in the Raman spectrum, in contrast to the

special class of sum rules that are direct consequences of the independent
chiral symmetry that exists at every point on the two-dimensional transverse
plane orthogonal to the lightlike direction. These sum rules are obtained by
exploiting the closed, infinite-dimensional algebra satisfied by the transverse
moments of null-plane axial-vector and vector charge distributions. In the
special case of a nucleon target, this procedure leads to the Adler-Weisberger,
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn, Cabbibo-Radicatti and Fubini-Furlan-Rossetti sum rules.
Matching to the dispersion-theoretic language which is usually invoked in

action of two distinct levels. At the first step of the game, using a random
prescription half players are assigned the cooperation and half the defection
state. At the bottom level the strategy choice is done on the mere basis of
imitation according to the homo imitans principle, generating a form of
collective intelligence that makes the system sensitive to the criteria
determining the strategy choice adopted at the top level. The units of the top
level, in fact, play the prisoner's dilemma game and are allowed to update
their strategy either by selecting the strategy of the most successful nearest
neighbor, success model, or merely on the basis of the criterion of the best
financial benefit, selfishness model. The intelligence emerging from
imitation-induced criticality leads in the former case to the extinction of
defection and in the latter case to the extinction of cooperation. The former
case is interpreted as a form of network reciprocity enhanced by the
imitation-induced criticality and contributing to the evolution towards
cooperation. We perturb the selfishness model with a form of morality pressure,
exerted by a psychological reward Lambda for cooperation, to establish the
sensitivity of collective intelligence to morality. We find that when Lambda
gets a crucial value Lambda-c, exceeding the temptation to cheat, the system

optimization process and improve the scalability for large graphs, Strandmark
and Kahl introduced a splitting method to split a graph into multiple subgraphs
for parallel computation in both shared and distributed memory models. However,
this parallel algorithm (parallel BK-algorithm) does not have a polynomial
bound on the number of iterations and is found non-convergent in some cases due
to the possible multiple optimal solutions of its sub-problems.
  To remedy this non-convergence problem, in this work we first introduce a
merging method capable of merging any number of those adjacent sub-graphs which
could hardly reach an agreement on their overlapped region in the parallel BK
algorithm. Based on the pseudo-boolean representations of graph cuts,our
merging method is shown able to effectively reuse all the computed flows in
these sub-graphs. Through both the splitting and merging, we further propose a
dynamic parallel and distributed graph-cuts algorithm with guaranteed
convergence to the globally optimal solutions within a predefined number of
iterations. In essence, this work provides a general framework to allow more
sophisticated splitting and merging strategies to be employed to further boost
performance. Our dynamic parallel algorithm is validated with extensive
experimental results.

features are typically cast as impossibility statements: two noncommuting
observables cannot in general both be sharply defined (for the same state), nor
can they be measured jointly. The pioneers of quantum mechanics were acutely
aware and puzzled by this fact, and it motivated Heisenberg to seek a
mitigation, which he formulated in his seminal paper of 1927. He provided
intuitive arguments to show that the values of, say, the position and momentum
of a particle can at least be unsharply defined, and they can be measured
together provided some approximation errors are allowed. Only now, nine decades
later, a working theory of approximate joint measurements is taking shape,
leading to rigorous and experimentally testable formulations of associated
error tradeoff relations. Here we briefly review this new development,
explaining the concepts and steps taken in the construction of optimal joint
approximations of pairs of incompatible observables. As a case study, we deduce
measurement uncertainty relations for qubit observables using two distinct
error measures. We provide an operational interpretation of the error bounds
and discuss some of the first experimental tests of such relations.

on the setting in which A is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries, we show that
if the sensing matrix A admits an oversampling ratio of 2 or higher, then with

order of the observations in y. Furthermore, if x is of dimension K, then any
2K entries of y are sufficient to recover x. This result implies the existence
of deterministic unlabeled sensing matrices with an oversampling factor of 2

guaranteed for all possible choices of x. While the proof is constructive, it
uses a combinatorial algorithm which is not practical, leaving the question of

local stability is guaranteed by the solution. In particular, for every x, the
recovery error tends to zero as the signal-to-noise-ratio tends to infinity.
The question of universal stability is unclear. We also obtain a converse of

this star looks like a normal solar abundance main sequence F1V to F3V dwarf

significant ongoing accretion onto the star nor any stellar outflow away from
it. Our results are inconsistent with large amounts of static close-in
obscuring material or the unusual behavior of a YSO system, but are consistent
with the favored episodic models of a Gyr old stellar system favored by
Boyajian et al. (2015). We speculate that KIC8462852, like the approximately
1.4 Gyr old F2V system {\eta} Corvi (Wyatt et al. 2005, Chen et al. 2006, Lisse

and hydroxyapatite. Associated complex interfaces and processes remain
difficult to analyze at the 1 to 100 nm scale using current laboratory
techniques, and prior models for atomistic simulations are limited in the
representation of chemical bonding, surface chemistry, and interfacial
interactions. This work introduces an accurate force field along with
pH-resolved surface models for hydroxyapatite to represent chemical bonding,
structural, surface, interfacial, and mechanical properties in quantitative
agreement with experiment. The accuracy is orders of magnitude higher in
comparison to earlier models to facilitate quantitative monitoring of
inorganic-biological assembly. The force field is integrated into the CHARMM,
AMBER, OPLS-AA, PCFF, and INTERFACE force fields to enable realistic
simulations of apatite-biological systems of any composition and ionic
strength. Specifically, the parameters reproduce lattice constants (<0.5%
deviation), IR spectrum, cleavage energies, immersion energies in water (<5%
deviation), and elastic constants (<10% deviation) of hydroxyapatite in
comparison to experiment. Interactions between mineral, water, and organic
compounds are represented by standard combination rules in the force field
without additional adjustable parameters and shown to achieve quantitative
accuracy. Surface models for common (001), (010), (020), (101) facets and
nanocrystals are introduced as a function of pH on the basis of extensive
experimental data. New insight into surface and immersion energies, the
structure of aqueous interfaces, density profiles, and superficial dissolution
is described. Mechanisms of specific binding of peptides, drugs, and
mineralization can be analyzed and the force field is extensible to substituted
and defective apatites as well as to other calcium phosphate phases.

magnetically driven outflows to explain hysteretic state transition observed in
X-ray binaries (XRBs). The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when
the mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion
rate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to
accretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The
radial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of
the external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the
low/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the
thin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so
a strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may
accelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may
carry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases
the radial velocity of the ADAF significantly. This leads to a high critical
mass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive.
Our calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic
outflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional
ADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure $\beta\sim 4$ in the disk. This
can naturally explain the hysteretic state transition observed in XRBs.

appears near a putative magnetic quantum critical point, suggesting that

also promote unconventional pairing. Here we investigate theoretically the
impact of disorder on such a quantum critical pairing state, considering the
coupling of impurities both to the low-energy electronic states and to the

  We suspected an aggregation bias. After adjusting for changes in age

for this age group. Instead there is an increasing trend from 1999-2005 and a
constant trend thereafter. Moreover, stratifying age-adjusted mortality rates
by sex shows a marked increase only for women and not men, contrary to the

  We stress that this does not change a key finding of the Case and Deaton
paper: the comparison of non-Hispanic U.S. middle-aged whites to other
countries and other ethnic groups. These comparisons hold up after our age
adjustment. While we do not believe that age-adjustment invalidates comparisons
between countries, it does affect claims concerning the absolute increase in
mortality among U.S. middle-aged white non-Hispanics. Breaking down the trends
in this group by region of the country shows other interesting patterns: since
1999 there has been an increase in death rates among women in the south. In
contrast, death rates for both sexes have been declining in the northeast, the
region where mortality rates were lowest to begin with. These graphs
demonstrate the value of this sort of data exploration, and we are grateful to

evaluated at high densities and high temperatures relevant to the final
evolution of electron-degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of stars with the initial masses
of 8-10 solar mass. Electron capture induces a rapid contraction of the
electron-degenerate O-Ne-Mg core. The outcome of rapid contraction depends on
the evolutionary changes in the central density and temperature, which are
determined by the competing processes of contraction, cooling, and heating. The
fate of the stars are determined by these competitions, whether they end up
with electron-capture supernovae or Fe core-collapse supernovae. Since the
competing processes are induced by electron capture and beta-decay, the
accurate weak rates are crucially important. The rates are obtained for pairs
with A=20, 23, 24, 25 and 27 by shell-model calculations in sd-shell with the
USDB Hamiltonian. Effects of Coulomb corrections on the rates are evaluated.
The rates for pairs with A=23 and 25 are important for nuclear URCA processes
that determine the cooling rate of O-Ne-Mg core, while those for pairs with
A=20 and 24 are important for the core-contraction and heat generation rates in
the core. We provide these nuclear rates at stellar environments in tables with
fine enough meshes at various densities and temperatures for the studies of
astrophysical processes sensitive to the rates. In particular, the accurate
rate tables are crucially important for the final fates of not only O-Ne-Mg

is $q=(3.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-4}$ and the projected separation normalized by the
Einstein radius is $s=2.39\pm0.05$. There are three degenerate physical

$14_{-1}^{+11}$ times larger than $a_{\rm snow}$ for these models,
respectively. The Keck AO observation confirm that the lens is faint. This
discovery suggests that low-mass planets with Neptune-like orbit are common. So
processes similar to the one that formed Neptune in our own Solar System or

selection for a novel video streaming scheme called streamloading.
Streamloading is a recently developed method for delivering high quality video
without violating copyright enforced restrictions on content access for video
streaming. In regular streaming services, content providers restrict the amount
of viewable video that users can download prior to playback. This approach can
cause inferior user experience due to bandwidth variations, especially in
mobile networks with varying capacity. In streamloading, the video is encoded
using Scalable Video Coding, and users are allowed to pre-fetch enhancement
layers and store them on the device, while base layers are streamed in a near
real-time fashion ensuring that buffering constraints on viewable content are
met.
  We begin by formulating the offline problem of jointly optimizing rate
allocation and quality selection for streamloading in a wireless network. This
motivates our proposed online algorithms for joint scheduling at the base
station and segment quality selection at receivers. The results indicate that
streamloading outperforms state-of-the-art streaming schemes in terms of the
number of additional streams we can admit for a given video quality.
Furthermore, the quality adaptation mechanism of our proposed algorithm
achieves a higher performance than baseline algorithms with no (or limited)
video-centric optimization of the base station's allocation of resources, e.g.,
proportional fairness.

Model-like Higgs boson interactions arising from tree-level mixing with heavy

organize interactions within the effective theory. Vacuum states arising from
electroweak singlet extensions of the Higgs sector yield at leading order only
two effective dimension-six operators. One of these uniformly dilutes all the

three types of effective dimension-six operators that modify physical Higgs
boson couplings to fermion pairs, self-couplings, and introduce four-fermion
interactions. However, in this case modification of physical Higgs boson
interactions with massive gauge bosons arise at leading order only from three
effective dimension-eight operators. If the underlying Yukawa couplings of the
additional electroweak doublet satisfy the Glashow-Weinberg condition then time
reversal violation at effective dimension-six depends on a single universal
phase appearing only in couplings of physical Higgs bosons to fermion pairs. In
all cases the couplings of any three physical states in the effective theory

the long distance non-analytic components of physical on-shell scattering

consistent with a range of H$_{2}$O mixing ratios and cloud-top pressures, with
a minimum H$_{2}$O mixing ratio of 17~$^{+12}_{-6}$~ppm corresponding to the

the neutral-hydrogen $21$-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR:

derive scintillation noise power-spectra in such experiments while taking into
account the effects of typical data processing operations such as
self-calibration and Fourier synthesis. We find that for minimally redundant
arrays such as LOFAR and MWA, scintillation noise is of the same order of
magnitude as thermal noise, has a spectral coherence dictated by stretching of
the snapshot $uv$-coverage with frequency, and thus is confined to the well
known wedge-like structure in the cylindrical ($2$-dimensional) power spectrum
space. Compact, fully redundant ($d_{\rm core}\lesssim r_{\rm F} \approx 300$ m
at $150$ MHz) arrays such as HERA and SKA-LOW (core) will be scintillation
noise dominated at all baselines, but the spatial and frequency coherence of

the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations. We investigate the dynamics
of the condensate fraction as well as the momentum distribution of the Bose gas
following a sudden change of system parameters. Typically, the system evolves
into a steady state in the long-time limit, which features an oscillating
momentum distribution and a stationary condensate fraction which is dependent
on the quench parameters. We investigate how different quench parameters such
as the inter- and intra-species interactions and the spin-orbit-coupling

find that the time average of the oscillatory momentum distribution in the

Chern-Simons theories at level k coupled to fermions, and U(k) Chern-Simons

large N 't Hooft limit, where many details of the duality (such as whether the
gauge group is U(N) or SU(N), the precise level of the U(1) factor, and order
one shifts in the level) are not important. The main evidence for the validity
of the duality at finite N comes from adding masses and flowing to pure
Chern-Simons theories related by level-rank duality, and from flowing to the
non-supersymmetric duality from supersymmetric dualities, whose finite N
validity is well-established. In this note we clarify the implications of these
flows for the precise form of the duality; in particular we argue that in its
simplest form the duality maps SU(N) theories to U(k) theories, though there is
also another version relating U(N) to U(k). This precise form strongly affects
the mapping under the duality of baryon and monopole operators, and we show,
following arguments by Radicevic, that their mapping is consistent with our
claims. We also discuss the implications of our results for the additional
duality between these Chern-Simons matter theories and (the UV completion of)
high-spin gravity theories on AdS_4. The latter theories should contain heavy
particles carrying electric and/or magnetic charges under their U(1) gauge

example, to design a machine translation system, a typical training set will
consist of English sentences and their translation. There is a stronger model,
in which the algorithm can also query for labels of new examples it creates.
E.g, in the translation task, the algorithm can create a new English sentence,
and request its translation from the user during training. This combination of
examples and queries has been widely studied. Yet, despite many theoretical
results, query algorithms are almost never used. One of the main causes for
this is a report (Baum and Lang, 1992) on very disappointing empirical
performance of a query algorithm. These poor results were mainly attributed to
the fact that the algorithm queried for labels of examples that are artificial,
and impossible to interpret by humans.
  In this work we study a new model of local membership queries (Awasthi et
al., 2012), which tries to resolve the problem of artificial queries. In this
model, the algorithm is only allowed to query the labels of examples which are
close to examples from the training set. E.g., in translation, the algorithm
can change individual words in a sentence it has already seen, and then ask for
the translation. In this model, the examples queried by the algorithm will be
close to natural examples and hence, hopefully, will not appear as artificial
or random. We focus on 1-local queries (i.e., queries of distance 1 from an
example in the training sample). We show that 1-local membership queries are
already stronger than the standard learning model. We also present an
experiment on a well known NLP task of sentiment analysis. In this experiment,
the users were asked to provide more information than merely indicating the
label. We present results that illustrate that this extra information is
beneficial in practice.

low-redshift ones from their large 500{\mu}m to 24{\mu}m flux density ratios.
By effectively reducing the contribution from low-redshift populations to the
observed 500{\mu}m emission, we are able to identify counterparts to high-z
500{\mu}m sources whose 24{\mu}m fluxes are relatively faint. The recovery of
known z~4 starbursts confirms the efficiency of this approach in selecting
high-z Herschel sources. The resulting sample consists of 34 dusty star-forming
galaxies at z~>2. The inferred infrared luminosities are in the range
1.5x10^12-1.8x10^13 Lsun, corresponding to dust-obscured star formation rates
(SFRs) of ~260-3100 Msun/yr for a Salpeter IMF. Comparison with previous SCUBA
850{\mu}m-selected galaxy samples shows that our method is more efficient at
selecting high-z dusty galaxies with a median redshift of z=3.07+/-0.83 and 10
of the sources at z~>4. We find that at a fixed luminosity, the dust
temperature is ~5K cooler than that expected from the Td-LIR relation at z<1,
though different temperature selection effects should be taken into account.
The radio-detected subsample (excluding three strong AGN) follows the
far-infrared/radio correlation at lower redshifts, and no evolution with
redshift is observed out to z~5, suggesting that the far-infrared emission is
star formation dominated. The contribution of the high-z Herschel 500{\mu}m
sources to the cosmic SFR density is comparable to that of SMG populations at
z~2.5 and at least 40% of the extinction-corrected UV samples at z~4

inflationary predictions. The main such tool is Open EFTs which reduce in the
inflationary case to Stochastic Inflation plus calculable corrections. We apply
this to a simple inflationary model that is complicated enough to have
dangerous IR behaviour yet simple enough to allow the inference of late-time
behaviour. We find corrections to standard Stochastic Inflationary predictions
for the noise and drift, and we find these corrections ensure the IR finiteness
of both these quantities. The late-time probability distribution, ${\cal
P}(\phi)$, for super-Hubble field fluctuations are obtained as functions of the
noise and drift and so these too are IR finite. We compare our results to other
methods (such as large-$N$ models) and find they agree when these models are
reliable. In all cases we can explore in detail we find IR secular effects
describe the slow accumulation of small perturbations to give a big effect: a
significant distortion of the late-time probability distribution for the field.
But the energy density associated with this is only of order $H^4$ at late
times and so does {\em not} generate a dramatic gravitational back-reaction.

This latest addition to the still-small family of CBPs defies the current trend
of known short-period planets orbiting near the stability limit of binary
stars. Unlike the previous discoveries, the planet revolving around the
eclipsing binary system Kepler-1647 has a very long orbital period (~1100 days)
and was at conjunction only twice during the Kepler mission lifetime. Due to
the singular configuration of the system, Kepler-1647b is not only the
longest-period transiting CBP at the time of writing, but also one of the
longest-period transiting planets. With a radius of 1.06+/-0.01 RJup it is also
the largest CBP to date. The planet produced three transits in the light-curve
of Kepler-1647 (one of them during an eclipse, creating a syzygy) and
measurably perturbed the times of the stellar eclipses, allowing us to measure
its mass to be 1.52+/-0.65 MJup. The planet revolves around an 11-day period
eclipsing binary consisting of two Solar-mass stars on a slightly inclined,
mildly eccentric (e_bin = 0.16), spin-synchronized orbit. Despite having an
orbital period three times longer than Earth's, Kepler-1647b is in the
conservative habitable zone of the binary star throughout its orbit.

left-right model with gauge symmetry $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R
\times U(1)_{X}$ where the SM leptons are singlets under $SU(2)_R$. The gauge
anomalies are cancelled by introducing extra vector-like quarks. The mass of
$Z^\prime$ gauge boson, which cannot be leptophobic, is assumed to be around or
above 2.5 TeV so that the constraint on dilepton final state can be avoided.
Moreover, we find that the $W^\prime \to WZ$ channel cannot explain the ATLAS
diboson excess due to the tension with the constraint on $W^\prime \to jj$
decay mode. We solve this problem by considering the mixings between the SM
quarks and vector-like quarks. We show explicitly that the ATLAS diboson excess
can be explained in the viable parameter space of our model, which is
consistent with all the current experimental constraints.

threshold and commonly associated to the pygmy dipole resonance offers a unique
information on neutron skin and symmetry energy, and is of astrophysical
interest. The nature of such a resonance is still under debate.
  Purpose: We intend to describe the giant and pygmy resonances in 208 Pb by
enhancing their fragmentation with respect to the random-phase approximation.
  Method: We adopt the equation of motion phonon method to perform a fully
self-consistent calculation in a space spanned by one-phonon and two-phonon
basis states using an optimized chiral two-body potential. A phenomenological
density dependent term, derived from a contact three-body force, is added in
order to get single-particle spectra more realistic than the ones obtained by
using the chiral potential only. The calculation takes into full account the
Pauli principle and is free of spurious center of mass admixtures.
  Results: We obtain a fair description of the giant resonance and obtain a
dense low-lying spectrum in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.
The transition densities as well as the phonon and particle-hole composi- tion
of the most strongly excited states support the pygmy nature of the low-lying
resonance. Finally, we obtain realistic values for the dipole polarizability
and the neutron skin radius.
  Conclusions: The results emphasize the role of the two-phonon states in
enhancing the fragmentation of the strength in the giant resonance region and
at low energy, consistently with experiments. For a more detailed agreement
with the data, the calculation suggests the inclusion of the three-phonon
states as well as a fine tuning of the single-particle spectrum to be obtained
by a refinement of the nuclear potential.

radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RLNLS1s). This is the largest known
sample of this type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) to date. We found that 17%
of sources were detected at high-energy gamma rays (E>100 MeV), and 90% at
X-rays (0.3-10 keV). The masses of the central black holes are in the range
$\sim 10^{6-8}M_{\odot}$, smaller than the values of blazars. The disk
luminosities are about 1-49% of the Eddington value, with one outlier at 0.3%,
comparable with the luminosities observed in flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs). The jet powers are $\sim 10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable with BL
Lac Objects, yet relatively smaller than FSRQs. However, once renormalized by
the mass of the central black hole, the jet powers of RLNLS1s, BL Lacs, and
FSRQs are consistent each other, indicating the scalability of the jets. We
found episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours.
In some cases, dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as the
interplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk. We conclude
that, despite the distinct observational properties, the central engines of
RLNLS1s are similar to those of blazars.

energy production at large pseudorapidity is observed to decrease with a linear
dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction in the target proton and to
depend only weakly on that in the projectile proton. The results are compared

permalloy (Py) nanotube (NT) using a hybrid magnetometer consisting of a
nanometer-scale SQUID (nanoSQUID) and a cantilever torque sensor. The Py NT is
affixed to the tip of a Si cantilever and positioned in order to optimally
couple its stray flux into a Nb nanoSQUID. We are thus able to measure both the
NT's volume magnetization by dynamic cantilever magnetometry and its stray flux
using the nanoSQUID. We observe a training effect and temperature dependence in
the magnetic hysteresis, suggesting an exchange bias. We find a low blocking
temperature $T_B = 18 \pm 2$ K, indicating the presence of a thin
antiferromagnetic native oxide, as confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy
on similar samples. Furthermore, we measure changes in the shape of the
magnetic hysteresis as a function of temperature and increased training. These
observations show that the presence of a thin exchange-coupled native oxide
modifies the magnetization reversal process at low temperatures. Complementary
information obtained via cantilever and nanoSQUID magnetometry allows us to
conclude that, in the absence of exchange coupling, this reversal process is
nucleated at the NT's ends and propagates along its length as predicted by
theory.

addition to two previously described variants based on neutral fragments, we
present a third version taking a different route to the approximate diabatic
state by explicitly considering charged fragments. In applying these FO-DFT
flavors to the two molecular test sets HAB7 (electron transfer) and HAB11 (hole
transfer) we find that our new scheme gives improved electronic couplings for
HAB7 (-6.2% decrease in mean relative signed error) and greatly improved
electronic couplings for HAB11 (-15.3% decrease in mean relative signed error).
A systematic investigation of the influence of exact exchange on the electronic
coupling values shows that the use of hybrid functionals in FO-DFT calculations
improves the electronic couplings, giving values close to or even better than
more sophisticated constrained DFT calculations. Comparing the accuracy and
computational cost of each variant we devise simple rules to choose the best
possible flavor depending on the task. For accuracy, our new scheme with
charged-fragment calculations performs best, while numerically more efficient
at reasonable accuracy is the variant with neutral fragments.

characterized by line nodes (two bands touching along a line). Inspired by our
previous discoveries that the kicked Harper model exhibits many fascinating
features of Floquet topological phases, in this manuscript we consider a
generalization of the model, where two additional periodic system parameters
are introduced into the Hamiltonian to serve as artificial dimensions, so as to
simulate a 3D system. We observe that by increasing the hopping strength and
the kicking strength of the system, many new band touching points at Floquet
quasienergies $0$ and $\pi$ will start to appear. Some of them are Weyl points,
while the others form line nodes in the parameter space. By taking open
boundary conditions along the physical dimension, edge states analogues to
Fermi arcs in static Weyl semimetal systems are observed. Finally, by designing
an adiabatic pumping scheme, the chirality of the Weyl points and the $\pi$
Berry phase around line nodes can be manifested.

2013 December and 2014 April. In this work, we present a detailed
multi-wavelength analysis of the 2013 December flaring event. Multi-frequency
observations reveal the uncorrelated variability patterns with X-ray and
optical-UV fluxes peaking after the $\gamma$-ray maximum. The broadband
spectral energy distribution (SED) at the peak of the $\gamma$-ray activity
shows a rising $\gamma$-ray spectrum but a declining optical-UV flux. This
observation along with the detection of uncorrelated variability behavior rules
out the one-zone leptonic emission scenario. We, therefore, adopt two
independent methodologies to explain the SED: a time dependent lepto-hadronic
modeling and a two-zone leptonic radiative modeling approach. In the
lepto-hadronic modeling, a distribution of electrons and protons subjected to a
randomly orientated magnetic field produces synchrotron radiation. Electron
synchrotron is used to explain the IR to UV emission while proton synchrotron
emission is used to explain the high energy $\gamma$-ray emission. A
combination of both electron synchrotron self Compton emission and proton
synchrotron emission is used to explain the X-ray spectral break seen during
the later stage of the flare. In the two-zone modeling, we assume a large
emission region emitting primarily in IR to X-rays and $\gamma$-rays to come
primarily from a fast moving compact emission region. We conclude by noting
that within a span of 4 months, 3C 279 has shown the dominance of a variety of
radiative processes over each other and this reflects the complexity involved
in understanding the physical properties of blazar jets in general.

simulating many complete artificial datasets from the model. We advocate in
this paper a ""divide and conquer"" approach to ABC, where we split the
likelihood into n factors, and combine in some way n ""local"" ABC approximations
of each factor. This has two advantages: (a) such an approach is typically much
faster than standard ABC and (b) it makes it possible to use local summary
statistics (i.e. summary statistics that depend only on the data-points that
correspond to a single factor), rather than global summary statistics (that
depend on the complete dataset). This greatly alleviates the bias introduced by
summary statistics, and even removes it entirely in situations where local
summary statistics are simply the identity function.
  We focus on EP (Expectation-Propagation), a convenient and powerful way to
combine n local approximations into a global approximation. Compared to the EP-
ABC approach of Barthelm\'e and Chopin (2014), we present two variations, one
based on the parallel EP algorithm of Cseke and Heskes (2011), which has the
advantage of being implementable on a parallel architecture, and one version
which bridges the gap between standard EP and parallel EP. We illustrate our
approach with an expensive application of ABC, namely inference on spatial

field theory, by rederiving it starting from the action of Fermi gas in the
rotating frame of reference. The rotation leads to the appearance of an
effective vector potential, and the coupling strength of this vector potential
to the macroscopic wave function depends on the interaction strength between
the fermions, due to a renormalization of the pair effective mass in the
effective field theory. The mass renormalization derived here is in agreement
with results of functional renormalization group theory. In the extreme BEC
regime, the pair effective mass tends to twice the fermion mass, in agreement
with the physical picture of a weakly interacting Bose gas of molecular pairs.
Then, we use our macroscopic wave function description to study vortices and
the critical rotation frequencies to form them. Equilibrium vortex state
diagrams are derived, and they are in good agreement with available results of

is even more problematic when one aims at controlling the Markov jump processes

control problems of the Markov jump processes in the case that the controls can
only be switched at fixed control stages. Based on Kurtz's limit theorems, we
prove the convergence of the respective control value functions of the

we propose a hybrid control policy algorithm to overcome the difficulties due

of the important use cases of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). In
Virtualized Radio Access Networks (VRANs), some functions from a Base Station
(BS), such as those which make up the Base Band Unit (BBU), may be implemented
in a shared infrastructure located at either a data center or distributed in
network nodes. For the latter option, one challenge is in deciding which subset
of the available network nodes can be used to host the physical BBU servers
(the placement problem), and then to which of the available physical BBUs each
Remote Radio Head (RRH) should be assigned (the assignment problem). These two
problems constitute what we refer to as the VRAN Placement and Assignment
Problem (VRAN-PAP). In this paper, we start by formally defining the VRAN-PAP
before formulating it as a Binary Integer Linear Program (BILP) whose objective
is to minimize the server and front haul link setup costs as well as the
latency between each RRH and its assigned BBU. Since the BILP could become
computationally intractable, we also propose a greedy approximation for larger
instances of the VRAN-PAP. We perform simulations to compare both algorithms in
terms of solution quality as well as computation time under varying network
sizes and setup budgets.

from full loop quantum gravity, we investigate the relation between a
quantisation of spherically symmetric general relativity and a reduction at the
quantum level. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed quantum
reduction by dropping the gauge fixing condition on the radial diffeomorphisms,
thus allowing to make direct contact between previous work on reduced
quantisation. A dictionary between spherically symmetric variables and
observables with respect to the reduction constraints in the full theory is
discussed, as well as an embedding of reduced quantum states to a sub sector of
the quantum symmetry reduced full theory states. On this full theory sub
sector, the quantum algebra of the mentioned observables is computed and shown
to qualitatively reproduce the quantum algebra of the reduced variables in the
large quantum number limit for a specific choice of regularisation.
Insufficiencies in recovering the reduced algebra quantitatively from the full
theory are attributed to the oversimplified full theory quantum states we use.

time-dilatation formula states that the decay width for an unstable state
moving with a momentum $p$ and mass $M$ is $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}=\Gamma
M/\sqrt{p^{2}+M^{2}}$ with $\Gamma$ being the decay width in the rest frame. In
agreement with previous studies, we show that in the context of QM as well as
QFT this equation is \textit{not} correct provided that the quantum measurement
is performed in a reference frame in which the unstable particle has momentum
$p$ (note, a momentum eigenstate is \textit{not} a velocity eigenstate in QM).
We then give, to our knowledge for the first time, an analytic expression of an
improved formula and we show that the deviation from $\tilde{\Gamma}_{p}$ has a
maximum for $p/M=\sqrt{2/3},$ but is typically \textit{very} small. Then, the
result can be easily generalized to a momentum wave packet and also to an
arbitrary initial state. Here, we give a very general expression of the
non-decay probability. As a next step, we show that care is needed when one
makes a boost of an unstable state with zero momentum/velocity: namely, the
resulting state has zero overlap with the elements of the basis of unstable
states (it is already decayed!). However, when considering a spread in
velocity, one finds again that $\tilde{\Gamma }_{p}$ is typically a very good
approximation. The study of a velocity wave-packet represents an interesting
subject which constitutes one of the main outcomes of the present
manuscript.\textbf{ }In the end, it should be stressed that there is no
whatsoever breaking of special relativity, but as usual in QM, one should
specify which kind of measurement on which kind of state is performed.

color deviating from its true value, so fast and high quality highlight removal
from a single nature image is of great importance. In spite of the progress in
the past decades in highlight removal, achieving wide applicability to the
large diversity of nature scenes is quite challenging. To handle this problem,
we propose an analytic solution to highlight removal based on an L2
chromaticity definition and corresponding dichromatic model. Specifically, this
paper derives a normalized dichromatic model for the pixels with identical
diffuse color: a unit circle equation of projection coefficients in two
subspaces that are orthogonal to and parallel with the illumination,
respectively. In the former illumination orthogonal subspace, which is
specular-free, we can conduct robust clustering with an explicit criterion to
determine the cluster number adaptively. In the latter illumination parallel
subspace, a property called pure diffuse pixels distribution rule (PDDR) helps
map each specular-influenced pixel to its diffuse component. In terms of
efficiency, the proposed approach involves few complex calculation, and thus
can remove highlight from high resolution images fast. Experiments show that
this method is of superior performance in various challenging cases.

randomly picking activation based on a multinomial distribution at training

probabilistic weighted pooling, instead of commonly used max-pooling, to act as
model averaging at test time. Empirical evidence validates the superiority of
probabilistic weighted pooling. We also empirically show that the effect of
convolutional dropout is not trivial, despite the dramatically reduced
possibility of over-fitting due to the convolutional architecture. Elaborately
designing dropout training simultaneously in max-pooling and fully-connected
layers, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, and very competitive
results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, relative to other approaches without data
augmentation. Finally, we compare max-pooling dropout and stochastic pooling,
both of which introduce stochasticity based on multinomial distributions at
pooling stage.

1.4. The public HST images and multi-band photometry over the HDFS are used to
constrain the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxies and to
perform a morphological analysis. We derive the resolved ionized gas properties
of these galaxies from the MUSE data and model the disk (both in 2D and with
GalPaK$^{\rm 3D}$) to retrieve their intrinsic gas kinematics. We build a
sample of resolved emission-line galaxies of much lower stellar mass and SFR
(by $\sim$1-2 orders of magnitude) than previous 3D spectroscopic surveys. Most
of the spatially-resolved MUSE-HDFS galaxies have gas kinematics consistent
with disk-like rotation, but about 20% have velocity dispersions larger than
the rotation velocities, and 30% are part of a close pair and/or show clear
signs of recent gravitational interactions. In the high-mass regime, the
MUSE-HDFS galaxies follow the Tully-Fisher relation defined from previous
surveys in a similar redshift range. This scaling relation extends also to
lower masses/velocities but with a higher dispersion. The MUSE-HDFS galaxies
follow the scaling relations defined in the local universe between the specific
angular momentum and the stellar mass. However, we find that
intermediate-redshift star-forming galaxies fill a continuum transition from
the spiral to elliptical local scaling relations, according to the dynamical
state of the gas. This indicates that some galaxies may lose their angular
momentum and become dispersion-dominated prior to becoming passive.

versatile components for future quantum technologies. Quantum memories with
high storage capacities are one such example which require long-lived states
that can be addressed and manipulated coherently within the inhomogeneously
broadened ensemble. This broadening is essential for true multimode memories,
but induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a
cavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time. In this work
we show how to overcome both of these limitations through the engineering of
long-lived dark states in an ensemble of electron spins hosted by
nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. By burning narrow spectral holes into a
spin ensemble strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity, we
observe long-lived Rabi oscillations with high visibility and a decay rate that
is a factor of forty smaller than the spin ensemble linewidth and thereby a
factor of more than three below the pure cavity dissipation rate. This
significant reduction lives up to the promise of hybrid devices to perform
better than their individual subcomponents. To demonstrate the potential of our
approach we realise the first step towards a solid-state microwave spin
multiplexer by engineering multiple long-lived dark states. Our results show
that we can fully access the ""decoherence free"" subspace in our experiment and
selectively prepare protected states by spectral hole burning. This technique
opens up the way for truly long-lived quantum memories, solid-state microwave
frequency combs, optical to microwave quantum transducers and spin squeezed
states. Our approach also paves the way for a new class of cavity QED
experiments with dense spin ensembles, where dipole spin-spin interactions
become important and many-body phenomena will be directly accessible on a chip.

refers to processes which are conducted by the body (and environment) that

reason is that it allows to significantly reduce the controller complexity. An
important aspect of morphological computation is that it cannot be assigned to
an embodied system per se, but that it is, as we show, behavior- and
state-dependent. In this work, we evaluate two different measures of
morphological computation that can be applied in robotic systems and in
computer simulations of biological movement. As an example, these measures were
evaluated on muscle and DC-motor driven hopping models. We show that a

that cannot be gained from the averaged measures alone. This work includes

distance in the Virgo Cluster. We find a gradient in [$\alpha$/Fe], where the
galaxies closest to the cluster center (the cD galaxy, M87) have the highest
values. This trend is driven by galaxies within a projected radius of 0.4~Mpc
(0.26 times the virial radius of Virgo~A), all of which have super-solar
[$\alpha$/Fe]. Galaxies in this mass range exhibit a large scatter in the
[$\alpha$/Fe]--$\sigma$ diagram, and do not obviously lie on an extension of
the relation defined by massive ETGs. In addition, we find a correlation
between [$\alpha$/Fe] and globular cluster specific frequency ($S_N$),
suggesting that low-mass ETGs that formed their stars over a short period of
time, were also efficient at forming massive star clusters. The innermost
low-mass ETGs in our sample have [$\alpha$/Fe] values comparable to that of
M87, implying that environment is the controlling factor for star formation
timescales in dense regions. These low-mass galaxies could be the surviving
counterparts of the objects that have already been accreted into the halo of

as it allows the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces (e.g. LTE and WiFi).
When multiple sources and multiple clients are considered, the optimal set of
distribution trees should be determined in order to optimally use all the
available interfaces. This is not a trivial task, as it is a computationally
intense procedure that should be done centrally. The need for central
coordination can be removed by employing network coding, which also offers
improved resiliency to errors and large throughput gains. In this paper, we
propose NetCodCCN, a protocol for integrating network coding in CCN. In
comparison to previous works proposing to enable network coding in CCN,
NetCodCCN permit Interest aggregation and Interest pipelining, which reduce the
data retrieval times. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed
protocol leads to significant improvements in terms of content retrieval delay
compared to the original CCN. Our results demonstrate that the use of network
coding adds robustness to losses and permits to exploit more efficiently the
available network resources. The performance gains are verified for content
retrieval in various network scenarios.

constants. Reaching higher precision requires longer interferometer times which
are naturally encountered in microgravity environments such as drop-tower

fundamental quantum physics in space. In all those cases, it is necessary to
consider arbitrary trajectories and varying orientations of the interferometer
set-up in non-inertial frames of reference.
  Here we provide a versatile representation-free description of atom
interferometry entirely based on operator algebra to address this general
situation. We show how to analytically determine the phase shift as well as the
visibility of interferometers with an arbitrary number of pulses including the
effects of local gravitational accelerations, gravity gradients, the rotation
of the lasers and non-inertial frames of reference. Our method conveniently
unifies previous results and facilitates the investigation of novel

mode can be decomposed into a sum of elementary modes. However, only a
decomposition without cancelations is biochemically meaningful, since a
reversible reaction cannot have different directions in the contributing
elementary modes. This essential requirement has been largely overlooked by the
metabolic pathway community.
  Indeed, every flux mode can be decomposed into elementary modes without
cancelations. The result is an immediate consequence of a theorem by
Rockafellar which states that every element of a linear subspace is a conformal
sum (a sum without cancelations) of elementary vectors (support-minimal
vectors). In this work, we extend the theorem, first to ""subspace cones"" and
then to general polyhedral cones and polyhedra. Thereby, we refine Minkowski's
and Carath\'eodory's theorems, two fundamental results in polyhedral geometry.
We note that, in general, elementary vectors need not be support-minimal, in
fact, they are conformally non-decomposable and form a unique minimal set of
conformal generators.
  Our treatment is mathematically rigorous, but suitable for systems
biologists, since we give self-contained proofs for our results and use
concepts motivated by metabolic pathway analysis. In particular, we study cones
defined by linear subspaces and nonnegativity conditions - like the flux cone -
and use them to analyze general polyhedral cones and polyhedra.
  Finally, we review applications of elementary vectors and conformal sums in
metabolic pathway analysis.

proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution
Promoter Capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse
embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction
networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the
chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the
association of these features to the topology of four chromatin interaction
networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network.
Polycomb Group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the
highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centred networks. We then ask which
features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters
and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the
actively elongating form of RNA Polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared to inactive
forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among
promoters, and between promoters and other elements have different
characteristic epigenomic features. We identify a possible role for the
elongating form of RNAPII in mediating interactions among promoters, enhancers
and transcribed gene bodies. Our approach facilitates the study of multiple
genome-wide epigenomic profiles, considering network topology and allowing the
comparison of chromatin interaction networks.

wave propagation. The solar observations began in 1943 with photographs of the
photosphere, drawings of sunspots, plage regions and faculae, as well as patrol
observations of the solar corona. At the beginning all data was sent to
Freiburg (Germany). After WWII international cooperation was established and
the data was sent to Zurich, Paris, Moscow and Greenwich. Relative sunspot

derived at KSO and the new International Sunspot Number (ISN) \citep{SIDC} lies
within $\sim10\%$. However, revisiting the historical data, we also find
periods with larger deviations. The reasons for the deviations were twofold:
(1) On the one hand a major instrumental change took place during which a
relocation and modification of the instrument happened. (2) On the other hand,
a period of frequent replacement of personnel caused significant deviations,
i.e. stressing the importance of experienced observers. On long-term, the
instrumental improvements led to better image quality. Additionally we find a
long term trend towards better seeing conditions since the year 2000. We may
speculate that this is related to climatic changes.

larger than 50AU is studied by a new statistical method. Speed and direction of
the relative motion are determined from the short observed arcs or known
orbits, and their joint distribution is compared to the numerical simulations.
By inverting the observed distribution with the help of simulations, we find
that average eccentricity of wide binaries is 0.59+-0.02 and the eccentricity
distribution can be modeled as f(e) ~= 1.2 e + 0.4. However, wide binaries
containing inner subsystems, i.e. triple or higher-order multiples, have
significantly smaller eccentricities with the average e = 0.52+-0.05 and the
peak at e ~ 0.5. We find that the catalog of visual orbits is strongly biased
against large eccentricities. A marginal evidence of eccentricity increasing
with separation (or period) is found for this sample. Comparison with
spectroscopic binaries proves the reality of the controversial
period-eccentricity relation. The average eccentricity does increase with
binary period, being 0.39 for periods from 10^2 to 10^3 days and 0.59 for the
binaries studied here (10^5 to 10^6 days).

at transplanckian energies ($E\gg M_P$) and small deflection angles. We show
that --- owing to the graviton's spin 2 --- such limiting form unifies the
soft- and Regge- regimes of emission, by covering a broad angular range, from
forward fragmentation to deeply central region. The single-exchange emission
amplitudes have a nice expression in terms of the transformation phases of
helicity amplitudes under rotations. As a result, the multiple-exchange
emission amplitudes can be resummed via an impact parameter $b$-space
factorization theorem that takes into account all coherence effects. We then
see the emergence of an energy spectrum of the emitted radiation which, being
tuned on $\hbar/R \sim M_P^2/E \ll M_P$, is reminiscent of Hawking's radiation.
Such a spectrum is much softer than the one na\""ively expected for increasing
input energies and neatly solves a potential energy crisis. Furthermore, by
including rescattering corrections in the (quantum) factorization formula, we
are able to recover the classical limit and to find the corresponding quantum
corrections. Perspectives for the extrapolation of such limiting radiation
towards the classical collapse regime (where $b$ is of the order of the
gravitational radius $R$) are also discussed.

describe these relations in the case when K is the boundary of a pentagon or a

spheres with two spheres in each product. Therefore H_*(\Omega Z_K) is a
one-relator algebra and we describe this one relation explicitly, therefore
giving a new homotopy-theoretical proof of McGavran's result. An interesting
feature of our relation is that it includes iterated Whitehead products which
vanish under the Hurewicz homomorphism. Therefore, the form of this relation
cannot be deduced solely from the result of McGavran.

presence of an internal global or local reservoir of liquid water beneath the
surface. While Tyler (2009, 2011) has suggested that the geological activity
and the large heat flow of Enceladus could result from tidal heating triggered
by a large obliquity of at least 0.05{\deg}-0.1{\deg}, theoretical models of
the Cassini state predict the obliquity to be two to three orders of magnitude
smaller for an entirely solid and rigid Enceladus. We investigate the influence
of an internal subsurface ocean and of tidal deformations of the solid layers
on the obliquity of Enceladus. Our Cassini state model takes into account the
external torque exerted by Saturn on each layer of the satellite and the
internal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of the
liquid layer. As a new feature, our model also includes additional torques that
arise because of the periodic tides experienced by the satellite. We find that
the upper limit for the obliquity of a solid Enceladus is 0.00045 degrees and
is negligibly affected by elastic deformations. The presence of an internal
ocean decreases this upper limit by 13.1%, elasticity attenuating this decrease
by only 0.5%. Since the obliquity of Enceladus cannot reach Tyler's
requirement, obliquity tides are unlikely to be the source of the large heat
flow of Enceladus. More likely, the geological activity at Enceladus' south
pole results from eccentricity tides. Even in the most favorable case, the
upper limit for the obliquity of Enceladus corresponds to about two meters at
most at the surface of Enceladus. This is well below the resolution of Cassini

Enceladus, let alone to constrain its interior from an obliquity measurement.

spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quasiperiodic quantum kicked rotors, a dynamical analog of
the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) emerges from an intrinsic chaotic
structure. Specifically, the inverse of the Planck's quantum ($h_e$) and the
rotor's energy growth rate mimic the `filling fraction' and the `longitudinal
conductivity' in conventional IQHE, respectively, and a hidden quantum number
is found to mimic the `quantized Hall conductivity'. We show that for an
infinite discrete set of critical values of $h_e$, the long-time energy growth
rate is universal and of order of unity (`metallic' phase), but otherwise
vanishes (`insulating' phase). Moreover, the rotor insulating phases are
topological, each of which is characterized by a hidden quantum number. This
number exhibits universal behavior for small $h_e$, i.e., it jumps by unity
whenever $h_e$ decreases, passing through each critical value. This intriguing
phenomenon is not triggered by the like of Landau band filling, well-known to
be the mechanism for conventional IQHE, and far beyond the canonical
Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs paradigm for quantum Hall transitions.
Instead, this dynamical phenomenon is of strong chaos origin; it does not occur
when the dynamics is (partially) regular. More precisely, we find that, for the
first time, a topological object, similar to the topological theta angle in
quantum chromodynamics, emerges from strongly chaotic motion at microscopic
scales, and its renormalization gives the hidden quantum number.Our analytic
results are confirmed by numerical simulations.Our findings indicate that rich
topological quantum phenomena can emerge from chaos and might point to a new

singular submanifold (leaf) embedded in a larger phase space of more general
ion acoustic waves (low-frequency electrostatic perturbations). The KP
hierarchy is characterized not only by small amplitudes but also by
irrotational (zero-vorticity) velocity fields. In fact, the KP equation is
derived by eliminating vorticity at every order of the reductive perturbation.
Here we modify the scaling of the velocity field so as to introduce a vortex
term. The newly derived system of equations consists of a generalized
three-dimensional KP equation and a two-dimensional vortex equation. The former
describes `scattering' of vortex-free waves by ambient vortexes that are
determined by the latter. We say that the vortexes are `ambient' because they
do not receive reciprocal reactions from the waves (i.e., the vortex equation
is independent of the wave fields). This model describes a minimal departure
from the integrable KP system. By the Painlev\'e test, we delineate how the
vorticity term violates integrability, bringing about an essential
three-dimensionality to the solutions. By numerical simulation, we show how the
solitons are scattered by vortexes and become chaotic.

power-divergent mixing on the lattice, provided the flow time is kept fixed in
physical units, at the expense of introducing a new physical scale in the

exploit shared structure between training data of multiple subjects and/or
sessions to increase performance. We then present a framework for transfer
learning in the context of BCIs that can be applied to any arbitrary feature
space, as well as a novel regression estimation method that is specifically
designed for the structure of a system based on the electroencephalogram (EEG).
We demonstrate the utility of our framework and method on subject-to-subject
transfer in a motor-imagery paradigm as well as on session-to-session transfer
in one patient diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), showing that
it is able to outperform other comparable methods on an identical dataset.

different dynamics and robust against noise contamination. We finally confirm
that it can be used in practice to perform unsupervised learning, by extracting
motif profiles from experimental heart-rate series and being able, accordingly,
to disentangle meditative from other relaxation states. Applications of this

microseconds. We show, using simulations of a coarse-grained model of the

order to obtain quantitative agreement with experiments for the stepping
kinetics hydrodynamic interactions (HI) have to be included. In simulations
without hydrodynamic interactions spanning nearly twenty $\mu$s not a single
step was completed in hundred trajectories. In sharp contrast, nearly 14\% of
the steps reached the target binding site within 6$\mu$s when HI were included.
Somewhat surprisingly, there are qualitative differences in the diffusion
pathways in simulations with and without HI. The extent of movement of the
trailing head of kinesin on the MT during the diffusion stage of stepping is
considerably greater in simulations with HI than in those without HI. Our
results suggest that inclusion of HI is crucial in the accurate description of

collected during the first period of operations in observing pointing mode.
Methods. For each TeV source, a search for a possible gamma-ray counterpart

data taken with the GRID instrument from July 2007 to October 2009. Results. In
case of high-significance detection, the average gamma-ray flux is estimated.

SN explosion energies span a range of $E/M=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;
\rm{erg/(10 M}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langle
E/M \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 M}_\odot$), corrected for
Malmquist bias. Assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates a
large intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. Moreover, $E/M$ is positively
correlated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ produced in the explosion, as
predicted by some recent models of core-collapse SNe. We further present
several empirical correlations. The peak magnitude is correlated with the
decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with the
rise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peak
magnitude. Faster declining SNe are more luminous and have longer rise times.
This limits the possible power sources for such events.

Numerical Relativity, motivated by its use of hyperboloidal slices - smooth
spacelike slices that reach future null infinity, the ""place"" in spacetime
where radiation is to be extracted. This is beneficial for studying the global
properties of isolated systems and unambiguously extracting their gravitational
radiation. The present approach implements the Einstein equations as a free
evolution, using the BSSN and Z4 formulations (standard in current codes)
expressed in terms of a conformally rescaled metric as suggested by Penrose,
and with a time-independent conformal factor. The main difficulty is that the
resulting system of PDEs includes formally divergent terms at null infinity
that require a special treatment. The numerical simulations in this thesis are
restricted to spherical symmetry, although the regularization in the radial
direction is expected to also apply to the full 3D case up to some extent. A
critical ingredient are the gauge conditions, which rely on well-chosen source
functions and damping terms and control the treatment of future null infinity
by means of the scri-fixing condition. Once the numerical implementation was
stabilized, stable numerical evolutions of a massless scalar field coupled to
the Einstein equations could be performed with regular and black hole trumpet
initial data on a hyperboloidal slice. The signal of the scalar field has been
successfully extracted at future null infinity. Small perturbations of regular
initial data give stationary data that are stable forever, while larger scalar
field perturbations result in the formation of a black hole. Schwarzschild
trumpet initial data have been found to slowly drift away from the expected
stationary values, but for small perturbations the effect is slow enough to
allow the observation of the power-law decay tails of the scalar field.

biological agents that participates on the dynamics of a biological phenomenon
build upon a complex network. We call this new procedure by theoretical
knock-out (KO). To devise this method, we make two approaches: algebraically
and algorithmically. In both cases we compute a vector on an asymptotic state,
called flux vector. The flux is given by a random walk on a directed graph that
represents a biological phenomenon. This vector gives us the information about
the relative flux of walkers on a vertex which represents a biological agent.
With two vector of this kind, we can calculate the relative mean error between
them by averaging over its coefficients. This quantity allows us to assess the
degree of importance of each vertex of a complex network that evolves in time
and has experimental background. We find out that this procedure can be applied
in any sort of biological phenomena in which we can know the role and
interrelationships of its agents. These results also provide experimental
biologists to predict the order of importance of biological agents on a mounted

metric and the $\Gamma$-convergence. The main contents can be divided into
three closely related parts. Firstly, on the class of upper semi-continuous
fuzzy sets with bounded $\alpha$-cuts, we find that an endograph metric
convergent sequence is exactly a $\Gamma$-convergent sequence satisfying the
condition that the union of $\alpha$-cuts of all its elements is a bounded set
in $\mathbb{R}^m$ for each $\alpha > 0$. Secondly, based on investigations of
level characterizations of fuzzy sets themselves, we present level
characterizations (level decomposition properties) of the endograph metric and
the $\Gamma$-convergence. It is worth mentioning that, using the condition and
the level characterizations given above, we discover the fact: the endograph
metric and the $\Gamma$-convergence are compatible on a large class of general
fuzzy sets which do not have any assumptions of normality, convexity or
star-shapedness. Its subsets include common particular fuzzy sets such as fuzzy
numbers (compact and noncompact), fuzzy star-shaped numbers (compact and
noncompact), and general fuzzy star-shaped numbers (compact and noncompact).
Thirdly, on the basis of the conclusions presented above, we study various
subspaces of the space of upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets with bounded
$\alpha$-cuts equipped with the endograph metric. We present characterizations
of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in these fuzzy set
spaces and clarify relationships among these fuzzy set spaces. It is pointed
out that the fuzzy set spaces of noncompact type are exactly the completions of
their compact counterparts under the endograph metric.

a heavy inextensible rope sagging both symmetrically and asymmetrically between
two steering variously-shaped guide wires without friction. In this case, the
transversality conditions lead to the orthogonality of the rope to the wires at
endpoints of the rope, which is confirmed experimentally. Freeing the endpoints

of the rope. Heavy ropes whose endpoints are free to slip between
