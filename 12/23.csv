bulk viscous transport properties of the strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma
(sQGP) and short distance hard jet transport properties in the QGP. The full
nonperturbative chromo-electric (E) and chromo-magnetic (M) structure of the
near ""perfect fluid"" like sQGP in the critical transition region are integrated
into a semi-Quark-Gluon-Monopole Plasma (sQGMP) model lattice-compatibly and
implemented into the new CUJET3.0 jet quenching framework. All observables
computed from CUJET3.0 are found to be consistent with available data at RHIC
and LHC simultaneously. A quantitative connection between the shear viscosity
and jet transport parameter is rigorously established within this framework. We
deduce the $T=160-600$ MeV dependence of the QGP's $\eta/s$: its near vanishing
value in the near $T_c$ regime is determined by the composition of E and M
charges, it increases as $T$ rises, and its high $T$ limit is fixed by color
screening scales.

The most important aspect is that the EFT is engineered to recover the Standard

the Higgs hypothesis. Additionally, I will argue that the $\kappa$ formalism
used currently by experimental collaborations to study Higgs couplings at the
LHC can actually be embedded into this EFT. This not only gives the $\kappa$

of dynamical systems, the method suggests that inflation comes in two flavors:
power-law and de Sitter. Power-law inflation seems to occur for a restricted
type of potentials, whereas de Sitter inflation has a much broader
applicability. We also show a general perturbative method, by means of series
expansion, to solve the new equations of motion around the critical point of
the de Sitter type, and how the method can be used for arbitrary models of de
Sitter inflation. It is then argued that for the latter there are two general
classes of inflationary solutions, given in terms of the behavior of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio as a function of the number $N$ of $e$-folds before the
end of inflation: $r \sim N^{-1}$ (Class I), or $r \sim N^{-2}$ (Class II). We

Heuristic attribute reduction algorithms have been presented to solve the
attribute reduction problem. It is generally known that fitness functions play
a key role in developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. The
monotonicity of fitness functions can guarantee the validity of heuristic
attribute reduction algorithms. In probabilistic rough set model, distribution
reducts can ensure the decision rules derived from the reducts are compatible
with those derived from the original decision table. However, there are few
studies on developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding
distribution reducts. This is partly due to the fact that there are no
monotonic fitness functions that are used to design heuristic attribute
reduction algorithms in probabilistic rough set model. The main objective of
this paper is to develop heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding
distribution reducts in probabilistic rough set model. For one thing, two
monotonic fitness functions are constructed, from which equivalence definitions
of distribution reducts can be obtained. For another, two modified monotonic
fitness functions are proposed to evaluate the significance of attributes more
effectively. On this basis, two heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for
finding distribution reducts are developed based on addition-deletion method
and deletion method. In particular, the monotonicity of fitness functions
guarantees the rationality of the proposed heuristic attribute reduction
algorithms. Results of experimental analysis are included to quantify the
effectiveness of the proposed fitness functions and distribution reducts.

  Let $\Omega$ be a regular, bounded and convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
There exists a finite constant $C({\Omega})>0$ such that \[
\int_{\Omega}e^{\frac{4\pi u^{2}}{H_{d}(u)}}dxdy\le C(\Omega),\;\;\forall u\in

  The main purpose of this paper is to confirm that this conjecture indeed
holds for any bounded and convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ via the Riemann
mapping theorem (the smoothness of the boundary of the domain is thus
irrelevant).
  We also give a rearrangement-free argument for the following Trudinger-Moser

$\mathbb{B}=\{z=x+iy:|z|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}<1\}$: \[
\sup_{\|u\|_{\mathcal{H}}\leq 1} \int_{\mathbb{B}}(e^{4\pi u^{2}}-1-4\pi
u^{2})dV=\sup_{\|u\|_{\mathcal{H}}\leq 1}\int_{\mathbb{B}}\frac{(e^{4\pi

employed earlier by Lam and the first author [9, 10], where $\mathcal{H}$
denotes the closure of $C^{\infty}_{0}(\mathbb{B})$ with respect to the norm
$$\|u\|_{\mathcal{H}}=\int_{\mathbb{B}}|\nabla
u|^{2}dxdy-\int_{\mathbb{B}}\frac{u^{2}}{(1-|z|^{2})^{2}}dxdy.$$ Using this
strengthened Trudinger-Moser inequality, we also give a simpler proof of the

given to the thin plasma case in which the transverse plasma size is comparable
to the typical wavelength of beam-driven oscillations. Such a case is often
implemented in laboratory beam-plasma experiments and has a number of
peculiarities. Emission from a thin plasma does not require intermediate

theory and for understanding angular momentum transport. We investigate the
potential of using a large number of similar stars simultaneously to constrain
their average radial differential rotation gradient: we call this 'ensemble
fitting'. We use a range of stellar models along the main sequence, each with a
synthetic rotation profile. The rotation profiles are step functions with a
step of -350 nHz, which is located at the base of the convection zone. These
models are used to compute the rotational splittings of the p modes and to
model their uncertainties. We then fit an ensemble of stars to infer the
average step size. All the uncertainties on the inferred step size for
individual stars are of the order 1 micro Hz. Using 15 stellar models in an
ensemble fit, we show that the uncertainty on the average step size is reduced
to less than the input step size, which allows us to constrain the sign of the
radial differential rotation. We show that a solar-like step size
(approximately 30 nHz) can be constrained by an ensemble fit of thousands of
main-sequence stars. Observing the number of stars required to successfully
exploit the ensemble fitting method will be possible with future
asteroseismology missions, such as PLATO. We demonstrate the potential of
ensemble fitting by showing that any systematic differences in the average step
size between F, G, and K-type stars larger than 100 nHz can be detected.

from sources outside the Earth-Sun system observed recently by many spacecraft
(PAMELA, FERMI, AMS2) is still a mystery with broad implications. In our
attempts to solve this mystery we have first tried to define reasonable limits
to the positrons produced in our own galaxy by nuclear interactions of cosmic
rays. This is best done by using the secondary B/C ratio produced by these same
cosmic rays in order to define the amount of matter traversed by galactic
cosmic ray nuclei. Using new values of the B/C ratio together with earlier
calculations of positron production by Moskalenko and Strong, 1998, we find
that at 10 GeV this galactic production is from 70% to almost 100% of the
positrons observed by the above experiments. At 100 GeV these fractions are
still from 20 to 33% of the positrons observed. The resulting excess positron
spectrum above this normal galactic background is found to have an exponent
-2.75, possibly flattening at lower energies. If these positrons are coming to
us from a uniform source distribution in and beyond the disk of the galaxy with
a source spectrum that is E-2.0, a spectral steepening caused by synchrotron
and inverse Compton losses, which are largest near the galactic plane, will
produce a spectrum E-2.75 at the Earth. This is similar to the excess spectrum
we find. The excess positron spectrum E-2.75 that we obtain is also very
similar to the positron spectrum produced by galactic protons in the Earths
atmosphere and in the spacecraft itself which also has a spectrum E-2.75. This
results in a background for all the above experiments. The assumption is that
this type of background is removed by the stringent criteria that are imposed
on each event. This calculation needs to be reconsidered before the
implications of these important positron results can be fully evaluated.

endpoint is a triple point connecting the deconfinement/chiral transitions in
the heavy/light quark mass regions and changes to a second-order endpoint for
intermediate masses. These regimes are separated by two tricritical values of
the quark mass, which we determine by extracting the critical exponent $\nu$
from a systematic finite size scaling analysis of the Binder cumulant of the
imaginary part of the Polyakov loop. We are able to explain a previously
observed finite size effect afflicting the scaling of the Binder cumulant in
the regime of three-phase coexistence. Compared to $N_\tau=4$ lattices, the
tricritical masses are shifted towards smaller values. Exploratory results on
$N_\tau=8$ as well as comparison with staggered simulations suggest that
significantly finer lattices are needed before a continuum extrapolation

necessitates a quantitative theoretical description for a significant number of

using classical trajectories, is suitable to describe interacting bosons,
concentrating on a single mode. Despite the nonlinear contribution from the
self-interaction, the corresponding classical dynamics allows for a largely
analytical treatment of the semiclassical propagator. We find that the
Herman-Kluk (HK) propagator conserves unitarity in the semiclassical limit
($n\to\infty$), but a decay of the norm is seen for low $n$. The frozen
Gaussian approximation (FGA, i.e. HK with unit prefactor) is explicitly shown
to violate unitarity in the present system for non-vanishing interaction
strength, even in the semiclassical limit. Furthermore, we show by evaluating
the phase space integral in steepest descent approximation, that the HK
propagator reproduces the exact spectrum correctly in the limit $n\to \infty$.
An error is, however, incurred in next-to-next-to-leading order (small
parameter $1/n$), as seen upon numerical evaluation of the integral or by
considering finite $n$ corrections to steepest descent. The FGA, in contrast,
is only accurate to lowest order, and an erroneous next-to-leading order term
in the energy spectrum was found analytically. Finally, as an example
application, we study the dynamics of wave packets by computing the time
evolution of the Wigner function. While the often-used truncated Wigner
approximation cannot capture any interferences present in the exact quantum
mechanical solution (known analytically), we find that the HK approach, despite
also using classical information only, reproduces the salient features of the
exact solution correctly.

parameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using
two-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water
distribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and
outer relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water
abundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii
of $\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5
orders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are
consistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted
by the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp
drop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local
gas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase
chemical pathways to water below 300 K. Assuming a canonical gas-to-dust ratio
of 100, as well as coupled gas and dust temperatures $T_{\rm gas}=T_{\rm
dust}$, the best-fit inner water abundances become implausibly high (0.01-1.0

are decoupled leads to canonical inner disk water abundances of $\sim 10^{-4}

1-loop power spectrum. Furthermore, we find that as a consequence of the
nonlinear evolution, the free-streaming length is shifted towards larger
scales, wiping out more structure than that expected in linear theory.
Therefore, we argue that the formalism developed here is better suited for a
perturbation treatment of warm dark matter or neutrino clustering, where the
velocity dispersion effects are well known to be important. We discuss
implications related to the nature of dark matter.

networked control system through a limited stabilizing input information. The
system is primarily affected by the time-varying, norm bounded, mismatched
parametric uncertainty. The input information is limited due to unreliability
of communicating networks. An event-triggered based robust control strategy is
adopted to capture the network unreliability. In event-triggered control the
control input is computed and updated at the system end only when a
pre-specified event condition is violated. The robust control input is derived
to stabilize the uncertain system by solving an optimal control problem based
on a virtual nominal dynamics and a modified cost-functional. The designed
robust control law with limited information ensures input-to-sate stability
(ISS) of original system under presence of mismatched uncertainty. Deriving the
event-triggering condition for discrete-time uncertain system and ensuring the
stability of such system analytically are the key contributions of this paper.
A numerical example is given to prove the efficacy of the proposed event-based
control algorithm over the conventional periodic one.

considered as a universal fingerprint of the dynamic response of a liquid,

the observed GRB event rate in the local universe and requiring that at least 3

$\sim$ (0.10-0.25) per century for GRB-related NDAFs by the Hyper-Kamiokande

the highest sensitivity of the three, does show a positive spectral residual

universe on small scales - providing the only constraints on the primordial
power spectrum on the majority of scales. However, these constraints are
strongly dependent on even small amounts of non-Gaussianity, which is
unconstrained on scales significantly smaller than those visible in the CMB.
This paper goes beyond previous considerations to consider the effects of a
bispectrum of the equilateral, orthogonal and local shapes with arbitrary
magnitude upon the abundance of primordial black holes. Non-Gaussian density
maps of the early universe are generated from a given bispectrum and used to
place constraints on the small scale power spectrum. When small, we show that
the skewness provides an accurate estimate for how the constraint depends on
non-Gaussianity, independently of the shape of the bispectrum. We show that the
orthogonal template of non-Gaussianity has an order of magnitude weaker effect
on the constraints than the local and equilateral templates.

function of transverse momentum, ${p_{\rm T}}$, in p-Pb collisions at a

common rapidity interval -0.5 $<{y_{\rm CMS}}<$ 0. Multi-strange baryons have
been identified by reconstructing their weak decays into charged particles. The
${p_{\rm T}}$ spectra are analysed as a function of event charged-particle
multiplicity, which in p-Pb collisions ranges over one order of magnitude and
lies between those observed in pp and Pb-Pb collisions. The measured ${p_{\rm

The parameters which describe the production of lighter hadron species also
describe the hyperon spectra in high multiplicity p-Pb. The yield of hyperons
relative to charged pions is studied and compared with results from pp and
Pb-Pb collisions. A statistical model is employed, which describes the change
in the ratios with volume using a canonical suppression mechanism, in which the
small volume causes a species-dependent relative reduction of hadron
production. The calculations, in which the magnitude of the effect depends on
the strangeness content, show good qualitative agreement with the data.

difference can be traced back to a general dependence of the perturbative

spurious frame dependence by invoking so-called Lorentz invariance relations
(LIRs) between twist-3 parton correlation functions. Some of those relations
for twist-3 distribution functions were discussed in the literature before. In
this paper we derive the corresponding LIRs for twist-3 fragmentation
functions. We explicitly demonstrate that these LIRs remove the lightcone
vector dependence by considering transverse spin observables in the
single-inclusive production of hadrons in lepton-nucleon collisions, $\ell N\to
hX$. With the LIRs in hand, we also show that twist-3 observables in general

The multi-spinon states are labelled by a collection $\{ n_j \}$ of (discrete)
momenta. The state-content for given choice of $\{ n_j \}$ is determined
through a generalised exclusion principle, similar to Haldane's `motif' rules
for the $SU(n)_1$ theories. In the simplest case, which is the ${\cal N}=2$
superconformal theory with central charge $c=1$, we develop an algebraic
framework similar to the Yangian symmetry of the $SU(2)_1$ theory. It includes
an operator $H_2$, akin to a CFT Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian, which is
diagonalised by multi-spinon states. In all cases studied, we obtain finite
partition sums by capping the spinon-momenta to some finite value. For the
$\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal CFTs, this finitisation precisely leads to the
so-called M$_k$ supersymmetric lattice models with characteristic order-$k$

boson, as a pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson (pNGB) of a spontaneously broken
global symmetry, and flavour physics via the partial compositeness mechanism.
If the dynamics is generated by a confining gauge group with fermionic matter
content, there exists only a finite set of models that have the correct
properties to account for the Higgs and top partners at the same time. In this
letter we explore the theory space of this class of models: remarkably, all of
them contain - beyond the pNGB Higgs - a pNGB singlet, $a$, which couples to
Standard Model gauge bosons via Wess-Zumino-Witten interactions, thus providing
naturally a resonance in di-boson at the LHC. With the assumption that the
recently reported di-photon excess at 750 GeV at the LHC arises from the
a-resonance, we propose a generic approach on how to delineate the best
candidate for composite Higgs models with top-partners. We find that
constraints from other di-boson searches severely reduce the theory space of
the models under consideration. For the models which can explain the di-photon
excess, we make precise and testable predictions for the width and other
di-boson resonance searches.

with mass around 750 GeV can simultaneously explain the solar anomaly and the
recent diphoton excess observed by both ATLAS and CMS experiments in the early

is naturally large, as suggested by the ATLAS experiment, since the resonance
mostly decays to the ADM pair. The model predicts the existence of a new light

modeled by a multinomial logit with social influence and position bias. The
social signal for a product is given by its current market share raised to
power r (or equivalently the number of purchases raised to the power of r). The
paper shows that, when r is strictly between 0 and 1, and a static position
assignment (e.g., a quality ranking) is used, the market converges to a unique
equilibrium where the market shares depend only on product quality, not their
initial appeals or the early dynamics. When r is greater than 1, the market
becomes unpredictable. In many cases, the market goes to a monopoly for some
product: Which product becomes a monopoly depends on the initial conditions of
the market. These theoretical results are complemented by an agent-based
simulation which indicates that convergence is fast when r is between 0 and 1,
and that the quality ranking dominates the well-known popularity ranking in
terms of market efficiency. These results shed a new light on the role of
social influence which is often blamed for unpredictability, inequalities, and
inefficiencies in markets. In contrast, this paper shows that, with a proper
social signal and position assignment for the products, the market becomes
predictable, and inequalities and inefficiencies can be controlled
appropriately.

currencies, in that protection upon default may be offered either in the
domestic currency where the entity resides, or in a more liquid and global
foreign currency. In this situation currency fluctuations clearly introduce a
source of risk on CDS spreads. For emerging markets, but in some cases even in
well developed markets, the risk of dramatic Foreign Exchange (FX) rate
devaluation in conjunction with default events is relevant. We address this
issue by proposing and implementing a model that considers the risk of foreign
currency devaluation that is synchronous with default of the reference entity.
  Preliminary results indicate that perceived risks of devaluation can induce a
significant basis across domestic and foreign CDS quotes. For the Republic of
Italy, a USD CDS spread quote of 440 bps can translate into a EUR quote of 350
bps in the middle of the Euro-debt crisis in the first week of May 2012. More
recently, from June 2013, the basis spreads between the EUR quotes and the USD
quotes are in the range around 40 bps.
  We explain in detail the sources for such discrepancies. Our modeling
approach is based on the reduced form framework for credit risk, where the
default time is modeled in a Cox process setting with explicit diffusion
dynamics for default intensity/hazard rate and exponential jump to default. For
the FX part, we include an explicit default-driven jump in the FX dynamics. As
our results show, such a mechanism provides a further and more effective way to
model credit / FX dependency than the instantaneous correlation that can be
imposed among the driving Brownian motions of default intensity and FX rates,
as it is not possible to explain the observed basis spreads during the
Euro-debt crisis by using the latter mechanism alone.

stellar and planetary populations. We expect to find $3.0^{+3.3}_{-1.6}$ hot
Jupiters around F, G, and K dwarfs with periods lower than 10 days based on the
planet occurrence rates derived in previous surveys. For M dwarfs, the
percentage of stars with a hot Jupiter is under debate. Theoretical models
expect a lower occurrence rate than for larger main sequence stars. However,
radial velocity surveys find upper limits of about 1\% due to their small
sample, while the Kepler survey finds a occurrence rate that we estimate to be

for high-dimensional count-valued data. Our primary interest is when there are
possibly millions of data points referenced over different variables,
geographic regions, and times. This problem requires extensive methodological
advancements, as jointly modeling correlated data of this size leads to the
so-called ""big n problem."" The computational complexity of prediction in this
setting is further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are
naturally non-Gaussian. Thus, we develop a new computationally efficient
distribution theory for this setting. In particular, we introduce a
multivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial theoretical
development including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal
distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal
distribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To
incorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a
multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. The results in
this manuscript are extremely general, and can be used for data that exhibit
fewer sources of dependency than what we consider (e.g., multivariate,
spatial-only, or spatio-temporal-only data). Hence, the implications of our
modeling framework may have a large impact on the general problem of jointly
modeling correlated count-valued data. We show the effectiveness of our
approach through a simulation study. Additionally, we demonstrate our proposed
methodology with an important application analyzing data obtained from the

effect of mimetic scalar aiming to describe dark matter on mass-radius relation
and the moment of inertia for slowly rotating relativistic stars. The
mass-radius relation and moment of inertia depend on the value of mimetic
scalar in the center of star. This fact leads to the ambiguity in the
mass-radius relation for a given equation of state. {Such ambiguity allows to
explain some observational facts better than in standard General Relativity}.
The case of two mimetic potentials namely $V(\phi)\sim A\phi^{-2}$ and
$V(\phi)\sim Ae^{B\phi^{2}}$ is considered in detail. The relative deviation of
maximal moment of inertia is approximately twice larger than the relative
deviation of maximal stellar mass. We also briefly discuss the mimetic $f(R)$
gravity. In the case of $f(R)=R+aR^2$ mimetic gravity it is expected that
increase of maximal mass and maximal moment of inertia due to mimetic scalar
becomes much stronger with bigger parameter $a$. The contribution of scalar
field in mimetic gravity can lead to possible existence of extreme neutron

of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of this channel is established, with $N_t$ antennas at
the transmitter, $N_r$ antennas at the legitimate receiver, and $N_e$ antennas
at the eavesdropper, for all possible values of the number of antennas, $N_c$,
at the cooperative jammer. In establishing the result, several different ranges
of $N_c$ need to be considered separately. The lower and upper bounds for these
ranges of $N_c$ are derived, and are shown to be tight. The achievability
techniques developed rely on a variety of signaling, beamforming, and alignment
techniques which vary according to the (relative) number of antennas at each
terminal and whether the s.d.o.f. is integer valued. Specifically, it is shown
that, whenever the s.d.o.f. is integer valued, Gaussian signaling for both
transmission and cooperative jamming, linear precoding at the transmitter and
the cooperative jammer, and linear processing at the legitimate receiver, are
sufficient for achieving the s.d.o.f. of the channel. By contrast, when the
s.d.o.f. is not an integer, the achievable schemes need to rely on structured
signaling at the transmitter and the cooperative jammer, and joint signal space
and signal scale alignment. The converse is established by combining an upper
bound which allows for full cooperation between the transmitter and the
cooperative jammer, with another upper bound which exploits the secrecy and
reliability constraints.

the surface composition (Cordier et al., 2013), we provide some answers to
these questions derived from a new model. This model, based on the up-to-date
thermodynamic theory known as ""PC-SAFT"", has been validated with available

confirm the possibility of an acetylene and/or butane enriched central layer of
evaporitic deposit. The estimated thickness of this acetylene-butane layer
could explain the strong RADAR brightness of the evaporites. The 2-D
computations indicate an accumulation of poorly soluble species at the

play a dominant role. Our model predicts the existence of chemically trimodal

form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content
displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These
spurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space
statistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid
size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient estimates
for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under

include the dominant contribution to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the
choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the FFT
grid and demonstrate that using higher-order interpolation kernels than the
standard Cloud in Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the

interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases of density
perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that

understanding of the underlying convection dynamics. We present results of
realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of the outer layers of a

overshoot region, and the top layers of the radiative zone. The simulation
results show that the surface granulation has a broad range of scales, from 2
to 12 Mm, and that large granules are organized in well-defined clusters,
consisting of several granules. Comparison of the mean structure profiles from
3D simulations with the corresponding 1D standard stellar model shows an
increase of the stellar radius by ~800 km, as well as significant changes in
the thermodynamic structure and turbulent properties of the ionization zones.
Convective downdrafts in the intergranular lanes between granulation clusters
reach speeds of more than 20 km/s, penetrate through the whole convection zone,
hit the radiative zone, and form a 8 Mm thick overshoot layer. Contrary to
semi-empirical overshooting models, our results show that the 3D dynamic
overshoot region consists of two layers: a nearly adiabatic extension of the
convection zone and a deeper layer of enhanced subadiabatic stratification.
This layer is formed because of heating caused by the braking of the
overshooting convective plumes. This effect has to be taken into account in
stellar modeling and the interpretation of asteroseismology data. In
particular, we demonstrate that the 3D model can qualitatively explain
deviations from the standard solar model found by helioseismology.

eV) and extremely high (>10$^{18}$ eV) energy neutrinos in water or other dense
medium has been elaborated. The lateral spread of high-energy particles in
cascades due to Coulomb scattering is negligible. So it is possible to use an
approximation of the one-dimensional development of the UHE (or EHE) cascade if
energies of particles in it higher than 10-100 GeV. An original program of the
one-dimensional development of UHE and EHE cascades in dense media taking into
account fluctuations and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect has been
elaborated. The GEANT4 package has been used when particle energies are below
1000 GeV, for example, or less to calculate correctly the longitudinal
distribution of an energy deposition by charge particles in a cascade. In
advance the library of longitudinal characteristics of cascades was calculated.
When a particle with the energy E which is below the threshold energy (E<1000
GeV or E<10$^6$ GeV) appears in the basic Monte Carlo program, the longitudinal
distribution of an energy deposition induced by it was taken from the library
and was added into the corresponding places of the basic distribution. The
results of simulation of cascades in a dense medium can be used for
calculations of acoustical or radio signals.

poster, we present a highly concurrent and scalable design of phasers for a
distributed memory environment that is suitable for use with asynchronous
partitioned global address space programming models. Our design for a
distributed phaser employs a pair of skip lists augmented with the ability to
collect and propagate synchronization signals. To enable a high degree of
concurrency, addition and deletion of participant tasks are performed in two
phases: a ""fast single-link-modify"" step followed by multiple hand-overhand
""lazy multi-link-modify"" steps. We show that the cost of synchronization and
structural operations on a distributed phaser scales logarithmically, even in
the presence of concurrent structural modifications. To verify the correctness
of our design for distributed phasers, we employ the SPIN model checker. To
address this issue of state space explosion, we describe how we decompose the
state space to separately verify correct handling for different kinds of

decades, but with a patchwork of electrical standards. Electromotive force was
for the most part measured in units of the predominant Daniell cell. Each
company had their own resistance standard. In 1862 the British Association for
the Advancement of Science formed a committee to address this situation. By
1873 they had given definition to the electromagnetic system of units (emu) and
defined the practical units of the ohm as ${10}^9$ emu units of resistance and
the volt as ${10}^8$ emu units of electromotive force. These recommendations
were ratified and expanded upon in a series of international congresses held
between 1881 and 1904. A proposal by Giovanni Giorgi in 1901 took advantage of
a coincidence between the conversion of the units of energy in the emu system
(the erg) and in the practical system (the joule) in that the same conversion
factor existed between the cgs based emu system and a theretofore undefined MKS
system. By introducing another unit, X (where X could be any of the practical
electrical units), Giorgi demonstrated that a self consistent MKSX system was
tenable without the need for multiplying factors. Ultimately the ampere was
selected as the fourth unit. It took nearly 60 years, but in 1960 Giorgi's
proposal was incorporated as the core of the newly inaugurated International
System of Units (SI). This article surveys the physics, physicists and events

their fitness, particularly when collective motion starts and stops.
Understanding the decision-making at individual and collective levels upon
sudden disturbances is central in the study of collective animal behavior, and
concerns the broader question of how information is distributed and evaluated
in groups. Despite the relevance of the problem, well-controlled experimental
studies that quantify the collective response of groups facing disruptive
events are lacking. Here we study the behavior of groups of uninformed
individuals subject to the departure and stop of a trained conspecific within
small-sized groups. We find that the groups reach an effective consensus:
either all uninformed individuals follow the trained one (and collective motion
occurs) or none does it. Combining experiments and a simple mathematical model
we show that the observed phenomena results from the interplay between simple
mimetic rules and the characteristic duration of the stimulus, here, the time
the trained individual is moving away. The proposed mechanism strongly depends
on group size, as observed in the experiments, and though group splitting can
occur, the most likely outcome is always a coherent collective group response
(consensus). The prevalence of a consensus is expected even if the groups of
naives face conflicting information, e.g. if groups contain two subgroups of
trained individuals, one trained to stay and one trained to leave. Our results
indicate that collective decision-making and consensus in (small) animal groups
are likely to be self-organized phenomena that do not involve concertation or
even communication among the group members.

by the trade-off between throughput and the width of the entrance slit.
Photonic guided-wave transitions have been proposed as a route to bypass this
trade-off, by enabling the efficient reformatting of incoherent seeing-limited
light collected by the telescope into a linear array of single modes: a
pseudo-slit which is highly multimode in one axis but diffraction-limited in
the dispersion axis of the spectrograph. It is anticipated that the size of a
single-object spectrograph fed with light in this manner would be essentially
independent of the telescope aperture size. A further anticipated benefit is
that such spectrographs would be free of `modal noise', a phenomenon that
occurs in high-resolution multimode fibre-fed spectrographs due to the coherent
nature of the telescope point-spread-function (PSF). We address these aspects
by integrating a multicore fibre photonic lantern with an ultrafast laser
inscribed three-dimensional waveguide interconnect to spatially reformat the
modes within the PSF into a diffraction-limited pseudo-slit. Using the CANARY
adaptive optics (AO) demonstrator on the William Herschel Telescope, and 1530
$\pm$ 80 nm stellar light, the device is found to exhibit a transmission of
47-53 % depending upon the mode of AO correction applied. We also show the
advantage of using AO to couple light into such a device by sampling only the
core of the CANARY PSF. This result underscores the possibility that a
fully-optimised guided-wave device can be used with AO to provide efficient
spectroscopy at high spectral resolution.

The network consists of one source, an arbitrary number of relay nodes,

security. We propose an algorithm to select a set of relay nodes to enhance the
legitimate users' transmission and another set of relay nodes to perform
jamming of the eavesdroppers. With Inter-Relay interference (IRI) taken into
account, interference cancellation can be implemented to assist the
transmission of the legitimate users. Secondly, IRI can also be used to further
increase the level of harm of the jamming signal to the eavesdroppers. By
exploiting the fact that the jamming signal can be stored at the relay nodes,
we also propose a hybrid algorithm to set a signal-to-interference and noise
ratio (SINR) threshold at the node to determine the type of signal stored at
the relay node. With this separation, the signals with high SINR are delivered
to the users as conventional relay systems and the low SINR performance signals
are stored as potential jamming signals. Simulation results show that the
proposed techniques obtain a significant improvement in secrecy rate over

caching in routers. It enables routers to satisfy content requests with

  One major drawback of in-network caching is that content producers have no
knowledge about where their content is stored. This is problematic if a
producer wishes to delete its content. In this paper, we show how to address
this problem with a protocol called BEAD (Best-Effort Autonomous Deletion).
BEAD achieves content deletion via small and secure packets that resemble

efficacy. We assess BEAD performance via simulations and provide a detailed

nanowires were obtained by metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)
and contacted using electronic-beam lithography. Depending on the contact
geometry, good quality ohmic contacts (linear I V behavior) or non-linear
(diode like) Schottky contacts were obtained. Current voltage and KPFM
measurements on both types of contacted ZnO nanowires were performed in order
to investigate their behavior. A clear correlation could be established between
the I V curve, the electrical potential profile along the device and the
nanowire geometry. Some arguments supporting this behavior are given based on a
depleted region extension. This work will help to better understand the
electrical behavior of ohmic contacts on single ZnO nanowires, for future
applications in nanoscale field effect-transistors and nano-photodetectors.

number's owner (victim) on the attack channels (over-the-top or OTT messaging
applications, voice, e-mail, or SMS), and finally targets the victim on the

1.16 million phone numbers. By using information provided by popular
applications, we show that social and spear phishing attacks can be launched
against 51,409 and 180,000 users respectively. Furthermore, voice phishing or

determines the orientation of minimal directional sensors so that each target

heuristics provide imbalance coverage of the targets--some targets are covered
$k$ times while others are left totally uncovered or singly covered. The
coverage imbalance is more serious in under-provisioned networks where there do
not exist enough sensors to cover all the targets $k$ times. Therefore, we
address the problem of covering each target at least $k$ times in a balanced

local-rest-frame momentum. We then prove that the SO(3)_q symmetry in de Sitter
space constrains the anisotropy tensor to be of spheroidal form with only one
independent anisotropy parameter remaining. As a consequence, the exact
solution reduces to the problem of solving two coupled non-linear differential
equations. We show that, in the limit that the relaxation time goes to zero,
one obtains Gubser's ideal hydrodynamic solution and, in the limit that the
relaxation time goes to infinity, one obtains the exact free streaming solution
obtained originally by Denicol et al. For finite relaxation time, we solve the
equations numerically and compare to the exact solution of the

providing a principled and effective way to extract underlying patterns,
structure and knowledge from observed data. Due to the dramatic growth of
volume and complexity of data, several new challenges have emerged and cannot
be effectively addressed by existing LVMs: (1) How to capture long-tail
patterns that carry crucial information when the popularity of patterns is
distributed in a power-law fashion? (2) How to reduce model complexity and
computational cost without compromising the modeling power of LVMs? (3) How to
improve the interpretability and reduce the redundancy of discovered patterns?
To addresses the three challenges discussed above, we develop a novel
regularization technique for LVMs, which controls the geometry of the latent
space during learning to enable the learned latent components of LVMs to be
diverse in the sense that they are favored to be mutually different from each
other, to accomplish long-tail coverage, low redundancy, and better
interpretability. We propose a mutual angular regularizer (MAR) to encourage
the components in LVMs to have larger mutual angles. The MAR is non-convex and
non-smooth, entailing great challenges for optimization. To cope with this
issue, we derive a smooth lower bound of the MAR and optimize the lower bound
instead. We show that the monotonicity of the lower bound is closely aligned
with the MAR to qualify the lower bound as a desirable surrogate of the MAR.
Using neural network (NN) as an instance, we analyze how the MAR affects the
generalization performance of NN. On two popular latent variable models ---
restricted Boltzmann machine and distance metric learning, we demonstrate that
MAR can effectively capture long-tail patterns, reduce model complexity without
sacrificing expressivity and improve interpretability.

replicated, leaving out no IR01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained
by applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to
counterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a
liability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of
funding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is
redefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total valuation
adjustment, coherent with CVA, the default risk component. A Longstaff-Schwartz
style least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the
recursive fair value and adjustments. A separately developed finite difference
scheme is used to test and find regression necessary to decouple the discount
rate switch. Preliminary results show the impact of counterparty risk to swap
hedge ratios, swap bid/ask spreads, and valuation adjustments, and considerable
errors of calculating CVA by discounting cash flow or potential future
exposure.

phosphorus nanotube (BPNT) also can theoretically be produced by curling the
rectangular single-layer black phosphorus (SLBP). In present study, the effect
of thermal vibration of atoms on the failure of a BPNT is investigated using
molecular dynamics simulations. Two types of double-shell BPNTs, which are
obtained by curling the rectangular SLBP along its armchair/pucker direction
and zigzag direction (in-plane normal) respectively, are involved in
simulation. At finite temperature, a bond on the outer shell of tube is under
tension due to both of curvature of tube and serious thermal vibration of
atoms. As the length of a bond with such elongation approaches its critical
value, i.e., 0.279 nm, or the smallest distance between two nonbonding
phosphorus atoms is over 0.389nm caused by great variation of bond angle, the
tube fails quickly. The critical stable states of either an armchair or a
zigzag BPNT at finite temperature are calculated and compared. To achieve a
stable BPNT with high robustness, the curvature of the tube should be reduced
or the tube should work at a lower temperature. Only when the BPNT has
structural stability, it has a potential application as a nanowire in a future
nano electro-mechanical system (NEMS).

scaling (DVS) to fixed-priority scheduling algorithms with task-splitting for
periodic real-time tasks on multi-core processors. The first strategy
determines voltage scales for each processor after scheduling (Static DVS),
which ensures all tasks meet the timing requirements on synchronization. The
second strategy adaptively determines the frequency of each task before
scheduling (Adaptive DVS) according to the total utilization of task-set and
number of cores available. The combination of frequency pre-allocation and
task-splitting makes it possible to maximize energy savings with DVS.
Simulation results show that it is possible to achieve significant energy
savings with DVS while preserving the schedulability requirements of real-time
schedulers for multi-core processors.

voids, filaments, sheets and knots of galaxy clusters. These structures
participate differently in the global expansion of the Universe: from
non-expanding clusters to the above average expansion rate of voids. In this
paper we characterize Hubble expansion anisotropies in the COMPOSITE sample of
4534 galaxies and clusters. We concentrate on the dipole and quadrupole in the
rest frame of the Local Group. These both have statistically significant
amplitudes. These anisotropies, and their redshift dependence, cannot be
explained solely by a boost of the Local Group in the
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model which expands isotropically
in the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. We
simulate the local expansion of the Universe with inhomogeneous Szekeres
models, which match the standard FLRW model on $> 100~h^{-1}$ Mpc scales but
exhibit nonkinematic relativistic differential expansion on small scales. We
restrict models to be consistent with observed CMB temperature anisotropies,
while simultaneously fitting the redshift variation of the Hubble expansion
dipole. We include features to account for both the Local Void and the ""Great
Attractor"". While this naturally accounts for the Hubble expansion and CMB
dipoles, the simulated quadrupoles are smaller than observed. Further
refinement to incorporate additional structures may improve this. This would
enable a test of the hypothesis that some large angle CMB anomalies result from
failing to treat the relativistic differential expansion of the background
geometry, a natural feature of solutions to Einstein's equations not included
in the current standard model of cosmology.

superconductivity in sulfur hydrides is why high pressure phases of H3S have
extremely high Tc's. Recently, it has been pointed out that the presence of the
van Hove singularities (vHs) around the Fermi level is crucial. However, while
there have been quantitative estimates of Tc based on the Migdal-Eliashberg
theory, the energy dependence of the density of states (DOS) has been neglected
to simplify the Eliashberg equation. In this study, we go beyond the constant
DOS approximation and explicitly consider the electronic structure over 40eV
around the Fermi level. In contrast with the previous conventional
calculations, this approach with a sufficiently large number of Matsubara
frequencies enables us to calculate Tc without introducing the empirical pseudo
Coulomb potential. We show that while H3S has much higher Tc than H2S for which
the vHs is absent, the constant DOS approximation employed so far seriously
overestimates (underestimates) Tc by ~ 60K (~ 10K) for H3S (H2S). We then
discuss the impact of the strong electron-phonon coupling on the electronic
structure with and without the vHs and how it affects the superconductivity.
Especially, we focus on (1) the feedback effect in the self-consistent
calculation of the self-energy, (2) the effect of the energy shift due to the
zero-point motion, and (3) the effect of the changes in the phonon frequencies
due to strong anharmonicity. We show that the effect of (1)-(3) on Tc is about
10-30K for both H3S and H2S. Eventually, Tc is estimated to be 181K for H3S at
250GPa and 34K for H2S at 140GPa, which explains the pressure dependence of Tc
observed in the experiment. In addition, we evaluate the lowest order vertex
correction beyond the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and discuss the validity of the
Migdal approximation for sulfur hydrides.

Consequently, we fed the characteristic timbre of the particular instrument

expected to be pair produced in association with a Standard Model particle. The

Dark Matter which the traditional detection fail to detect due to the small
momentum transfer involved in the interaction; on the other hand, the
traditional detection is robust in detecting a higher Dark matter masses but
the collider is su ered from the parton distribution function suppression.
Topologically the processes are similar to the scattering processes in the
direct detection thus complementary to the traditional Dark Matter detection.
The collider searches are strongly motivated as the results are usually
translated to the annihilation and scattering rates at more traditional Dark

  Version 2",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article, we re-examine some of the classical pointwise multiplication
theorems in Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces, in part motivated by a simple
counter-example that illustrates how certain multiplication theorems fail in
Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces when a bounded domain is replaced by Rn. We identify
the source of the failure, and examine why the same failure is not encountered
in Bessel potential spaces. To analyze the situation, we begin with a survey of
the classical multiplication results stated and proved in the 1977 article of
Zolesio, and carefully distinguish between the case of spaces defined on the
all of Rn and spaces defined on a bounded domain (with e.g. a Lipschitz
boundary). However, the survey we give has a few new wrinkles; the proofs we
include are based almost exclusively on interpolation theory rather than
Littlewood-Paley theory and Besov spaces, and some of the results we give and
their proofs, including the results for negative exponents, do not appear in
the literature in this form. We also include a particularly important variation
of one of the multiplication theorems that is relevant to the study of
nonlinear PDE systems arising in general relativity and other areas. The
conditions for multiplication to be continuous in the case of
Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces are somewhat subtle and intertwined, and as a
result, the multiplication theorems of Zolesio in 1977 have been cited (more
than once) in the standard literature in slightly more generality than what is
actually proved by Zolesio, and in cases that allow for the construction of
counter-examples such as the one included here.

Greenland Ice Core Project displays fluctuation levels that increase as one
approaches the onset of an interstadial (warm) period. For some of the events
it is possible to establish statistical significance using Monte-Carlo
simulations with a non-parametric null model with random phases and the same
spectral density as the $\delta^{18}\mbox{O}$ record during the stadial
periods. Similar results are found for the locally estimated Hurst exponent for
the high-frequency fluctuations, and it is therefore natural to interpret these
findings as so-called ""critical slowing down"" signatures, i.e. early-warning
signs of tipping points. The observed ""slowing down"" is found to be similar
(and perhaps even stronger) in the Younger Dryas, suggesting that there are
some similarities between mechanisms of the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition
and the onsets of the Greenland interstadials. It is also verified that the
temperature fluctuations during the last glacial period are characterized by
long-range dependence, where the stadial periods can be approximately modeled
as a $1/f$-noise. Persistent processes can take shape if the physical signal is
an aggregation of several different processes, where each process responds to
perturbations on a certain characteristic time scale. The results are
consistent with the hypothesis that both the onsets of the Greenland
interstadials and the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition are caused by tipping
points in dynamical processes with characteristic time scale of the order of
decades, and that the variability of other processes on longer time scales mask
the early-warning signatures in the $\delta^{18}\mbox{O}$ signal.

is usually adopted in modern cosmology without direct observational evidence.
However, the history of ionization fraction, $x_e(z)$ will influence cosmic

With the mocked future data sets based on featured reionization model, we find
the bias on $\tau$ introduced by instantaneous model can not be neglected. In
this paper, we study the cosmic reionization history in a model independent
way, the so called principle component analysis (PCA) method, and reconstruct

temperature and polarization power spectra, combining with the baryon acoustic

get stronger constraints, and the hints for featured $x_e(z)$ evolution could

form a flexible family for approximation in total variation, in much the same
way that the normal family is used for approximation in Kolmogorov distance.
Using the Stein--Chen method, approximation can often be achieved with error
bounds of the same order as those for the CLT. In this paper, an analogous
theory, again based on Stein's method, is developed in the multivariate
context. The approximating family consists of the equilibrium distributions of
a collection of Markov jump processes, whose analogues in one dimension are the
immigration--death processes with Poisson distributions as equilibria. The
method is illustrated by providing total variation error bounds for the
approximation of the equilibrium distribution of one Markov jump process by
that of another. In a companion paper, it is shown how to use the method for
discrete normal approximation in ${\mathbb Z}^d$.

role in understanding quantum theory since the work of Einstein, Podolsky and
Rosen (1935). Tsirelson (1980) proved that Bell states, shared among two
parties, when measured suitably, achieve the maximum non-local correlations
allowed by quantum mechanics. Conversely, Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013)
showed that observing the maximal correlation value over a sequence of repeated
measurements, implies that the underlying quantum state is close to a tensor
product of maximally entangled states and, moreover, that it is measured
according to an ideal strategy. However, this strong rigidity result comes at a
high price, requiring a large number of entangled pairs to be tested. In this
paper, we present a significant improvement in terms of the overhead by instead
considering quantum steering where the device of the one side is trusted. We
first demonstrate a robust one-sided device-independent version of
self-testing, which characterises the shared state and measurement operators of
two parties up to a certain bound. We show that this bound is optimal up to
constant factors and we generalise the results for the most general attacks.
This leads us to a rigidity theorem for maximal steering correlations. As a key
application we give a one-sided device-independent protocol for verifiable
delegated quantum computation, and compare it to other existing protocols, to
highlight the cost of trust assumptions. Finally, we show that under reasonable
assumptions, the states shared in order to run a certain type of verification
protocol must be unitarily equivalent to perfect Bell states.

we obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the charge/mass ratio

if the electron were either less massive (with the same charge) or if its
charge were any higher (for fixed mass), a combination of electrostatic and

flow from a quasi-2D random porous medium. The medium is transparent, which
allows for the direct visualization of the invasion pattern during flow, and is
initially saturated with a viscous liquid (a dyed glycerol-water mix). As the
pressure in the liquid is gradually reduced, air penetrates from an open inlet,
displacing the liquid which leaves the system from an outlet on the opposite
side. Pressure measurements and images of the flow are recorded and the
pressure-saturation relationship is computed. We show that this relationship
depends on the system size and aspect ratio. The effects of the system's
boundaries on this relationship are measured experimentally and compared with
simulations produced using an invasion percolation algorithm. The pressure
build up at the beginning and end of the invasion process are particularly
affected by the boundaries of the system whereas at the central part of the
model (when the air front progresses far from these boundaries), the invasion
happens at a statistically constant capillary pressure. These observations have
led us to propose a much simplified pressure-saturation relationship, valid for
systems that are large enough such that the invasion is not influenced by
boundary effects. The properties of this relationship depend on the capillary
pressure thresholds distribution, sample dimensions and average pore
connectivity and its applications may be of particular interest for simulations
of two-phase flow in large porous media.

consists of two parts, describing the two main physical effects. The first part
represents the elastic energy of the film, which is approximated using the von
K\'arm\'an plate theory. The second part represents the fracture or
delamination energy, which is approximated using the Griffith model of
fracture. A simpler model containing the first term alone was previously
studied with similar methods by several authors, assuming that the delaminated

minimization into a free-boundary problem, and opening the way for patterns
which result from the interplay of elasticity and delamination.
  After rescaling, the energy depends on only two parameters: the rescaled film
thickness, $\sigma$, and a measure of the bonding strength between the film and

$\sigma^a \gamma^b$ and find that there are four different parameter regimes

uniformly distributed around the central galaxies. 3-color photometry including
the U-band reveals that some of them are of intermediate age. Their location
coincides with a group of dwarf galaxies under disruption. This is evidence of
a structurally young stellar halo 'still in formation', which is also supported
by kinematic measurements of the halo light that point to a kinematically
disturbed system. The most massive GCs divide into generally more extended
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and genuine compact GCs. In both clusters,
the spatial distribution and kinematics of UCDs are different from those of

Mathematically, diffusion equations are partial differential equations
describing the fluid-like large-scale dynamics of parcels of molecules.
Spatially inhomogeneous systems affect in a position-dependent way the average
motion of molecules; thus, diffusion equations have to reflect somehow this
fact within their structure. It is known since long that in this case an
ambiguity arises: there are several ways of writing down diffusion equations
containing space dependence within their parameters. These ways are all
potentially valid but not equivalent, meaning that the different diffusion
equations yield different solutions for the same data. The ambiguity can only
be resolved at the microscopic level: a model for the stochastic dynamics of
the individual molecules must be provided, and a well-defined diffusion
equation then arises as the long-wavelength limit of this dynamics. In this
work we introduce and employ the integro-differential Master Equation (ME) as a
tool for describing the microscopic dynamics. We show that is possible to
provide a parameterized version of the ME, in terms of a single numerical
parameter (alpha), such that the different expressions for the diffusive fluxes
are recovered at different values of alpha. This work aims to fill a gap in the
literature, where the ME was shown to deliver just one diffusive limit. In the
second part of the paper some numerical computer models are introduced, both to
support analytical considerations, and to extend the scope of the ME to more
sophisticated scenarios, beyond the simplest alpha-parameterization.

phenomena. The first is the energy dissipation and the second is the mechanical

dissipation is different, and it is determined by an effective viscosity which

superfluid turbulence the transfer of mechanical momentum to the wall is caused
by the presence of a quantum vortex tangle, giving rise to another effective
""momentum"" viscosity that we will denote as $\nu_\text{m}(T)$. The temperature
dependence of the second effective viscosity is markedly different from Vinen's
effective viscosity $\nu'(T)$. We show that the notion of vortex-tension force,
playing an important role in the theory of quantum turbulence, can be

\emph{interpretation form}. Two papers, the current paper, defining the concept
of a structure, and ``The {\ttfamily ERA} of {\ttfamily FOLE}:
Superstructure'', defining the concept of a sound logic, represent the

``Information Flow Framework''. Two papers, ``The {\ttfamily FOLE} Table'',

entity-relationship-attribute data model of Chen, the interpretation form
incorporates the relational data model of Codd. A fifth paper ``{\ttfamily

both walks are partially equivalent; in particular, it helps to understand the

offers outstanding accuracy. When analysing hundreds of sequences, QuickProbs 2
is significantly better than Clustal Omega, the previous leader for processing
numerous protein families. In the case of smaller sets, for which
consistency-based methods are the best performing, QuickProbs 2 is also
superior to the competitors. Due to computational scalability of selective
consistency and utilisation of massively parallel architectures, presented
algorithm is comparable to Clustal Omega in terms of execution time, and orders
of magnitude faster than full consistency approaches, like MSAProbs or PicXAA.
All these make QuickProbs 2 a useful tool for aligning families ranging from
few, to hundreds of proteins. QuickProbs 2 is available at

from such a release is highly structured in space and we therefore propose the
use of a thin-plate spline to capture the spatial structure and fit a Gaussian
process emulator to the coefficients of the resultant basis functions. We
compare and contrast four different techniques for emulating multivariate

outperform the principal component emulator. Further, the separable thin-plate
spline emulator, which accounts for the dependence between basis coefficients,
provides substantially more realistic quantification of uncertainty, and is
also computationally more tractable, allowing fast emulation. For high
resolution output data, it also offers substantial predictive and computational
advantages over the tensor-product Gaussian process emulator.

Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS). EaaS is the paradigm of not providing data sets
to participants and have them work on the data locally, but keeping the data
central and allowing access via Application Programming Interfaces (API),

of this white paper are to summarize and compare the current approaches and
consolidate the experiences of these approaches to outline the next steps of

low fractions. This is a size-regime of metal particles where the expected
effect on emission from independent emitters is vain non-radiative loss. But
the addition of such metal particles in low fractions induces a strong
evolution of the super-radiant modes of emission among quantum dots and aids
their survival of thermal fluctuations; exhibiting a phase transition. While an
increase of size of metal particles results in an increase in local thermal
fluctuations to revert to the behavior of apparently independent emitters. Our
theoretical evaluations of their possible collective modes of emission in the
presence of metal nanoparticles predict such experimental observations. Two
different types of self-assembled nanoscale structures containing quantum dots
were experimentally studied. This included the effect of the fractions and size
of metal particles on the collective modes of emission in each type of

emission energies) of dots to establish generality. First, quantum dots
collected in cylindrical cavities surrounded by randomly located gold particles
were experimentally studied in large ensembles using polymer templates. The

wavefunction-to- density map at hand, we are able to construct arbitrary
observables as functionals of the ground-state density. We analyze the
density-to-potential map as the distance between the fragments of a system
increases and the correlation in the system grows. We observe a feature that
gradually develops in the density-to-potential map as well as in the
density-to-wavefunction map. This feature is inherited by arbitrary expectation
values as functional of the ground-state density. We explicitly show the
excited-state energies, the excited-state densities, and the correlation
entropy as functionals of the ground-state density. All of them show this exact
feature that sharpens as the coupling of the fragments decreases and the
correlation grows. We denominate this feature as intra-system steepening. We
show that for fully decoupled subsystems the intra-system steepening transforms
into the well-known inter-system derivative discontinuity. An important
conclusion is that for e.g. charge transfer processes between localized

discontinuity that is missing in common ground-state functionals, but rather

model is based on the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem. For a single-slit
collimation the width of the collimating aperture controls the shape of the
azimuthal angle distribution, making different interference mechanisms visible,
while the length of the slit affects the polar angle distribution.
Additionally, we found that by means of a double-slit collimation it might be
possible to obtain a wide polar angle distribution, which is associated with a
large spread of the initial momentum perpendicular to the surface, derived from
the uncertainty principle. It might be used as a simple way to probe the
surface potential for different normal distances.

between a pair of phylogenetic trees that are reconstructed by different
methods or using different regions of genome. Motivated by the maximum
parsimony principle in tree inference, we recently introduced the maximum
parsimony (MP) distance, which enjoys various attractive properties due to its
connection with several other well-known tree distances, such as TBR and SPR.
Here we show that computing the MP distance between two trees, a NP-hard
problem in general, is fixed parameter tractable in terms of the TBR distance
between the tree pair. Our approach is based on two reduction rules--the chain
reduction and the subtree reduction--that are widely used in computing TBR and
SPR distances. More precisely, we show that reducing chains to length 4 (but
not shorter) preserves the MP distance. In addition, we describe a
generalization of the subtree reduction which allows the pendant subtrees to be
rooted in different places, and show that this still preserves the MP distance.
On a slightly different note we also show that Monadic Second Order Logic
(MSOL), posited over an auxiliary graph structure known as the display graph
(obtained by merging the two trees at their leaves), can be used to obtain an
alternative proof that computation of MP distance is fixed parameter tractable
in terms of TBR-distance. We conclude with an extended discussion in which we
focus on similarities and differences between MP distance and TBR distance and
present a number of open problems. One particularly intriguing question,
emerging from the MSOL formulation, is whether two trees with bounded MP
distance induce display graphs of bounded treewidth.

particle and their sharply varying spectra were elucidated as Fano resonances;
an 'interference' of two spatially orthogonal modes driving each other. On the
other hand, the scattering (and extinction) cross-section of a non-absorbing
dielectric particle is always the sum of the cross-sections of all mode
numbers; and this rules out any such Fano type interference between two
different mode numbers. So delectric particles exhibit an interference
structure in their extinction spectra only if it manifests in the individual
modes describing the scattered field of the particle. We show that in a
all-dielectric core-shell particle such strong interferences in multiple mode
numbers can be attained, and notably even as a spectral region of transparency
and directional scattering of incident light. Here interference between the
complementary normal modes of the nanoshell and core regions can be realized
for each mode number, resulting in a sharp interference structure in the
extinction of the particle. This manifests as spectral regions of
minimal/maximal interaction with the incident electromagnetic field. Such
spectral properties are significant for many applications where the
non-radiative losses of plasmonic structures are a liability. Note that this
behaviour is useful for optical antennas, cloaking materials and a quantum
mechanical interpretation of this classical effect may be signicant for
single-photon based applications.

explained with sub-TeV adjoint fermions and with perturbative Yukawa coupling.
A narrow width scenario is more preferred while a simultaneous explanation of
observed cross section and large total decay width requires some of the adjoint
fermions lighter than 375 GeV. The model also provides a singlet fermion as a
candidate of cold dark matter. The gauge coupling unification is achieved in
the framework by introducing color sextet scalars while being consistent with

the BS coordination to hand over the traffic offloaded from the inactive BSs to
the active BSs, it is generally NP-hard to find a network-level optimal
adaptation policy that can minimize the on-grid energy cost over a long-term

the network-level dynamic system design, we jointly apply stochastic geometry
(Geo) for large-scale green cellular network analysis and dynamic programming
(DP) for adaptive BS on/off operation design and on-grid energy purchase
design, and thus propose a new Geo-DP design approach. By this approach, we
obtain the optimal BS on/off policy, which shows that the optimal BSs' active
operation probability in each horizon is just sufficient to assure the required
downlink transmission quality with time-varying load in the large-scale
cellular network. We also propose a suboptimal on-grid energy purchase policy
with low-complexity, where the low-price on-grid energy is over-purchased in
the current horizon only when the current storage level and the future
renewable energy level are both low. We compare the proposed policy with the
existing schemes and show that our proposed policy can more efficiently save
the on-grid energy cost over time.

Depending on their sign, modifications make gravity repulsive above a curvature
scale for matter satisfying strong energy condition, or more attractive than in
the classical theory. Canonical structure of the modified theories is
determined demanding that the total Hamiltonian be a linear combination of
gravity and matter Hamiltonians. In the quadratic repulsive case, the modified
canonical phase space of gravity is a polymerized phase space with canonical
momentum as inverse trigonometric function of Hubble rate; the canonical
Hamiltonian can be identified with the effective Hamiltonian in loop quantum
cosmology. The repulsive cubic modification results in a `generalized
polymerized' canonical phase space. Both of the repulsive modifications are
found to yield singularity avoidance. In contrast, the quadratic and cubic
attractive modifications result in a canonical phase space in which canonical
momentum is non-trigonometric and singularities persist. Our results hint on
connections between repulsive/attractive nature of modifications to gravity

the Akulov-Volkov action of the goldstino by a superfield formulation with
$L=(\Phi^\dagger \Phi)_D + [(f\Phi)_F + h.c.]$ endowed with the nilpotent
constraint $\Phi^2=0$ for the goldstino superfield ($\Phi$). Inspired by this,
such constraint is often used to define the goldstino superfield even in the
presence of additional superfields, for example in models of ""nilpotent
inflation"". In this review we show that the nilpotent property is not valid in
general, under the assumption of a microscopic (ultraviolet) description of the
theory with linear supermultiplets. Sometimes only weaker versions of the
nilpotent relation are true such as $\Phi^3=0$ or $\Phi^4=0$ ($\Phi^2\not=0$)
in the infrared (far below the UV scale) under the further requirement of
decoupling all additional scalars (coupling to sgoldstino), something not
always possible (e.g. if light scalars exist). In such cases the weaker
nilpotent property is not specific to the goldstino superfield anymore. We
review the restrictions for the Kahler curvature tensor and superpotential $W$
under which $\Phi^2=0$ remains true in infrared, assuming linear
supermultiplets in the microscopic description. One can reverse the arguments
to demand that the nilpotent condition, initially an infrared property, be
extended even in the presence of additional superfields, but this may question
the nature of supersymmetry breaking or the existence of a perturbative
ultraviolet completion with linear supermultiplets.

intermediate temperatures the experimentally accessible contact is a
non-monotonic function of the coupling strength. As a function of the

Tonks-Girardeau regime which signals an abrupt change of the momentum

outputs a value of $R$ ln(2) at $T_{N2}$ suggesting a doublet state for

graphs is a major challenge in Pattern Recognition. The Graph Edit Distance
(GED) is a flexible measure of dissimilarity between graphs which arises in
error-tolerant graph matching. It is defined from an optimal sequence of edit
operations (edit path) transforming one graph into an other. Unfortunately, the
exact computation of this measure is NP-hard. In the last decade, several
approaches have been proposed to approximate the GED in polynomial time, mainly
by solving linear programming problems. Among them, the bipartite GED has
received much attention. It is deduced from a linear sum assignment of the
nodes of the two graphs, which can be efficiently computed by Hungarian-type
algorithms. However, edit operations on nodes and edges are not handled
simultaneously, which limits the accuracy of the approximation. To overcome
this limitation, we propose to extend the linear assignment model to a
quadratic one, for directed or undirected graphs having labelized nodes and
edges. This is realized through the definition of a family of edit paths
induced by assignments between nodes. We formally show that the GED, restricted
to the paths in this family, is equivalent to a quadratic assignment problem.
Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose to compute an approximate solution by
an adaptation of the Integer Projected Fixed Point method. Experiments show
that the proposed approach is generally able to reach a more accurate
approximation of the optimal GED than the bipartite GED, with a computational
cost that is still affordable for graphs of non trivial sizes.

near-integrable deformations is used to study evolution equations resulting
from vertical-averages of the Euler system for two-layer stratified flows in an
infinite 2D channel. The Hamiltonian structure of the averaged equations is
obtained directly from that of the Euler equations through the process of
Hamiltonian reduction. Long-wave asymptotics together with the Boussinesq
approximation of neglecting the fluids' inertia is then applied to reduce the
leading order vertically averaged equations to the shallow-water Airy system,
and thence, in a non-trivial way, to the dispersionless non-linear
Schr\""odinger equation. The full non-Boussinesq system for the dispersionless
limit can then be viewed as a deformation of this well known equation. In a
perturbative study of this deformation, it is shown that at first order the
deformed system possesses an infinite sequence of constants of the motion, thus
casting this system within the framework of completely integrable equations.
The Riemann invariants of the deformed model are then constructed, and some
local solutions found by hodograph-like formulae for completely integrable
systems are obtained.

Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. In this article we study the
experiment's expected sensitivity to the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon
interaction cross section, based on Monte Carlo predictions of the electronic
and nuclear recoil backgrounds.
  The total electronic recoil background in $1$ tonne fiducial volume and ($1$,
$12$) keV electronic recoil equivalent energy region, before applying any
selection to discriminate between electronic and nuclear recoils, is $(1.80 \pm
0.15) \cdot 10^{-4}$ ($\rm{kg} \cdot day \cdot keV)^{-1}$, mainly due to the
decay of $^{222}\rm{Rn}$ daughters inside the xenon target. The nuclear recoil
background in the corresponding nuclear recoil equivalent energy region ($4$,
$50$) keV, is composed of $(0.6 \pm 0.1)$ ($\rm{t} \cdot y)^{-1}$ from
radiogenic neutrons, $(1.8 \pm 0.3) \cdot 10^{-2}$ ($\rm{t} \cdot y)^{-1}$ from
coherent scattering of neutrinos, and less than $0.01$ ($\rm{t} \cdot y)^{-1}$
from muon-induced neutrons.
  The sensitivity of XENON1T is calculated with the Profile Likelihood Ratio
method, after converting the deposited energy of electronic and nuclear recoils
into the scintillation and ionization signals seen in the detector. We take
into account the systematic uncertainties on the photon and electron emission
model, and on the estimation of the backgrounds, treated as nuisance
parameters. The main contribution comes from the relative scintillation
efficiency $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{eff}$, which affects both the signal from WIMPs
and the nuclear recoil backgrounds. After a $2$ y measurement in $1$ t fiducial
volume, the sensitivity reaches a minimum cross section of $1.6 \cdot 10^{-47}$
cm$^2$ at m$_\chi$=$50$ GeV/$c^2$.

become an important problem in many rapidly evolving technological areas such
as robotics and augmented reality. Single shot-based 6D pose estimators with
manually designed features are still unable to tackle the above challenges,
motivating the research towards unsupervised feature learning and
next-best-view estimation. In this work, we present a complete framework for
both single shot-based 6D object pose estimation and next-best-view prediction
based on Hough Forests, the state of the art object pose estimator that
performs classification and regression jointly. Rather than using manually
designed features we a) propose an unsupervised feature learnt from
depth-invariant patches using a Sparse Autoencoder and b) offer an extensive
evaluation of various state of the art features. Furthermore, taking advantage
of the clustering performed in the leaf nodes of Hough Forests, we learn to
estimate the reduction of uncertainty in other views, formulating the problem
of selecting the next-best-view. To further improve pose estimation, we propose
an improved joint registration and hypotheses verification module as a final
refinement step to reject false detections. We provide two additional
challenging datasets inspired from realistic scenarios to extensively evaluate
the state of the art and our framework. One is related to domestic environments
and the other depicts a bin-picking scenario mostly found in industrial
settings. We show that our framework significantly outperforms state of the art
both on public and on our datasets.

radio through X-rays. These variations sometimes appear in spontaneous
outbursts that are referred to as flares. Multi-frequency observations of Sgr
A* provide access to easily observable parameters that can test the currently
accepted models that try to explain these intensity outbursts. Methods. On May
16-18, 2012 Sgr A* has been observed with the VLBA at 7 mm (43 GHz) for 6 hours
each day during a global multi-wavelength campaign. These observations were
triggered by a NIR flare observed at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Accurate
flux densities and source morphologies were acquired. Results. The total 7 mm
flux of Sgr A* shows only minor variations during its quiescent states on a
daily basis of 0.06 Jy. An observed NIR flare on May 17 was followed 4.5 hours
later by an increase in flux density of 0.22 Jy at 43 GHz. This agrees well
with the expected time delay of events that are casually connected by adiabatic
expansion. Shortly before the peak of the radio flare, Sgr A* developed a
secondary radio off-core feature at 1.5 mas toward the southeast. Even though
the closure phases are too noisy to place actual constraints on this feature, a
component at this scale together with a time delay of 4.5 +- 0.5 hours between
the NIR and radio flare provide evidence for an adiabatically expanding jet
feature.

algorithm belonging to a broad class of oracle-based first-order methods for
composite convex optimization, including those performing explicit, projected,
proximal, conditional and inexact (sub)gradient steps. We simultaneously obtain
tight worst-case guarantees and explicit instances of optimization problems on
which the algorithm reaches this worst-case. We achieve this by reducing the
computation of the worst-case to solving a convex semidefinite program,
generalizing previous works on performance estimation by Drori and Teboulle
[13] and the authors [43]. We use these developments to obtain a tighter
analysis of the proximal point algorithm and of several variants of fast
proximal gradient, conditional gradient, subgradient and alternating projection
methods. In particular, we present a new analytical worst-case guarantee for
the proximal point algorithm that is twice better than previously known, and
improve the standard worst-case guarantee for the conditional gradient method
by more than a factor of two. We also show how the optimized gradient method
proposed by Kim and Fessler in [22] can be extended by incorporating a
projection or a proximal operator, which leads to an algorithm that converges
in the worst-case twice as fast as the standard accelerated proximal gradient
method [2].

fraction, 22500 - 56400 times the solar abundance). In addition, from the As V

systems with affine controls. The control task is to enforce the system state
to follow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible. The concept
of so-called exactly realizable trajectories is proposed. For exactly
realizable desired trajectories exists a control signal which enforces the
state to exactly follow the desired trajectory. For a given affine control
system, these trajectories are characterized by the so-called constraint
equation. This approach does not only yield an explicit expression for the
control signal in terms of the desired trajectory, but also identifies a
particularly simple class of nonlinear control systems. Based on that insight,
the regularization parameter is used as the small parameter for a perturbation
expansion. This results in a reinterpretation of affine optimal control
problems with small regularization term as singularly perturbed differential
equations. The small parameter originates from the formulation of the control
problem and does not involve simplifying assumptions about the system dynamics.
Combining this approach with the linearizing assumption, approximate and partly
linear equations for the optimal trajectory tracking of arbitrary desired
trajectories are derived. For vanishing regularization parameter, the state
trajectory becomes discontinuous and the control signal diverges. On the other
hand, the analytical treatment becomes exact and the solutions are exclusively
governed by linear differential equations. Thus, the possibility of linear
structures underlying nonlinear optimal control is revealed. This fact enables
the derivation of exact analytical solutions to an entire class of nonlinear
trajectory tracking problems with affine controls. This class comprises
mechanical control systems in one spatial dimension and the FitzHugh-Nagumo
model.
