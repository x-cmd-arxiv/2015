tunneling due to the overlap of the wavefunctions of both ribbons. We apply the
Bardeen transfer Hamiltonian formalism, using atomistic band structure
calculations to account for the effect of the atomic structure on the tunneling
process. The strong quantum-size confinement of the nanoribbons is mirrored by
the one-dimensional character of the electronic structure, resulting in
properties that differ significantly from the case of inter-layer tunneling,
where tunneling occurs between bulk two-dimensional graphene sheets. The
current-voltage characteristics of the inter-ribbon tunneling structures
exhibit resonance, as well as stepwise increases in current. Both features are
caused by the energetic alignment of one-dimensional peaks in the
density-of-states of the ribbons. Resonant tunneling occurs if the sign of the
curvature of the coupled energy bands is equal, whereas a step-like increase of
the current occurs if the signs are opposite. Changing the doping modulates the
onset- voltage of the effects as well as their magnitude. Doping through
electrostatic gating makes these structures promising for application towards
steep slope switching devices. Using the atomistic Bardeen transfer Hamiltonian
method, inter-ribbon tunneling can be studied for the whole range of
two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. The
effects of resonance and of step-like increases of the current, observed in
graphene ribbons, are also expected in ribbons made from these alternative
two-dimensional materials, because these effects are manifestations of the
one-dimensional character of the density-of-states.

simulations. The shapes refer to the components of dark matter (DM), stars and
gas at the stellar half-mass radius. Most galaxies undergo a characteristic
compaction event into a blue nugget at $z\sim2-4$, which marks the transition
from a DM-dominated central body to a self-gravitating baryonic core. We find
that in the high-$z$, DM-dominated phase, the stellar and DM systems tend to be
triaxial, preferentially prolate and mutually aligned. The elongation is
supported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion that originates from the
assembly of the galaxy along a dominant large-scale filament. We estimate that
torques by the dominant halo are capable of inducing the elongation of the
stellar system and its alignment with the halo. Then, in association with the
transition to self-gravity, small-pericenter orbits puff up and the DM and
stellar systems evolve into a more spherical and oblate configuration, aligned
with the gas disc and associated with rotation. This transition typically
occurs when the stellar mass is $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and the escape velocity
in the core is $\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that supernova feedback may
be effective in keeping the core DM-dominated and the system prolate. The early
elongated phase itself may be responsible for the compaction event, and the
transition to the oblate phase may be associated with the subsequent quenching
in the core.

find that the hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are strongly (two orders of

moments to gradients of electric fields leads to clock frequency uncertainties.

for the spectral simulations of the water waves is introduced. Signals with
majority of the components zero, are known as the sparse signals. Like majority
of the signals in the nature it can be realized that water waves are sparse
either in time or in the frequency domain. Using the sparsity property of the
water waves in the time or in the frequency domain, the compressive sampling
algorithm can be used as a tool for improving the performance of the spectral
simulation of the water waves. The methodology offered in this paper depends on
the idea of using a smaller number of spectral components compared to the
classical spectral method with a high number of components. After performing
the time integration with a smaller number of spectral components and using the
compressive sampling technique, it is shown that the water wave field can be
reconstructed with a significantly better efficiency compared to the classical
spectral method with a high number of spectral components, especially for long
time evolutions.

wave solutions of the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation is considered. For the
sparse water wave model in the frequency domain the well-known Airy (linear)
ocean waves with Jonswap spectrum is considered. Utilizing a spectral method,
it is shown that by using a smaller number of spectral components compared to
the classical spectral method with a high number of components, it is possible
to simulate the sparse water waves with negligible error in accuracy and a
great efficiency especially for large time evolutions.

artificial noise-beamforming and noise-alignment techniques at the relays in

numerous practical machine learning tasks such as classification of images in
the ImageNet data set, control-policy-learning to play Atari games or the board
game Go, and image captioning. Many of these applications first perform feature
extraction and then feed the results thereof into a trainable classifier. The
mathematical analysis of deep convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction was initiated by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered
so-called scattering networks based on a wavelet transform followed by the
modulus non-linearity in each network layer, and proved translation invariance
(asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter) and deformation stability of
the corresponding feature extractor. This paper complements Mallat's results by
developing a theory that encompasses general convolutional transforms, or in
more technical parlance, general semi-discrete frames (including
Weyl-Heisenberg filters, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets, wavelets, and learned
filters), general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities (e.g., rectified linear
units, shifted logistic sigmoids, hyperbolic tangents, and modulus functions),
and general Lipschitz-continuous pooling operators emulating, e.g.,
sub-sampling and averaging. In addition, all of these elements can be different
in different network layers. For the resulting feature extractor we prove a
translation invariance result of vertical nature in the sense of the features
becoming progressively more translation-invariant with increasing network
depth, and we establish deformation sensitivity bounds that apply to signal
classes such as, e.g., band-limited functions, cartoon functions, and Lipschitz
functions.

(DBD), axion research and low-mass WIMP searches. While in the companion paper
we focus on DBD, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the search for
dark matter candidates, both axions and WIMPs. Small ultra-low background
Micromegas detectors are used to image the x-ray signal expected in axion
helioscopes like CAST at CERN. Background levels as low as $0.8\times 10^{-6}$
c keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have already been achieved in CAST while values
down to $\sim10^{-7}$ c keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have been obtained in a
test bench placed underground in the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc.
Prospects to consolidate and further reduce these values down to $\sim10^{-8}$
c keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$will be described. Such detectors, placed at the
focal point of x-ray telescopes in the future IAXO experiment, would allow for
10$^5$ better signal-to-noise ratio than CAST, and search for solar axions with
$g_{a\gamma}$ down to few 10$^{12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, well into unexplored axion
parameter space. In addition, a scaled-up version of these TPCs, properly
shielded and placed underground, can be competitive in the search for low-mass
WIMPs. The TREX-DM prototype, with $\sim$0.300 kg of Ar at 10 bar, or
alternatively $\sim$0.160 kg of Ne at 10 bar, and energy threshold well below 1

$\sim10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ for low mass ($<10$ GeV) WIMPs, well beyond current

problem of modern mathematical finance. One of the ways to model illiquidity
among others is to build an optimization problem and assume that one of the
assets in a portfolio can not be sold until a certain finite, infinite or
random moment of time. This approach arises a certain amount of models that are
actively studied at the moment.
  Working in the Merton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we
consider an optimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and
a risk-free asset. Our goal in this paper is to carry out a complete Lie group
analysis of PDEs describing value function and investment and consumption
strategies for a portfolio with an illiquid asset that is sold in an exogenous
random moment of time with a prescribed liquidation time distribution. The
problem of such type leads to three dimensional nonlinear
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Such equations are not only tedious
for analytical methods but are also quite challenging form a numeric point of
view. To reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one or even
to an ODE one usually uses some substitutions, yet the methods used to find
such substitutions are rarely discussed by the authors.
  We find the admitted Lie algebra for a broad class of liquidation time
distributions in cases of HARA and log utility functions and formulate
corresponding theorems for all these cases. We use found Lie algebras to obtain
reductions of the studied equations. Several of similar substitutions were used
in other papers before whereas others are new to our knowledge. This method
gives us the possibility to provide a complete set of non-equivalent
substitutions and reduced equations.

changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen
populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype
frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical
viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen
binding affinities. We also identify definitive signatures of coevolution that
measure the reciprocal response between antibodies and viruses, and we
introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of
adaptation during continual coevolution of the two opposing populations. Using
this analytical framework, we infer rates of viral and immune adaptation based
on time-shifted neutralization assays in two HIV-infected patients. Finally, we
analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the
fate of a given lineage in terms of the state of the antibody and viral
populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence
of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may be useful in designing a vaccine
against HIV.

propose a coding technique with truncated memory to ensure that a summation of
constants, which arises as a result of applications of the central limit
theorem, does not diverge in the error analysis.
  Furthermore, we explore interesting variants of the basic streaming setup in
the moderate deviations regime. We first consider a scenario with an erasure
option at the decoder and show that both the exponents of the total error and
the undetected error probabilities improve by factors of $T$. Next, by
utilizing the erasure option, we show that the exponent of the total error

between them based on a variety of parameters. However, repeated resurgence of
Ebola contagions suggests that there are components of the global disease
dynamics that we don't yet fully understand and can't effectively control.
  In order to understand the dynamics of a more widespread contagion, we placed
SIR models within the framework of dynamic networks, with the communities at
risk of contracting the virus acting as nonlinear systems, coupled based on a
connectivity graph. We study how the effects of the disease (measured as the
outbreak impact and duration) change with respect to local parameters, but also
with changes in both short-range and long-range connectivity patterns in the
graph. We discuss the implications of optimizing both these measures in
increasingly realistic models of coupled communities.

diversity in ecology, as well as in genetics, economics and other fields. There
is a spectrum of viewpoints on diversity, indexed by a real parameter q giving
greater or lesser importance to rare species. Leinster and Cobbold proposed a
one-parameter family of diversity measures taking into account both this
variation and the varying similarities between species. Because of this latter
feature, diversity is not maximized by the uniform distribution on species. So
it is natural to ask: which distributions maximize diversity, and what is its
maximum value?
  In principle, both answers depend on q, but our main theorem is that neither
does. Thus, there is a single distribution that maximizes diversity from all
viewpoints simultaneously, and any list of species has an unambiguous maximum
diversity value. Furthermore, the maximizing distribution(s) can be computed in
finite time, and any distribution maximizing diversity from some particular
viewpoint q > 0 actually maximizes diversity for all q.
  Although we phrase our results in ecological terms, they apply very widely,
with applications in graph theory and metric geometry.

Stueckelberg theory. We provide two alternative but equivalent expressions for
this result. The first one is obtained by removing the contribution of the
""Stueckelberg ghost"" $\Phi$ and only involves state-dependent and geometrical
quantities associated with the massive vector field $A_\mu$. The other one
involves contributions coming from both the massive vector field and the
auxiliary Stueckelberg scalar field, and it has been constructed in such a way
that, in the zero-mass limit, the massive vector field contribution reduces
smoothly to the result obtained from Maxwell's theory. As an application of our
results, we consider the Casimir effect outside a perfectly conducting medium
with a plane boundary. We discuss the results obtained using Stueckelberg but
also de Broglie-Proca electromagnetism and we consider the zero-mass limit of
the vacuum energy in both theories. We finally compare the de Broglie-Proca and
Stueckelberg formalisms and highlight the advantages of the Stueckelberg point
of view, even if, in our opinion, the de Broglie-Proca and Stueckelberg
approaches of massive electromagnetism are two faces of the same field theory.

  Integrable turbulence, that develops from MI of dn-branch of cnoidal waves,
asymptotically approaches to it's stationary state in oscillatory way. During
this process kinetic and potential energies oscillate around their asymptotic
values. The amplitudes of these oscillations decay with time as t^{-a},
1<a<1.5, the phases contain nonlinear phase shift decaying as t^{-1/2}, and the
frequency of the oscillations is equal to the double maximal growth rate of the

kinetic energy is equal to -2. The asymptotic PDF of wave amplitudes is close
to Rayleigh distribution for cnoidal waves with strong overlapping, and is
significantly non-Rayleigh one for cnoidal waves with weak overlapping of
solitons. In the latter case the dynamics of the system reduces to two-soliton

re-scaled Mukhanov-Sasaki variable is conserved leading to a constraint
equation for the Newtonian potential. However, conversely to the minimal case,
in Horndeski theories, the super-horizon Newtonian potential can potentially
grow to very large values after inflation exit. If that happens, inflationary
predictability is lost during the oscillating period. When this does not
happen, the perturbations generated during inflation can be standardly related
to the CMB, if the theory chosen is minimal at low energies. As a concrete
example, we analytically and numerically discuss the new Higgs inflationary
case. There, the Inflaton is the Higgs boson that is non-minimally kinetically
coupled to gravity. During the high-energy part of the post-inflationary
oscillations, the system is anisotropic and the Newtonian potential is largely
amplified. Thanks to the smallness of today's amplitude of curvature
perturbations, however, the system stays in the linear regime, so that
inflationary predictions are not lost. At low energies, when the system relaxes
to the minimal case, the anisotropies disappear and the Newtonian potential
converges to a constant value. We show that the constant value to which the
Newtonian potential converges is related to the frozen part of curvature
perturbations during inflation, precisely like in the minimal case.

follow the $\varepsilon_n\propto \sqrt{nB}$ characteristic of Dirac crystals as
graphene. By using the Kubo-Bastin formula in the context of the kernel

narrow Gaussian components were identified as cold HI. In the second method,
the brightness temperature (T_B) is used as a tracer of cold HI. We find that
the amount of cold gas identified using the T_B method is significantly larger

space $\mathbb{R}^d$ or on subsets consisting of a cube $\Lambda_L$ of integer
length $L$. For eigenfunctions of the operator, and more general solutions of
elliptic differential quations, we derive several quantitative unique
continuation results. The first result is of local nature and estimates the
vanishing order of a solution. The second is a sampling result and compares the
$L^2$-norm of a solution over a union of equidistributed $\delta$-balls in
space with the $L^2$-norm on the entire space. In the case where the space
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is replaced by a finite cube $\Lambda_L$ we derive similar
estimates. A particular feature of our bound is that they are uniform as long
as the coefficients of the operator are chosen from an appropriate ensemble,
they are quantitative and explicit with respect to the radius $\delta$, they
are $L$-independent and stable under small shifts of the $\delta$-balls. Our
proof applies to second order terms which have slowly varying coefficients on
the relevant length scale. The results can be also interpreted as special cases
of uncertainty relations, observability estimates, or spectral inequalities.

Shannon entropy in independent and regular cubic voxels of increasing grid
sizes. We also analyze the data by carrying out measurements in overlapping
spheres and find that it suppresses inhomogeneities by a factor of 5 to 10 on
different length scales. Despite the differences observed in the degree of
inhomogeneity both the methods show a decrease in inhomogeneity with increasing
length scales which eventually settle down to a plateau at $\sim 150 \, h^{-1}

and their expected variations we conclude that the LRG distribution becomes
homogeneous at $150 \, h^{-1} \rm {Mpc}$ and beyond. We also use the
Kullback-Leibler divergence as an alternative measure of inhomogeneity which
reaffirms our findings. We show that the method presented here can effectively
capture the inhomogeneity in a truly inhomogeneous distribution at all length
scales. We analyze a set of Monte Carlo simulations with certain periodicity in
their spatial distributions and find periodic variations in their inhomogeneity
which helps us to identify the underlying regularities present in such
distributions and quantify the scale of their periodicity. We do not find any
underlying regularities in the LRG distribution within the length scales

codes and subspace codes. The main result of this paper is that vector
solutions can significantly reduce the required alphabet size compared to the
optimal scalar linear solution for the same multicast network. The multicast
networks considered in this paper have one source with $h$ messages, and the
vector solution is over a field of size $q$ with vectors of length~$t$. For a
given network, let the smallest field size for which the network has a scalar
linear solution be $q_s$, then the gap in the alphabet size between the vector
solution and the scalar linear solution is defined to be $q_s-q^t$. In this
contribution, the achieved gap is $q^{(h-2)t^2/h + o(t)}$ for any $q \geq 2$
and any even $h \geq 4$. If $h \geq 5$ is odd, then the achieved gap of the
alphabet size is $q^{(h-3)t^2/(h-1) + o(t)}$. Previously, only a gap of size
size one had been shown for networks with a very large number of messages.
These results imply the same gap of the alphabet size between the optimal
scalar linear and some scalar nonlinear network coding solution for multicast
networks. For three messages, we also show an advantage of vector network
coding, while for two messages the problem remains open. Several networks are
considered, all of them are generalizations and modifications of the well-known
combination networks. The vector network codes that are used as solutions for
those networks are based on subspace codes, particularly subspace codes
obtained from rank-metric codes. Some of these codes form a new family of
subspace codes, which poses a new research problem.

  Problem",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the airplane refueling problem which was introduced by the
physicists Gamow and Stern in their classical book Puzzle-Math (1958). Sticking
to the original story behind this problem, suppose we have to deliver a bomb in
some distant point of the globe, the distance being much greater than the range
of any individual airplane at our disposal. Therefore, the only feasible option
to carry out this mission is to better utilize our fleet via mid-air refueling.
Starting with several airplanes that can refuel one another, and gradually drop
out of the flight until the single plane carrying the bomb reaches the target,
how would you plan the refueling policy?
  The main contribution of Gamow and Stern was to provide a complete
characterization of the optimal refueling policy for the special case of
identical airplanes. In spite of their elegant and easy-to-analyze solution,
the computational complexity of the general airplane refueling problem, with
arbitrary tank volumes and consumption rates, has remained widely open ever
since, as recently pointed out by Woeginger (Open Problems in Scheduling,
Dagstuhl 2010, page 24). To our knowledge, other than a logarithmic
approximation, which can be attributed to folklore, it is not entirely obvious
even if constant-factor performance guarantees are within reach.
  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the
airplane refueling problem in its utmost generality. Our approach builds on a
novel combination of ideas related to parametric pruning, efficient guessing
tricks, reductions to well-structured instances of generalized assignment, and
additional insight into how LP-rounding algorithms in this context actually
work. We complement this result by presenting a fast and easy-to-implement
algorithm that approximates the optimal refueling policy to within a constant
factor.

example with respect to arranging objects on different shelves. As many of
these preferences depend on a variety of factors including personal taste,
cultural background, or common sense, it is challenging for an expert to
pre-program a robot in order to accommodate all potential users. At the same
time, it is impractical for robots to constantly query users about how they
should perform individual tasks. In this work, we present an approach to learn
patterns in user preferences for the task of tidying up objects in containers,
e.g., shelves or boxes. Our method builds upon the paradigm of collaborative
filtering for making personalized recommendations and relies on data from
different users that we gather using crowdsourcing. To deal with novel objects
for which we have no data, we propose a method that compliments standard
collaborative filtering by leveraging information mined from the Web. When
solving a tidy-up task, we first predict pairwise object preferences of the
user. Then, we subdivide the objects in containers by modeling a spectral
clustering problem. Our solution is easy to update, does not require complex
modeling, and improves with the amount of user data. We evaluate our approach
using crowdsourcing data from over 1,200 users and demonstrate its
effectiveness for two tidy-up scenarios. Additionally, we show that a real

that in finite systems of length $L$, the spin density for one pairing branch

spin density profile carrying fractional quantum number $\varphi/(2\pi)$, and a
uniform background $-\varphi /(2\pi L)$. The latter one vanishes in the
thermodynamic limit leaving a single soliton mode carrying fractional

Borel. When it is non Borel, there is always the hope it will be Borel on a
""large"" set -- nonmeager or of positive measure. That has led Kanovei, Sabok
and Zapletal to ask whether every proper $\sigma$ ideal satisfies the following
property: given $E$ an analytic equivalence relation with Borel classes, there
exists a set $B$ which is Borel and $I$-positive such that $E\restriction_{B}$
is Borel. We propose a related problem -- does every proper $\sigma$ ideal
satisfy: given $A$ an analytic subset of the plane with Borel sections, there
exists a set $B$ which is Borel and $I$-positive such that
$A\cap(B\times\omega^{\omega})$ is Borel. We answer positively when a
measurable cardinal exists, and negatively in $L$, where no proper $\sigma$
ideal has that property. Assuming $\omega_{1}$ is inaccessible to the reals but
not Mahlo in $L$, we construct a ccc $\sigma$ ideal $I$ not having this
property -- in fact, forcing with $I$ adds a non Borel section to a certain
analytic set with Borel sections, and a non Borel class to a certain analytic
equivalence relation with Borel classes. Various counterexamples are given for
the case of a $\mathbf{\Delta_{2}^{1}}$ equivalence relation as well as for the
case of an improper ideal.

sequence of $k+1$ vertices $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_{k+1}$ such that $i_1,

supremum of $\liminf_{ n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{ e(G_n) }{n^2}$ over all
$I_k$-free graphs $G$. In 1962, Czipszer, Erd\H{o}s, and Hajnal proved that
$p(k) = \frac{1}{4} (1 - \frac{1}{k})$ for $k \in \{2,3 \}$. Erd\H{o}s
conjectured that this holds for all $ k \geq 4$. This was disproved for certain

Given that the conjecture of Erd\H{o}s is true for $k \in \{2,3 \}$ but false
for large $k$, it is natural to ask for the smallest value of $k$ for which
$p(k) > \frac{1}{4} ( 1 - \frac{1}{k} )$. In particular, the question of
whether or not $p(4) = \frac{1}{4} ( 1 - \frac{1}{4} )$ was mentioned by Dudek

\geq \frac{1}{4} (1 - \frac{1}{4} ) + \frac{1}{584064}$ and $p(k) > \frac{1}{4}
(1 - \frac{1}{k})$ for $4 \leq k \leq 15$. We also show that $p(4) \leq
\frac{1}{4}$ which improves upon the previously best known upper bound on
$p(4)$. Therefore, $p(4)$ must lie somewhere between $\frac{3}{16} +
\frac{1}{584064}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$

only non-local terms which depend just on the Ricci scalar $R$ appear to be
cosmologically viable. We discuss how these results can provide a hint for the

signal strength. We check the compatibility of our hypothesis with other
searches for the KK graviton. We show that the invisible decay rate of the

correct relic density, hence leading to no constraints from the mono-jet bound

able to compare simultaneous observations of the \xxi~1354.08~\AA~and
\xxiii~263.77~\AA~high temperature emission ($\gtrsim$ 10~MK) in the flare
ribbon during the chromospheric evaporation phase. We find that IRIS observes
completely blue-shifted \xxi~line profiles, up to 200 km s$^{-1}$ during the
rise phase of the flare, indicating that the site of the plasma upflows is
resolved by IRIS. In contrast, the \xxiii~line is often asymmetric, which we
interpret as being due to the lower spatial resolution of EIS. Temperature
estimates from SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT show that hot emission (log($T$)[K] $>$
7.2) is first concentrated at the footpoints before filling the loops. Density
sensitive lines from IRIS and EIS give electron number density estimates of
$\gtrsim$~10$^{12}$~cm$^{-3}$ in the transition region lines and
10$^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$ in the coronal lines during the impulsive phase. In order
to compare the observational results against theoretical predictions, we have
run a simulation of a flare loop undergoing heating using the HYDRAD 1D hydro

ever-growing traffic demand in next generation wireless networks. To utilize
this band, it is crucial to obtain the channel state information in order to
perform beamforming and combining to compensate for severe path loss. In
contrast to lower frequencies, a typical millimeter wave channel consists of a
few dominant paths. Thus it is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains,
angles of departure (AoDs), and angles of arrival (AoAs) of those paths.
Proposed in this paper is a dual timescale model to characterize abrupt channel
changes (e.g., blockage) and slow variations of AoDs and AoAs. This work
focuses on tracking the slow variations and detecting abrupt changes. A Kalman
filter based tracking algorithm and an abrupt change detection method are
proposed. The tracking algorithm is compared with the adaptive algorithm due to
Alkhateeb, Ayach, Leus and Heath (2014) in the case with single radio frequency
chain. Simulation results show that to achieve the same tracking performance,
the proposed algorithm requires much lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and much
fewer pilots than the other algorithm. Moreover, the change detection method
can always detect abrupt changes with moderate number of pilots and SNR.

systems - simple analytic formulas show that three revival sequences produce a
three-frequency beat note in the time evolution of the population. We find an
explicit way to estimate the dynamics for the qubit-field and qubit-qubit
entanglement inside the three-qubit system in the ultra strong coupling regime,
and the resistance to the sudden death proves the robustness of the GHZ state.

  Theory and their Consequences",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Private regression has received attention from both database and security
communities. Recent work by Fredrikson et al. (USENIX Security 2014) analyzed
the functional mechanism (Zhang et al. VLDB 2012) for training linear
regression models over medical data. Unfortunately, they found that model
accuracy is already unacceptable with differential privacy when $\varepsilon =
5$. We address this issue, presenting an explicit connection between
differential privacy and stable learning theory through which a substantially
better privacy/utility tradeoff can be obtained. Perhaps more importantly, our
theory reveals that the most basic mechanism in differential privacy, output
perturbation, can be used to obtain a better tradeoff for all
convex-Lipschitz-bounded learning tasks. Since output perturbation is simple to
implement, it means that our approach is potentially widely applicable in
practice. We go on to apply it on the same medical data as used by Fredrikson
et al. Encouragingly, we achieve accurate models even for $\varepsilon = 0.1$.
In the last part of this paper, we study the impact of our improved
differentially private mechanisms on model inversion attacks, a privacy attack
introduced by Fredrikson et al. We observe that the improved tradeoff makes the
resulting differentially private model more susceptible to inversion attacks.
We analyze this phenomenon formally.

techniques, such as are used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not
applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is
necessary to obtain all of the data prior to building the tree then to build
the tree via recursive subdivision of the data. One algorithm for building a
balanced k-d tree finds the median of the data for each recursive subdivision
of the data and builds the tree in O(n log n) time. A new algorithm builds a
balanced k-d tree by presorting the data in each of k dimensions prior to
building the tree, then preserves the order of the k presorts during recursive
subdivision of the data and builds the tree in O(kn log n) time. This new
algorithm is amenable to execution via MapReduce and permits building and
searching a k-d tree that is represented as a distributed graph.

over the meaning of the wave function of the universe. As it is demonstrated in
the paper, unless the number of the universe's degrees of freedom is
fundamentally upper bounded (owing to some unknown physical laws) or
hypercomputation is physically realizable, the universal wave function is a
non-constructive entity in the sense of constructive recursive mathematics.
This means that even if such a function might exist, basic mathematical
operations on it would be undefinable and subsequently the only content one
would be able to deduce from this function would be pure symbolical.

Rev. Lett. 115, 143001 (2015)] provides an easy-to-use recipe to obtain
conserving approximations within the self-consistent nonequilibrium many-body

calculating the phonon-limited electronic current in a model of a
single-molecule junction within the self-consistent Born approximation for the
electron-phonon interacting system, where the perturbation expansion for the
nonequilibrium Green function in powers of the free bosonic propagator
typically consists of a series of non-crossing \sunset"" diagrams.
Hypergeometric resummation preserves conservation laws and it is shown to
provide substantial convergence acceleration relative to more standard
approaches to self-consistency. This result strongly suggests that the
convergence of the self-consistent \sunset"" series is limited by a branch-cut
singularity, which is accurately described by Gauss hypergeometric functions.
Our results showcase an alternative approach to conservation laws and
self-consistency where expectation values obtained from conserving perturbation
expansions are \summed"" to their self-consistent value by analytic continuation
functions able to mimic the convergence-limiting singularity structure.

associated technologies built on the World Wide Web has grown exponentially
with access to Internet as a facility occupying a prime place with other
amenities of modern lives. In years to come, usage of Internet may unravel more
pleasant surprises for us as far as novelty in its usage is concerned. As a
democratic function of Internet, and relying on the open model on which it has
been built, there has been concerted efforts in the direction of privacy
protection and use of privacy enhancing tools which have gained tangible
traction. Innovation in use of VPN, TLS/SSL and cryptographic tools are a
testimony to it. Another popular tool is Tor, which has gained widespread
popularity as it is being increasingly used by anonymity seeking users to
effectively maintain their discretion while surfing the web.
  However, there is a darker side to increased proliferation of Internet in our
everyday routine. We are certainly not living in a utopian age and there are
potentials of misuse of Internet as well. Across every nook and cranny of
Internet's sprawling virtual world, there are cyber criminals lurking n
dangerous alleys to use the very same Internet as malevolent tool to abuse it
and cause financial, physical and social harm to ordinary people. Failing to
manage the widespread spawning of World Wide Web has rendered it weak against
misuse. In last few decades especially, Internet has been inundated with
malware, ransomware, viruses, Trojans, illegal spy tools and what not created
with malignant sentiments. In this paper, we will analyze few of the subverting
privacy infrastructures.

  We introduce a 3-dimensional extension of this model in which we regard A as
