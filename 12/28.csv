Survey (CHIMPS) which has been carried out using the Heterodyne Array Receiver
Program on the 15 m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii. The
high-resolution spectral survey currently covers |b| < 0.5 deg and 28 < l < 46
deg, with an angular resolution of 15 arcsec in 0.5 km/s velocity channels. The
spectra have a median rms of $\sim$ 0.6 K at this resolution, and for optically
thin gas at an excitation temperature of 10 K, this sensitivity corresponds to
column densities of $N_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \sim 3 \times 10^{20}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and
$N_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \sim 4 \times 10^{21}\,$cm$^{-2}$ for $^{13}$CO and
C$^{18}$O, respectively. The molecular gas that CHIMPS traces is at higher
column densities and is also more optically thin than in other publicly
available CO surveys due to its rarer isotopologues, and thus more
representative of the three-dimensional structure of the clouds. The critical
density of the J=3-2 transition of CO is $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ at
temperatures of $\leq 20$ K, and so the higher density gas associated with star
formation is well traced. These data complement other existing Galactic plane
surveys, especially the JCMT Galactic Plane Survey which has similar spatial
resolution and column density sensitivity, and the Herschel infrared Galactic
Plane Survey. In this paper, we discuss the observations, data reduction and
characteristics of the survey, presenting integrated emission maps for the
region covered. Position-velocity diagrams allow comparison with Galactic
structure models of the Milky Way, and while we find good agreement with a
particular four arm model, there are some significant deviations.

investigated with different spatial and temporal boundary conditions on
lattices of various spatial and temporal extensions, for two values of the bare
fermion mass representing a {\em heavy} and {\em light} fermion regime. Our
study shows that the infinite volume limit of masses and decay constants in the
mesonic sector is reached only when the mass of the pseudoscalar particle
$M_\mathrm{PS}$ and the spatial lattice size $L$ satisfy the relation $L
M_\mathrm{PS} \ge 15$. This bound, which is at least a factor of three higher
than what observed in QCD, is a likely consequence of the different spectral
signatures of the two theories, with the scalar isosinglet ($0^{++}$ glueball)
being the lightest particle in our model. In addition to stressing the
importance of simulating large lattice sizes, our analysis emphasises the need
to understand quantitatively the {\em full} spectrum of the theory rather than
just the spectrum in the mesonic isotriplet sector. While for the lightest
fermion measuring masses from gluonic operators proves to be still challenging,
reliable results for glueball states are obtained at the largest fermion mass
and, in the mesonic sector, for both fermion masses. As a byproduct of our
investigation, we perform a finite size scaling of the pseudoscalar mass and
decay constant. The data presented in this work support the conformal behaviour
of this theory with an anomalous dimension $\gamma_* \simeq 0.37$.

the classical and the quantum level. Recently, a local force density balance
was established for the 1s electron in the H atom, based on the energy-momentum
tensor of the classical Dirac field. This methodology is now extended to
quantum fields by considering the force densities acting on the vacuum
polarization induced by a point charge. Such a model is applicable to any
charged particle at large distances, since the only vestige of its internal
structure is the electric Coulomb field together with the vacuum polarization
induced by it. While the polarization charge density is attracted to the point
charge, it is kept from collapsing by repulsive forces due to confinement and
degeneracy. It is shown analytically that the corresponding force densities are
balanced for every filled shell of mj states at a given angular momentum j. The
force densities are then summed over all single-electron states in the Dirac
sea and renormalized by subtracting singular terms. In leading order of alpha,
the force densities remain balanced. This result establishes a local force
balance for a prototypical manybody system.

For equilibrium initial conditions, the work distributions for a given protocol
of variation of the force in time and the corresponding time-reversed protocol
exhibit a remarkable scaling and a symmetry when expressed in terms of the
average and the standard deviation of the work. The distributions of the work
per particle predict, by virtue of the Crooks fluctuation theorem, the

the orientation along which this particle has this spin value?"" It turns out
that the orientation is similarly subject to nonlocal effects. To enable the
reversal, each particle's interaction with a beam-splitter at t1 leaves its
spin orientation superposed. Then at t2, the experimenter selects an ""up"" or
""down"" spin value for this yet-undefined orientation. Only after the two

Additionally, we reconfigure resonance frequency of split ring resonators
without changing its amplitude by damping one of the two coupled metasurfaces

  - A Testbed and Experimental Results Using Advection-Diffusion Simulations","40 pages, 19 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causal discovery algorithms based on probabilistic graphical models have
emerged in geoscience applications for the identification and visualization of
dynamical processes. The key idea is to learn the structure of a graphical
model from observed spatio-temporal data, which indicates information flow,
thus pathways of interactions, in the observed physical system. Studying those
pathways allows geoscientists to learn subtle details about the underlying
dynamical mechanisms governing our planet. Initial studies using this approach
on real-world atmospheric data have shown great potential for scientific
discovery. However, in these initial studies no ground truth was available, so
that the resulting graphs have been evaluated only by whether a domain expert
thinks they seemed physically plausible. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We
develop a testbed that emulates two dynamical processes dominant in many
geoscience applications, namely advection and diffusion, in a 2D grid. Then we
apply the causal discovery based information tracking algorithms to the
simulation data to study how well the algorithms work for different scenarios
and to gain a better understanding of the physical meaning of the graph
results, in particular of instantaneous connections. We make all data sets used
in this study available to the community as a benchmark.

frequency matches the frequency of the spin-over inertial mode. Furthermore, we
extend our model by introducing a reduced model of the effect of viscous Ekman
layers in the limit of low Ekman number (Noir and C\'ebron 2013). This
theoretical approach is consistent with the results of Chan et al. (2011) and

against systematic three-dimensional numerical simulations. In the second part

1991; Gledzer and Ponomarev 1977) that allow to deduce upper and lower bounds
for the growth rate of an instability. Our analysis shows that the uniform
vorticity base flow is prone to inertial instabilities caused by a parametric
resonance mechanism. This is confirmed by a set of direct numerical
simulations. Applying our results to planetary settings, we find that neither a
spin-over resonance nor an inertial instability can exist within the liquid

nanotubes was investigated in the present work. Used the model of harmonic
potential which is justified since on the one hand the number of positrons in
the region near the axis of nanotube is small, and on the other hand their
contribution to the formation of the total radiation is also small. The problem
is solved in the dipole approximation. The radiation at first harmonic occurs
at zero angle too. At zero angle are radiated both extremely hard and extremely
soft photons due to the medium polarization. The frequency-angular distribution
of number of emitted photons was received. The distribution does not depend on
the azimuthal angle, since the task has cylindrical symmetry. Radiation at the
zero angle is fully circularly polarized. For formation of radiation there is
an energy threshold: lower threshold is due to the polarization of medium, the
upper threshold depends on the oscillation amplitude of channelling positrons.
When the bunch energy coincides with the upper threshold then in radiation
contribute all channeled positrons. Each positron in average radiates one
photon. Thus is formed intensive, quasi-monochromatic and circularly olarized
X-ray photon beam which may have important practical application.

  calibration of the force constant in elastic network models","29 pages, 9 figures, Supp. Mat",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate regression is a widespread computational technique that may give
meaningless results if the explanatory variables are too numerous or highly
collinear. Tikhonov regularization, or ridge regression, is a popular approach
to address this issue. We reveal here a formal analogy between ridge regression
and statistical mechanics, where the objective function is comparable to a free
energy and the ridge parameter plays the role of temperature. This analogy
suggests two new criteria to select a suitable ridge parameter: the
specific-heat (Cv) and the maximum penalty (MP) fits. We apply these methods to
the calibration of the force constant in elastic network models (ENM). This key
parameter determines the amplitude of the predicted atomic fluctuations, and is
commonly obtained by fitting crystallographic B-factors. However, rigid-body
motions are often partially neglected in such fits, even though their
importance has been repeatedly stressed. Considering the full set of rigid-body
and internal degrees of freedom bears significant risks of overfitting, due to
strong correlations between explanatory variables, and requires thus careful
regularization. Using simulated data, we show that ridge regression with the Cv
or MP criterion markedly reduces the error of the estimated force constant, its
across-protein variation, and the number of proteins with unphysical values of
the fit parameters, in comparison with popular regularization schemes such as
generalized cross-validation. When applied to protein crystals, the new methods
provide a more robust calibration of ENM force constants, even though
rigid-body motions account on average for more than 80% of the amplitude of
B-factors. While MP emerges as the optimal choice for fitting crystallographic
B-factors, the Cv fit is more robust to the nature of the data, and is thus an
interesting candidate for other applications.

such as vehicular networks, yet, despite their great modeling power, many
important features of time-varying graphs are still poorly understood. In this
paper, we study the survivability properties of time-varying networks against
unpredictable interruptions. We first show that the traditional definition of
survivability is not effective in time-varying networks, and propose a new
survivability framework. To evaluate the survivability of time-varying networks
under the new framework, we propose two metrics that are analogous to MaxFlow
and MinCut in static networks. We show that some fundamental
survivability-related results such as Menger's Theorem only conditionally hold
in time-varying networks. Then we analyze the complexity of computing the
proposed metrics and develop several approximation algorithms. Finally, we
conduct trace-driven simulations to demonstrate the application of our
survivability framework to the robust design of a real-world bus communication
network.

significantly outperform the conventional recurrent neural networks (RNN),

glucagon pulses, while the role of $\delta$ cells is less clear. Although their
spatial organization and the paracrine/autocrine interactions between them have
been extensively studied, the functional implications of the design principles
are still lacking. In this study, we formulated a mathematical model that
integrates the pulsatility of hormone secretion and the interactions and
organization of islet cells and examined the effects of different cellular
compositions and organizations in mouse and human islets. A common feature of
both species was that islet cells produced synchronous hormone pulses under
low- and high- glucose conditions, while they produced asynchronous hormone
pulses under normal glucose conditions. However, the synchronous coordination
of insulin and glucagon pulses at low glucose was more pronounced in human
islets that had more $\alpha$ cells. When $\beta$ cells were selectively
removed to mimic diabetic conditions, the anti-synchronicity of insulin and
glucagon pulses was deteriorated at high glucose, but it could be partially
recovered when the re-aggregation of remaining cells was considered. Finally,
the third cell type, $\delta$ cells, which introduced additional complexity in
the multicellular system, prevented the excessive synchronization of hormone
pulses. Our computational study suggests that controllable synchronization is a
design principle of pancreatic islets.

spin-0 resonant particle. On the theoretical ground, an interesting question is
whether this new scalar resonance belongs to a strongly coupled sector or a
well-defined weakly coupled theory. A possible UV-completion that has been
widely considered in literature is based on the existence of new vector-like
fermions whose loop contributions---Yukawa-coupled to the new
resonance---explain the observed signal rate. The large total width
preliminarily suggested by data seems to favor a large Yukawa coupling, at the
border of a healthy perturbative definition. This potential problem can be
fixed by introducing multiple vector-like fermions or large electric charges,
bringing back the theory to a weakly coupled regime. However, this solution
risks to be only a low-energy mirage: Large multiplicity or electric charge can
dangerously reintroduce the strong regime by modifying the renormalization
group running of the dimensionless couplings. This issue is also tightly
related to the (in)stability of the scalar potential. First, we study---in the
theoretical setup described above---the parametric behavior of the diphoton
signal rate, total width, and one-loop $\beta$ functions. Then, we numerically
solve the renormalization group equations, taking into account the observed
diphoton signal rate and total width, to investigate the fate of the weakly
coupled theory. We find that---with the only exception of few fine-tuned
directions---weakly coupled interpretations of the excess are brought back to a
strongly coupled regime if the running is taken into account.

carried out for convenient practice. Firstly, a Gaussian filtering method is
proposed to compensate the missing data of the inner scatter image, and
simultaneously avoid too-large values of calculated inner scatter and smooth
the inner scatter field. Secondly, an interlacing-slit scan without detector
gain correction is carried out to enhance the practicality and convenience of
the scatter correction method. Finally, a denoising step for scatter-corrected

amplification. The experimental results show that the improved method can not
only make the scatter correction more robust and convenient, but also achieve a
good quality of scatter-corrected slice images.

[5], which are the subspaces of pure potential games, nonstrategic games and
pure harmonic games. The orthogonal projections onto these subspaces are
represented as the Moore-Penrose inverses of the corresponding linear operators
(i.e., matrices) [5]. Although the representation is compact and nice, no
analytic method is given to calculate Moore- Penrose inverses of these linear
operators. Hence using their results, one cannot verify whether a finite game
belongs to one of these subspaces. In this paper, jumping over calculating
Moore-Penrose inverses of these linear operators directly, via using group
inverses, in the framework of the semitensor product of matrices, we give
explicit polynomial representation for these orthogonal projections and for
potential functions of potential games. Using our results, one not only can
determine whether a finite game belongs to one of these subspaces, but also can
find an arbitrary finite game belonging to one of them. Besides, we give formal
definitions for these types of games by using their payoff functions. Based on
these results, more properties of finite games are revealed.

their experience and roles that best complement the existing roles on the team.
We adopt a mixed-methods approach to explore how users negotiate this dilemma.
Using data from \textit{League of Legends}, we define a similarity space to
operationalize team design constructs about role proficiency, generality, and
congruency. We collect publicly available data from 3.36 million users to test
the influence of these constructs on team performance. We also conduct focus
groups with novice and elite players to understand how players' team design
practices vary with expertise. We find that player proficiency increases team
performance more than team congruency. These findings have implications for
players, designers, and theorists about how to recommend team designs that
jointly prioritize individuals' expertise and teams' compatibility.

On timescales of seconds to hours, the TOA variance exceeds that from
template-fitting errors due to additive noise. We assess contributions to the
total variance from two additional effects: amplitude and phase jitter
intrinsic to single pulses and changes in the interstellar impulse response
from scattering. The three effects have different dependencies on time,
frequency, and pulse signal-to-noise ratio. We use data on 37 pulsars from the
North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves to assess the
individual contributions to the overall intraday noise budget for each pulsar.
We detect jitter in 22 pulsars and estimate the average value of RMS jitter in
our pulsars to be $\sim 1\%$ of pulse phase. We examine how jitter evolves as a
function of frequency and find evidence for evolution. Finally, we compare our
measurements with previous noise parameter estimates and discuss methods to
improve gravitational wave detection pipelines.

morphogenesis, polarization, and cell migration. The precision of gradient
sensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in
the gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of
concentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests
that precision should also increase with detector length in the direction
transverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the
noise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the
precision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest
gradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason
is that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured
concentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these
measurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between
the measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We
demonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional
excitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the
benefit of transverse averaging. Using a REGI-based model, we compute the
optimal two- and three-dimensional detector shapes, and argue that they are
consistent with the shapes of naturally occurring gradient-sensing cell
populations.

study the multicolor light curves for a number of metal-free core-collapse SN
models (25-100 M$_{\odot}$) to provide the indicators for finding and

the evolution of the photosphere's velocity, the luminosity, the duration and
color evolution of the plateau - all the SN phases are helpful to estimate the
parameters of SN progenitor: the mass, the radius, the explosion energy and the
metallicity. We conclude that the multicolor light curves can be potentially
used to identify first generation SNe in the current (Subaru/HSC) and future
transient surveys (LSST, JWST). They are also suitable for identification of
the low-metallicity SNe in the nearby Universe (PTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia).

The Raman modes in MNRs show strong polarization dependence. Besides that the

nonlinear dynamical systems. Instead of the conventional iterative methods, the
discretized nonlinear system is first formulated as a global optimization
problem via the least squares method. The canonical duality theory shows that
this nonconvex minimization problem can be solved deterministically in
polynomial time if a global optimality condition is satisfied. The so-called
pseudo-chaos produced by Runge-Kutta type of linear iterations are mainly due
to the intrinsic numerical error accumulations. Otherwise, the global
optimization problem could be NP-hard and the nonlinear system can be really
chaotic.
  A conjecture is proposed, which reveals the connection between chaos in
nonlinear dynamics and NP-hardness in computer science. The methodology and the
conjecture are verified by applications to the well-known logistic equation, a
forced memristive circuit and the Lorenz system. Computational results show
that the canonical duality theory can be used to identify chaotic systems and
to obtain realistic global optimal solutions in nonlinear dynamical systems.

constraints on those three parameters. The combination of cross-correlation
statistics further improves the constraints by factor of 2. As a result,
upcoming imaging surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope have the
potential to improve the constraints on the primordial non-Gaussianity much
tighter than those obtained from the CMB measurement by Planck, giving us an

of the star strongly depend on the equation of state (EOS). The EOS of
high-density matter is still not clear and several recent observations indicate
restrictions to EOSs. Theoretical studies should elucidate EOSs at high density
and/or high temperature. For instance, many theoretical studies have attempted
to account for the rotation effect of rapidly rotating neutron stars (i.e.,
pulsars). Accordingly, we also apply our EOSs to rapidly rotating stars.
Furthermore, neutron stars generate a strong magnetic field. Several recent
studies indicate that this magnetic field exerts restrictions on the EOS. In
this paper, we focus on the investigation of the inner structures and the
application of our EOSs to rotating stars. We find that one of our EOSs is

incorporation of effects of mesoscopic fluctuations. A hierarchy of equations
relating the correlation and direct correlation functions for the local excess
$\phi({\bf r})$ of the volume fraction of particles $\zeta$ has been obtained,
and an approximation leading to a closed set of equations for the two-point
functions has been introduced. We have solved numerically the self-consistent
equations for one (1D) and three (3D) dimensional models with short-range
attraction and long-rannge repulsion (SALR). Predictions for all the
qualitative properties of the 1D model agree with the exact results, but only
semi-quantitative agreement is obtained in the simplest version of the theory.
The effects of fluctuations in the two considered 3D models are significantly
different, despite very similar properties of these models in the mean-field
approximation. In both cases we obtain the sequence of large - small - large
compressibility for increasing $\zeta$. The very small compressibility is
accompanied by the oscillatory decay of correlations with the correlation
length orders of magnitude larger than the size of particles. Only in one of
the two considered models for decreasing temperature the small compressibility
becomes very small and the large compressibility becomes very large, and
eventually van der Waals loops appear. Further studies are necessary to
determine the nature of the strongly inhomogeneous phase present for
intermediate volume fractions in 3D.

boosted thus losing its jet substructure. Interpreting our tentative results in

extended both the theory and the applications of statistics and probability.
This survey reviews the development of a symbolic technique arising from
classical umbral calculus, as introduced by Rota and Taylor in $1994.$ The
usefulness of this symbolic technique is twofold. The first is to show how new
algebraic identities drive in discovering insights among topics apparently very
far from each other and related to probability and statistics. One of the main
tools is a formal generalization of the convolution of identical probability
distributions, which allows us to employ compound Poisson random variables in
various topics that are only somewhat interrelated. Having got a different and
deeper viewpoint, the second goal is to show how to set up algorithmic
processes performing efficiently algebraic calculations. In particular, the
challenge of finding these symbolic procedures should lead to a new method, and
it poses new problems involving both computational and conceptual issues.
Evidence of efficiency in applying this symbolic method will be shown within
statistical inference, parameter estimation, L\'evy processes, and, more
generally, problems involving multivariate functions. The symbolic
representation of Sheffer polynomial sequences allows us to carry out a
unifying theory of classical, Boolean and free cumulants. Recent connections
within random matrices have extended the applications of the symbolic method.

Moreover, users may choose to utilize public cloud services from multiple

Hamiltonian modulations involving repeated calculations of basic unitaries
resulting in time complexities scaling rapidly with the length of the control
sequence. On the other hand, the bang-bang controls need one-time calculation
of basic unitaries and hence scale much more efficiently. By employing a global
optimization routine such as the genetic algorithm, it is possible to
synthesize not only highly intricate unitaries, but also certain nonunitary
operations. Here we demonstrate the unitary control through the first
implementation of the optimal fixed-point quantum search algorithm in a
three-qubit NMR system. More over, by combining the bang-bang pulses with the
twirling process, we also demonstrate a nonunitary transformation of the
thermal equilibrium state into an effective pure state in a five-qubit NMR

variational formulations are set up and the existence and uniqueness of
solutions is discussed. Error estimates are presented to prove the convergence

work, we investigate a simple approach to numerical calculation of this model
using boundary-integral equation (BIE) methods and boundary-element methods
(BEM). Traditional BEM discretizes the protein--solvent boundary into a set of
boundary elements, or panels, and the approximate solution is defined as a
weighted combination of basis functions with compact support. The resulting BEM
matrix then requires integrating singular or near singular functions, which can
be slow and challenging to compute. Here we investigate the accuracy and
convergence of a simpler representation, namely modeling the unknown surface
charge distribution as a set of discrete point charges on the surface. We find
that at low resolution, point-based BEM is more accurate than panel-based
methods, due to the fact that the protein surface is sampled directly, and can
be of significant value for numerous important calculations that require only
moderate accuracy, such as the preliminary stages of rational drug design and
protein engineering.

these local transformations and by analogy with point process theory, tools
Campbell measures and a general simulation algorithm of

current report is concerned with parametric inference for Gibbs models of

Kullback-Leibler divergence. A detailed algorithm for approximating the
pseudolikelihood maximum is provided. A simulation study seems to show that
bias and variability of the pseudolikelihood maximum decrease when the
tessellated domain grows in size.In the last part of the report, it is shown
that an analogous approach based on the Campbell measure and the KL divergence

maximum can be derived using the same approach starting from a slight
modification of the Campbell measure.

Given that students are in many cases readily available and cheap it is no
surprise that the vast majority of controlled experiments in software
engineering use them. But they can be argued to constitute a convenience sample
that may not represent the target population (typically ""real"" developers),
especially in terms of experience and proficiency. This causes many researchers
(and reviewers) to have reservations about the external validity of
student-based experiments, and claim that students should not be used. Based on
an extensive review of published works that have compared students to
professionals, we find that picking on ""students"" is counterproductive for two
main reasons. First, classifying experimental subjects by their status is
merely a proxy for more important and meaningful classifications, such as
classifying them according to their abilities, and effort should be invested in
defining and using these more meaningful classifications. Second, in many cases
using students is perfectly reasonable, and student subjects can be used to
obtain reliable results and further the research goals. In particular, this
appears to be the case when the study involves basic programming and
comprehension skills, when tools or methodologies that do not require an
extensive learning curve are being compared, and in the initial formative
stages of large industrial research initiatives -- in other words, in many of
the cases that are suitable for controlled experiments of limited scope.

implementing an electron-wave realization of a Fano interferometer using pairs
of coupled quantum point contacts (QPCs). Within this scheme, the discrete
level required for a Fano resonance is provided by pinching off one of the
QPCs, thereby inducing the formation of a quasi-bound state at the center of
its self-consistent potential barrier. Using this system, we demonstrate a form
of \textit{nonequilibrium} Fano resonance (NEFR), in which nonlinear electrical
biasing of the interferometer gives rise to pronounced distortions of its Fano
resonance. Our experimental results are captured well by a quantitative
theoretical model, which considers a system in which a standard two-path Fano
interferometer is coupled to an additional, \textit{intruder}, continuum.
According to this theory, the observed distortions in the Fano resonance arise
\textit{only} in the presence of coupling to the intruder, indicating that the
NEFR provides a sensitive means to infer the presence of weak coupling between
mesoscopic systems.

in traffic data and uses Bayes' Theorem to perform OD. In contrast, the GMM

Spark is a popular alternative engine that promises faster processing times
than the established MapReduce engine. BigBench was chosen for this comparison
because it is the first end-to-end analytics Big Data benchmark and it is
currently under public review as TPCx-BB [4]. One of our goals was to evaluate
the benchmark by performing various scalability tests and validate that it is
able to stress test the processing engines. First, we analyzed the steps
necessary to execute the available MapReduce implementation of BigBench [1] on
Spark. Then, all the 30 BigBench queries were executed on MapReduce/Hive with
different scale factors in order to see how the performance changes with the
increase of the data size. Next, the group of HiveQL queries were executed on
Spark SQL and compared with their respective Hive runtimes. This report gives a

for estimating the hidden communities under DCSBM. Our approach is based on a
convex programming relaxation of the classical (generalized) modularity

the long-term welfare of a population of agents who arrive one by one in a
multi-armed bandit setting. However, each agent is myopic, so in order to
incentivize him to explore options with better long-term prospects, the
principal must offer the agent money. Frazier et al. showed that a simple class
of policies called time-expanded are optimal in the worst case, and
characterized their budget-reward tradeoff.
  The previous work assumed that all agents are equally and uniformly
susceptible to financial incentives. In reality, agents may have different
utility for money. We therefore extend the model of Frazier et al. to allow
agents that have heterogeneous and non-linear utilities for money. The
principal is informed of the agent's tradeoff via a signal that could be more
or less informative.
  Our main result is to show that a convex program can be used to derive a
signal-dependent time-expanded policy which achieves the best possible
Lagrangian reward in the worst case. The worst-case guarantee is matched by
so-called ""Diamonds in the Rough"" instances; the proof that the guarantees
match is based on showing that two different convex programs have the same
optimal solution for these specific instances. These results also extend to the
budgeted case as in Frazier et al. We also show that the optimal policy is
monotone with respect to information, i.e., the approximation ratio of the
optimal policy improves as the signals become more informative.

problem of bounding the number of distinct point-line distances can be reduced
to the problem of bounding the number of tangent pairs among a finite set of

question is of independent interest. In the same vein, we show that $n$ circles
in the plane determine at most $O(n^{3/2})$ points where two or more circles
