preprocessing. It focuses on the Minimum-weight Spanning Tree (MST)
verification problem and establishes tight upper and lower bounds for the time
and message complexities of this problem. Specifically, we provide an MST
verification algorithm that achieves simultaneously O(m) messages and O($\sqrt$
n+D) time, where m is the number of edges in the given graph G, n is the number
of nodes, and D is G's diameter. On the other hand, we show that any MST
verification algorithm must send {\Omega}(m) messages and incur
{\Omega}($\sqrt$ n + D) time in worst case. Our upper bound result appears to
indicate that the verification of an MST may be easier than its construction,
since for MST construction, both lower bounds of {\Omega}(m) messages and
{\Omega}($\sqrt$ n+D time hold, but at the moment there is no known distributed
algorithm that constructs an MST and achieves simultaneously O(m) messages and
O($\sqrt$ n + D) time. Specifically, the best known time-optimal algorithm
(using O($\sqrt$ n + D) time) requires O(m + n 3/2) messages, and the best
known message-optimal algorithm (using O(m) messages) requires O(n) time. On
the other hand, our lower bound results indicate that the verification of an
MST is not significantly easier than its construction.

inequality between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of

join to each other, grow and form a D5-brane. Next, D5- brane is compactified
on two circle and our universe-D3-brane, two D1-brane and some extra energies
are produced. After that, one of the D1-branes, which is more close to the
universe-brane, gives its energy into it, leads to an increase of the
difference between the number of degrees of freedom and the occurring inflation
era. With the disappearance of this D1-brane, the number of degrees of freedom
of boundary surface and bulk region becomes equal and inflation ends. At this
stage, extra energies that are produced due to the compactification cause to an
expansion of universe and deceleration epoch. Finally, another D1-brane,
dissolves in our universe-brane, leads to an inequality between degrees of
freedom and gives rise to a new phase of acceleration.

resonant mass of their mother particle and the invariant mass distribution is
stretched wider than the width of the resonant mass as significant fraction of
tau lepton momenta are carried away by neutrinos escaping undetected at
collider experiments. This paper describes a new approach to reconstruct
resonant masses of heavy particles decaying to tau leptons at such experiments.
A typical example is a Z or Higgs boson decaying to a tau pair. Although the
new technique can be used for each tau lepton separately, I combine two tau
leptons to improve mass resolution by requiring the two tau leptons are lined
up in a transverse plane. The method is simple to implement and complementary
to the collinear approximation technique that works well when tau leptons are
not lined up in a transverse plane. The reconstructed mass can be used as
another variable in analyses that already use a visible tau pair mass and
missing transverse momentum as these variables are not explicitly used in the
stochastic mass-reconstruction to select signal-like events.

Rubidium vapor involving a Rydberg state. We observe FWM signals with dephasing
times up to 7 ns, strongly dependent on the excitation bandwidth to the Rydberg
state. The excitation to the Rydberg state is driven by a pulsed two-photon
transition on ns time scales. Combined with a third cw de-excitation laser, a
strongly directional and collective emission is generated according to a
combination of the phase matching effect and averaging over Doppler classes. In
contrast to a previous report [1] using off-resonant FWM, at a resonant FWM
scheme we observe additional revivals of the signal shortly after the incident
pulse has ended. We infer that this is a revival of motion-induced constructive
interference between the coherent emissions of the thermal atoms. The resonant
FWM scheme reveals a richer temporal structure of the signals, compared to
similar, but off-resonant excitation schemes. A simple explanation lies in the
selectivity of Doppler classes. Our numerical simulations based on a four-level

since it challenges predictability and timeliness. Current efforts are starting
to address the inclusion of a controllable level of dynamicity in real-time
systems to increase the degree of freedom or flexibility in the execution of
real-time systems. This is mainly achieved by imposing a set of bounds and
limitations to the allowed system structure and operations during a transition.
The ultimate goal is to time-bound the duration and result of the system state
transitions. One of the main obstacles for run-time transitions is the
difficulty in characterizing the different operations and phases of a run-time
system transition to guarantee a time bound for each phase. In this paper, an
infrastructure is described to ensure the timely execution of state transitions
that can be safely incorporated and performed at run-time in a component-based
real-time system, preserving its temporal properties. The infrastructure allows
to perform different management operations to modify components at run-time
ensuring the overall schedulability of the system. The infrastructure is
validated by its implementation in a specific component-based framework.

fundamental problem in stellar evolution calculations. In Paper~I we showed
that new asteroseismic observations of these stars imply they have either very
large convective cores or semiconvection/partially mixed zones that trap
g-modes. We probe this mixing by inferring the relative lifetimes of asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) and horizontal branch (HB) from $R_2$, the observed ratio of
these stars in recent HST photometry of 48 Galactic globular clusters. Our new
determinations of $R_2$ are more self-consistent than those of previous studies
and our overall calculation of $R_2 = 0.117 \pm 0.005$ is the most
statistically robust now available. We also establish that the luminosity
difference between the HB and the AGB clump is $\Delta
\log{L}_\text{HB}^\text{AGB} = 0.455 \pm 0.012$. Our results accord with
earlier findings that standard models predict a lower $R_2$ than is observed.
We demonstrate that the dominant sources of uncertainty in models are the
prescription for mixing and the stochastic effects that can result from its
numerical treatment. The luminosity probability density functions that we
derive from observations feature a sharp peak near the AGB clump. This
constitutes a strong new argument against core breathing pulses, which broaden
the predicted width of the peak. We conclude that the two mixing schemes that
can match the asteroseismology are capable of matching globular cluster
observations, but only if (i) core breathing pulses are avoided in models with
a semiconvection/partially mixed zone, or (ii) that models with large
convective cores have a particular depth of mixing beneath the Schwarzschild
boundary during subsequent early-AGB `gravonuclear' convection.

galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies.
  Methods: We obtained high-resolution interferometric observations of HCN and
HCO$^+$ $J=1\rightarrow0$ and $J=2\rightarrow1$ of the ultraluminous infrared
galaxy Mrk~231 with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We also use
previously published observations of HCN and HCO$^+$ $J=1\rightarrow0$ and
$J=3\rightarrow2$, and HNC $J=1\rightarrow0$ in the same source.
  Results: In the line wings of the HCN, HCO$^+$, and HNC emission, we find
that these three molecular species exhibit features at distinct velocities
which differ between the species. The features are not consistent with emission
lines of other molecular species. Through radiative transfer modelling of the
HCN and HCO$^+$ outflow emission we find an average abundance ratio
$X(\mathrm{HCN})/X(\mathrm{HCO}^+)\gtrsim1000$. Assuming a clumpy outflow,
modelling of the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission produces strongly inconsistent
outflow masses.
  Conclusions: Both the anti-correlated outflow features of HCN and HCO$^+$ and
the different outflow masses calculated from the radiative transfer models of
the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission suggest that the outflow is chemically
differentiated. The separation between HCN and HCO$^+$ could be an indicator of
shock fronts present in the outflow, since the HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio is expected to
be elevated in shocked regions. Our result shows that studies of the chemistry
in large-scale galactic outflows can be used to better understand the physical
properties of these outflows and their effects on the interstellar medium (ISM)
in the galaxy.

$\sigma_P(q)$ of a point $q$ is the number of $d$-simplices with vertices in
$P$ that contain $q$ in their convex hulls. The simplicial depth is a notion of
data depth with many applications in robust statistics and computational
geometry. Computing the simplicial depth of a point is known to be a
challenging problem. The trivial solution requires $O(n^{d+1})$ time whereas it
is generally believed that one cannot do better than $O(n^{d-1})$. In this
paper, we consider approximation algorithms for computing the simplicial depth
of a point. For $d=2$, we present a new data structure that can approximate the
simplicial depth in polylogarithmic time, using polylogarithmic query time. In
3D, we can approximate the simplicial depth of a given point in near-linear
time, which is clearly optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. For higher
dimensions, we consider two approximation algorithms with different worst-case
scenarios. By combining these approaches, we compute a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the simplicial depth in time
$\tilde{O}(n^{d/2 + 1})$ ignoring polylogarithmic factor. All of these
algorithms are Monte Carlo algorithms. Furthermore, we present a simple
strategy to compute the simplicial depth exactly in $O(n^d \log n)$ time, which
provides the first improvement over the trivial $O(n^{d+1})$ time algorithm for
$d>4$. Finally, we show that computing the simplicial depth exactly is

fault diagnosis. The objective is to sense the environment, learn the normal
system state, and then periodically classify whether the instantaneous state
deviates from the normal one or not. A flexible and cost-effective way of
monitoring a system state is to use a wireless sensor network. In the
traditional approach, the sensors encode their observations and transmit them
to a fusion center by means of some interference avoiding channel access
method. The fusion center then decodes all the data and classifies the
corresponding system state. As this approach can be highly inefficient in terms
of energy consumption, in this paper we propose a transmission scheme that
exploits interference for carrying out the anomaly detection directly in the
air. In other words, the wireless channel helps the fusion center to retrieve
the sought classification outcome immediately from the channel output. To
achieve this, the chosen learning model is linear support vector machines.
After discussing the proposed scheme and proving its reliability, we present
numerical examples demonstrating that the scheme reduces the energy consumption
for anomaly detection by up to 53% compared to a strategy that uses time
division multiple-access.

sufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to a

parameter couples bilinearly to the strain, which supresses the fluctuations of
the nematic order parameter itself and lowers the upper critical dimension,
yielding mean-field behaviour of the nematic degrees of freedom for $d>2$. This
is consistent with the measured Currie-Weiss behaviour of the nematic
susceptibility. Here we reconcile this apparent contradiction between
pronounced magnetic fluctuations and mean-field behaviour of the nematic
degrees of freedom. We show, by developing a $\varphi^4$ theory for the nematic
degrees of freedom, that the coupling to elastic strain does not suppress the
fluctuations that cause the nematic order in the first place (magnetic
fluctuations), yet it does transform the Ising-nematic transition into a
mean-field transition. In addition, we demonstrate that the mean field behavior

self-interaction, circularization, and the accompanying accretion through the
black hole horizon. We find that the relativistic precession leads to the
formation of a self-crossing shock. The dissipated kinetic energy heats up the
incoming debris and efficiently generates a quasi-spherical outflow. The
self-interaction is modulated because of the feedback exerted by the flow on
itself. The debris quickly forms a thick, almost marginally bound disc that
remains turbulent for many orbital periods. Initially, the accretion through
the black hole horizon results from the self-interaction, while in the later
stages it is dominated by the debris originally ejected in the shocked region,
as it gradually falls back towards the hole. The effective viscosity in the
debris disc stems from the original hydrodynamical turbulence, which dominates
over the magnetic component. The radiative efficiency is very low because of
low energetics of the gas crossing the horizon and large optical depth that
results in photon trapping.

a variational ansatz, whose results turn out to coincide qualitatively with
those obtained from the Thomas-Fermi approximation. In particular, a
first-order quantum phase transition from the superfluid phase to the

smaller disorder strengths. Furthermore, depending on the respective system

improve her method in two important points, and we clarify that it concerns a

the method by Kowalewski to prove two results. First, without using the
Hamiltonian structure of the Clebsch system, we show that the integration of
the equations of motion may be achieved by computing four Abelian integrals.
Next, taking into account its Hamiltonian structure, we show that two

empirical spectra is a well-established approach to measure the atmospheric
parameters of FGK stars with a high internal consistency. Extending it towards
cooler stars still remains a challenge. Aims: We address this question by
improving the interpolator of the MILES (Medium-resolution INT Library of
Empirical Spectra) library in the low effective temperature regime (Tefff <
4800 K), and we refine the determination of the parameters of the cool MILES
stars. Methods: We use the ULySS package to determine the atmospheric
parameters (Teff, logg and [Fe/H]), and measure the biases of the results with
respect to our updated compilation of parameters calibrated against theoretical
spectra. After correcting some systematic effects, we compute a new
interpolator that we finally use to redetermine the atmospheric parameters
homogeneously and assess the biases. Results: Based on an updated literature
compilation, we determine Teff in a more accurate and unbiased manner compared
to those determined with the original interpolator. The validity range is
extended downwards to about Teff = 2900 K compared to 3500 K previously. The
mean residual biases on Teff, logg, and [Fe/H], with respect to the literature
compilation for the coolest stars (Teff <= 3800 K) computed using the new
interpolator, are -15 K, -0.02 dex, and 0.02 dex respectively. The
corresponding estimations of the external precision are 63 K, 0.23 dex, and
0.15 dex respectively. For the stars with Teff in the range 3800 - 4200 K, the
determinations of Teff and [Fe/H] have been slightly improved. At higher
temperatures, the new interpolator is comparable to the original one. The new
version of the interpolator is publicly available.

carry a continuous and classical spin. The model includes standard
ferromagnetic interactions between spins of two different particles, and a
nonstandard coupling between spin and velocity of the same particle inspired by
the coupling observed in self-propelled hard discs. Because of this coupling
Galilean invariance is broken and the conserved linear momentum associated to
translation invariance is not proportional to the velocity of the center of
mass. Also, the dynamics is not invariant under a global rotation of the spins
alone. This, in principle, leaves room for collective motion and thus raises
the question whether collective motion can arise in Hamiltonian systems. We
study the statistical mechanics of such a system, and show that, in the fully
connected (or mean-field) case, a transition to collective motion does exist in
spite of momentum conservation. Interestingly, the velocity of the center of
mass, which in the absence of Galilean invariance, is a relevant variable, also
feeds back on the magnetization properties, as it acts as an external magnetic
field that smoothens the transition. Molecular dynamics simulations of finite
size systems indeed reveal a rich phase diagram, with a transition from a
disordered to a homogeneous polar phase, but also more complex inhomogeneous
phases with local order interrupted by topological defects.

large amplitudes of nonaffine displacement exhibit a collective behavior;
namely, they tend to aggregate into relatively compact clusters that become

soon be able to measure them directly for the first time. Binaries of
stellar-mass black holes are among the most interesting sources for these

search in the data stream. To reduce the number of templates to develop, one
must restrict some of the physical parameters to a certain range of values
predicted by either (electromagnetic) observations or theoretical modeling. In
this work we show that ""hyperstellar"" black holes (HSBs) with masses $30
\lesssim M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 100$, i.e black holes significantly
larger than the nominal $10\,M_{\odot}$, will have an associated low value for
the spin, i.e. $a<0.5$. We prove that this is true regardless of the formation
channel, and that when two HSBs build a binary, each of the spin magnitudes is
also low, and the binary members have similar masses. We also address the
distribution of the eccentricities of HSB binaries in dense stellar systems
using a large suite of three-body scattering experiments that include
binary-single interactions and long-lived hierarchical systems with a highly
accurate integrator, including relativistic corrections up to ${\cal
O}(1/c^5)$. We find that most sources in the detector band will have nearly
zero eccentricities. This correlation between large, similar masses, low spin

the calculation of sound speeds in the nucleon-hyperon matter composed of
neutrons (n), protons (p), electrons (e), muons ($\mu$), as well as $\rm

re-model previously published phase curves of CoRoT-1b, TrES-2b and HAT-P-7b
and infer albedos and recirculation efficiencies. These are then compared to
previous estimates based on secondary eclipse data. We use a physically
consistent model to construct optical phase curves. This model takes Lambertian
reflection, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler boosting into
account. CoRoT-1b shows a non-negligible scattering albedo (0.11<AS<0.3 at 95%
confidence) as well as small day-night temperature contrasts, indicative of
moderate to high re-distribution of energy between dayside and nightside. These
values are contrary to previous secondary eclipse and phase curve analyses. In
the case of HAT-P-7b, model results suggest relatively high scattering albedo
(AS=0.3). This confirms previous phase curve analysis, however, it is in slight
contradiction to values inferred from secondary eclipse data. For TrES-2b, both
approaches yield very similar estimates of albedo and heat recirculation.
Discrepancies between recirculation and albedo values as inferred from
secondary eclipse and optical phase curve analyses might be interpreted as a
hint that optical and IR observations probe different atmospheric layers, and
hence temperatures.

acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for the ideal and
enriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of the
elastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In
particular, P- and S- waves are separated by the application of an electric
field. The divergence angle between P- and S-waves strongly depends on the
applied electrostatic excitation. The influence of the electric field is
sensitive to material models. Thus, for ideal dielectric model the in-plane
shear velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the
enriched model the velocity may decreases depending on material constants.
Similarly, the divergence angle gradually increases with an increase in
electric field, while for the enriched model, the angle may be bounded.
Material compressibility affects the P-wave velocity, and, for relatively
compressible materials, the slowness curves evolve from circular to elliptical
shapes manifesting in an increase of the reflection angle of P-waves. As a

compressibility.

down purchasing by age and gender, we find that the amount of money spent on
online purchases grows sharply with age, peaking in late 30s. Men are more
frequent online purchasers and spend more money when compared to women. Linking
online shopping to income, we find that shoppers from more affluent areas
purchase more expensive items and buy them more frequently, resulting in
significantly more money spent on online purchases. We also look at dynamics of
purchasing behavior and observe daily and weekly cycles in purchasing behavior,
similarly to other online activities.
  More specifically, we observe temporal patterns in purchasing behavior
suggesting shoppers have finite budgets: the more expensive an item, the longer
the shopper waits since the last purchase to buy it. We also observe that
shoppers who email each other purchase more similar items than socially
unconnected shoppers, and this effect is particularly evident among women.
Finally, we build a model to predict when shoppers will make a purchase and how
much will spend on it. We find that temporal features improve prediction
accuracy over competitive baselines. A better understanding of consumer

an entirely real energy spectrum. However, such theories can also admit of
energy spectra in which energies come in complex conjugate pairs, and can even
admit of Hamiltonians that cannot be diagonalized at all. Hermiticity is just a
particular realization of $PT$ symmetry, with $PT$ symmetry being the more
general. These $PT$ theories are themselves part of an even broader class of
theories, theories that can be characterized by possessing some general
antilinear symmetry, as that requirement alone is a both necessary and
sufficient condition for the time-independent evolution of scalar products,
with all the different realizations of the $PT$ symmetry program then being
obtained. Use of complex Lorentz invariance allows us to show that the
antilinear symmetry is uniquely specified to be $CPT$, with the $CPT$ theorem
thus being extended to the non-Hermitian case. For theories that are separately
charge conjugation invariant, the results of the $PT$-symmetry program then
follow. We show that in order to construct the correct classical action needed
for a path integral quantization one must impose $CPT$ symmetry on each
classical path, a requirement that has no counterpart in any Hermiticity
condition since Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the
quantization has been performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been
constructed. We show that whether or not a $CPT$-invariant Hamiltonian is
Hermitian is a property of the solutions to the theory and not of the
Hamiltonian itself. Thus Hermiticity never needs to be postulated at all.

efficiently summarizes genome-wide polymorphism data and shapes a variety of
allele frequency-based summary statistics. While existing theory typically
features equilibrium conditions, emerging methodology requires an analytical
understanding of the build-up of the allele frequencies over time. In this
work, we use the framework of Poisson random fields to derive new
representations of the non-equilibrium AFS for the case of a Wright-Fisher
population model with selection. In our approach, the AFS is a scaling-limit of
the expectation of a Poisson stochastic integral and the representation of the
non-equilibrium AFS arises in terms of a fixation time probability
distribution. The known duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion process and
a birth and death process generalizing Kingman's coalescent yields an
additional representation. The results carry over to the setting of a random
sample drawn from the population and provide the non-equilibrium behavior of
sample statistics. Our findings are consistent with and extend a previous
approach where the non-equilibrium AFS solves a partial differential forward
equation with a non-traditional boundary condition. Moreover, we provide a
bridge to previous coalescent-based work, and hence tie several frameworks
together. Since frequency-based summary statistics are widely used in
population genetics, for example, to identify candidate loci of adaptive
evolution, to infer the demographic history of a population, or to improve our
understanding of the underlying mechanics of speciation events, the presented
results are potentially useful for a broad range of topics.

high ionization yield), akin to a highly-underquenched Penning mixture.
Scintillation photons travel far from a primary ionization site before
converting into photoionization electrons. Using standard TPC methods, we can
separately count both the primary ionization electrons (which occur along a
dense track) and the scintillation-ionization electrons (which will occur over
a large spherical region) without the use of PMTs. The scheme is compatible
with very large detectors, in both two-phase and single-phase high pressure

distances for which the Besicovitch Covering Property (BCP) holds. In
particular, we prove that a stratified group admits homogeneous distances for
which BCP holds if and only if the group has step 1 or 2. These results are
obtained as consequences of a more general study of homogeneous quasi-distances
on graded groups. Namely, we prove that a positively graded group admits
continuous homogeneous quasi-distances satisfying BCP if and only if any two
different layers of the associated positive grading of its Lie algebra commute.
The validity of BCP has several consequences. Its connections with the theory
of differentiation of measures is one of the main motivations of the present
paper. As a consequence of our results, we get for instance that a stratified
group can be equipped with some homogeneous distance so that the
differentiation theorem holds for each locally finite Borel measure if and only
if the group has step 1 or 2. The techniques developed in this paper allow also
us to prove that sub-Riemannian distances on stratified groups of step 2 or
higher never satisfy BCP. Using blow-up techniques this is shown to imply that
on a sub-Riemannian manifold the differentiation theorem does not hold for some
locally finite Borel measure.

networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering

are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and

full generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of

connection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows
us to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right

various recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations
via a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\log n$ is considered to be
the standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex
methods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right
circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser),
to recover very small clusters (up to $\sqrt{\log n}$ size), if there are just
a few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$).

particular realization of Split Supersymmetry in which the same small parameter
suppresses gaugino masses relative to scalar soft masses, scalar soft masses
relative to the gravitino mass, and the UV cutoff or string scale relative to
the Planck scale. This scenario has many phenomenologically interesting

possibility of a consistent effective field theory understanding of the

pre-main-sequence stars), both morhologically and kinematically, we derive the
following. The gas surface density near the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is
well represented by a power law, Sigma(b)=72 Msun/pc^2(b/pc)^{-5/8} for our
entire range, 0.05<b/pc<8.5, of distance from the filament ridge. Essentially
all protostars lie on the ISF or other filament ridges, while almost all
pre-main-sequence stars do not. Combined with the fact that protostars move <1
kms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster, this
implies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from
the filaments. The ISF is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are
progressively moving south, with separations of a few Myr in time and 3 pc in
space. This, combined with the filament's observed undulations (spatial and
velocity), suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the
filament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected Orion
A and B into stars in discrete episodes. We construct an axially symmetric gas
density profile rho(r)=16 Msun/pc^3(r/pc)^{-13/8}. The model implies that the
observed magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed
undulations, suggesting that the filament's transverse waves are magnetically
induced. Because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament
on larger scales, the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived.
Protostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the
protostars, not the other way around. The model also implies that the ISF is
kinematically young, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. The
southern filament has a broken power law, which matches the ISF profile for
2.5<b/pc<8.5, but is shallower closer in. It is also kinematically older than
the ISF.

we show that spacings derive not only from eccentricities, but also from
inclinations. Flatter systems attain tighter spacings, a consequence of an
eccentricity equilibrium between gravitational scatterings, which increase
eccentricities, and mergers, which damp them. Dynamical friction by residual
disk gas plays a critical role in regulating mergers and in damping
inclinations and eccentricities. Systems with moderate gas damping and high
solid surface density spawn gas-enveloped super-Earths with tight spacings,
small eccentricities, and small inclinations. Systems in which super-Earths
coagulate without as much ambient gas, in disks with low solid surface density,
produce rocky planets with wider spacings, larger eccentricities, and larger
mutual inclinations. A combination of both populations can reproduce the
observed distributions of spacings, period ratios, transiting planet
multiplicities, and transit duration ratios exhibited by Kepler super-Earths.
The two populations, both formed in situ, also help to explain observed trends
of eccentricity vs. planet size, and bulk density vs. method of mass
measurement (radial velocities vs. transit timing variations). Simplifications
made in this study --- including the limited timespan of the simulations, and
the approximate treatments of gas dynamical friction and gas depletion history
--- should be improved upon in future work to enable a detailed quantitative
comparison to the observations.

the causality-violating effective action values at low-energy to their

be interpreted as backwards-in-time coordinate jumps as the photon encounters
the shock wavefront, and we illustrate how the resulting causality problems

a mystery. Here we present the first absorption-line measurements of its
metallicity, using HST/COS UV spectra of three AGN lying behind the Cloud

Voigt-profile fitting of the S II 1250, 1253, 1259 triplet together with

finding that the Smith Cloud is metal-enriched lends support to scenarios where
it represents recycled Galactic material rather than the remnant of a dwarf
galaxy or accreting intergalactic gas. The metallicity and trajectory of the

accreted cooling gas from the corona during its fountain trajectory, as

the TA regardless of whether the UHECRs are composed of protons or heavier
nuclei. We then check for consistency of the hot and warm spots from M82 and
Cen A with the full-sky isotropic signal from all SMBHs within the GZK radius.

due to M82 and Cen A, regardless of whether TDEs are the source of UHECRs. We
find that the isotropic flux implied by the luminosity density inferred from

corresponding discrete functionals for the location of mesh vertices. It is
shown that if the meshing functional satisfies a coercivity condition, then the
mesh of the semi-discrete MMPDE is nonsingular for all time if it is
nonsingular initially. Moreover, the altitudes and volumes of its elements are
bounded below by positive numbers depending only on the number of elements, the

stopping criterion in computation. Finally, the mesh trajectory has limiting
meshes which are critical points of the discrete functional. The convergence of
the mesh trajectory can be guaranteed when a stronger condition is placed on
the meshing functional. Two meshing functionals based on alignment and
equidistribution are known to satisfy the coercivity condition. The results

two necessary and sufficient conditions for such frameworks to be universally

us to prove that Kneser and $q$-Kneser graphs are UVC. Lastly, we show that

entities in text. Text mentions are often noisy, containing spurious or missing
words. Efficient algorithms for detecting approximate entity mentions follow
one of two general techniques. The first approach is to build an index on the
entities and perform index lookups of document substrings. The second approach
recognizes that the number of substrings generated from documents can explode
to large numbers, to get around this, they use a filter to prune many such
substrings which do not match any dictionary entity and then only verify the
remaining substrings if they are entity mentions of dictionary entities, by
means of a text join. The choice between the index-based approach and the
filter & verification-based approach is a case-to-case decision as the best
approach depends on the characteristics of the input entity dictionary, for
example frequency of entity mentions. Choosing the right approach for the
setting can make a substantial difference in execution time. Making this choice
is however non-trivial as there are parameters within each of the approaches
that make the space of possible approaches very large. In this paper, we
present a cost-based operator for making the choice among execution plans for
entity extraction. Since we need to deal with large dictionaries and even
larger large datasets, our operator is developed for implementations of
MapReduce distributed algorithms.

baseline of 11 years, a magnitude range of 12<=V<=16.5 (1.18-0.94 MSun), and a
1 deg. diameter region on the sky. With the addition of a Dominion
Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) data set we extend our bright limit to V = 10.8
and, for some stars, extend our time baseline to 35 years. Our magnitude limits
include solar-mass main-sequence stars, subgiants, giants, and blue stragglers
(BSs), and our spatial coverage extends radially to 17 pc (~13 core radii). For
the WIYN data we find a measurement precision of 0.4 km/s for narrow-lined
stars. We have measured RVs for 1046 stars in the direction of NGC 188, finding
473 to be likely cluster members. We detect 124 velocity-variable cluster
members, all of which are likely to be dynamically hard-binary stars. Using our
single member stars, we find an average cluster RV of -42.36 +/- 0.04 km/s. We
use our precise RV and proper-motion membership data to greatly reduce
field-star contamination in our cleaned color-magnitude diagram, from which we
identify six stars of note that lie far from a standard single-star isochrone.
We find the binaries to be centrally concentrated, providing evidence for the
presence of mass segregation in NGC 188. We observe the BSs to populate a
bimodal spatial distribution that is not centrally concentrated, suggesting
that we may be observing two populations of BSs in NGC 188, including a
centrally concentrated distribution as well as a halo population. Finally, we
find NGC 188 to have a global RV dispersion of 0.64 +/- 0.04 km/s. When
corrected for unresolved binaries, the NGC 188 RV dispersion has a nearly
isothermal radial distribution. We use this mean-corrected velocity dispersion
to derive a virial mass of 2300 +/- 460 MSun.

the ab initio simultaneous analysis of the formation history and morphology of

and produces physical reconstructions of the dark matter distribution that
underlies observed galaxies, by assimilating the survey data into a
cosmological structure formation model. The method, based on Bayesian
probability theory, provides accurate means of uncertainty quantification. We
demonstrate the application of BORG to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and
describe the primordial and late-time large-scale structure in the observed

the cosmological initial conditions and of the formation history of the
observed structures. We then use these results for several cosmographic
projects aiming at analyzing and classifying the large-scale structure. In
particular, we build an enhanced catalog of cosmic voids probed at the level of
the dark matter distribution, deeper than with the galaxies. We present
detailed probabilistic maps of the dynamic cosmic web, and offer a general

smaller population of PNe show hydrogen-deficient and helium- and

considerable differences are expected in physical properties of these objects

how a chemistry-dependent formulation of the heat conduction affects physical
properties and how it affects the X-ray emission from PN bubbles of
hydrogen-deficient stars. We extend the description of heat conduction in our
radiation hydrodynamics code to work with any chemical composition. We then
compare the bubble-formation process with a representative PN model using both
the new and the old descriptions. We also compare differences in the resulting
X-ray temperature and luminosity observables of the two descriptions. The
improved equations show that the heat conduction in our representative model of
a hydrogen-deficient PN is nearly as efficient with the chemistry-dependent
description; a lower value on the diffusion coefficient is compensated by a
slightly steeper temperature gradient. The bubble becomes somewhat hotter with
the improved equations, but differences are otherwise minute. The observable
properties of the bubble in terms of the X-ray temperature and luminosity are
seemingly unaffected.

Specifically, we carefully introduce a price metric for distributed beamforming
design which fortunately allows efficient closed-form solutions to the per-user
beam-vector optimization problem. The convergence of the distributed
pricing-based beamforming design is theoretically proven. Furthermore, we
present an implementation strategy of the proposed distributed algorithm with
limited information exchange. Numerical results show that our algorithm
converges much faster than existing algorithms, while yielding comparable,
sometimes even better performance in terms of the WS-EE. Finally, by taking the
backhaul power consumption into account, it is interesting to show that the
proposed algorithm with limited information exchange achieves better WS-EE than
the full information exchange based algorithm in some special cases.

from the measurement of the ratio of secondary-to-primary nuclei, such as the
boron (B)/carbon (C) ratio, which provides an estimate of the amount of matter
traversed by CRs during their propagation, the so called CR grammage. However,
after being released by their parent sources, for instance supernova remnants
(SNRs), CRs must cross the disc of the Galaxy, before entering the much lower
density halo, in which they are believed to spend most of the time before
eventually escaping the Galaxy. In the near-source region, the CR propagation
is shown to be dominated by the non-linear self-generation of waves. Here we
show that due to this effect, the time that CRs with energies up to $\sim$ 10
TeV spend within a distance $L_{c}\sim 100$ pc from the sources is much larger
than naive estimates would suggest. The corresponding grammage is close to
current estimates of the total grammage traversed throughout the whole Galaxy.
Moreover, there is an irreducible grammage that CRs traverse while trapped
downstream of the shock that accelerated them, though this contribution is
rather uncertain. We conclude that at energies $\lesssim 1$ TeV, the observed
grammage is heavily affected by the near-source non-linear trapping of CRs, and
at energies $\gtrsim 1$ TeV it is affected by the source grammage. As a result,
the measurement of the B/C ratio should be used very cautiously as an indicator
of the propagation of CRs on large Galactic scales.

Starting with a complete tree-level scattering amplitude of n+2 particles in
five dimensions, one assumes that two of them cannot be ""detected"" and
therefore an integration over their LIPS is carried out. The resulting object,
function of the remaining n particles, is taken to be four-dimensional by
restricting the corresponding momenta. We perform this procedure in the context
of the tree-level CHY formulation of amplitudes. The scattering equations
obtained in the procedure coincide with those derived by Geyer et al from
ambitwistor constructions and recently studied by two of the authors for
bi-adjoint scalars. They have two sectors of solutions: regular and singular.
We prove that the contribution from regular solutions generically gives rise to
unphysical poles. However, using a BCFW argument we prove that the unphysical
contributions are always homogeneous functions of the loop momentum and can be
discarded. We also show that the contribution from singular solutions turns out
to be homogeneous as well.

topic models over the entire class with different random seeds, generating a

from the classification area, generating a set of sample models. Finally, we
perform a topic alignment between each pair of models by computing the
Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) between the word probability distributions for
each topic. We take two measures on each model alignment: alignment distance
and topic overlap. We find that sample models with a large sample size
typically have an alignment distance that falls in the range of the alignment
distance between spanning models. Unsurprisingly, as sample size increases,
alignment distance decreases. We also find that the topic overlap increases as
sample size increases. However, the decomposition of these measures by sample
size differs by number of topics and by classification area. We speculate that
these measures could be used to find classes which have a common ""canon""
discussed among all books in the area, as shown by high topic overlap and low

the standard deviation of concentration, which is a global parameter commonly
employed in studies of mixing, we instead use multiscale tools adapted from
studies of chaotic flows or intermittent turbulent mixing: concentration
spectra and second and fourth moments of the probability density functions of
scalar gradients. Not only can these tools be used in open flows, but they also
allow for scale-by-scale analysis. Strikingly, diffusiophoresis is shown to
affect all scales, although more particularly the small ones, resulting in a
change of scalar intermittency and in an unusual scale bridging spanning more
than seven orders of magnitude. By quantifying the averaged impact of
diffusiophoresis on the macroscale mixing, we explain why the effects observed
are consistent with the introduction of an effective P\'eclet number.

in this brain network is a hallmark feature of patients with increased anxiety

understanding of precisely what mechanisms generates these behaviors.
  We attempt to investigate a collection of connectivity hypotheses of OCD by
means of a computational model of the brain circuitry that governs reward and
motion execution. Mathematically, we use methods from ordinary differential
equations and continuous time dynamical systems. We use classical analytical
methods as well as computational approaches to study phenomena in the phase
plane (e.g., behavior of the system's solutions when given certain initial
conditions) and in the parameter space (e.g., sensitive dependence of initial
conditions).

different abnormalities in the network connectivity profiles. We suggest that
it is combinations of parameters (connectivity strengths between regions),

provides the best basis for predicting behavior, and for understanding the

inversion-symmetric magnets has a new internal degree of freedom associated
with the rotation of helicity, i.e. the ""spin"" of the skyrmion as a particle,

The orbital and spin degree of freedoms of an individual skyrmion can couple to
each other, and give rise to unusual behavior that is absent for the skyrmions

how smoking behaviour and the network structure get reconfigured by changing
social norms. Our results are consistent with empirical findings: The
prevalence of smoking was reduced, remaining smokers were preferentially
connected among each other and formed increasingly marginalised clusters. We
propose that self-amplifying feedbacks between individual behaviour and dynamic

integer units of $\hbar$. This remarkable result, which does not appear to be
implicit in the assumptions of the model, can be interpreted as a `theoretical

that electrons in superconductors reside in mesoscopic orbits with orbital
angular momentum $\hbar/2$. This implies that both in superconductors and in
ferromagnets the long-range order results from elementary units of identical

galactic nuclei. Applying the pulsar outer-magnetospheric particle accelerator
theory to black-hole magnetospheres, we demonstrate that an electric field is
exerted along the magnetic field lines near the event horizon of a rotating
black hole. In this particle accelerator (or a gap), electrons and positrons
are created by photon-photon collisions and accelerated in the opposite
directions by this electric field, efficiently emitting gamma-rays via
curvature and inverse-Compton processes. It is shown that a gap arises around
the null charge surface formed by the frame-dragging effect, provided that
there is no current injection across the gap boundaries. The gap is dissipating
a part of the hole's rotational energy, and the resultant gamma-ray luminosity
increases with decreasing plasma accretion from the surroundings. Considering
an extremely rotating supermassive black hole, we show that such a gap
reproduces the significant very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray flux observed from
the radio galaxy IC 310, provided that the accretion rate becomes much less
than the Eddington rate particularly during its flare phase. It is found that
the curvature process dominates the inverse-Compton process in the
magnetosphere of IC~310, and that the observed power-law-like spectrum in VHE
gamma-rays can be explained to some extent by a superposition of the curvature
emissions with varying curvature radius. It is predicted that the VHE spectrum
extends into higher energies with increasing VHE photon flux.

probabilistic automata were re-proposed by Segala in 1995 which are more

of equivalences and their characteristics have been studied mostly
independently. In this paper, we consider Segala's automata, and propose a
novel notion of distribution-based bisimulation by joining the existing
equivalence and bisimilarities. We demonstrate the utility of our definition by
studying distribution-based bisimulation metrics, which gives rise to a robust
notion of equivalence for Rabin's automata. We compare our notions of
bisimulation to some existing distribution-based bisimulations and discuss
their compositionality and relations to trace equivalence. Finally, we show the

player $C$ so that he can recover $s$ with certainty? Further, how much time
does player $A$ need to spend to compute the sent bits and how much time does
player $C$ need to recover the string $s$?
  This problem has a certain number of applications, for example in databases,
where each of the two parties possesses a set of $n$ key-value pairs, where
keys are from the universe $[u]$ and values are from $[\sigma]$ and usually
$n\ll u$. In this paper, we show a time and message-size optimal Las Vegas

$2^{\Theta(\log\sigma+\log (u/n))}$. The additional running time incurred by
the reduction is linear randomized for player $A$ and linear deterministic for

Reed-Solomon codes, the reduction gives a protocol that transmits $O(k(\log

and therefore represent sharp peaks in the density of states. This can enable
exceptionally strong electron pairing in certain clusters composed of tens to
hundreds of atoms. In a finite system, such as a free nanocluster or a nucleus,
pairing is observed most clearly via its effect on the energy spectrum of the
constituent fermions. Accordingly, we performed a photoionization spectroscopy
study of size-resolved aluminum nanoclusters and observed a rapid rise of the
near-threshold density of states of several clusters ($Al_{37,44,66,68}$) with
decreasing temperature. The characteristics of this behavior are consistent
with compression of the density of states by a pairing transition into a
high-temperature superconducting state with $T_c$>~100 K. This value exceeds
that of bulk aluminum by two orders of magnitude. These results highlight the
potential of novel pairing effects in size-quantized systems and the
possibility to attain even higher critical temperatures by optimizing the
particles' size and composition. As a new class of high-temperature

theories. It were proved by L. Braud and A. Carayol that well-orderings in the
hierarchy are the well-orderings with order types less than $\varepsilon_0$.
Naturally, every well-ordering from the hierarchy could be considered as a
constructive system of ordinal notations. In proof theory constructive systems
of ordinal notations with fixed systems of cofinal sequences are used for the
purposes of classification of provable recursive functions of theories. We show
that any well-ordering from the hierarchy could be extended by a monadically
definable system of cofinal sequences with Bachmann property. We show that the
growth speed of functions from fast-growing hierarchy based on constructive
ordinal notations from Caucal hierarchy may be only slightly influenced by the
choice of monadically definable systems of cofinal sequences. We show that for
ordinals less than $\omega^\omega$ a fast-growing hierarchy based on any system
of ordinal notations from Caucal hierarchy coincides with L\""ob-Wainer

these issues, and survey recent developments in this field of research.
Starting from the definition of cumulants, basic concepts in fluctuation

~120 degree wide opposing streams, almost triple the number previously known.
The vast majority of these ejecta knots lie at projected distances well out
ahead of the remnant's forward blast wave and main shell ejecta, extending to
angular distance of 320"" to the NE and 260"" to the SW from the center of
expansion. Such angular distances imply undecelerated ejecta knot transverse
velocities of 15,600 and 12,700 km/s respectively, assuming an explosion date
~1670 AD and a distance of 3.4 kpc. Optical spectra of knots near the outermost
tip of the NE ejecta stream show strong emission lines of S, Ca, and Ar. We
estimate a total mass ~0.1 Msun and a kinetic energy of at least ~1 x10^50 erg

kinetic energy argue against the Cas~A SN being a jet-induced explosion, the

of the nucleon momentum fraction carried by gluons, $x_{\rm g}$, covering the
range $0.04 \!<\! x_{ \rm g}\! <\! 0.28$~ and does not exhibit a significant

  Method","8pages",,,,"cs.CE cs.NE q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on experimental data is a
challenging task in bioinformatics. In this paper, we present a bi-objective
minimization model (BoMM) for inference of GRNs, where one objective is the
fitting error of derivatives, and the other is the number of connections in the
network. To solve the BoMM efficiently, we propose a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), and utilize the separable parameter estimation
method (SPEM) decoupling the ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Then,
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is employed to select one inference
result from the obtained Pareto set. Taking the S-system as the investigated
GRN model, our method can properly identify the topologies and parameter values
of benchmark systems. There is no need to preset problem-dependent parameter
values to obtain appropriate results, and thus, our method could be applicable
to inference of various GRNs models.

load-balancing networks with general service distributions. Specifically, we
consider a parallel server network that consists of N queues and operates under
the $SQ(d)$ load balancing policy, wherein jobs have independent and identical
service requirements and each incoming job is routed on arrival to the shortest
of $d$ queues that are sampled uniformly at random from $N$ queues. We
introduce a novel state representation and, for a large class of arrival
processes, including renewal and time-inhomogeneous Poisson arrivals, and mild
assumptions on the service distribution, show that the mean-field limit, as $N
\rightarrow \infty$, of the state can be characterized as the unique solution
of a sequence of coupled partial integro-differential equations, which we refer
to as the hydrodynamic PDE. We use a numerical scheme to solve the PDE to
obtain approximations to the dynamics of large networks and demonstrate the
efficacy of these approximations using Monte Carlo simulations. We also
illustrate how the PDE can be used to gain insight into network performance.

typically a full $n \times n$ kernel matrix is constructed over $n$ data

Techniques such as the Nystr\""om method and random feature maps can help

We then make a connection with dynamical systems theory. This leads to the set

requirements have been assessed, we propose a practical scheme to solve the
above class of problems based on the novel concept of self-organizing logic
gates and circuits (SOLCs). These are logic gates and circuits able to accept
input signals from any terminal, without distinction between conventional input

their solution. They can be fabricated either with circuit elements with memory
(such as memristors) and/or standard MOS technology. Using tools of functional
analysis, we prove mathematically the following constraints for the
poly-resource resolvability: i) SOLCs possess a global attractor; ii) their
only equilibrium points are the solutions of the problems to solve; iii) the
system converges exponentially fast to the solutions; iv) the equilibrium
convergence rate scales at most polynomially with input size. We finally
provide arguments that periodic orbits and strange attractors cannot coexist
with equilibria. As examples we show how to solve the prime factorization and
the NP-hard version of the subset-sum problem. Since DMMs map integers into
integers they are robust against noise, and hence scalable. We finally discuss

for massive or very large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
To extract essential information from the CSI without redundancy that arises
from the highly correlated antennas, a receiver transforms (sparsifies) a
correlated CSI vector to an uncorrelated sparse CSI vector by using a
Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) matrix that consists of the eigen vectors of
covariance matrix of CSI vector and feeds back the essential components of the
sparse CSI, i.e., a principal component analysis method. A transmitter then
recovers the original CSI through the inverse transformation of the feedback
vector. Herein, to obtain the covariance matrix at transceiver, we derive
analytically the covariance matrix of spatially correlated Rayleigh fading
channels based on its statistics including transmit antennas' and receive
antennas' correlation matrices, channel variance, and channel delay profile.
With the knowledge of the channel statistics, the transceiver can readily
obtain the covariance matrix and KLT matrix. Compression feedback error and
bit-error-rate performance of the proposed method are analyzed. Numerical
results verify that the proposed method is promising, which reduces
significantly the feedback overhead of the massive-MIMO systems with marginal
performance degradation from full-CSI feedback (e.g., feedback amount reduction
by 80%, i.e., 1/5 of original CSI, with spectral efficiency reduction by only
2%). Furthermore, we show numerically that, for a given limited feedback
amount, we can find the optimal number of transmit antennas to achieve the
largest spectral efficiency, which is a new design framework.

through the use of suitably modified versions of the standard divergence
measures. The relevant solutions to the minimum distance methods are referred
to as the minimum rescaled modified distance estimators (MRMDEs). Three
measures were considered - the likelihood disparity, the Hellinger distance and
Pearson's chi-square distance. The proposed approach is motivated by the
observation that, in the case of the likelihood disparity, when the empirical
distribution function is used to estimate g, it becomes equivalent to maximum
likelihood classification with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for speaker
classes, a highly effective approach used, for example, by Reynolds [22] based
on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as features. Significant
improvement in classification accuracy is observed under this approach on the

MFCC features, both in isolation and in combination with delta MFCC features.
Moreover, the ubiquitous principal component transformation, by itself and in
conjunction with the principle of classifier combination, is found to further
enhance the performance.

on addressing data management in IoT through using a smart data pricing (SDP)
approach. With SDP, data can be managed flexibly and efficiently through
intelligent and adaptive incentive mechanisms. Moreover, it is a major source
of revenue for providers and partners. We propose a new pricing scheme for IoT
service providers to determine the sensing data buying price and IoT service
subscription fee offered to sensor owners and service users, respectively.
Additionally, we adopt the bundling strategy that allows multiple providers to
form a coalition and bid their services as a bundle, attracting more users and
achieving higher revenue. Finally, we outline some important open research
issues for SDP and IoT.

converse part, we establish the $\varepsilon$-capacity and show that it depends
on $\varepsilon$ in general and so the strong converse fails to hold.
Furthermore, we provide bounds on the second-order term in the asymptotic
expansion. We show that for any positive integer $L$, the second-order term is
bounded between a term proportional to $-\ln_{(L)} n$ (where $\ln_{(L)}(\cdot)$
is the $L$-fold nested logarithm function) and a term proportional to
$+\sqrt{n\ln n}$ where $n$ is the blocklength. The lower bound on the
second-order term shows that feedback does provide an improvement in the
maximal achievable rate over the case where no feedback is available. In our
second contribution, we establish the $\varepsilon$-capacity region for the

model-independent ratios of lensing-potential derivatives derived in Wagner &
Bartelmann (2015). Models are selected by comparing these model-independent
ratios of potential derivatives to (numerically determined) ratios of potential
derivatives along critical curves for entire lens model families in a given
range of parameter values. This comparison returns parameter ranges which lens
model families can reproduce observation within, as well as sections of the
critical curve where image sets of the observed type can appear. If the
model-independent potential-derivative ratios inferred from the observation
fall outside the range of these ratios derived for the lens model family, the
entire family can be excluded as a feasible model in the given volume in
parameter space. We employ this approach for the family of singular isothermal
spheres with external shear to examples of lensing by a galaxy and two galaxy
clusters (JVAS B1422+231, SDSS J2222+2745, and MACS J1149.5+2223) and show that
the results obtained by our general method are in good agreement with results
of previous model fits.

Extinction and emission of dust models need for observational
constraints to be validated. The coreshine phenomenon has already shown the
importance of scattering in the 3 to 5 micron range and its ability to validate
dust properties for dense cores. Aims. We want to investigate whether
scattering can also play a role at longer wavelengths and to place even tighter
constraints on the dust properties. Methods. We analyze the inversion of the
Spitzer 8 micron map of the dense molecular cloud L183, to examine the
importance of scattering as a potential contributor to the line-of-sight
extinction. Results. The column density deduced from the inversion of the 8
micron map, when we neglect scattering, disagrees with all the other column
density measurements of the same region. Modeling confirms that scattering at 8
microns is not negligible with an intensity of several hundred kJy per sr. This
demonstrates the need of efficiently scattering dust grains at MIR wavelengths
up to 8 microns. Coagulated aggregates are good candidates and might also
explain the discrepancy at high extinction between E(J-K) et tau(9.7) toward
dense molecular clouds. Further investigation requires considering efficiently
scattering dust grains including ices as realistic dust models.

has been investigated via experiments and modeling. Two sets of experiments
have been implemented, in which pedestrians are asked to escape either in
individual or in couples. The experiments show that escaping in couples can
decrease the average evacuation time. Moreover, it is found that the average
evacuation time gap is essentially constant, which means that the evacuation
speed essentially does not depend on the number of pedestrians that have not
yet escaped. To model the evacuation dynamics, an improved social force model
has been proposed, in which it is assumed that the driving force of a
pedestrian cannot be fulfilled when the composition of physical forces exceeds
a threshold because the pedestrian cannot keep his/her body balance under this
circumstance. To model the effect of escaping in couples, attraction force has
been introduced between the partners. Simulation results are in good agreement
with the experimental ones.

spectacular manifestations of the solar activity. In such events nearby
energetic disturbances induce periodic motions on filaments with displacements
comparable to the size of the filaments themselves and with velocities larger
than 20 km/s. The pendulum model, in which the gravity projected along a rigid
magnetic field is the restoring force, was proposed to explain these events.
However, it can be objected that in a realistic situation where the magnetic
field reacts to the mass motion of the heavy prominence, the simplified
pendulum model could be no longer valid. We have performed non-linear
time-dependent numerical simulations of LALOs considering a dipped magnetic
field line structure. In this work we demonstrate that for even relatively weak

cosmological N-body simulations of the formation of Milky Way halos. In
particular, we have characterised the streams in angle/frequency spaces derived
using an approximate but generally well-fitting spherical potential. We have
also run several test-particle simulations to understand and guide our
interpretation of the different features we see in the Aquarius streams. Our
goal is both to establish which deviations of the expected action-angle
behaviour of streams exist because of the approximations made on the potential,
but also to derive to what degree we can use these coordinates to model streams
reliably.
  We have found that many of the Aquarius streams wrap in angle space along
relatively straight lines, and also in frequency space. On the other hand, from
our controlled simulations we have been able to establish that deviations from
spherical symmetry, the use of incorrect potentials and the inclusion of
self-gravity lead to streams in angle space to still be along relatively
straight lines but also to depict wiggly behaviour whose amplitude increases as
the approximation to the true potential becomes worse. In frequency space
streams typically become thicker and somewhat distorted. Therefore, our
analysis explains most of the features seen in the approximate angle and
frequency spaces for the Aquarius streams with the exception of their somewhat
`noisy' and `patchy' morphologies. These are likely due to the interactions
with the large number of dark matter subhalos present in the cosmological
simulations. Since the measured angle-frequency misalignments of the Aquarius
streams can largely be attributed to using the wrong (spherical) potential,
determining the mass growth history of these halos will only be feasible once
the true potential has been determined robustly.

  films",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spin-wave resonance (SWR) is a newly emerged method for studying surface
magnetic anisotropy and surface spin-wave modes (SSWMs) in (Ga,Mn)As thin
films. The existence of SSWMs in (Ga,Mn)As thin films has recently been
reported in the literature; SSWMs have been observed in the in-plane
configuration (with variable azimuth angle $\phi_M$ between the in-plane
magnetization of the film and the surface [100] crystal axis), in the azimuth
angle range between two in-plane critical angles $\phi_{c1}$ and $\phi_{c2}$.
We show here that cubic surface anisotropy is an essential factor determining
the existence conditions of the above-mentioned SSWMs: conditions favorable for
the occurrence of surface spin-wave modes in a (Ga,Mn)As thin film in the
in-plane configuration are fulfilled for those azimuth orientations of the
magnetization of the sample that lie around the hard axes of cubic magnetic
anisotropy. This implies that a hard cubic anisotropy axis can be regarded in
(Ga,Mn)As thin films as an easy axis for surface spin pinning.

it difficult to determine their temperature structure. IRIS is able to
spectrally resolve Fe xxi emission from cold chromospheric brightenings, so can
be used to infer the amount of Fe xxi emission in 131 channel. Aims: We use
observations of two small solar flares seen by IRIS and SDO to compare the EMs
deduced from the IRIS Fe xxi line and the AIA 131 channel to determine the
fraction of Fe xxi emission in flare kernels in the 131 channel of AIA.
Methods: Cotemporal and cospatial pseudo-raster AIA images are compared with
the IRIS results.We use multi-Gaussian line fitting to separate the blending
chromospheric emission so as to derive Fe xxi intensities and Doppler shifts in
IRIS spectra. Results: We define loop and kernel regions based on the
brightness of the 131 and 1600 {\AA} intensities. In the loop regions the Fe
xxi EMs are typically 80% of the 131 ones, and range from 67% to 92%. Much of
the scatter is due to small misalignments but the largest site with low Fe xxi
contributions was probably affected by a recent injection of cool plasma into
the loop. In flare kernels the contribution of Fe xxi increases from less than
10% at the low intensity 131 sites to 40-80% in the brighter kernels. Here the
Fe xxi is superimposed on bright chromospheric emission and the Fe xxi line
shows blue shifts, sometimes extending up to the edge of the spectral window,
200 km/s. Conclusions: The AIA 131 emission in flare loops is due to Fe xxi
emission with a 10-20% contribution from continuum, Fe xxiii, and cooler
background plasma emission. In bright flare kernels up to 52% of the 131 is
from cooler plasma. The wide range seen in the kernels is caused by significant
structure in the kernels which is seen as sharp gradients in Fe xxi EM at sites
of molecular and transition region emission.

in the higher photonic bands and, in particular, near the $\Gamma$-point. By
homogenization we mean introducing some effective local parameters
$\epsilon_{\rm eff}$ and $\mu_{\rm eff}$ that describe reflection, refraction
and propagation of electromagnetic waves in the PC adequately. The parameters
$\epsilon_{\rm eff}$ and $\mu_{\rm eff}$ can be associated with a hypothetical
homogeneous effective medium. In particular, if the PC is homogenizable, the
dispersion relations and isofrequency lines in the effective medium and in the
PC should coincide to some level of approximation. We can view this requirement
as a necessary condition of homogenizability. In the vicinity of a
$\Gamma$-point, real isofrequency lines of two-dimensional PCs can be close to
mathematical circles, just like in the case of isotropic homogeneous materials.
Thus, one may be tempted to conclude that introduction of an effective medium
is possible and, at least, the necessary condition of homogenizability holds in
this case. We, however, show that this conclusion is incorrect: complex
dispersion points must be included into consideration even in the case of
strictly non-absorbing materials. By analyzing the complex dispersion relations
and the corresponding isofrequency lines, we have found that two-dimensional
PCs with $C_4$ and $C_6$ symmetries are not homogenizable in the higher
photonic bands. We also draw a distinction between spurious $\Gamma$-point
frequencies that are due to Brillouin-zone folding of Bloch bands and ""true""
$\Gamma$-point frequencies that are due to multiple scattering. Understanding
of the physically different phenomena that lead to the appearance of spurious
and ""true"" $\Gamma$-point frequencies is important for the theory of
homogenization.

first observations of these gullies. However, the recent discovery of current
activity within gullies now suggests a paradigm shift where a contemporary CO2
ice-based and liquid water-free mechanism may form all gullies. Here we perform
a survey of near-infrared observations and construct time sequences of water
and CO2 ice formation and sublimation at active gully sites. We observe that
all major new erosive features such as channel development or lengthening
systematically occur where and, if applicable, when CO2 ice is observed or
probable. CO2 ice layers are however estimated to be only 1 mm to 1 cm thick
for low-latitude sites, which may have implication for potential formation
mechanisms. We also observe that part of current gully activity, notably the
formation of some new deposits, is poorly compatible with the presence of CO2
ice. In particular, all new bright deposits reported in the literature have a
low CO2 ice probability while water ice should be present at most sites. Our
results confirm that CO2 ice is a key factor controlling present-day channel
development on Mars and show that other mechanisms, potentially involving
sublimation or melting of water ice, are also contributing to current gully
activity.

fields have a weak dependence on mass ratio $m_i/m_e$, indicating electron
mediated physics. A scan in system size is performed at $m_i/m_e = 2000$,
showing agreement with previous results with $m_i/m_e = 25$. In addition, the
instability found at large system sizes is quantitatively demonstrated to be
the Weibel instability. Furthermore, magnetic and electric energy spectra at
scales below the electron Larmor radius are found to exhibit power law behavior
with spectral indices $-16/3$ and $-7/3$, respectively.

universe. An amount of gravitational energy of the order of the rest-mass
energy of the Sun is released from a small region, within seconds or longer.
This should lead to the formation of a fireball of temperature in the MeV
range, consisting of electrons/positrons, photons, and a small fraction of
baryons. We exploit the potential of GRB fireballs for being a laboratory for
testing particle physics beyond the Standard Model, where we find that
Weinberg's Higgs portal model serves as a good candidate for this purpose. Due
to the resonance effects, the Goldstone bosons can be rapidly produced by
electron-positron annihilation process in the initial fireballs of the
gamma-ray bursts. On the other hand, the mean free path of the Goldstone bosons
is larger than the size of the GRB initial fireballs, so they are not coupled
to the GRB's relativistic flow and can lead to significant energy loss. Using
generic values for the GRB initial fireball energy, temperature, radius,
expansion rate, and baryon number density, we find that the GRB bounds on the
parameters of Weinberg's Higgs portal model are indeed competitive to current
laboratory constraints.

distortion during transit (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect), we detect the
absorption of carbon monoxide and water vapor in the planet transmission

(7.6{\sigma}) for a planet rotational velocity of $(3.4^{+1.3}_{-2.1})$ km/s,

consistent with the planet orbital period of 2.2 days and therefore with tidal
locking. We find that the rotation of HD 189733 b is longer than 1 day

the unprecedentedly high flux for classical specular reflectometry combined
with off-specular reflectometry and grazing incidence small-angle scattering

physical contexts, like acoustics, plasma physics, hydrodynamics and nonlinear
optics. In 2+1 dimensions and with quadratic nonlinearity, this equation is
integrable through a novel IST, and it has been recently shown to be a
prototype model equation in the description of the two dimensional wave
breaking of localized initial data. In higher dimensions and with higher
nonlinearity, the generalized dKP equations are not integrable, but their
invariance under motions on the paraboloid allows one to construct in this
paper a family of exact solutions describing waves constant on their
paraboloidal wave front and breaking simultaneously in all points of it,
developing after breaking either multivaluedness or single valued discontinuous
shocks. Then such exact solutions are used to build the longtime behavior of
the solutions of the Cauchy problem, for small and localized initial data,
showing that wave breaking of small initial data takes place in the longtime
regime if and only if $m(n-1)\le 2$. At last, the analytic aspects of such a
wave breaking are investigated in detail in terms of the small initial data, in
both cases in which the solution becomes multivalued after breaking or it
develops a discontinuous shock. These results, contained in the 2012 master
thesis of one of the authors (FS), generalize those obtained by one of the

regroup into color singlet structures that are different from those determined

soft interactions of partons with the underlying event can change color
connections. If such an effect is at play in proton-proton collisions, it may
be expected to be enhanced in proton-nucleus collisions due to the higher color
charge density in the underlying event. Here, we provide a qualitative argument
that color recombination effects could lead to a multiplicity dependent
hardening of single inclusive hadron spectra that dies out very weakly with
increasing transverse momentum. We present results of a (conservative) model
implementation in the cluster hadronization model of the SHERPA event
generator. In this model, we find that color recombination effects harden
indeed the single inclusive hadron spectra without affecting the jet spectra,
but that this effect does not depend significantly on underlying event
activity. We explain this model feature and we argue why, in general, data on
proton-nucleus collisions can help to constrain hadronization models used in
proton-proton event generators.

challenges in analyzing such cooperative networks is how to establish efficient

novel capacity outer bounds are presented for the ICs with conferencing users.
Using the outer bounds, several new capacity results are proved for interesting
channels with unidirectional cooperation in strong and mixed interference
regimes. A fact is that the conferencing link (between receivers) may be
utilized to provide one receiver with information about its corresponding
signal or its non-corresponding signal (interference signal). As a remarkable
consequence, it is demonstrated that both strategies can be helpful to achieve
the capacity of the channel. Finally, for the case of Gaussian IC, it is
mathematically shown that our outer bound is strictly tighter than the previous
one derived by Wang and Tse.

atoms driven by spatially inhomogeneous laser fields, induced, for instance, by
plasmonic enhancement. It is well known that the laser intensity should to
exceed certain threshold in order to generate HHG, when noble gas atoms in
their ground state are used as an active medium. One way to enhance the
coherent light coming from a conventional laser oscillator is to take advantage
of the amplification obtained by the so-called surface plasmon polaritons,
created when a low intensity laser field is focused onto a metallic
nanostructure. The main limitation of this scheme is the low damage threshold
of the materials employed in the nanostructures engineering. In this work we
propose to use Rydberg atoms, driven by spatially inhomogeneous,
plasmonic-enhanced laser fields, for HHG. We exhaustively discuss the behaviour
and efficiency of these systems in the generation of coherent harmonic
emission. To this aim we numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger
equation for an atom with an electron initially in a highly excited $n$-th
Rydberg state, located in the vicinity of a metallic nanostructure, where the
electric field changes spatially on the scales relevant for the dynamics of the
laser-ionized electron. We first use a one-dimensional model to investigate the
phenomena systematically. We then employ a more realistic situation, when the
interaction of a plasmonic-enhanced laser field with a three-dimensional
Hydrogen atom is modelled. We discuss the scaling of the relevant input
parameters with the principal quantum number $n$ of the Rydberg state in
question, and demonstrate that harmonic emission could be achieved from Rydberg
atoms well below the damage threshold, thus without deteriorating the geometry
and properties of the metallic nanostructure.

interacting agents which compete for limited resources and reproduce in an
error prone fashion and at a rate depending on the `tangle' of interactions
they maintain with others.
  The set of interactions linking a TNM individual to others is key to its
reproductive success and arguably constitutes its most important property. Yet,
in many studies, the interactions of an individual and those of its mutated
off-spring are unrelated, a rather unrealistic feature corresponding to a point
mutation turning a giraffe into an elephant. To bring out the structural and
dynamical effects of trait inheritance , we introduce and numerically analyze a
family of TNM models where a positive integer $K$ parametrises correlations
between the interactions of an agent and those of its mutated offspring. For
$K=1$ a single point mutation randomizes all the interactions, while increasing
$K$ up to the length of the genome ensures an increasing level of trait
inheritance. We show that the distribution of the interactions generated by our
rule is nearly independent of the value of $K$. Changing $K$ strengthens the
core structure of the ecology, leads to population abundance distributions
which are better approximated by log-normal probability densities and increases
the probability that a species extant at time $t_{\rm w}$ is also extant at a
later time $t$. In particular, survival probabilities are shown to decay as
powers of the ratio $t/t_{\rm w}$, similarity to the pure aging behaviour
approximately describing glassy systems of physical origin. Increasing the
value of $K$ decreases the numerical value of the decay exponent of the power
law, which is a clear quantitative dynamical effect of trait inheritance.

epidemic thresholds, including the mean-field like (MFL) method, the quenched
mean-field (QMF) method, and the dynamical message passing (DMP) method. When
these methods are applied to predict epidemic threshold they often produce
differing results and their relative levels of accuracy are still unknown. We
systematically analyze these two issues---relationships among differing results
and levels of accuracy---by studying the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
model on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of 56 real-world
networks. In uncorrelated configuration networks the MFL and DMP methods yield
identical predictions that are larger and more accurate than the prediction
generated by the QMF method. When compared to the 56 real-world networks, the
epidemic threshold obtained by the DMP method is closer to the actual epidemic
threshold because it incorporates full network topology information and some
dynamical correlations. We find that in some scenarios---such as networks with
positive degree-degree correlations, with an eigenvector localized on the high
$k$-core nodes, or with a high level of clustering---the epidemic threshold
predicted by the MFL method, which uses the degree distribution as the only
input parameter, performs better than the other two methods. We also find that
the performances of the three predictions are irregular versus modularity.

the highly successful density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm,
and the quantum chemical graphical representation of configuration space, we
introduce a new theoretical tool: Hilbert space renormalization, to describe
many-electron correlations. While in DMRG, the many-body states in nested Fock
subspaces are successively renormalized, in Hilbert space renormalization,
many-body states in nested Hilbert subspaces undergo renormalization. This
provides a new way to classify and combine configurations. The underlying
wavefunction ansatz, namely the Hilbert space matrix product state (HS-MPS),
has a very rich and flexible mathematical structure. It provides low-rank
tensor approximations to any configuration interaction (CI) space through
restricting either the 'physical indices' or the coupling rules in the HS-MPS.
Alternatively, simply truncating the 'virtual dimension' of the HS-MPS leads to
a family of size-extensive wave function ansaetze that can be used efficiently
in variational calculations. We make formal and numerical comparisons between
the HS-MPS, the traditional Fock-space MPS used in DMRG, and traditional CI
approximations. The analysis and results shed light on fundamental aspects of
the efficient representation of many-electron wavefunctions through the
renormalization of many-body states.

interface trials are interspersed with movements in both the subjects' real
hands, which are in view throughout the experiment. We show that subjects
develop strong feelings of ownership and control over the third hand, despite
only receiving visual feedback with no causal link to the actual brain signals.
Our illusion is crucially different from previously reported studies as we
demonstrate independent ownership and control of the third hand without loss of
ownership in the real hands.

determine the lifetime of an eta' meson being at rest in a strongly interacting
medium as a function of the temperature. To have a formally well-defined
low-energy limit we use in a first step Chiral Perturbation Theory for a large
number of colors. We determine the pertinent scattering amplitudes in leading

in the same mass range as the eta' meson. The resonances are introduced such
that the low-energy limit remains unchanged and that they saturate the
corresponding low-energy constants. This requirement fixes all coupling
constants. We find that the width of the eta' meson is significantly increased
from about 200 keV in vacuum to about 10 MeV at a temperature of 120 MeV.

their bent structure, i.e. that the protons give up their rigid angular
correlation and behave largely uncorrelated, similar to electrons in the
ground-state of helium? In agreement with the two-state picture of liquid water
this would allow for the thermal coexistence of tetraedrically coordinated and
spherical water molecules in the liquid. In the Hooke-Calogero model of a
confined triatomic of XY2-type it is shown that energetically low-lying zero
orbital-momentum states, which are bent if unconfined can change to helium-like
shape under increasing confinement strength f. For the respective states this
occurs at different values for f. It turns out that at f = 2.79 a bent and a
helium-like state can thermally coexist. In order to characterize more
precisely 'helium-like' angular correlation a maximum entropy estimate for the
marginal correlation of electrons in the helium ground state is given.

formation of multiple coherent condensates associated with the many subbands of

induced by the chemical potential tuned close to a subband bottom, in
correspondence of a superconducting shape resonance. The evolution of the
condensate fraction and of the pair correlation length in the ground state as
functions of the chemical potential demonstrates the tunability of the BCS-BEC
crossover for the condensate component of the selected subband. The extension
of the crossover regime increases when the pairing strength and/or the

forces, myocardial activity, morphogen gradients, and epigenetic signaling, all
of which are coupled with genetic regulatory networks. Recently both in vivo
and in silico studies have tried to better understand hemodynamics at varying
stages of vertebrate cardiogenesis. In particular, the intracardial
hemodynamics during the onset of trabeculation is notably complex - the
inertial and viscous fluid forces are approximately equal at this stage and
small perturbations in morphology, scale, and steadiness of the flow can lead
to significant changes in bulk flow structures, shear stress distributions, and
chemical morphogen gradients. The immersed boundary method was used to solve
the computational fluid dynamics problem involving fluid flow moving through
the trabeculated ventricles of 72, 80, and 120 hours post fertilization wild
type zebrafish embryos and ErbB2-inhibited embryos at 7 days post
fertilization. An idealized trabeculated ventricular model was explored to map
the bifurcations in flow structure that occur as a result of the unsteadiness
of flow, trabeculae height, and fluid scale ($Re$). Vortex formation occurred
in intertrabecular regions for biologically relevant parameter spaces, wherein
flow velocities increased. This indicates that trabecular morphology may alter
intracardial flow patterns and hence ventricular shear stresses and morphogen
gradients. A potential implication of this work is that the onset of vortical
(disturbed) flows can upregulate Notch1 expression in endothelial cells in
vitro and hence impacts chamber morphogensis, valvulogenesis, and the formation
of the trabeculae themselves.
