that applies the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to model human
decision-making. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations of the
quantum approach to cognition that we developed in Brussels. These foundations
rest on the results of two decade studies on the axiomatic and
operational-realistic approaches to the foundations of quantum physics. The
deep analogies between the foundations of physics and cognition lead us to
investigate the validity of quantum theory as a general and unitary framework
for cognitive processes, and the empirical success of the Hilbert space models
derived by such investigation provides a strong theoretical confirmation of
this validity. However, two situations in the cognitive realm, 'question order
effects' and 'response replicability', indicate that even the Hilbert space
framework could be insufficient to reproduce the collected data. This does not
mean that the mentioned operational-realistic approach would be incorrect, but
simply that a larger class of measurements would be in force in human
cognition, so that an extended quantum formalism may be needed to deal with all
of them. As we will explain, the recently derived 'extended Bloch
representation' of quantum theory (and the associated 'general
tension-reduction' model) precisely provides such extended formalism, while
remaining within the same unitary interpretative framework.

impose its point of view to as many social agents as it can. We model this by
making the Media has a fixed feature, representing its point of view in the

advantage of feedback mechanisms, represented by adaptive features. We explore
different strategies that the Media can adopt in order to increase the affinity
with potential consumers and then the probability to be successful in imposing

suppressed superconductivity which have attracted much attention for electronic
applications, new sources of THz radiation, and low-dissipative computing. Our
numerical simulations show that a rapidly moving vortex driven by a constant
current becomes unstable with respect to generation of vortex-antivortex pairs
caused by Cherenkov radiation. As a result, vortices and antivortices become
spatially separated and accumulate continuously on the opposite sides of an
expanding dissipative domain. This effect is most pronounced in thin film edge
Josephson junctions at low temperatures where a single vortex can switch the
whole junction into a resistive state at currents well below the Josephson
critical current. Our work gives a new insight into instability of a moving
topological defect which destroys global long-range order in a way that is
remarkably similar to the crack propagation in solids.

exactly isostatic with high fidelity over a large range of plane separation

relative concentration $x$. We find that packing characteristics can be
substantially different from their bulk analogs, which is due to what we term
""confinement frustration"". Rattlers in confined packings are generally more
prevalent than those in their bulk counterparts. We observe that packing
fraction, rattler fraction and degree of disorder of MRJ packings generally
increase with $H$, though exceptions exist. Discontinuities in the packing
characteristics as $H$ varies in the vicinity of certain values of $H$ are due
to associated discontinuous transitions between different jammed states. We
also apply the local volume-fraction variance $\sigma_{\tau}^2(R)$ to
characterize confined packings and find that these packings possess essentially
the same level of hyperuniformity as their bulk counterparts. Our findings are
generally relevant to confined packings that arise in biology (e.g., structural

momentum broadening due to medium interactions and interference effects between

interplay between the transverse scale of the hard probe and the transverse

Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations driven by

coupling operators on the system variables is represented using the Weyl
functional calculus. This leads to an integro-differential equation (IDE) for
the evolution of the quasi-characteristic function (QCF) which encodes the
dynamics of mixed moments of the system variables. Unlike quantum master
equations for reduced density operators, this IDE involves only complex-valued
functions on finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and extends the Wigner-Moyal
phase-space approach for quantum stochastic systems. The dynamics of the QCF
and the related Wigner quasi-probability density function (QPDF) are discussed
in more detail for the case when the coupling operators depend linearly on the
system variables and the Hamiltonian has a nonquadratic part represented in the
Weyl quantization form. For this class of quantum stochastic systems, we also
consider an approximate computation of invariant states and discuss the
deviation from Gaussian quantum states in terms of the $\chi^2$-divergence (or
the second-order Renyi relative entropy) applied to the QPDF. The results of
the paper may find applications to investigating different aspects of the

there have been no detections of dust in these structures. A key problem in
this search is the removal of foreground dust emission. Using the
Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey and the Planck far-infrared data, we investigate a
bright, cold, and clumpy HVC. This cloud apparently undergoes an interaction
with the ambient medium and thus has great potential to form dust. To remove
the local foreground dust emission we used a regularised, generalised linear
model and we show the advantages of this approach with respect to other
methods. To estimate the dust emissivity of the HVC, we set up a simple
Bayesian model with mildly informative priors to perform the line fit instead
of an ordinary linear least-squares approach. We find that the foreground can
be modelled accurately and robustly with our approach and is limited mostly by
the cosmic infrared background. Despite this improvement, we did not detect any
significant dust emission from this promising HVC. The 3-sigma upper limit to
the dust emissivity is an order of magnitude below the typical values for the
Galactic interstellar medium.

species by shear-induced turbulence in strongly stratified but thermally
diffusive environments. The shear instabilities driven in this regime are
sometimes called ""secular"" shear instabilities, and can take place even when
the gradient Richardson number of the flow (the square of the ratio of the
buoyancy frequency to the shearing rate) is large, provided the P\'eclet number
(the ratio of the thermal diffusion timescale to the turnover timescale of the
turbulent eddies) is small. We have identified a set of simple criteria to
determine whether these instabilities can take place or not. Generally
speaking, we find that they may be relevant whenever the thermal diffusivity of
the fluid is very large (typically larger than $10^{14}$cm$^2$/s), which is the
case in the outer layers of high-mass stars ($M\ge 10 M_\odot$) for instance.
Using a simple model setup in which the shear is forced by a spatially
sinusoidal, constant-amplitude body-force, we have identified several regimes
ranging from effectively unstratified to very strongly stratified, each with
its own set of dynamical properties. Unless the system is in one of the two
extreme regimes (effectively unstratified or completely stable), however, we
find that (1) only about 10% of the input power is used towards heat transport,
while the remaining 90% is viscously dissipated; (2) that the effective
compositional mixing coefficient is well-approximated by the model of Zahn
(1992), with $D \simeq 0.02 \kappa_T /J$ where $\kappa_T$ is the thermal
diffusivity and $J$ is the gradient Richardson number. These results need to be
confirmed, however, with simulations in different model setups and at higher
effective Reynolds number.

of anthropogenic climate change. However, it is intrinsically difficult to
estimate changes in extreme events from the short observational record. In this
work we use millennial runs from the CCSM3 in equilibrated pre-industrial and
possible future conditions to examine both how extremes change in this model
and how well these changes can be estimated as a function of run length. We
estimate changes to distributions of future temperature extremes (annual minima
and annual maxima) in the contiguous United States by fitting generalized
extreme value (GEV) distributions. Using 1000-year pre-industrial and future
time series, we show that the magnitude of warm extremes largely shifts in
accordance with mean shifts in summertime temperatures. In contrast, cold
extremes warm more than mean shifts in wintertime temperatures, but changes in
GEV location parameters are largely explainable by mean shifts combined with
reduced wintertime temperature variability. In addition, changes in the spread
and shape of the GEV distributions of cold extremes at inland locations can
lead to discernible changes in tail behavior. We then examine uncertainties
that result from using shorter model runs. In principle, the GEV distribution
provides theoretical justification to predict infrequent events using time
series shorter than the recurrence frequency of those events. To investigate
how well this approach works in practice, we estimate 20-, 50-, and 100-year
extreme events using segments of varying lengths. We find that even using GEV
distributions, time series that are of comparable or shorter length than the
return period of interest can lead to very poor estimates. These results
suggest caution when attempting to use short observational time series or model
runs to infer infrequent extremes.

this paper, we propose by far the most robust and ideal Weyl semimetal
candidate in the inversion breaking, single crystalline compound tantalum
sulfide Ta$_3$S$_2$ with new and novel properties beyond TaAs. We find that
Ta$_3$S$_2$ has only 8 Weyl nodes, all of which have the same energy that is
merely 10 meV below the chemical potential. Crucially, our results show that
Ta$_3$S$_2$ has the largest $k$-space separation between Weyl nodes among known
Weyl semimetal candidates, which is about twice larger than TaAs and twenty
times larger than the predicted value in WTe$_2$. Moreover, we predict that
increasing the lattice by $<4\%$ can annihilate all Weyl nodes, driving a novel
topological metal-to-insulator transition from a Weyl semimetal state to a
topological insulator state. We further discover that changing the lattice
constant can move the Weyl nodes and the van Hove singularities with enhanced
density of states to the chemical potential. Our prediction provides a
critically needed robust candidate for this rapidly developing field. The well
separated Weyl nodes, the topological metal-to-insulator transition and the
remarkable tunabilities suggest Ta$_3$S$_2$'s potential as the ideal platform
in future device-applications based on Weyl semimetals.

This paper addresses the challenge of matrix completion in the face of such

applying a Lipschitz, monotonic function to a low rank matrix, our task is to
estimate the remaining unobserved entries. We propose a novel matrix completion
method that alternates between low-rank matrix estimation and monotonic
function estimation to estimate the missing matrix elements. Mean squared error
bounds provide insight into how well the matrix can be estimated based on the

radiation pressure (RP) feedback from young stars. While RP has little effect
on the sizes and global stability of discs, it reduces the amount of
star-forming gas by a factor of ~2, leading to a decrease in stellar mass by a
similar factor by z~2. Both samples undergo violent disc instability (VDI) and
form giant clumps of masses 10^7-10^9M_s at a similar rate, though RP
significantly reduces the number of long-lived clumps. When RP is (not)
included, clumps with circular velocity <40(20)km/s, baryonic surface density
<200(100)M_s/pc^2 and baryonic mass <10^{8.2}(10^{7.3})M_s are short-lived,
disrupted in a few free-fall times. The more massive and dense clumps survive
and migrate toward the disc centre over a few disc orbital times. In the RP
simulations, the distribution of clump masses and star-formation rates (SFRs)
normalized to their host disc is very similar at all redshifts. They exhibit a
truncated power-law with a slope slightly shallower than -2. Short-lived clumps
preferentially have young stellar ages, low masses, high gas fractions and
specific SFRs (sSFR), and they tend to populate the outer disc. The sSFR of
massive, long-lived clumps declines with age as they migrate towards the disc
centre, producing gradients in mass, stellar age, gas fraction, sSFR and
metallicity that distinguish them from short-lived clumps. Ex situ mergers make
up ~37% of the mass in clumps and ~29% of the SFR. They are more massive and
with older stellar ages than the in situ clumps, especially near the disc edge.
Roughly half the galaxies at redshifts z=4-1 are clumpy over a wide range of
stellar mass, with clumps accounting for ~3-30% of the SFR but ~0.1-3% of the
stellar mass.

ratio L_B/L_A = 0.68--0.94, and an orbital period P_orb = 4.433d. The
photometric data allowed us to measure the rotation periods of the two
components P_phot = 4.4351d and they are found to be synchronized with the
orbital period. The simultaneous modeling of V-, I-band, and radial velocity
curves in the 2005 season suggests that the variability is dominated by one hot
spot on the secondary component covering at least about 3.5% of the stellar
surface and about 420K hotter than the unperturbed photosphere. Such a spot may
originate from the material of the circumbinary disc accreting onto the
secondary component. We also detect an apparent 6-yr periodic variation in the
position of this hot spot, which is inferred from the phase migration of the
light curve maximum, which we interpret as due to either the presence of
surface differential rotation as large as 0.065%, a value compatible with the
fully convective components, or to a periodic exchange of angular momentum
between the disc and the star, which implies a minimum magnetic field strength
of 650G at the stellar surface.

large-scale inference. Using extreme-value form statistics to test against
sparse alternatives and using quadratic form statistics to test against dense
alternatives are two important testing procedures for high-dimensional
independence. However, quadratic form statistics suffer from low power against
sparse alternatives, and extreme-value form statistics suffer from low power
against dense alternatives with small disturbances and may have size
distortions due to its slow convergence. For real-world applications, it is
important to derive powerful testing procedures against more general
alternatives. Based on intermediate limiting distributions, we derive
(model-free) joint limiting laws of extreme-value form and quadratic form
statistics, and surprisingly, we prove that they are asymptotically
independent. Given such asymptotic independencies, we propose (model-free)
testing procedures to boost the power against general alternatives and also
retain the correct asymptotic size. Under the high-dimensional setting, we
derive the closed-form limiting null distributions, and obtain their explicit
rates of uniform convergence. We prove their consistent statistical powers
against general alternatives. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed
test statistics in simulation studies. Our work provides very helpful insights

world-sheet action. A peculiarity of such a model is the loss of the local
Lorentz invariance which is required to be recovered on-shell. This dictates a
constraint on the backgrounds which characterizes the double geometry of the
target space. Constant and non-constant backgrounds are considered. In the
former case, the local Lorentz constraint implies the geometry of a double

engendered by compacton-like kinks, the so-called hybrid branes. In such
scenarios, the thin brane behaviour is manifested when the extra dimension is
outside the compact domain, where the energy density is non-trivial, instead of
asymptotically as in the usual thick brane models. The zero mode is trapped in
the brane, as required. The massive modes, although are not localized in the
brane, have important phenomenological implications such as corrections to the
Newton's law. We study such corrections in the usual thick domain wall and in
the hybrid brane scenarios. By means of suitable numerical methods, we attain
the mass spectrum for the graviton and the corresponding wavefunctions. The
spectra possess the usual linearly increasing behaviour from the Kaluza-Klein
theories. Further, we show that the 4D gravitational force is slightly
increased at short distances. The first eigenstate contributes highly for the
correction to the Newton's law. The subsequent normalized solutions have
diminishing contributions. Moreover, we find out that the phenomenology of the
hybrid brane is not different from the usual thick domain wall. The use of
numerical techniques for solving the equations of the massive modes is useful
for matching possible phenomenological measurements in the gravitational law as
a probe to warped extra dimensions.

The STM signatures for various defects in epitaxial silicene on Ag(111) surface

superstructures, which, in turn, may have implications for controlling the

the mystery of the defective appearance of v13*v13 silicene in experiments is

captures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general
lower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under
computational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and
combinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the
classical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify
the optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational
budgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply
characterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing
problems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component
detection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures,
namely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify
significant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable
under computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical
lower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for
statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on
Turing machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like
planted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which
covers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven
hypotheses. Moreover, our result provides an intuitive and concrete
interpretation for the intrinsic computational intractability of
high-dimensional statistical problems. One byproduct of our result is a lower

Edmonds, Lov\'asz, and Pulleyblank introduced the so-called {\em Tight Cut
Lemma} as the most challenging aspect of their work. The Tight Cut Lemma in
fact claims {\em bricks} as the fundamental building blocks that constitute a
graph in studying the matching polytope and can be referred to as a key result
in this field. Even though the Tight Cut Lemma is a matching
\textup{(}$1$-matching\textup{)} theoretic statement that consists of purely
graph theoretic concepts, the known proofs either employ a linear programming
argument or are established upon results regarding a substantially wider notion
than matchings. This paper presents a new proof of the Tight Cut Lemma, which
attains both of the two reasonable features for the first time, namely, being
{\em purely graph theoretic} as well as {\em purely matching theory closed}.
Our proof uses, as the only preliminary result, the canonical decomposition
recently introduced by Kita. By further developing this canonical
decomposition, we acquire a new device of {\em towers} to analyze the structure
of bricks, and thus prove the Tight Cut Lemma. We believe that our new proof of
the Tight Cut Lemma provides a highly versatile example of how to handle
bricks.

QSDPNAL, for solving convex quadratic semidefinite programming (QSDP) problems
with constraints consisting of a large number of linear equality, inequality
constraints, a simple convex polyhedral set constraint, and a positive
semidefinite cone constraint. A first order algorithm which relies on the
inexact Schur complement based decomposition technique is developed in
QSDPNAL-Phase I with the aim of solving a QSDP problem to moderate accuracy or
using it to generate a reasonably good initial point for the second phase. In
QSDPNAL-Phase II, we design an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) where the
inner subproblem in each iteration is solved via inexact semismooth Newton
based algorithms. Simple and implementable stopping criteria are designed for
the ALM. Moreover, under mild conditions, we are able to establish the rate of
convergence of the proposed algorithm and prove the R-(super)linear convergence
of the KKT residual. In the implementation of QSDPNAL, we also develop
efficient techniques for solving large scale linear systems of equations under
certain subspace constraints. More specifically, simpler and yet better
conditioned linear systems are carefully designed to replace the original
linear systems and novel shadow sequences are constructed to alleviate the
numerical difficulties brought about by the crucial subspace constraints.
Extensive numerical results for various large scale QSDPs show that our
two-phase algorithm is highly efficient and robust in obtaining accurate
solutions.

presence of orbital resonances with the rate of icy asteroids crossing the
habitable zone (HZ), from a circumprimary disk of planetesimals in various
binary star systems. We modelled a belt of small bodies in the inner and outer
regions, interior and exterior to the orbit of a gas giant planet,
respectively. The planetesimals are equally placed around a primary G-type star
and move under the gravitational influence of the two stars and the gas giant.
We numerically integrated the system for 50 Myr, considering various parameters
for the secondary star. Its stellar type varies from a M- to F-type; its
semimajor axis is either 50 au or 100 au, and its eccentricity is either 0.1 or
0.3. For comparison, we also varied the gas giant's orbital and physical
parameters. Our simulations highlight that a disk of planetesimals will suffer
from perturbations owing to a perturbed gas giant, mean motion, and secular
resonances. We show that a secular resonance -- with location and width varying
according to the secondary star's characteristics -- can exist in the icy
asteroid belt region and overlap with MMRs which have an impact on the
dynamical lifetime of the disk. In addition, we point out that in any case, the
2:1 MMR, the 5:3 MMR and the secular resonance are powerful perturbations for

commonly stated in protocol specifications that sequence numbers are sufficient
to guarantee loop freedom if they are monotonically increased over time. A
classical example for the use of sequence numbers is the popular Ad hoc

magnetic catalysis prevails in strong coupling region regardless of the

the consequence of the competition between the dimensional reduction by Landau

understanding astrophysical (in particular, accretion) disks: whether the disk
interiors may be effectively viscous in spite of the absence of
marnetorotational instability? In this case a rotational homogeneous inviscid
flow with a Keplerian angular velocity profile is spectrally stable, making the
transient growth of perturbations a candidate mechanism for energy transfer
from the regular motion to perturbations. Transient perturbations differ
qualitatively from perturbation modes and can grow substantially in shear flows
due to the nonnormality of their dynamical evolution operator. Since the
eigenvectors of this operator, alias perturbation modes, are mutually
nonorthogonal, they can mutually interfere, resulting in the transient growth
of their linear combinations. Physically, a growing transient perturbation is a
leading spiral whose branches are shrunk as a result of the differential
rotation of the flow. This paper discusses in detail the transient growth of
vortex shear harmonics in the spatially local limit as well as methods for
identifying the optimal (fastest growth) perturbations. Special attention is
given to obtaining such solutions variationally, by integrating the direct and
adjoint equations forward and backward in time, respectively. The material is

galactic nuclei (AGNs) show blueshifts of a few hundred km/s to several
thousand km/sec with respect to the low-ionization lines. This has long been
thought to be due to the high-ionization lines of the BLR arising in a wind of
which the far side of the outflow is blocked from our view by the accretion
disc. Evidence for and against the disc-wind model is discussed. The biggest
problem for the model is that velocity-resolved reverberation mapping
repeatedly fails to show the expected kinematic signature of outflow of the
BLR. The disc-wind model also cannot readily reproduce the red side of the line
profiles of high-ionization lines. The rapidly falling density in an outflow
makes it difficult to obtain high equivalent widths. We point out a number of
major problems with associating the BLR with the outflows producing broad
absorption lines. An explanation which avoids all these problems and satisfies
the constraints of both the line profiles and velocity-resolved
reverberation-mapping is a model in which the blueshifting is due to scattering
off material spiraling inwards with an inflow velocity of half the velocity of
the blueshifting. We discuss how recent reverberation mapping results are
consistent with the scattering-plus-inflow model but do not support a disc-wind
model. We propose that the anti-correlation of the apparent redshifting of
H$\beta$ with the blueshifting of CIV is a consequence of contamination of the
red wings of H$\beta$ by the broad wings of [O III].

Exact solutions can be obtained for the homogeneous case using the Bethe ansatz
and bosonisation techniques. However, these approaches are not applicable when
external confinement is present. Recent theoretical advances beyond the Bethe
ansatz and bosonisation allow us to predict the behaviour of one-dimensional
confined systems with strong short-range interactions, and new experiments with
cold atomic Fermi gases have already confirmed these theories. Here we
demonstrate that a simple linear combination of the strongly interacting
solution with the well-known solution in the limit of vanishing interactions
provides a simple and accurate description of the system for all values of the
interaction strength. This indicates that one can indeed capture the physics of
confined one-dimensional systems by knowledge of the limits using wave
functions that are much easier to handle than the output of typical numerical
approaches. We demonstrate our scheme for experimentally relevant systems with
up to six particles. Moreover, we show that our method works also in the case
of mixed systems of particles with different masses. This is an important
feature because these systems are known to be non-integrable and thus not
solvable by the Bethe ansatz technique.

  Methods. The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation was applied to the
equations governing adiabatic small perturbations about a model of a uniformly
rotating barotropic star.
  Results. A general eikonal equation, including the effect of the centrifugal
deformation, is derived. The dynamics of axisymmetric gravito-inertial rays is
solved numerically for polytropic stellar models of increasing rotation and
analysed by describing the structure of the phase space. Three different types
of phase-space structures are distinguished. The first type results from the
continuous evolution of structures of the non-rotating integrable phase space.
It is predominant in the low-frequency part of the phase space. The second type
of structures are island chains associated with stable periodic rays. The third
type of structures are large chaotic regions that can be related to the
envelope minimum of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency.
  Conclusions. Gravito-inertial modes are expected to follow this
classification, in which the frequency spectrum is a superposition of
sub-spectra associated with these different types of phase-space structures.
The detailed confrontation between the predictions of this ray-based asymptotic
theory and numerically computed modes will be presented in a companion paper.

slightly deleterious mutations are fixed by random drift, and evolutionary rate
is determined primarily by the proportion of neutral mutations. However, recent
studies have revealed that highly expressed genes evolve slowly because of
fitness costs due to misfolded proteins. Here we study selection maintaining
protein stability.
  Protein fitness is taken to be $s = \kappa \exp(\beta\Delta G) (1 -
\exp(\beta\Delta\Delta G))$, where $s$ and $\Delta\Delta G$ are selective
advantage and stability change of a mutant protein, $\Delta G$ is the folding
free energy of the wild-type protein, and $\kappa$ represents protein abundance
and indispensability. The distribution of $\Delta\Delta G$ is approximated to
be a bi-Gaussian function, which represents structurally slightly- or
highly-constrained sites. Also, the mean of the distribution is negatively
proportional to $\Delta G$.
  The evolution of this gene has an equilibrium ($\Delta G_e$) of protein
stability, the range of which is consistent with experimental values. The
probability distribution of $K_a/K_s$, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
substitution rate per site, over fixed mutants in the vicinity of the
equilibrium shows that nearly neutral selection is predominant only in
low-abundant, non-essential proteins of $\Delta G_e > -2.5$ kcal/mol. In the
other proteins, positive selection on stabilizing mutations is significant to
maintain protein stability at equilibrium as well as random drift on slightly
negative mutations, although the average $\langle K_a/K_s \rangle$ is less than
1. Slow evolutionary rates can be caused by high protein
abundance/indispensability, which produces positive shifts of $\Delta\Delta G$
through decreasing $\Delta G_e$, and by strong structural constraints, which
directly make $\Delta\Delta G$ more positive.

quantum transport calculations, we herein show that the donor-acceptor

by introducing a bipolar P codopant atom into the energetically most favorable
nearest neighbor edge sites. The n-type (p-type) transport properties of B,P
(N,P) co-doped aGNRs are also shown to be superior to those of reference single
N (B) doped aGNRs in that the valence (conduction) band edge conductance
spectra are better preserved. Disentangling the chemical doping and structural
distortion effects, we will demonstrate that the latter plays an important role
in determining the transport type and explains the donor-acceptor transition
feature as well as the bipolar character of P-doped aGNRs. We thus propose the
systematic modification of GNR edge atomic structures via co-doping as a novel
approach to control charge transport characteristics of aGNRs.

System Barycentre, presumably, towards the Galactic centre. We review some
other less-well-known effects that are not part of standard astrometric models.
We model quasars and galaxies using realistic sky distributions, magnitudes and
redshifts. Position variability is introduced using a Markov chain model. The
reference frame is determined using the algorithm developed for the Gaia
mission which also determines the acceleration of the Solar System. We also
test a method to measure the velocity of the Solar System barycentre in a
cosmological frame. We simulate the recovery of the reference frame and the
acceleration of the Solar System and conclude that they are not significantly
disturbed in the presence of quasar variability which is statistically
averaged. However, the effect of a non-uniform sky distribution of the quasars
can result in a correlation between the reference frame and acceleration which
degrades the solution. Our results suggest that an attempt should be made to
astrometrically determine the redshift dependent apparent drift of galaxies due
to our velocity relative to the CMB, which in principle could allow the

closely-occurring multiband electronic (Mott) and structural (Peierls)

technological interests. Among the many techniques used to study VO2, the most
frequently used involve electromagnetic radiation as a probe. Understanding of
the distinct physical information provided by different probing radiations is
incomplete, mostly owing to the complicated nature of the phase transitions.
Here we use transmission of spatially averaged infrared ({\lambda}=1500 nm) and
visible ({\lambda}=500 nm) radiations followed by spectroscopy and nanoscale
imaging using x-rays ({\lambda}=2.25-2.38 nm) to probe the same VO2 sample
while controlling the ambient temperature across its hysteretic phase
transitions and monitoring its electrical resistance. We directly observed
nanoscale puddles of distinct electronic and structural compositions during the
transition. The two main results are that, during both heating and cooling, the
transition of infrared and visible transmission occur at significantly lower
temperatures than the Mott transition; and the electronic (Mott) transition
occurs before the structural (Peierls) transition in temperature. We use our
data to provide insights into possible microphysical origins of the different
transition characteristics. We highlight that it is important to understand
these effects because small changes in the nature of the probe can yield
quantitatively, and even qualitatively, different results when applied to a
non-trivial multiband phase transition. Our results guide more judicious use of
probe type and interpretation of the resulting data.

Assuming that Higgs couplings with the eletroweak gauge bosons are as in the

CP-violating Higgs-top quark anomalous couplings alone may drive the a strongly
first-order phase transition. The distinguished feature of this transition is
that the anomalous Higgs vacuum expectation value is generally non-zero in both
phases. We identify a range of anomalous couplings, consistent with current
experimental data, where sphaleron rates are sufficiently fast in the
'symmetric' phase and are suppressed in the 'broken' phase and demonstrate that
the desired baryon asymmetry can indeed be generated in this framework. This
range of the Higgs anomalous couplings can be further constrained from the LHC

without defects, are associated with the L^2 kernel of certain Dirac operators

vevs. We conjecture a map between these vevs and the Seiberg-Witten special

map incorporates all perturbative and nonperturbative corrections that are
relevant for the semiclassical construction of BPS states, over a suitably
defined weak coupling regime of the Coulomb branch. We use this map to
translate wall crossing formulae and the no-exotics theorem to statements about
the Dirac/Dolbeault operators. The no-exotics theorem, concerning the absence
of nontrivial SU(2)_R representations in the BPS spectrum, implies that the
kernel of the Dirac operator is chiral, and further translates into a statement
that all L^2 cohomology of the Dolbeault operator is concentrated in the middle
degree. Wall crossing formulae lead to detailed predictions for where the Dirac
operators fail to be Fredholm and how their kernels jump. We explore these
predictions in nontrivial examples. This paper explains the background and

the generalized Kelvin equation locating capillary condensation very
accurately, provided both walls are only partially wet. If at least one of the
walls is in complete wetting regime, the Kelvin equation should be modified by
capturing the effect of thick wetting films by including Derjaguin's

competing walls, so that one tends to be wet and the other dry. In this case,
an interface localized-delocalized transition occurs at bulk two-phase
coexistence and a temperature $T^*(L)$ depending on the pore width $L$. A
mean-field analysis shows that for walls exhibiting first-order wetting
transition at a temperature $T_{w}$, $T_{s}>T^*(L)>T_{w}$, where the spinodal
temperature $T_{s}$ can be associated with the prewetting critical point, which
also determines a critical pore width below which the interface
localized-delocalized transition does not occur. If the walls exhibit critical
wetting, the transition is shifted below $T_{w}$ and for a model with the
binding potential $W(\ell)=A(T)\ell^{-2}+B(T)\ell^{-3}+\cdots$, where $\ell$ is
the location of the liquid-gas interface, the transition can be characterized

generally dominant, while that from bubble collisions is the least significant

immunodeficiency seem to be related to each other through the subtle links
connecting retroviral mutation and action to immune response and adaptation. In
a previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated
genotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of
interrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does
not cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study
of quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the
conclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by
itself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of
the quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by
the addition of a further parameter ($\nu$) to account for the action of
retroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give
simulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues
of quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the
appearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to
how $\nu$ and $\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get
stimulated, relate to each other. While for $\nu>\lambda$ the quasispecies
survives at the expense of weakening the immune system significantly or even
destroying it, for $\nu<\lambda$ the fittest genotypes of the quasispecies
become mimicked inside the immune system as pathogenic idiotypes. The latter is
in agreement with the current understanding of the HIV quasispecies.

cosmological fluctuations originally exited the Hubble radius when the

statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum at
large length scales. An interesting consequence is that these modes might be
observable only at relatively late times. Therefore low redshift observations
could provide evidence for, or even falsify, various bouncing models. We
provide an example where a recently hinted potential deviation from
$\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter cosmology results from a dark matter and dark energy
interaction. The same interaction allows matter bounce models to generate a red
tilt for the primordial curvature perturbations in corroboration with cosmic
microwave background experiments.

deletion techniques upon sale or surrender of storage devices. A logical
assumption is that many users are still confused concerning proper sanitization
techniques of devices upon surrender. This paper strives to measure this
assumption through a buyback study with a survey component. We recorded
participants' thoughts and beliefs concerning deletion, as well as general
demographic information, in relation to actual deletion effectiveness on USB
thumb drives. Thumb drives were chosen for this study due to their relative low
cost, ease of use, and ubiquity. In addition, we also bought used thumb drives
from eBay and Amazon Marketplace to use as a comparison to the wider world.
  We found that there is no statistically significant difference between
buyback and market drives in terms of deletion methods nor presence of
sensitive data, and thus our study may be predictive of the perceptions of the
market sellers. In our combined data sets, we found over 60% of the drives
tested still had recoverable sensitive data, and in the buyback group, we found
no correlation between users' perceived versus actual effectiveness of deletion
methods. Our results suggest the security community may need to take a

proposed, where not only provides intelligent control ability of machines to
user, but also utilizes big data and optimization techniques to provide
promotional offers to the user to optimize energy consumption of machines.
Since a high traffic communication is involved among the machines and the
optimization-big data core of system, the communication core of the proposed
system is designed based on cloud, where many challenging issues such as
spectrum assignment and resource management are involved. To deal with that,
the communication network in the home area network (HAN) is designed based on
the cognitive radio system, where a new spectrum assignment method based on the
ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed to perform spectrum
assignment to the machines in the HAN. Performance evaluation of the proposed
spectrum assignment method shows its performance in fair spectrum assignment
among machines.

paper. A (k,g) graph is a regular graph with degree k and girth g. This catalog
of (3,g) graphs for even girth g satisfying 6 <= g <= 16, has the following
properties. Firstly, this catalog contains the smallest known (3, g) graphs. An
appropriate class of cubic graphs for this catalog has been identified, such
that the (3,g) graph of minimum order within the class is also the smallest
known (3,g) graph. Secondly, this catalog contains (3,g) graphs for more orders
than other listings. Thirdly, the class of graphs have been defined so that a
practical algorithm to generate graphs can be created. Fourthly, this catalog
is infinite, since the results are extended into knowledge about infinitely
many graphs. The findings are as follows. Firstly, Hamiltonian bipartite graphs
have been identified as a promising class of cubic graphs that can lead to a
catalog of (3,g) graphs for even girth g with graphs for more orders than other
listings, that is also expected to contain a (3,g) graph with minimum order.
Secondly, this catalog of (3,g) graphs contains many non-vertex-transitive

same time, to enable deeper analysis on the results, symmetry factor has been
introduced as a measure of the extent of rotational symmetry along the
identified Hamiltonian cycle. The D3 chord index notation is introduced as a
concise notation for cubic Hamiltonian bipartite graphs. The D3 chord index
notation is twice as compact as the LCF notation. The D3 chord index notation
can specify an infinite family of graphs. Fourthly, results on the minimum
order for existence of a (3,g) Hamiltonian bipartite graph, and minimum value
of symmetry factor for existence of a (3,g) Hamiltonian bipartite graph are of

hidden Markov processes underlie the same principles. This analogy immediately
raises questions on the existence of hidden states also in quantum random walks
and their relationship with earlier debates on hidden states in quantum
mechanics. The overarching insight was that not only hidden Markov processes,
but also quantum random walks are finitary processes. Since finitary processes
enjoy nice asymptotic properties, this also encourages to further investigate
the asymptotic properties of quantum random walks. Here, answers to all these
questions are given. Quantum random walks, hidden Markov processes and finitary
processes are put into a unifying model context. In this context, quantum
random walks are seen to not only enjoy nice ergodic properties in general, but
also intuitive quantum-style asymptotic properties. It is also pointed out how
hidden states arising from our framework relate to hidden states in earlier,
prominent treatments on topics such as the EPR paradoxon or Bell's
inequalities.

scenarios of leptogenesis: (i) resonant mixing and (ii) oscillations between
different flavours can be unambiguously identified within the Kadanoff-Baym
formalism. These contributions are isolated by analyzing the spectral structure
of the non-equilibrium propagators without relying on the definition of
particle number densities. The mixing source is associated with the usual mass
shells, whereas the oscillation source is identified with a third intermediate
shell. In addition, we identify terms lying on the oscillation shell that can
be interpreted as the destructive interference between mixing and oscillation.
We confirm that identical shell structure is obtained in both the Heisenberg-
and interaction-picture realizations of the Kadanoff-Baym formalism. In so
doing, we illustrate the self-consistency and complementarity of these two
approaches. The interaction-picture approach in particular has the advantage
that it may be used to analyze all forms of mass spectra from quasi-degenerate
through to hierarchical.

  assumptions","Contribution to the Marcel Grossmann Meeting MG14",,,,"physics.gen-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite considerable progress in several approaches to quantum gravity, there
remain uncertainties on the conceptual level. One issue concerns the different
roles played by space and time in the canonical quantum formalism. This issue
occurs because the Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics is being quantised. The question
then arises whether additional physically relevant states could exist which
cannot be represented in the canonical form or as a partition function. For
this reason, the author has explored a statistical approach (NDA) which is not
based on quantum dynamical assumptions and does not require space-time
splitting boundary conditions either. For dimension 3+1 and under thermal
equilibrium, NDA simplifies to a path integral model. However, the general case
of NDA cannot be written as a partition function. As a test of NDA, one
recovers general relativity at low curvature and quantum field theory in the
flat space-time approximation. Related paper: arxiv:1505.03719.

composite material with viscoelastic phases, we revisit the so-called analytic
method (Bergman 1978), which allows one to approximate the complex effective
tensor, function of the ratio of the component shear moduli, as the sum of
poles weighted by positive semidefinite residue matrices. The novelty of this
investigation lies in the application of such a method, previously applied
(Milton 1980; Bergman 1980) to problems involving cyclic loadings in the
frequency domain, to derive bounds in the time domain for the antiplane
viscoelasticity case. The position of the poles and the residues matrices are
the variational parameters of the problem: the aim is to determine such
parameters in order to have the minimum (or maximum) response at any given
moment in time. All the information about the composite is translated for each
fixed pole configuration into constraints on the residues, the so-called sum
rules. The linearity of the constraints, along with the observation that the
response at a fixed time is linear in the residues, enables one to use the
theory of linear programming to reduce the problem to one involving relatively
few non-zero residues. Finally, bounds on the response are obtained by
numerically optimizing over the pole positions. In the examples studied, the
results turn out to be very accurate estimates: if sufficient information about
the composite is available, the bounds can be quite tight over the entire range
of time, allowing one to predict the transient behavior of the composite.
Furthermore, the bounds incorporating the volume fractions (and possibly
transverse isotropy) can be extremely tight at certain specific times.

  arXiv:1505.04656",,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the
authors, is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and
amino acids. The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a
prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with
each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer
quaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of
the standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show
the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,
associated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type
quaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order
quaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the
tertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this
context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the
set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of
subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by
putting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D
and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,
respectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we
define functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer
quaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a
given D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that
one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for
the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to
describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.

the thermally relativistic flow \textcolor{red}{by focusing on the
characteristics of the diffusion flux}. As an analytical object, we consider
the relativistic rarefied-shock layer problem around the triangle prism.
Numerical results of the diffusion flux are compared with the
Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) order approximation of the diffusion flux, which is
calculated using the diffusion and thermal-diffusion coefficients by Kox
\textit{et al}. [Physica A, 84, 1, pp.165-174 (1976)]. In the case of the
uniform flow with the small Lorentz contraction, the diffusion flux, which is
obtained by calculating the relativistic Boltzmann equation, is roughly
approximated by the NSF order approximation inside the shock wave, whereas the
diffusion flux in the vicinity of the wall is markedly different from the NSF
order approximation. The magnitude of the diffusion flux, which is obtained by
calculating the relativistic Boltzmann equation, is similar to that of the NSF
order approximation inside the shock wave, unlike the pressure deviator,
dynamic pressure and heat flux, even when the Lorentz contraction in the
uniform flow becomes large, because the diffusion flux does not depend on the
generic Knudsen number from its definition in Eckart's frame.
\textcolor{red}{Finally, the author concludes that the accurate diffusion flux
must be calculated from the particle four flow, which is formulated using the
four velocity distinguished by each species of particles.
