an observable to be \emph{any} Hermitian operator, and use the pre- and

These restrictions include non-functional requirements of low-power

Optimization Protocol) is a routing algorithm based on ant-colony optimizations
that target such small-size and low-cost platforms, consuming little amounts of

use of energy-related heuristics to guide routing decisions. The goal is to
minimize network usage without jeopardizing network operation. We replace the
original ADHOP heuristic of network latency by two energy-related heuristics
based on the battery charge and the estimated node lifetime. Simulations
compare the energy-aware versions of ADHOP to its original version, to AODV and
to AOER. Results show that the proposed approaches are able to balance network
load among nodes, resulting in a lower number of failures due to battery
depletion. The energy-aware versions of ADHOP also deliver more packets than
their counter-parts in the simulated scenario, delivering 2x more packets than
the original ADHOP, and, respectively, 5x and 9x more packets than AOER and

elliptic problem involving critical Sobolev exponent for a polyharmonic
operator on a Riemannian manifold $M$. We first show that the best constant of
the Sobolev embedding on a manifold can be chosen as close as one wants to the
Euclidean one, and as a consequence derive the existence of minimizers when the
energy functional goes below a quantified threshold. Next, higher energy
solutions are obtained by Coron's topological method, provided that the
minimizing solution does not exist. To perform this topological argument, we
overcome the difficulty of dealing with polyharmonic operators on a Riemannian
manifold and adapting Lions's concentration-compactness lemma. Unlike Coron's
original argument for a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we need to do more
than chopping out a small ball from the manifold $M$. Indeed, our topological
assumption that a small sphere on $M$ centred at a point $p \in M$ does not
retract to a point in $M\backslash \{ p \}$ is necessary, as shown for the case
of the canonical sphere where chopping out a small ball is not enough.

unstructured meshes as collections of cells, faces, and edges, each of which
require associated coordinate systems. One then needs to store how the
coordinate system of each edge relates to that of neighboring cells. On the
other hand, we can simplify data structures and algorithms if we can a priori
orient coordinate systems in such a way that the coordinate systems on the
edges follows uniquely from those on the cells \textit{by rule}.
  Such rules require that \textit{every} unstructured mesh allows assigning
directions to edges that satisfy the convention in adjacent cells. We show that
the convention chosen for unstructured quadrilateral meshes in the
\texttt{deal.II} library always allows to orient meshes. It can therefore be
used to make codes simpler, faster, and less bug prone. We present an algorithm
that orients meshes in $O(N)$ operations. We then show that consistent
orientations are not always possible for 3d hexahedral meshes. Thus, cells
generally need to store the direction of adjacent edges, but our approach also
allows the characterization of cases where this is not necessary. The 3d
extension of our algorithm either orients edges consistently, or aborts, both

addition, some NEOs follow orbits temporarily trapped in a web of secular
resonances. These facts contribute to increasing the risk of meteoroid strikes
on Earth, making its proper quantification difficult. The identification and
subsequent study of groups of small NEOs that appear to move in similar
trajectories are necessary steps in improving our understanding of the impact
risk associated with meteoroids. Here, we present results of a search for
statistically significant dynamical groupings among the NEO population. Our
Monte Carlo-based methodology recovers well-documented groupings like the

analyze the evolution of the planet and the disk by analytic means and
hydrodynamic simulations. We generally find that the planet and the disk do not
remain coplanar unless the disk mass is very large or the gap that separates
the planet from the disk is very small. The relative planet-disk tilt undergoes
secular oscillations whose initial amplitudes are typically of order the
initial disk tilt relative to the binary orbital plane for disk masses ~1% of
the binary mass or less. The effects of a secular resonance and the disk tilt
decay enhance the planet-disk misalignment. The secular resonance plays an
important role for disk masses greater than the planet mass. At later times,
the accretion of disk gas by the planet causes its orbit to evolve towards
alignment, if the disk mass is sufficiently large. The results have several

distinct stripe ordered phases. The frustration is very strong and
significantly suppresses the ordering temperature in the regimes close to the

single source-sink pair, it is known that two simple shortest paths cannot be
found in time polynomially smaller than $n^3$ (where $n=|V|$) unless the
All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem can be solved in a similar time bound. The
latter is a well-known open problem in algorithm design. We consider the
all-pairs version of the problem, and we give a new algorithm to find $k$
simple shortest paths for all pairs of vertices. For $k=2$, our algorithm runs
in $O(mn + n^2 \log n)$ time (where $m=|E|$), which is almost the same bound as

is based on forming suitable path extensions to find simple shortest paths;
this method is different from the `detour finding' technique used in most of
the prior work on simple shortest paths, replacement paths, and distance
sensitivity oracles.
  Enumerating simple cycles is a well-studied classical problem. We present new
algorithms for generating simple cycles and simple paths in $G$ in
non-decreasing order of their weights; the algorithm for generating simple
paths is much faster, and uses another variant of path extensions. We also give
hardness results for sparse graphs, relative to the complexity of computing a
minimum weight cycle in a graph, for several variants of problems related to

junction coupled to two microwave cavities, with each cavity coupled to a
thermal bath. Resonant Cooper pair tunneling occurs with the exchange of
photons between cavities, and a temperature difference between the baths can
naturally lead to a current against the voltage, and hence work. As a
consequence of the unique properties of Cooper-pair tunneling, the heat current
is completely separated from the charge current. This combined with the strong
energy-selectivity of the process leads to an extremely high efficiency.

multimode effects for traveling optical photons. We measure a conditional

$U$-statistics in the observations. The $U$-statistics are based on higher
order influence functions that extend ordinary linear influence functions of

For parameters for which the representation cannot be perfect the method leads
to a bias-variance trade-off, and results in estimators that converge at a
slower than $\sqrt n$-rate. In a number of examples the resulting rate can be
shown to be optimal. We are particularly interested in estimating parameters in
models with a nuisance parameter of high dimension or low regularity, where the
parameter of interest cannot be estimated at $\sqrt n$-rate, but we also
consider efficient $\sqrt n$-estimation using novel nonlinear estimators. The
general approach is applied in detail to the example of estimating a mean

that each node may transmit at most one rumor in one step.

ground state or a squeezed state, and is proved without recourse to
perturbation expansion in the $\kappa_n$'s as in MSS. We compute exact
time-dependent correlators for some specific quench protocols $m(t)$. The
correlators explicitly show thermalization to a generalized Gibbs ensemble
(GGE), with inverse temperature $\beta= 4\kappa_2$, and chemical potentials
$\mu_n=4\kappa_n$. In case the pre-quench state is a ground state, it is
possible to retrieve the exact quench protocol $m(t)$ from the final GGE, by an
application of inverse scattering techniques. Another notable result, which we
interpret as a UV/IR mixing, is that the long distance and long time (IR)
behaviour of some correlators depends crucially on all $\kappa_n$'s, although
they are highly irrelevant couplings in the usual RG parlance. This indicates
subtleties in RG arguments when applied to non-equilibrium dynamics.

nonpositive definite invariant metric, the indefiniteness of the metric
suggesting an apparent lack of unitarity. It is shown that the theory is UV
divergent at one loop and that there are no radiative corrections at higher
loops. One-loop UV divergences are removed through renormalization of the
coupling constant, thus introducing a renormalization scale. The terms in the
classical action that would spoil unitarity are proved to be cohomologically
trivial with respect to the Slavnov-Taylor operator that controls gauge
invariance for the quantum theory. Hence they do not contribute gauge invariant
radiative corrections to the quantum effective action and the theory is
unitary.

singular equivariant asymptotics of oscillatory integrals, we further
characterize the caustic behaviour of the reduced spectral function near

that motions parallel to the line of sight can also account for linear trends,
for the apparent excess of DM variance over that extrapolated from

may produce bow-shock ionized gas that also contributes to DM variations. We
discuss possible causes of periodic or quasi-periodic changes in DM, including
seasonal changes in the ionosphere, annual variation of the solar elongation
angle, structure in the heliosphere-ISM boundary, and substructure in the ISM.

the error in transforming arrival times to the solar system barycenter. We

This article uses computer simulations to probe a particle-scale perturbation

rodlike fd viruses in the presence of a polymer depletant. Motivated by
experiments currently in progress, we simulate the interaction between a
microtubule and a monolayer membrane as the microtubule ""pokes"" and penetrates
the membrane face-on. Both the viruses and the microtubule are modeled as hard
spherocylinders of the same diameter, while the depletant is modeled using
ghost spheres. We find that the force exerted on the microtubule by the
membrane is zero either when the microtubule is completely outside the membrane
or when it has fully penetrated the membrane. The microtubule is initially
repelled by the membrane as it begins to penetrate but experiences an
attractive force as it penetrates further. We assess the roles played by
translational and rotational fluctuations of the viruses and the osmotic
pressure of the polymer depletant. We find that rotational fluctuations play a
more important role than the translational ones. The dependence on the osmotic
pressure of the depletant of the width and height of the repulsive barrier and
the depth of the attractive potential well is consistent with the assumed
depletion-induced attractive interaction between the microtubule and viruses.
We discuss the relevance of these studies to the experimental investigations.

D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to
Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables, this results in a
time-to-99%-success-probability that is $\sim 10^8$ times faster than SA
running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical
processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA:
D-Wave 2X again runs up to $\sim 10^8$ times faster than an optimized
implementation of QMC on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic
classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured
problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that
such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers
currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will
also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct
numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be
represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number
partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms
designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA. We discuss the implications of
these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.

require couplings of the new Higgs doublet to down-type quarks, opening the
door to many highly constrained flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC)

relates the new up- and down-type Yukawa couplings, and demonstrate viable
values of the couplings that are free from fine tuning. LEP and LHC searches
for new Higgs bosons decaying via $H^0\to \tau^+\tau^-$ and
$H^\pm\to\tau^\pm\nu$ allow a window of masses $m_H = [100$-$125]\,$GeV and

less prevalent than bars, originates from external perturbations from

relies on measurements of the kinematic endpoints in the invariant mass
distributions of suitable collections of visible decay products. However, the
procedure is complicated by combinatorial ambiguities: e.g., the visible final
state particles may be indistinguishable (as in the case of QCD jets), or one
may not know the exact order in which they are emitted along the decay chain.
In order to avoid such combinatorial ambiguities, we propose to treat the final
state particles fully democratically and consider the sorted set of the
invariant masses of all possible partitions of the visible particles in the
decay chain. In particular, for a decay to N visible particles, one considers
the sorted sets of all possible n-body invariant mass combinations (2 <= n <=
N) and determines the kinematic endpoint m_(n,r)^max of the distribution of the
r-th largest n-body invariant mass m_(n,r) for each possible value of n and r.
For the classic example of a squark decay in supersymmetry, we provide
analytical formulas for the interpretation of these endpoints in terms of the
underlying physical masses. We point out that these measurements can be used to
determine the structure of the decay topology, e.g., the number and position of
intermediate on-shell resonances.

strong spin-orbit coupling has been a recent subject of intensive studies.
While it has been realized that spin-orbit coupling can provide non-trivial
band topology in weakly interacting electron systems, as in topological
insulators and semi-metals, the role of electron-electron interaction in
strongly spin-orbit coupled systems has not been fully understood. The
availability of new materials with significant electron correlation and strong
spin-orbit coupling now makes such investigations possible. Many of these
materials contain 5d or 4d transition metal elements; the prominent examples
are iridium oxides or iridates. In this review, we succinctly discuss recent
theoretical and experimental progress on this subject. After providing a brief
overview, we focus on pyrochlore iridates and three-dimensional honeycomb
iridates. In pyrochlore iridates, we discuss the quantum criticality of the
bulk and surface states, and the relevance of the surface/boundary states in a
number of topological and magnetic ground states, both in the bulk and thin
film configurations. Experimental signatures of these boundary and bulk states
are discussed. Domain wall formation and strongly-direction-dependent
magneto-transport are also discussed. Regarding the three-dimensional honeycomb
iridates, we consider possible quantum spin liquid phases and unusual magnetic
orders in theoretical models with strongly bond-dependent interactions. These
theoretical ideas and results are discussed in light of recent resonant X-ray
scattering experiments on three-dimensional honeycomb iridates. We also
contrast these results with the situation in two-dimensional honeycomb
iridates. We conclude with the outlook on other related systems.

large, the field theory result is a quadratic form in the gauge group ranks
involving the inverse of the A_N Cartan matrix C. The agreement can be
understood as a continuum limit, using the fact that C is a lattice analogue of
a second derivative. The discrete data of the field theory, summarized by two

Conversely, the geometry of the internal space gets discretized at the quantum

Target) and currently it is running in the antineutrino mode. The main aim of
the antineutrino run is to measure the leptonic phase $\delta_{CP}$ which may
help to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In this
work we show that in T2K, antineutrinos are required only for removing the
wrong octant solutions which in turn improves the CP sensitivity. If however
the octant is known then pure neutrino run is capable of giving the maximum CP
sensitivity. If we divide the total true parameter space into eight sets, then
we find that T2K antineutrino run helps in improving the CP sensitivity for
only two sets while for the remaining six combinations pure neutrino run gives
the best CP sensitivity. Thus if the neutrino run is replaced by the
antineutrino run then it causes a reduction in the CP sensitivity in 75$\%$ of
the true parameter space due to lesser statistics. Thus it is worthwhile to
study if the T2K antineutrino run can be reduced by the antineutrino runs of
the other experiments, so that T2K can run in dominant neutrino mode to extract
the best CP sensitivity. In this work we explore the possibility of the
antineutrino component of NO$\nu$A and the atmospheric neutrino experiment
ICAL@INO for compensating the antineutrino run of T2K.

quite high (73s, 34s, 58s for the filters B, R and I), which can help us trace
the profile of the variation and search for the short inter-band time delay.
Intra-day variability was about 0.1 mag on the first two nights and more than
0.3 mag on the third. A bluer-when-brighter color behavior was found. An clear
loop path can be seen on the color-magnitude diagram of the third night,
revealing possible time delays between variations at high and low energies. It
is the first time that the intra-day spectral hysteresis loop has been found so

function method to further confirm the time delay and calculated the values of
lag between light curves at different wavelengths on each night. On the third
night, variations in the R and B bands is approximately 1.5 minutes lagging
behind the I band. Such optical time delay is probably due to the interplay of
different processes of electrons in the jet of the blazar.

have historically relied on the detection of displaced particles produced by
their decay $\textit{within}$ the detector volume. In this paper we study the
potential of the complementary signature comprising of the missing transverse
energy ($E_T^{miss}$) signal, traditionally used to look for dark matter, e.g.,
the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), to extend the LHC coverage to
models with long-lived (LL) particles when they decay $\textit{outside}$ the
detector. Using CMS and ATLAS analyses at the 8 TeV LHC, we set an upper limit
at the 95% confidence level (CL) on the production cross sections for two
specific scenarios: (i) a model with a heavy non-standard model Higgs boson
decaying to a LL scalar and (ii) an R-parity violating RPV SUSY model with a LL
neutralino.
  We show that this method can significantly extend the LHC sensitivity to
neutral, LL particles with arbitrary large lifetimes and that the limits
obtained from a $E_T^{miss}$ signal are comparable to those from displaced
particle searches for decay distances above a few meters. Results obtained in
this study do not not depend on the specific decay channel of the LL particle
and therefore are model-independent in this sense. We provide limits for the
whole two-dimensional plane in terms of the mass of the LL particle and the
mass of the mediator up to masses of 2 TeV including particular benchmarks
studied in the original experimental papers. We have made these limits
available in the form of a grid which can be used for the interpretation of

black brane geometry can be thought of as RG-flow. We do this by first
constructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane
geometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases
monotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior
of the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a
thermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the
temperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an
entanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on
infinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity
of an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So
this is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we
expect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon
goes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive
to the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function
should also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that
high temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate
$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.
Negativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the
theory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.
  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the
paradigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact
that the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the
two facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of
geometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature
singularity.

distances, which are based on a gravity model predicting the existence of
significant trade channels, are such that the closer countries are in trade

with information regarding the long-term evolution of the international trade
system and demonstrates that, in terms of trade, the world is not flat but
hyperbolic, as a reflection of its complex architecture. The departure from
flatness has been increasing since World War I, meaning that differences in
trade distances are growing and trade networks are becoming more hierarchical.
Smaller-scale economies are moving away from other countries except for the
largest economies; meanwhile those large economies are increasing their chances
of becoming connected worldwide. At the same time, Preferential Trade
Agreements do not fit in perfectly with natural communities within the trade
space and have not necessarily reduced internal trade barriers. We discuss an
interpretation in terms of globalization, hierarchization, and localization;
three simultaneous forces that shape the international trade system.

than ~50AU implies that protoplanetary discs dispersed from the inside out must
remove gas from the outer regions rapidly. We investigate the role of
photoevaporation in the final clearing of gas from low mass discs with inner
holes. In particular, we study the so-called ""thermal sweeping"" mechanism which
results in rapid clearing of the disc. Thermal sweeping was originally thought
to arise when the radial and vertical pressure scale lengths at the X-ray
heated inner edge of the disc match. We demonstrate that this criterion is not
fundamental. Rather, thermal sweeping occurs when the pressure maximum at the
inner edge of the dust heated disc falls below the maximum possible pressure of
X-ray heated gas (which depends on the local X-ray flux). We derive new
critical peak volume and surface density estimates for rapid radiative clearing
which, in general, result in rapid dispersal happening less readily than in
previous estimates. This less efficient clearing of discs by X-ray driven
thermal sweeping leaves open the issue of what mechanism can clear gas from the
outer disc sufficiently quickly to explain the non-detection of cold gas around
weak line T Tauri stars.

yielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 keV range, revealing
that the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the X-ray spectral
shape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,
with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up to
about 80 keV. For the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and the
inverse-Compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (SED) simultaneously
shifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order of
magnitude. The fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows a
double-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband SED. In
each bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of the
synchrotron self-Compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energies
are more variable. The measured multi-band variability, the significant
X-ray-to-VHE correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed in
both bands, the lack of correlation between optical/UV and X-ray flux, the low
degree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the short
estimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variability
timescale observed in the NuSTAR light curves point toward in-situ electron
acceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributing
to the broadband emission of Mrk 421 during low-activity states.

linear stage of structure formation. Such a theory predicts alignments between
the spin of haloes and tidal shear field. However, non-linear evolution and
angular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. In this
paper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiar
velocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within $115\,
\mathrm{Mpc} $ ($\sim8000 \, {\mathrm {km}}{\mathrm s}^{-1}$) from 2MRS
catalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes of
shear field. Although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked at
similar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments with
velocity-shear field. Ellipticals in the 2MRS sample, show a statistically
significant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. In
general, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis of
greatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression.
Spiral galaxies show no signal. Such an alignment is significantly strengthened
when considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity field
reconstruction. When examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axis
of greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. This result
indicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairly
noisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strong
enough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered -
especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.

- for generating the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. We show how
quantum loop effects in C and CP violating theories cause matter and antimatter
to propagate differently in the presence of gravity, and prove this is
forbidden in flat space by CPT and translation symmetry. This generates a
curvature-dependent chemical potential for leptons, allowing a
matter-antimatter asymmetry to be generated in thermal equilibrium in the early
Universe. The time-dependent dynamics necessary for leptogenesis is provided by
the interaction of the virtual self-energy cloud of the leptons with the
expanding curved spacetime background, which violates the strong equivalence
principle and allows a distinction between matter and antimatter. We show here
how this mechanism is realised in a particular BSM theory, the see-saw model,
where the quantum loops involve the heavy sterile neutrinos responsible for
light neutrino masses. We demonstrate by explicit computation of the relevant
two-loop Feynman diagrams how these radiative corrections display the necessary
dependence on the sterile neutrino masses to generate an asymmetry, and show
how the induced lepton asymmetry may be sufficiently large to play an important
role in determining the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe.

any two points on the augmented network. Unlike in the discrete setting where a
shortcut connects two vertices and the diameter is measured between vertices,
we take all points along the edges of the network into account when placing a
shortcut and when measuring distances in the augmented network.
  We study this network augmentation problem for paths and cycles. For paths,
we determine an optimal shortcut in linear time. For cycles, we show that a
single shortcut never decreases the continuous diameter and that two shortcuts
always suffice to reduce the continuous diameter. Furthermore, we characterize
optimal pairs of shortcuts for convex and non-convex cycles. Finally, we
develop a linear time algorithm that produces an optimal pair of shortcuts for
convex cycles. Apart from the algorithms, our results extend to rectifiable
curves.
  Our work reveals some of the underlying challenges that must be overcome when
addressing the discrete version of this network augmentation problem, where we
minimize the discrete diameter of a network with shortcuts that connect only
vertices.

for Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. Here, we show these different boundary
conditions produce two different sets of superradiant modes. Interestingly the
""new modes"" may be unstable in a larger parameter space. We then study
stationary Maxwell clouds, that exist at the threshold of the superradiant
instability, with the two Robin boundary conditions. These clouds, obtained at
the linear level, indicate the existence of a new family of black hole
solutions at the nonlinear level, within the Einstein-Maxwell-AdS system,
branching off from the Kerr-Newman-AdS family. As a comparison with the Maxwell
clouds, scalar clouds on Kerr-AdS black holes are also studied, and it is shown

particles produced at hadron colliders based on the analysis of the energy
distribution of a massless product from their two-body decays. The central
ingredient of our proposal is the remarkable result that, for an unpolarized
decaying particle, the location of the peak in the energy distribution of the
observed decay product is identical to the (fixed) value of the energy that
this particle would have in the rest-frame of the decaying particle, which, in
turn, is a simple function of the involved masses. In addition, we utilized the
property that this energy distribution is symmetric around the location of peak
when energy is plotted on a logarithmic scale. The general strategy was
demonstrated in several specific cases, including both beyond the SM particles,
as well as for the top quark. In the present work, we generalize this method to
the case of a massive decay product from a two-body decay; this procedure is
far from trivial because (in general) both the above- mentioned properties are
no longer valid. Nonetheless, we propose a suitably modified parametrization of
the energy distribution that was used successfully for the massless case, which
can deal with the massive case as well. We establish the accuracy of this
parametrization using concrete examples of energy spectra of Z bosons from the
decay of a heavier stop into a Z boson and a lighter stop. We then study a
realistic application for the same process, but now including dominant
backgrounds and using foreseeable statistics at LHC14, in order to determine
the performance of this method for an actual mass measurement. The upshot of
our present and previous work is that, in spite of energy being a
Lorentz-variant quantity, its distribution emerges as a powerful tool for mass
measurement at hadron colliders.

One example is the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with spin-liquid
ground states and anyonic excitations. Another example is the geometrically
frustrated quantum $120^\circ$ model on the same lattice whose ground state has
not been unambiguously established. To generalize the Kitaev model beyond the
exactly solvable limit and connect it with other compass models, we propose a
new model, dubbed ""the tripod model"", which contains a continuum of

model, and the quantum $120^\circ$ model by tuning a single parameter
$\theta'$, the angle between the three legs of a tripod in the spin space.
Hence it not only unifies three paradigmatic spin models, but also enables the
study of their quantum phase transitions. We obtain the phase diagram of the
tripod model numerically by tensor networks in the thermodynamic limit. We show
that the ground state of the quantum $120^\circ$ model has long-range dimer
order. Moreover, we find an extended spin-disordered (spin-liquid) phase
between the dimer phase and an antiferromagnetic phase. The unification and
solution of a continuum of frustrated spin models as outline here may be useful

produces a Tc=50K level with conventional plane and cell volume contracted
varieties (P-V-), based on plane oxidizing (4) where (n) denotes local O
coordination. When these materials are quenched from <600K, the subsequent
changes at 298K of structural parameters or Tc have activation energies E=92kJ
and A=1.0x10-12s. The changes saturate at temperatures where they are faster
than the time constant t of quenching. This temperature is extended to 473K
with SQ, indicating t=0.1s. SQ of y near 6.44 from >600K leads to increased
axial ratios, plane and V expansion (P+V+), in a process which is complete near
670 and extending to 950K. P+V+ effects can far exceed P0V0 of the respective
semiconductor. The relative stability at elevated temperatures indicates
another intrinsically slower transformation mechanism of primarily electronic
nature with E=280kJ, involving O-. V+ and its Tc=100K level, is ascribed to (3)
with doped charge on apical O-, acting as a plane expander and n-doper. Similar
slowing of kinetic through O- also hold for the more complex range of Tq>950K.
It can produce a c-axis contracted non-superconductor (P+C-) and indications
for elevated temperature superconductivity (ETS) with Tc>150K*. Kinetic data
are embedded into general thermodynamic arguments concerning peroxide stability

auctions are the Monotone Hazard Rate (MHR) and Regular distributions. They can
both be characterized in terms of the rate of change of the associated virtual
value functions: for MHR distributions the condition is that for values $v <
v'$, $\phi(v') - \phi(v) \ge v' - v$, and for regular distributions, $\phi(v')
- \phi(v) \ge 0$. Cole and Roughgarden introduced the interpolating class of
$\alpha$-Strongly Regular distributions ($\alpha$-SR distributions for short),
for which $\phi(v') - \phi(v) \ge \alpha(v' - v)$, for $0 \le \alpha \le 1$.
  In this paper, we investigate five distinct auction settings for which good
expected revenue bounds are known when the bidders' valuations are given by MHR
distributions. In every case, we show that these bounds degrade gracefully when
extended to $\alpha$-SR distributions. For four of these settings, the auction
mechanism requires knowledge of these distribution(s) (in the other setting,
the distributions are needed only to ensure good bounds on the expected
revenue). In these cases we also investigate what happens when the
distributions are known only approximately via samples, specifically how to
modify the mechanisms so that they remain effective and how the expected
revenue depends on the number of samples.

reflection transforms the soliton into a shock with a trailing wave and a foot
populated by the reflected ions. The solution relates parameters of the entire
shock structure, such as the maximum and minimum of the potential in the
trailing wave, the height of the foot, as well as the shock Mach number, to the
number of reflected ions. This relation is resolvable for any given
distribution of the upstream ions. In this paper, we have resolved it for a
simple ""box"" distribution. Two separate models of electron interaction with the
shock are considered. The first model corresponds to the standard Boltzmannian
electron distribution in which case the critical shock Mach number only
insignificantly increases from M=1.6 (no ion reflection) to M=1.8 (substantial
reflection). The second model corresponds to adiabatically trapped electrons.
They produce a stronger increase, from M=3.1 to M=4.5. The shock foot that is
supported by the reflected ions also accelerates them somewhat further. A

radial data as a limit of radial solutions to initial-boundary value problems
posed on the exterior of vanishing balls centered at the origin. The goal is to
gauge the effectiveness of this approach in a simple, concrete setting: the
3-dimensional, linear wave equation $\square_{1+3}U=0$ with radial Cauchy data
$U(0,x)=\Phi(x)=\phi(|x|)$, $U_t(0,x)=\Psi(x)=\psi(|x|)$.
  We are primarily interested in this as a model situation for other, possibly
nonlinear, equations where neither formulae nor abstract existence results are
available for the radial symmetric Cauchy problem. In treating the 3-d wave
equation we therefore insist on robust arguments based on energy methods and
strong convergence. (In particular, this work does not address what can be
established via solution formulae.)
  Our findings for the 3-d wave equation show that while one can obtain
existence of radial Cauchy solutions via exterior solutions, one should not
expect such results to be optimal. The standard existence result for the linear
wave equation guarantees a unique solution in $C([0,T);H^s(\mathbb{R}^3))$
whenever $(\Phi,\Psi)\in H^s\times H^{s-1}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. However, within the
constrained framework outlined above, we obtain strictly lower regularity for
solutions obtained as limits of exterior solutions. We also show that external
Neumann solutions yield better regularity than external Dirichlet solutions.
Specifically, for Cauchy data in $H^2\times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ we obtain
$H^1$-solutions via exterior Neumann solutions, and only $L^2$-solutions via
exterior Dirichlet solutions.

significantly increase revenue. However, bundling is no longer profitable if
the goods have high production costs. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
a new mechanism, Pure Bundling with Disposal for Cost (PBDC), where after
buying the bundle, the customer is allowed to return any subset of goods for
their costs.
  We provide two types of guarantees on the profit of PBDC mechanisms relative
to the optimum in the presence of production costs, under the assumption that
customers have valuations which are additive over the items and drawn
independently. We first provide a distribution-dependent guarantee which shows
that PBDC earns at least 1-6c^{2/3} of the optimal profit, where c denotes the
coefficient of variation of the welfare random variable. c approaches 0 if
there are a large number of items whose individual valuations have bounded
coefficients of variation, and our constants improve upon those from the
classical result of Bakos and Brynjolfsson (1999) without costs.
  We then provide a distribution-free guarantee which shows that either PBDC or
individual sales earns at least 1/5.2 times the optimal profit, generalizing
and improving the constant of 1/6 from the celebrated result of Babaioff et al.
(2014). Conversely, we also provide the best-known upper bound on the
performance of any partitioning mechanism (which captures both individual sales
and pure bundling), of 1/1.19 times the optimal profit, improving on the
previously-known upper bound of 1/1.08.
  Finally, we conduct simulations under the same playing field as the extensive
numerical study of Chu et al. (2011), which confirm that PBDC outperforms other
simple pricing schemes overall.

from clear atmospheres with Rayleigh scattering, and cloudy or hazy atmospheres
with Mie and fractal aggregate particles. We show that clear and cloudy

distinction. Futhermore, we show that atmospheres that are spatially
inhomogeneous, such as being partially covered by clouds or hazes, exhibit
larger contrasts in polarized light when compared to clear atmospheres. This
effect can potentially be used to identify patchy clouds in exoplanets. Given a
set of full phase polarimetric measurements, this model can constrain the
geometric albedo, properties of scattering particles in the atmosphere and the

An exact solution to the two-site Holstein model is presented in this paper.
The obtained results provide a clear image of the Hamiltonian structure and
allow for the investigation of the symmetry, energy level crossings and
polaronic characteristics of the system. The main mathematical tool is a
three-term recurrence relation between the wave function amplitudes that was
obtained using the properties of a family of orthogonal functions, namely the
Poisson-Charlier polynomials. It is shown that, with the appropriate choice of
basis, the eigenfunctions of the problem naturally fall into two families
(parities) associated with the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry of the
Hamiltonian. The asymptotic solution to the recurrence relation is found by
using the Birkhoff expansion. The asymptotic sets the truncation criterion for
the wave function, which ensures the accurate calculation of the energy levels
for any strength of electron-phonon interaction. Level crossing of states with
different parities is discussed and the exact points of broken symmetry are
found analytically. The results are used as the building blocks for studying a
four-site system. The inherited symmetries lead to the formation of a sparse
matrix that is convenient for numerical calculations.

neighbor sensors via random inter-sensor communications to propagate
information. By modeling the information propagation dynamics in the network as
a Markov process, two-layer large deviation analysis is presented to analyze
the performance of the proposed algorithm. The first-layer analysis shows that
the relation between the probability of false alarm and the conditional

the probability of false alarm according to a rare event decays to zero at an
exponentially fast rate when the conditional averaged detection decay
increases, where the Kullback-Leibler information number is established as a

diversity of many natural populations. Here, we apply the Shannon concept to
consecutive generations of alleles as they evolve over time. We suppose a
genetic system analogous to the discrete noisy channel of Shannon, where the
signal emitted by the input (mother population) is a number of alleles that
will form the next generation (offspring). The alleles received at a given
generation are conditional upon the previous generation. Knowledge of this
conditional probability law allows us to track the evolution of the allele
entropies and mutual information values from one generation to the next. We
apply these laws to numerical computer simulations and to real data
(Stryphnodendron adstringens). We find that, due to the genetic sampling
process, in the absence of new mutations the mutual information increases
between generations toward a maximum value. Lastly, after sufficient
generations the system has a level of mutual information equal to the entropy
(diversity) that it had at the beginning of the process (mother population).
This implies no increase in genetic diversity in the absence of new mutations.
Now, obviously, mutations are essential to the evolution of species. In
addition, we observe that when a population shows at least a low level of
genetic diversity, the highest values of mutual information between the
generations occurs when the system is neither too orderly nor too disorderly.
We also find that mutual information is a valid measure of allele fixation.

the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different

simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely
eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage
and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to
train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection

confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional

has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\times

in any source and N2H+ is marginally detected in two sources. The
molecular-cloud scale (10 pc scale) chemical composition is found to be similar

hence, it represents the chemical composition characteristic to the LMC without
influences of star formation activities. In comparison with chemical
compositions of Galactic sources, the characteristic features are (1) deficient
N-bearing molecules, (2) abundant CCH, and (3) deficient CH3OH. The feature (1)
is due to a lower elemental abundance of nitrogen in the LMC, whereas the
features (2) and (3) seem to originate from extended photodissociation regions
and warmer temperature in cloud peripheries due to a lower abundance of dust
grains in the low metallicity condition. In spite of general resemblance of

found to be slightly higher in a quiescent molecular cloud. An origin of this

the one-hop interference model. The objective is twofold: 1) maximizing the
throughput when the flow sources continuously inject packets into the network,
and 2) minimizing the evacuation time when there are no future packet arrivals.
The prior work mostly employs the link-based approach, which leads to
throughput-efficient algorithms but often does not guarantee satisfactory
evacuation time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Node-based
Service-Balanced (NSB) online scheduling algorithm. NSB aims to give scheduling
opportunities to heavily congested nodes in a balanced manner, by maximizing
the total weight of the scheduled nodes in each scheduling cycle, where the
weight of a node is determined by its workload and whether the node was
scheduled in the previous scheduling cycle(s). We rigorously prove that NSB
guarantees to achieve an efficiency ratio no worse (or no smaller) than 2/3 for
the throughput and an approximation ratio no worse (or no greater) than 3/2 for
the evacuation time. It is remarkable that NSB is both throughput-optimal and
evacuation-time-optimal if the underlying network graph is bipartite. Further,
we develop a lower-complexity NSB algorithm, called LC-NSB, which provides the
same performance guarantees as NSB. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments
to elucidate our theoretical results.

the rope axis, and that the MFR's peak $|\mathcal{T}_w|$ temporarily increases
within half an hour before each flare while it decreases after the flare peak
for both confined and eruptive flares. This pre-flare increase in
$|\mathcal{T}_w|$ has little effect on the active region's free magnetic energy
or any other parameters derived for the whole region, due to its moderate
amount and the MFR's relatively small volume, while its decrease after flares
is clearly associated with the stepwise decrease in free magnetic energy due to
the flare. We suggest that $\mathcal{T}_w$ may serve as a useful parameter in
forewarning the onset of eruption, and therefore, the consequent space weather
effects. The helical kink instability is identified as the prime candidate
onset mechanism for the considered flares.

justification of the complex Langevin method, which is a promising method for
evading the sign problem in the path integral with a complex weight. There
still remains, however, an issue concerning occasional failure of this method
in the case where the action involves logarithmic singularities such as the one
appearing from the fermion determinant in finite density QCD. In this talk, we
point out that this failure is due to the breakdown of the relation between the
complex weight which satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation and the probability
distribution generated by the stochastic process. In fact, this kind of failure
can occur in general when the stochastic process involves a singular drift
term. We show, however, in simple examples, that there exists a parameter
region in which the method works although the standard reweighting method is
hardly applicable.

  Contextuality","19 pages",,,,"math.PR quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let random vectors $R^c=\{R_p^c:p\in P_c\}$ represent joint measurements of
certain subsets $P_c$ of properties $p\in P$ in different contexts $c\in C$.
Such a system is traditionally called noncontextual if there exists a jointly
distributed set $\{Q_p:p\in P\}$ of random variables such that $R^c$ has the
same distribution as $\{Q_p:p\in P_c\}$ for all $c\in C$. A trivial necessary
condition for noncontextuality and a precondition for most approaches to
measuring contextuality is that the system is consistently connected, i.e., all
$R_p^c,R_p^{c'},\dots$ measuring the same property $p$ have the same
distribution. The Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) approach allows detecting and
measuring ""true"" contextuality on top of inconsistent connectedness, but at the
price of a higher computational cost.
  In this paper we propose a novel approach to measuring contextuality that
shares the generality and basic definitions of the CbD approach and the
computational benefits of the previously proposed Negative Probability (NP)
approach. The present approach differs from CbD in that instead of considering
all possible joints of the double-indexed random variables $R_p^c$, it
considers all possible approximating single-indexed systems $\{Q_p:p\in P\}$.
The degree of contextuality is defined based on the minimum possible
probabilistic distance of the actual measurements $R^c$ from $\{Q_p:p\in P_c$}.
We show that the defined measure agrees with a certain measure of contextuality
of the CbD approach for all systems where each property enters in exactly two
contexts and that this measure can be calculated far more efficiently than the
CbD measure and even more efficiently than the NP measure for sufficiently
large systems. The present approach can be modified so as to agree with the NP
measure of contextuality on all consistently connected systems while extending
it to inconsistently connected systems.

  Link-Propagating Early Adopters",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a method of ranking recently created Twitter
accounts according to their prospective popularity. Early detection of new
promising accounts is useful for trend prediction, viral marketing, user
recommendation, and so on. New accounts are, however, difficult to evaluate
because they have not established their reputations, and we cannot apply
existing link-based or other popularity-based account evaluation methods. Our
method first finds ""early adopters"", i.e., users who often find new good
information sources earlier than others. Our method then regards new accounts
followed by good early adopters as promising, even if they do not have many
followers now. In order to find good early adopters, we estimate the frequency
of link propagation from each account, i.e., how many times the follow links
from the account have been copied by its followers. If its followers have
copied many of its follow links in the past, the account must be an early
adopter, who find good information sources earlier than its followers. We
develop a method of inferring which links are created by copying which links.
One advantage of our method is that our method only uses information that can
be easily obtained only by crawling neighbors of the target accounts in the
current Twitter graph. We evaluated our method by an experiment on Twitter
data. We chose then-new accounts from an old snapshot of Twitter, compute their
ranking by our method, and compare it with the number of followers the accounts
currently have. The result shows that our method produces better rankings than
various baseline methods, especially for new accounts that have only a few
followers.

by large polaron dynamics, a key component of electron-orbital coupling in a

to be witnessed in many practical scenarios. Theoretically, witnessing
entanglement is by measuring a special Hermitian observable, called
entanglement witness (EW), which has non-negative expected outcomes for all
separable states but can have negative expectations for certain entangled
states. In practice, an EW implementation may suffer from two problems. The
first one is \emph{reliability}. Due to unreliable realization devices, a
separable state could be falsely identified as an entangled one. The second
problem relates to \emph{robustness}. A witness may not to optimal for a target
state and fail to identify its entanglement. To overcome the reliability
problem, we employ a recently proposed measurement-device-independent
entanglement witness, in which the correctness of the conclusion is independent
of the implemented measurement devices. In order to overcome the robustness
problem, we optimize the EW to draw a better conclusion given certain
experimental data. With the proposed EW scheme, where only data postprocessing

crucial role in the network's evolutionary mechanisms and functional behaviors.
However, some network topologies are usually unknown or uncertain. Meanwhile,
coupling delay are ubiquitous in various man-made and natural networks. Hence,
it is necessary to gain knowledge of the whole or partial topology of a complex
dynamical network by taking into consideration communication delay. In this
paper, topology identification of complex dynamical networks is investigated
via generalized synchronization of a two-layer network. Particularly, based on
the LaSalle-type invariance principle of stochastic differential delay
equations, an adaptive control technique is proposed by constructing an
auxiliary layer and designing proper control input and updating laws so that
the unknown topology can be recovered upon successful generalized
synchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The technique provides a certain
theoretical basis for topology inference of complex networks. In particular,
when the considered network is composed of systems with high-dimension or
complicated dynamics, a simpler response layer can be constructed, which is
conducive to circuit design. Moreover, it is practical to take into
consideration perturbations caused by control input. Finally, the method is
applicable to infer topology of a subnetwork embedded within a complex system
and locate hidden sources. We hope the results can provide basic insight into

crucially affected by a perfectly conducting channel (PCC), which is stabilized

dimensionless conductance g of the system decreases to the quantized value of g
= 1 with increasing system length L. In the realistic case where intervalley
scattering is weak but not ignorable, the PCC is gradually destabilized with
increasing L, and g eventually decays to zero owing to the onset of Anderson
localization. Here, we show that such destabilization of the PCC can be relaxed
by pure dephasing. We numerically calculate g in the presence of long-range
impurities, which induce weak intervalley scattering, taking the dephasing
effect into account. It is demonstrated that, under sufficient dephasing, the

highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time
optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this
problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at
high rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the
optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial
measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion
constraints. Our first contribution is a \emph{preintegration theory} that
properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally
discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation
noise and derive the expression for the \emph{maximum a posteriori} state
estimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary
Jacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic
form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can
be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying
framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of
incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \emph{structureless} model
for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further
accelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our
monocular \VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm
that our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

state-dependent lower bounds which are trivial for certain states. We present a
general approach to deriving tight state-independent uncertainty relations for
qubit measurements that completely characterise the obtainable uncertainty
values. This approach can give such relations for any number of observables,
and we do so explicitly for arbitrary pairs and triples of qubit measurements.
We show how these relations can be transformed into equivalent tight entropic
uncertainty relations. More generally, they can be expressed in terms of any
measure of uncertainty that can be written as a function of the expectation
value of the observable for a given state.

expectations of higher data rate de- mands in wireless networks. In C-RAN, low
energy base stations (BSs) are deployed over a small geography and are allowed
to connect to the cloud via finite capacity backhaul links where the
information is processed. A conventional C-RAN, however, requires high capacity
backhaul links, since the requested files need to be transferred first from the
cloud to the BS before conveying them to the users. One approach to overcome
the limitations of the backhaul links is to introduce local storage caches at
the BSs, in which the popular files are stored locally in order to reduce the
load of the backhaul links. Furthermore, we utilize coded caching with the goal
to minimize the total network cost, i.e., the transmit power and the cost
associated with the backhaul links. The initial formulation of the optimization
problem for this model is non-convex. We first reformulate and then convexify
the problem through some relaxation techniques. In comparison to the uncoded
caching at the BSs, our results highlight the benefits associated with coded
caching and show that it decreases the backhaul cost.

searched radio frequencies at the Allen Telescope Array in California. No

an alternative technique for performing direct and fast polarimetric

Based on the instantaneous Stokes-Mueller formalism to describe the
high-frequency evolution of the DFDP beam intensity, we thoroughly analyze the
interaction of such a beam with birefringent, dichroic and depolarizing
samples. This allows us to confirm that orthogonality breaking is produced by
the sample diattenuation, whereas this technique is immune to both
birefringence and diagonal depolarization. We further analyze the robustness of
this technique when polarimetric sensing is performed through a birefringent
waveguide, and the optimal DFDP source configuration for fiber-based endoscopic
measurements is subsequently identified. Finally, we consider a stochastic
depolarization model based on an ensemble of random linear diattenuators, which
makes it possible to understand the progressive vanishing of the detected
orthogonality breaking signal as the spatial heterogeneity of the sample
increases, thus confirming the insensitivity of this method to diagonal
depolarization. The fact that the orthogonality breaking signal is exclusively
due to the sample dichroism is an advantageous feature for the precise
decoupled characterization of such an anisotropic parameter in samples showing
several simultaneous effects.

composition of repair masonry mortars is now being more frequently addressed in
mortar research. Just recently, for example, it has become apparent that
Portland cement mortars, extensively exploited as repair mortars over the past
few decades, are not suitable for repair because of their chemical, physical,
mechanical, and aesthetic incompatibilities with original materials. This paper
focuses on the performance of various lime-based alternative materials intended
for application in repairing historic structures when subjected to mechanical
loading. Results of basic material tests indicate that the use of metakaolin as
a pozzolanic additive produces mortars with superior strength and sufficiently
low shrinkage. Moreover, mortar strength can be further enhanced by the
addition of crushed brick fragments, which explains the longevity of Roman
concretes rich in pozzolans and aggregates from crushed clay products such as
tiles, pottery, or bricks. An integrated experimental-numerical approach was
used to identify key mortar parameters influencing the load-bearing capacity of
masonry piers subjected to a combination of compression and bending. The
simulations indicate increased load-bearing capacities for masonry piers
containing metakaolin-rich mortars with crushed brick fragments, as a result of
their superior compressive strength.

bursts. In 2003 and 2004 it experienced two outbursts in X-rays. We present
here an analysis of the system bursting properties during these outbursts. We
studied the evolution of the 2003-2004 outbursts in soft X-rays using RXTE
(2.5-12 keV; ASM), and in hard X-rays with INTEGRAL (17-80 keV, IBIS/ISGRI).
Using data from the JEM-X monitor onboard INTEGRAL we detected 61 Type-I X-ray
bursts, and confirm that the source displayed a quasi-periodic burst recurrence
time of about 2.3 hours. We improve the characterization of the fuel
composition, as well as the description of the typical burst durations and
fluences. We estimate the average value of $\alpha$ to be $49\pm\,3$. This
value together with the observed burst profiles indicate a regime of a mixed
He/H runaway triggered by unstable helium ignition. In addition, we report the
detection of four series of double bursts, with burst recurrence times of
$\leq\,20$ minutes. The measured recurrence time in double bursts is too short
to allow the accretion of enough fresh material, necessary to trigger a Type-I
X-ray burst. This suggests the presence of left-over, unburned material from
the preceding burst which gets ignited in a time scale of minutes. The energies
and time scales of the secondary bursts suggest a lower fraction of hydrogen
compared to that estimated for the primary bursts. The persistent emission was
roughly constant during the period when the Type I X-ray bursts were detected.
We derive an average accretion rate during our observations of
$\dot{m}\sim\,8\,\%\,\dot{m}_{Edd}$. The spectrum of the persistent emission
can be fit with a non-thermal component, indicative for the source to be in a
hard state when the INTEGRAL observations were performed.

migrated interior to the Earth's orbit in a late stage of nebula evolution. In
this late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU
from outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the
question why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass
being as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy
pebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line
assuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use
a simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and
radial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble
accretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions
presented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of
terrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the
strength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1
AU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while
turbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos
reside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023
wt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and
the snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation. If the
solar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved
into icy planets of 1-10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow.
If the proto-Earth contained water of ~ 1 wt% as might be suggested by the
density deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was
possible with weaker turbulence and with earlier (> 0.5-2 Myr) snow-line
migration.

forward and deforms into a thin sheet which eventually fragments. We study how
the drop deformation depends on the pulse shape and drop properties. We first
derive the velocity field inside the drop on the timescale of the pressure
pulse, when the drop is still spherical. This yields the kinetic-energy
partition inside the drop, which precisely measures the deformation rate with
respect to the propulsion rate, before surface tension comes into play. On the
timescale where surface tension is important the drop has evolved into a thin
sheet. Its expansion dynamics is described with a slender-slope model, which
uses the impulsive energy-partition as an initial condition. Completed with
boundary integral simulations, this two-stage model explains the entire drop
dynamics and its dependance on the pulse shape: for a given propulsion, a
tightly focused pulse results in a thin curved sheet which maximizes the
lateral expansion, while a uniform illumination yields a smaller expansion but
a flat symmetric sheet, in good agreement with experimental observations.

About 10 years ago this simple setting was instrumental in identifying a

exceeding a critical value. Building on earlier work, we assume that, for
supercritical currents, the optimal density profile, conditioned on the given
current, has the form of a traveling wave (TW). For the KMP model we find this
TW analytically, in terms of elliptic functions, for any supercritical current
$I$. Using this TW solution, we evaluate, up to a pre-exponential factor, the
probability distribution $P(I)$. We obtain simple asymptotics of the TW and of
$P(I)$ for currents close to the critical current, and for currents much larger
than the critical current. In the latter case we show that $-\ln P (I) \sim

between the amplitude of the wave and the depth of the water. We investigate in
this paper the convergence as epsilon goes to zero of the free surface Euler
equations to the so called rigid lid model. We first prove that the only
solutions of this model are zero. Due to the conservation of the Hamiltonian,
the solutions of the free surface Euler equations converge weakly to zero, but
not strongly in the general case, as epsilon goes to zero. We then study this
default of convergence. More precisely, we show a strong convergence result of
the solutions of the water waves equations in the Zakharov-Craig-Sulem
formulation to the solutions of the linear water-waves equations. It is then
easy to observe that these latter converge weakly to zero. The simple structure
of this system also allows us to explain the mechanisms of the weak convergence
to zero. Finally, we show that this convergence to the rigid lid model also
holds for the solutions of the Euler equations. To this end we give a new proof
of the equivalence of the free surface Euler equations and of the
Zakharov-Craig-Sulem equation by building an extension of the velocity and

reionization probably began around z ~ 12-15 and ended by z=6. In addition, a
careful analysis of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background
indicate a scattering optical depth tau ~ 0.066+/-0.012 through the EoR. In the
context of LCDM, galaxies at intermediate redshifts and dwarf galaxies at
higher redshifts now appear to be the principal sources of UV ionizing
radiation, but only for an inferred (ionizing) escape fraction f_ion ~ 0.2,
which is in tension with other observations that suggest a value as small as ~
0.05. In this paper, we examine how reionization might have progressed in the
alternative Friedmann-Robertson Walker cosmology known as the R_h=ct Universe,
and determine the value of f_ion required with this different rate of
expansion. We find that R_h=ct accounts quite well for the currently known
properties of the EoR, as long as its fractional baryon density falls within
the reasonable range 0.026 < Omega_b < 0.037. This model can also fit the EoR
data with f_ion ~ 0.05, but only if the Lyman continuum photon production is
highly efficient and Omega_b ~ 0.037. These results are still preliminary,
however, given their reliance on a particular form of the star-formation rate
density, which is still uncertain at very high redshifts. It will also be
helpful to reconsider the EoR in R_h=ct when complete structure formation
models become available.

production with low-energy photons severely attenuates emission of higher

relativity theory, of broad optical emission lines in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), a new method is proposed to estimate the virial factors $f$ in
measuring black hole masses $M_{\rm{RM}}$ by the reverberation mapping of AGNs.
The factors $f$ can be measured on the basis of two physical quantities, i.e.
the gravitational redshifts $z_{\rm{g}}$ and full widths at half maxima
$v_{\rm{FWHM}}$ of broad lines. In the past it has been difficult to determine
the factors $f$ for individual AGNs. We apply this new method to several
reverberation mapped Seyfert 1 galaxies. There is a correlation between $f$ and
broad-line region (BLR) radius $r_{\rm{BLR}}$, $f=5.4 r_{\rm{BLR}}^{0.3}$, for
the gravitationally redshifted broad lines He II, He I, H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$
in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) Mrk 110. This correlation results from
the radiation pressure influence of the accretion disc on the BLR clouds. The
radiation pressure influence seems to be more important than usually thought in
AGNs. Mrk 110 has $f \approx$ 8--16, distinctly larger than the mean $\langle
f\rangle \approx 1$, usually used to estimate $M_{\rm{RM}}$ in the case of
$v_{\rm{FWHM}}$. NGC 4593 and NLS1 Mrk 486 has $f\approx 3$ and $f\approx 9$,
respectively. Higher $f$ values of several tens are derived for three other
NLS1s. There is a correlation between $f$ and accretion rate $\mathscr{\dot
M}_{f=1}$, $f=6.8\mathscr{\dot M}^{0.4}_{f=1}$ for five objects, where
$\mathscr{\dot M}_{f=1}=\dot M_{\bullet}/L_{\rm{Edd}}c^{-2}$ as $f=1$ is
assumed to estimate $M_{\rm{RM}}$ used in the Eddington luminosity
$L_{\rm{Edd}}$, $\dot M_{\bullet}$ is the mass accretion rate, and $c$ is the
speed of light. These larger $f$ values will produce higher $M_{\rm{RM}}$
values and lower Eddington ratios.

interactions, in which metabolites excreted by some species are metabolised
further by others. The population dynamics of such ecosystems are governed by
frequency-dependent selection, which allows for stable coexistence of two or
more species. We have analysed a model of cross-feeding based on the replicator
equation, with the aim of establishing criteria for coexistence in ecosystems
containing three species, given the information of the three species' ability
to coexist in their three separate pairs, i.e. the long term dynamics in the
three two-species component systems. The triple-system is studied statistically
and the probability of coexistence in the species triplet is computed for two
models of species interactions. The interaction parameters are modelled either
as stochastically independent or organised in a hierarchy where any derived
metabolite carries less energy than previous nutrients in the metabolic chain.
We differentiate between different modes of coexistence with respect to the
pair-wise dynamics of the species, and find that the probability of coexistence
is close to $\frac12$ for triplet systems with three pair-wise coexistent pairs
and for so-called intransitive systems. Systems with two and one pair-wise
coexistent pairs are more likely to exist for random interaction parameters,
but are on the other hand much less likely to exhibit triplet coexistence.
Hence we conclude that certain species triplets are, from a statistical point
of view, rare, but if allowed to interact are likely to coexist. This knowledge
might be helpful when constructing synthetic microbial communities for
industrial purposes.

alternative to the very popular metallic split-ring structure proposed by

physics is the description of a lattice via breaking translational invariance
on the gravity side. By making use of global symmetries, it is possible to do
so without scarifying homogeneity of the pertinent bulk solutions, which we
thus term as ""homogeneous holographic lattices."" Due to their technical
simplicity, these configurations have received a great deal of attention in the
last few years and have been shown to correctly describe momentum relaxation
and hence (finite) DC conductivities. However, it is not clear whether they are
able to capture other lattice effects which are of interest in condensed
matter. In this paper we investigate this question focusing our attention on
the phenomenon of commensurability, which arises when the lattice scale is
tuned to be equal to (an integer multiple of) another momentum scale in the
system. We do so by studying the formation of spatially modulated phases in
various models of homogeneous holographic lattices. Our results indicate that
the onset of the instability is controlled by the near horizon geometry, which
for insulating solutions does carry information about the lattice. However, we
observe no sharp connection between the characteristic momentum of the broken
phase and the lattice pitch, which calls into question the applicability of
these models to the physics of commensurability.

well known but precisely how the individual cellular characteristics of those
cells collectively drive the emergence of robust, homeostatic structures is
less well understood. For example cell communication via a diffusible factor
allows for information to travel across large distances within the population,
and cell polarisation makes it possible to form structures with a particular
orientation, but how do these processes interact to produce a more robust and
regulated structure? In this study we investigate the ability of cells with
different cellular characteristics to grow and maintain homeostatic structures.
We do this in the context of an individual-based model where cell behaviour is
driven by an intra-cellular network that determines the cell phenotype. More
precisely, we investigated evolution with 96 different permutations of our
model, where cell motility, cell death, long-range growth factor (LGF),
short-range growth factor (SGF) and cell polarisation were either present or
absent. The results show that LGF has the largest positive impact on the
fitness of the evolved solutions. SGF and polarisation also contribute, but all
other capabilities essentially increase the search space, effectively making it
more difficult to achieve a solution. By perturbing the evolved solutions, we
found that they are highly robust to both mutations and wounding. In addition,
we observed that by evolving solutions in more unstable environments they
produce structures that were more robust and adaptive. In conclusion, our
results suggest that robust collective behaviour is most likely to evolve when
cells are endowed with long range communication, cell polarisation, and
selection pressure from an unstable environment.

duration of individual bursts at fixed frequency was ~100 ms, while the
instantaneous relative bandwidth was ~2%. Some bursts had measurable frequency
drift, positive or negative. Often spikes appeared in chains, which were
closely spaced in time (column chains) or in frequency (row chains). Column
chains had frequency drifts similar to IIId-bursts; most of the row chains
exhibited negative drifts similar to fiber bursts. From the NRH data, we found
that spikes were superimposed on a larger, slowly varying, background
component. They were polarized in the same sense as the background source, with
a slightly higher degree of polarization of ~65%, and their size was ~60% of
their size in total intensity. The duration and bandwidth distributions did not
show any clear separation in groups. Some chains tended to assume the form of
zebra, lace stripes, fibers, or bursts of the type-III family, suggesting that
such bursts might be resolved in spikes when viewed with high resolution. The

(CDDR), $D_L(z) / D_A(z) (1 + z)^{2} = 1$, where $D_A$ is the angular diameter
distance and $D_L$ is the luminosity distance to a given source at redshift
$z$, using strong gravitational lensing (SGL) and type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)
data. We show that the ratio $D=D_{A_{12}}/D_{A_2}$ and
$D^{*}=D_{L_{12}}/D_{L_{2}}$, where the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond,
respectively, to redshifts $z_1$ and $z_2$, are linked by $D/D^*=(1+z_1)^2$ if
the CDDR is valid. We allow departures from the CDDR by defining two funcions
for $\eta(z_1)$, which equals unity when the CDDR is valid. We find that
combination of SGL and SNe Ia data favours no violation of the CDDR at
1$\sigma$ confidence level ($\eta(z) \simeq 1$), in complete agreement with
other tests and reinforcing the theoretical pillars of the CDDR.

Gaussian copula regression that achieve the same performance without the

regression. Using a Kendall's tau based covariance matrix estimator, an
$\ell_1$ regularized estimator is proposed and a corresponding de-biased
estimator is developed for the construction of the confidence intervals and
hypothesis tests. Theoretical properties of the procedures are studied and the
proposed estimation and inference methods are shown to be adaptive to the
unknown monotone marginal transformations. Prediction of the response for a
given value of the covariates is also considered. The procedures are easy to
implement and perform well numerically. The methods are also applied to analyze
the Communities and Crime Unnormalized Data from the UCI Machine Learning

Blume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice. We perform simulations for the
critical isotherm, the low temperature phase at vanishing external field and,
for comparison, also the high temperature phase. For the connected two-point
function a substantial reduction of the variance can be obtained, allowing us
to compute the correlation length with high precision. Based on these results,
estimates for various universal amplitude ratios that characterise the
universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model are computed.

and Vasserot, provides a systematic method to analyse the instanton partition
functions of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In this paper, we
rewrite the SH$^c$ algebra in terms of three holomorphic fields $D_0(z)$,
$D_{\pm1}(z)$ with which the algebra and its epresentations are simplified. The
instanton partition functions for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills
theories with $A_n$ and $A^{(1)}_n$ type quiver diagrams are compactly
expressed as a product of four building blocks: Gaiotto state, dilatation,
flavor vertex operator and intertwiner which are written in terms of SH$^c$ and
the orthogonal basis introduced by Alba, Fateev, Litvinov and Tarnopolskiy.
These building blocks are characterized by new conditions which generalize the
known ones on the Gaiotto state and the Carlsson-Okounkov vertex. Consistency
conditions of the inner product give algebraic relations for the chiral ring
generating functions defined by Nekrasov, Pestun and Shatashvili. In particular
we show the polynomiality of the qq-characters which have been introduced as a
deformation of the Yangian characters. These relations define a second
quantization of the Seiberg-Witten geometry, and, accordingly, reduce to a
Baxter TQ-equation in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the Omega-background.

through quasi-two-dimensional hoppers. The first experiment uses oil-in-water
emulsion droplets in a thin sample chamber. Due to surfactants coating the

disks. For these droplets, clogging at the hopper exit requires a narrow hopper
opening only slightly larger than the droplet diameter. The second experiments
use soft hydrogel particles in a thin sample chamber, where we vary gravity by
changing the tilt angle of the chamber. For reduced gravity, clogging becomes
easier, and can occur for larger hopper openings. Our simulations mimic the
emulsion experiments and demonstrate that softness is a key factor controlling
clogging: with stiffer particles or a weaker gravitational force, clogging is
easier. The fractional amount a single particle is deformed under its own
weight is a useful parameter measuring particle softness. Data from the
simulation and hydrogel experiments collapse when compared using this
parameter. Our results suggest that prior studies using hard particles were in
a limit where the role of softness is negligible which causes clogging to occur

to perform simulations at a higher resolution than has been done in the context
of aneurysms before. The high space-time resolutions of 8{\mu}m and 0.11 {\mu}s
resulted in nearly one billion cells and 9 million time steps per second and

Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the layers. Energy and
momentum conservation results in a single resonant peak in the tunnel
conductance between two 2D layers as has been experimentally observed for two
quantum wells (QW) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. The account for SOI in the
layers leads to a complex pattern in the tunneling characteristic with typical
features corresponding to SOI energy. For this manifestation of SOI to be
observed experimentally the characteristic energy should exceed the resonant
broadening related to the particles quantum lifetime in the layers. We perform
an accurate analysis of the known experimental data on electron and hole 2D-2D
tunneling in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures. It appears that for the electron
tunneling the manifestation of SOI is difficult to observe, but for the holes
tunneling the parameters of the real structures used in the experiments are
very close to those required by the resolution criteria. We also consider a new
promising candidate for the effect to be observed, that is p-doped SiGe
strained heterostructures. The reported parameters of cubic Rashba SOI and
quantum lifetime in strained Ge QWs fabricated up to date already match the
criteria for observing SOI in 2D-2D heavy holes tunneling. As supported by our
calculations small adjustments of the parameters for AlGaAs/GaAs p-type QWs or
simply designing a 2D-2D tunneling experiment for SiGe case are very likely to

polynomial kernelization for the equivalent version where $S$ is a set of
edges. In a first step we show that Edge Subset Feedback Vertex Set has a
randomized polynomial kernel parameterized by $|S|+k$ with $O(|S|^2k)$
vertices. For this we use the matroid-based tools of Kratsch and Wahlstr\""om
(FOCS '12) that for example were used to obtain a polynomial kernel for
$s$-Multiway Cut. Next we present a preprocessing that reduces the given
instance $(G,S,k)$ to an equivalent instance $(G',S',k')$ where the size of
$S'$ is bounded by $O(k^4)$. These two results lead to a polynomial kernel for
Subset Feedback Vertex Set with $O(k^9)$ vertices.

divergence of order $\alpha \in (0, \infty)$ on $\alpha$-convex sets. The
forward projection on such a set is motivated by some works of Tsallis {\em et
al.} in statistical physics, and the reverse projection is motivated by robust
statistics. In a recent work, van Erven and Harremo\""es proved a Pythagorean
inequality for R\'{e}nyi divergences on $\alpha$-convex sets under the
assumption that the forward projection exists. Continuing this study, a
sufficient condition for the existence of forward projection is proved for
probability measures on a general alphabet. For $\alpha \in (1, \infty)$, the
proof relies on a new Apollonius theorem for the Hellinger divergence, and for
$\alpha \in (0,1)$, the proof relies on the Banach-Alaoglu theorem from
functional analysis. Further projection results are then obtained in the finite
alphabet setting. These include a projection theorem on a specific
$\alpha$-convex set, which is termed an {\em $\alpha$-linear family},
generalizing a result by Csisz\'ar for $\alpha \neq 1$. The solution to this
problem yields a parametric family of probability measures which turns out to
be an extension of the exponential family, and it is termed an {\em
$\alpha$-exponential family}. An orthogonality relationship between the
$\alpha$-exponential and $\alpha$-linear families is established, and it is
used to turn the reverse projection on an $\alpha$-exponential family into a
forward projection on a $\alpha$-linear family. This paper also proves a
convergence result of an iterative procedure used to calculate the forward
projection on an intersection of a finite number of $\alpha$-linear families.

different measurement scenarios on the basis of the resulting post-measurement
states and the according probabilities for finding a particular work value. In
particular, we analyze a recently proposed work-meter for the case of a
Gaussian pointer state and compare it with the results obtained by two
projective and, alternatively, two Gaussian measurements. In the limit of a
strong effective measurement strength the work distribution of projective two
energy measurements can be recovered. In the opposite limit the average of work
becomes independent of any measurement. Yet the fluctuations about this value

desiderata one would demand of a model to serve as the foundation for a
statistical analysis of real-world networks. The class of random graphs is
defined by a probabilistic symmetry: invariance of the distribution of each
graph to an arbitrary relabelings of its vertices. In particular, following
Caron and Fox, we interpret a symmetric simple point process on
$\mathbb{R}_+^2$ as the edge set of a random graph, and formalize the
probabilistic symmetry as joint exchangeability of the point process. We give a
representation theorem for the class of random graphs satisfying this symmetry
via a straightforward specialization of Kallenberg's representation theorem for
jointly exchangeable random measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^2$. The distribution of
every such random graph is characterized by three (potentially random)
components: a nonnegative real $I \in \mathbb{R}_+$, an integrable function $S:
\mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+$, and a symmetric measurable function $W:
\mathbb{R}_+^2 \to [0,1]$ that satisfies several weak integrability conditions.
We call the triple $(I,S,W)$ a graphex, in analogy to graphons, which
characterize the (dense) exchangeable graphs on $\mathbb{N}$. Indeed, the model
we introduce here contains the exchangeable graphs as a special case, as well
as the ""sparse exchangeable"" model of Caron and Fox. We study the structure of
these random graphs, and show that they can give rise to interesting structure,
including sparse graph sequences. We give explicit equations for expectations
of certain graph statistics, as well as the limiting degree distribution. We
also show that certain families of graphexes give rise to random graphs that,
asymptotically, contain an arbitrarily large fraction of the vertices in a
single connected component.

amino acid sequences can be achieved via the knowledge of the score
distribution of random sequences. But this requires obtaining the distribution
in the biologically relevant high-scoring region, where the probabilities are
exponentially small. For gapless local alignments of infinitely long sequences
this distribution is known analytically to follow a Gumbel distribution.
Distributions for gapped local alignments and global alignments of finite
lengths can only be obtained numerically. To obtain result for the
small-probability region, specific statistical mechanics-based rare-event
algorithms can be applied. In previous studies, this was achieved for pairwise
alignments. They showed that, contrary to results from previous simple sampling
studies, strong deviations from the Gumbel distribution occur in case of finite
sequence lengths. Here we extend the studies to the for practical applications
in Molecular Biology much more relevant case of multiple sequence alignments
with gaps. We study the distributions of scores over a large range of the
support, reaching probabilities as small as 10^-160, for global and local
(sum-of-pair scores) multiple alignments. We find that even after suitable
rescaling, eliminating the sequence-length dependence, the distributions for
multiple alignment differ from the pairwise alignment case. Furthermore, we
also show that the previously discussed Gaussian correction to the Gumbel
distribution needs to be refined, also for the case of pairwise alignments.

information enabling the reconstruction of a three dimensional image of an
object by illumination and scattering of a coherent beam of light, and the
image is generated at the same wavelength as the input laser beam. In recent
years it was shown that information can be stored in nanometric antennas giving
rise to ultrathin components. Here we demonstrate nonlinear multi-layer
metamaterial holograms where by the nonlinear process of Third Harmonic
Generation, a background free image is formed at a new frequency which is the
third harmonic of the illuminating beam. Using e-beam lithography of multilayer
plasmonic nanoantennas, we fabricate polarization-sensitive nonlinear elements
such as blazed gratings, lenses and other computer-generated holograms. These
holograms are analyzed and prospects for future device applications are
discussed.

Hamiltonian with diagonal and off-diagonal disorder consistent with spectral
and structural studies, we analyze excitonic localization and spectral
statistics of the chlorosomes. A size-dependent localization-delocalization
crossover is found to occur as a function of the excitonic energy. The
crossover energy region coincides with the more optically active states with
maximized superradiance, and is, consequently, more conducive for energy
transfer.

  arXiv:1511.03494",,,,"nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Solvable supersymmetric algebraic model for descriptions of the spherical to
gama unstable shape- phase transition in even and odd mass nuclei is proposed.
This model is based on dual algebraic structure and Richardson - Gaudin method,
where the duality relations between the unitary and quasispin algebraic
structures for the boson and fermion systems are extended to mixed boson-
fermion system. The structure of two type of nuclear supersymmetry schemes,
based on the U(6/2) and U(6/4) supergroups, is discussed. We investigate the
change in level structure induced by the phase transition by doing a quantal
analysis. By using the generalized quasispin algebra, it is shown that the
nuclear supersymmetry concept can be also used for transitional regions in
addition to dynamical symmetry limits. Experimental evidence for the U(5)-O(6)
transition in Ru-Rh and Zn- Cu supermultiplets is presented. The low-states
energy spectra and B(E2)values for these nuclei have been calculated and
compared with the experimental data.

induced by the impact of a grain on two types of granular beds, namely,
randomly packed and FCC-structured beds.Good correspondence is obtained between
our numerical results and the findings of previous experiments, and it is
demonstrated that the packing structure of the granular bed strongly affects
the splash process.The mean ejection angle for the randomly packed bed is
consistent with previous experimental results. The FCC-structured bed yields a
larger mean ejection angle; however, the latter result has not been confirmed
experimentally. Furthermore, the ejection angle distributions and the vertical
ejection speeds for individual grains vary depending on the relative timing at
which the grains are ejected after the initial impact. Obvious differences are
observed between the distributions of grains ejected during the earlier and
later splash periods: the form of the vertical ejection speed distribution
varies from a power-law form to a lognormal form with time, and more than 80\%
of the kinetic energy of all ejected grains is used for earlier ejected grains.

be used for high-level algorithm development as well as low-level device driver
implementations for accurate simulation of wireless sensor networks before
deployment. However, in a simulation Cooja assumes that the nodes are only
equipped with omnidirectional antennas. There is currently no support for
directional antennas. Due to the growing interest in the use of directional or
smart antennas in wireless sensor networks, a model that can support
directional antennas is essential for the realistic simulations of protocols
relying on directional communication. This paper presents work on extending
COOJA with a directional antenna model.
