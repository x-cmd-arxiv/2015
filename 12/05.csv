turbulence with respect to two local, physically relevant directions: along the
local mean magnetic field and along the local direction of one of the
fluctuating Elsasser fields. We find significant scaling anisotropy with
respect to both these directions: the fluctuations are ""ribbon-like"" ---
statistically, they are elongated along both the mean magnetic field and the
fluctuating field. The latter form of anisotropy is due to scale-dependent
alignment of the fluctuating fields. The intermittent scalings of the
$n$th-order conditional structure functions in the direction perpendicular to
both the local mean field and the fluctuations agree well with the theory of
Chandran et al. 2015, while the parallel scalings are consistent with those
implied by the critical-balance conjecture. We quantify the relationship
between the perpendicular scalings and those in the fluctuation and parallel
directions, and find that the scaling exponent of the perpendicular anisotropy
(i.e., of the aspect ratio of the Alfv\'enic structures in the plane
perpendicular to the mean magnetic field) depends on the amplitude of the
fluctuations. This is shown to be equivalent to the anticorrelation of
fluctuation amplitude and alignment at each scale. The dependence of the
anisotropy on amplitude is shown to be more significant for the anisotropy
between the perpendicular and fluctuation-direction scales than it is between
the perpendicular and parallel scales.

invariant whose study started two decades ago. The distinguishing number $D(H)$
is the least integer $d$ such that $H$ has a $d$-distinguishing coloring. A
$d$-distinguishing coloring is a coloring $c:V(H)\rightarrow\{1,\dots,d\}$
invariant only under the trivial automorphism. In this paper, we continue the
study of a game variant of this parameter, recently introduced. The
distinguishing game is a game with two players, Gentle and Rascal, with
antagonist goals. This game is played on a graph $H$ with a fixed set of
$d\in\mathbb N^*$ colors. Alternately, the two players choose a vertex of $H$
and color it with one of the $d$ colors. The game ends when all the vertices
have been colored. Then Gentle wins if the coloring is $d$-distinguishing and
Rascal wins otherwise. This game defines two new invariants, which are the
minimum numbers of colors needed to ensure that Gentle has a winning strategy,
depending who starts the game. The invariant could eventually be infinite. In
this paper, we focus on cartesian product, a graph operation well studied in
the classical case. We give sufficient conditions on the order of two connected
factors $H$ and $F$ relatively prime, which ensure that one of the game
distinguishing numbers of the cartesian product $H\square F$ is finite. If $H$
is a so-called involutive graph, we give an upper bound of order $D^2(H)$ for
one of the game distinguishing numbers of $H\square F$. Finally, using in part
the previous result, we compute the exact value of these invariants for
cartesian products of relatively prime cycles. It turns out that the value is
either infinite or equal to $2$, depending on the parity of the product order.

every 33 months. In order to monitor the eclipse of 2015, AAVSO Alert Notice

for a cosmological analysis based on galaxy clusters in a photometric survey.
In this paper we aim to quantify the capability of the correlation function of
galaxy cluster to constrain the intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\ln M}$. We
demonstrate how the linear bias measured in the correlation function of
clusters can be used to determine the value of this parameter. The new method
is tested in simulations of a $5, 000 deg^2$ optical survey up to $z \sim 1$,
similar to the ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES). Our results show that our
method works better at lower scatter values. We can measured the intrinsic
scatter $\sigma_{ln M} = 0.1$ with a standard deviation of $\sigma(\sigma_{ln
M}) \sim 0.03$ using this technique. However, the expected intrinsic scatter of
the DES RedMaPPer cluster catalog $\sigma_{ln M} \sim 0.2$ cannot be recovered
with this method at suitable accuracy and precision because the area coverage
is insufficient. For future photometric surveys with a larger area such as LSST
and Euclid, the statistical errors will be reduced. Therefore, we forecast
higher precision to measure the intrinsic scatter including the value mention
before. We conclude that this method can be used as an internal consistency
check method on their simplifying assumptions and complementary to
cross-calibration techniques in multi-wavelength cluster observations

in spherical geometry, \`a la van der Waals. Pascal's law is recovered within
the Landau-Ginzburg density functional theory, formally analogously to how
conservation of energy is recovered in the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics.
We establish proper boundary conditions for certain singular functional forms
of the bulk free energy density that allow one to obtain droplet solutions with
thick walls in essentially closed form. The hydrodynamic modes responsible for
mixing near the interface are explicitly identified in the treatment; the
composition at the interface is found to depend only weakly on the droplet
size. Next we develop a Landau-Ginzburg treatment of the effects of amphiphiles
on the surface tension; the amphiphilic action is seen as a violation of
Pascal's law. We explicitly obtain the binding potential for the detergent at
the interface and the dependence of the down-renormalization of the surface
tension on the activity of the detergent. Finally, we argue that the
renormalization of the activation barrier for escape from long-lived structures

oriented amphiphilic molecules on the interface separating two dissimilar
aperiodic structures. This renormalization is also considered as a ""wetting"" of

transient regime of a simple example population dynamics. These effects play an
important role for the numerical determination of large deviation functions of
additive observables for stochastic processes. A method commonly used in order
to determine such functions is the so-called cloning algorithm which in its
non-constant population version essentially reduces to the determination of the
growth rate of a population, averaged over many realizations of the dynamics.
However, the averaging of populations is highly dependent not only on the
number of realizations of the population dynamics, and on the initial
population size but also on the cut-off time (or population) considered to stop
their numerical evolution. This may result in an over-influence of discreteness
effects at initial times, caused by small population size. We overcome these
effects by introducing a (realization-dependent) time delay in the evolution of
populations, additional to the discarding of the initial transient regime of
the population growth where these discreteness effects are strong. We show that
the improvement in the estimation of the large deviation function comes
precisely from these two main contributions.

net dc flow of vortices in the same direction as the ac drive. Here we show
that when the ac drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry
direction, it is possible to realize a transverse ratchet effect where a net dc
flow of vortices is generated perpendicular to the ac drive. The conformal
transverse ratchet effect is distinct from previous versions of transverse
ratchets in that it occurs due to the generation of non-Gaussian transverse
vortex velocity fluctuations by the plastic motion of vortices, so that the
system behaves as a noise correlation ratchet. The transverse ratchet effect is
much more pronounced in the conformal arrays than in random gradient arrays,
and is absent in square gradient arrays due the different nature of the vortex
flow in each geometry. We show that a series of reversals can occur in the
transverse ratchet effect due to changes in the vortex flow across the pinning
gradient as a function of vortex filling, pinning strength, and ac amplitude.
We also consider the case where a dc drive applied perpendicular to the
substrate asymmetry direction generates a net flow of vortices perpendicular to
the dc drive, producing a geometric or drift ratchet that arises due to
non-Gaussian dynamically generated fluctuations. The drift ratchet is more
efficient than the ac driven ratchet and also exhibits a series of reversals

This equation arises in the work of Degond and Ringhofer on the derivation of
quantum hydrodynamical models from first principles. Their theory consists in
transposing to the quantum setting the closure strategy by entropy minimization
used for kinetic equations. The starting point is the quantum Liouville-BGK
equation, where the collision term is defined via a so-called quantum local
equilibrium, defined as a minimizer of the quantum free energy under a local
density constraint. We then address three related problems: we prove new
results about the regularity of these quantum equilibria; we prove that the
quantum Liouville-BGK equation admits a classical solution; and we investigate
the long-time behavior of the solutions. The core of the proofs is based on a
fine analysis of the properties of the minimizers of the free energy.

placed in oscillating background flows. Recent experiments on inanimate
pyramid-shaped objects in oscillating flows with zero mean component
demonstrate that the resulting aerodynamic forces are sufficient to keep the
object aloft. The mechanisms responsible for this lift production are
fundamentally unsteady and depend on the shed vorticity. Here, we consider a
model system of a two-dimensional flyer and compute the unsteady, two-way
coupling between the flyer and the surrounding fluid in the context of the
vortex sheet model. We examine in detail the flow properties (frequency and
speed) required for hovering and their dependence on the flyer's
characteristics (mass and geometry). We find that the aerodynamic effort
required to hover is an intrinsic property of the flyer itself: a given flyer
requires a constant amount of effort to hover, irrespective of the frequency
and speed of the oscillating flow. This physical insight will potentially have
significant implications on the design of unmanned air vehicles as well as on
understanding active hovering of live organisms that can manipulate their
flapping motion to favor a larger oscillation amplitude or frequency.

distributions. Continuous field proxies for human settlements, agriculture and
forest cover have similar spatial scaling properties spanning 4 to 5 orders of
magnitude. Progressive segmentation of these continuous fields yields spatial
networks with rank-size distributions having slopes near -1 for a wide range of
thresholds. We consider a general explanation for this scaling that does not
require different processes for each type of land cover. The same conditions
that give rise to scale-free networks in general can produce power law
distributions of component sizes for bounded spatial networks confined to a
plane or surface. Progressive segmentation of a continuous field naturally
results in growth of the network while the increasing perimeters of the growing
components result in preferential attachment to the larger components with the
longer perimeters. Progressive segmentation of two types of random continuous
field results in progressions of growing spatial networks with components that
achieve unity power law rank-size distributions immediately before explosive
percolation occurs. This suggests that the scaling properties and uniform area
distribution implied by a unity power law rank-size distribution may be a
general characteristic of bounded spatial networks produced by segmenting some
continuous fields. The implication is that different process-specific
mechanisms may not be required to explain the rank-size distributions observed
for the diversity of land cover products described here.

compression process, including instability and disintegration of targets. The
non-uniformity of the leading edge of the liner, caused by plasma jets as well

Past two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that the

changes into a chain of plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets, and
the averaged reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of the Lundquist
number. In this work, three-dimensional simulation with a guide field shows
that the additional degree of freedom allows plasmoid instabilities to grow at
oblique angles, which interact and lead to self-generated turbulent
reconnection. The averaged reconnection rate in the self-generated turbulent
state is of the order of a hundredth of the characteristic Alfv\'en speed,
which is similar to the two-dimensional result but is an order of magnitude
lower than the fastest reconnection rate reported in recent studies of
externally driven three-dimensional turbulent reconnection. Kinematic and
magnetic energy fluctuations both form elongated eddies along the direction of
local magnetic field, which is a signature of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence. Both energy fluctuations satisfy power-law spectra in the inertial
range, where the magnetic energy spectral index is in the range from $-2.3$ to
$-2.1$, while the kinetic energy spectral index is slightly steeper, in the
range from $-2.5$ to $-2.3$. The anisotropy of turbulence eddies is found to be

An existing visualization technique that is particularly well suited to
visualizing large datasets is the heatmap. Although heatmaps are extremely
popular in fields such as bioinformatics for visualizing large gene expression
datasets, they remain a severely underutilized visualization tool in modern
data analysis. In this paper we introduce superheat, a new R package that
provides an extremely flexible and customizable platform for visualizing large
datasets using extendable heatmaps. Superheat enhances the traditional heatmap
by providing a platform to visualize a wide range of data types simultaneously,
adding to the heatmap a response variable as a scatterplot, model results as
boxplots, correlation information as barplots, text information, and more.
Superheat allows the user to explore their data to greater depths and to take
advantage of the heterogeneity present in the data to inform analysis
decisions. The goal of this paper is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the potential
of the heatmap as a default visualization method for a wide range of data types
using reproducible examples, and (2) to highlight the customizability and ease
of implementation of the superheat package in R for creating beautiful and

manipulation actions. The introduced formalism leads to semantics of
manipulation action and has applications to both observing and understanding
human manipulation actions as well as executing them with a robotic mechanism
(e.g. a humanoid robot). It is based on a Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The
goal of the introduced framework is to: (1) represent manipulation actions with
both syntax and semantic parts, where the semantic part employs
$\lambda$-calculus; (2) enable a probabilistic semantic parsing schema to learn
the $\lambda$-calculus representation of manipulation action from an annotated
action corpus of videos; (3) use (1) and (2) to develop a system that visually
observes manipulation actions and understands their meaning while it can reason
beyond observations using propositional logic and axiom schemata. The
experiments conducted on a public available large manipulation action dataset
validate the theoretical framework and our implementation.

smooth, increasing, convex nonlinearity such that $ f(0) > 0 $ and which blows
up at $ a_{f} $. Let $$0<\tau_{-}:=\liminf_{t\rightarrow a_{f}}

$\alpha^{*}$ is the largest root of the equation $$(2-\tau_{-})^{2} \alpha^{4}-

if $\tau_{-}=\tau_{+}:=\tau$, then $\sup_{m}
||u_{m}||_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}<a_{f}$ for $n\leq12$ when $\tau\leq 1$, and for
$n\leq7$ when $\tau\leq 1.57863$. These estimates lead to the regularity of the

$u^{*}(x)=\lim_{\lambda\uparrow\lambda^{*}}u_{\lambda}(x),$ where $\lambda^*$

comprise production of massive gauge bosons, jets, charged hadrons and pions.
This is the first time a study of nuclear PDFs includes this number of
different observables. The goal of the paper is twofold: i) checking the
description of the data by nPDFs, as well as the relevance of these nuclear
effects, in a quantitative manner; ii) testing the constraining power of these
data in eventual global fits, for which we use the Bayesian reweighting
technique. We find an overall good, even too good, description of the data,
indicating that more constraining power would require a better control over the
systematic uncertainties and/or the proper proton-proton reference from LHC Run
II. Some of the observables, however, show sizable tension with specific
choices of proton and nuclear PDFs. We also comment on the corresponding
improvements on the theoretical treatment.

1.7\times 10^{38}$~erg/s to its luminosity at an epoch at which it was
undetected. Combined with other recent measurements, this confirms that the
source X-ray emission has been highly variable during the last 15 years,
ranging from a maximum of $10^{40}$ erg/s through intermediate values $\sim$ a
few $\times 10^{39}$ erg/s, and down to a minimum that must be below the
current detection threshold $\sim (2-3) \times 10^{38}$ erg/s . We interpret
these results by means of a magnetically-threaded disk model: when at peak
luminosity, the neutron star (NS) is close to spin equilibrium, its inner disk
edge r_m ~ 10^8 cm is approximately half the corotation radius r_{co}, and
radiation pressure dominates the disk out to r_{tr} ~ 10^9 cm. In the radiation
pressure-dominated regime, r_m grows very slowly as the mass inflow rate drops:
as a result, r_m < r_{co} remains valid until the mass accretion rate becomes ~
the Eddington accretion rate, allowing a wide range of accretion luminosities
to the NS. Once the mass accretion rate is below Eddington, accretion onto the
NS is inhibited because r_m > r_{co}, and the source luminosity is expected to
drop by a large factor. We conclude that a magnetically threaded, radiation
pressure-dominated disk, around a highly magnetized NS (B~10^{13} G) offers the
best intepretation for all the currently observed properties of NuSTAR
J095551+6940.8. This source offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the
disk-magnetosphere interaction in a new regime of supercritical accretion, and
across the transition between-radiation pressure and gas-pressure dominance

log g, [M/H], and elemental abundances. This method was implemented in a new
code, SP_Ace (Stellar Parameters And Chemical abundances Estimator). This is a
highly automated code suitable for analyzing the spectra of large spectroscopic
surveys with low or medium spectral resolution (R=2,000-20,000). Methods: After
the astrophysical calibration of the oscillator strengths of 4643 absorption
lines covering the wavelength ranges 5212-6860\AA\ and 8400-8924\AA, we
constructed a library that contains the equivalent widths (EW) of these lines
for a grid of stellar parameters. The EWs of each line are fit by a polynomial
function that describes the EW of the line as a function of the stellar
parameters. The coefficients of these polynomial functions are stored in a
library called the ""$GCOG$ library"". SP_Ace, a code written in FORTRAN95, uses
the GCOG library to compute the EWs of the lines, constructs models of spectra
as a function of the stellar parameters and abundances, and searches for the
model that minimizes the $\chi^2$ deviation when compared to the observed
spectrum. The code has been tested on synthetic and real spectra for a wide
range of signal-to-noise and spectral resolutions. Results: SP_Ace derives
stellar parameters such as Teff, log g, [M/H], and chemical abundances of up to
ten elements for low to medium resolution spectra of FGK-type stars with
precision comparable to the one usually obtained with spectra of higher
resolution. Systematic errors in stellar parameters and chemical abundances are
presented and identified with tests on synthetic and real spectra. Stochastic
errors are automatically estimated by the code for all the parameters. A simple
Web front end of SP_Ace can be found at http://dc.g-vo.org/SP_ACE, while the
source code will be published soon.

negligible effects may become important in the reconstruction of the PSF, in
part because of the improved spatial resolution. In this paper, we show that
unresolved multiple star systems can affect the ellipticity and size of the PSF
and that this effect is not cancelled even when using many stars in the
reconstruction process. We estimate the error in the reconstruction of the PSF
due to the binaries in the star sample both analytically and with image
simulations for different PSFs and stellar populations. The simulations support
our analytical finding that the error on the size of the PSF is a function of
the multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of the
PSF, i.e. if all stars were single. Similarly, the modification of each of the
complex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiple
stars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity. Using image simulations, we
also show that the predicted error in the PSF shape is a theoretical limit that
can be reached only if large number of stars (up to thousands) are used
together to build the PSF at any desired spatial position. For a lower number
of stars, the PSF reconstruction is worse. Finally, we compute the effect of
binarity for different stellar magnitudes and show that bright stars alter the
PSF size and ellipticity more than faint stars. This may affect the design of
PSF calibration strategies and the choice of the related calibration fields.

parameters are considered. The models cover the full temperature extent of the
classical instability strip, but are limited in luminosity; for the most
luminous models violent pulsation leads to the decoupling of the outermost
model shell. Hence, our survey reaches only the shortest period RV Tau domain.
  In the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram we detect two domains in which period
doubled pulsation is possible. The first extends through the BL Her domain and
low luminosity W Vir domain (pulsation periods ~2-6.5 d). The second domain
extends at higher luminosities (W Vir domain; periods >9.5d). Some models
within these domains display period-4 pulsation. We also detect very narrow
domains (~10 K wide) in which modulation of pulsation is possible. Another
interesting phenomenon we detect is double-mode pulsation in the fundamental
mode and in the fourth radial overtone. Fourth overtone is a surface mode,
trapped in the outer model layers. Single-mode pulsation in the fourth overtone
is also possible on the hot side of the classical instability strip. The origin
of the above phenomena is discussed. In particular, the role of resonances in
driving different pulsation dynamics as well as in shaping the morphology of

shock invariably forms ahead of the magnetosphere, but the pre-shock gas is
only mildly supersonic (with typical Mach numbers of $\simeq$1.6-1.8) so the
shock is weak. This results in a characteristic signature in the ultraviolet
light curve: a broad absorption feature that leads the optical transit by
10-20% in orbital phase. The shapes of our synthetic light-curves are
consistent with existing observations of WASP-12b, but the required near-UV
optical depth ($\tau \sim 0.1$) can only be achieved if the shocked gas cools
rapidly. We further show that radiative cooling is inefficient, so we deem it
unlikely that a magnetospheric bow shock is responsible for the observed
near-UV absorption. Finally, we apply our model to two other well-studied hot
Jupiters (WASP-18b and HD209458b), and suggest that UV observations of more

studies of chemical abundance trends in old Milky Way halo stars suggested
continual r-process production, in sites like core-collapse supernovae. But
evidence from the local Universe favors r-process production mainly during rare
events, such as neutron star mergers. The appearance of a europium abundance
plateau in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies has been suggested as evidence for
rare r-process enrichment in the early Universe, but only under the assumption
of no gas accretion into the dwarf galaxies. Cosmologically motivated gas
accretion favors continual r-process enrichment in these systems. Furthermore,
the universal r-process pattern has not been cleanly identified in dwarf
spheroidals. The smaller, chemically simpler, and more ancient ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies assembled shortly after the first stars formed, and are ideal
systems with which to study nucleosynthesis events such as the r-process.
Reticulum II is one such galaxy. The abundances of non-neutron-capture elements
in this galaxy (and others like it) are similar to those of other old stars.
Here, we report that seven of nine stars in Reticulum II observed with
high-resolution spectroscopy show strong enhancements in heavy neutron-capture
elements, with abundances that follow the universal r-process pattern above
barium. The enhancement in this ""r-process galaxy"" is 2-3 orders of magnitude
higher than that detected in any other ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. This implies
that a single rare event produced the r-process material in Reticulum II. The
r-process yield and event rate are incompatible with ordinary core-collapse
supernovae, but consistent with other possible sites, such as neutron star
mergers.

that the IceCube high-energy neutrino data provide indirect constraints on the

The analysis shows that proto-cluster regions are dominated by central galaxies
and their number decreases with time as many become satellites, clustering
around the central object. In agreement with observations, we find an
increasing velocity dispersion with cosmic time, the increase being faster for
satellites. The analysis shows that proto-clusters are very extended regions,
$\gtrsim 20 \, Mpc$ at $z \gtrsim 1$. The fraction of galaxies in proto-cluster
regions that are not progenitor of cluster galaxies varies with redshift,
stellar mass and area considered. It is about 20-30 per cent for galaxies with
stellar mass $\sim 10^9\,{\rm M}_{\sun}$, while negligible for the most massive
galaxies considered. Nevertheless, these objects have properties similar to
those of progenitors. We investigate the building-up of the passive-sequence in
clusters, and find that their progenitors are on average always active at any
redshift of interest of proto-clusters. The main mechanism which quenches their
star formation is the removal of the hot gas reservoir at the time of
accretion. The later galaxies are accreted (become satellite), and the more the
cold gas available, the longer the time spent as active. Central galaxies are
active over all redshift range considered, although a non-negligible fraction
of them become passive at redshift $z<1$, due to strong feedback from Active

hole. We consider both timelike and null geodesics which are confined to the
black hole's equatorial plane. Such geodesics generically exist if the
distortion field has only even interior multipole moments and so the field is
symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. We specialize to the case of
distortions defined by a quadrupole Weyl moment. An analysis of the effective
potential for equatorial timelike geodesics shows that finite stable orbits
outside the black hole are possible only for $q\in(q_{\text{min}},
q_{\text{max}}]$, where $q_{\text{min}}\approx-0.0210$ and
$q_{\text{max}}\approx2.7086\times10^{-4}$, while for null equatorial geodesics
a finite stable orbit outside the black hole is possible only for
$q\in[q_{\text{min}},0)$. Moreover, the innermost stable circular orbits
(ISCOs) are closer to the distorted black hole horizon than those of an
undistorted Schwarzschild black hole for $q\in(q_{\text{min}},0)$ and a null
ISCO exists for $q=q_{\text{min}}$. These results shows that an external
distortion of a negative and sufficiently small quadrupole moment tends to
stabilize motion of massive particles and light.

readout technology, typically suffer from electrical crosstalk between the
pixels. The interpixel capacitance (IPC) responsible for the crosstalk affects
the point-spread function (PSF) of the telescope, increasing the size and
modifying the shape of all objects in the images while correlating the Poisson
noise. Upcoming weak lensing surveys that use these detectors, such as WFIRST,
place stringent requirements on the PSF size and shape (and the level at which
these are known), which in turn must be translated into requirements on IPC. To
facilitate this process, we present a first study of the effect of IPC on
WFIRST PSF sizes and shapes. Realistic PSFs are forward-simulated from physical
principles for each WFIRST bandpass. We explore how the PSF size and shape
depends on the range of IPC coupling with pixels that are connected along an
edge or corner; for the expected level of IPC in WFIRST, IPC increases the PSF
sizes by $\sim$5\%. We present a linear fitting formula that describes the
uncertainty in the PSF size or shape due to uncertainty in the IPC, which could
arise for example due to unknown time evolution of IPC as the detectors age or
due to spatial variation of IPC across the detector. We also study of the
effect of a small anisotropy in the IPC, which further modifies the PSF shapes.
Our results are a first, critical step in determining the hardware and
characterization requirements for the detectors used in the WFIRST survey.

mutually exclusive in the sense that a group having both properties is compact.
This is no longer true for more general Polish groups. However, a weaker result
still holds for SIN groups (topological groups admitting a basis of
conjugation-invariant neighbourhoods of identity): if such a group admits
sufficiently many unitary representations, then it is precompact as soon as it
is amenable and has the strong property (T) (i.e. admits a finite Kazhdan set).
If an amenable topological group with property (T) admits a faithful uniformly
continuous representation, then it is maximally almost periodic. In particular,
an extremely amenable SIN group never has strong property (T), and an extremely
amenable subgroup of unitary operators in the uniform topology is never a

Relativity coupled to the Maxwell field in three spacetime dimensions is
analyzed. Although the fall-off of the fields is relaxed with respect to that
of Brown and Henneaux, the variation of the canonical generators associated to
the asymptotic Killing vectors can be shown to be finite once required to span
the Lie derivative of the fields. The corresponding surface integrals then
acquire explicit contributions from the electromagnetic field, and become
well-defined provided they fulfill suitable integrability conditions, implying
that the leading terms of the asymptotic form of the electromagnetic field are
functionally related. Consequently, for a generic choice of boundary
conditions, the asymptotic symmetries are broken down to $\mathbb{R}\otimes
U\left(1\right)\otimes U\left(1\right)$. Nonetheless, requiring compatibility
of the boundary conditions with one of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetries,
singles out the set to be characterized by an arbitrary function of a single
variable, whose precise form depends on the choice of the chiral copy.
Remarkably, requiring the asymptotic symmetries to contain the full conformal
group selects a very special set of boundary conditions that is labeled by a
unique constant parameter, so that the algebra of the canonical generators is
given by the direct sum of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with the standard
central extension and $U\left(1\right)$. This special set of boundary
conditions makes the energy spectrum of electrically charged rotating black
holes to be well-behaved.

screening resulting from the lack of centro-symmetry, large spin splitting and
spin valley locking in hole doped systems. The key ingredients are i) valley
dependent spin-momentum locking perpendicular to the two dimensional crystal;
ii) single nondegenerate Fermi surface per valley, and iii) nontrivial Berry
curvature associated with the low energy bands. The resulting Kondo resonance
has a finite triplet component and nontrivial momentum space structure which
facilitates new approaches to both probe and manipulate the correlated state.
Using a variational wave function and the numerical renormalization group
approaches we study the nature of the Kondo resonance both in the absence and
presence of circularly polarized light. The latter induces an imbalance in the

weaker than the ""conformal collider"" constraints of Hofman and Maldacena. We

to the positivity of 2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor, which
follows from unitarity. Our calculations are performed using momentum-space

presence of a soluble surfactant (or a surface active solute) is studied. The
fluids have different viscosities, but are density matched to focus on
Marangoni effects. The fluids flow between two flat plates, which are
maintained at different solute concentrations. This establishes a constant flux
of solute from one fluid to the other in the base state. A linear stability
analysis is performed, using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods.
In the creeping flow regime, Marangoni stresses destabilize the flow, provided
a concentration gradient is maintained across the fluids. One long wave and two
short wave Marangoni instability modes arise, in different regions of parameter
space. A well-defined condition for the long wave instability is determined in
terms of the viscosity and thickness ratios of the fluids, and the direction of
mass transfer. Energy budget calculations show that the Marangoni stresses that
drive long and short wave instabilities have distinct origins. The former is
caused by interface deformation while the latter is associated with convection
by the disturbance flow. Consequently, even when the interface is non-deforming
(in the large interfacial tension limit), the flow can become unstable to short
wave disturbances. On increasing $Re$, the viscosity-induced interfacial
instability comes into play. This mode is shown to either suppress or enhance
the Marangoni instability, depending on the viscosity and thickness ratios.
This analysis is relevant to applications such as solvent extraction in
microchannels, in which a surface-active solute is transferred between fluids
in parallel stratified flow. It is also applicable to the thermocapillary
problem of layered flow between heated plates.

resulting in the chloroplast and the subsequent development of all complex
photosynthetic organisms. The ciliate Paramecium bursaria and the alga
Chlorella have a well established and well studied light dependent
endosymbiotic relationship. Despite its prominence there remain many unanswered
questions regarding the exact mechanisms of the photosymbiosis. Of particular
interest is how a host maintains and manages its symbiont load in response to
the allocation of nutrients between itself and its symbionts. Here we construct
a detailed mathematical model, parameterised from the literature, that
explicitly incorporates nutrient trading within a deterministic model of both
partners. The model demonstrates how the symbiotic relationship can manifest as
parasitism of the host by the symbionts, mutualism, wherein both partners
benefit, or exploitation of the symbionts by the hosts. We show that the
precise nature of the photosymbiosis is determined by both environmental
conditions (how much light is available for photosynthesis) and the level of
control a host has over its symbiont load. Our model provides a framework
within which it is possible to pose detailed questions regarding the
evolutionary behaviour of this important example of an established light
dependent endosymbiosis; we focus on one question in particular, namely the
evolution of host control, and show using an adaptive dynamics approach that a
moderate level of host control may evolve provided the associated costs are not

filtering can be used to recognize pile-up, it suffers errors due to
pulse-shape variation from detector nonlinearity, readout dependence on

single band optical light curve comprising at least a few tens of observations
covering durations from weeks to years, with arbitrary time sampling. We use
light curves of periodic variable stars taken from OGLE and EROS-2 to train the
model. To make our classifier relatively survey-independent, it is trained on
16 features extracted from the light curves (e.g. period, skewness, Fourier
amplitude ratio). The model classifies light curves into one of seven
superclasses - Delta Scuti, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, Type II Cepheid, eclipsing
binary, long-period variable, non-variable - as well as subclasses of these,
such as ab, c, d, and e types for RR Lyraes. When trained to give only
superclasses, our model achieves 0.98 for both recall and precision as measured
on an independent validation dataset (on a scale of 0 to 1). When trained to
give subclasses, it achieves 0.81 for both recall and precision. In order to
assess classification performance of the subclass model, we applied it to the
MACHO, LINEAR, and ASAS periodic variables, which gave recall/precision of
0.92/0.98, 0.89/0.96, and 0.84/0.88, respectively. We also applied the subclass
model to Hipparcos periodic variable stars of many other variability types that
do not exist in our training set, in order to examine how much those types
degrade the classification performance of our target classes. In addition, we
investigate how the performance varies with the number of data points and
duration of observations. We find that recall and precision do not vary
significantly if the number of data points is larger than 80 and the duration
is more than a few weeks. The classifier software of the subclass model is
available from the GitHub repository (https://goo.gl/xmFO6Q).

spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we
appropriately define availability? Step-selection analysis deals with this
problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each used
step (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set
of available steps randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or
their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach,
termed integrated step-selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit
assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their
temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA
relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource-selection parameters,
thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a
mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as
well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations,
we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to
currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general,
flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological
hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.

layer has an extremely strong controllability in spite of its scale-free

the controllability is robust against targeted attacks to critical nodes but
vulnerable to random failures, which also differs from normal scale-free
networks. The multi-chain structure with a small number of chain roots arising
from each layer accounts for the strong controllability and the abnormal
feature. The multiplex congruence network offers a graphical solution to the
simultaneous congruences problem, which may have implication in cryptography
based on simultaneous congruences. Our work also gains insight into the design

show that our Bayesian test for heteroskedasticity (BTH) outperforms classical
tests for differences in variation across a large range of simulations drawn

methylation QTL study data and expression QTL study data to identify variance

developed to select a subset of covariates to associate with a response

analysis due to enormous possibilities of such selections. How can we know
statistically our discoveries better than those by chance? In this paper, we
define a measure of goodness of spurious fit, which shows how good a response
variable can be fitted by an optimally selected subset of covariates under the
null model, and propose a simple and effective LAMM algorithm to compute it. It
coincides with the maximum spurious correlation for linear models and can be
regarded as a generalized maximum spurious correlation. We derive the
asymptotic distribution of such goodness of spurious fit for generalized linear
models and $L_1$ regression. Such an asymptotic distribution depends on the
sample size, ambient dimension, the number of variables used in the fit, and
the covariance information. It can be consistently estimated by multiplier
bootstrapping and used as a benchmark to guard against spurious discoveries. It
can also be applied to model selection, which considers only candidate models
with goodness of fits better than those by spurious fits. The theory and method
are convincingly illustrated by simulated examples and an application to the
binary outcomes from German Neuroblastoma Trials.

fluctuations, ""gaps"", along its length as a test of the LCDM prediction of
large numbers of dark matter sub-halos orbiting in the halo. Density variations
of some form are present, since the variance of the density along the stream is
three times that expected from the empirically estimated variation in the
filtered mean star counts. The density variations are characterized with
filters that approximate the shape of sub-halo gravitationally induced stream
gaps. The filters locate gaps and measures their amplitude, leading to a
measurement of the distribution of gap widths. To gain understanding of the
factors influencing the gap width distribution, a suite of collisionless n-body
simulations for a GD-1 like orbit in a Milky Way-like potential provides a
dynamically realistic statistical prediction of the gap distribution. The
simulations show that every location in the stream has been disturbed to some
degree by a sub-halo. The small gaps found via the filtering are largely noise.
Larger gaps, those longer than 1 kpc, or 10 degrees for GD-1, are the source of
the excess variance. The suite of stream simulations shows that sub-halos at
the predicted inner halo abundance or possibly somewhat higher can produce the
required large sale density variations.

describes a family of sets over a universe of size n and the task is to
determine whether the family contains at least one set. Our approach is based
on ""monotone local search"", where the goal is to extend a partial solution to a
solution by adding as few elements as possible. More formally, in the extension
problem we are also given as input a subset X of the universe and an integer k.
The task is to determine whether one can add at most k elements to X to obtain
a set in the (implicitly defined) family. Our main result is that an O*(c^k)
time algorithm for the extension problem immediately yields a randomized
algorithm for finding a solution of any size with running time O*((2-1/c)^n).
  In many cases, the extension problem can be reduced to simply finding a
solution of size at most k. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for finding small
solutions have been extensively studied in the field of parameterized
algorithms. Directly applying these algorithms, our theorem yields in one
stroke significant improvements over the best known exponential-time algorithms

security scenarios were often modeled via different types of games and analyzed
in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we propose an algebraic approach for
modeling and analyzing uniformly several types of network security games. This
approach is based on a probabilistic extension of the value-passing Calculus of
Communicating Systems (CCS) which is regarded as a Generative model for
Probabilistic Value-passing CCS (PVCCSG for short). Our approach gives a
uniform framework, called PVCCSG based security model, for the security
scenarios modeled via perfect and complete or incomplete information games. We
present then a uniform algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria strategies
of a network security game on its PVCCSG based security model. The algorithm
first generates a transition system for each of the PVCCSG based security
models, then simplifies this transition system through graph-theoretic
abstraction and bisimulation minimization. Then, a backward induction method,
which is only applicable to finite tree models, can be used to compute all the
Nash equilibria strategies of the (possibly infinite) security games. This
algorithm is implemented and can also be tuned smoothly for computing its
social optimal strategies. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach
are further demonstrated with four detailed case studies from the field of
network security.

statistics. In many situations, we wish to require that the sparsity patterns
attained honor certain problem-specific constraints. Hierarchical sparse
modeling (HSM) refers to situations in which these constraints specify that one
set of parameters be set to zero whenever another is set to zero. In recent
years, numerous papers have developed convex regularizers for this form of
sparsity structure, which arises in many areas of statistics including
interaction modeling, time series analysis, and covariance estimation. In this
paper, we observe that these methods fall into two frameworks, the group lasso
(GL) and latent overlapping group lasso (LOG), which have not been
systematically compared in the context of HSM. The purpose of this paper is to
provide a side-by-side comparison of these two frameworks for HSM in terms of
their statistical properties and computational efficiency. We call special
attention to GL's more aggressive shrinkage of parameters deep in the
hierarchy, a property not shared by LOG. In terms of computation, we introduce
a finite-step algorithm that exactly solves the proximal operator of LOG for a
certain simple HSM structure; we later exploit this to develop a novel
path-based block coordinate descent scheme for general HSM structures. Both
algorithms greatly improve the computational performance of LOG. Finally, we
compare the two methods in the context of covariance estimation, where we
introduce a new sparsely-banded estimator using LOG, which we show achieves the
statistical advantages of an existing GL-based method but is simpler to express
and more efficient to compute.

adaptive quantum state tomography (RAQST) protocol for finite dimensional

on two-qubit systems. In this RAQST protocol, an adaptive measurement strategy
and a recursive linear regression estimation algorithm are performed. Numerical
results show that our RAQST protocol can outperform the tomography protocols
using mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and the two-stage MUB adaptive strategy
even with the simplest product measurements. When nonlocal measurements are
available, our RAQST can beat the Gill-Massar bound for a wide range of quantum
states with a modest number of copies. We use only the simplest product
measurements to implement two-qubit tomography experiments. In the experiments,
we use error-compensation techniques to tackle systematic error due to
misalignments and imperfection of wave plates, and achieve about 100-fold
reduction of the systematic error. The experimental results demonstrate that
the improvement of RAQST over nonadaptive tomography is significant for states
with a high level of purity. Our results also show that this recursively
adaptive tomography method is particularly effective for the reconstruction of
maximally entangled states, which are important resources in quantum
information.

vortices, we work in the ordinary symmetry-breaking Higgs potential, while for
the case of monopoles we have the ordinary condition of the Prasad-Sommerfield

present solutions for BPS vortices with higher winding number. These solutions
suffer from the condition that $w(|\phi|)$ has negative value at some finite

incorporate latent temporal structure into the deep model, accounting for large
temporal variations of diverse human activities. In particular, we utilize the
latent variables to decompose the input activity into a number of temporally
segmented sub-activities, and accordingly feed them into the parts (i.e.
sub-networks) of the deep architecture}. Second, we incorporate a radius-margin
bound as a regularization term into our deep model, which effectively improves
the generalization performance for classification. For model training, we
propose a principled learning algorithm that iteratively (i) discovers the
optimal latent variables (i.e. the ways of activity decomposition) for all
training instances, (ii) { updates the classifiers} based on the generated

by their hydrodynamic interaction as they are forced through a viscous fluid in
the limit of zero Reynolds number. It is well known that in the case of two
rigid spheres in an unbounded fluid, the hydrodynamic interaction does not
produce relative translation. More generally such an effective pair-interaction
vanishes in configurations with spatial inversion symmetry; for example, an
enantiomorphic pair in mirror image positions has no relative translation. We
show that the breaking of inversion symmetry by boundaries of the system
accounts for the interactions between two spheres in confined geometries, as
observed in experiments. The same general principle also provides new
predictions for interactions in other object configurations near obstacles. We
examine the time-dependent relative translation of two self-aligning objects,
extending the numerical analysis of our preceding publication [Goldfriend,
Diamant and Witten, Phys. Fluids 27, 123303 (2015)]. The interplay between the
orientational interaction and the translational one, in most cases, leads over
time to repulsion between the two objects. The repulsion is qualitatively
different for self-aligning objects compared to the more symmetric case of
uniform prolate spheroids. The separation between the two objects increases
with time $t$ as $t^{1/3}$ in the former case, and more strongly, as $t$, in
the latter.

Temperature-dependent NMR shift $K(T)$, which is a direct measure of the
intrinsic spin susceptibility, agrees very well with the spin-1/2
alternating-chain model, justifying the assignment of the spin lattice. From
the analysis of $K(T)$, magnetic exchange parameters were estimated as follows:
the leading exchange $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 38.4$ K, alternation ratio $\alpha =
J'/J \simeq 0.68$, and spin gap $\Delta/k_{\rm B} \simeq 15$ K. The transferred
hyperfine coupling between the $^{75}$As nucleus and V$^{4+}$ spins obtained by
comparing the NMR shift with bulk susceptibility amounts to $A_{\rm hf} \simeq
3.3$ T/$\mu_{\rm B}$. Our temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_1(T)$ also shows an activated behaviour at low temperatures, thus
confirming the presence of a spin gap in AgVOAsO$_4$.

by the flow of a conducting medium in the limit of vanishing backaction of the
fields onto the flow. The KD is therefore an important model system for
understanding astrophysical magnetism. Here, the mathematical correspondence
between the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed
from the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is
discussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate
SDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be
applied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the
fast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic
flows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive
KD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and
the dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This
supersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the
concept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the
diffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being
chaotic is given in either case. The observed exponentially growing and
oscillating KD modes prove physically that dynamical spectra of the STS
evolution operator that break the topological supersymmetry exist with both,
real and complex ground state eigenvalues. Finally, we comment on the
non-existence of dynamos for scalar quantities.

We use the modified version of the Gadget-2 code, a three-dimensional
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulation, to follow the evolution of the
collapsing gas in both idealized as well as more realistic minihalos. We find
that, despite the lack of any initial turbulence and magnetic fields in the

that has been reported in studies that employed fully self-consistent
cosmological initial conditions. The fit of the power-law appears to be roughly
constant regardless of the initial rotation of the cloud. We conclude that the
specific angular momentum of the self-gravitating rotating gas in the
primordial minihalos maintains a scaling relation with the gas mass as $L
\propto M^{1.125}$. We also discuss the plausible mechanisms for the power-law

further generalization of functional calculus. Considering such sheaves

  Intuitively, these structures capture the commutative aspects of C*-algebra
theory. In order to find a complete reaxiomatization of unital C*-algebras
within this language, we introduce almost C*-algebras as piecewise C*-algebras
equipped with a notion of inner automorphisms in terms of a self-action. We
provide some evidence for the conjecture that the forgetful functor from unital
C*-algebras to almost C*-algebras is fully faithful, and ask whether it is an
equivalence of categories. We also develop an analogous notion of almost group,
and prove that the forgetful functor from groups to almost groups is not full.
  In terms of quantum physics, our work can be seen as an attempt at a
reconstruction of quantum theory from physically meaningful axioms, as realized

down-conversion using normal modes of motion in a system of two Yb ions. The
nonlinearity is induced by the intrinsic anharmonicity of the Coulomb
interaction between the ions and can be used to simulate fully quantum
operation of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator. We exploit this
interaction to directly measure the parity and Wigner functions of ion motional
states. The nonlinear coupling, combined with near perfect control of internal
and motional states of trapped ions, can be applied to quantum computing,
quantum thermodynamics, and even shed some light on the quantum information
aspects of Hawking radiation.

focus on functions belonging to some weighted $ L^2 $ space whose fractional
Laplacian belongs to another weighted $ L^2 $ space: we prove and disprove the
validity of the integration-by-parts formula depending on the behaviour of the
weight $ \rho(x) $ at infinity. The latter is assumed to be like a power both
near the origin and at infinity (the two powers being possibly different). Our
results have direct consequences for the self-adjointness of the linear

braking of pulsars. 222 pulsars and 15 magnetars have abnormal distribution of
frequency second derivatives, which also make contradiction with classical
understanding. How neutron star magnetospheric activities affect these two
phenomena are investigated by using the wind braking model of pulsars. It is
based on the observational evidence that pulsar timing is correlated with
emission and both aspects reflect the magnetospheric activities. Fluctuations
are unavoidable for a physical neutron star magnetosphere. Young pulsars have
meaningful braking indices, while old pulsars' and magnetars' fluctuation item
dominates their frequency second derivatives. It can explain both the braking
index and frequency second derivative of pulsars uniformly. The braking indices
of eight pulsars are the combined effect of magnetic dipole radiation and
particle wind. During the life time of a pulsar, its braking index will evolve
from three to one. Pulsars with low braking index may put strong constraint on
the particle acceleration process in the neutron star magnetosphere. The effect
of pulsar death should be considered during the long term rotational evolution
of pulsars. An equation like the Langevin equation for Brownian motion was
derived for pulsar spin-down. The fluctuation in the neutron star magnetosphere
can be either periodic or random, which result in anomalous frequency second
derivative and they have similar results. The magnetospheric activities of
magnetars are always stronger than those of normal pulsars.

result in care disruption, sleep deprivation, and insensitivity of care-givers

through improving the quality of physiological signals by filtering, and
developing more accurate sensors. However, significant intrinsic correlation
among the extracted features limits the performance of most currently available
data mining techniques, as they often discard the predictors with low
individual impact that may potentially have strong discriminatory power when
grouped with others. We propose a model based on coalition game theory that
considers the inter-features dependencies in determining the salient predictors

The superior performance of this method compared to current methods is shown in

provide conjectural rationality and characterization of vanishing for families

The cancellations responsible do not happen degree by degree or even for degree
bounds for primes or prime powers, so rather than finite fields being
responsible, interaction between all finite field extensions seems to be
playing a role and thus suggests some interesting symmetries in the
distribution of prime polynomials. Primes are subtle, so whether there is
actual vanishing of these sums indicating surprising symmetry (as guessed
optimistically), or whether these sums just have surprisingly large valuations
