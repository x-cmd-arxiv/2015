angular momentum curves were refined by fitting to the experimental frequencies
and experimentally derived energies available in the literature. Using our
refined model we could (i) reassign the vibronic states for a large portion of
the experimentally derived energies [van Groenendael A., Tudorie M., Focsa C.,
Pinchemel B., Bernath P. F., 2005, J. Mol. Spectrosc., 234, 255], (ii) extended
this list of energies to $J=79-118$ and (iii) suggest a new description of the
resonances from the \A--\X\ system. We used high level \textit{ab initio}
electric dipole moments reported previously [Khalil H., Brites V., Le Quere F.,
Leonard C., 2011, Chem. Phys., 386, 50] to compute the Einstein A coefficients.
Our work is the first fully coupled description of this system. Our line list
is the most complete catalogue of spectroscopic transitions available for
$^{40}$Ca$^{16}$O and is applicable for temperatures up to at least 5000~K. CaO
has yet to be observed astronomically but its transitions are characterised by
being particularly strong which should facilitate its detection. The CaO line

inference techniques, we also define the sampling-based semantics of a term as
a function from a trace of random samples to a value. We show that the

implementation technique of trace Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for our
calculus and to show its correctness. A key step is defining sufficient
conditions for the distribution induced by trace MCMC to converge to the

discusses their implications. They were obtained in a unique environment for
studying QCD matter at temperatures and densities that exceed the limits
wherein hadrons can exist as individual entities and raises to prominence the
quark-gluon degrees of freedom. These findings are supported by major
experimental observations via measuring of the bulk properties of particle
production, particle ratios and chemical freeze-out conditions, and elliptic
flow; followed by hard probe measurements. The results reveal that a dense,
strongly-interacting medium is created in central Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV
at RHIC. This revelation of a new state of nuclear matter has also been
observed in measurements at the LHC. Further, the IP-Glasma model coupled with
viscous hydrodynamic models, which assumes the formation of a QGP, reproduces
well the experimental flow results from Au+Au at 200 GeV. This implies that the
fluctuations in the initial geometry state are important and the created medium
behaves as a nearly perfect liquid of nuclear matter because it has an
extraordinarily low ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. However, these
discoveries are far from being fully understood. Furthermore, recent
experimental results from RHIC and LHC in small p+A, d+Au and He+A collision
systems provide brand new insight into the role of initial and final state
effects. These have proven to be interesting and more surprising than
originally anticipated; and could conceivably shed new light in our
understanding of collective behavior in heavy-ion physics. Accordingly, the
focus of the experiments at both facilities RHIC and the LHC is on detailed
exploration of the properties of this new state of nuclear matter, the QGP.

substitute for the full 3D hydrodynamical models.
  We tested whether the results obtained using these simplified schemes (i.e.,

profiles, computed using 3D/1D NLTE/LTE approaches.

methodologies differ only slightly in most of the models at solar metallicity.
However, the line strengths predicted with the 3D NLTE and 3D+NLTE approaches
become significantly different at subsolar metallicities. At [M/H]=-2.0, this
may lead to (3D NLTE)-(3D+NLTE) differences in the predicted lithium abundance
of ~0.46 and ~0.31 dex in the TO and RGB stars, respectively. On the other
hand, NLTE line strengths computed with the average <3D> and 1D model

MS, TO, SGB, and RGB stars, at all metallicities; 3D-<3D> and 3D-1D differences
in the predicted abundances are always less than ~0.04 dex and ~0.08 dex,

dimensional particle trajectories in real time using precise space and time
information of the hits. Recent developments in silicon pixel detectors
achieved 150 ps time resolution and intense R&D is in progress to improve the
timing performance, aiming at 10 ps. The use of the precise space and time
information allows the suppression of background hits not compatible with the
time of passage of the particle and the determination of its time evolution.
The fast track finding device that we are proposing is based on a massively
parallel algorithm implemented in commercial field-programmable gate array
using a pipelined architecture. We describe the algorithm and its
implementation for a tracking system prototype based on 8 planes of silicon
sensors used as a case study. According to simulations the suppression of noise
hits is effective in reducing fake track combinations and improving real-time
track reconstruction in presence of background hits. The system provides
offline-like tracks with sub-microsecond latency and it is capable to determine
the time of the track with picosecond resolution assuming 10 ps resolution for
the hits.

estimated, as well as the angle of the polarization vector. We obtain that the

of polarization of gamma-rays detected in galactic black holes without the need
of a relativistic jet; specific predictions are made for sources in a low-hard

algorithm that selects the on/off combinations and timing of a finite set of
dynamic electric loads on the basis of short term predictions of the power
delivery from a photovoltaic source. In the algorithm for optimal scheduling,
each load is modeled with a dynamic power profile that may be different for on
and off switching. Optimal scheduling is achieved by the evaluation of a
user-specified criterion function with possible power constraints. The
scheduling algorithm exploits the use of a moving finite time horizon and the
resulting finite number of scheduling combinations to achieve real-time
computation of the optimal timing and switching of loads. The moving time
horizon in the proposed optimal scheduling algorithm provides an opportunity to
use short term (time moving) predictions of solar power based on advection of
clouds detected in sky images. Advection, persistence, and perfect forecast
scenarios are used as input to the load scheduling algorithm to elucidate the
effect of forecast errors on mis-scheduling. The advection forecast creates
less events where the load demand is greater than the available solar energy,
as compared to persistence. Increasing the decision horizon leads to increasing
error and decreased efficiency of the system, measured as the amount of power
consumed by the aggregate loads normalized by total solar power. For a
standalone system with a real forecast, energy reserves are necessary to
provide the excess energy required by mis-scheduled loads. A method for battery
sizing is proposed for future work.

of the data matrix are realizations of independent and identically distributed
random vectors. Such an assumption will be met, for example, if the rows of the
data matrix are multivariate measurements on a set of independently sampled
units. In the absence of an independent random sample, a relevant question is
whether or not a statistical model that assumes such row exchangeability is
plausible. One method for assessing this plausibility is a statistical test of
row covariation. Maintenance of a constant type I error rate regardless of the
column covariance or matrix mean can be accomplished with a test that is
invariant under an appropriate group of transformations. In the context of a
class of elliptically contoured matrix regression models (such as matrix normal
models), I show that there are no non-trivial invariant tests if the number of
rows is not sufficiently larger than the number of columns. Furthermore, I show
that even if the number of rows is large, there are no non-trivial invariant
tests that have power to detect arbitrary row covariance in the presence of
arbitrary column covariance. However, we can construct biased tests that have
power to detect certain types of row covariance that may be encountered in

disk or not, different X-ray emission properties can be found. The accretion
shocks produce cool heating of the plasma, contributing to the soft X-ray
emission from the star. Using X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultra-deep
Project and accretion rates that were obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope/WFPC2 photometric measurements in the Orion Nebula Cluster, we
studied the relation between the accretion processes and the X-ray emissions of
a coherent sample of T Tauri sources in the region. We performed regression and
correlation analyses of our sample of T Tauri stars between the X-ray
parameters, stellar properties, and the accretion measurements. We find that a
clear anti-correlation is present between the residual X-ray luminosity and the
accretion rates in our samples in Orion that is consistent with that found on
the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus molecular cloud (XEST) study. We
provide a catalog with X-ray luminosities (corrected from distance) and
accretion measurements of an Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) T Tauri stars sample.
Although Orion and Taurus display strong differences in their properties (total
gas and dust mass, star density, strong irradiation from massive stars), we
find that a similar relation between the residual X-ray emission and accretion
rate is present in the Taurus molecular cloud and in the accreting samples from
the Orion Nebula Cluster. The spread in the data suggests dependencies of the
accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities other than the stellar mass, but the
similarity between Orion and Taurus hints at the environment not being one of
them. The anti-correlation between the residual X-ray luminosity and mass
accretion rate is inherent to the T Tauri stars in general, independent of
their birthplace and environment, and intrinsic to early stellar evolution.

to reveal structural characteristics of the surface. For the in situ

dimensional accuracy. Several techniques are used to validate and calibrate
dimensional accuracy through the complete building envelope. The validation
process involves the growing and measuring of a shape with known parameters.
The measured result is compared with the intended digital model. Processes with
the risk of deformation after time or post processing may find this technique
beneficial. We propose to use objects from algebraic geometry as test shapes. A
cubic surface is given as the zero set of a 3rd degree polynomial with 3
variables. A class of cubics in real 3D space contains exactly 27 real lines.
We provide a library for the computer algebra system Singular which, from 6
given points in the plane, constructs a cubic and the lines on it. A surface
shape derived from a cubic offers simplicity to the dimensional comparison
process, in that the straight lines and many other features can be analytically
determined and easily measured using non-digital equipment. For example, the
surface contains so-called Eckardt points, in each of which three of the lines
intersect, and also other intersection points of pairs of lines. Distances
between these intersection points can easily be measured, since the points are
connected by straight lines. At all intersection points of lines, angles can be
verified. Hence, many features distributed over the build volume are known
analytically, and can be used for the validation process. Due to the thin shape
geometry the material required to produce an algebraic surface is minimal. This
paper is the first in a series that proposes the process chain to first define
a cubic with a configuration of lines in a given print volume and then to
develop the point cloud for the final manufacturing. Simple measuring
techniques are recommended.

prove that our algorithm converges almost surely to an unbiased estimate of the

convergence, and formally characterize its differential privacy properties. We
show that the optimal choice of our design parameters (with respect to the

provide cues for possible groupings of nodes, at various scales, in the CRFs to
encourage adaptive, high-order groups for more effective labeling. Our model is
dynamic and continuously exchanges information during inference: the local CRFs
influence what supervoxels in the hierarchy are active, and these active nodes
influence the connectivity in the CRF; we hence call it a grouping process
model. The experimental results on a recent large-scale video dataset show a
large margin of 60% relative improvement over the state of the art, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the dynamic, bidirectional flow between

Lagrangian, whose field equations are irreducibly of fourth order and are known
to admit asymptotically locally flat black holes endowed with gravitational
hair. The first class corresponds to a Kerr-Schild deformation of Minkowski
spacetime along a covariantly constant null vector. As in the case of General
Relativity, the field equations linearize so that the solution can be easily
shown to be described by four arbitrary functions of a single null coordinate.
These solutions can be regarded as a new sort of pp-waves. The second class is
obtained from a deformation of the static asymptotically locally flat black
hole, that goes along the spacelike (angular) Killing vector. Remarkably,
although the deformation is not of Kerr-Schild type, the field equations also
linearize, and hence the generic solution can be readily integrated. It is
neither static nor spherically symmetric, being described by two integration
constants and two arbitrary functions of the angular coordinate. In the static
case it describes ""black flowers"" whose event horizons break the spherical
symmetry. The generic time-dependent solution appears to describe a graviton
that moves away from a black flower. Despite the asymptotic behaviour of these
solutions at null infinity is relaxed with respect to the one for General
Relativity, the asymptotic symmetries coincide. However, the algebra of the
conserved charges corresponds to BMS$_{3}$, but devoid of central extensions.
The ""dynamical black flowers"" are shown to possess a finite energy. The surface
integrals that define the global charges also turn out to be useful in the

  In general case conditions for local continuity of the Holevo quantity for
discrete and continuous ensembles are found. Winter's type tight continuity
bound for the Holevo quantity under constraint on the average energy of
ensembles is obtained and applied to the system of quantum oscillators.

supervoxel algorithms, including both off-line and streaming methods, in the

uniformity, object/region boundary detection, region compression and parsimony.
For the evaluation we propose a comprehensive suite of seven quality metrics to
measure these desirable supervoxel characteristics. In addition, we evaluate
the methods in a supervoxel classification task as a proxy for subsequent
high-level uses of the supervoxels in video analysis. We use six existing
benchmark video datasets with a variety of content-types and dense human
annotations. Our findings have led us to conclusive evidence that the
hierarchical graph-based (GBH), segmentation by weighted aggregation (SWA) and
temporal superpixels (TSP) methods are the top-performers among the seven
methods. They all perform well in terms of segmentation accuracy, but vary in
regard to the other desiderata: GBH captures object boundaries best; SWA has
the best potential for region compression; and TSP achieves the best
undersegmentation error.

dynamically strained by longitudinal and transverse standing waves with various
frequencies, which span a wide range around the resonance frequency nu_res of
coherent magnetization precession in unstrained Fe81Ga19 film. It is found that
standing elastic waves give rise to complex local magnetization dynamics and
spatially inhomogeneous dynamic magnetic patterns. The spatio-temporal
distributions of the magnetization oscillations in standing elastic waves have
the form of standing spin waves with the same wavelength. Remarkably, the
amplitude of magnetization precession does not go to zero at the nodes of these
spin waves, which cannot be precisely described by simple analytical formulae.
In the steady-state regime, the magnetization oscillates with the frequency of
elastic wave, except for the case of longitudinal waves with frequencies well
below nu_res, where the magnetization precesses with a variable frequency
strongly exceeding the wave frequency. The precession amplitude at the
antinodes of standing spin waves strongly increases when the frequency of
elastic wave becomes close to nu_res. The results obtained for the
magnetization dynamics driven by elastic waves are used to calculate the spin
current pumped from the dynamically strained ferromagnet into adjacent

spin current via the inverse spin Hall effect is high enough to be measured

\emph{highly efficient RG flow} that can also determine the UV data in the
field theory in the strong coupling and large $N$ limit. We introduce a special
way to define operators at any given scale in terms of appropriate
coarse-grained collective variables, without requiring the use of the
elementary fields. The Wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting the
cut-off to a functional of these collective variables. We impose three criteria
to determine the coarse-graining. The first criterion is that the effective
Ward identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. should
preserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric and
sources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. The
second criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in the
actual background metric should be state-independent, implying that the
collective variables should not explicitly appear in them. The final criterion
is that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the RG flow can be transformed
to a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic equations with a
finite number of parameters, such as incompressible non-relativistic
Navier-Stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the scale and of the time
coordinate. Using previous work, we explicitly show that in the hydrodynamic
limit each such highly efficient RG flow reproduces a unique classical gravity
theory with precise UV data that satisfy our IR criterion. We obtain the
explicit coarse-graining which reproduces Einstein's equations. In a simple
example, we are also able to compute the beta function. Finally, we show how
our construction can be interpolated with the traditional Wilsonian RG flow at
a suitable scale, and can be used to develop new non-perturbative frameworks
for QCD-like theories.

of the Universe is achieved with positive pressure. On the other hand, the
behaviour of small cosmological perturbations reproduces the one found in the
relativistic context, even if only at small scales. We argue that this last
result may open new possibilities for numerical simulations for structure
formation in the Universe. Finally, the properties of neutron stars are
qualitatively reproduced by Hwang-Noh equations, but the upper mass limit is at

Our thanks to the reviewer and editor",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the question ""Is every nonzero generic degree a
density-1-bounding generic degree?"" By previous results \cite{I2} either
resolution of this question would answer an open question concerning the
structure of the generic degrees: A positive result would prove that there are
no minimal generic degrees, and a negative result would prove that there exist
minimal pairs in the generic degrees.
  We consider several techniques for showing that the answer might be positive,
and use those techniques to prove that a wide class of assumptions is
sufficient to prove density-1-bounding.
  We also consider a historic difficulty in constructing a potential
counterexample: By previous results \cite{I1} any generic degree that is not
density-1-bounding must be quasiminimal, so in particular, any construction of
a non-density-1-bounding generic degree must use a method that is able to
construct a quasiminimal generic degree. However, all previously known examples
of quasiminimal sets are also density-1, and so trivially density-1-bounding.
We provide several examples of non-density-1 sets that are quasiminimal.
  Using cofinite and mod-finite reducibility, we extend our results to the
uniform coarse degrees, and to the nonuniform generic degrees. We define all of
the above terms, and we provide independent motivation for the study of each of
them.
  Combined with a concurrently written paper of Hirschfeldt, Jockusch, Kuyper,
and Schupp \cite{HJKS}, this paper provides a characterization of the level of
randomness required to ensure quasiminimality in the uniform and nonuniform
coarse and generic degrees.

uncertainty can be as large as the energy itself, $\sigma_E \sim E$, and the
coherence length is short. On the way to the Earth the wave packets of mass
eigenstates spread to macroscopic sizes and separate. Inside the Earth the mass
eigenstates split into eigenstates in matter and oscillate again. The coherence
length in the Earth is comparable with the radius of the Earth. We explore
these features and their consequences. (i) We present new estimates of the wave

packets with spatial spread and show that it is not modified by the spread.
(iii) We study the coherence of neutrinos propagating in a multi-layer medium

partially restored due to a ""catch-up effect"", increasing the coherence length

neutrinos as they cross the shock wave fronts in the exploding star or the core

twofold. First, we give a systematic method, depending in a simple manner on
the Hessenberg function $h$, for producing an explicit presentation by
generators and relations of the cohomology ring $H^\ast(Hess(\mathsf{N},h))$
with $\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients of the corresponding regular nilpotent
Hessenberg variety $Hess(\mathsf{N},h)$. Our result generalizes known results
in special cases such as the Peterson variety and also allows us to answer a
question posed by Mbirika and Tymoczko. Moreover, our list of generators in
fact forms a regular sequence, allowing us to use techniques from commutative
algebra in our arguments. Our second main result gives an isomorphism between
the cohomology ring $H^*(Hess(\mathsf{N},h))$ of the regular nilpotent
Hessenberg variety and the $S_n$-invariant subring
$H^*(Hess(\mathsf{S},h))^{S_n}$ of the cohomology ring of the regular
semisimple Hessenberg variety (with respect to the $S_n$-action on
$H^*(Hess(\mathsf{S},h))$ defined by Tymoczko). Our second main result implies
that $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{Q}} H^k(Hess(\mathsf{N},h)) =
\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{Q}} H^k(Hess(\mathsf{S},h))^{S_n}$ for all $k$ and hence
partially proves the Shareshian-Wachs conjecture in combinatorics, which is in
turn related to the well-known Stanley-Stembridge conjecture. A proof of the
full Shareshian-Wachs conjecture was recently given by Brosnan and Chow, but in
our special case, our methods yield a stronger result (i.e. an isomorphism of
rings) by more elementary considerations. This paper provides detailed proofs
of results we recorded previously in a research announcement.

growth rate $f\sigma_8$ in the original DGP model is suppressed compared with
the $\Lambda$CDM case, for the same value of the current density parameter of

constant. In case of the kinetic gravity braiding model and the Galileon model,
the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ is enhanced compared with the $\Lambda$CDM case,

Decelle et al., backed by Mossel et al., made the following conjecture: Denote
by $k$ the number of balanced communities, $a/n$ the probability of connecting
inside communities and $b/n$ across, and set
$\mathrm{SNR}=(a-b)^2/(k(a+(k-1)b)$; for any $k \geq 2$, it is possible to
detect communities efficiently whenever $\mathrm{SNR}>1$ (the KS threshold),
whereas for $k\geq 4$, it is possible to detect communities
information-theoretically for some $\mathrm{SNR}<1$. Massouli\'e, Mossel et
al.\ and Bordenave et al.\ succeeded in proving that the KS threshold is
efficiently achievable for $k=2$, while Mossel et al.\ proved that it cannot be
crossed information-theoretically for $k=2$. The above conjecture remained open
for $k \geq 3$.
  This paper proves this conjecture, further extending the efficient detection
to non-symmetrical SBMs with a generalized notion of detection and KS
threshold. For the efficient part, a linearized acyclic belief propagation
(ABP) algorithm is developed and proved to detect communities for any $k$ down
to the KS threshold in time $O(n \log n)$. Achieving this requires showing
optimality of ABP in the presence of cycles, a challenge for message passing
algorithms. The paper further connects ABP to a power iteration method with a
nonbacktracking operator of generalized order, formalizing the interplay
between message passing and spectral methods. For the information-theoretic
(IT) part, a non-efficient algorithm sampling a typical clustering is shown to
break down the KS threshold at $k=4$. The emerging gap is shown to be large in
some cases; if $a=0$, the KS threshold reads $b \gtrsim k^2$ whereas the IT
bound reads $b \gtrsim k \ln(k)$, making the SBM a good study-case for
information-computation gaps.

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, stating that some pairs of observables

interferometers, showing that WPDRs correspond to a modern formulation of the
uncertainty principle stated in terms of entropies. Furthermore, our
unification provides a framework for solving an outstanding problem of how to
formulate universally valid WPDRs for interferometers with more than two paths,

invariance imposes interesting patterns on its decays into electroweak gauge
bosons, which are dictated by only two free parameters. Therefore experimental
measurements on any two of the four possible electroweak channels would
determine the remaining two decay channels completely. Furthermore, searches in
the WW/ZZ channels probe a complimentary region of parameter space from
searches in the gamma-gamma/Z-gamma channels. We derive a model-independent
upper bound on the branching fraction in each decay channel, which for the
diphoton channel turns out to be about 61%. Including the coupling to gluons,
the upper bound on the diphoton branching fraction implies an upper bound on
the mass scale of additional colored particles mediating the gluon-fusion
production. Using an event rate of about 5 fb for the reported 750 GeV diphoton

objective is to identify the region that is reachable from a given source
within a certain amount of time. While there is a wide range of practical
applications for this problem (e.g., reachability analyses, geomarketing,
visualizing the cruising range of a vehicle), there has been little research on
fast computation of isochrones on large, realistic inputs. In this work, we
formalize the notion of isochrones in road networks and present a basic
approach for the resulting problem based on Dijkstra's algorithm. Moreover, we
consider several speedup techniques that are based on previous approaches for
one-to-many shortest path computation (or similar scenarios). In contrast to
such related problems, the set of targets is not part of the input when
computing isochrones. We extend known Multilevel Dijkstra techniques (such as
CRP) to the isochrone scenario, adapting a previous technique called isoGRASP
to our problem setting (thereby, enabling faster queries). Moreover, we
introduce a family of algorithms based on (single-level) graph partitions,
following different strategies to exploit the efficient access patterns of
PHAST, a well-known approach towards one-to-all queries. Our experimental study
reveals that all speedup techniques allow fast isochrone computation on input
graphs at continental scale, while providing different tradeoffs between
preprocessing effort, space consumption, and query performance. Finally, we
demonstrate that all techniques scale well when run in parallel, decreasing
query times to a few milliseconds (orders of magnitude faster than the basic
approach) and enabling even interactive applications.

cross-$t$-intersecting if each set in $\mathcal{A}$ intersects each set in
$\mathcal{B}$ in at least $t$ elements. An active problem in extremal set
theory is to determine the maximum product of sizes of cross-$t$-intersecting
subfamilies of a given family. We prove a cross-$t$-intersection theorem for
weighted subsets of a set by means of a new subfamily alteration method, and
use the result to provide solutions for three natural families. For
$r\in[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, let ${[n]\choose r}$ be the family of $r$-element
subsets of $[n]$, and let ${[n]\choose\leq r}$ be the family of subsets of
$[n]$ that have at most $r$ elements. Let $\mathcal{F}_{n,r,t}$ be the family
of sets in ${[n]\choose\leq r}$ that contain $[t]$. We show that if
$g:{[m]\choose\leq r}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+$ and $h:{[n]\choose\leq
s}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+$ are functions that obey certain conditions,
$\mathcal{A}\subseteq{[m]\choose\leq r}$, $\mathcal{B}\subseteq{[n]\choose\leq
s}$, and $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are cross-$t$-intersecting, then
\[\sum_{A\in\mathcal{A}}g(A)\sum_{B\in\mathcal{B}}h(B)\leq\sum_{C\in\mathcal{F}_{m,r,t}}g(C)\sum_{D\in\mathcal{F}_{n,s,t}}h(D),\]
and equality holds if $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{F}_{m,r,t}$ and
$\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{F}_{n,s,t}$. We prove this in a more general setting and
characterise the cases of equality. We use the result to show that the maximum
product of sizes of two cross-$t$-intersecting families
$\mathcal{A}\subseteq{[m]\choose r}$ and $\mathcal{B}\subseteq{[n]\choose s}$
is ${m-t\choose r-t}{n-t\choose s-t}$ for $\min\{m,n\}\geq n_0(r,s,t)$, where
$n_0(r,s,t)$ is close to best possible. We obtain analogous results for
families of integer sequences and for families of multisets. The results yield
generalisations for $k\geq2$ cross-$t$-intersecting families, and
Erdos-Ko-Rado-type results.

the affine Yangians of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, denoted by
$\mathcal{U}^{(n)}_{q_1,q_2,q_3}$ and $\mathcal{Y}^{(n)}_{h_1,h_2,h_3}$,
respectively. Our motivation arises from the milestone work of Gautam and
Toledano Laredo, where a similar relation between the quantum loop algebra
$U_q(L \mathfrak{g})$ and the Yangian $Y_h(\mathfrak{g})$ has been established
by constructing an isomorphism of $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-algebras
$\Phi:\widehat{U}_{\exp(\hbar)}(L\mathfrak{g})\to
\widehat{Y}_\hbar(\mathfrak{g})$ (with $\ \widehat{}\ $ standing for the
appropriate completions). These two completions model the behavior of the
algebras in the formal neighborhood of $h=0$. The same construction can be
applied to the toroidal setting with $q_i=\exp(\hbar_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$.
  In the current paper, we are interested in the more general relation:
$\mathrm{q}_1=\omega_{mn}e^{h_1/m}, \mathrm{q}_2=e^{h_2/m},
\mathrm{q}_3=\omega_{mn}^{-1}e^{h_3/m}$, where $m,n\in \mathbb{N}$ and
$\omega_{mn}$ is an $mn$-th root of $1$. Assuming $\omega_{mn}^m$ is a
primitive $n$-th root of unity, we construct a homomorphism
$\Phi^{\omega_{mn}}_{m,n}$ from the completion of the formal version of
$\mathcal{U}^{(m)}_{\mathrm{q}_1,\mathrm{q}_2,\mathrm{q}_3}$ to the completion
of the formal version of $\mathcal{Y}^{(mn)}_{h_1/mn,h_2/mn,h_3/mn}$. We
propose two proofs of this result: (1) by constructing the compatible
isomorphism between the faithful representations of the algebras; (2) by
combining the direct verification of Gautam and Toledano Laredo for the
classical setting with the shuffle approach.

culminating in the period of early family formation during which the focus is

alloparental care, while at this stage female same-gender friendship also
peaks. During post-reproductive adulthood, individuals and especially women
balance close social contacts among three generations. The age of

fluctuation measures in heavy-ion collisions is the range of correlations in
the momentum space, e.g., in rapidity, $\Delta y_{\rm corr}$. The value of
$\Delta y_{\rm corr}\sim1$ for critical thermal fluctuations is determined by
the thermal rapidity spread of the particles at freezeout, and has little to do
with position space correlations, even near the critical point where the
spatial correlation length $\xi$ becomes as large as $2-3$ fm (this is in
contrast to the magnitudes of the cumulants, which are sensitive to $\xi$).
When the acceptance window is large, $\Delta y\gg\Delta y_{\rm corr}$, the
cumulants of a given particle multiplicity, $\kappa_k$, scale linearly with
$\Delta y$, or mean multiplicity in acceptance, $\langle N\rangle$, and
cumulant ratios are acceptance independent. While in the opposite regime,
$\Delta y\ll\Delta y_{\rm corr}$, the factorial cumulants, $\hat\kappa_k$,
scale as $(\Delta y)^k$, or $\langle N\rangle^k$. We demonstrate this general
behavior quantitatively in a model for critical point fluctuations, which also
shows that the dependence on transverse momentum acceptance is very
significant. We conclude that extension of rapidity coverage proposed by STAR
should significantly increase the magnitude of the critical point fluctuation
signatures.

fermionic dark matter. The mixing between the singlet scalar and the Higgs
boson provides a portal to dark matter. The inflaton could either be the Higgs
boson or the singlet scalar, and slow roll inflation is realized via its
non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this setup, the effective scalar potential
is stabilized by the mixing between two scalars and coupling with dark matter.
We study constraints from collider searches, relic density and direct
detection, and find that dark matter mass should be around half the mass of
either the Higgs boson or singlet scalar. Using the renormalization group

low-energy supersymmetry. Beyond the MSSM and the NMSSM, we study the
MSSM-extensions with an extra $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. The anomaly cancellation
and the spontaneous breaking of the non-decoupled $U(1)'$ generically require
introducing vector-like supermultiplets (both colored and color-neutral ones)
and singlet supermultiplets, respectively. We illustrate that the potential 750
GeV resonance ($Y$) can be accommodated in various mechanisms, as a
singlet-like scalar or pseudoscalar. Three benchmark scenarios are presented:
(1) vector-like quarks (VLQ) mediated $pp \to Y \to \gamma \gamma$; (2) scalar
VLQ mediated $pp \to Y \to \gamma \gamma$; (3) heavy scalar (pseudo-scalar)
$H/A$ associated production $pp \to H^*/A^* \to Y H/h$. Additionally, we notice
that the $Z'$-mediated vector boson fusion production and $Z'$-associated

might have been excluded by the searches for $Z'$ via Drell-Yan process at the

diphoton channel at the LHC experiments are a powerful tool to probe a new
physics. One of the most natural explanations of a diphoton excess, if it
occurs, could be a new scalar boson with exotic colored particles. In this
setup, it would be legitimate to ask what is the role of this new scalar in

the discovery at the collider experiments with numerous motivations. While the
Landau-Yang theorem dictates the diphoton excess cannot be this spin-1 gauge

scalar boson which provides a mass to the gauge boson being at the same mass

property similar to the recently highlighted 750 GeV would suggest an existence
of a TeV scale $Z'$ gauge boson that might be within the reach of the LHC Run 2

eigenvalues determine the spatial behavior of Polyakov loop correlations

dimensions, and valid in the strong-coupling region for any number of
dimensions. When the quark chemical potential $\mu$ is nonzero, the spatial
transfer matrix $T_s$ is non-Hermitian. The appearance of complex eigenvalues
in $T_s$ is a manifestation of the sign problem in finite-density QCD. The
invariance of finite-density QCD under the combined action of charge
conjugation $\mathcal{C}$ and complex conjugation $\mathcal{K}$ implies that
the eigenvalues of $T_s$ are either real or part of a complex pair. Calculation
of the spectrum confirms the existence of complex pairs in much of the

quarks are determined by a particle-hole symmetry. For $\mu$ small compared to
the quark mass $M$, we typically find real eigenvalues for the lowest lying
states. At somewhat larger values of $\mu,$ pairs of eigenvalues may form
complex-conjugate pairs, leading to damped oscillatory behavior in Polyakov
loop correlation functions. However, near $\mu=M$, the low-lying spectrum
becomes real again. This is a direct consequence of the approximate
particle-hole symmetry at $\mu=M$ for heavy quarks. This behavior of the
eigenvalues should be observable in lattice simulations and can be used as a
test of lattice algorithms. Our results provide independent confirmation of

LRTCs constitute supporting evidence that the brain operates near criticality,
a state where neuronal activities are balanced between order and randomness.
Here, healthy adults used closed-loop brain training (neurofeedback, NFB) to
reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, producing a significant increase in
spontaneous LRTCs post-training. This effect was reproduced in patients with
post-traumatic stress disorder, where abnormally random dynamics were reversed
by NFB, correlating with significant improvements in hyperarousal. Notably,
regions manifesting abnormally low LRTCs (i.e., excessive randomness)
normalized toward healthy population levels, consistent with theoretical
predictions about self-organized criticality. Hence, when exposed to
appropriate training, spontaneous cortical activity reveals a residual capacity
for ""self-tuning"" its own temporal complexity, despite manifesting the abnormal
dynamics seen in individuals with psychiatric disorder. Lastly, we observed an
inverse-U relationship between strength of LRTC and oscillation amplitude,
suggesting a breakdown of long-range dependence at high/low synchronization

not require a spacetime splitting and treats the space-time variables on an
equal footing. Quantum dynamics is described by a precanonical wave function on
the finite dimensional space of field coordinates and space-time coordinates,
which satisfies a partial derivative precanonical Schr\""odinger equation. The
standard QFT in the functional Schr\""odinger representation can be derived from
the precanonical quantization in a limiting case. An analysis of the
constraints within the DW Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein-Palatini
vielbein formulation of GR and quantization of the generalized Dirac brackets
defined on differential forms lead to the covariant precanonical Schr\""odinger
equation for quantum gravity. The resulting dynamics of quantum gravity is
described by the wave function or transition amplitudes on the total space of
the bundle of spin connections over space-time. Thus, precanonical quantization
leads to the ""spin connection foam"" picture of quantum geometry represented by
a generally non-Gaussian random field of spin connection coefficients, whose
probability distribution is given by the precanonical wave function. The

A prerequisite is that the pairing potential of the underlying superconductor
breaks the spin-rotation symmetry, as it is generically the case in systems
with strong spin-orbit coupling. We illustrate this mechanism for a spinless
triplet-superconductor p+ip and a time-reversal symmetric Rashba superconductor
with a mixture of singlet and triplet pairing. For the latter, we show that the

framework of the nuclear density functional theory (DFT), has been a standard
tool to access the collective excitations of the atomic nuclei. Recently,
finite amplitude method (FAM) has been developed, in order to perform the QRPA
calculations efficiently without any truncation on the two-quasiparticle model
space. Purpose: We discuss the nuclear giant dipole resonance (GDR) in heavy
rare-earth isotopes, for which the conventional matrix diagonalization of the
QRPA is numerically demanding. A role of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule
enhancement factor, connected to the isovector effective mass, is also
investigated. Methods: The electric dipole photoabsorption cross section was
calculated within a parallelized FAM-QRPA scheme. We employed the Skyrme energy
density functional self-consistently in the DFT calculation for the ground
states and FAM-QRPA calculation for the excitations. Results: The mean GDR
frequency and width are mostly reproduced with the FAM-QRPA, when compared to
experimental data, although some deficiency is observed with isotopes heavier
than erbium. A role of the TRK enhancement factor in actual GDR strength is
clearly shown: its increment leads to a shift of the GDR strength to
higher-energy region, without a significant change in the transition
amplitudes. Conclusions: The newly developed FAM-QRPA scheme shows a remarkable
efficiency, which enables to perform systematic analysis of GDR for heavy
rare-earth nuclei. Theoretical deficiency of photoabsorption cross section
could not be improved by only adjusting the TRK enhancement factor, suggesting
the necessity of beyond the self-consistent QRPA approach, and/or a more
systematic optimization of the EDF parameters.

blueshifted absorption lines from disk winds which seem to be equatorial. Winds
occur in the Softer (disk-dominated) states of the outburst and are less
prominent or absent in the Harder (power-law dominated) states. We use
self-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-ejection models to explain
the disk winds in BHBs. In our models, the density at the base of the outflow
from the accretion disk is not a free parameter, but is determined by solving
the full set of dynamical MHD equations. Thus the physical properties of the
outflow are controlled by the global structure of the disk. We studied
different MHD solutions characterized by different values of (a) the disk
aspect ratio ($\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We use two
kinds of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence
(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. Such heating could be from e.g.
dissipation of energy due to MHD turbulence in the disk or from illumination.
We use each of these MHD solutions to predict the physical parameters of an
outflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\xi$), column density and
timescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions within
the outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. The cold MHD
solutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. But
warm solutions can explain the observed physical quantities in the wind because
they can have sufficiently high values of $p$ ($\gtrsim 0.1$, implying larger
mass loading at the base of the outflow). Further from our thermodynamic
equilibrium curve analysis for the outflowing gas, we found that in the Hard
state a range of $\xi$ is thermodynamically unstable, and had to be excluded.
This constrain made it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state.

approximation. Presently most calculations use the collision-free Lindhard
dielectric function to evaluate the free-electron contribution to the Thomson
cross section. In this work, we use the Mermin dielectric function, which
includes relaxation time explicitly. The relaxation time is evaluated by
treating the average atom as an impurity in a uniform electron gas and depends
critically on the transport cross section. The calculated relaxation rates
agree well with values inferred from the Ziman formula for the static
conductivity and also with rates inferred from a fit to the frequency-dependent
conductivity. Transport cross sections determined by the phase-shift analysis
in the average-atom potential are compared with those evaluated in the commonly
used Born approximation. The Born approximation converges to the exact cross
sections at high energies; however, differences that occur at low energies lead
to corresponding differences in relaxation rates. The relative importance of
including relaxation time when modeling X-ray Thomson scattering spectra is
examined by comparing calculations of the free-electron dynamic structure
function for Thomson scattering using Lindhard and Mermin dielectric functions.
Applications are given to warm-dense Be plasmas, with temperatures ranging from

ideas were used to solve least squares regression problems. In this paper, we
show how matrices from error correcting codes can be used to find such low rank
approximations and matrix decompositions, and extend the framework to linear
least squares regression problems. The benefits of using these code matrices
are the following: (i) They are easy to generate and they reduce randomness
significantly. (ii) Code matrices with mild properties satisfy the subspace
embedding property, and have a better chance of preserving the geometry of an
entire subspace of vectors. (iii) For parallel and distributed applications,
code matrices have significant advantages over structured random matrices and
Gaussian random matrices. (iv) Unlike Fourier or Hadamard transform matrices,
which require sampling $O(k\log k)$ columns for a rank-$k$ approximation, the
log factor is not necessary for certain types of code matrices. That is,
$(1+\epsilon)$ optimal Frobenius norm error can be achieved for a rank-$k$
approximation with $O(k/\epsilon)$ samples. (v) Fast multiplication is possible
with structured code matrices, so fast approximations can be achieved for
general dense input matrices. (vi) For least squares regression problem
$\min\|Ax-b\|_2$ where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, the $(1+\epsilon)$
relative error approximation can be achieved with $O(d/\epsilon)$ samples, with

\mathbb N$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, $S_j(x)=\frac 1{3^{j}}x+1-\frac 1 {3^{j-1}}$.
Then, the support of $P$ is the dyadic Cantor set $C$ generated by the
similarity mappings $f_1, f_2 : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ such that
$f_1(x)=\frac 13 x$ and $f_2(x)=\frac 13 x+\frac 23$ for all $x\in \mathbb R$.
In this paper, using the infinite system of similarity mappings $\{S_j : j\in
\mathbb N\}$ associated with the probability vector $(\frac 12, \frac 1{2^2},
\cdots)$, for all $n\in \mathbb N$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means
and the $n$th quantization errors for the infinite self-similar measure $P$.
The technique obtained in this paper can be utilized to determine the optimal
sets of $n$-means and the $n$th quantization errors for more general infinite
self-similar measures.

Ambrus, Ball and Erd\'elyi, and proved recently by Hardin, Kendall and Saff.
These results were formulated on the torus, hence we also work on the torus,
but one of the main motivations for our extension comes from an analogous setup
on the unit interval, investigated earlier by Fenton.
  Basically, the problem is a minimax one, i.e. to minimize the maximum of a
function $F$, defined as the sum of arbitrary translates of certain fixed
""kernel functions"", minimization understood with respect to the translates. If
these kernels are assumed to be concave, having certain singularities or cusps
at zero, then translates by $y_j$ will have singularities at $y_j$ (while in
between these nodes the sum function still behaves realtively regularly). So
one can consider the maxima $m_i$ on each subintervals between the nodes $y_j$,
and look for the minimization of $\max F = \max_i m_i$.
  Here also a dual question of maximization of $\min_i m_i$ arises. This type
of minimax problems were treated under some additional assumptions on the
kernels. Also the problem is normalized so that $y_0=0$.
  In particular, Hardin, Kendall and Saff assumed that we have one single
kernel $K$ on the torus or circle, and $F=\sum_{j=0}^n K(\cdot-y_j)= K +
\sum_{j=1}^n K(\cdot-y_j)$. Fenton considered situations on the interval with
two fixed kernels $J$ and $K$, also satisfying additional assumptions, and $F=
J + \sum_{j=1}^n K(\cdot-y_j)$. Here we consider the situation (on the circle)
when \emph{all the kernel functions can be different}, and $F=\sum_{j=0}^n
K_j(\cdot- y_j) = K_0 + \sum_{j=1}^n K_j(\cdot-y_j)$. Also an emphasis is put
on relaxing all other technical assumptions and give alternative, rather
minimal variants of the set of conditions on the kernel.

framework for the SIR epidemic model to examine the effect of (i) source of

disease risk. We measured risk as outbreak probability and outbreak size in a
focal host, represented by one network layer. Numeric simulations were used to
validate the analytic formulations. We found that outbreak probability is
determined by a complex interaction between source of infection and
between-host infection probabilities, whereas outbreak size is mainly affected
by the non-focal host to focal host infection probability alone. Hence,
inter-specific asymmetry in infection probabilities shapes disease dynamics in
multihost networks. These results expand current theory of monolayer networks,
where outbreak size and probability are considered equal, highlighting the
importance of considering multiple measures of disease risk. Our study advances

fluctuation part of the refractive index (dn) is much smaller than the mismatch
as well as the mean refractive index of the sample (dn << <n>). In the
theoretical derivation, we perform a detailed calculation that results in the
analytical forms of mean and standard deviation (STD) of the reflectance in
terms of disorder parameters (dn and lc) in an index mismatched backscattering
system. Particularly, the orders of disorder parameters in STD of the
reflectance for index mismatched systems is shown to be lower ( (<dn^2> lc
)^1/2 ) than that of the matched systems (<dn^2> lc). By comparing STDs of the
reflection coefficient of index matched and mismatched systems, we show that
reflectance at the sample boundaries in index mismatched systems can enhance
the signal of the STD to the disorder parameters of the reflectance. In terms
of biophotonics applications, this result can lead to potential techniques that
effectively extract the sample disorder parameters by manipulating the index

inertial-amplification mechanism is investigated. The mechanism has properties
similar to an ""inerter"" typically used in vehicle suspensions, however here it
is constructed and utilized in a manner that alters the intrinsic properties of
a continuous structure. The elastodynamic band structure of the hybrid
rod-mechanism structure yields band gaps that are exceedingly wide and deep
when compared to what can be obtained using standard local resonators, while
still being low in frequency. With this concept, a large band gap may be
realized with as much as twenty times less added mass compared to what is
needed in a standard local resonator configuration. The emerging inertially
enhanced continuous structure also exhibits unique qualitative features in its
dispersion curves. These include the existence of a characteristic double-peak
in the attenuation constant profile within gaps and the possibility of
coalescence of two neighbouring gaps creating a large contiguous gap.

to rethink the core compositions of neutron stars, ruling out many models for
the nuclear equations of state (EoS). We explore the hybrid stars that occur
when hadronic matter is treated in a relativistic mean-field approximation and
quark matter is modeled by three-flavor local and non-local Nambu Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) models with repulsive vector interactions. The NJL models typically yield
equations of state that feature a first order transition to quark matter.
Assuming that the quark-hadron surface tension is high enough to disfavour
mixed phases, and restricting to EoSes that allow stars to reach 2 solar
masses, we find that the appearance of the quark matter core either
destabilizes the star immediately (this is typical for non-local NJL models) or
leads to a very short hybrid star branch in the mass-radius relation (this is
typical for local NJL models). Using the Constant-Sound-Speed parametrization
we can see that the reason for the near-absence of hybrid stars is that the
transition pressure is fairly high and the transition is strongly first order.

as 3-valued logical structures, and produces finite abstract systems. Despite
providing a finite bound, these abstractions may still suffer from the state
explosion problem. Notably, for concurrent programs with arbitrary
interleaving, if threads in a state are abstracted based on their location,
then the number of locations will be a combinatorial factor in the size of the
statespace. We present an approach using canonical abstraction that avoids this
state explosion by ""collapsing"" all of the threads in a state into a single
abstract representative. Properties of threads that would be lost by the
abstraction, but are needed for verification, are retained by defining
conditional ""soft invariant"" instrumentation predicates. This technique is used
to adapt previous models for verifying linearizability of nonblocking
concurrent data structure algorithms, resulting in exponentially smaller

of high $T_c$ superconductors is a quasi two dimensional electronic environment
in which the d-orbitals of cations that participate in strong in-plane

their contributions to superconductivity. Creating the gene requires special

We extract the surface brightness profile (SBP) in the optical F 435W and NIR F
160W bands. The SBPs of BCDs in the H band reach 26 mag arcsec^-2 at the
3\sigma level, which is so far the deepest NIR imaging of BCDs. Then we fit the
SBPs with one- and two- component Sersic models. About half of the BCDs favour
the two-component model which significantly improves the fit quality. The
effective radii of the underlying hosts of BCDs in the B band are smaller than
those of early-type dwarfs (dEs) and dwarf irregulars at a fixed luminosity.
This discrepancy is similar to findings in many previous works. However, the
difference in structural parameters between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies seems
to be less significant in the H band. Furthermore, we find a remarkable
agreement between the underlying hosts of BCDs and dEs. All dwarf galaxies seem
to follow a similar luminosity-radius relationship which suggests a unified
structural evolution for dwarf galaxies. We conclude that a possible evolution
track from BCDs to dEs cannot be ruled out, with no significant change of
structure needed in the evolutionary scenario.

structure of high-dimensional data, and it is common to assume that observed
data follow a homogeneous graphical model. However, observations usually come
from different resources and have heterogeneous hidden commonality in
real-world applications. Thus, it is of great importance to estimate
heterogeneous dependencies and discover subpopulation with certain commonality
across the whole population. In this work, we introduce a novel regularized
estimation scheme for learning nonparametric mixture of Gaussian graphical
models, which extends the methodology and applicability of Gaussian graphical
models and mixture models. We propose a unified penalized likelihood approach
to effectively estimate nonparametric functional parameters and heterogeneous
graphical parameters. We further design an efficient generalized effective EM
algorithm to address three significant challenges: high-dimensionality,
non-convexity, and label switching. Theoretically, we study both the
algorithmic convergence of our proposed algorithm and the asymptotic properties
of our proposed estimators. Numerically, we demonstrate the performance of our
method in simulation studies and a real application to estimate human brain
functional connectivity from ADHD imaging data, where two heterogeneous
conditional dependencies are explained through profiling demographic variables
and supported by existing scientific findings.

form. This is a syntactical restriction of the Chomsky normal form, in which
the two nonterminals occurring on the right-hand side of a rule are paired
nonterminals. This pairwise property allows to define a homomorphism from Dyck
words to words generated by a grammar in Dyck normal form. We prove that for
each context-free language L, there exist an integer K and a homomorphism h
such that L=h(D'_K), where D'_K is a subset of the one-sided Dyck language over
K letters. Through a transition-like diagram for a context-free grammar in Dyck
normal form, we effectively build a regular language R that satisfies the
Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem. Using graphical approaches we refine R such
that the Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem still holds. Based on this readjustment
we sketch a transition diagram for a regular grammar that generates a regular
superset approximation for the initial context-free language.

filling factor and the mass of the warm ionized gas are
$\sim$10$^{-4}$--10$^{-5}$ and $\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ $M_\odot$, respectively.
The nebula has a complicated structure, which includes numerous filaments,
loops, bubbles, and knots. We found that there is a tight spatial correlation
between the H$\alpha$ nebula and the extended soft X-ray-emitting gas, both in
large and small scales. The overall morphology of the nebula is dominated by
filamentary structures radially extending from the center of the galaxy. A
large-scale bi-polar bubble extends along the minor axis of the main stellar
disk. The morphology strongly suggests that the nebula was formed by intense
outflows - superwinds - driven by starbursts. We also found three bright knots
embedded in a looped filament of ionized gas that show head-tail morphologies
in both emission-line and continuum, suggesting close interactions between the
outflows and star forming regions. Based on the morphology and surface
brightness distribution of the H$\alpha$ nebula, we propose the scenario that
three major episodes of starburst/superwind activities which were initiated
$\sim$10$^2$ Myr ago formed the extended ionized gas nebula of NGC 6240.

address a basic question in the application of a distributed algorithm: what is
the minimal computational cost in obtaining statistical optimality? In
smoothing spline setup, we observe a phase transition phenomenon for the number
of deployed machines that ends up being a simple proxy for computing cost.
Specifically, a sharp upper bound for the number of machines is established:
when the number is below this bound, statistical optimality (in terms of
nonparametric estimation or testing) is achievable; otherwise, statistical
optimality becomes impossible. These sharp bounds partly capture intrinsic
computational limits of the distributed algorithm considered in this paper, and
turn out to be fully determined by the smoothness of the regression function.
As a side remark, we argue that sample splitting may be viewed as an
alternative form of regularization, playing a similar role as smoothing
parameter.

""Uber die Erzeugung der Invarianten durch Integration."" [Gott. Nachrichten

measure for the matrix groups $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$. He also specified a calculus
from which the explicit form of these measures could be computed in terms of an
appropriate parametrisation - Hurwitz chose to use Euler angles. This enabled
him to define and compute invariant group integrals over $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$.
His main result can be interpreted probabilistically: the Euler angles of a
uniformly distributed matrix are independent with beta distributions (and
conversely). We use this interpretation to give some new probability results.
How Hurwitz's ideas and methods show themselves in the subsequent work of Weyl,
Dyson and others on foundational studies in random matrix theory is detailed.

transduction involves a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) through which
extracellular cAMP signals are transduced into Ras activation via an
intermediate heterotrimeric G-protein (G2). Ras activation is the first
polarized response to cAMP gradients in Dicty. Recent work has revealed mutiple
new characteristics of Ras activation in Dicty, thereby providing new insights
into direction sensing mechanisms and pointing to the need for new models of
chemotaxis. Here we propose a novel reaction-diffusion model of Ras activation
based on three major components: one involving the GPCR, one centered on G2,
and one involving the monomeric G protein Ras. In contrast to existing local
excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) models of direction sensing, in which a
fast-responding but slowly-diffusing activator and a slow-acting rapidly
diffusing inhibitor set up an internal gradient of activity, our model is based
on equal diffusion coefficients for all cytosolic species, and the unbalanced
local sequestration of some species leads to gradient sensing and
amplification. We show that Ric8-modulated G2 cycling between the cytosol and
membrane can account for many of the observed responses in Dicty. including
imperfect adaptation, multiple phases of Ras activity in a cAMP gradient,
rectified directional sensing, and cellular memory.

first is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of
road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car
has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its

routing games in which each of several players has an integer number of

establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibria, either in terms of
the network topology or in terms of the costs. A survey on these issues is
given in [1]. The question of uniqueness of equilibria has been studied in two
different frameworks. The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing
introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each
player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on
the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary
topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a
unique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable
atomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a
population of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the
context of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in

effectively frictionless dynamics of interfacial waves between two high
contrast, miscible, low Reynolds' number Stokes fluids. This scenario is
realized by injecting from below a lighter, viscous fluid into a column filled
with high viscosity fluid. The injected fluid forms a deformable pipe whose
diameter is proportional to the injection rate, enabling precise control over
the generation of symmetric interfacial waves. Buoyancy drives nonlinear
interfacial self-steepening while normal stresses give rise to dispersion of
interfacial waves. Extremely slow mass diffusion and mass conservation imply
that the interfacial waves are effectively dissipationless. This enables high
fidelity observations of large amplitude dispersive shock waves in this
spatially extended system, found to agree quantitatively with a nonlinear wave
averaging theory. Furthermore, several highly coherent phenomena are
investigated including dispersive shock wave backflow, the refraction or
absorption of solitons by dispersive shock waves, and the multi-phase merging
of two dispersive shock waves. The complex, coherent, nonlinear mixing of
dispersive shock waves and solitons observed here are universal features of

focuses on the predictive performance in cases of extreme events. However, the
restriction of conventional forecast evaluation methods to subsets of extreme
observations has unexpected and undesired effects, and is bound to discredit
skillful forecasts when the signal-to-noise ratio in the data generating
process is low. Conditioning on outcomes is incompatible with the theoretical
assumptions of established forecast evaluation methods, thereby confronting
forecasters with what we refer to as the forecaster's dilemma. For
probabilistic forecasts, proper weighted scoring rules have been proposed as
decision theoretically justifiable alternatives for forecast evaluation with an
emphasis on extreme events. Using theoretical arguments, simulation
experiments, and a real data study on probabilistic forecasts of U.S. inflation
and gross domestic product growth, we illustrate and discuss the forecaster's
dilemma along with potential remedies.

important role in many scientific and industrial applications. Function
evaluations in many industrial applications are severely limited and no
analytical information about objective function and constraint functions is
available. For such expensive black-box optimization tasks, the constraint
optimization algorithm COBRA was proposed, making use of RBF surrogate modeling
for both the objective and the constraint functions. COBRA has shown remarkable
success in solving reliably complex benchmark problems in less than 500
function evaluations. Unfortunately, COBRA requires careful adjustment of
parameters in order to do so.
  In this work we present a new self-adjusting algorithm SACOBRA, which is
based on COBRA and capable to achieve high-quality results with very few
function evaluations and no parameter tuning. It is shown with the help of
performance profiles on a set of benchmark problems (G-problems, MOPTA08) that
SACOBRA consistently outperforms any COBRA algorithm with fixed parameter
setting. We analyze the importance of the several new elements in SACOBRA and
find that each element of SACOBRA plays a role to boost up the overall
optimization performance. We discuss the reasons behind and get in this way a
better understanding of high-quality RBF surrogate modeling.

Here, we report a simple strategy of a detector-blinding attack based on a
recent experiment. To remove all the detector side channels, we present a
solution of measurement-device-independent QCT (MDI-QCT). This method is
similar to the idea of MDI quantum key distribution (QKD). MDI-QCT is loss
tolerant with single-photon sources and has the same bias as the original
loss-tolerant QCT under a coherent attack. Moreover, it provides the potential
advantage of doubling the secure distance for some special cases. Finally,
MDI-QCT can also be modified to fit the weak coherent-state sources. Thus,
based on the rapid development of practical MDI-QKD, our proposal can be
implemented easily.

models have motivated the design of new methods to automatically learn local
image descriptors. The latest deep ConvNets proposed for this task consist of a
siamese network that is trained by penalising misclassification of pairs of
local image patches. Current results from machine learning show that replacing
this siamese by a triplet network can improve the classification accuracy in
several problems, but this has yet to be demonstrated for local image
descriptor learning. Moreover, current siamese and triplet networks have been
trained with stochastic gradient descent that computes the gradient from
individual pairs or triplets of local image patches, which can make them prone
to overfitting. In this paper, we first propose the use of triplet networks for
the problem of local image descriptor learning. Furthermore, we also propose
the use of a global loss that minimises the overall classification error in the
training set, which can improve the generalisation capability of the model.
Using the UBC benchmark dataset for comparing local image descriptors, we show
that the triplet network produces a more accurate embedding than the siamese
network in terms of the UBC dataset errors. Moreover, we also demonstrate that
a combination of the triplet and global losses produces the best embedding in
the field, using this triplet network. Finally, we also show that the use of
the central-surround siamese network trained with the global loss produces the
best result of the field on the UBC dataset. Pre-trained models are available

Index (FIRI) which is symmetrical, proportional and scale invariant. We
demonstrate that the balance sheet can be shown to evolve with a fractal
pattern. As such we construct a fractal index that can measure the risk of
assets. This index can differentiate between the similarity and dissimilarity
in asset risk, and it will also possess the properties of being self-similar
and invariant to firm characteristics that make up its asset composition hence
invariant to all types of risk derived from assets. Self-similarity and scale
invariance across the cross section allows direct comparison of degrees of risk
in assets. This is by comparing the risk dissimilarity of assets. Being
naturally bounded to its highest upper bound, (0,2], the fractal index is able
to serve like a risk thermometer. We assign geometric probabilities of
insolvency P (equity is equal or less than 0 conditional on debt being greater
than 0).

massive structures of galaxies with masses greater than a few x 10^13 Msun at

two dimensional spatial distribution of magnitude-limited samples of galaxies
using a combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We analyze the
Millennium simulation data in a similar way to the analysis of the
observational data in order to test the LCDM cosmology. We find that there are
too many massive structures (M > 7 x 10^13 Msun) observed at z > 2 in
comparison with the simulation predictions by a factor of a few, giving a
probability of < 1/2500 of the observed data being consistent with the
simulation. Our result suggests that massive structures have emerged early, but
the reason for the discrepancy with the simulation is unclear. It could be due
to the limitation of the simulation such as the lack of key, unrecognized
ingredients (strong non-Gaussianity or other baryonic physics), or simply a
difficulty in the halo mass estimation from observation, or a fundamental
problem of the LCDM cosmology. On the other hand, the over-abundance of massive
structures at high redshifts does not favor heavy neutrino mass of ~ 0.3 eV or
larger, as heavy neutrinos make the discrepancy between the observation and the
simulation more pronounced by a factor of 3 or more.

spectral indices are shown to have a mean, velocity-averaged, broad-line
H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio of $\thickapprox 2.72 \pm 0.04$, consistent with a
Baker-Menzel Case B value. Comparison of a wide range of properties of the very
bluest AGNs with those of a luminosity-matched subset of the Dong et al. blue
AGN sample indicates that the only difference is the internal reddening.
Ultraviolet fluxes are brighter for the bluest AGNs by an amount consistent
with the flat AGN reddening curve of Gaskell et al.(2004). The lack of a
significant difference in the GALEX (FUV--NUV) colour index strongly rules out
a steep SMC-like reddening curve and also argues against an intrinsically
harder spectrum for the bluest AGNs. For very blue AGNs the Ly$\alpha$/H$\beta$
ratio is also consistent with being the Case B value. The Case B ratios provide
strong support for the self-shielded broad-line model of Gaskell, Klimek &
Nazarova. It is proposed that the greatly enhanced Ly$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio at
very high velocities is a consequence of continuum fluorescence in the Lyman
lines (Case C). Reddenings of AGNs mean that the far-UV luminosity is often
underestimated by up to an order of magnitude. This is a major factor causing
the discrepancies between measured accretion disc sizes and the predictions of
simple accretion disc theory. Dust covering fractions for most AGNs are lower

analyse how the algorithms and network structure affect throughput, the
fairness of flow allocation, and the location of bottleneck edges. The more
realistic proportional fairness and max-min fairness algorithms have similar
throughput, but path flow allocations are more unequal in scale-free than in
random regular networks. Scale-free networks have lower throughput than their
random regular counterparts in the uniform-flow algorithm, which is favoured in
the complex networks literature. We show, however, that this relation is
reversed on all other congestion control algorithms for a region of the
parameter space given by the degree exponent $\gamma$ and average degree ${k}$.
Moreover, the uniform-flow algorithm severely underestimates the network
throughput of congested networks, and a rich phenomenology of path flow
allocations is only present in the more realistic $\alpha$-fair family of
algorithms. Finally, we show that the number of paths passing through an edge
characterises the location of a wide range of bottleneck edges in these
algorithms. Such identification of bottlenecks could provide a bridge between
the two fields of complex networks and congestion control.

to learn complex models with millions to billions of parameters, that promise
adequate capacity to digest massive datasets and offer powerful predictive
analytics thereupon. In order to run ML algorithms at such scales, on a
distributed cluster with 10s to 1000s of machines, it is often the case that
significant engineering efforts are required --- and one might fairly ask if
such engineering truly falls within the domain of ML research or not. Taking
the view that Big ML systems can benefit greatly from ML-rooted statistical and
algorithmic insights --- and that ML researchers should therefore not shy away
from such systems design --- we discuss a series of principles and strategies
distilled from our recent efforts on industrial-scale ML solutions. These
principles and strategies span a continuum from application, to engineering,
and to theoretical research and development of Big ML systems and
architectures, with the goal of understanding how to make them efficient,
generally-applicable, and supported with convergence and scaling guarantees.
They concern four key questions which traditionally receive little attention in
ML research: How to distribute an ML program over a cluster? How to bridge ML
computation with inter-machine communication? How to perform such
communication? What should be communicated between machines? By exposing
underlying statistical and algorithmic characteristics unique to ML programs
but not typically seen in traditional computer programs, and by dissecting
successful cases to reveal how we have harnessed these principles to design and
develop both high-performance distributed ML software as well as
general-purpose ML frameworks, we present opportunities for ML researchers and
practitioners to further shape and grow the area that lies between ML and
systems.

1950s, exploring novel pairing mechanisms for fermion superfluids has become
one of the central tasks in modern physics. Here, we investigate a new type of
fermion superfluid with hybridized $s$- and $p$-wave pairings in an ultracold
spin-1/2 Fermi gas. Its occurrence is facilitated by the co-existence of
comparable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions, which is realizable in a
two-component $^{40}$K Fermi gas with close-by $s$- and $p$-wave Feshbach
resonances. The hybridized superfluid state is stable over a considerable
parameter region on the phase diagram, and can lead to intriguing patterns of
spin densities and pairing fields in momentum space. In particular, it can
induce a phase-locked $p$-wave pairing in the fermion species that has no
$p$-wave interactions. The hybridized nature of this novel superfluid can also
be confirmed by measuring the $s$-wave and $p$-wave contacts, which can be
extracted from the high-momentum tail of the momentum distribution of each spin
component. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi
systems, and open the avenue for achieving novel fermion superfluids with
multiple partial-wave scatterings in cold atomic gases.

  Formation of Inert Octahedral Complexes","41 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We used density functional theory to computationally design a Zr
organometallic catalyst for selectively oxidizing substrates using molecular
oxygen as oxidant without coreductant. Each selective oxidation cycle involves
four general steps: (a) a peroxo or weakly adsorbed O2 group releases an O atom
to substrate to form substrate oxide and an oxo group, (b) an oxygen molecule
adds to the oxo group to generate an eta2-ozone group, (c) the eta2-ozone group
rearranges to form an eta3-ozone group, and (d) the eta3-ozone group releases
an O atom to substrate to form substrate oxide and regenerate the peroxo or
weakly adsorbed O2 group. This catalyst could potentially be synthesized via
the condensation reaction Zr(N(R)R')4 + 2
C6H4-1,6-(N(C6H3-2',6'-(CH(CH3)2)2)OH)2 -->
Zr(C6H4-1,6-(N(C6H3-2',6'-(CH(CH3)2)2)O)2)2 [aka Zr_Benzol catalyst] + 4
N(R)(R')H where R and R' are CH3, CH2CH3, or other alkyl groups. For direct
ethylene epoxidation, the computed enthalpic energetic span (i.e., effective
activation energy for the entire catalytic cycle) is 27.1 kcal/mol, which is
one of the lowest values for catalysts studied to date. We study reaction
mechanisms and the stability of different catalyst forms as a function of the
oxygen atom chemical potential. Notably, an aromatic linkage in each ligand
prevents this catalyst from deactivating to form an inactive octahedral-like
structure that contains the same atoms as the dioxo complex, Zr(Ligand)2(O)2.
Due to a side reaction that can transfer an allylic H atom from alkene to
catalyst, this catalyst is useful for directly epoxidizing alkenes such as
ethylene that do not contain allylic H atoms. To better understand the reaction
chemistry, we computed net atomic charges and bond orders for the two
catalytically relevant reaction cycles. These results quantify electron
transfer and bond forming and breaking during the catalytic process.

geographic area, BusPlus proposes a hub and shuttle model consisting of a
combination of a few high-frequency bus routes between key hubs and a large
number of shuttles that bring passengers from their origin to the closest hub
and take them from their last bus stop to their destination. This paper focuses
on the design of bus network and proposes an efficient solving method to this
multimodal network design problem based on the Benders decomposition method.
Starting from a MIP formulation of the problem, the paper presents a Benders
decomposition approach using dedicated solution techniques for solving
independent sub-problems, Pareto optimal cuts, cut bundling, and core point
update. Computational results on real-world data from Canberra's public transit
system justify the design choices and show that the approach outperforms the
MIP formulation by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the results show that the
hub and shuttle model may decrease transit time by a factor of 2, while staying
within the costs of the existing transit system.

metastatic melanoma have been analysed using fractal and multifractal analysis
to assess the impact of monoclonal antibody ipilimumab treatment with respect
to therapy outcome. Our analysis shows that the fractal dimensions which
describe the tracer dispersion in the body decrease consistently with the
deterioration of the patient therapeutic outcome condition. In 20 out-of 24
cases the fractal analysis results match those of the medical records, while 7
cases are considered as special cases because the patients have non-tumour
related medical conditions or side effects which affect the results. The
decrease in the fractal dimensions with the deterioration of the patient
conditions (in terms of disease progression) are attributed to the hierarchical
localisation of the tracer which accumulates in the affected lesions and does
not spread homogeneously throughout the body. Fractality emerges as a result of
the migration patterns which the malignant cells follow for propagating within
the body (circulatory system, lymphatic system). Analysis of the multifractal
spectrum complements and supports the results of the fractal analysis. In the
kinetic Monte Carlo modelling of the metastatic process a small number of
malignant cells diffuse throughout a fractal medium representing the blood
circulatory network. Along their way the malignant cells engender random
metastases (colonies) with a small probability and, as a result, fractal
spatial distributions of the metastases are formed similar to the ones observed
in the PET/CT images. In conclusion, we propose that fractal and multifractal
analysis has potential application in the quantification of the evaluation of
PET/CT images to monitor the disease evolution as well as the response to
different medical treatments.
