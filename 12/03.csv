dynamics simulations, we explore the flow of two-dimensional colloidal solids
and fluids driven through a linear channel with a geometric constriction. The
flow is generated by a constant external force acting on all colloids. The
initial configuration is equilibrated in the absence of flow and then the
external force is switched on instantaneously. Upon starting the flow, we
observe four different scenarios: a complete blockade, a monotonic decay to a
constant particle flux (typical for a fluid), a damped oscillatory behaviour in
the particle flux, and a long-lived stop-and-go behaviour in the flow (typical
for a solid). The dynamical density functional theory describes all four
situations but predicts infinitely long undamped oscillations in the flow which
are always damped in the simulations. We attribute the mechanisms of the
underlying stop-and-go flow to symmetry conditions on the flowing solid. Our
predictions are verifiable in real-space experiments on magnetic colloidal
monolayers which are driven through structured microchannels and can be
exploited to steer the flow throughput in microfluidics.

fully characterize the Abelian phase of a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$

is a class of stabilizer states on the honeycomb lattice. We provide the fusion
rules of the quasiparticle (QP) excitations of the model by introducing single-

the corresponding fusion outcome. Beside, we extract the TEE from Renyi
entanglement entropy (EE) of the TCC, analytically and numerically by finite
size exact diagonalization on the disk shape regions with contractible
boundaries. We obtain that the EE has a local contribution, which scales
linearly with the boundary length in addition to a topological term, i.e. the
TEE, arising from the condensation of closed strings in the ground state. We
further investigate the ground state dependence of the TEE on regions with
non-contractible boundaries, i.e. by cutting the torus to half cylinders, from
which we further identify multiple independent minimum entropy states (MES) of
the TCC and then extract the U and S modular matrices of the system, which
contain the self and mutual statistics of the anyonic QPs and fully
characterize the topological phase of the TCC. Eventually, we show that, in
spite of the lack of a local order parameter, TEE and other physical quantities
obtained from ground state wave function such as entanglement spectrum (ES) and
ground state fidelity are sensitive probes to study the robustness of a
topological phase. We find that the topological order in the presence of a
magnetic field persists until the vicinity of the transition point, where the
TEE and fidelity drops to zero and the ES splits severely, signaling breakdown
of the topological phase of the TCC.

cosine-similarity, based on word overlap, mostly fail to produce good results
in this case, since word overlap is little or non-existent. Recently,
distributed word representations, or word embeddings, have been shown to
successfully allow words to match on the semantic level. In order to pair short
text fragments - as a concatenation of separate words - an adequate distributed
sentence representation is needed, in existing literature often obtained by
naively combining the individual word representations. We therefore
investigated several text representations as a combination of word embeddings
in the context of semantic pair matching. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of several such naive techniques, as well as traditional tf-idf
similarity, for fragments of different lengths. Our main contribution is a
first step towards a hybrid method that combines the strength of dense
distributed representations - as opposed to sparse term matching - with the
strength of tf-idf based methods to automatically reduce the impact of less
informative terms. Our new approach outperforms the existing techniques in a
toy experimental set-up, leading to the conclusion that the combination of word
embeddings and tf-idf information might lead to a better model for semantic

vertices of $\Pi.$ First we construct $\Pi$ by attaching Platonic solids in a
periodic manner and consider the surface of this solid. Due to periodicity we
can find a compact quotient of this surface, which has genus $g = 3.$ We claim
that the resulting surface is not hyperelliptic and also that it is regular. By
regular, we mean that the automorphism group of $X$ is transitive on flags. The
symmetries of $X$ allow us to construct hyperbolic structures and various
translation structures on $X$ that are compatible with its conformal type. The
translation structures are the geometric representations of the holomorphic
1-forms of $X,$ which allow us to identify the Weierstrass points.

often assumed to be in equipartition, allowing for an indirect estimate of the
magnetic field strength from the observed radio synchrotron spectrum. However,
both primary and secondary CRs contribute to the synchrotron spectrum, and the
CR electrons also loose energy via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton. While
classical equipartition formulae avoid these intricacies, there have been
recent revisions that account for the extreme conditions in starbursts. Yet,
the application of the equipartition formula to starburst environments also
presupposes that timescales are long enough to reach equilibrium. Here, we test
equipartition in the central molecular zones (CMZs) of nearby starburst
galaxies by modeling the observed gamma-ray spectra, which provide a direct
measure of the CR energy density, and the radio spectra, which provide a probe
of the magnetic field strength. We find that in starbursts, the magnetic field
energy density is significantly larger than the CR energy density,
demonstrating that the equipartition argument is frequently invalid for CMZs.

the entanglement entropy everywhere along the RG trajectory. In $4$ dimensions,
a free non-conformal scalar has a universal area term scaling with the

$1/\epsilon$. For a non-conformal scalar, a $1/\epsilon$ term is present both

replica trick calculations. The conical singularity gives rise to boundary
terms residing on the entangling surface, which are usually discarded.

Consequently, each cluster contains a negligible fraction of the total number

of electrons from the helix to the environment, via additional outgoing leads.
Technically, the leakage generates complex site self-energies, which break
unitarity. As a result, the electron waves in the helix become evanescent, with
different decay lengths for different spin polarizations, yielding a net spin
polarization of the outgoing electrons, which increases with the length of the

change their internal state, and produce output. For example, one may model
anything from neurons to robots in this way. Several open dynamical systems can
be arranged in series, in parallel, and with feedback to form a new dynamical
system---this is called compositionality---and the process can be repeated in a
fractal-like manner to form more complex systems of systems. One issue is that
as larger systems are created, their state space grows exponentially.
  In this paper a technique for calculating the steady states of an
interconnected system of systems, in terms of the steady states of its
component dynamical systems, is provided. These are organized into ""steady
state matrices"" which generalize bifurcation diagrams. It is shown that the
compositionality structure of dynamical systems fits with the familiar monoidal
structure for the steady state matrices, where serial, parallel, and feedback
composition of matrices correspond to multiplication, Kronecker product, and
partial trace operations. The steady state matrices of dynamical systems
respect this compositionality structure, exponentially reducing the complexity
involved in studying the steady states of composite dynamical systems.

greatly enhanced when the transition is crossed at fixed, integer filling, due
to a richer entanglement spectrum containing an additional gapless mode, which
descends from the amplitude (Higgs) mode of the global excitation spectrum --

smaller in terms of the number of lattice sites. It has been shown that using
open boundary conditions in time allows instantons to be created and destroyed,
restoring topological mobility and ergodicity. However, with open boundary
conditions translational invariance is lost and the influence of spurious
states propagating from the boundary into the bulk on physical correlators
needs to be carefully evaluated. Moreover, while the total topological charge
can be changed, the mobility of instantons across the lattice is still reduced.

inference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a

random-effects analysis implemented by the $t$-test does provide population
inference if applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case
of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures, because the
true value of such measures can never be below chance level. This constraint
changes the meaning of the population-level null hypothesis being tested, which
becomes equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect in any
subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that
there are some subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that
it generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis.
This statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We
review possible alternative approaches to population inference for
information-based imaging, converging on the idea that it should not target the
mean, but the prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so,
'permutation-based information prevalence inference using the minimum
statistic', is described in detail and applied to empirical data.

essentially rely on changes of the refractive index, that is on scalar
properties of light. Recently, processes based on ""geometric Berry phases"",
such as manipulation of polarization states or deflection of spinning-light
rays, have attracted considerable interest in the contexts of singular optics
and structured light. Here, we disclose a new approach to light waveguiding,
using geometric Berry phases and exploiting polarization states and their
handling. This can be realized in structured three-dimensional anisotropic
media, in which the optic axis lies orthogonal to the propagation direction and
is modulated along it and across the transverse plane, so that the refractive
index remains constant but a phase distortion can be imposed on a beam. In
addition to a complete theoretical analysis with numerical simulations, we
present a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of this effect in a
discrete element implementation of a geometric phase waveguide. The mechanism
we introduce shows that spin-orbit optical interactions can play an important
role in integrated optics and paves the way to an entire new class of photonic
systems that exploit the vectorial nature of light.

To appear in The Annals of Statistics",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For long-memory time series, inference based on resampling is of crucial
importance, since the asymptotic distribution can often be non-Gaussian and is
difficult to determine statistically. However due to the strong dependence,
establishing the asymptotic validity of resampling methods is nontrivial. In
this paper, we derive an efficient bound for the canonical correlation between
two finite blocks of a long-memory time series. We show how this bound can be
applied to establish the asymptotic consistency of subsampling procedures for
general statistics under long memory. It allows the subsample size $b$ to be
$o(n)$, where $n$ is the sample size, irrespective of the strength of the
memory. We are then able to improve many results found in the literature. We
also consider applications of subsampling procedures under long memory to the
sample covariance, M-estimation and empirical processes.

on top of the simple match-action paradigm offered by OpenFlow 1.0. However,
emerging hardware and software switches offer much more sophisticated support
for persistent state in the data plane, without involving a central controller.
Nevertheless, managing stateful, distributed systems efficiently and correctly
is known to be one of the most challenging programming problems. To simplify
this new SDN problem, we introduce SNAP.
  SNAP offers a simpler ""centralized"" stateful programming model, by allowing
programmers to develop programs on top of one big switch rather than many.
These programs may contain reads and writes to global, persistent arrays, and
as a result, programmers can implement a broad range of applications, from
stateful firewalls to fine-grained traffic monitoring. The SNAP compiler
relieves programmers of having to worry about how to distribute, place, and
optimize access to these stateful arrays by doing it all for them. More
specifically, the compiler discovers read/write dependencies between arrays and
translates one-big-switch programs into an efficient internal representation
based on a novel variant of binary decision diagrams. This internal
representation is used to construct a mixed-integer linear program, which
jointly optimizes the placement of state and the routing of traffic across the
underlying physical topology. We have implemented a prototype compiler and
applied it to about 20 SNAP programs over various topologies to demonstrate our
techniques' scalability.

analyzing channel and joint source-channel coding in a multi-terminal discrete

the source (combination of messages and codewords) into a sub-exponential
number of subsets. Over each of these subsets, the exponential orders of the
minimum image sizes of most messages are roughly equal to the same entropy
term. This property gives us the strength of minimum image sizes and the
flexibility of entropy terms. Using the method of equal-image-size source
partitioning, we prove separate necessary conditions for the existence of
average-error and maximum-error codes. These necessary conditions are much
stronger than the standard Fano's inequality, and can be weakened to render
versions of Fano's inequality that apply to codes with non-vanishing error
probabilities. To demonstrate the power of this new tool, we employ the
stronger average-error version of Fano's inequality to prove the strong
converse for the discrete memoryless wiretap channel with decaying leakage,
which heretofore has been an open problem.

estimation of time-varying spectral densities from nonstationary time series.
Time-varying spectral densities are commonly estimated by local kernel
smoothing. The performance of these nonparametric estimators, however, depends
crucially on the smoothing bandwidths that need to be specified in both time
and frequency direction. As an alternative and extension to traditional
bandwidth selection methods, we propose an iterative algorithm for constructing
localized smoothing kernels data-adaptively. The main idea, inspired by the
concept of propagation-separation (Polzehl and Spokoiny 2006), is to determine
for a point in the time-frequency plane the largest local vicinity over which
smoothing is justified by the data. By shaping the smoothing kernels
nonparametrically, our method not only avoids the problem of bandwidth
selection in the strict sense but also becomes more flexible. It not only
adapts to changing curvature in smoothly varying spectra but also adjusts for
structural breaks in the time-varying spectrum.

boundary effects. We also consider a definition of local pressure, which
describes interparticle forces in terms of momentum exchange between different
regions of the system. We present three pieces of analytical evidence which
indicate that such a local pressure exists, and we show that its bulk value
differs from the mechanical pressure exerted on the walls of the system. We
attribute this difference to the fact that the local pressure in the bulk does
not depend on boundary effects, contrary to the mechanical pressure. We
carefully examine these boundary effects using a channel geometry, and we show
a virial formula for the pressure correctly predicts the mechanical pressure
even in finite channels. However, this result no longer holds in more complex
geometries, as exemplified for a channel that includes circular obstacles.

(MRI) and dynamo action have been suggested as a mechanism to grow
magnetar-strength magnetic field ($\ge10^{15} G$) and magnetorotationally power
the explosion of a rotating massive star. Such stars are progenitor candidates
for type Ic-bl hypernova explosions and make up all supernovae connected to
long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The MRI has been studied with local
high-resolution shearing box simulations in 3D or with global 2D simulations,
but it is an open question whether MRI-driven turbulence can result in the
creation of a large-scale ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we
report results from global 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
turbulence simulations and show that MRI-driven MHD turbulence in rapidly

large-scale ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of
bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that
rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl

helicity ($\sigma^+$ or $\sigma^-$) is locked to the valley degree of freedom,
leading to the possibility of optical initialization of distinct valley
populations. However, an extremely rapid valley pseudospin relaxation (at the
time scale of picoseconds) occurring for optically bright (electric-dipole
active) excitons imposes some limitations on the development of
opto-valleytronics. Here we show that inter-valley scattering of excitons can
be significantly suppressed in a $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ monolayer, a direct-gap
two-dimensional semiconductor with the exciton ground state being optically
dark. We demonstrate that the already inefficient relaxation of the exciton
pseudospin in such system can be suppressed even further by the application of
a tiny magnetic field of $\sim$100 mT. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals the
pseudospin dynamics to be a two-step relaxation process. An initial decay of
the pseudospin occurs at the level of dark excitons on a time scale of 100 ps,
which is tunable with a magnetic field. This decay is followed by even longer
decay ($>1$ ns), once the dark excitons form more complex objects allowing for
their radiative recombination. Our finding of slow valley pseudospin relaxation
easily manipulated by the magnetic field open new prospects for engineering the

thermal state and subsequent measurements of two photons a time $\tau \geq 0$
apart. The generation of the Gaussian state by the parametric amplifier ensures
that the temporal second-order coherence function depends only on $\tau$, via
$\tau/t$, for given Gaussian state parameters, Gaussian state preparation time
$t$, and average number $\bar{n}$ of thermal photons. It is interesting that
the time evolution for displaced thermal states shows a power decay in $\tau/t$
rather than an exponential one as is the case for general, displaced-squeezed
thermal states.

composite model with two continuum components - a black body emission with the
temperature about 1 keV at low energies and a power law with an exponential

of 4.5 to ensure a low contamination rate by false cluster candidates. This
means that only the most massive clusters at redshift z>0.5, and in particular
z>0.7, are expected to enter into the catalogue, with a large number of systems
in that redshift regime being expected around and just below that threshold. In
this paper, we follow-up a sample of SZ sources from the Planck SZ catalogues
from 2013 and 2015. In the latter maps, we consider detections around and at
lower significance than the threshold adopted by the Planck Collaboration. To
keep the contamination rate low, our 28 candidates are chosen to have
significant WISE detections, in combination with non-detections in SDSS/DSS,
which effectively selects galaxy cluster candidates at redshifts $z\gtrsim0.5$.
By taking r- and z-band imaging with MegaCam@CFHT, we bridge the 4000A
rest-frame break over a significant redshift range, thus allowing accurate
redshift estimates of red-sequence cluster galaxies up to z~0.8. After
discussing the possibility that an overdensity of galaxies coincides -by
chance- with a Planck SZ detection, we confirm that 16 of the candidates have
likely optical counterparts to their SZ signals, 13 (6) of which have an
estimated redshift z>0.5 (z>0.7). The richnesses of these systems are generally
lower than expected given the halo masses estimated from the Planck maps.
However, when we follow a simplistic model to correct for Eddington bias in the
SZ halo mass proxy, the richnesses are consistent with a reference
mass-richness relation established for clusters detected at higher
significance. This illustrates the benefit of an optical follow-up, not only to
obtain redshift estimates, but also to provide an independent mass proxy that
is not based on the same data the clusters are detected with, and thus not
subject to Eddington bias.

complete galaxy survey to L > 0.01 L* or stellar mass log M_* > 8 Msun. We
report two principal findings. First, for galaxies with impact parameter rho <
1 rvir, C IV detection strongly depends on the luminosity/stellar mass of the
nearby galaxy. C IV is preferentially associated with galaxies with log M_* >
9.5 Msun; lower mass galaxies rarely exhibit significant C IV absorption
(covering fraction f = 9 +12-6% for 11 galaxies with log M_* < 9.5 Msun).
Second, C IV detection within the log M_* > 9.5 Msun population depends on
environment. Using a fixed-aperture environmental density metric for galaxies
with rho < 160 kpc at z < 0.055, we find that 57+/-12% (8/14) of galaxies in
low-density regions (regions with fewer than seven L > 0.15 L* galaxies within
1.5 Mpc) have affiliated C IV absorption; however, none (0/7) of the galaxies
in denser regions show C IV. Similarly, the C IV detection rate is lower for
galaxies residing in groups with dark-matter halo masses of log Mhalo > 12.5
Msun. In contrast to C IV, H I is pervasive in the CGM without regard to mass
or environment. These results indicate that C IV absorbers with log N(C IV) >

the geometrical implication of theories which display a manifest matter parity

the lepton number assignment of the right-handed neutrino fields. We find that
the traditional R-parity assignments of the MSSM more readily accommodate the
neutrino see-saw mechanism with non-trivial geometry than those superpotentials

for a fundamental Higgs bilinear in the superpotential, with operators that
violate lepton number, such as \nu H\bar{H}, generating vacuum moduli spaces
equivalent to those with a fundamental bilinear.

genuine $(3+1)$-dimensional perfect black-body emitters. In particular, the

which surrounds the black hole and effectively blocks the emission of
low-energy quanta. Taking into account the energy-dependent gray-body factors

(XSAT) problem, which belongs to the important NP-complete complexity class.
The algorithm is based on an intuitive approach that can be divided into two
parts: First, the identification and efficient characterization of a restricted
subspace that contains all the valid assignments of the XSAT; Second, a quantum
search in such restricted subspace. The quantum algorithm can be used either to
find a valid assignment (or to certify that no solution exists) or to count the
total number of valid assignments. The query complexities for the worst-case
are respectively bounded by $O(\sqrt{2^{n-M^{\prime}}})$ and
$O(2^{n-M^{\prime}})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $M^{\prime}$
the number of linearly independent clauses. Remarkably, the proposed quantum
algorithm results to be faster than any known exact classical algorithm to
solve dense formulas of XSAT. As a concrete application, we provide the
worst-case complexity for the Hamiltonian cycle problem obtained after mapping
it to a suitable XSAT. Specifically, we show that the time complexity for the
proposed quantum algorithm is bounded by $O(2^{n/4})$ for 3-regular undirected
graphs, where $n$ is the number of nodes. The same worst-case complexity holds
for $(3,3)$-regular bipartite graphs (the current best classical algorithm has
a (worst-case) running time bounded by $O(2^{31n/96})$). Finally, when compared
to heuristic techniques for XSAT, the proposed quantum algorithm is faster than
the classical WalkSAT and Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for random instances
with a density of constraints close to the satisfiability threshold, the regime
in which instances are typically the hardest to solve. The proposed quantum
algorithm can be also extended to the generalized version of the XSAT known as
Occupation problem.

change from an attenuated Lya line to a strong Lya emission line), recent

low-redshift highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies that breaks this trend. We
aim to understand how a strong Lya emission line is able to escape from one of
those inclined disk galaxies, named Mrk1486 (z=0.0338). For that purpose we
used a large set of HST imaging and spectroscopic data to investigate both the
ISM structure and the dominant source of Lya radiation inside Mrk1486.
Moreover, we used a 3D Monte Carlo Lya radiation transfer code to study the
radiative transfer of Lya and UV continuum photons inside a 3D geometry of
neutral hydrogen (HI) and dust that models the ISM structure at the galaxy
center. The analysis of IFU Halpha spectroscopic data of Mrk1486 indicates the
presence of two bipolar galactic winds of HI gas above and bellow the disk

we find that the Lya production of Mrk1486 is dominated by photoionization
inside the galaxy disk. From this perspective, our numerical simulations
succeed in reproducing the strength and spectral shape of the observed Lya line
of Mrk1486 by assuming a scenario in which the Lya photons are produced inside
the disk, travel along the galactic winds and scatter on cool HI materials
toward the observer. As bipolar galactic winds are ubiquitous in star-forming
disk galaxies, this mechanism may explain the origin of strong Lya emission
lines recently observed from highly inclined galaxies at high-redshift.

semi-metallic phase transition in this crystal structure. The obtained Weyl
semi-metallic phase exists in the 4.0 - 6.0 GPa pressure range. We find that a
total 6 pairs of Weyl points, 6 monopoles and 6 antimonopoles, exist in the

different energy values yielding separate electron and hole Fermi-surfaces.
Additionally, the spin-texture of the bulk BiSb compound appears to be
electrically controllable when the interlink between pressure and an electric

properties in this system which are very promising for implementation of this
kind of materials in next-generation Weyltronics and spintronic devices.

cometary-like structure. Its main morphological features consist of a bow
shaped shell, which surrounds the central star, accompanied by a long
collimated tail. In this study we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations modeling the formation of HFG1 from the interaction of the local
ambient medium with the mass outflows of its Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
progenitor star. We attribute the cometary appearance of HFG1 to the systemic
motion of the PN with respect to the local ambient medium. Due to its vital
importance, we re-estimate the distance of HFG1 by modeling the spectral energy
distribution of its central star, V664 Cas, and we find a distance of $ 490 \pm
50$ pc. Our simulations show that none of our models with time invariant
stellar wind and ambient medium properties are able to reproduce simultaneously
the extended bow shock and the collimated tail observed in HFG1. Given this, we
increase the complexity of our modeling considering that the stellar wind is
time variable. The wind description is based on the predictions of the AGB and
post-AGB evolution models. Testing a grid of models we find that the properties
of HFG1 are best reproduced by the mass outflows of a 3 Msun AGB star. Such a
scenario is consistent with the current observed properties of V664 Cas primary
star, an O-type subdwarf, and bridges the evolutionary history of HFG1 central
star with the observables of the PN. We discuss the implications of our study

suited for this work due to the high cadence (up to 0.5s), high spatial

We find that the observed intensity ratio between lines of three times ionized

correlation varies depending on the region observed (quiet sun, coronal holes,
plage or active regions) and on the specific observational objects present
(spicules, dynamic loops, jets, micro-flares or umbra). In order to interpret
the observations, we compare them with synthetic profiles taken from 2D
self-consistent radiative MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere, where the
statistical equilibrium or non-equilibrium treatment silicon and oxygen is
applied. These synthetic observations show vaguely similar correlations as in
the observations, i.e. between the intensity ratios and their intensities, but
only in the non-equilibrium case do we find that (some of) the observations can

  Communications from the Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of
  Sciences",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Among the tens of thousands of known RR Lyrae stars there are only a handful
that show indications of possible binarity. The question why this is the case
is still unsolved, and has recently sparked several studies dedicated to the
search for additional RR Lyraes in binary systems. Such systems are
particularly valuable because they might allow to constrain the stellar mass.
Most of the recent studies, however, are based on photometry by finding a light
time effect in the timings of maximum light. This approach is a very promising
and successful one, but it has a major drawback: by itself, it cannot serve as
a definite proof of binarity, because other phenomena such as the Blazhko
effect or intrinsic period changes could lead to similar results. Spectroscopic
radial velocity measurements, on the other hand, can serve as definite proof of
binarity. We have therefore started a project to study spectroscopically RR
Lyrae stars that are suspected to be binaries. We have obtained radial velocity
(RV) curves with the 2.1m telescope at McDonald observatory. From these we
derive systemic RVs which we will compare to previous measurements in order to
find changes induced by orbital motions. We also construct templates of the RV
curves that can facilitate future studies. We also observed the most promising
RR Lyrae binary candidate, TU UMa, as no recent spectroscopic measurements were
available. We present a densely covered pulsational RV curve, which will be
used to test the predictions of the orbit models that are based on the O-C
variations.

frequencies, one of which is associated with the 66.7 d orbital period of the

variations that are 180 degrees out-of-phase with the radial velocity
variations of GL 581d. This is seen in thefull data set that spans almost 7
years, as well as a subset of the data that had good temporal sampling over 230

the hypothesis that indeterminism manifests as a consequence of unavoidable

today technology advance requires energy saving. Heat integration is a method

Exchanger Network (HEN). CPT is one of types of Heat Exchanger Network (HEN)
that functions to recover the heat in the flow of product or waste. HEN
comprises a number of heat exchangers (HEs) that are serially connected.
However, the presence of fouling in the heat exchanger has caused the decline
of the performance of both heat exchangers and all heat exchanger networks.
Fouling can not be avoided. However, it can be mitigated. In industry, periodic
heat exchanger cleaning is the most effective and widely used mitigation
technique. On the other side, a very frequent cleaning of heat exchanger can be
much costly in maintenance and lost of production. In this way, an accurate
optimization technique of cleaning schedule interval of heat exchanger is very
essential. Commonly, this technique involves three elements: model to simulate
the heat exchanger network, representative fouling model to describe the
fouling behavior and suitable optimization algorithm to solve the problem of
clening schedule interval for heat exchanger network. This paper describe the
optimization of interval cleaning schedule of HEN within the 44-month period
using PSO (particle swarm optimization). The number of iteration used to
achieve the convergent is 100 iterations and the fitness value in PSO
correlated with the amount of heat recovery, cleaning cost, and additional
pumping cost. The saving after the optimization of cleaning schedule of HEN in
this research achieved at $ 1.236 millions or 23% of maximum potential savings.

  ""Bottle""","21 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A method proposed for measuring the electric dipole moment (EDM) of a charged
fundamental particle such as the proton, is to measure the spin precession
caused by a radial electric bend field $E_r$, acting on the EDMs of frozen spin
polarized protons circulating in an all-electric storage ring. The dominant
systematic error limiting such a measurement comes from spurious spin
precession caused by unintentional and unknown average radial magnetic field
$B_r$ acting on the (vastly larger) magnetic dipole moments (MDM) of the
protons. Along with taking extreme magnetic shielding measures, the best
protection against this systematic error is to use the storage ring itself, as
a ""self-magnetometer""; the exact magnetic field average $\langle B_r\rangle$
that produces systematic EDM error, is nulled to exquisite precision by orbit
position control.
  By using octupole rather than quadrupole focusing the restoring force can be
vanishingly small for small amplitude vertical betatron-like motion yet strong
enough at large amplitudes to keep all particles captured. This greatly
enhances the magnetometer sensitivity. Any average radial magnetic field error
$\langle\Delta B_r\rangle$ causes a vertical orbit shift between CW and CCW
beams. Self-magnetometry measures this shift, enabling its cancellation. For
the octupole-only ring proposed here the accuracy of magnetic field control is
$\langle\Delta B_r\rangle\approx \pm 3\times10^{-16}\,$Tesla. This is small
enough to reduce the systematic error in the proton EDM measurement into a
range where realistically small deviations from standard model predictions can
be measured.
  Though novel, the theoretical analysis given here for relativistic bottles,
magnetic or electric or both, is elementary, and their behavior is predicted to
be entirely satisfactory.

initial binary nucleon-nucleon collisions by using the PYTHIA event generator
taking into account the (anti-)shadowing incorporated in the EPS09 package. The
produced charm quarks interact with off-shell massive partons in the
quark-gluon plasma and are hadronized into $D$ mesons through coalescence or
fragmentation close to the critical energy density, and then interact with
hadrons in the final hadronic stage with scattering cross sections calculated
in an effective Lagrangian approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry. The PHSD
results show a reasonable $R_{\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow of $D$ mesons in
comparison to the experimental data for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =

affected by off-shell charm degrees of freedom. However, the position of the
peak of $R_{\rm AA}$ for $D$ mesons depends on the strength of the scalar
partonic forces which also have an impact on the $D$ meson elliptic flow. The
comparison with experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ suggests that the
repulsive force is weaker for off-shell charm quarks as compared to that for

retrieval. In this work, we characterize stable fixed points of general
threshold-linear networks with constant external drive, and discover
constraints on the co-existence of fixed points involving different subsets of
active neurons. In the case of symmetric networks, we prove the following
antichain property: if a set of neurons $\tau$ is the support of a stable fixed
point, then no proper subset or superset of $\tau$ can support a stable fixed
point. Symmetric threshold-linear networks thus appear to be well suited for
pattern completion, since the dynamics are guaranteed not to get ""stuck"" in a
subset or superset of a stored pattern. We also show that for any graph G, we
can construct a network whose stable fixed points correspond precisely to the
maximal cliques of G. As an application, we design network decoders for place
field codes, and demonstrate their efficacy for error correction and pattern
completion. The proofs of our main results build on the theory of permitted

reconstructing the ROI source signals from simulated data, STFT-R achieved
smaller errors than a two-step method using the popular minimum-norm estimate

interpretable results about what time-frequency components of the ROI signals

decomposes asymptotically into a sum of solitary waves centered at the vertices
of a K-sided regular polygon and concentrating at a logarithmic rate in large

up in finite time with a rate strictly above the pseudo-conformal one. Such

phases of the ISM to the [CII] emission from clouds near the dynamical center
and the BCLMP302 HII region in the north of the nearby galaxy M33 at a spatial
resolution of 50pc. We combine high resolution [CII] spectra taken with the
HIFI spectrometer onboard the Herschel satellite with [CII] Herschel-PACS maps
and ground-based observations of CO(2-1) and HI. All data are at a common
spatial resolution of 50pc. Typically, the [CII] lines have widths intermediate
between the narrower CO(2-1) and broader HI line profiles. We decomposed the
[CII] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detected
in CO(2-1) and HI, respectively. We find that the relative contribution of
molecular and atomic gas traced by CO(2-1) and HI varies depends mostly on the
local physical conditions and geometry. We estimate that 11-60% and 5-34% of
the [CII] intensities in the center and in BCLMP302, respectively, arise at
velocities showing no CO(2-1) or HI emission and could arise in CO-dark
molecular gas. The deduced strong variation in the [CII] emission not
associated with CO and HI cannot be explained in terms of differences in A_v,
far-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studied
regions. Hence the relative amounts of diffuse (CO-dark) and dense molecular
gas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50pc. Based on the emission
measure observed at radio wavelengths we estimate the contribution of ionized
gas at a few positions to lie between 10-25%. The correlations between the
intensities of tracers corresponding to the same velocity range as [CII],
differ from the correlation derived from PACS data. The results in this paper
emphasize the need for velocity-resolved observations to discern the

problem in data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The goal
of unfolding is to make nonparametric inferences about a particle spectrum from
measurements smeared by the finite resolution of the particle detectors.
Previous unfolding methods use ad hoc discretization and regularization,
resulting in confidence intervals that can have significantly lower coverage
than their nominal level. Instead of regularizing using a roughness penalty or
stopping iterative methods early, we impose physically motivated shape
constraints: positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. We quantify the
uncertainty by constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true
spectrum, consisting of all those spectra that satisfy the shape constraints
and that predict the observations within an appropriately calibrated level of
fit. Projecting that set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all
functionals of the spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence
intervals have guaranteed conservative frequentist finite-sample coverage in
the important and challenging class of unfolding problems for steeply falling
particle spectra. We demonstrate the method using simulations that mimic
unfolding the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. The
shape-constrained intervals provide usefully tight conservative inferences,
while the conventional methods suffer from severe undercoverage.

subspaces are assigned membership to their respective subspaces. This paper
presents a new approach dubbed Innovation Pursuit (iPursuit) to the problem of
subspace clustering using a new geometrical idea whereby subspaces are
identified based on their relative novelties. We present two frameworks in
which the idea of innovation pursuit is used to distinguish the subspaces.
Underlying the first framework is an iterative method that finds the subspaces
consecutively by solving a series of simple linear optimization problems, each
searching for a direction of innovation in the span of the data potentially
orthogonal to all subspaces except for the one to be identified in one step of
the algorithm. A detailed mathematical analysis is provided establishing
sufficient conditions for iPursuit to correctly cluster the data. The proposed
approach can provably yield exact clustering even when the subspaces have
significant intersections. It is shown that the complexity of the iterative
approach scales only linearly in the number of data points and subspaces, and
quadratically in the dimension of the subspaces. The second framework
integrates iPursuit with spectral clustering to yield a new variant of
spectral-clustering-based algorithms. The numerical simulations with both real
and synthetic data demonstrate that iPursuit can often outperform the
state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms, more so for subspaces with
significant intersections, and that it significantly improves the
state-of-the-art result for subspace-segmentation-based face clustering.

strategies used to measure the velocity dispersions and account for systematic
effects resulting from these strategies. We find that the galaxy velocity
distributions may be treated as isotropic, and that an aperture correction of
up to 7 per cent in the velocity dispersion is required if the spectroscopic
galaxy sample is sufficiently concentrated towards the cluster centre.
Accounting for the radial profile of the velocity dispersion in simulations
enables consistent dynamical mass estimates regardless of the observing
strategy. Cluster masses $M_{200}$ are in the range
$(1-15)\times10^{14}M_\odot$. Comparing with masses estimated from the SZ
distortion assuming a gas pressure profile derived from X-ray observations
gives a mean SZ-to-dynamical mass ratio of $1.10\pm0.13$, but there is an
additional 0.14 systematic uncertainty due to the unknown velocity bias; the
statistical uncertainty is dominated by the scatter in the mass-velocity
dispersion scaling relation. This ratio is consistent with previous
determinations at these mass scales.

resonant waves with spatially localized amplitude maximum. As observations show
the constraint satisfaction of KHI development is quite rare. SI in solar wind
dynamic pressure generate ULF waves with different polarization and frequency

the Swift BAT triggers on weaker SGRBs than Fermi GBM, providing they occur
close to the center of the BAT field-of-view, and that the Fermi GBM SGRB
detection threshold remains flatter across its field-of-view. Overall, these
effects combine to give the instruments the same average sensitivity, and
account for the SGRBs that trigger one instrument but not the other. We do not
find any evidence that the BAT and GBM are detecting significantly different
populations of SGRBs. Both instruments can detect untriggered SGRBs using
ground searches seeded with time and position. The detection of SGRBs below the
on-board triggering sensitivities of Swift BAT and Fermi GBM increases the
possibility of detecting and localizing the electromagnetic counterparts of
gravitational wave events seen by the new generation of gravitational wave

terms of its role in the warming of the climate system. Based on two reasonable
assumptions of (1) AHE eventually transfers to the Earth energy system and (2)
the net warming is only driven by the net radioactive forcing (RF) from either
GHG or other causes, we analyzed the role of AHE in global warming. The mean
annual total AHE of the four main sources including energy consumption,
residual heat of electricity generation, biomass decomposition by land use and
cover change (LUCC) and food consumption was estimated to be 4.41*10^20 J in
1970-2010, accounting for 6.23% of the net annual heat increase of the Earth
reported by IPCC AR5 for the period. The mean annual radioactive forcing (RF)
by AHE was up to 29.94 mW m^(-2) globally in 1981-2010, less than the annual
net increase of total GHG (34.80 mW m^(-2)) but more that of CO2 (24.43 mW
m^(-2). The results suggested that AHE played a great role in global warming,
urging us to pay more attention to DHE for a better evaluation of RF and more
reasonable energy policy including non-GHG energy in the future (Keywords:

mode, in the presence of dissipation. Previous work has shown that in the limit
of weak driving fields, the steady state entanglement is proportional to the
square of the driving intensity. This quadratic dependence is due to the
generation of entanglement by the creation of pairs of photons/excitations. In
this work we investigate the entanglement between an atom and a cavity in the
presence of multiple photons. Nonlinearity of the atomic response is needed to
generate entanglement, but as that nonlinearity saturates the entanglement
vanishes. We posit that this is due to spontaneous emission, which puts the
atom in the ground state and the atom-field state into a direct product state.
An intermediate value of the driving field, near the field that saturates the
atomic response, optimizes the atom-field entanglement. In a parameter regime
for which multiphoton resonances occur, we find that entanglement recurs at
those resonances. \cite{Shamailov-10} In this regime, we find that the
entanglement decreases with increaing photon number. We also investigate, in
the bimodal regime of Alsing et. al.\cite{Alsing-91-DressedState}
\cite{Alsing-92-DSS}\cite{Carm-15-X}, the entanglement as a function of atom
and/or cavity detuning. Here we find that there is evidence of a phase

into an optical lattice at ultralow temperature. One species is two-component
atoms, which can hop in the optical lattice, and the other is single-component
atoms, which are localized. Different correlation-driven metal-insulator
transitions are observed depending on the atom filling conditions and local
interactions. These metal-insulator transitions are classified by the band
renormalization factors and the double occupancies of the atom species. The
filling conditions and the critical value of the local interactions for these
metal-insulator transitions are also analytically established. The obtained
results not only are in good agreement with the dynamical mean-field theory for
the three-component Falicov-Kimball model but also clarify the nature and
properties of the metal-insulator transitions in a simple physics picture.

lifestyles, land use and infrastructure systems of cities. Thus, as most of the
world's cities continue to grow and develop, understanding the interplay
between the characteristics of urban environments and the built form of cities
is essential to achieve local and global sustainability goals. Here, we compile
and analyze the most extensive data set of building shapes to date, covering
more than 4.8 million individual buildings across several major cities in North
America. We show that average building height increases systematically with
city size and follows theoretical predictions derived from urban scaling
theory. We also study the allometric relationship between surface area and
volume of buildings in terms of characteristic shape parameters. This allows us
to demonstrate that the reported trend towards higher (and more voluminous)
buildings effectively decreases the average surface-to-volume ratio, suggesting
potentially significant energy savings with growing city size. At the same
time, however, the surface-to-volume ratio increases in the downtown cores of
large cities, due to shape effects and specifically to the proliferation of
tall, needlelike buildings. Thus, the issue of changes in building shapes with
city size and associated energy management problem is highly heterogeneous. It
requires a systematic approach that includes the factors that drive the form of
built environments, entangling physical, infrastructural and socioeconomic

limitations, we develop sparse structural equation models (SEMs) as a general
framework for a new paradigm of genetic analysis of multiple phenotypes. To
incorporate both common and rare variants into the analysis, we extend the
traditional multivariate SEMs to sparse functional SEMs. To deal with high

the alternative direction methods of multiplier (ADMM) techniques to reduce

test for interaction between two gens in multiple quantitative trait analysis
as a multiple functional regression (MFRG) in which the genotype functions

the genetic variants. We use large scale simulations to calculate its type I

single trait interaction analysis by a single variate functional regression

applied to five phenotypes and exome sequence data from the NHLBI Exome

of genes that formed a genetic interaction network showed significant evidence

interaction than the interaction analysis of single trait and may open a new

structures guide our action planning and execution, but when we observe others,
the latent structure of their actions is typically unobservable, and must be
inferred in order to learn new skills by demonstration, or to assist others in
completing their tasks. For example, an assistant who has learned the subgoal
structure of a colleague's task can more rapidly recognize and support their
actions as they unfold. Here we model how humans infer subgoals from
observations of complex action sequences using a nonparametric Bayesian model,
which assumes that observed actions are generated by approximately rational
planning over unknown subgoal sequences. We test this model with a behavioral
experiment in which humans observed different series of goal-directed actions,
and inferred both the number and composition of the subgoal sequences
associated with each goal. The Bayesian model predicts human subgoal inferences
with high accuracy, and significantly better than several alternative models
and straightforward heuristics. Motivated by this result, we simulate how
learning and inference of subgoals can improve performance in an artificial
user assistance task. The Bayesian model learns the correct subgoals from fewer
observations, and better assists users by more rapidly and accurately inferring

natural language (NL) query on a knowledge-base (KB) for answers. Basically,
Neural Enquirer finds the distributed representation of a query and then
executes it on knowledge-base tables to obtain the answer as one of the values
in the tables. Unlike similar efforts in end-to-end training of semantic
parsers, Neural Enquirer is fully ""neuralized"": it not only gives
distributional representation of the query and the knowledge-base, but also
realizes the execution of compositional queries as a series of differentiable
operations, with intermediate results (consisting of annotations of the tables
at different levels) saved on multiple layers of memory. Neural Enquirer can be
trained with gradient descent, with which not only the parameters of the
controlling components and semantic parsing component, but also the embeddings
of the tables and query words can be learned from scratch. The training can be
done in an end-to-end fashion, but it can take stronger guidance, e.g., the
step-by-step supervision for complicated queries, and benefit from it. Neural
Enquirer is one step towards building neural network systems which seek to

propose performing a finite collection of additional Bayesian analyses under

many alternative Bayesian analyses we might consider as informative for our
true judgements so that the method remains tractable even in these cases. We
argue that posterior belief assessment is a tractable and powerful alternative
to robust Bayesian analysis. We describe a methodology for computing posterior
belief assessments in even the most complex of statistical models and
illustrate with an example of calibrating an expensive ocean model in order to

provides relaxation over traditional quadratic Lyapunov based method as there

substitution, the IB feature is determined by $3d$ electronic nature of M^{3+}

possesses half-filled character and suitable subbandgap from valence band or

candidate for IB materials since the resulted IB in it is half filled and extra
absorption peaks occurs in the optical spectrum accompanied with a largely
enhanced light absorption intensity. The result offers a understanding for IB
induced by transition metals into CuAlSe2 and is significant to fabricate the
related IB materials.

wide acceptance of this technique is hindered by its requirement for two
frequency combs and active stabilization of the combs. Here we overcome this
predicament with a Kerr-lens mode-locked bidirectional ring laser that
generates two frequency combs with slightly different pulse repetition rates
and a tunable yet highly stable rate difference. This peculiar lasing principle
builds on a slight difference in optical cavity length between two
counter-propagating lasing modes due to Kerr lensing. Since these combs are
produced by the one and same laser cavity, their relative coherence stays
passively stable without the need for active stabilization. To show its
utility, we demonstrate broadband dual-comb spectroscopy with the single laser.

high-energy pion beam, the $Z_c(3900)$ can be produced off a proton or nucleus
though the Primakoff effect. The production amplitude is calculated in an
effective Lagrangian approach combined with the vector dominance model. The
total cross sections of the $p(\pi^-, Z^-_c(3900))$ and $p(\pi^-,
Z^-_c(3900)\to J/\psi\pi^-)$ reactions are calculated, and their order of
magnitude is about 0.1 and 0.01nb, respectively, with an assumption of branch
ratio 10\% for the $Z_c(3900)$ decay in $J/\psi\pi$ channel. If the proton
target is replaced by a nuclear target, the production of the $Z_c(3900)$
enhances obviously. The predicted total cross sections for the $A(\pi^-,
Z^-_c(3900))$ and $A(\pi^-, Z^-_c(3900)\to J/\psi\pi^-)$ reactions with
$A=^{12}$C or $^{208}$Pb are on the order of magnitude of 100 and 10 nb,
respectively, which is about one thousand times larger than the cross sections
off a proton target. Based on these the results, we suggest the experimental
study of the $Z_c(3900)$ by using high-energy pion beams with a nuclear target
at facilities such as COMPASS and J-PARC.

At room temperature, we also observe strong coupling of the cavity mode to the

of the FMR mode. These observations reveal the extraordinary robustness of the
FMR mode against temperature. However, the MS mode becomes unobservable at room
temperature in the measured transmission spectrum of the microwave cavity
containing the YIG sphere. Our numerical simulations show that this is due to a
drastic increase of the damping rate of the MS mode.

approximated by the convex nuclear norm, the use of nonconvex low-rank
regularizers has demonstrated better recovery performance. However, the
resultant optimization problem is much more challenging. A very recent
state-of-the-art is based on the proximal gradient algorithm. However, it
requires an expensive full SVD in each proximal step. In this paper, we show
that for many commonly-used nonconvex low-rank regularizers, a cutoff can be
derived to automatically threshold the singular values obtained from the
proximal operator. This allows the use of power method to approximate the SVD
efficiently. Besides, the proximal operator can be reduced to that of a much
smaller matrix projected onto this leading subspace. Convergence, with a rate
of O(1/T) where T is the number of iterations, can be guaranteed. Extensive
experiments are performed on matrix completion and robust principal component
analysis. The proposed method achieves significant speedup over the
state-of-the-art. Moreover, the matrix solution obtained is more accurate and
has a lower rank than that of the traditional nuclear norm regularizer.

intermediate mass black holes (10^2 < M_bh/M_sun < 10^5) is not yet clear,
although for the barred Sm galaxy LEDA 87300, Baldassare et al. have recently

spheroidal component of this galaxy. Here we perform a 3-component
bulge+bar+disk decomposition and find a bulge luminosity which is 7.7 times
fainter than the published `bulge' luminosity. After correcting for dust we
find that M_bulge=0.9x10^8 M_sun, and M_bulge/M_disk=0.04 - which is now in
accord with ratios typically found in Scd-Sm galaxies. We go on to discuss
slight revisions to the stellar velocity dispersion (40+/-11 km/s) and black
hole mass (M_bh=2.9x10^4 M_sun) and show that LEDA 87300 remains consistent
with both the M_bh-sigma relation and the near-quadratic M_bh-M_{sph,*}

nonlinear dynamical effects have to be taken into account. Thus, we advocate
the use of light-matter-interaction models also valid for strong light fields

is estimated to be $n_\mathrm{e}$=0.4 cm$^{-3}$. The high-quality observations
presented here reveal spectral variations within different regions in NGC6888,
which allowed us for the first time to detect temperature and/or nitrogen
abundance inhomogeneities in the hot gas inside a WR nebula. One possible
explanation for such spectral variations is that the mixing of material from
the outer nebula into the hot bubble is less efficient around the caps than in
other nebular regions.

The early photometry suggests that SN 1996al is a Linear type-II supernova,
with an absolute peak of Mv ~ -18.2 mag. Early spectra present broad,
asymmetric Balmer emissions, with super-imposed narrow lines with P-Cygni
profile, and He I features with asymmetric, broad emission components. The
analysis of the line profiles shows that the H and He broad components form in
the same region of the ejecta. By day +142, the Halpha profile dramatically
changes: the narrow P-Cygni profile disappears, and the Halpha is fitted by
three emission components, that will be detected over the remaining 15 yrs of
the SN monitoring campaign. Instead, the He I emissions become progressively
narrower and symmetric. A sudden increase in flux of all He I lines is observed
between 300 and 600 days. Models show that the supernova luminosity is
sustained by the interaction of low mass (~1.15 Msun) ejecta, expelled in a low
kinetic energy (~ 1.6 x 10^50 erg) explosion, with highly asymmetric
circumstellar medium. The detection of Halpha emission in pre-explosion archive
images suggests that the progenitor was most likely a massive star (~25 Msun
ZAMS) that had lost a large fraction of its hydrogen envelope before explosion,
and was hence embedded in a H-rich cocoon. The low-mass ejecta and modest
kinetic energy of the explosion are explained with massive fallback of material
into the compact remnant, a 7-8 Msun black hole.

However, NNM tends to over-shrink the rank components and treats the different
rank components equally, limiting its flexibility in practical applications. We
propose a more flexible model, namely the Weighted Schatten $p$-Norm
Minimization (WSNM), to generalize the NNM to the Schatten $p$-norm
minimization with weights assigned to different singular values. The proposed
WSNM not only gives better approximation to the original low-rank assumption,
but also considers the importance of different rank components. We analyze the
solution of WSNM and prove that, under certain weights permutation, WSNM can be
equivalently transformed into independent non-convex $l_p$-norm subproblems,
whose global optimum can be efficiently solved by generalized iterated
shrinkage algorithm. We apply WSNM to typical low-level vision problems, e.g.,
image denoising and background subtraction. Extensive experimental results
show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed WSNM can more
effectively remove noise, and model complex and dynamic scenes compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, we consider the problem of recovering two analog signals, modeled
as general random vectors, from the noiseless sum of linear measurements of the
signals. Our framework is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Wu and Verd\'u
(2010) on analog compression and encompasses, inter alia, inpainting,
declipping, super-resolution, the recovery of signals corrupted by impulse
noise, and the separation of (e.g., audio or video) signals into two distinct
components. The main results we report are general achievability bounds for the
compression rate, i.e., the number of measurements relative to the dimension of
the ambient space the signals live in, under either measurability or H\""older
continuity imposed on the separator. Furthermore, we find a matching converse
for sources of mixed discrete-continuous distribution. For measurable
separators our proofs are based on a new probabilistic uncertainty relation
which shows that the intersection of generic subspaces with general sets of
sufficiently small Minkowski dimension is empty. H\""older continuous separators
are dealt with by introducing the concept of regularized probabilistic
uncertainty relations. The probabilistic uncertainty relations we develop are
inspired by embedding results in dynamical systems theory due to Sauer et al.
(1991) and---conceptually---parallel classical Donoho-Stark and Elad-Bruckstein
uncertainty principles at the heart of compressed sensing theory.
Operationally, the new uncertainty relations take the theory of sparse signal
separation beyond traditional sparsity---as measured in terms of the number of
non-zero entries---to the more general notion of low description complexity as
quantified by Minkowski dimension. Finally, our approach also allows to
significantly strengthen key results in Wu and Verd\'u (2010).

The approach allows to handle a dynamic network in which the number of active
nodes constantly changes and where nodes are heterogeneous in terms of sensor
sensibility and transmission delay. Additionally, the approach allows to keep
the probability of false alarm under control. The statistical approach is
applied to the data collected by three subnetworks related to the cities of
Santiago de Chile, Iquique (Chile) and Kathmandu (Nepal). The detection
capabilities of the approach are discussed in terms of earthquake magnitude and
detection delay. A simulation study is carried out in order to link the

highly parallel construction we call the \emph{sequential constraining
process}, we are able to simultaneously generate states with the heuristic
process and accurately estimate their probabilities, even when they are far too
small to be realistically inferred by direct counting. After showing that both
theoretically correct importance sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo are
possible using the sequential constraining process, we integrate it into a
methodology called \emph{state space sampling}, extending the ideas of state
space search from computer science to the sampling context. The methodology
comprises a dynamic data structure that constructs a robust Bayesian model of
the statistics generated by the heuristic process subject to an accuracy
constraint, the posterior Kullback-Leibler divergence. Sampling from the
dynamic structure will generally yield partial states, which are completed by
recursively calling the heuristic to refine the structure and resuming the
sampling. Our experiments on various Ising models suggest that state space
sampling enables heuristic state generation with accurate probability
estimates, demonstrated by illustrating the convergence of a simulated
annealing process to the Boltzmann distribution with increasing run length.
Consequently, heretofore unprecedented direct importance sampling using the
\emph{final} (marginal) distribution of a generic stochastic process is
allowed, potentially augmenting the range of algorithms at the Monte Carlo
practitioner's disposal.

damping force is proportional to velocity while it tends to saturate for larger

increases, which is interpreted in terms of Cooper-pair breaking.
Interestingly, this critical velocity is significantly lower than reported with

By enforcing symmetry weakly, the resulting method has additional flexibility
beyond previous MPSA methods. This allows for a construction of a method which
is applicable to all grid types, and in particular the method amends a crucial
shortcoming in previous MPSA methods for simplex grids.
  By formulating the method as a discrete variational problem, we prove
convergence of the new method for a wide range of problems, with conditions
that can be verified at the time of discretization. We present the first set of
comprehensive numerical tests for the MPSA methods in three dimensions,
covering Cartesian and simplex grids, with both heterogeneous and nearly
incompressible media. The tests show that the new method consistently is second
order convergent in displacement, despite being lowest order, with a rate that
mostly is between 1 and 2 for stresses. The results further show that the new
method is more robust and computationally cheaper than previous MPSA methods.

This involves estimating the pose of a sub-tree followed by identifying the

different parts. The mixtures of the sub-trees are learnt utilising both
geometric and appearance distances. The Chow-Liu (CL) algorithm is recursively
applied to determine the inter-relations between the nodes and to build the

parameters of the sub-trees and the inference is done using a standard belief
propagation technique. The proposed method handles occlusions during the
inference process by identifying overlapping regions between different

performed on three different datasets: the Leeds Sports, Image Parse and UIUC

kicked by the dipole field of a corrector magnet by describing the kinematics
of coherent undulator radiation after the kick. We demonstrated that the effect
of aberration of light supplies the basis for understanding phenomena like the
deflection of coherent undulator radiation by a dipole magnet. We illustrated
this fact by examining the operation of an XFEL under the steady state
assumption, that is a harmonic time dependence. We argued that in this
particular case the microbunch front tilt has no objective meaning; in other
words, there is no experiment that can discriminate whether an electron beam is
endowed with a microbunch front tilt of not. In this paper we extend our
considerations to time-dependent phenomena related with a finite electron bunch
duration, or SASE mode of operation. We focus our attention on the
spatiotemporal distortions of an X-ray pulse. Spatiotemporal coupling arises
naturally in coherent undulator radiation behind the kick, because the
deflection process involves the introduction of a tilt of the bunch profile.
This tilt of the bunch profile leads to radiation pulse front tilt, which is
equivalent to angular dispersion of the output radiation. We remark that our
exact results can potentially be useful to developers of new generation XFEL
codes for cross-checking their results.

presents a social challenge as well as an important research area. Accessible
geographic maps are helpful for acquiring knowledge about a city's or
neighborhood's configuration, as well as selecting a route to reach a
destination. Traditionally, raised-line paper maps with braille text have been
used. These maps have proved to be efficient for the acquisition of spatial
knowledge by visually impaired people. Yet, these maps possess significant
limitations. For instance, due to the specificities of the tactile sense only a
limited amount of information can be displayed on a single map, which
dramatically increases the number of maps that are needed. For the same reason,
it is difficult to represent specific information such as distances. Finally,
braille labels are used for textual descriptions but only a small percentage of
the visually impaired population reads braille. In France 15% of blind people
are braille readers and only 10% can read and write. In the United States,
fewer than 10% of the legally blind people are braille readers and only 10% of
blind children actually learn braille. Recent technological advances have
enabled the design of interactive maps with the aim to overcome these
limitations. Indeed, interactive maps have the potential to provide a broad
spectrum of the population with spatial knowledge, irrespective of age,
impairment, skill level, or other factors. To this regard, they might be an
efficient means for providing visually impaired people with access to

instantaneous luminosity and the spectral peak energy within a burst. This
correlation, which is known as the hardness-intensity correlation or the
Golenetskii correlation, not only holds important clues to the physics of GRBs
but is thought to have the potential to determine redshifts of bursts. In this
paper, I use a hierarchical Bayesian model to study the universality of the
rest-frame Golenetskii correlation and in particular I assess its use as a
redshift estimator for GRBs. I find that, using a power-law prescription of the
correlation, the power-law indices cluster near a common value, but have a
broader variance than previously reported ($\sim 1-2$). Furthermore, I find
evidence that there is spread in intrinsic rest-frame correlation
normalizations for the GRBs in our sample ($\sim 10^{51}-10^{53}$ erg
s$^{-1}$). This points towards variable physical settings of the emission
(magnetic field strength, number of emitting electrons, photospheric radius,
viewing angle, etc.). Subsequently, these results eliminate the Golenetskii
correlation as a useful tool for redshift determination and hence a
cosmological probe. Nevertheless, the Bayesian method introduced in this paper
allows for a better determination of the rest frame properties of the
correlation, which in turn allows for more stringent limitations for physical
models of the emission to be set.

of the oscillator strength. Finally, we demonstrate coherent control of the
exciton excited state population via pulsed resonant excitation and observe a
damping of the Rabi oscillations with increasing pulse area, which is
consistent with our exciton-photon coupling model. We believe that our work

study the problem of weighted string matching with a special focus on

importance of these results lies on the fact that these algorithms work in

Asada, Phys. Rev. D
{\bf 80}, 064021 (2009)], the gravitational radiation reaction to Lagrange's
equilateral triangular solution of the three-body problem is investigated in an
analytic method. The previous work is based on the energy balance argument,
which is sufficient for a two-body system because the number of degrees of
freedom (the semimajor axis and the eccentricity in quasi-Keplerian cases, for
instance) equals that of the constants of motion such as the total energy and
the orbital angular momentum. In a system with three (or more) bodies, however,
the number of degrees of freedom is more than that of the constants of motion.
Therefore, the present paper discusses the evolution of the triangular system
by directly treating the gravitational radiation reaction force to each body.
The perturbed equations of motion are solved by using the Laplace transform
technique. It is found that the triangular configuration is adiabatically
shrinking and is kept in equilibrium by increasing the orbital frequency due to
the radiation reaction if the mass ratios satisfy the Newtonian stability
condition. Long-term stability involving the first post-Newtonian corrections
is also discussed.

proposed on a regular basis. Understanding the advantages and limitations of
different network inference methods is key to their effective application in
different circumstances. The common structural properties shared by diverse
networks naturally pose a challenge when it comes to devising accurate
inference methods, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of comparison and
evaluation methods. Historically, every new methodology has only been tested
against \textit{gold standard} (true values) purpose-designed synthetic and
real-world (validated) biological networks. In this paper we aim to assess the
impact of taking into consideration aspects of topological and information
content in the evaluation of the final accuracy of an inference procedure.
Specifically, we will compare the best inference methods, in both
graph-theoretic and information-theoretic terms, for preserving topological
properties and the original information content of synthetic and biological
networks. New methods for performance comparison are introduced by borrowing
ideas from gene set enrichment analysis and by applying concepts from
algorithmic complexity. Experimental results show that no individual algorithm
outperforms all others in all cases, and that the challenging and non-trivial
nature of network inference is evident in the struggle of some of the
algorithms to turn in a performance that is superior to random guesswork.
Therefore special care should be taken to suit the method to the purpose at
hand. Finally, we show that evaluations from data generated using different
underlying topologies have different signatures that can be used to better
choose a network reconstruction method.

give an overview of the modeling, which includes the heliosphere as an example
of a special astrosphere. Then we concentrate on the shock structures of fluid
models, especially of hydrodynamic (HD) models. More involved models taking
into account radiation transfer and magnetic fields are briefly sketched. Even
the relatively simple HD models show a rich shock structure, which might be
observable in some objects. We employ a single fluid model to study these
complex shock structures, and compare the results obtained including heating
and cooling with results obtained without these effects. Furthermore, we show
that in the hypersonic case valuable information of the shock structure can be
obtained from the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. We solved the Euler equations for
the single fluid case and also for a case including cooling and heating. We
also discuss the analytical Rankine-Hugoniot relations and their relevance to
observations. We show that the only obtainable length scale is the termination
shock distance. Moreover, the so-called thin shell approximation is usually not
valid. We present the shock structure in the model that includes heating and
cooling, which differs remarkably from that of a single fluid scenario in the
region of the shocked interstellar medium. We find that the heating and cooling
is mainly important in this region and is negligible in the regions dominated
by the stellar wind beyond an inner boundary.

some ideas from Watanabe's work (2015). In particular, we leverage the

of various type covering lemmas; and (ii) the uniform continuity of the
conditional rate-distortion function in both the source (joint) distribution
and the distortion level. To obtain the error exponent, for the achievability
part, we use the same generalized type covering lemma and for the converse, we
use the strong converse together with a change-of-measure technique. Finally,
to obtain the moderate deviations constant, we apply the moderate deviations
theorem to probabilities defined in terms of information spectrum quantities.

the unique property of supporting nonradiating modes independently of the

Moreover, the possibility of switching between radiating and nonradiating modes

opto- and acousto-mechanical systems.

achieving robust computation. Here, we propose a method for introducing
independent random single-qubit gates into the logical circuit in such a way
that the effective logical circuit remains unchanged. We prove that this
randomization tailors the noise into stochastic Pauli errors, leading to
dramatic reductions in worst-case and cumulative error rates, while introducing
little or no experimental overhead. Moreover we prove that our technique is
robust to variation in the errors over the gate sets and numerically illustrate
the dramatic reductions in worst-case error that are achievable. Given such
tailored noise, gates with significantly lower fidelity are sufficient to
achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, and, importantly, the worst case
error rate of the tailored noise can be directly and efficiently measured
through randomized benchmarking experiments. Remarkably, our method enables the
realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation under the error rates

microscopy an ideal tool. However, dopant dynamics involve processes occurring
at nanosecond timescales, posing a significant challenge to experiment. Here we
use time-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy to probe and
study transport through a dangling bond on silicon before the system relaxes or
adjusts to accommodate an applied electric field. Atomically resolved,
electronic pump-probe scanning tunnelling microscopy permits unprecedented,
quantitative measurement of time-resolved single dopant ionization dynamics.
Tunnelling through the surface dangling bond makes measurement of a signal that
would otherwise be too weak to detect feasible. Distinct ionization and
neutralization rates of a single dopant are measured and the physical process
controlling those are identified.

magnetic fields generated by a mA range current in an IC structure over a field
of 50 x 200 {\mu}m^2 with sub-micron resolution. Vector measurements allow
using a more robust algorithm than those used for MCI using Giant Magneto
Resistance (GMR) or Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors
and it is opening new current reconstruction prospects. Calculated MCI from
these measurements shows a very good agreement with theoretical current path.
Acquisition time is around 10 sec, which is much faster than scanning
measurements using SQUID or GMR. The experimental set-up relies on a standard
optical microscope, and the measurements can be performed at room temperature
and atmospheric pressure. These early experiments, not optimized for IC, show
that NV centers in diamond could become a real alternative for MCI in IC.

there is exactly one vertex $x$ that lies simultaneously on a shortest
$(u,v)$-path, a shortest $(v,w)$-path and a shortest $(w,u)$-path. Examples of
median graphs are trees and hypercubes.
  We introduce and study a generalisation of tree decompositions, to be called
median decompositions, where instead of decomposing a graph $G$ in a treelike
fashion, we use general median graphs as the underlying graph of the
decomposition. We show that the corresponding width parameter $\text{mw}(G)$,
the medianwidth of $G$, is equal to the clique number of the graph, while a
suitable variation of it is equal to the chromatic number of $G$.
  We study in detail the $i$-medianwidth $\text{mw}_i(G)$ of a graph, for which
we restrict the underlying median graph of a decomposition to be isometrically
embeddable to the Cartesian product of $i$ trees. For $i\geq 1$, the parameters
$\text{mw}_i$ constitute a hierarchy starting from treewidth and converging to
the clique number. We characterize the $i$-medianwidth of a graph to be,
roughly said, the largest ""intersection"" of the best choice of $i$ many tree
decompositions of the graph.
  Lastly, we extend the concept of tree and median decompositions and propose a
general framework of how to decompose a graph $G$ in any fixed graphlike
fashion.

in one particular type of shearing box model -- unstratified with no net

resistivity) the saturation amplitude decreases with increasing numerical
resolution. We show that this result is strongly dependent on the vertical
aspect ratio of the computational domain $L_z/L_x$. When $L_z/L_x\lesssim 1$,
we recover previous results. However, when the vertical domain is extended
$L_z/L_x \gtrsim 2.5$, we find the saturation level of the stress is greatly
increased (giving a ratio of stress to pressure $\alpha \gtrsim 0.1$), and
moreover the results are independent of numerical resolution. Consistent with
previous results, we find that saturation of the MRI in this regime is
controlled by a cyclic dynamo which generates patches of strong toroidal field
that switches sign on scales of $L_x$ in the vertical direction. We speculate
that when $L_z/L_x\lesssim 1$, the dynamo is inhibited by the small size of the
vertical domain, leading to the puzzling dependence of saturation amplitude on
resolution. We show that previous toy models developed to explain the MRI
dynamo are consistent with our results, and that the cyclic pattern of toroidal
fields observed in stratified shearing box simulations (leading to the
so-called butterfly diagram) may also be related. In tall boxes the saturation
amplitude is insensitive to whether or not explicit dissipation is included in
the calculations, at least for large magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl number.
Finally, we show MRI turbulence in tall domains has a smaller critical
$\rm{Pm}_c$, and an extended lifetime compared to $L_z/L_x\lesssim 1$ boxes.

very strong Lyman-$\alpha$ and HeII 1640\AA\ line luminosities, but no metal
line emission. Previous studies suggest that CR7 hosts either young primordial
stars with a total stellar mass of $\sim 10^7\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ or a black
hole of $\gtrsim 10^6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Here, we explore different formation
scenarios for CR7 with a semianalytical model, based on the random sampling of
dark matter merger trees. We are unable to reproduce the observational
constraints with a primordial stellar source, given our model assumptions, due
to the short stellar lifetimes and the early metal enrichment. Black holes that
are the remnants of the first stars are either not massive enough, or reside in
metal-polluted haloes, ruling out this possible explanation of CR7. Our models
instead suggest that direct collapse black holes, which form in metal-free
haloes exposed to large Lyman-Werner fluxes, are more likely the origin of CR7.
However, this result is derived under optimistic assumptions and future
observations are necessary to further constrain the nature of CR7.

vectors. Although high-dimensional control is a largely unsolved problem, there
has recently been progress for modest dimensionalities. Here we report on a
successful attempt at addressing problems of dimensionality as high as $2000$,
of a particular form. Motivated by important applications such as
recommendation systems that do not fit the standard reinforcement learning
frameworks, we introduce Slate Markov Decision Processes (slate-MDPs). A
Slate-MDP is an MDP with a combinatorial action space consisting of slates
(tuples) of primitive actions of which one is executed in an underlying MDP.
The agent does not control the choice of this executed action and the action
might not even be from the slate, e.g., for recommendation systems for which
all recommendations can be ignored. We use deep Q-learning based on feature
representations of both the state and action to learn the value of whole
slates. Unlike existing methods, we optimize for both the combinatorial and
sequential aspects of our tasks. The new agent's superiority over agents that
either ignore the combinatorial or sequential long-term value aspect is
demonstrated on a range of environments with dynamics from a real-world
recommendation system. Further, we use deep deterministic policy gradients to
learn a policy that for each position of the slate, guides attention towards
the part of the action space in which the value is the highest and we only
evaluate actions in this area. The attention is used within a sequentially
greedy procedure leveraging submodularity. Finally, we show how introducing
risk-seeking can dramatically improve the agents performance and ability to
discover more far reaching strategies.

  Behaviors and Correlating Downtimes. ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,
  Vol.17, No. 4, Article No. 39, 2017","10.1145/3093893",,"cs.NI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The seek for the best quality of service has led Cloud infrastructure clients
to disseminate their services, contents and data over multiple cloud
data-centers often involving several Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). The
consequence of this is that a large amount of bytes must be transmitted across
the public Cloud. However, very little is known about its bandwidth dynamics.
To address this, we have conducted a measurement campaign for bandwidth between
eighteen data-centers of four major CSPs. Such extensive campaign allowed us to
characterize the resulting time series of bandwidth as the addition of a
stationary component and some infrequent excursions (typically, downtimes).
While the former provides a description of the bandwidth users can expect in
the Cloud, the latter is closely related to the robustness of the Cloud (i.e.,
the occurrence of downtimes is correlated). Both components have been studied
further by applying a factor analysis, specifically ANOVA, as a mechanism to
formally compare data-centers' behaviors and extract generalities. The results
show that the stationary process is closely related to data-center locations
and CSPs involved in transfers, which fortunately makes both the Cloud more
predictable and the set of reported measurements extrapolate. On the other
hand, although the correlation in the Cloud is low, i.e., only 10% of the
measured pair of paths showed some correlation, we have found evidence that
such correlation depends on the particular relationships between pairs of
data-centers with little link to more general factors. Positively, this implies
that data-centers either at the same area or CSP do not show qualitatively more
correlation than others data-centers, which eases the deployment of robust
infrastructures. On the downside, this metric is barely generalizable and,
consequently, calls for exhaustive monitoring.

error-correcting codes suitable for high bit-rate optical-fiber communication
systems. A spatially-coupled split-component ensemble is defined, generalizing
from the most important codes of this class, staircase codes and braided block
codes, and preserving a deterministic partitioning of component-code bits over
code blocks. Our analysis focuses on low-complexity iterative algebraic
decoding, which, for the binary erasure channel, is equivalent to a
generalization of the peeling decoder. Using the differential equation method,
we derive a vector recursion that tracks the expected residual graph evolution
throughout the decoding process. The threshold of the recursion is found using
potential function analysis. We generalize the analysis to mixture ensembles
consisting of more than one type of component code, which provide increased
flexibility of ensemble parameters and can improve performance. The analysis
extends to the binary symmetric channel by assuming mis-correction-free
component-code decoding. Simple upper-bounds on the number of errors
correctable by the ensemble are derived. Finally, we analyze the threshold of
spatially-coupled split-component ensembles under beyond bounded-distance
component decoding.

  The ML Family workshop aims to recognize the entire extended family of ML and
ML-like languages: languages that are Higher-order, Typed, Inferred, and
Strict. It provides the forum to discuss common issues, both practical
(compilation techniques, implementations of concurrency and parallelism,
programming for the Web) and theoretical (fancy types, module systems,
metaprogramming). The scope of the workshop includes all aspects of the design,
semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching of the members of
the ML family.
  The OCaml workshop is more specifically targeted at the OCaml community, with
an emphasis on new proposals and tools aiming to improve OCaml, its
environment, and the functioning of the community. As such, it is interested in
works on the type system, language extensions, compiler and optimizations,
applications, tools, and experience reports of exciting uses.

recently obtained wormhole solution of the EiBI theory, which generalizes the
zero mass Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole of general relativity. The solutions of EiBI
theory contain an extra parameter $\kappa$ having the inverse dimension of the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and is expected to modify various general
relativistic observables such as the masses of wormhole mouths, tidal forces
and light deflection. A remarkable result is that a non-zero $\kappa$ could
prevent the tidal forces in the geodesic orthonormal frame from becoming
arbitrarily large near a small throat radius $(r_0 \sim {0})$ contrary to what
happens near a small Schwarzschild horizon radius $(M \sim 0)$. The role of
$\kappa$ in the flare-out and energy conditions is also analysed, which reveals
that the energy conditions are violated. We show that the exotic matter in the
EiBI wormhole cannot be interpreted as phantom $({\omega}=(p_{r}/ \rho)<-1)$ or
ghost field ${\phi} $ of general relativity due to the fact that both $\rho$
and $p_{r}$ are negative for all $\kappa$.

that $\cal M^p_\omega$ contains functions of order 1. Moreover, we prove that
the orthogonal projection from $L^p(\cal R,d\omega)$ into $\cal M^p_\omega$ is

of PM10 in urban environments. SWBI is a daily measure available at province
level. BES data, currently available only for 2013 and 2014, are annual and
available at regional level. Flu data are weekly and distributed as regional
data and PM10 are collected daily for different cities. Due to the fact that
the time scale and space granularity of the different indexes varies, we apply
a novel statistical technique to discover nowcasting features and the classical
latent analysis to study the relationships among them. A preliminary analysis
suggest that the environmental and health conditions anticipate several
dimensions of the perception of well-being as measured by SWBI. Moreover, the
set of indicators included in the BES represent a latent dimension of
well-being which shares similarities with the latent dimension represented by
SWBI.
