violate the additivity property of Kolmogorov probabilities, and they are
interpreted as Dempster-Shafer probabilities. Deviations from the additivity
property are quantified with the Mobius (or non-additivity) operators which are
defined through Mobius transforms, and which are shown to be intimately related
to commutators. The lack of distributivity in the Birkhoff-von Neumann lattice
Lambda , causes deviations from the law of the total probability (which is
central in Kolmogorov's probability theory). Projectors which quantify the lack
of distributivity in Lambda , and also deviations from the law of the total
probability, are introduced. All these operators, are observables and they can
be measured experimentally. Constraints for the Mobius operators, which are
based on the properties of the Birkhoff-von Neumann lattice (which in the case
of finite quantum systems is a modular lattice), are derived.Application of
this formalism in the context of coherent states, generalizes coherence to

dependence for multivariate or spatially-indexed stochastic processes and time
series. Most of these proceed by first transforming data to some specific
extreme value marginal distribution, often the unit Fr\'echet, then fitting a
family of max-stable processes to the transformed data and exploring dependence
within the framework of that model. The marginal transformation, model
selection, and model fitting are all possible sources of misspecification in
this approach.
  We propose an alternative model-free approach, based on the idea that
substantial information on the strength of tail dependence and its temporal
structure are encoded in the distribution of the waiting times between
exceedances of high thresholds at different locations. We propose quantifying
the strength of extremal dependence and assessing uncertainty by using
statistics based on these waiting times. The method does not rely on any
specific underlying model for the process, nor on asymptotic distribution
theory. The method is illustrated by applications to climatological, financial,
and electrophysiology data.
  To put the proposed approach within the context of the existing literature,
we construct a class of spacetime-indexed stochastic processes whose waiting
time distributions are available in closed form by endowing the support points
in de Haan's spectral representation of max-stable processes with random birth
times, velocities, and lifetimes, and applying Smith's model to these
processes. We show that waiting times in this model are stochatically
decreasing in mean speed, and the sample mean of the waiting times obeys a
central limit theorem with a uniform convergence rate under mild conditions.
This indicates that our procedure can be implemented in this setting using
standard $t$ statistics and associated hypothesis tests.

the other, termed internal activity, that is regulated internally in an

control of stimulus response, and controls stimulus information. A cycle of
neural dynamics is then introduced to model information processing by the
neurons during which the stimulus information is dynamically enhanced by the
internal gain-modulation mechanism. Based on the conservation law for entropy
production, we demonstrate that the cycle generates entropy ascribed to the
stimulus-related activity using entropy supplied by the internal mechanism,
analogously to a heat engine that produces work from heat. We provide an
efficient cycle that achieves the highest entropic efficiency to retain the

which reproduces asymptotic forms of $T_c$ derived in several lattices, such as
the square, honeycomb, and Lieb lattices, for the weakly interacting limit. The
derived asymptotic forms of $T_c$ are categorized into four types, which is
attributed to the different responses of the degenerate fermions depending on
the DOS structures. The DOS with a delta-functional singularity induces the
highest $T_c$ in the weakly interacting region, where $T_c$ is linearly
proportional to the pairing interaction $U$. Three kinds of universal ratios
defined in the BCS theory no longer reduce to constants independent of the
system parameters but can be parameterized with a certain variable that
characterizes the singular structures of the DOS. We find universal
relationship among thermodynamic quantities that holds for all parameter
regions. Further, we numerically demonstrate that in multi-band systems the
correlation effects can induce an effective delta-functional singularity. This

fundamental problem. Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered
the adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from
birth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among
genetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic
component in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder
principle, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically
expressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division
time is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a
fixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean
cell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in
timing increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the
distribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is
independent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in
experimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to
different newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides
further insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions
of the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective
means become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various
modifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder
principle. In summary, our simple yet elegant model explains key experimental
findings and suggests a mechanism for regulating both the mean and fluctuations

cosmic acceleration. We demonstrate this method on the largest type Ia
supernova (SN) data set available to date, as compiled by the Joint Light-curve
Analysis (JLA) collaboration and, hence, consider the cosmological parameters
that affect the luminosity distance. We divide the supernova sample into equal
surface area pixels and estimate the cosmological parameters that minimize the
chi-square of the fit to the distance modulus in each pixel, hence producing
maps of the cosmological parameters $\{\Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}, H_{0}\}.$
In poorly sampled pixels, the measured fluctuations are mostly due to an
inhomogeneous coverage of the sky by the SN surveys; in contrast, in
well-sampled pixels, the measurements are robust enough to suggest a real
fluctuation. We also measure the anisotropy of the parameters by computing the
power spectrum of the corresponding maps of the parameters up to $\ell=3.$ For
an analytical toy model of an inhomogeneous ensemble of homogeneous pixels, we
derive the backreaction term in the deceleration parameter due to the
fluctuations of $H_{0}$ across the sky and measure it to be of order $10^{-3}$
times the corresponding average over the pixels in the absence of backreaction.
We conclude that, for the toy model considered, backreaction is not a viable
dynamical mechanism to emulate cosmic acceleration.

rate and pool sizes scale to infinity simultaneously, in proportion to a
scaling parameter $n$, while the number of routers remains fixed.
  We define and study a multi-router generalization of the pull-based customer
assignment (routing) algorithm PULL, introduced in [11] for the single-router

""pull-message"" to a randomly uniformly selected router; each router operates
independently -- it assigns an arriving customer to a server according to a
randomly uniformly chosen available (at this router) pull-message, if there is
any, or to a randomly uniformly selected server in the entire system,
otherwise.
  Under Markov assumptions (Poisson arrival process and independent
exponentially distributed service requirements), and under sub-critical system
load, we prove asymptotic optimality of PULL: as $n\to\infty$, the steady-state
probability of an arriving customer experiencing blocking or waiting, vanishes.
Furthermore, PULL has an extremely low router-server message exchange rate of
one message per customer. These results generalize some of the single-router
results in [11].

learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The
results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is
different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly
detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one
graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated
building system validate the proposed approach.

The new criteria are only known to be sufficient for blow-up. Therefore, to

investigate analogous criteria for blow-up of the 1D Burgers equation, where
blow-up is well-known to occur.

proposed superlattice, and the effect of structural disorder on the relation is
discussed. In inhomogeneous substrate with equal widths, zero-energy states
emerge in the form of Dirac points by using asymmetric potentials, and the
positions of Dirac points are addressed analytically. Further, the Dirac point
exists at $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$ only for specific potentials; every time it
appears, the group velocity vanishes in $k_y$ direction and the resonance
occurs. For general cases that inhomogeneous substrate with unequal widths, a

from a physical standpoint the appearance of many spectral sequences relating
various link homology theories to one another. We also study structural
properties of colored HOMFLY homology for links and evaluate Poincare
polynomials in numerous examples. Among these structural properties is a novel
""sliding"" property, which can be explained by using (refined) modular S-matrix.
This leads to the identification of modular transformations in Chern-Simons

dimensions (and, correspondingly, mass dimension two fermions in six

spinor has many applications, from particle physics to cosmology. On the other
hand, six-dimensional brane-world models have, among other prominent features,
the spontaneous confinement of free spin 1 fields and a mechanism that explains
the mass hierarchy of fundamental fermions. In this paper, we use scalar
couplings in order to confine the zero mode of Elko in six dimensions.
Moreover, we use the Elko dark spinor features to propose an exotic coupling in
order to remove the complex-valued terms in the massive Kaluza-Klein modes.
Hence, we show that six dimensional models can resolve the main issues of Elko
fields confinement presented in five dimensions.

the invariant mass of $750~{\rm GeV}$ with a local significance of $3.6\sigma$

as the on-shell production of a real singlet scalar in the $pp \to S \to \gamma
\gamma$ channel. To accommodate the observed production rate, we further
introduce a vector-like fermion $F$, which is carrying both color and electric
charges. The viable regions of model parameters are explored for this simple
extension of the Standard Model (SM). Moreover, we revisit the problem of
electroweak vacuum stability in the same scenario, and find that the
requirement for the electroweak vacuum stability up to high energy scales
imposes serious constraints on the Yukawa coupling of the vector-like fermion
and the quartic couplings of the SM Higgs boson and the new singlet scalar.
Consequently, a successful explanation for the diphoton excess and the absolute
stability of electroweak vacuum cannot be achieved simultaneously in this
economical setup.

(super Earths) have low observed mean densities which can only be explained by
voluminous gaseous atmospheres. Here, we study the conditions allowing the
accretion and retention of such atmospheres. We self-consistently couple the
nebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas
envelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we
address mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We
find that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass)
following the disk's dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their
atmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the
underlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles
than the core (equivalently, lighter than a few % of the planet's mass) can be
blown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool
and contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale
to the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the
mass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets
have to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres,
while not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion
and become gas giants (Jupiters). We compare our results to the observed
super-Earth population and find that low-density planets are indeed
concentrated in the theoretically allowed region. Our analytical and intuitive
model can be used to investigate possible super-Earth formation scenarios.

prospects for this detection technique. While in the companion paper we focus
on axions and WIMPs, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the
measurement of the DBD of $^{136}$Xe in a high pressure Xe (HPXe) TPC.
Particularly relevant are the results obtained in Xe + TMA mixtures with
microbulk Micromegas, showing very promising results in terms of gain,
stability of operation, and energy resolution at pressures up to 10 bar. TMA at
levels of $\sim$1\% reduces electron diffusion by a factor of 10 with respect
to pure Xe, improving the quality of the topological pattern, with a positive
impact on the discrimination capability. Operation with a medium size prototype
(30 cm diameter and 38 cm drift) of 1 kg of Xe at 10 bar in the fiducial
volumen has allowed to test the detection concept in realistic experimental
conditions. Microbulk Micromegas are able to image the DBD ionization signature
with high quality while, at the same time, measuring its energy deposition with
a resolution of at least $\sim$3% FWHM @ Q$_{\beta\beta}$, and probably down to
$\sim$1% FWHM. In addition, first results on the topological signature
information show promising background discrimination capabilities out of reach
of other experimental implementations. Moreover, microbulk Micromegas have very
low levels of intrinsic radioactivity, and offer cost-effective scaling-up
options. All these results demonstrate that Micromegas-read HPXe TPC is a very
competitive technique for the next generation DBD experiments.

We discuss the Wigner classifications of unitary irreducible
Poincar\'e-modules, write down covariant field equations for totally symmetric
massive and massless representations in flat space, and consider their
Lagrangian formulation. After an elementary exposition of the AdS unitary
representations, we review the key no-go and yes-go results concerning
higher-spin interactions, e.g., the Velo-Zwanziger acausality and its
string-theoretic resolution among others. The unfolded formalism, which
underlies Vasiliev's equations, is then introduced to reformulate the
flat-space Bargmann-Wigner equations and the AdS massive-scalar Klein-Gordon
equation, and to state the ""central on-mass-shell theorem"". These techniques
are used for deriving the unfolded form of the boundary-to-bulk propagator in
$AdS_4$, which in turn discloses the asymptotic symmetries of (supersymmetric)
higher-spin theories. The implications for string-higher-spin dualities
revealed by this analysis are then elaborated.

spatially separated for their subsequent manipulation in quantum circuits.
Separation that is both deterministic and universal can in principle be
achieved through anti-coalescent two-photon quantum interference. However, such
interference-facilitated pair separation (IFPS) has not been extensively
studied in the integrated setting, where the strong polarization and wavelength
dependencies of integrated couplers -- as opposed to bulk-optics beamsplitters
-- can have important implications for performance beyond the identical-photon
regime. This paper provides a detailed review of IFPS and examines how these
dependencies impact separation fidelity and interference visibility. Focus is
given to IFPS mediated by an integrated directional coupler. The analysis
applies equally to both on-chip and in-fiber implementations, and can be
expanded to other coupler architectures such as multimode interferometers. When
coupler dispersion is present, the separation performance can depend on photon
bandwidth, spectral entanglement, and the linearity of the dispersion. Under
appropriate conditions, reduction in the separation fidelity due to loss of
non-classical interference can be perfectly compensated for by classical
wavelength demultiplexing effects. This work informs the design as well as the
performance assessment of circuits for achieving universal photon pair
separation for states with tunable arbitrary properties.

security often called continuous monitoring and risk scoring (CMRS). We focus
on two most salient aspects of CMRS. First, continuous collection of data
through automated feeds; hence the term continuous monitoring. Typical data
collected for continuous monitoring purposes include network traffic
information as well as host information from host-based agents. Second,
analysis of the collected data in order to assess the risks - the risk scoring.
This assessment may include flagging especially egregious vulnerabilities and
exposures, or computing metrics that provide an overall characterization of the
network's risk level. Currently used risk metrics are often simple sums or
counts of vulnerabilities and missing patches.
  The research challenges pertaining to CMRS fall mainly into two categories.
The first centers on the problem of integrating and fusing highly heterogeneous
information. The second group of challenges is the lack of rigorous approaches
to computing risk. Existing risk scoring algorithms remain limited to ad hoc
heuristics such as simple sums of vulnerability scores or counts of things like
missing patches or open ports, etc. Weaknesses and potentially misleading
nature of such metrics are well recognized. For example, the individual
vulnerability scores are dangerously reliant on subjective, human, qualitative
input, potentially inaccurate and expensive to obtain. Further, the total
number of vulnerabilities may matters far less than how vulnerabilities are
distributed over hosts, or over time. Similarly, neither topology of the
network nor the roles and dynamics of inter-host interactions are considered by
simple sums of vulnerabilities or missing patches.

the screening and diagnosis of frequently occurring cancers. However image
quality may suffer by long acquisition times for MRIs due to patient motion, as
well as result in great patient discomfort. Reducing MRI acquisition time can
reduce patient discomfort and as a result reduces motion artifacts from the
acquisition process. Compressive sensing strategies, when applied to MRI, have
been demonstrated to be effective at decreasing acquisition times significantly
by sparsely sampling the \emph{k}-space during the acquisition process.
However, such a strategy requires advanced reconstruction algorithms to produce
high quality and reliable images from compressive sensing MRI. This paper
proposes a new reconstruction approach based on cross-domain stochastically
fully connected conditional random fields (CD-SFCRF) for compressive sensing
MRI. The CD-SFCRF introduces constraints in both \emph{k}-space and spatial
domains within a stochastically fully connected graphical model to produce
improved MRI reconstruction. Experimental results using T2-weighted (T2w)

performance in preserving fine details and tissue structures in the

statistical phylogenetics. Examples of such measurements include geographic
coordinates in the context of phylogeography and phenotypic traits in the
context of comparative studies. A popular approach is to model the evolution of
continuously varying traits as a Brownian diffusion process. However, standard
Brownian diffusion is quite restrictive and may not accurately characterize
certain trait evolutionary processes. Here, we relax one of the major
restrictions of standard Brownian diffusion by incorporating a nontrivial
estimable drift into the process. We introduce a relaxed drift diffusion model
for the evolution of multivariate continuously varying traits along a
phylogenetic tree via Brownian diffusion with drift. Notably, the relaxed drift
model accommodates branch-specific variation of drift rates while preserving
model identifiability. We implement the relaxed drift model in a Bayesian
inference framework to simultaneously reconstruct the evolutionary histories of
molecular sequence data and associated multivariate continuous trait data, and
provide tools to visualize evolutionary reconstructions. We illustrate our
approach in three viral examples. In the first two, we examine the
spatiotemporal spread of HIV-1 in central Africa and West Nile virus in North
America and show that a relaxed drift approach uncovers a clearer, more
detailed picture of the dynamics of viral dispersal than standard Brownian
diffusion. Finally, we study antigenic evolution in the context of HIV-1
resistance to three broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our analysis reveals
evidence of a continuous drift at the HIV-1 population level towards enhanced
resistance to neutralization by the VRC01 monoclonal antibody over the course

  Executions",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Android applications (apps) grow dramatically in recent years. Apps are user
interface (UI) centric typically. Rapid UI responsiveness is key consideration
to app developers. However, we still lack a handy tool for profiling app
performance so as to diagnose performance problems. This paper presents
PersisDroid, a tool specifically designed for this task. The key notion of
PersisDroid is that the UI-triggered asynchronous executions also contribute to
the UI performance, and hence its performance should be properly captured to
facilitate performance diagnosis. However, Android allows tremendous ways to
start the asynchronous executions, posing a great challenge to profiling such
execution. This paper finds that they can be grouped into six categories. As a
result, they can be tracked and profiled according to the specifics of each
category with a dynamic instrumentation approach carefully tailored for
Android. PersisDroid can then properly profile the asynchronous executions in
task granularity, which equips it with low-overhead and high compatibility
merits. Most importantly, the profiling data can greatly help the developers in
detecting and locating performance anomalies. We code and open-source release
PersisDroid. The tool is applied in diagnosing 20 open-source apps, and we find
11 of them contain potential performance problems, which shows its
effectiveness in performance diagnosis for Android apps.

short, the system phase space is unphysically enlarged in conventional

""renormalized"" variational approach to drift kinetic theory that manifestly
respects the parent model's initial value problem. The basic philosophy
underlying this alternate approach is that high-order drift kinetic theory
ought to be derived by truncating the all-orders system phase space Lagrangian
instead of the usual ""field+particle"" Lagrangian. For the sake of clarity, this
story is told first through the lens of a finite-dimensional toy model of
high-order variational drift kinetics, the analogous full-on drift kinetic

from standard equipartition arguments or from magnetically arrested disc (MAD)
simulations. We show that standard thin accretion discs can reach spin-disc
alignment out to large radii long before LT would play a role, as caused by the
slow infall time that gives even a weak BZ jet time to align the disc. We show
that geometrically thick radiatively inefficient discs and super-Eddington

density profiles are shallow as in magnetohydrodynamical simulations, while the
BZ jet aligns discs with steep density profiles (as in advection-dominated
accretion flows) with the BH spin out to larger radii. Our results imply that
the BZ jet torque should affect the cosmological evolution of BH spin magnitude

controversial results, possibly due to the unknown role of gas accumulation at
the interfaces. Here, during advanced atomic force microscopy of the initial
evolution of gas-containing structures at a highly ordered pyrolytic
graphite/water interface, a fluid phase first appeared as a circular wetting
layer ~0.3 nm in thickness and was later transformed into a cap-shaped
nanostructure (an interfacial nanobubble). Two-dimensional ordered domains were
nucleated and grew over time outside or at the perimeter of the fluid regions,
eventually confining growth of the fluid regions to the vertical direction. We
determined that interfacial nanobubbles and fluid layers have very similar
mechanical properties, suggesting low interfacial tension with water and a
liquid-like nature, explaining their high stability and their roles in boundary
slip and bubble nucleation. These ordered domains may be the interfacial
hydrophilic gas hydrates and/or the long-sought chemical surface
heterogeneities responsible for contact line pinning and contact angle
hysteresis. The gradual nucleation and growth of hydrophilic ordered domains
renders the original homogeneous hydrophobic/water interface more heterogeneous
over time, which would have great consequence for interfacial properties that
affect diverse phenomena, including interactions in water, chemical reactions,
and the self-assembly and function of biological molecules.

microwave signal is electro-optically modulated onto the pump lightwave that is
launched into one end of the fiber. Acoustic wave in the fiber inherits the
amplitude and phase information of the pump lightwave and thus the coupling
between the acoustic wave and pump lightwave leads to the auto-correlated
process of the pump lightwave as well as the modulated microwave signal.
Derivation of the SBS coupling equations shows that the short-pulse probe
lightwave amplified by the pump lightwave possesses the nature of
auto-correlation formula. All-optical pulse compression of the broadband

pulse with and without SBS. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out. The

sensitive data is steadily gaining importance. Conventional encryption methods
may not be sufficient to guarantee data protection in the future. Quantum key
distribution (QKD) is an emerging technology that exploits fundamental physical
properties to guarantee perfect security in theory. However, it is not easy to
ensure in practice that the implementations of QKD systems are exactly in line
with the theoretical specifications. Such theory-practice deviations can open
loopholes and compromise the security. Several of such loopholes have been
discovered and investigated in the last decade. These activities have motivated
the proposal and implementation of appropriate countermeasures, thereby
preventing future attacks and enhancing the practical security of QKD. This
article introduces the so-called field of quantum hacking by summarizing a
variety of attacks and their prevention mechanisms.

We found that the anomalous out-of-plane magnetization response exhibits an
escalating slope with increase in the nominal film thickness from 0.6 to 1.1
nm, however, it decreases with further increase in the film thickness, and then
practically vanishes on approaching the FeNi film percolation threshold. At the
same time, the in-plane response demonstrates saturation behavior above 1.5-2
T, competing with anomalously large diamagnetic-like response, which becomes
pronounced at high magnetic fields. It is possible that the supported-metal
interaction leads to the creation of a thin charge-transfer (CT) layer and a
Schottky barrier at the FeNi film/Sitall (TiO2) interface. Then, in the system
with nanoscale circular domains, the observed anomalous paramagnetic-like

a silicon band-edge emission and a broad composite band which was centered at

sheet by 2.5-dimensional MHD numerical simulations. Numerical results show that
many Petschek-like fine structures with slow-mode shocks mediated by plasmoid
instabilities develop during the magnetic reconnection process. The termination
shocks can also be formed above the primary magnetic island and at the head of
secondary islands. These shocks play important roles in generating thermal
energy in a corona current sheet. For a numerical simulation with initial
conditions close to the solar corona environment, the ratio of the generated
thermal energy to the total dissipated magnetic energy is around $1/5$ before
secondary islands appear. After secondary islands appear, the generated thermal
energy starts to increase sharply and this ratio can reach a value about $3/5$.
In an environment with a relatively lower plasma density and plasma $\beta$,
the plasma can be heated to a much higher temperature. After secondary islands
appear, the one dimensional energy spectra along the current sheet do not
behave as a simple power law and the spectrum index increases with the wave
number. The average spectrum index for the magnetic energy spectrum along the
current sheet is about $1.8$. The two dimensional spectra intuitively show that
part of the high energy is cascaded to large $kx$ and $ky$ space after
secondary islands appear. The plasmoid distribution function calculated from
numerical simulations behaves as a power law closer to $f(\psi) \sim \psi^{-1}$
in the intermediate $\psi$ regime. By using $\eta_{eff} = v_{inflow}\cdot L$,
the effective magnetic diffusivity is estimated about
$10^{11}\sim10^{12}$~m$^2$\,s$^{-1}$.

emergence and disappearance, evolution, splitting, and merging. The power of
the proposed framework is demonstrated on two medical literature corpora
concerned with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the metabolic syndrome
(MetS) -- both increasingly important research subjects with significant social
and healthcare consequences. In addition to the collected ASD and metabolic
syndrome literature corpora which we made freely available, our contribution
also includes an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed framework. We
describe a detailed and careful examination of the effects that our
algorithms's free parameters have on its output, and discuss the significance
of the findings both in the context of the practical application of our
algorithm as well as in the context of the existing body of work on temporal
topic analysis. Our quantitative analysis is followed by several qualitative
case studies highly relevant to the current research on ASD and MetS, on which
our algorithm is shown to capture well the actual developments in these fields.

gain a better understanding of how to combine dependent types with effects. We
define a dependently typed extension of CBPV, dCBPV-, and show that it has a
very natural small-step operational semantics, which satisfies subject
reduction and (depending on the effects present) determinism and strong
normalization, and an elegant categorical semantics, which - surprisingly - is
no more complicated than the simply typed semantics.
  We have full and faithful translations from a dependently typed version of
Moggi's monadic metalanguage and of a call-by-name (CBN) dependent type theory
into dCBPV- which give rise to the expected operational behaviour. However, it
turns out that dCBPV- does not suffice to encode call-by-value (CBV) dependent
type theory or the strong (dependent) elimination rules for positive
connectives in CBN-dependent type theory.
  To mend this problem, we discuss a second, more expressive system dCBPV+,
which additionally has a principle of Kleisli extension for dependent
functions. We obtain the desired CBV- and CBN-translations of dependent type
theory into dCBPV+. It too has a natural categorical semantics and operational
semantics. However, depending on the effects we consider, we may lose
uniqueness of typing, as the type of a computation may become more specified as
certain effects are executed. This idea can be neatly formalized using a notion
of subtyping.
  We hope that the theoretical framework of this paper on the one hand provides
at least a partial answer to the fundamental type theoretic question of how one
can understand the relationship between computational effects and dependent
types. On the other hand, we hope it can contribute a small-step towards the
ultimate goal of an elegant fully fledged language for certified effectful
programming.

conveniently constructed from two ingredients: an energy functional and a
Poisson bracket. The goal of this paper is to elucidate how the Poisson
brackets can be constructed and what additional features we also gain by the
construction. In particular, the Poisson brackets governing reversible
evolution in one-particle kinetic theory, kinetic theory of binary mixtures,
binary fluid mixtures, classical irreversible thermodynamics and classical
hydrodynamics are derived from Liouville equation. Although the construction is
quite natural, a few examples where it does not work are included (e.g. the
BBGKY hierarchy). Finally, a new infinite grand-canonical hierarchy of Poisson
brackets is proposed, which leads to Poisson brackets expressing non-local
phenomena such as turbulent motion or evolution of polymeric fluids.
Eventually, Lie-Poisson structures standing behind some of the brackets are
identified.

100\% longitudinally polarized and left-handed. It is also confirmed by
neutrino oscillation experiments that neutrinos have tiny but non-zero masses.
Since their masses are non-zero the neutrinos cannot be strictly described by
pure helicity states which coincide with the chirality eigenstates. On the
other hand, it is generally assumed that ultrarelativistic massive fermions can
be described well enough by the Weyl equations. This assumption obviously
explains why the neutrinos are almost 100\% longitudinally polarized. We
discuss the validity of this assumption and show that the assumption is
fallacious for a fermion with a general spin orientation. For instance, a
fermion with a transverse polarization (relative to its momentum) cannot be
described by one of the Weyl equations even in the ultrarelativistic limit.
Hence, the fact that neutrinos are almost completely longitudinally polarized
cannot be explained in the basis of relativistic quantum mechanics or quantum
field theory. As a solution to this problem, we propose a new hypothesis
according to which neutrinos are strictly described by pure helicity states
although they are not massless.

convergence of these operators in a weighted space of functions on a positive
semi-axis and estimate the approximation by using a new type of weighted
modulus of continuity introduced by Gadjiev and Aral in [12]. An algorithm is
also given to plot graphical examples, and we have shown the convergence of
these operators towards the function and these examples can be take as a
comparison between the new operators with the previous one too. Finally, some
numerical examples are also given.

  Monitor Mode","Project website: https://seemoo.tu-darmstadt.de/nexmon",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Full control over a Wi-Fi chip for research purposes is often limited by its
firmware, which makes it hard to evolve communication protocols and test
schemes in practical environments. Monitor mode, which allows eavesdropping on
all frames on a wireless communication channel, is a first step to lower this
barrier. Use cases include, but are not limited to, network packet analyses,
security research and testing of new medium access control layer protocols.
Monitor mode is generally offered by SoftMAC drivers that implement the media
access control sublayer management entity (MLME) in the driver rather than in
the Wi-Fi chip. On smartphones, however, mostly FullMAC chips are used to
reduce power consumption, as MLME tasks do not need to wake up the main
processor. Even though, monitor mode is also possible in FullMAC scenarios, it
is generally not implemented in today's Wi-Fi firmwares used in smartphones.
This work focuses on bringing monitor mode to Nexus 5 smartphones to enhance
the interoperability between applications that require monitor mode and BCM4339
Wi-Fi chips. The implementation is based on our new C-based programming
framework to extend existing Wi-Fi firmwares.
