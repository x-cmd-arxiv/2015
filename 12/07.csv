astrophysical plasma. To describe a thin plasma layer with a free surface in a
vertical external magnetic field we use the shallow water ap- proximation. The
presence of a vertical magnetic field essentially changed the wave processes
dynamics in astrophysical plasma compared to the neu- tral uid and plasma layer
in a thoroidal magnetic field. In present case thre are three-waves nonlinear
interactions. Using the asymptotic mul- tiscale we deduced nonlinear wave
packets interaction equations: three magneto-Poincare waves interaction, three
magnetostrophic waves inter- action, the interaction of two magneto-Poincare
and one magnetostrophic wave and two magnetostrophic and one magneto-Poincare
wave interac- tion. The existence of decay instabilities and parametric
amplifications is predicted. We found following four types of decay
instabilities: magneto- Poincare wave decays into two magneto-Poincare waves,
magnetostrophic wave decays into two magnetostrophic waves, magneto-Poincare
wave de- cays into one magneto-Poincare wave and one magnetostrophic wave,
magnetostrophic wave decays into one magnetostrophic wave and one
magneto-Poincare wave. Also following mechanisms of parametric amplifications
were found: parametric amplification of magneto-Poincare waves, parametric
amplification of magnetostrophic waves, magneto-Poincare wave amplification in
magnetostrophic wave presence nd magnetostrophic wave amplification in
magneto-Poincare wave presence. The instabilities growth rates and parametrical
amplifications factors were found respectively.

relationship between a novel risk measure, the Expected Downside Risk (EDR) and
the expected return. On the one hand, our proposed risk measure uses a
nonparametric approach that allows us to get rid of any assumption on the
distribution of returns. On the other hand, our asset pricing model is based on
loss-averse investors of Prospect Theory, through which we implement the
risk-seeking behaviour of investors in a dynamic setting. By including EDR in
our proposed model unrealistic assumptions of commonly used equilibrium models
- such as the exclusion of risk-seeking or price-maker investors and the
assumption of unlimited leverage opportunity for a unique interest rate - can
be omitted. Therefore, we argue that based on more realistic assumptions our
model is able to describe equilibrium expected returns with higher accuracy,
which we support by empirical evidence as well.

have shown that speaker characteristics are captured by spectral feature as

the spectral feature as it directly represents the timbre characteristics,
while some conversion methods have focused only on the prosodic feature
represented by the fundamental frequency. In this paper, a comprehensive
framework using deep neural networks to convert both timbre and prosodic
features is proposed. The timbre feature is represented by a high-resolution
spectral feature. The prosodic features include F0, intensity and duration. It
is well known that DNN is useful as a tool to model high-dimensional features.
In this work, we show that DNN initialized by our proposed autoencoder
pretraining yields good quality DNN conversion models. This pretraining is
tailor-made for voice conversion and leverages on autoencoder to capture the
generic spectral shape of source speech. Additionally, our framework uses
segmental DNN models to capture the evolution of the prosodic features over
time. To reconstruct the converted speech, the spectral feature produced by the
DNN model is combined with the three prosodic features produced by the DNN
segmental models. Our experimental results show that the application of both
prosodic and high-resolution spectral features leads to quality converted
speech as measured by objective evaluation and subjective listening tests.

reconstruction conditions for a sparse signal are met and the reconstruction is
achieved, the noise due to missing samples does not influence the results in a
direct way. It influences the possibility to recover a signal only. Additive
input noise will remain in the resulting reconstructed signal. The accuracy of
the recovery results is related to the additive input noise. Simple derivation
of this relation is presented. If a reconstruction algorithm for a sparse

to missing samples will remain and behave as an additive input noise. An exact

early universe. After inflation ends, the bubbles quickly dissipate their
kinetic energy; they come to rest with respect to the Hubble flow and
eventually form black holes. The fate of the bubble itself depends on the
resulting black hole mass. If the mass is smaller than a certain critical
value, the bubble collapses to a singularity. Otherwise, the bubble interior
inflates, forming a baby universe, which is connected to the exterior FRW
region by a wormhole. A similar black hole formation mechanism operates for
spherical domain walls nucleating during inflation. As an illustrative example,
we studied the black hole mass spectrum in the domain wall scenario, assuming
that domain walls interact with matter only gravitationally. Our results
indicate that, depending on the model parameters, black holes produced in this
scenario can have significant astrophysical effects and can even serve as dark
matter or as seeds for supermassive black holes. The mechanism of black hole
formation described in this paper is very generic and has important
implications for the global structure of the universe. Baby universes inside
super-critical black holes inflate eternally and nucleate bubbles of all vacua
allowed by the underlying particle physics. The resulting multiverse has a very
non-trivial spacetime structure, with a multitude of eternally inflating
regions connected by wormholes. If a black hole population with the predicted

along with known integrals of motion allow to reduce the initial problem to the
system of the sixth order. Assuming, that the metric of the curved space has a
random component, we derive the system of \emph{stochastic differential

taking into account the influence of random forces of various origin and in
particular the quantum fluctuations. Using SDEs of motion, we obtain the
partial differential equation of the second order describing the probability
distribution of the point mass in the momentum representation. It is shown,
that the equation for the probability distribution is solved jointly with the
classical equations, which in turn are responsible for the topological
peculiarities of tubes of quantum currents and transitions between asymptotic
channels. The latter allows to solve the problem of the limiting transition
from the quantum region to the region of classical chaotic motion (Poincar\'e

objects compared to an earlier test by Eracleous et al. (1997) and we use much
longer time series for the three objects studied in that paper. Although
systematic changes in radial velocity can be traced in many of their lines,
they are demonstrably not like those of a spectroscopic binary in a circular
orbit. Any spectroscopic binary period must therefore be much longer than the
span of the monitoring (assuming a circular orbit), which in turn would require
black hole masses that exceed by 1-2 orders of magnitude the values obtained
for these objects using techniques such as reverberation mapping and stellar
velocity dispersion. Moreover, the response of the double-peaked Balmer line
profiles to fluctuations of the ionizing continuum and the shape of the
Ly-alpha profiles are incompatible with a SMBH binary. The binary broad-line
region hypothesis is therefore disfavored. Other processes evidently shape
these line profiles and cause the long-term velocity variations of the double
peaks.

systems composed of two components, one of which is highly lossy and the other
is lossless. The losses are accounted by a Rayleigh dissipative function. As we
have shown previously, for such a composite system the modes split into two
distinct classes, high-loss and low-loss, according to their dissipative
behavior. A principal result of this paper is that for any such system a rather
universal phenomenon of selective overdamping occurs. Namely, first of all the
high-loss modes are all overdamped, i.e., non-oscillatory, as are an equal
number of low-loss modes. Second of all, the rest of the low-loss modes remain
oscillatory (i.e., the underdamped modes) each with an extremely high quality
factor (Q-factor) that actually increases as the loss of the lossy component
increases. We prove that selective overdamping is a generic phenomenon in
Lagrangian systems with gyroscopic forces and give an analysis of the
overdamping phenomena in such systems. Moreover, using perturbation theory, we
derive explicit formulas for upper bound estimates on the amount of loss
required in the lossy component of the composite system for the selective
overdamping to occur in the generic case, and give Q-factor estimates for the
underdamped modes. Central to the analysis is the introduction of the notion of
a ""dual"" Lagrangian system and this yields significant improvements on some
results on modal dichotomy and overdamping. The effectiveness of the theory
developed here is demonstrated by applying it to an electric circuit with a
gyrator element and a high-loss resistor.

from a standard blackbody accretion disc, testing whether its inner radius can
be set equal to that of the reflector. However, this leads to an unphysical
behaviour of the disc truncation radius, implying the soft X-ray component is
not a standard blackbody disc. This appears to be due to irradiation by the
hard X-rays, which strongly dominate the total emission. We consider a large
array of models, testing, e.g., the effects of the chosen energy range, of
adding unblurred reflection, and assuming a lamppost geometry. We find the
effects of relativistic broadening to be relatively weak in all cases. In the
coronal models, we find the inner radius to be large. In the lamppost model,
the inner radius is unconstrained, but when fixed to the innermost stable
orbit, the height of the source is large, which also implies a weak
relativistic broadening. In the former models, the inner radius correlates with
the X-ray hardness ratio, which is consistent with the presence of a truncated
disc turning into a complete disc in the soft state. We also find the degree of
the disc ionization to anti-correlate with the hardness, leading to strong
spectral broadening due to scattering of reflected photons in the reflector in
the softest studied states.

appears to be robust with respect to changes in the diffuse galactic background
modeling. The three main proposals for the GCE are an unresolved population of
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), outbursts of cosmic rays from the GC region, and
self-annihilating dark matter (DM). The injection of secondary electrons and
positrons into the interstellar medium (ISM) by an unresolved population of
MSPs or DM annihilations can lead to observable gamma-ray emission via inverse
Compton scattering or bremsstrahlung. Here we investigate how to determine
whether secondaries are important in a model for the GCE. We develop a method
of testing model fit which accounts for the different spatial morphologies of
the secondary emission. We examine several models which give secondary emission
and illustrate a case where a broadband analysis is not sufficient to determine
the need for secondary emission.

different parametric models that could also explain the temporal changes in

luminous radio sources with a compact double morphology, commonly thought to
represent the earliest stages in the life cycle of powerful radio galaxies

with much lower radio luminosity - particularly in the nearby Universe. These
less powerful objects, with typical 1.4 GHz radio luminosities of $10^{23}$ to
$10^{25}$ W/Hz, include peaked-spectrum radio sources with a core-jet
morphology on parsec scales as well as high-frequency GPS-like peaked

case, the presence of a young GPS component may not be evident from
low-frequency data alone. Many radio galaxies in the local Universe have a
compact (FR-0) morphology, and appear to lack extended radio emission on
kiloparsec scales. The relationship of these FR-0 objects to the classical
GPS/CSS radio sources remains unclear - some of them may represent short-lived
episodes of AGN activity that will not lead to an extended FR-1 or FR-2 radio
galaxy. Future wide-band radio surveys will shed more light on this - such
surveys should ideally be coordinated to cover the full frequency range from
100 MHz to 100 GHz in order to sample all stages of GPS/CSS evolution in an

not made by gravitational lensing magnification bias but AGNs. These AGNs allow
us to derive the AGN UV LF at $z \sim 2$ down to the faint magnitude limit of

the evolution of stellar population nor outflow alone, but the evolution of
neutral hydrogen HI density in inter-stellar medium that enhances dust

mechanistic understanding of stochastic processes. These are particularly
challenging and necessary when exploring processes that exhibit long-range
correlations. The most common signatures employed rely on second-order temporal
statistics and lead, for example, to identifying long memory in processes with
power-law autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$.
However, most stochastic processes hide their memory in higher-order temporal
correlations. Information measures---specifically, divergences in the mutual
information between a process' past and future (excess entropy) and minimal
predictive memory stored in a process' causal states (statistical
complexity)---provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with
higher-order temporal correlations. However, there are no ergodic stationary
processes with infinite excess entropy for which information measures have been
compared to autocorrelation functions and Hurst exponents. Here, we show that
fractal renewal processes---those with interevent distribution tails $\propto
t^{-\alpha}$---exhibit long memory via a phase transition at $\alpha = 1$.
Excess entropy diverges only there and statistical complexity diverges there
and for all $\alpha < 1$. When these processes do have power-law
autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$, they do not
have divergent excess entropy. This analysis breaks the intuitive association
between these different quantifications of memory. We hope that the methods
used here, based on causal states, provide some guide as to how to construct

crucial to correctly interpret astronomical photometric measurements like type
Ia supernovae observations. On the other hand, the expansion rate at different
epochs, i.e. the observational Hubble parameter data $H(z)$, are obtained from
differential ageing of passively evolving galaxies or from baryon acoustic
oscillations and thus are not affected by cosmic opacity. In this work, we
first construct opacity-free luminosity distances from $H(z)$ determinations,
taking correlations between different redshifts into consideration for our

time-dependent pulses are imposed at the bottom to simulate the jets. The
simulation results show that without other energy source, the injected plasmas
are accelerated effectively to be a transonic wind with a substantial mass
flux. The rapid acceleration occurs close to the Sun, and the resulting
asymptotic speed, number density at 0.3 AU, as well as mass flux normalized to
1 AU are compatible with in situ observations. As a result of the high speed,
the imposed pulses generate a train of shocks traveling upward. By tracing the
motions of the injected plasma, it is found that these shocks heat and
accelerate the injected plasmas successively step by step to push them upward
and eventually allow them to escape. The parametric studies show that
increasing the speed of the imposed pulses or their temperature gives a
considerably faster, and hotter solar wind, while increasing their number
density or decreasing their recurring period only bring a denser solar wind.
These studies provide a possibility that the ubiquitous high-speed jets are a

force analysis shows that the fast hot jet is continually driven by the Lorentz
force around the reconnection region, while the slow cool jet is induced by an
initial kick through the Lorentz force associated with the emerging magnetic
flux. Also, the features of the driven jets change with the amount of the
emerging magnetic flux, giving the varieties of both jets. These results will
inspire our understanding of the formation of the prevalence of both the fast

during hard states of black hole binaries. Several studies have established
various observational/empirical correlations between spectral parameters and
QPO properties, indicating a close link between the two. However, the exact
mechanism of generation of QPO is not yet well understood. In this paper, we
present our attempts to comprehend the connection between the spectral
components and the low frequency QPO observed in GRS 1915+105 using the data
from NuSTAR. Detailed spectral modeling as well as the presence of the low
frequency QPO and its energy dependence during this observation have been
reported by Miller et al. (2013) and Zhang et al. (2015) respectively. We
investigate the compatibility of the spectral model and energy dependence of
the QPO by simulating light curves in various energy bands for small variation
of the spectral parameters. The basic concept here is to establish connection,
if any, between the QPO and the variation of either a spectral component or a
specific parameter, which in turn can shed some light on the origin of the QPO.
We begin with the best fit spectral model of Miller et al. (2013) and simulate
the light curve by varying the spectral parameter at frequencies close to the
observed QPO frequency in order to generate the simulated QPO. Further we
simulate similar light curves in various energy bands in order to reproduce the
observed energy dependence of RMS amplitude of the QPO. We find that the
observed trend of increasing RMS amplitude with energy can be reproduced
qualitatively if the spectral index is assumed to be varying with the phases of
the QPO. Variation of any other spectral parameter does not reproduce the
observed energy dependence.

algorithms compute $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations of DTW and ED in time
near-linear for point sequences drawn from k-packed or k-bounded curves, and
subquadratic for backbone sequences. Roughly speaking, a curve is
$\kappa$-packed if the length of its intersection with any ball of radius $r$

between two curve points does not go too far from the two points compared to
the distance between the two points. In backbone sequences, consecutive points
are spaced at approximately equal distances apart, and no two points lie very
close together. Recent results suggest that a subquadratic algorithm for DTW or

(ii) to identify a sufficient set of driver variables for the purpose of
probabilistic structural controllability of a generic CBN. We also elaborate on

reconfiguring the time and/or location of each node's presence in the network,
these models induce alternative sets of colocation events giving rise to

causal reasoning about how correlations in nodes' spatiotemporal preferences
not only lead to a given contact network but ultimately influence the network's
spreading potential. We find the correlation between nodes and times to be the
greatest impediment to spreading, while the correlation between times and

resonance (FMR) is very important in interpreting dc-voltage in electrical
detection of FMR. Based on the causality principle and the assumption that the
usual microwave absorption lineshape around FMR is Lorentzian, general forms of
dynamic susceptibility of an arbitrary sample and the corresponding dc-voltage
lineshape are obtained. Our main findings are: 1) The dynamic susceptibility is
not a Polder tensor for material with arbitrary anisotropy. Two off-diagonal
elements are not in general opposite to each other. However, the linear
response coefficient of magnetization to total rf field is a Polder tensor.
This may explain why two off-diagonal elements are always assumed to be
opposite to each other in analyses. 2) The frequency dependence of dynamic
susceptibility near FMR is fully characterized by six numbers while its field
dependence is fully characterized by seven numbers. 3) A recipe of how to
determine these numbers by standard microwave absorption measurements for an
arbitrary sample is proposed. Our results allow one to unambiguously separate
the contribution of the anisotropic magnetoresistance to dc-voltage from that
of the anomalous Hall effect. With these results, one can reliably extract the
information of spin pumping and the inverse spin Hall effect, and determine the
spin-Hall angle. 4) The field-dependence of susceptibility matrix at a fixed
frequency may have several peaks when the effective field is not monotonic of
the applied field. In contrast, the frequency-dependence of susceptibility
matrix at a fixed field has only one peak. Furthermore, in the case that
resonance frequency is not sensitive to the applied field, the field dependence
of susceptibility matrix, as well as dc-voltage, may have another non-resonance
broad peak. Thus, one should be careful in interpreting observed peaks.

2-10 keV) emission from the central SMBH in type-I AGNs. A sample of 47 local
X-ray selected type-I AGNs at $z<0.2$ is extracted from the 2XMMi/SDSS DR7
catalog that is originally crossmatched by Pineau et al. The X-ray luminosities
in an energy band from 2 to 10keV of these luminous AGNs range from $10^{42}$
to $10^{44}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$. A joint spectral analysis is performed on
their optical and X-ray spectra, in which the [\ion{O}{3}] line profile is
modeled by a sum of several Gaussian functions to quantify its deviation from a
pure Gaussian function. The statistics allows us to identify a moderate
correlation with a significance level of 2.78$\sigma$: luminous AGNs with
stronger [\ion{O}{3}] blue asymmetry tend to have steeper hard X-ray spectra.
By identifying a role of $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ on the correlation at a
$2-3\sigma$ significance level in both direct and indirect ways, we argue that
the photon index versus asymmetry correlation provides evidence that the AGN's
outflow commonly observed in its NLR is related with the accretion process
occurring around the central SMBH, which favors the wind/radiation model for
the origin of the outflow in luminous AGNs.

study a simplified model with large matrix size up to $N=256$ by Monte Carlo

lattice distortion of the ZnO NWs. The lattice distortion can significantly
tune the electronic and optical properties, and requires a sensitive and
convenient measurement. However, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) technique provides a limited sensitivity of 0.01 nm on the
variation of the lattice spacing and requires vacuum conditions. Here we
demonstrate a highly-sensitive detection of the lattice distortion in single
bent ZnO NWs by second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. As the curvature
of the single bent ZnO NW increases to 21 mm-1 (<4% bending distortion), it
shows a significant decrease (~70%) in the SHG intensity ratio between
perpendicular and parallel excitation polarization with respect to c-axis of
ZnO NWs. Importantly, the extraordinary non-axisymmetrical SHG polarimetric
patterns are also observed, indicating the twisting distortion around c-axis of
ZnO NWs. Thus, SHG microscopy provides a sensitive all-optical and non-invasive
method for in situ detecting the lattice distortion under various

(f_5GHz < 3.9 uJy/beam). Given current constraints on the distance (2.3-6.3
kpc), its 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux corresponds to an Eddington ratio Lx/Ledd =
4e-9 -- 3e-8 (assuming a black hole mass of 10 Msun). The broadband spectrum is
dominated by synchrotron radiation from a relativistic population of outflowing
thermal electrons, which we argue to be a common signature of short-period
quiescent BHXBs. Furthermore, we identify the frequency where the synchrotron
radiation transitions from optically thick-to-thin (approximately 2-5e14 Hz,

interstellar absorption along the line of sight. High Galactic latitude systems

of the Chern-Simons term for the hypercharge gauge field, showing that the
left-handed and right-handed components of each fermion species contribute with
opposite sign. This is in contrast to the results presented in some of the
previous works. The $\textrm{U}_{\textrm{Y}}(1)$ Chern-Simons term affects the
resulting anomalous magnetohydrodynamic (AMHD) equations. We solve the
resulting coupled evolution equations for the lepton and baryon asymmetries, as
well as the hypermagnetic field to obtain their time evolution along with their
values at the electroweak phase transition ($T_{EW} \sim 100$GeV) for a variety
of critical ranges for their initial values at $T=10$TeV. We first investigate
the results of this sign change, by directly comparing our results with those
obtained in one of the previous works and find that matter asymmetry generation
increases considerably in the presence of a strong hypermagnetic field.
Furthermore, we find that a strong hypermagnetic field can generate matter
asymmetry starting from absolutely zero asymmetry, while matter asymmetry can
generate a hypermagnetic field provided the initial value of the latter is
nonzero.

clustered at the cell poles, are crucial to this sensitivity. Although it has
been suggested that the kinase CheA and the adapter protein CheW are integral
for receptor connectivity, the exact coupling mechanism remains unclear. Here,

mechanism itself, building on nanodisc and electron cryotomography experiments.
Specifically, we investigate how the sensing behavior of mixed receptor
clusters is affected by variations in the expression levels of CheA and CheW at
a constant receptor density in the membrane. Our model compares favorably with
dose-response curves from in vivo F\""orster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
measurements, demonstrating that the receptor-methylation level has only minor
effects on receptor cooperativity. Importantly, our model provides an
explanation for the non-intuitive conclusion that the receptor cooperativity
decreases with increasing levels of CheA, a core signaling protein associated
with the receptors, whereas the receptor cooperativity increases with
increasing levels of CheW, a key adapter protein. Finally, we propose an
evolutionary advantage as explanation for the recently suggested CheW-only

Under- standing of

introducing an artificial dynamical sys- tem. This opens up the possibility of
using a range of other filtering methods, such as 3DVAR and Kalman based

problems are studied in the sense that the observational noise is assumed to be
derived via realization of a Gaussian random variable. We investigate the
asymptotic behavior of filter based methods for these inverse problems.
Rigorous convergence rates are established for 3DVAR and for the Kalman
filters, including minimax rates in some instances. Blowup of 3DVAR and a
variant of its basic form is also presented, and optimality of the Kalman

in the quadrupole moment of the secondary star. The latter is commonly referred
to as the Applegate mechanism. Following Brinkworth et al. (2006), we employ
here an improved version of Applegate's model including the angular momentum
exchange between a finite shell and the core of the star. The framework is
employed to derive the general conditions under which the Applegate mechanism
can work, and is subsequently applied to a sample of 16 close binary systems
with potential planets, including 11 PCEBs. Further, we present a detailed
derivation and study of analytical models which allow for an straightforward
extension to other systems. Using our full numerical framework, we show that
the Applegate mechanism can clearly explain the observed eclipsing time
variations in 4 of the systems, while the required energy to produce the
quadrupole moment variations is too high in at least 8 systems. In the
remaining 4 systems, the required energy is comparable to the available energy
produced by the star, which we consider as borderline cases. Therefore, the
Applegate mechanism cannot uniquely explain the observed period time variations
for this entire population. Even in systems where the required energy is too
high, the Applegate mechanism may provide an additional scatter, which needs to
be considered in the derivation and analysis of planetary models.

for reorientation of the magnetization but thermal activation brings the system
over the barrier. A 2-dimensional representation of the energy surface is

namely, $$\mathsf{CC}^\mu_{0.49}(f) = O\left(\left(\mathsf{IC}_{1/8}(f) \cdot
\log \mathsf{IC}_{1/8}(f)\right)^2\right).$$ The latter bound was recently and
independently established by Kol [{\em Proc. 48th STOC}, 2016] using a
different technique.
  We show a similar result for query complexity under product distributions.
Let $g : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be a function. For every bit-wise
product distribution $\mu$ on $\{0,1\}^n$, we show that
$$\mathsf{QC}^\mu_{0.49}(g) = O\left(\left( \log \mathsf{qprt}_{1/8}(g) \cdot
\log \log\mathsf{qprt}_{1/8}(g) \right)^2 \right),$$ where
$\mathsf{QC}^\mu_{\varepsilon}(g)$ is the distributional query complexity of
$f$ with error at most $\varepsilon$ under the distribution $\mu$ and
$\mathsf{qprt}_{1/8}(g))$ is the {\em query partition bound} of the function
$g$.
  Partition bounds were introduced (in both communication complexity and query
complexity models) to provide LP-based lower bounds for randomized
communication complexity and randomized query complexity. Our results
demonstrate that these lower bounds are polynomially tight for {\em product}
distributions.

more and more important radiation technique widely used in clinical application
for cancer treatment. One of the key problems in VMAT is treatment plan
optimization, which is complicated due to the constraints imposed by the
involved equipments. In this paper, we consider a model with four major
constraints: the bound on the beam intensity, an upper bound on the rate of the
change of the beam intensity, the moving speed of leaves of the multi-leaf
collimator (MLC) and its directional-convexity. We solve the model by a
two-stage algorithm: performing minimization with respect to the shapes of the
aperture and the beam intensities alternatively. Specifically, the shapes of
the aperture are obtained by a greedy algorithm whose performance is enhanced
by random sampling in the leaf pairs with a decremental rate. The beam
intensity is optimized using a gradient projection method with non-monotonic
line search. We further improve the proposed algorithm by an incremental random
importance sampling of the voxels to reduce the computational cost of the
energy functional. Numerical simulations on two clinical cancer date sets
demonstrate that our method is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art
algorithms in terms of both computational time and quality of treatment
planning.

study both P. polycephalum and Lettuce seedlings were hybridised with gold
nanoparticles - functionalised and unfunctionalised - to explore their uptake,
toxicological effects and, crucially, any alterations in electrical properties
they bestow upon the organisms. Using various microscopy techniques it was
shown that P. polycephalum and lettuce seedlings are able to internalize
nanoparticles and assemble them in vivo, however some toxicological effects
were observed. The electrical resistance of both lettuce seedlings and P.
polycephalum was found to decrease, the most significant reduction being with
lettuce seedlings whose resistance reduced from 3MOhms to 0.5MOhms. We conclude
that gold is a suitable nanomaterial for biohybridisation specifically in

value, to identify the position of the chemical plume. However, due to noise
and sensors fault, the accurate identification of chemical pixels is not easy
even in this apparently simple situation. In this paper we present a
post-processing tool that, in a completely adaptive and data driven fashion,
allows to improve the performance of any classification methods in identifying
the boundaries of a plume. This is done using the Multidimensional Iterative

indistinguishable particles, based on the definition of entanglement of
particles given in [H. M. Wiseman et al., Phis. Rev. Lett 91, 097902 (2003)].
This discord of particles is then used to evaluate the quantum correlations in
a system of two identical bosons (fermions), where the particles perform a
quantum random walk described by the Hubbard hamiltonian in a 1D lattice. The
dynamics of the particles is either unperturbed or subject to a classical
environmental noise - such as random telegraph, pink or brown noise. The
observed results are consistent with those for the entanglement of particles,
and we observe that on-site interaction between particles have an important
protective effect on correlations against the decoherence of the system.

Standard Model (SM) Higgs, six additional Weyl spinor multiplets with $(I\pm
1/2, \pm(Y\pm 1/2))$ are needed in general. It has 13 parameters in total, five
mass parameters and eight Yukawa couplings. The DM sector of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is a special case of the model with
$(I,Y)=(1/2,1/2)$. Therefore, this model can be viewed as an extension of the
neutralino DM sector. We consider three typical cases: the neutralino-like, the
reduced and the extended cases. For each case, we survey the DM mass $m_\chi$
in the range of $(1,2500)$ GeV by random sampling from the model parameter
space and study the constraints from the observed DM relic density, the direct
search of LUX, XENON100 and PICO experiments, and the indirect search of

differences among these cases. It is found that the direct detection of
spin-independent DM scattering off nuclei and the indirect detection of DM
annihilation to $W^+W^-$ channel are more sensitive to the DM searches in the
near future. The allowed mass for finding $\tilde H$-, $\tilde B$-, $\tilde W$-

utilised: (1) simultaneous (same field) MOST satellite observations over four
weeks in each of the years 2012 and 2013, (2) multicolour observations at the
SAAO in April - May of 2013, (3) archival V-filter ASAS data for nine seasons,
2001 - 2009. They were augmented by an analysis of high-resolution,
public-domain VLT-UT2 UVES spectra from the years 2000 to 2012. From the MOST
observations, we infer that irregular light variations of RU Lup are caused by
stochastic variability of hot spots induced by unstable accretion. In contrast,
the MOST light curves of IM Lup are fairly regular and modulated with a period
of about 7.19 - 7.58 d, which is in accord with ASAS observations showing a
well defined 7.247+/-0.026 d periodicity. We propose that this is the
rotational period of IM Lup and is due to the changing visibility of two
antipodal hot spots created near the stellar magnetic poles during the stable
process of accretion. Re-analysis of RU Lup high-resolution spectra with the
Broadening Function approach reveals signs of a large polar cold spot, which is
fairly stable over 13 years. As the star rotates, the spot-induced depression
of intensity in the Broadening Function profiles changes cyclically with period
3.71058 d, which was previously found by the spectral cross-correlation method.

substantial work has been done in developing distributed binary SVM algorithms

distributed SVMs remains largely unexplored. This research proposes a novel
algorithm that implements the Support Vector Machine over a multi-class dataset
and is efficient in a distributed environment (here, Hadoop). The idea is to
divide the dataset into half recursively and thus compute the optimal Support
Vector Machine for this half during the training phase, much like a divide and
conquer approach. While testing, this structure has been effectively exploited
to significantly reduce the prediction time. Our algorithm has shown better
computation time during the prediction phase than the traditional sequential
SVM methods (One vs. One, One vs. Rest) and out-performs them as the size of
the dataset grows. This approach also classifies the data with higher accuracy
than the traditional multi-class algorithms.

mobile traffic demand. However, contrary to the current systems, energy
consumption of next generation networks is required to be load adaptive as the
network load varies significantly throughout the day. In this paper, we propose
a load adaptive multi-cell massive MIMO system where each base station (BS)
adapts the number of antennas to the daily load profile (DLP) in order to
maximize the downlink energy efficiency (EE). In order to incorporate the DLP,
the load at each BS is modeled as an M/G/m/m state dependent queue under the
assumption that the network is dimensioned to serve a maximum number of users
at the peak load. The EE maximization problem is formulated in a game theoretic
framework where the number of antennas to be used by a BS is determined through
best response iteration. This load adaptive system achieves around 24% higher
EE and saves around 40% energy compared to a baseline system where the BSs
always run with the fixed number of antennas that is most energy efficient at
the peak load and that can be switched off when there is no traffic.

Our morphological and structural analysis of an evolutionary sample of 335

shows that 45% of galaxies with young starbursts (tSB<0.1 Gyr) show signatures

find a good agreement between automated and visual classifications. The
majority of the oldest (post-)starburst galaxies in our sample (tSB~0.6Gyr)
have structural properties characteristic of early-type disks and are not as
highly concentrated as the fully quenched galaxies commonly found on the `red
sequence' in the present day Universe. This suggests that, if (post-)starburst
galaxies are a transition phase between active star-formation and quiescence,
they do not attain the structure of presently quenched galaxies within the
first 0.6 Gyr after the starburst.

to degeneracies in TTV inversion. For five planet pairs in our sample, strong

known, enabling useful constraints on planetary densities where we have robust

a wide range of densities is observed among sub-Neptune mass planets and that

conventionally considered static structure for contacts. Recently, an upsurge
of theoretical inquiry has strived towards rendering the models more realistic
by incorporating the temporal aspects of networks of contacts, societal and
online, that are of interest in the study of epidemics (and other similar
diffusion processes). However, temporal dynamics have predominantly focused on
link fluctuations and nodal activities, and less attention has been paid to the
growth of the underlying network. Many real networks grow: online networks are
evidently in constant growth, and societal networks can grow due to migration
flux and reproduction. The effect of network growth on the epidemic properties
of networks is hitherto unknown---mainly due to the predominant focus of the
network growth literature on the so-called steady-state. This paper takes a
step towards alleviating this gap. We analytically study the degree dynamics of
a given arbitrary network that is subject to growth. We use the theoretical
findings to predict the epidemic properties of the network as a function of
time. We observe that the introduction of new individuals into the network can
enhance or diminish its resilience against endemic outbreaks, and investigate
how this regime shift depends upon the connectivity of newcomers and on how
they establish connections to existing nodes. Throughout, theoretical findings
are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations over synthetic and real networks.
The results shed light on the effects of network growth on the future epidemic
properties of networks, and offers insights for devising a-priori immunization
strategies.

alignment of chromosomes between two spindle poles and attachment of their

diseases including cancer. While a multitude of biological factors regulating
chromosome congression and bi-orientation have been identified, it is still
unclear how they are integrated so that coherent chromosome motion emerges from
a large collection of random and deterministic processes. Here we address this
issue by a three dimensional computational model of motor-driven chromosome
congression and bi-orientation during mitosis. Our model reveals that
successful cell division requires control of the total number of microtubules:
if this number is too small bi-orientation fails, while if it is too large not
all the chromosomes are able to congress. The optimal number of microtubules
predicted by our model compares well with early observations in mammalian cell
spindles. Our results shed new light on the origin of several pathological

complementary visualization techniques. These visualizations are based on the

maximally stimulate a representation component, and caricaturization, in which
the visual patterns that a representation detects in an image are exaggerated.
We pose these as a regularized energy-minimization framework and demonstrate
its generality and effectiveness. In particular, we show that this method can
invert representations such as HOG more accurately than recent alternatives

events caused by topological bifurcations at radial nulls are rather rare and
short-lived. The so-called X-lines formed by the radial nulls in the Harris

not exhibit any energy dissipation. Energy dissipation is more powerful in the
vicinity of spiral nulls enclosed by magnetic flux ropes with strong currents

InAs quantum dot and a wetting layer, based on strong diamagnetic shifts of
many-body exciton states using magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy. An
extremely large positive diamagnetic coefficient is observed when an electron
in the wetting layer combines with a hole in the quantum dot; the coefficient
is nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of the exciton states
confined in the quantum dots. Recombination of electrons with holes in a
quantum dot of the coupled system leads to an unusual negative diamagnetic
effect, which is five times stronger than that in a pure quantum dot system.
This effect can be attributed to the expansion of the wavefunction of remaining
electrons in the wetting layer or the spread of electrons in the excited states
of the quantum dot to the wetting layer after recombination. In this case, the
wavefunction extent of the final states in the quantum dot plane is much larger
than that of the initial states because of the absence of holes in the quantum
dot to attract electrons. The properties of emitted photons that depend on the
large electron wavefunction extents in the wetting layer indicate that the
coupling occurs between systems of different dimensionality, which is also
verified from the results obtained by applying a magnetic field in different
configurations. This study paves a new way to observe hybrid states with zero-

the circular shaped shells show a strong bending instability and successive
fragmentation on Cartesian grids soon after their formation, while remain
almost unperturbed when simulated on polar meshes. We explain this by physical
Rayleigh--Taylor like instabilities triggered by corrugation of the dense shell
surfaces by numerical noise. Conditions for these instabilities follow from
both the shell structure itself and from episodes of transient acceleration
during re-establishing of dynamical pressure balance after sudden radiative
cooling onset. They are also easily excited by physical perturbations of the
ambient medium. The widely mentioned Non-linear Thin Shell Instability, in
contrast, in tests with physical perturbations is shown to have only limited
chances to develop in real radiative shocks, as it seems to require a special
spatial arrangement of fluctuations to be excited efficiently. The described
phenomena also set new requirements on further simulations of the radiatively
cooling shocks in order to be physically correct and free of numerical

investigated the nature of magnetic state in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ through studying
critical exponents, low temperature thermal demagnetization and magnetocaloric
effect. The estimated critical exponents do not exactly match with any
universality class, however, the values obey the scaling behavior. The exponent
values suggest that spin interaction in present material is close to mean-field
model. The analysis of low temperature thermal demagnetization data, however,
shows dual presence of localized- and itinerant-type of magnetic interaction.
Moreover, field dependent change in magnetic entropy indicates magnetic
interaction is close to mean-field type. While this material shows an
insulating behavior across the magnetic transition, yet a distinct change in
slope in resistivity is observed around $T_c$. We infer that though the

generally been characterized through short range density fluctuations described
through the atomic pair distribution functions (PDF). Recent numerical and
experimental results have suggested that such a description of order or
structure in liquid water is incomplete and there exists considerably longer
ranged orientational correlations in water that can be studied through dipolar
correlations. In this study, using large scale classical, atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations using TIP4P-Ew and TIP3P models of water, we show
that salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), caesium
chloride (CsCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl$_2$) have a long range effect on
the dipolar correlations, which can not be explained by the notion of structure
making and breaking by dissolved ions. The relative effects of cations on
dipolar correlations are observed to be consistent with the well-known
Hofmeister series. Observed effects are explained through orientational
stratification of water molecules around ions, and their long range coupling to
the global hydrogen bond network by virtue of the sum rule for water. The
observations for single hydrophilic solutes are contrasted with the same for a
single methane (CH$_4$) molecule. We observe that even a single small
hydrophobe can result in enhancement of long range orientational correlations
in liquid water,- contrary to the case of dissolved ions, which have been
observed to have a reducing effect. The observations from this study are
discussed in the context of hydrophobic effect.

periodic broadcast transmissions. As a consequence, both the clock offsets and
drifts need to be taken into account in addition to the vehicle motion to
accurately estimate the vehicle ranges. We develop a range estimation algorithm
using local polynomial smoothing of the vehicle motion. The proposed algorithm
can be applied to networks with arbitrary number of vehicles and requires no
additional message exchanges apart from the periodic broadcasts. We validate
our algorithm on experimental data and show that the performance of the
proposed approach is close to that obtained using unicast round-trip time
ranging. In particular, we are able to achieve sub-meter ranging accuracies in
vehicular scenarios. Our scheme requires additional timestamp information to be

compression algorithm to minimize the resulting overhead.

current Medium Access Control (MAC) in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs).
The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol for WLANs proposes up
to four Access Categories (AC) that can be mapped to different traffic
priorities. High priority ACs are allowed to transmit more often than low
priority ACs, providing a way of prioritising delay sensitive traffic like
voice calls or video streaming. Further, EDCA also considers the intricacies
related to the management of multiple queues, virtual collisions and traffic
differentiation. Nevertheless, EDCA falls short in efficiency when performing
in dense WLAN scenarios. Its collision-prone contention mechanism degrades the
overall throughput to the point of starving low priority ACs, and produce
priority inversions at high number of contenders. Carrier Sense Multiple Access
with Enhanced Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) is a compatible MAC protocol for
WLANs which is also capable of providing traffic differentiation. Contrary to
EDCA, CSMA/ECA uses a contention mechanism with a deterministic backoff
technique which is capable of constructing collision-free schedules for many
nodes with multiple active ACs, extending the network capacity without starving
low priority ACs, as experienced in EDCA. This work analyses traffic
differentiation with CSMA/ECA by describing the mechanisms used to construct
collision-free schedules with multiple queues. Additionally, evaluates the
performance under different traffic conditions and a growing number of
contenders. (arXiv's abstract field is not large enough for the paper's

method employed for tackling the accretion problem has masked some properties

transonic nor supersonic as the fluid approaches the horizon(s); rather, they
remain subsonic for all values of the radial coordinate. Moreover, the three
velocity vanishes and the pressure diverges on the horizon(s), resulting in a
flowout of the fluid under the effect of its own pressure. This is in favor of
an earlier prediction that pressure-dominant regions form near the horizon.
This result does not depend on the form of the metric and it applies to a
neighborhood of any horizon where the time coordinate is timelike. For anti-de
Sitter-like $\text{f}(R)$ black holes we discuss the stability of the critical
flow and determine separatrix heteroclinic orbits. For de Sitter-like
$\text{f}(R)$ black holes, we construct polytropic cyclic, non-homoclinic,
physical flows connecting the two horizons. These flows become non-relativistic
for Hamiltonian values higher than the critical value allowing for a good
estimate of the proper period of the flow.

$^{14}$Be $^{20}$C and $^{22}$C. The model describes the experimental data for
$^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be and to some extend $^{20}$C. The recoil momentum

for different two-neutron separation energies, and from the comparison with

range $100\lesssim S_{2n}\lesssim 400$ KeV. The recoil momentum distribution
depends weakly on the neutron-$^{20}$C scattering length, while the matter

closing of single-particle gap and change in topological invariants. However,
in the presence of electronic interactions, topological phase transitions are
more complicated. In paper I of this series (arXiv:1510.07816), we have
developed an efficient scheme to evaluate the topological invariants based on
Green's function formalism. Here, in paper II, we demonstrate four
interaction-drive topological phase transitions (TPTs) in two-dimensional (2D)
interacting topological insulators (TIs) via large-scale quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) simulations, based on the scheme of evaluating topological invariants
presented in paper I. Across these transitions, the defining symmetries of the
TIs have been neither explicitly nor spontaneously broken. In the first two
models, the topological invariants calculated from Green's function formalism
succeed in characterizing interaction-driven TPTs. However, in the second two
models, we find single-particle gap does not close and the topological
invariants constructed from single-particle Green's function acquire no change
across the TPTs. Unexpected breakdown of the Green's function formalism in
constructing topological invariants is thus discovered. We thence classify the
TPTs in interacting TIs into two categories: those have noninteracting
correspondence can be characterized successfully by the topological invariants
constructed from Green's functions, while for the others that do not have
noninteracting correspondence, the Green's function formalism experiences a
breakdown but more interesting and exciting phenomena, such as emergent
collective critical modes at the transition, arise. Discussion on the success
and breakdown of topological invariants constructed from the Green's function
formalism in the context of symmetry protected topological (SPT) states is
presented.

depends on the starting point. We exploit this starting-point dependence to

distinct components of the short-range Coulomb interactions: loop currents
result from the repulsion between nearest-neighbor copper and oxygen orbitals,
while charge order results from repulsion between neighboring oxygen orbitals.
We find that the leading piLC phase has an antiferromagnetic pattern similar to
previously discovered staggered flux phases, and that it emerges abruptly at
hole dopings p below the van Hove filling. Subsequent charge ordering
tendencies in the piLC phase reveal that diagonal d-charge density waves (dCDW)
are suppressed by the loop currents while axial order competes more weakly. In
some cases we find a wide temperature range below the loop-current transition,
over which the susceptibility towards an axial dCDW is large. In these cases,
short-range axial charge order may be induced by doping-related disorder. A
unique feature of the coexisting dCDW and piLC phases is the emergence of an
incommensurate modulation of the loop currents. If the dCDW is biaxial
(checkerboard) then the resulting incommensurate current pattern breaks all
mirror and time-reversal symmetries, thereby allowing for a polar Kerr effect.

the constraints in a series of brief reviews of the current status of the
considered channels. Finally, we present a few consequences of these flavour
constraints for the NMSSM, turning to two specific scenarios: one is
characteristic of the MSSM-limit and illustrates the workings of charged-Higgs
and genuinely supersymmetric contributions to flavour-changing processes; the
second focus is a region where a light CP-odd Higgs is present. Strong limits
are found whenever an enhancement factor - large $\tan\beta$, light $H^{\pm}$,
resonant pseudoscalar - comes into play.

including rotation, conservation of angular momentum (AM), and simulations of
disk-locking (DL). By assuming that DL is the regulation mechanism for the
stellar angular velocity during the early stages of pMS, we use our models and
observational data to constrain disk lifetimes (Tdisk) of a sample of low-mass
stars in the ONC and NGC2264. The period distributions of the ONC and NGC2264
are bimodal and depend on the stellar mass. To follow the rotational evolution
of these two clusters' stars, we generated some sets of evolutionary tracks. We
assumed that the evolution of fast rotators can be modeled by considering
conservation of AM during all stages and of moderate rotators by considering
conservation of angular velocity during the first stages of evolution. With
these models we estimate a mass and an age for all stars. For the ONC, we
assume that the secondary peak in the period distribution is due to high-mass
objects locked in their disks, with a locking period (Plock) of ~8 days. For
NGC2264 we make two hypotheses: (1) the stars in the secondary peak are locked
with Plock=5 days, and (2) NGC2264 is in a later stage in the rotational
evolution (this implies in a DL scenario with Plock=8 days, a Tdisk of 1 Myr
and, after that, constant AM evolution). We simulated the period distribution
of NGC2264 when its mean age was 1 Myr. Dichotomy and bimodality appear in the
simulated distribution, presenting one peak at 2 days and another one at 5-7
days, indicating that the assumption of Plock=8 days is plausible. Our
hypotheses are compared with observational disk diagnoses available in the
literature. DL models with Plock=8 days and 0.2 Myr<=Tdisk<=3 Myr are
consistent with observed periods of moderate rotators of the ONC. For NGC2264,
hyphotesis 2 is the more promising explanation for its period distribution.

  Parameter-Insensitive Clustering Method","28 pages, 14 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Most density-based clustering methods largely rely on how well the underlying
density is estimated. However, density estimation itself is also a challenging
problem, especially the determination of the kernel bandwidth. A large
bandwidth could lead to the over-smoothed density estimation in which the
number of density peaks could be less than the true clusters, while a small
bandwidth could lead to the under-smoothed density estimation in which spurious
density peaks, or called the ""ripple noise"", would be generated in the
estimated density. In this paper, we propose a density-based hierarchical
clustering method, called the Deep Nearest Neighbor Descent (D-NND), which
could learn the underlying density structure layer by layer and capture the
cluster structure at the same time. The over-smoothed density estimation could
be largely avoided and the negative effect of the under-estimated cases could
be also largely reduced. Overall, D-NND presents not only the strong capability
of discovering the underlying cluster structure but also the remarkable
reliability due to its insensitivity to parameters.

the concept of Schur rotations, originally proposed by Kramer, to the case of
aperiodic structures with icosahedral symmetry; these rotations induce a
rotation of the physical and orthogonal spaces invariant under the icosahedral
group, and hence, via the cut-and-project method, a continuous transformation
of the corresponding model sets. We prove that this approach allows for a
characterisation of such transitions in a purely group theoretical framework,
and provide explicit computations and specific examples. Moreover, we prove
that this approach can be used in the case of finite point sets with
icosahedral symmetry, which have a wide range of applications in carbon
chemistry (fullerenes) and biology (viral capsids).

at MHz frequencies, a detector timing synchronization within 1 ns is needed.
Large distributed radio detector arrays such as the Auger Engineering Radio
Array (AERA) rely on timing via the Global Positioning System (GPS) for the
synchronization of individual detector station clocks. Unfortunately, GPS
timing is expected to have an accuracy no better than about 5 ns. In practice,
in particular in AERA, the GPS clocks exhibit drifts on the order of tens of
ns. We developed a technique to correct for the GPS drifts, and an independent
method is used for cross-checks that indeed we reach nanosecond-scale timing
accuracy by this correction. First, we operate a ""beacon transmitter"" which
emits defined sine waves detected by AERA antennas recorded within the physics
data. The relative phasing of these sine waves can be used to correct for GPS
clock drifts. In addition to this, we observe radio pulses emitted by
commercial airplanes, the position of which we determine in real time from
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcasts intercepted with a software-defined
radio. From the known source location and the measured arrival times of the
pulses we determine relative timing offsets between radio detector stations. We
demonstrate with a combined analysis that the two methods give a consistent
timing calibration with an accuracy of 2 ns or better. Consequently, the beacon
method alone can be used in the future to continuously determine and correct
for GPS clock drifts in each individual event measured by AERA.

in the initial superposition in attaining localisation and delocalisation is
discussed. Effects of dissipation and decoherence are considered and the use of
quantum interference in reducing dissipation is explored. Many of the features
of the system are shown to be the consequences of quantum interference.

  Symposium in Seoul, 2016",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study experimentally fast flames and their transition to detonation in
mixtures of methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and propane mixtures with
oxygen. Following the interaction of a detonation wave with a column of
cylinders of varying blockage ratio, the experiments demonstrate that the fast
flames established are Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations, in excellent agreement
with the self-similar model of Radulescu et al. (2015). The experiments
indicate that these Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations dynamically restructure and
amplify into fewer stronger modes until the eventual transition to detonation.
The transition length to a self-sustained detonation was found to correlate
very well with the mixtures' sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, reflected
by the $\chi$ parameter introduced by Radulescu, which is the product of the
non-dimensional activation energy $E_a/RT$ and the ratio of chemical induction
to reaction time $t_i/t_r$. Correlation of the measured DDT lengths determined
that the relevant characteristic time scale from chemical kinetics controlling
DDT is the energy release or excitation time $t_r$. Correlations with the cell
size also capture the dependence of the DDT length on $\chi$ for fixed blockage
ratios.

superluminal motion lack direct evidence. Using high temporal resolution
imaging techniques, we demonstrate that if a source approaches an observer at
superluminal speeds, the temporal ordering of events is inverted and its image
appears to propagate backwards. If the source changes its speed, crossing the
interface between sub- and super-luminal propagation, we observe image pair
annihilation and creation. These results show that it is not possible to
unambiguously determine the kinematics of an event from imaging and
time-resolved measurements alone.

  '15",,,,"nlin.CG cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bottlenecks, i.e. local reductions of capacity, are one of the most relevant
scenarios of traffic systems. The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP)
with a defect is a minimal model for such a bottleneck scenario. One crucial
question is ""What is the critical strength of the defect that is required to
create global effects, i.e. traffic jams localized at the defect position"".
Intuitively one would expect that already an arbitrarily small bottleneck
strength leads to global effects in the system, e.g. a reduction of the maximal
current. Therefore it came as a surprise when, based on computer simulations,
it was claimed that the reaction of the system depends in non-continuous way on
the defect strength and weak defects do not have a global influence on the
system. Here we reconcile intuition and simulations by showing that indeed the
critical defect strength is zero. We discuss the implications for the analysis
of empirical and numerical data.

concentrate on formal systems not only for the sake of showing how there is a
fundamental mathematical structure to biology, but also to consider and
reconsider philosophical and phenomenological points of view in relation to
natural science and mathematics. The relationship with phenomenology comes
about in the questions that arise about the nature of the observer in relation
to the observed that arise in philosophy, but also in science in the very act
of determining the context and models upon which it shall be based.We examine
the schema behind the reproduction of DNA. The DNA molecule consists of two
interwound strands, the Watson Strand (W) and the Crick Strand (C). The two
strands are bonded to each other via a backbone of base-pairings and these
bonds can be broken by certain enzymes present in the cell. In reproduction of
DNA the bonds between the two strands are broken and the two strands then
acquire the needed complementary base molecules from the cellular environment
to reconstitute each a separate copy of the DNA. At this level the situation
can be described by a symbolism like this. DNA = <W|C> -------> <W| E |C>
--------> <W| |C><W| |C> = <W|C><W|C> = DNA DNA. Here E stands for the
environment of the cell. The first arrow denotes the separation of the DNA into
the two strands. The second arrow denotes the action between the bare strands
and the environment that leads to the production of the two DNA molecules. The
paper considers and compares many formalisms for self-replication, including
aspects of quantum formalism and the Temperley-Lieb algebra.

electronic structure theory. The Kohn-Sham method, based on a fictitious system
of non-interacting particles, is the work horse of the theory. The particular
form of the Kohn-Sham wavefunction admits only idem-potent one electron density
matrices whereas wavefunctions of correlated electrons in post-Hartree-Fock
methods invariably have fractional occupation numbers. Here we show that by
generalizing the orbital concept, and introducing a suitable dot-product as
well as a probability density a non-interacting system can be chosen that can
represent the one-electron density matrix of any system, even one with
fractional occupation numbers. This fictitious system ensures that the exact
electron density is accessible within density functional theory. It can also
serve as the basis for reduced density matrix functional theory. Moreover, to
aid the analysis of the results the orbitals may be assigned energies from a
mean-field Hamiltonian. This produces energy levels that are akin to
Hartree-Fock orbital energies such that conventional analyses based on Koopmans
theorem are available. Finally, this system is convenient in formalisms that
depend on creation and annihilation operators as they are trivially applied to
single determinant wavefunctions.

underestimates the total phonon scattering rate, and hence overestimates the
thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of mass-doped and Ge-doped silicon by about
20-40%. We have also directly estimated this coupling scattering rate, so
called coupled five-phonon scattering $\tau_{\rm couple}^{-1}$, and achieved
good agreement between $\tau_a^{-1}+\tau_i^{-1}+\tau_{\rm couple}^{-1}$ and the
total scattering rate $\tau_{tot}^{-1}$.

the most evident non-linear variation of the bulk modulus versus the
