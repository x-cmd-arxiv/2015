innovation (FRI). Every image in our model is the restriction of
$\mathds{1}_{\{p\leq0\}}$ to the image plane, where $\mathds{1}$ denotes the
indicator function and $p$ is some real bivariate polynomial. This particularly
means that the boundaries in the image form a subset of an algebraic curve with
the implicit polynomial $p$. We show that the image parameters --i.e., the
polynomial coefficients-- satisfy a set of linear annihilation equations with
the coefficients being the image moments. The inherent sensitivity of the
moments to noise makes the reconstruction process numerically unstable and
narrows the choice of the sampling kernels to polynomial reproducing kernels.
As a remedy to these problems, we replace conventional moments with more stable
\emph{generalized moments} that are adjusted to the given sampling kernel. The
benefits are threefold: (1) it relaxes the requirements on the sampling
kernels, (2) produces annihilation equations that are robust at numerical
precision, and (3) extends the results to images with unbounded boundaries. We
further reduce the sensitivity of the reconstruction process to noise by taking
into account the sign of the polynomial at certain points, and sequentially
enforcing measurement consistency. We consider various numerical experiments to
demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in reconstructing binary images,
including low to moderate noise levels and a range of realistic sampling
kernels.

introduces and studies the class of semi-galois categories, which extend galois
categories and are dual to profinite monoids in the same way as galois
categories are dual to profinite groups; the study on this class of categories
is aimed at providing an axiomatic reformulation of Eilenberg's theory of
varieties of regular languages--- a branch in formal language theory that has
been developed since the mid 1960's and particularly concerns systematic
classification of regular languages, finite monoids, and deterministic finite
automata. In this paper, detailed proofs of our central results announced at
LICS'16 are presented, together with topos-theoretic considerations. The main
results include (I) a proof of the duality theorem between profinite monoids
and semi-galois categories, extending the duality theorem between profinite
groups and galois categories; based on this results on semi-galois categories,
we then discuss (II) a reinterpretation of Eilenberg's theory from a viewpoint
of duality theorem; in relation with this reinterpretation of the theory, (III)
we also give a purely topos-theoretic characterization of classifying topoi BM
of profinite monoids M among general coherent topoi, which is a topos-theoretic
application of (I). This characterization states that a topos E is equivalent
to the classifying topos BM of some profinite monoid M if and only if E is (i)
coherent, (ii) noetherian, and (iii) has a surjective coherent point. This
topos-theoretic consideration is related to the logical and geometric problems
concerning Eilenberg's theory that we addressed at LICS'16, which remain open

space and time. Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important challenge
for the Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, it
is helpful to automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents
such as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal
stop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident
detection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an
automated tool for further classification. In literature, there is a lack of
research for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC
method is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed
method, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and
converted as spatial-temporal (ST) signals. Based on the characteristics of the
ST signals, a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an
extended big traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a
Mean-Shift filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract
significant features from the ST signals. The extracted features are then
associated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and
multiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive
boosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data
automatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted
to train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this
hybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM)
method. Experimental results show that the proposed AB-SVM method achieves a
satisfied result with more than 92% classification accuracy on average.

qualitatively new facets of behavior as compared to active matter that becomes

ACLCs: (i) externally driven ACLCs, in which the motion of colloidal particles
is powered by an externally applied electric field, and (ii) internally driven
ACLCs, formed by self-propelled particles such as bacteria. The liquid crystal
(LC) medium is of a thermotropic type in the first case and lyotropic (water
based) in the second case. In the absence of external fields and self-propelled
particles, the ACLCs are inactive, with the equilibrium LC state exhibiting
long-range orientational order. The external electric field causes ACLCs of
type (i) to experience translations, rotations, and orbiting, powered by
mechanisms such as LC-enabled electrokinetics, Quincke rotations and entrapment
at the defects of LC order. A dense system of Quincke rotators, orbiting along
circularly shaped smectic defects, undergoes a transition into a collective
coherent orbiting when their activity increases. An example of internally
driven ACLCs of type (ii) is living liquid crystals, representing swimming
bacteria placed in an otherwise passive lyotropic chromonic LC. The LC strongly
affects many aspects of bacterial behavior, most notably by shaping their
trajectories. As the concentration of bacteria and their activity increase, the
orientational order of living liquid crystals experiences two-stage
instability: first, the uniform steady equilibrium director is replaced with a
periodic bend deformation, then, at higher activity, pairs of positive and
negative disclinations nucleate, separate, and annihilate in dynamic patterns
of topological turbulence. The ACLCs are contrasted to their isotropic
counterparts.

(EMd) theories and extend it to the case of theories with multiple massless
gauge fields. We show that the MS bound, which in the context of condensed
matter provides information on the integrability of the theory, is saturated in
these holographic theories including R-charged backgrounds. We then explore the
limits of this universality by studying EMd theories with $U(1)$ spontaneous
symmetry breaking and gravity duals of non-relativistic field theories
including an asymptotically Lifshitz EMd model with two massless gauge fields
and the Einstein-Proca model. In all these cases, the Drude weight, computed
analytically, deviates from the universal result and the MS bound is not
saturated. In general it is not possible to deduce the low temperature
dependence of the Drude weight by simple dimensional analysis. Finally we study
the effect of a weak breaking of translational symmetry by coupling the EMd
action, with and without $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking, to an axion
field. We show the coherent part of the conductivity in this limit is simply
the product of the MS bound and the scattering time obtained from the leading
quasinormal mode. For asymptotically $AdS$ theories it seems that the MS bound
sets a lower bound on the DC conductivity for a given scattering time.

much work has been done towards classifying the rational homotopy types of
simply connected topological places. The majority of this work has focused on
rational homotopy types with the same cohomology algebra. The models in this
case were differential graded algebras and acted similarly to differential
forms. These models were then used together with some deformation theory to
describe a moduli space for all rational homotopy types with a given cohomology
algebra. Indeed, this theory has been very well developed. However, there is
another case to consider. That is, the collection of rational homotopy types
with the same homotopy Lie algebra (same homotopy groups and Whitehead product
structure). This case, arguably, is closer to the heart of homotopy theory, as
it fixes the homotopy groups themselves and how they interact with each other.
However, the Lie case has received less attention and is less developed than
its cohomology counterpart. The main purpose of this paper is to completely
develop the theory for rational homotopy types of simply-connected topological
spaces with the same homotopy Lie algebra. It will include some foundations of
the theory as well as some new work. Often, previously-known results will be
streamlined, reworded, or reproven to make them directly relevant to the
results of this paper. By the end of the paper, deformation theory will be
developed and the moduli space for rational homotopy types with a fixed
homotopy Lie algebra will be defined and justified.

Prior information on images is often employed to restore the sharpness of the

prior information to use in restoring from a blur kernel due to complex image
blurring processes. In this paper, we propose modelling of a blur kernel as a
sparse linear combinations of basic 2-D patterns. Our approach has a

are controlled by the relative height of the barriers separating the three

characterized both in terms of the current gain, which can be greater than
unity, and the power output of the device.

stabilised by the Kapitsa phenomenon, in which high-frequency low-amplitude
vertical vibrations of the base creates a fictitious force which opposes the
gravitational force. By transforming the dynamical equations governing a fluid

induced in fluid systems by properly tuned vibrations. We construct a
""dictionary""-type relationship between various pendula and the classical
Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Plateau and the self-gravitational
instabilities. This makes several results in control theory and dynamical
systems directly applicable to the study of ""tunable"" fluid instabilities,

is dominated by Ly$\alpha$ photons. We investigate the impact of stellar
Ly$\alpha$ irradiation on the terrestrial planet region of disks ($\lesssim
1$AU) using an updated thermal-chemical model of a disk atmosphere irradiated
by stellar FUV and X-rays. The radiative transfer of Ly$\alpha$ is implemented
in a simple approach that includes scattering by H I and absorption by
molecules and dust. Because of their non-radial propagation path, scattered
Ly$\alpha$ photons deposit their energy deeper in the disk atmosphere than the
radially propagating FUV continuum photons. We find that Ly$\alpha$ has a
significant impact on the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Photochemical
heating produced by scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons interacting with water vapor
and OH leads to a layer of hot (1500 - 2500 K) molecular gas. The temperature
in the layer is high enough to thermally excite the H$_2$ to vibrational levels
from which they can be fluoresced by Ly$\alpha$ to produce UV fluorescent H$_2$
emission. The resulting atmospheric structure may help explain the origin of UV
fluorescent H$_2$ that is commonly observed from classical T Tauri stars.

small inertia the system is no more chaotic and one observes mainly quasi-
periodic chimeras, while the usual (stationary) chimera state is not anymore
observable. At large inertia one observes two different kind of chaotic
solutions with broken symmetry: the intermittent chaotic chimera, characterized
by a synchronized population and a population displaying a turbulent behaviour,
and a second state where the two populations are both chaotic but whose
dynamics adhere to two different macroscopic attractors. The intermittent
chaotic chimeras are characterized by a finite life-time, whose duration
increases as a power-law with the system size and the inertia value. Moreover,
the chaotic population exhibits clear intermittent behavior, displaying a
laminar phase where the two populations tend to synchronize, and a turbulent
phase where the macroscopic motion of one population is definitely erratic. In
the thermodynamic limit these states survive for infinite time and the laminar
regimes tends to disappear, thus giving rise to stationary chaotic solutions
with broken symmetry contrary to what observed for chaotic chimeras on a ring
geometry.

active galactic nuclei and constraints on the diffuse radiation fields that
fill the Universe. The detection of significant emission above 100 GeV from a
distant quasar would show that some of the radiated gamma rays escape
pair-production interactions with low-energy photons, be it the extragalactic
background light (EBL), or the radiation near the supermassive black hole lying
at the jet's base. VERITAS detected gamma-ray emission up to 200 GeV from PKS
1441+25 (z=0.939) during April 2015, a period of high activity across all
wavelengths. This observation of PKS 1441+25 suggests that the emission region
is located thousands of Schwarzschild radii away from the black hole. The
gamma-ray detection also sets a stringent upper limit on the near-ultraviolet

most, if not all, of the sources of the EBL at these wavelengths.

detected between 40 and 250 GeV with a significance of 25.5 {\sigma} using the
MAGIC telescopes. Together with the gravitationally lensed blazar QSO B0218+357
(z = 0.944), PKS 1441+25 is the most distant very high energy (VHE) blazar
detected to date. The observations were triggered by an outburst in 2015 April
seen at GeV energies with the Large Area Telescope on board Fermi.
Multi-wavelength observations suggest a subdivision of the high state into two
distinct flux states. In the band covered by MAGIC, the variability time scale
is estimated to be 6.4 +/- 1.9 days. Modeling the broadband spectral energy
distribution with an external Compton model, the location of the emitting
region is understood as originating in the jet outside the broad line region
(BLR) during the period of high activity, while being partially within the BLR
during the period of low (typical) activity. The observed VHE spectrum during
the highest activity is used to probe the extragalactic background light at an
unprecedented distance scale for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.

stable hyperbolic limit cycle, for initial data that are attracted to the limit
cycle. The analysis is performed in the limit of small noise - that is, we
modulate the noise by a factor $\varepsilon \searrow 0$ - and on a long time
horizon. We prove explicit estimates on the proximity of the noisy trajectory
and the limit cycle up to times $\exp\left(c \varepsilon^{-2}\right)$, $c>0$,
and we show both that on the time scale $\varepsilon^{-2}$ the ""'dephasing""
(i.e., the difference between noiseless and noisy system measured in a natural
coordinate system that involves a phase) is close to a Brownian motion with
constant drift, and that on longer time scales the dephasing dynamics is
dominated, to leading order, by the drift. The natural choice of coordinates,
that reduces the dynamics in a neighborhood of the cycle to a rotation, plays a
central role and makes the connection with the applied science literature in
which noisy limit cycle dynamics are often reduced to a diffusion model for the
phase of the limit cycle.

stellar parameters, high-resolution imaging to identify companion stars, and,
in the case of binaries, fitting light curves to identify the likely planet
host. In 49 of 54 systems we validated the primary as the host star. We
inferred the intrinsic distribution of M dwarf planets using the method of
iterative Monte Carlo simulation. We compared several models of planet orbital
geometry and clustering and found that one where planets are exponentially
distributed and almost precisely coplanar best describes the distribution of
multi-planet systems. We determined that $Kepler$ M dwarfs host an average of
$2.2 \pm 0.3$ planets with radii of 1-4$R_{\oplus}$ and orbital periods of
1.5-180 d. The radius distribution peaks at $\sim 1.2R_{\oplus}$ and is
essentially zero at $4R_{\oplus}$, although we identify three giant planet
candidates other than the previously confirmed Kepler-45b. There is suggestive
but not significant evidence that the radius distribution varies with orbital
period. The distribution with logarithmic orbital period is flat except for a
decline for orbits less than a few days. Twelve candidate planets, including
two Jupiter-size objects, experience an irradiance below the threshold level
for a runaway greenhouse on an Earth-like planet and are thus in a ""habitable
zone"".

active nematic liquid-crystal is coupled to a minimal model of polymer dynamics
with a viscoelastic relaxation time $\tau_C$. To explore the resulting
interplay between active and polymeric dynamics, we first generalise a linear
stability analysis (from earlier studies without polymer) to derive criteria
for the onset of spontaneous heterogeneous flows (strain rate) and/or
deformations (strain). We find two modes of instability. The first is a viscous
mode, associated with strain rate perturbations. It dominates for relatively
small values of $\tau_C$ and is a simple generalisation of the instability
known previously without polymer. The second is an elastomeric mode, associated
with strain perturbations, which dominates at large $\tau_C$ and persists even
as $\tau_C\to\infty$. We explore the novel dynamical states to which these
instabilities lead by means of direct numerical simulations. These reveal
oscillatory shear-banded states in 1D, and activity-driven turbulence in 2D
even in the elastomeric limit $\tau_C\to\infty$. Adding polymer can also have
calming effects, increasing the net throughput of spontaneous flow along a
channel in a new type of ""drag-reduction"". Finally the effect of including
strong, antagonistic coupling between nematic and polymer is examined
numerically, revealing a rich array of spontaneously flowing states.

correlations are reported in bins of $q^2$, the invariant mass squared of the
dimuon system. The observables are determined both from an unbinned maximum
likelihood fit and by using the principal moments of the angular distribution.
In addition, by fitting for $q^2$-dependent decay amplitudes in the region
$1.1<q^{2}<6.0\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V}^{2}/c^{4}$, the zero-crossing points
of several angular observables are computed. A global fit is performed to the
complete set of $C\!P$-averaged observables obtained from the maximum
likelihood fit. This fit indicates differences with predictions based on the
Standard Model at the level of 3.4 standard deviations. These differences could
be explained by contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, or by an
unexpectedly large hadronic effect that is not accounted for in the Standard
Model predictions.

linear covariant gauge and subsequently renormalize it at two loops in the
MSbar scheme. The coupling constant corresponding to the gauge interaction is
asymptotically free for all numbers of quark fields, Nf. Analysing the
beta-functions yields a rich spectrum of fixed points. For instance, the
conformal window in the six dimensional theory is at Nf = 16 for the SU(3)
colour group. The critical theory structure is similar to that of an O(N)
scalar theory in eight dimensions. Using the large N expansion the latter is
shown to be in the same universality class as the Heisenberg ferromagnet.
Similarly using the large Nf expansion, six dimensional QCD is shown to be in
the same class as the two dimensional non-abelian Thirring model and four
dimensional QCD. Abelian gauge theories are also renormalized at high loops in
six and eight dimensions. It is shown that the gauge parameter only appears in
the electron anomalous dimension at one loop, similar to four dimensions.

mechanical systems. In this area, the governing equations for the motion of the
mechanical system are built following two steps: (a) Postulating a discrete
action; (b) Computing the stationary value for the discrete action. The former
is formulated by considering Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) systems with the
discrete action being constructed through numerical approximations of the
action integral. The latter derives the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations whose
solutions give the variational time integrator. In this paper, we build
variational time integrators in the context of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH). So, we start with a variational formulation of SPH for fluids. Then, we
apply the generalized midpoint rule, which depends on a parameter $\alpha$, in
order to generate the discrete action. Then, the step (b) yields a variational
time integration scheme that reduces to a known explicit one if
$\alpha\in\{0,1\}$ but it is implicit otherwise. Hence, we design a fixed point
iterative method to approximate the solution and prove its convergence
condition. Besides, we show that the obtained discrete Euler-Lagrange equations
preserve linear momentum. In the experimental results, we consider artificial
viscous as well as boundary interaction effects and simulate a dam breaking set
up. We compare the explicit and implicit SPH solutions and analyze momentum
conservation of the dam breaking simulations.

the Lyapunov decay depends strongly on the type of initial state upon which an
average is done. This dependence can be removed by averaging the fidelity over
the Haar measure, and the Lyapunov regime is recovered, as it was shown for
quantum maps. In this work we introduce an analogous quantity for systems with

and that this variation is organized by first ionization potential (FIP).
Previous studies have shown that in the solar corona low-FIP elements, such as
Fe, Si, Mg, and Ca, are generally enriched relative to high-FIP elements, such
as C, N, O, Ar, and Ne. In this paper we report on measurements of plasma
composition made during impulsive heating events observed at transition region
temperatures with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode.
During these events the intensities of O IV, V, and VI emission lines are
enhanced relative to emission lines from Mg V, VI, and VII and Si VI and VII
and indicate a composition close to that of the photosphere. Long-lived coronal
fan structures, in contrast, show an enrichment of low-FIP elements. We
conjecture that the plasma composition is an important signature of the coronal
heating process, with impulsive heating leading to the evaporation of
unfractionated material from the lower layers of the solar atmosphere and
higher frequency heating leading to long-lived structures and the accumulation
of low-FIP elements in the corona.

The flare emissions, the first simultaneous observations in two mid-infrared
bands at $5\ \mu$m and $8\ \mu$m with white-light and hard X-ray coverage,
revealed impulsive time variability with increases on time scales of $\sim 4$~s
followed by exponential decay at $\sim$10 s in two bright regions separated by
about 13$""$. The brightest source is compact, unresolved spatially at the
diffraction limit ($1.3""$ at $5\ \mu$m). We identify the IR sources as flare
ribbons also seen in white-light emission at 6173~\AA~observed by SDO/HMI, with
twin hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI, and with EUV sources (e.g., 94~\AA)
observed by SDO/AIA. The two infrared points have closely the same flux density
($f_\nu$, W/m$^2$Hz) and extrapolate to a level about an order of magnitude
below that observed in the visible band by HMI, but with a flux more than two
orders of magnitude above the free-free continuum from the hot ($\sim$15 MK)
coronal flare loop observed in the X-ray range. The observations suggest that
the IR emission is optically thin, this constraint and others suggest major
contributions from a density less than about $3 \times 10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. We

regions of protoplanetary discs, the dead zones (DZs), is not understood. The
presence of a DZ naturally leads to conditions susceptible to the Rossby wave
instability (RWI), which produces vortices and spiral density waves that may
revive the DZ and be responsible for observed large-scale disc structures. We
present a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the
role of the RWI in DZs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of the
disc and its morphology. The nonlinear RWI can generate Reynolds stresses
(effective $\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the DZ, helping to
sustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. It also produces novel disc
morphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypical
vortex shapes. The angular momentum transport strength and morphology are most
sensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the DZ and the disc
viscosity. The largest Reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent of
the DZ is less than its distance to the central star. Such narrow DZs lead to a
single vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. The
edges of wider DZs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices and
reduced angular momentum transport efficiency. In either case, we find that,
because of the Reynolds stresses generated by the nonlinear RWI, gravitational
instability is unlikely to play a role in angular momentum transport across the
DZ, unless the accretion rate is sufficiently high.

extension of the DebtRank algorithm, recently introduced in the literature. The
mechanics of distress propagation is very simple: When a bank suffers a loss,
distress propagates to its creditors, who in turn suffer losses, and so on. The
original DebtRank assumes that losses are propagated linearly between connected
banks. Here we relax this assumption and introduce a one-parameter family of
non-linear propagation functions. As a case study, we apply this algorithm to a
data-set of 183 European banks, and we study how the stability of the system
depends on the non-linearity parameter under different stress-test scenarios.
We find that the system is characterized by a transition between a regime where
small shocks can be amplified and a regime where shocks do not propagate, and
that the overall stability of the system increases between 2008 and 2013.

lowest-lying KK-mode of the RR-2-form-potential $C_2$ in the standard
Klebanov-Strassler throat. One can think of this inflaton candidate as being
defined by the integral of $C_2$ over the $S^2$ cycle of the throat. It obtains
an exponentially small mass from the IR-region in which the $S^2$ shrinks to
zero size both with respect to the Planck scale and the mass scale of local
modes of the throat. Crucially, the $S^2$ cycle has to be shared between two
throats, such that the second locus where the $S^2$ shrinks is also in a warped
region. Well-known problems like the potentially dangerous back-reaction of
brane/antibrane pairs and explicit supersymmetry breaking are not present in
our scenario. However, the inflaton back-reaction starts to deform the geometry
strongly once the field excursion approaches the Planck scale. We derive the
system of differential equations required to treat this effect quantitatively.
Numerical work is required to decide whether back-reaction makes the model
suitable for realistic inflation. While we have to leave this crucial issue to
future studies, we find it interesting that such a simple and explicit stringy
monodromy model allows an originally sub-Planckian axion to go through many
periods with full quantitative control before back-reaction becomes strong.
Also, the mere existence of our ultra-light throat mode (with double
exponentially suppressed mass) is noteworthy.

of the predicted long GRB redshift probability distribution observable by the
Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), we estimate the probability distributions
for the jet opening angle and rest-frame energetics for a large sample of GBM
GRBs for which the redshifts have not been observed. Previous studies have only
used a handful of GRBs to estimate these properties due to the paucity of
observed afterglow jet breaks, spectroscopic redshifts, and comprehensive
prompt gamma-ray observations, and we potentially expand the number of GRBs
that can be used in this analysis by more than an order of magnitude. In this
analysis, we also present an inferred distribution of jet breaks which
indicates that a large fraction of jet breaks are not observable with current
instrumentation and observing strategies. We present simple parameterizations

inverse problems. We are particularly interested in cases where the cost of
each likelihood evaluation (forward-model call) is expensive and the number of
un- known (latent) variables is high. This is the setting in many problems in
com- putational physics where forward models with nonlinear PDEs are used and
the parameters to be calibrated involve spatio-temporarily varying
coefficients, which upon discretization give rise to a high-dimensional vector
of unknowns. One of the consequences of the well-documented ill-posedness of
inverse prob- lems is the possibility of multiple solutions. While such
information is contained in the posterior density in Bayesian formulations, the
discovery of a single mode, let alone multiple, is a formidable task. The goal
of the present paper is two- fold. On one hand, we propose approximate,
adaptive inference strategies using mixture densities to capture multi-modal
posteriors, and on the other, to ex- tend our work in [1] with regards to
effective dimensionality reduction techniques that reveal low-dimensional
subspaces where the posterior variance is mostly concentrated. We validate the
model proposed by employing Importance Sam- pling which confirms that the bias
introduced is small and can be efficiently corrected if the analyst wishes to
do so. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy in nonlinear
elastography where the identification of the mechanical properties of
biological materials can inform non-invasive, medical di- agnosis. The
discovery of multiple modes (solutions) in such problems is critical in

present an organic (Cu-phthalocyanine)-2D layered material (MoS2) hybrid p-n
junction with both gate-tunable diode characteristics and photovoltaic effect.
Our proof-of-principle devices show multifunctional properties with diode
rectifying factors of up to 10^4, while under light exposure they exhibit
photoresponse with a measured external quantum efficiency of ~ 11 %. As for
their photovoltaic properties, we found open circuit voltages of up to 0.6 V
and optical-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 0.7 %. The extended
catalogue of known organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials offer
the prospect for tailoring the properties and the performance of the resulting
devices, making organic-2D p-n junctions promising candidates for future
technological applications.

that once a certain amount of large dust particles form, even though it is much

neuroinflammation, which is thought to be detrimental for the neurons
surrounding the electrode. Mechanisms of this type of neuroinflammation are
still not understood well. Recent experimental and theoretical results point
out possible role of the diffusion species in this process. The paper considers
a model of anomalous diffusion occurring in the glial scar around a chronic
implant in two simple geometries -- a separable rectilinear electrode and a
cylindrical electrode, which are solvable exactly. We describe a hypothetical
extended source of diffusing species and study its concentration profile in
steady-state conditions. Diffusion transport is assumed to obey a
fractional-order Fick law, which is derived from physically realistic
assumptions using a fractional calculus approach. The derived fractional-order
distribution morphs into regular order diffusion in the case of integer
fractional exponents. The model presented here demonstrates that accumulation
of diffusing species can occur and the scar properties (i.e. tortuosity,
fractional order, scar thickness) can influence such accumulation. The observed
shape of the concentration profile corresponds qualitatively with GFAP profiles
reported in the literature. The main difference with respect to the previous
studies is the explicit incorporation of the apparatus of fractional calculus
without assumption of an ad hoc tortuosity parameter. Intended application of
the approach is the study of diffusing substances in the glial scar after
implantation of neural prostheses, although the approach can be adapted to
other studies of diffusion in biological tissues, for example of biomolecules
or small drug molecules.

interesting physical properties, such as low-temperature superconductivity,
hidden spin polarization, and electrically tunable Dirac cones. However, it was
generally assumed that each LaOBiS2-type compound has a unique and specific
crystallographic structure (with a space group P4/nmm) separated from other
phases. Using first-principles total energy and stability calculations we
confirm that the previous assignment of the centrosymetric P4/nmm structure to
LaOBiS2 is incorrect as a phonon instability renders this structure impossible.
Furthermore, we find that the unstable structure is replaced by a family of
energetically closely spaced modifications (polytypes) differing by the layer
sequences and orientations. We find that the local Bi-S distortion leads to
three polytypes of LaOBiS2 with different stacking patterns of the distorted
BiS2 layers. The energy difference between the polytypes of LaOBiS2 is merely
~1 meV/u.c., indicating the possible coexistence of all polytypes in the real
sample and that the particular distribution of polytypes may be growth-induced.
The in-plane distortion can be suppressed by pressure, leading to a phase
transition from polytypes to the high-symmetry P4/nmm structure with a pressure
larger than 2.5 GPa. In addition, different choices of the intermediate atoms
(replacing La) or active atoms (BiS2) could also manifest different ground
state structures. One can thus tune the distortion and the ground state by
pressure or substituting covalence atoms in LaOBiS2-family.

identified by $i$ and the leading $i-j$ bits of the binary representation of

to the data, which undermines Kolmogorov's approach: the best hypotheses should
not have irrelevant information.
  To restrict the class of hypotheses for a data $x$ to those that have only
relevant information, Vereshchagin introduced a notion of a strong model for
$x$: those are models for $x$ whose total conditional complexity conditional to
$x$ is negligible. An object $x$ is called normal if for each complexity level

discussed and explored. The effect relies on the interaction of magnetic
fluctuations with a mean shear flow, meaning the saturated state of the
small-scale dynamo can drive a large-scale dynamo -- in some sense the inverse
of dynamo quenching. The dynamo is nonhelical, with the mean-field $\alpha$
coefficient zero, and is caused by the interaction between an off-diagonal
component of the turbulent resistivity and the stretching of the large-scale
field by shear flow. Following up on previous numerical and analytic work, this
paper presents further details of the numerical evidence for the effect, as
well as an heuristic description of how magnetic fluctuations can interact with
shear flow to produce the required electromotive force. The pressure response
of the fluid is fundamental to this mechanism, which helps explain why the
magnetic effect is stronger than its kinematic cousin, and the basic idea is
related to the well-known lack of turbulent resistivity quenching by magnetic
fluctuations. As well as being interesting for its applications to general high
Reynolds number astrophysical turbulence, where strong small-scale magnetic
fluctuations are expected to be prevalent, the magnetic shear-current effect is
a likely candidate for large-scale dynamo in the unstratified regions of

pattern of length $m$ and each location in a text of length $n$ is one of the
most fundamental algorithmic tasks in string algorithms. Unfortunately, there
is evidence that for a text $T$ of size $n$ and a pattern $P$ of size $m$, one
cannot compute the exact Hamming distance for all locations in $T$ in time
which is less than $\tilde O(n\sqrt m)$. However, Karloff~\cite{karloff} showed
that if one is willing to suffer a $1\pm\epsilon$ approximation, then it is
possible to solve the problem with high probability, in $\tilde O(\frac n
{\epsilon^2})$ time.
  Due to related lower bounds for computing the Hamming distance of two strings
in the one-way communication complexity model, it is strongly believed that
obtaining an algorithm for solving the approximation version cannot be done
much faster as a function of $\frac 1 \epsilon$. We show here that this belief
is false by introducing a new $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\epsilon})$ time algorithm
that succeeds with high probability.
  The main idea behind our algorithm, which is common in sparse recovery
problems, is to reduce the variance of a specific randomized experiment by
(approximately) separating heavy hitters from non-heavy hitters. However, while
known sparse recovery techniques work very well on vectors, they do not seem to
apply here, where we are dealing with mismatches between pairs of characters.
We introduce two main algorithmic ingredients. The first is a new sparse
recovery method that applies for pair inputs (such as in our setting). The
second is a new construction of hash/projection functions, which allows to
count the number of projections that induce mismatches between two characters
exponentially faster than brute force. We expect that these algorithmic
techniques will be of independent interest.

the processes that couple jet power to the ambient medium and determine jet
morphology are poorly understood. For instance, there is no agreement on the
cause of the well-known Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological dichotomy of jets,
with FRI jets being shorter and less stable than FRII jets. We carry out global
3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets propagating through the
ambient medium. We show that the flat density profiles of galactic cores slow
down and collimate the jets, making them susceptible to the 3D magnetic kink
instability. We obtain a critical power, which depends on the galaxy core mass
and radius, below which jets become kink-unstable within the core, stall, and
inflate cavities filled with relativistically-hot plasma. Jets above the
critical power stably escape the core and form powerful backflows. Thus, the
kink instability controls the jet morphology and can lead to the FR dichotomy.
The model-predicted dependence of the critical power on the galaxy optical
luminosity agrees well with observations.

process, anyons created by some thermal environment end up trapped in potential
""trenches"" that they themselves generate, which can be interpreted as a ""memory
foam"" for anyons. This self-trapping mechanism provides an energy barrier for
anyon propagation, and removes entropy from the memory by favoring anyon
recombination over anyon separation (responsible for memory errors). We
demonstrate that our scheme leads to an exponential increase of the
memory-coherence time with system size $L$, up to an upper bound
$L_\mathrm{max}$ which can increase exponentially with $\Delta/T$, where $T$ is
the temperature and $\Delta$ is some energy scale defined by potential
trenches. This results in a double exponential increase of the memory time with
$\Delta/T$, which greatly improves over the Arrhenius (single-exponential)

evolution. It is needed to explain many close binary stellar systems, such as
cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernova progenitors, or X-ray binaries. To
form the resulting close binary, the initial orbit has to shrink, thereby
transferring energy to the primary giant's envelope that is hence ejected. The
details of this interaction, however, are still not understood. Here, we
present new hydrodynamic simulations of the dynamical spiral-in forming a CE
system. We apply the moving-mesh code AREPO to follow the interaction of a
$1M_\odot$ compact star with a $2M_\odot$ red giant possessing a $0.4M_\odot$
core. The nearly Lagrangian scheme combines advantages of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics and traditional grid-based hydrodynamic codes and allows us to
capture also small flow features at high spatial resolution. Our simulations
reproduce the initial transfer of energy and angular momentum from the binary
core to the envelope by spiral shocks seen in previous studies, but after about
20 orbits a new phenomenon is observed. Large-scale flow instabilities are
triggered by shear flows between adjacent shock layers. These indicate the
onset of turbulent convection in the common envelope, thus altering the
transport of energy on longer time scales. At the end of our simulation, only
8% of the envelope mass is ejected. The failure to unbind the envelope

several timely servicing missions, the lifetime of JWST is finite and
relatively short, with a lifetime requirement of five years, and a ten-year
goal. Following the discussion session at the ""Exploring the Universe with

by their inability to reproduce the apparently `anti-hierarchical' evolution of
galaxy assembly: massive galaxies appear to be in place since $z\sim 3$, while
a significant increase of the number densities of low mass galaxies is measured
with decreasing redshift. In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of the
influence of different stellar feedback schemes, carried out in the framework
of GAEA, a new semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. It includes a
self-consistent treatment for the timings of gas, metal and energy recycling,
and for the chemical yields. We show this to be crucial to use observational
measurements of the metallicity as independent and powerful constraints for the
adopted feedback schemes. The observed trends can be reproduced in the
framework of either a strong ejective or preventive feedback model. In the
former case, the gas ejection rate must decrease significantly with cosmic time
(as suggested by parametrizations of the cosmological `FIRE' simulations).
Irrespective of the feedback scheme used, our successful models always imply
that up to 60-70 per cent of the baryons reside in an `ejected' reservoir and
are unavailable for cooling at high redshift. The same schemes predict physical
properties of model galaxies (e.g. gas content, colour, age, and metallicity)
that are in much better agreement with observational data than our fiducial
model. The overall fraction of passive galaxies is found to be primarily
determined by internal physical processes, with environment playing a secondary
role.

fluctuations. We use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification data and overlapping CMB lensing from
the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. The DES source galaxies have a
median redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the CMB lensing kernel is
broad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. The resulting cross-correlation is maximally
sensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. Assuming the Planck 2015
best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the DES$\times$SPT cross-power is found to
be $A = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from DES$\times$Planck to be $A = 0.86 \pm
0.39$, where $A=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. These are
consistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9
\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. We demonstrate that our results are
robust to a number of important systematic effects including the shear
measurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and CMB
lensing systematics. Significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes would
increase the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate a
value of $A = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for DES$\times$SPT when we correct the

cross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliable
evidence for any deviation from the expected LCDM level of cross-correlation,

for the first time. Naturally, neighbouring stream stars reach pericentre at
slightly different times. In the presence of a rotating bar, these neighbouring
stream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage
and hence each star receives a different torque from the bar. These differing
torques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the
stream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor
orbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance
condition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than
expected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur
along the bar's minor or major axis respectively. We present a full discussion
of this phenomenon focusing mainly on streams confined to the Galactic plane.
In stark contrast with the evolution in static potentials, which give rise to
streams that grow steadily in time, rotating barred potentials can produce
dynamically old, short streams. This challenges the traditional viewpoint that
the inner halo consists of well phase-mixed material whilst the
tidally-disrupted structures in the outer halo are more spatially coherent. We
argue that this mechanism plays an important role in explaining the
mysteriously short Ophiuchus stream that was recently discovered near the bulge
region of the Milky Way.

candidates. Here we consider a scenario in which ionising photons escape
through channels punctured in the interstellar medium by outflows powered by
starbursts. We take account of the observation that strong outflows occur only
when the star formation density is sufficiently high, and estimate the
galaxy-averaged escape fraction as a function of redshift and luminosity from
the resolved star formation surface densities in the EAGLE cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation. We find that the fraction of ionising photons that
escape from galaxies increases rapidly with redshift, reaching values of 5-20
percent at $z > 6$, with the brighter galaxies having higher escape fractions.
Combining the dependence of escape fraction on luminosity and redshift with the
observed luminosity function, we demonstrate that galaxies emit enough ionising
photons to match the existing constraints on reionisation while also matching
the observed UV-background post-reionisation. Our findings suggest that
galaxies above the current Hubble Space Telescope detection limit emit half of
the ionising radiation required to reionise the Universe.

generic edges. The flatness of these edge bands, which is protected by
time-reversal and translation symmetry, gives rise to an extensive ground-state
degeneracy. Therefore, even arbitrarily weak interactions lead to an
instability of the flat-band edge states towards time-reversal and
translation-symmetry-broken phases, which lift the ground-state degeneracy. We
examine the instabilities of the flat-band edge states of d_{xy}-wave
superconductors by performing a mean-field analysis in the Majorana basis of
the edge states. The leading instabilities are Majorana mass terms, which
correspond to coherent superpositions of particle-particle and particle-hole
channels in the fermionic language. We find that attractive interactions induce
three different mass terms. One is a coherent superposition of imaginary s-wave
pairing and current order, and another combines a charge-density-wave and
finite-momentum singlet pairing. Repulsive interactions, on the other hand,
lead to ferromagnetism together with spin-triplet pairing at the edge. Our
quantum Monte Carlo simulations confirm these findings and demonstrate that
these instabilities occur even in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations.
We discuss the implications of our results for experiments on cuprate
high-temperature superconductors.

Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) and its recent extension OMEGAWINGS, we
investigate the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$)
in galaxy clusters at $0.04<z<0.07$. We use non-member galaxies at
0.02$<$z$<$0.09 as field control sample. Overall, we find agreement between the
SFR-M$_*$ relation in the two environments, but detect a population of cluster
galaxies with reduced SFRs which is rare in the field. These {\it transition}
galaxies are mainly found within the cluster virial radius ($R_{200}$) but they
impact on the SFR-M$_*$ relation only within 0.6R$_{200}$. The ratio of
transition to PSF galaxies strongly depends on environment, being larger than
0.6 within 0.3R$_{200}$ and rapidly decreasing with distance, while it is
almost flat with $M_*$. As galaxies move downward from the SFR-M$_*$ main
sequence, they become redder and present older luminosity and mass weighted
ages. These trends, together with the analysis of the star formation histories,
suggest that transition galaxies have had a reduced SFR for the past 2-5 Gyr.
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of galaxies
with the intracluster medium via strangulation causes a gradual shut down of
star formation, giving birth to an evolved population of galaxies in transition
from being star forming to becoming passive.

significantly lower than the higher-luminosity, rarer quasars reported in

Using a suite of cosmological chemodynamical disc galaxy simulations,
we assess how (a) radial metallicity gradients evolve with scaleheight; (b) the
vertical metallicity gradients change through the thick disc; and (c) the
vertical gradient of the stellar rotation velocity varies through the disc. We
compare with the Milky Way to search for analogous trends. Methods. We analyse
five simulated spiral galaxies with masses comparable to the Milky Way. The
simulations span a range of star formation and energy feedback strengths and
prescriptions, particle- and grid-based hydrodynamical implementations, as well
as initial conditions/assembly history. Results. Consistently, we find that the
steeper, negative, radial metallicity gradients seen in the mid-plane flatten
with increasing height away from the plane. In simulations with stronger
(and/or more spatially-extended) feedback, the negative radial gradients
invert, becoming positive for heights in excess of 1 kpc. Such behaviour is
consistent with that inferred from recent observations. Our measurements of the
vertical metallicity gradients show no clear correlation with galactocentric
radius, and are in good agreement with those observed in the Milky Way's thick
disc (locally). Conclusions. Simulations employing stronger/more extended
feedback prescriptions possess radial and vertical metallicity and kinematic
gradients more in line with recent observations. The inverted, positive, radial
metallicity gradients seen in the simulated thick stellar discs originate from
a population of younger, more metal-rich, stars formed in-situ, superimposed
upon a background population of older migrators from the inner disc; the
contrast provided by the former increases radially, due to the inside-out
growth of the disc. A similar behaviour may be responsible for the same
flattening seen in the radial gradients with scaleheight in the Milky Way.

The measurements of D-meson production in pp collisions provide an important
test of pQCD calculations and serve as an essential baseline for the
comprehensive studies in heavy-ion collisions. The study of D-meson production
in p-Pb collisions is necessary to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects
from hot nuclear matter effects. The measurement of heavy-flavour production as
a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions could
provide insight into the role of multi-parton interactions at LHC energies.
  We present ALICE results on D-meson production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}
=$ 7 TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm {NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The D-meson
yields per event, measured in different multiplicity intervals and normalized
to their multiplicity-integrated values, are presented for pp and p-Pb
collisions. The $p_{\rm {T}}$-differential production cross section and nuclear
modification factor of prompt D mesons are measured in p-Pb collisions. The
nuclear modification factor, $R_\mathrm{pPb}$, is compatible with unity within
uncertainties, indicating that cold nuclear matter effects are small for
$p_{\mathrm{T}} \gtrsim 3$ GeV/$c$. The D-meson transverse momentum
distributions in p-Pb collisions relative to pp collisions, measured in several
multiplicity classes, are also discussed.

To accelerate statistical methods, many optimization techniques have been

iterative algorithms. For instance, using a relaxation parameter that is close
to two in alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been shown to
speed up convergence significantly. This paper proposes a relaxed linearized

with over-relaxation and applies the proposed relaxed linearized AL method to
X-ray CT image reconstruction problems. Experimental results with both

unrelaxed fast algorithms, with negligible computation and memory overhead.

endeavor is to understand the remarkable increase of the viscosity with
supercooling. Recently, a new theory of supercooled liquids has been proposed
that starts from first principles, using elementary statistical mechanics
arguments, to derive a form for the viscosity that contains only a single
fitting parameter in its simplest form. In this we demonstrate that this exact
same form may be derived from a different starting point, and then critically
examine its performance. In the process we find that functional form proposed
fits the viscosity data of a diverse group of 45 liquids exceptionally well
over a wide temperature range, and uncover a number of interesting correlations
of the single parameter with various thermodynamic quantities, ultimately
allowing for the prediction of low temperature viscosity from high temperature
data. Additionally, we find that similar physical reasoning can be used to
derive a similar, single parameter form for the viscosity of hard-sphere/jammed
liquids. We demonstrate that this form accurately reproduces the viscosity of
hard-spheres, suggesting an underlying universality in metastable dynamics.

two-level overlapping Schwarz algorithms with standard coarse spaces for the
almost incompressible linear elasticity and Stokes systems, discretized by
mixed finite and spectral element methods with discontinuous pressures. Two
different approaches are considered to solve the resulting saddle point
systems: a) a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method applied to the
symmetric positive definite reformulation of the almost incompressible linear
elasticity system obtained by eliminating the pressure unknowns; b) a GMRES
method with indefinite overlapping Schwarz preconditioner applied directly to
the saddle point formulation of both the elasticity and Stokes systems.
Condition number estimates and convergence properties of the proposed hybrid
and multiplicative overlapping Schwarz algorithms are proven for the positive
definite reformulation of almost incompressible elasticity. These results are
based on our previous study [8] where only additive Schwarz preconditioners
were considered for almost incompressible elasticity. Extensive numerical
experiments with both finite and spectral elements show that the proposed
overlapping Schwarz preconditioners are scalable, quasi-optimal in the number
of unknowns across individual subdomains and robust with respect to
discontinuities of the material parameters across subdomains interfaces. The
results indicate that the proposed preconditioners retain a good performance
also when the quasi-monotonicity assumption, required by the available theory,
does not hold.

the transition. The data is qualitatively explained by a phenomenological model
which incorporates a distribution of magnetic regions with different transition
temperatures ($T_N$). The universal behaviour of the low temperature specific
heat is found for La (vacancies) concentrations below $x=0.40$ which is
consistent with spin wave excitations. For $x=0.5$ this universal behaviour is

the hydrate-bearing sediments. During gas production, the geomechanical
stability of the sediment is compromised. Due to the potential geotechnical
risks and process management issues, the mechanical behavior of the gas
hydrate-bearing sediments needs to be carefully considered. In this study, we
describe a coupling concept that simplifies the mathematical description of the
complex interactions occuring during gas production by isolating the effects of
sediment deformation and hydrate phase changes. Central to this coupling
concept is the assumption that the soil grains form the load-bearing solid
skeleton, while the gas hydrate enhances the mechanical properties of this
skeleton. We focus on testing this coupling concept in capturing the overall
impact of geomechanics on gas production behavior though numerical simulation
of a high-pressure isotropic compression experiment combined with methane
hydrate formation and dissociation. We consider a linear-elastic stress-strain
relationship because it is uniquely defined and easy to calibrate. Since, in
reality, the geomechanical response of the hydrate bearing sediment is
typically inelastic and is characterized by a significant shear-volumetric
coupling, we control the experiment very carefully in order to keep the sample
deformations small and well within the assumptions of poro-elasticity. The
closely co-ordinated experimental and numerical procedures enable us to
validate the proposed simplified geomechanics-to-flow coupling, and set an
important precursor towards enhancing our coupled hydro-geomechanical hydrate

differentiate cells into 16 molecular types. The binary string value determines
cell fitness, with lower fit cells (e.g. 0000) defined as healthy phenotypes,
and higher fit cells (e.g. 1111) defined as malignant phenotypes. At each step
of the birth-death process, the two phenotypic sub-populations compete in a
prisoner's dilemma evolutionary game with healthy cells (cooperators) competing
with cancer cells (defectors). Fitness and birth-death rates are defined via
the prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix. Cells are able undergo two types of
stochastic point mutations passed to the daughter cell's binary string during
birth: passenger mutations (conferring no fitness advantage) and driver
mutations (increasing cell fitness). Dynamic phylogenetic trees show clonal
expansions of cancer cell sub-populations from an initial malignant cell. The

testing the null hypothesis that the mode of a directional signal is equal to a
given value. Motivated by a real data example where the signal is weak, we
consider this problem under asymptotic scenarios for which the signal strength
goes to zero at an arbitrary rate~$\eta_n$. Both under the null and the
alternative, we focus on rotationally symmetric distributions. We show that,
while they are asymptotically equivalent under fixed signal strength, the
classical Wald and Watson tests exhibit very different (null and non-null)

challenging the problem is as a function of~$\eta_n$, we adopt a Le Cam,
convergence-of-statistical-experiments, point of view and show that the
resulting limiting experiments crucially depend on~$\eta_n$. In the light of
these results, the Watson test is shown to be \emph{adaptively} rate-consistent

cosmogony typically require strong feedback from supernova (SN) explosions in

faint end of the field galaxy luminosity function. However, too strong a SN
feedback also leads to the universe reionizing too late, and the metallicities
of Milky Way satellites being too low. The combination of these four
observations therefore places tight constraints on SN feedback. We investigate
these constraints using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform. We
find that these observations favour a SN feedback model in which the feedback
strength evolves with redshift. We find that, for our best fit model, half of
the ionizing photons are emitted by galaxies with rest-frame far-UV absolute
magnitudes $M_{\rm AB}(1500{\rm \AA})<-17.5$, which implies that already
observed galaxy populations contribute about half of the photons responsible
for reionization. The $z=0$ descendants of these galaxies are mainly galaxies
with stellar mass $M_*>10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and preferentially inhabit
halos with mass $M_{\rm halo}>10^{13}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$.

small value of the fine-structure constant and the small size of the atom.
Overcoming these limitations is a long-standing challenge. Recent theoretical
and experimental breakthroughs have shown that two dimensional systems, such as
graphene, can support strongly confined light in the form of plasmons. These 2D
systems have a unique ability to squeeze the wavelength of light by over two
orders of magnitude. Such high confinement requires a revisitation of the main
assumptions of light-matter interactions. In this letter, we provide a general
theory of light-matter interactions in 2D systems which support plasmons. This
theory reveals that conventionally forbidden light-matter interactions, such
as: high-order multipolar transitions, two-plasmon spontaneous emission, and
spin-flip transitions can occur on very short time-scales - comparable to those
of conventionally fast transitions. Our findings enable new platforms for
spectroscopy, sensing, broadband light generation, and a potential test-ground

amidst frequent power interruptions of CRFID. With growing interest in the
market where CRFIDs are forever-embedded in many structures, it is necessary

adaptively change the frame length sent by the reader, based on the length
throttling mechanism, to minimize the transfer times at varying channel
conditions. We present an implementation of Wisent for the WISP 5 and an
off-the-shelf RFID reader. Our experiments show that Wisent allows transfer up
to 16 times faster than a baseline, non-adaptive shortest frame case, i.e.
single word length, at sub-meter distance. As a case study, we show how Wisent

3516 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope show that the visible spectrum is
dominated by the Balmer emission lines of Hydrogen (H) and a continuum
luminosity that rises into the UV. The anomalous H${\alpha}$/H${\beta}$
emission line ratio, the Balmer emission line luminosity and the distinctive
shape observed for the H${\alpha}$ emission line profile serve as important
constraints in any photoionization model aimed at explaining the visible
emission line spectrum of NGC 3516. Photoionization modeling using Cloudy
demonstrates that the central UV-X-ray source is able to completely ionize the
H gas in between the Balmer and dust reverberation radii if the electron
density is ${\le}$ 3 ${\times}$ 10${^7}$ cm${^{-3}}$ throughout. Thus,
according to this model the region responsible for producing the visible H
lines is a dust free shell of ionized H gas. Interestingly, the model predicts
a rapid rise in the electron temperature as the central UV-X-ray source is
approached, mirrored by an equally precipitous decrease in the Balmer line
emissivity that coincides with the Balmer reverberation radius, providing a
natural explanation for the finite width observed for the H Balmer lines.
Collectively, the merit of the model is that it explains the relative
intensities of the three brightest Balmer lines, and the shape of the
H${\alpha}$ emission line profile. However, questions remain concerning the
unusually weak forbidden lines that can not be addressed using Cloudy due to
limitations with the code.

enriching the semantic content of the image representation by using external

semantically rich representation for images would yield higher machine learning
performances, without the need to modify the learning algorithms themselves.
The external semantic information is presented under the form of non-positional
image labels, therefore positioning our work in a weakly supervised context.
Two approaches are proposed: the first one leverages the labels into the visual
vocabulary construction algorithm, the result being dedicated visual
vocabularies. The second approach adds a filtering phase as a pre-processing of
the vocabulary construction. Known positive and known negative sets are
constructed and features that are unlikely to be associated with the objects
denoted by the labels are filtered. We apply our proposition to the task of
content-based image classification and we show that semantically enriching the

potential wells and barriers have attracted great attention for their potential
to provide thermoelectric power factor improvements and higher ZT figure of
merit. Previous theoretical works have shown that the presence of optimized
potential barriers could provide improvements to the Seebeck coefficient
through carrier energy filtering, which improves the power factor by up to 40%.
However, experimental corroboration of this prediction has been extremely
scant. In this work, we employ quantum mechanical electronic transport
simulations to outline the detrimental effects of random variation,
imperfections and nonoptimal barrier shapes in a superlattice geometry on these
predicted power factor improvements. Thus we aim to assess either the
robustness or the fragility of these theoretical gains in the face of the types
of variation one would find in real material systems. We show that these power
factor improvements are relatively robust against: overly thick barriers,
diffusion of barriers into the body of the wells, and random fluctuations in
barrier spacing and width. However, notably, we discover that extremely thin
barriers and random fluctuation in barrier heights by as little as 10% is
sufficient to entirely destroy any power factor benefits of the optimized
geometry. Our results could provide performance optimization routes for
nanostructured thermoelectrics and elucidate the reasons why significant power
factor improvements are not commonly realized in superlattices, despite

it gets excited in the course of collision, and, in particular, at the moment
of perforation the shock branon wave is generated, which then expands with the

can be computed in a standard way, the total radiation source contains a
light-like part whose retarded field is quite non-trivial, exhibiting
interesting retardation and memory effects. We analyze this field in detail,
showing that, contrary to the claims that the light-like sources should not

computing its eigenvalues and eigenvectors represented using polynomial chaos
expansions. We formulate a version of stochastic inverse subspace iteration,
which is based on the stochastic Galerkin finite element method, and we compare
its accuracy with that of Monte Carlo and stochastic collocation methods. The
coefficients of the eigenvalue expansions are computed from a stochastic
Rayleigh quotient. Our approach allows the computation of interior eigenvalues

The effectiveness of the methods is illustrated by numerical experiments on

on top of a a self-assembled CCNT monolayer which creates parallel conducting

scattering due to defects in the graphene sheet, and reduces the sheet

chemically doping the hybrid. Moreover, the chemically doped hybrid is more

derived for a globally high- order accurate discretization of conservation laws

domain is transformed into one on a fixed reference domain by the introduction
of a time-dependent mapping that encapsulates the domain deformation and
parametrization, resulting in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form of the
governing equations. A high-order discontinuous Galerkin method is used to
discretize the transformed equation in space and a high-order diagonally
implicit Runge- Kutta scheme is used for the temporal discretization.
Quantities of interest that take the form of space-time integrals are
discretized in a solver-consistent manner. The corresponding fully discrete

  The adjoint method is used to solve two optimal shape and control problems

second optimization problem seeks the energetically optimal flapping motion and

x-directed impulse generated on the airfoil. The optimization solver satisfied
the impulse constraint to greater than 8 digits of accuracy and reduced the
required energy between a factor of 2 and 10, depending on the value of the
impulse constraint, as compared to the nominal configuration.

large sparse linear systems. A hierarchy of progressively coarser grids is
constructed that utilize complementary relaxation and interpolation operators.
High-energy error is reduced by relaxation, while low-energy error is mapped to
coarse-grids and reduced there. However, large parallel communication costs
often limit parallel scalability. As the multigrid hierarchy is formed, each
coarse matrix is formed through a triple matrix product. The resulting
coarse-grids often have significantly more nonzeros per row than the original
fine-grid operator, thereby generating high parallel communication costs on
coarse-levels. In this paper, we introduce a method that systematically removes
entries in coarse-grid matrices after the hierarchy is formed, leading to an
improved communication costs. We sparsify by removing weakly connected or
unimportant entries in the matrix, leading to improved solve time. The main
trade-off is that if the heuristic identifying unimportant entries is used too
aggressively, then AMG convergence can suffer. To counteract this, the original
hierarchy is retained, allowing entries to be reintroduced into the solver
hierarchy if convergence is too slow. This enables a balance between
communication cost and convergence, as necessary. In this paper we present new
algorithms for reducing communication and present a number of computational
experiments in support.

networks including social networks, user-item networks, and the web. Past work
has proposed using Monte Carlo or using linear algebra to estimate scores from
a single source to every target, making them inefficient for a single pair. Our
contribution is a new bidirectional algorithm which combines linear algebra and
Monte Carlo to achieve significant speed improvements. On a diverse set of six
graphs, our algorithm is 70x faster than past state-of-the-art algorithms. We
also present theoretical analysis: while past algorithms require $\Omega(n)$
time to estimate a random walk score of typical size $\frac{1}{n}$ on an
$n$-node graph to a given constant accuracy, our algorithm requires only
$O(\sqrt{m})$ expected time for an average target, where $m$ is the number of
edges, and is provably accurate.

present an alternative algorithm for undirected graphs, a generalization to
arbitrary walk lengths and Markov Chains, an algorithm for personalized search
ranking, and an algorithm for sampling random paths from a given source to a

tunable properties from original 2-dimensional sheet by tailoring. In present
work, the extreme reduction of the thermal conductivity by tailoring sizes in
graphene nanoribbon kirigami (GNR-k) is demonstrated using nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the thermal conductivity
of GNR-k (around 5.1 Wm-1K-1) is about two orders of magnitude lower than that
of the pristine graphene nanoribbon (GNR) (around 151.6 Wm-1K-1), while the
minimum value is expected to be approaching zero in extreme case from our
theoretical model. To explore the origin of the reduction of the thermal
conductivity, the micro-heat flux on each atoms of GNR-k has been further
studied. The results attribute the reduction of the thermal conductivity to
three main sources as: the elongation of real heat flux path, the
overestimation of real heat flux area and the phonon scattering at the vacancy
of the edge. Moreover, the strain engineering effect on the thermal
conductivity of GNR-k and a thermal robustness property has been investigated.
Our results provide physical insights into the origins of the ultralow and
robust thermal conductivity of GNR-k, which also suggests that the GNR-k can be
used for nanaoscale heat management and thermoelectric application.

imaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal coils are
commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias
field) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of
bias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different
image analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to
increased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction
approaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared
to the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and
anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective
bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that
can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a
unified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias
field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated,
bias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel
stochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model
to mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR
data. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR
data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using
endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that
the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to
other tested bias correction methods. As such, the proposed NCBC method may
have potential as a useful retrospective approach for improving the consistency
of image interpretations.

3-manifolds: They are implemented in mathematical software, and allow practical
computations. The invariants can be computed purely combinatorially by
enumerating colourings on the edges of a triangulation T.
  These edge colourings can be interpreted as embeddings of surfaces in T. We
give a characterisation of how these embedded surfaces intersect with the
tetrahedra of T. This is done by characterising isotopy classes of simple
closed loops in the 3-punctured disk. As a direct result we obtain a new system
of coordinates for edge colourings which allows for simpler definitions of the
tetrahedron weights incorporated in the Turaev-Viro invariants.
  Moreover, building on a detailed analysis of the colourings, as well as
classical work due to Kirby and Melvin, Matveev, and others, we show that
considering a much smaller set of colourings suffices to compute Turaev-Viro
invariants in certain significant cases. This results in a substantial
improvement of running times to compute the invariants, reducing the number of
colourings to consider by a factor of $2^n$. In addition, we present an
algorithm to compute Turaev-Viro invariants of degree four -- a problem known
to be #P-hard -- which capitalises on the combinatorial structure of the input.
  The improved algorithms are shown to be optimal in the following sense: There
exist triangulations admitting all colourings the algorithms consider.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our new algorithms to compute Turaev-Viro
invariants are able to distinguish the majority of $\mathbb{Z}$-homology
spheres with complexity up to $11$ in $O(2^n)$ operations in $\mathbb{Q}$.

that the timing and brightness of the new image are consistent with the blind
predictions of a fraction of the models. The reappearance illustrates the
discriminatory power of this blind test and its utility to uncover sources of
systematic uncertainty. From planned HST photometry, we expect to reach a

components; namely, a kernel design algorithm to generate a set of candidate
kernel models, and a model selection criterion to select the simplest kernel
model from the candidate models that provides a sufficiently good fit to the
target image. We restricted our attention to the case of solving for a
spatially-invariant convolution kernel composed of delta basis functions, and
we considered 19 different kernel solution methods including six employing
kernel regularisation. We tested these kernel solution methods by performing a
comprehensive set of image simulations and investigating how their performance
in terms of model error, fit quality, and photometric accuracy depends on the
properties of the reference and target images. We find that the irregular
kernel design algorithm employing unregularised delta basis functions, combined
with either the Akaike or Takeuchi information criterion, is the best kernel
solution method in terms of photometric accuracy. Our results are validated by
tests performed on two independent sets of real data. Finally, we provide some
important recommendations for software implementations of difference image
analysis.

two-dimensional chiral superfluids with pairing symmetry $(p_x+ip_y)^\nu$
depends on the winding number $\nu$ in a striking manner. The ground state
value for the $\nu=1$ case is $L_z=\hbar N/2$ as expected by counting the
Cooper pairs, while a dramatic cancellation takes place for $\nu>1$. The origin
of the cancellation is associated with the topological edge states that appear
in a finite geometry and give rise to a spectral asymmetry. Here we study the
reduction of orbital angular momentum for different potential profiles and
pairing strengths, showing that the result $L_z=\hbar N/2$ is robust for
$\nu=1$ under all studied circumstances. We study how angular momentum depends
on the gap size $\Delta/E_F$ and obtain the result $L_z=\frac{\hbar\nu}{2}
N(1-\frac{\mu}{E_F})$ for $\nu=2,3$. Thus, the gap-dependence of $L_z$ for
$\nu<4$ enters at most through the chemical potential while $\nu\geq4$ is
qualitatively different. In addition, we generalize the spectral asymmetry
arguments to \emph{total} angular momentum in the ground state of triplet
superfluids where due to a spin-orbit coupling $L_z$ is not a good quantum
number. We find that the ground state total angular momentum also behaves very
differently depending on total angular momentum of the Cooper pairs.

has been under extensive investigation. It was recently shown that for convex
problems the classical cyclic BCGD (block coordinate gradient descent) achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(1/r)$ complexity ($r$ is the number of passes of all blocks).
However, such bounds are at least linearly depend on $K$ (the number of
variable blocks), and are at least $K$ times worse than those of the gradient
descent (GD) and proximal gradient (PG) methods. In this paper, we aim to close
such theoretical performance gap between cyclic BCD and GD/PG. First we show
that for a family of quadratic nonsmooth problems, the complexity bounds for
cyclic Block Coordinate Proximal Gradient (BCPG), a popular variant of BCD, can
match those of the GD/PG in terms of dependency on $K$ (up to a $\log^2(K)$
factor). For the same family of problems, we also improve the bounds of the
classical BCD (with exact block minimization) by an order of $K$. Second, we
establish an improved complexity bound of Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) for
general convex problems which can match that of GD in certain scenarios. Our
bounds are sharper than the known bounds as they are always at least $K$ times
worse than GD. Our analyses do not depend on the update order of block
variables inside each cycle, thus our results also apply to BCD methods with
random permutation (random sampling without replacement, another popular
variant).

Stoner instability towards an incommensurate spin-density-wave order with a
wave vector equal to the thickness of the Fermi sea. The instability occurs at
a critical interaction strength which goes down with the density of the
fermions. We find that the instability survives interaction renormalization due
to vertex corrections and discuss how this can be seen in experiments. We also
track the renormalization group flows of the different couplings between the
fermionic degrees of freedom, and find that there are no perturbative
instabilities, and that Stoner instability is the strongest instability which
occurs at a critical threshold value of the interaction. The critical
interaction goes to zero as the chemical potential is tuned towards the band
bottom.

model that couples a description of bacteria as individual discrete objects to
the standard advection-diffusion equations for the environment. The model takes
into account two different bacterial phenotypes. In the motile state, bacteria
swim and perform a run-and-tumble motion that is biased toward regions of high
oxygen concentration (aerotaxis). In the matrix-producer state they excrete
extracellular polymers, which allows them to connect to other bacteria and to
form a biofilm. Bacteria are also advected by the fluid, and can trigger
bioconvection. Numerical simulations of the model reproduce all the stages of
biofilm formation observed in laboratory experiments. Finally, we study the
influence of various model parameters on the dynamics and morphology of

posterior probability. Topics are tracked to deal with the continuously updated

the prominence are strongly absorbing structures which look like they are
rotating, or oscillating in the plane of the sky. The two prominence legs,
which are both very bright in Ca II (SOT), are not visible in the IRIS Mg II

structures in Mg II which leads to reversed profiles, and hence to lower
integrated intensities at these locations than in the surroundings. Using lines
formed at temperatures lower than 1 MK, we measure relatively low Doppler
shifts on the order of +/- 10 km/s in the tornado-like structure. Between the
two legs we see loops in Mg II, with material flowing from one leg to the

estimates the population mean and the population covariance matrix even when

corruption matrix is provably rate optimal simultaneously for the entry-wise
$\ell_1$-norm, the Frobenius norm and the mixed $\ell_2/\ell_1$ norm.
Furthermore, this optimality is achieved by a penalized
square-root-of-least-squares method with a universal tuning parameter
(calibrating the strength of the penalization). These results are partly
extended to the case where $p$ is potentially larger than $n$, under the
additional condition that the inverse covariance matrix is sparse.

of both hydrogen and helium. The simulation includes the effect of hydrogen
Lyman-$\alpha$ and the EUV radiation from the corona on the ionization and
heating of the atmosphere. Details on code implementation are given. We obtain
helium ion fractions that are far from their equilibrium values. Comparison
with models with LTE ionization shows that non-equilibrium helium ionization
leads to higher temperatures in wave fronts and lower temperatures in the gas
between shocks. Assuming LTE ionization results in a thermostat-like behaviour
with matter accumulating around the temperatures where the LTE ionization
fractions change rapidly. Comparison of DEM curves computed from our models
shows that non-equilibrium ionization leads to more radiating material in the
temperature range 11-18 kK compared to models with LTE helium ionization. We
conclude that non-equilbrium helium ionization is important for the dynamics

arbitrage-free multivariate model characterized by transparency on the
dependence structure, since closed form formulae for terminal correlations,
average correlations and copula function are available. It also allows for
complete decorrelation between assets and instantaneous variances. Each single
asset is modelled according to a lognormal mixture dynamics model, and this
univariate version is widely used in the industry due to its flexibility and
accuracy. The same property holds for the multivariate process of all assets,
whose density is a mixture of multivariate basic densities. This allows for
consistency of single asset and index/portfolio smile. In this paper, we
generalize the MVMD model by introducing shifted dynamics and we propose a
definition of implied correlation under this model. We investigate whether the
model is able to consistently reproduce the implied volatility of FX cross
rates once the single components are calibrated to univariate shifted lognormal
mixture dynamics models. We consider in particular the case of the Chinese
renminbi FX rate, showing that the shifted MVMD model correctly recovers the
CNY/EUR smile given the EUR/USD smile and the USD/CNY smile, thus highlighting
that the model can also work as an arbitrage free volatility smile
extrapolation tool for cross currencies that may not be liquid or fully
observable. We compare the performance of the shifted MVMD model in terms of
implied correlation with those of the shifted Simply Correlated Mixture
Dynamics model where the dynamics of the single assets are connected naively by
introducing correlation among their Brownian motions. Finally, we introduce a

behavior in Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots based on cold field electron emission
(CFE) experimental data. It is characterized by a clear change in the decay
rate of usually single-slope FN plots, and has been reported when non-uniform
nano-emitters are subject to high macroscopic electric field $F_M$. We assume
that the number of emitting spots, which defines an apparent formal area
efficiency of CFE surfaces, depends on the macroscopic electric field.
Non-uniformity is described by local enhancement factors
$\left\{\gamma_j\right\}$, which are randomly assigned to each distinct emitter
of a conducting CFE surface, from a discrete probability distribution
$\rho{(\gamma_{j})}$, with $j=1,2$. It is assumed that $\rho{(\gamma_{1})} <
\rho{(\gamma_{2})}$, and that $\gamma_{1} > \gamma_{2}$. The local current
density is evaluated by considering a usual Schottky-Nordheim barrier. The
results reproduce the two distinct slope regimes in FN plots when $F_M \in $
$[2,20]$ V/$\mu$m and are analyzed by taking into account the apparent formal
area efficiency, the distribution $\rho$, and the slopes in the corresponding
FN plot. Finally, we remark that our results from numerical solution of
Laplace's equation, for an array of conducting nano-emitters with uniform apex
radii $50$ nm but different local height, supports our theoretical assumptions
and could used in orthodox CFE experiments to test our predictions.

found that a vortex in a superfluid film creates an electric potential above

have historically not been seen as a serious security problem. That threat is
routinely thwarted by having invigilators ensure that candidates do not
misbehave during testing. However, as recent exam scandals confirm, also
invigilators and exam authorities may have interest in frauds, hence they may
pose security threats as well. Moreover, new security issues arise from the
recent use of computers, which can facilitate the exam experience for example
by allowing candidates to register from home. Thus, exams must be designed with
the care normally devoted to security protocols.
  This dissertation studies exam protocol security and provides an in-depth
understanding that can be also useful for the study of the security of similar
systems, such as personnel selections, project reviews, and conference
management systems. It introduces an unambiguous terminology that leads to the
specification of a taxonomy of various exam types, depending on the level of
computer assistance. It then establishes a theoretical framework for the formal
analysis of exams. The framework defines several authentication, privacy, and
verifiability requirements that modern exams should meet, and enables the
security of exam protocols to be studied. Using the framework, we formally
analyse traditional, computer-assisted, and Internet-based exam protocols. We
find some security issues and propose modifications to partially achieve the
desired requirements.
  This dissertation also designs three novel exam protocols that guarantee a
wide set of security requirements.
  Finally, this dissertation looks at exams as carried out through modern
browsers. We advance a formal analysis of requirements that are not only
logically conditioned on the technology but also on user actions. We conclude
with best-practice recommendations to browser vendors.

due to the Pauli exclusion for the low energy $s$-wave scattering. We treat
fermions as a gas of polarons dressed with Bogoliubov phonons, which is an

information (CSI). The key observation is that network power minimization can
be achieved by adaptively selecting active remote radio heads (RRHs) via
controlling the group-sparsity structure of the beamforming vector. However,
this yields a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, for which we
propose a three-stage robust group sparse beamforming algorithm. In the first
stage, a quadratic variational formulation of the weighted mixed l1/l2-norm is
proposed to induce the group-sparsity structure in the aggregated beamforming
vector, which indicates those RRHs that can be switched off. A perturbed
alternating optimization algorithm is then proposed to solve the resultant
non-convex group-sparsity inducing optimization problem by exploiting its
convex substructures. In the second stage, we propose a PhaseLift technique
based algorithm to solve the feasibility problem with a given active RRH set,
which helps determine the active RRHs. Finally, the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique is adopted to determine the robust multicast beamformers.
Simulation results will demonstrate the convergence of the perturbed
alternating optimization algorithm, as well as, the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm to minimize the network power consumption for multicast
Cloud-RAN.

pool, centralized signal processing and resource allocation are enabled in
Cloud-RAN, thereby providing the promise of improving the energy efficiency via
effective network adaptation and interference management. In this paper, we
propose a holistic sparse optimization framework to design green Cloud-RAN by
taking into consideration the power consumption of the fronthaul links,
multicast services, as well as user admission control. Specifically, we first
identify the sparsity structures in the solutions of both the network power
minimization and user admission control problems. However, finding the optimal
sparsity structures turns out to be NP-hard, with the coupled challenges of the
l0-norm based objective functions and the nonconvex quadratic QoS constraints
due to multicast beamforming. In contrast to the previous works on convex but
non-smooth sparsity inducing approaches, e.g., the group sparse beamforming
algorithm based on the mixed l1/l2-norm relaxation [1], we adopt the nonconvex
but smoothed lp-minimization (0 < p <= 1) approach to promote sparsity in the
multicast setting, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the
principle of the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm and the semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) technique. In particular, an iterative reweighted-l2 algorithm
is developed, which will converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the
relaxed smoothed lp-minimization problem from the SDR technique. We illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with extensive simulations for
network power minimization and user admission control in multicast Cloud-RAN.

issue of primordial cosmological perturbations in detail. As we demonstrate,
for the singular bounce, the primordial perturbations originating from the
cosmological era near the bounce, do not produce a scale invariant spectrum and
also the short wavelength modes, after these exit the horizon, do not freeze,
but grow linearly with time. After presenting the cosmological perturbations
study, we discuss the viability of the singular bounce model, and our results
indicate that the singular bounce must be combined with another cosmological
scenario, or should be modified appropriately, in order that it leads to a
viable cosmology. The study of the slow-roll parameters leads to the same
result, indicating the singular bounce theory is unstable at the singularity
point, for certain values of the parameters. We also conformally transform the

that is getting increasingly more attention over the past couple of years.
Beams with a well defined OAM, the so-called vortex beams, are applied already
in e.g. telecommunication, astrophysics, nanomanipulation and chiral
measurements in optics and electron microscopy. Also the OAM of a wave induced
by the interaction with a sample, shows great potential of interest. In all
these experiments it is crucial to measure the exact (local) OAM content of the
wave, whether it is an incoming vortex beam or an exit wave after interacting
with a sample. In this work we investigate the use of spiral phase plates as an
alternative to the programmable phase plates used in optics to measure OAM. We
derive analytically how these can be used to study the local OAM components of
any wave function. By means of numerical simulations we illustrate how the OAM
of a pure vortex beam can be measured. We also look at a sum of misaligned
vortex beams and show how using SPPs the position and the OAM of each
individual beam can be detected. Finally we look at the OAM induced by a
magnetic dipole on a free electron wave and show how the SPP can be used to
localize the magnetic poles and measure their ""magnetic charge"".
  Although our findings can be applied to study the OAM of any wave function,
they are of particular interest for electron microscopy where versatile
programmable phase plates do not yet exist.

systems are investigated in a five hopping parameter tight-binding model, using
analytical and numerical techniques. The main emphasis is on the properties of
the topological edge states accommodated by the quasi-flat band that
characterizes the phosphorene energy spectrum. We show, in the particular case
of phosphorene, how the breaking of the bipartite lattice structure gives rise
to the electron-hole asymmetry of the energy spectrum. The properties of the
topological edge states in the zig-zag nanoribbons are analyzed under different
aspects: degeneracy, localization, extension in the Brillouin zone, dispersion
of the quasi-flat band in magnetic field. The finite-size phosphorene plaquette
exhibits a Hofstadter-type spectrum made up of two unequal butterflies
separated by a gap, where a quasi-flat band composed of zig-zag edge states is
located. The transport properties are investigated by simulating a four-lead
Hall device (importantly, all leads are attached on the same zig-zag side), and
using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. We find out that the chiral edge states
due to the magnetic field yield quantum Hall plateaus, but the topological edge
states in the gap do not support the quantum Hall effect and prove a
dissipative behavior. By calculating the complex eigenenergies of the
non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that describes the open system
(plaquette+leads), we prove the superradiance effect in the energy range of the
quasi-flat band, with consequences for the density of states and electron
transmission properties.

introducing magnetic dopants. Alternatively, in an ultra-thin slab with
thickness on the order of the extent of the surface states, both the top and
bottom surface states acquire a common gap value ($\Delta$) but with opposite
sign. In a topological insulator, the dominant piece of the Hamiltonian
($\hat{H}$) is of a relativistic nature. A subdominant non-relativistic piece
is also present and in an external magnetic field ($B$) applied perpendicular
to the surface, the $N=0$ Landau level is no longer at zero energy but is
shifted to positive energy by the Schr{\""o}dinger magnetic energy. When a gap
is present, it further shifts this level down by $-\Delta$ for positive
$\Delta$ and up by $|\Delta|$ for a negative gap. This has important
consequences for the magneto-optical properties of such systems. In particular,
at charge neutrality, the lowest energy transition displays anomalous
non-monotonic behaviour as a function of $B$ in both its position in energy and
its optical spectral weight. The gap can also have a profound impact on the

undergoes a metallic transition, while half-metallicity in CoFeCrGe is retained
for a limited range. Antisite disorder between Co-Al pairs in CoMnCrAl and
Co-Ge pairs in CoFeCrGe is energetically the most favored, and retain
half-metallic character in Co-excess samples. However, Co-deficient samples
undergo a transition from half-metallic to metallic, with a discontinuity in
the saturation magnetization. For binary swaps, configurations that compete
with the ground state are identified and show no loss of half-metallicity;
however, the minority-spin bandgap and magnetic moments vary depending on the
atoms swapped. For single binary swaps, there is a significant energy cost in
CoMnCrAl but with no loss of half metallicity. Although a few configurations in
CoFeCrGe energetically compete with the ground statei, however the

rapidly transfer the excitation energy to the photochemical reaction centre.

  Testing: A Controlled Experiment","27 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Search-based software testing promises to provide users with the
ability to generate high-quality test cases, and hence increase product
quality, with a minimal increase in the time and effort required. One result
that emerged out of a previous study to investigate the application of
search-based software testing (SBST) in an industrial setting was the
development of the Interactive Search-Based Software Testing (ISBST) system.
ISBST allows users to interact with the underlying SBST system, guiding the
search and assessing the results. An industrial evaluation indicated that the
ISBST system could find test cases that are not created by testers employing
manual techniques. The validity of the evaluation was threatened, however, by
the low number of participants.
  Objective: This paper presents a follow-up study, to provide a more rigorous
evaluation of the ISBST system.
  Method: To assess the ISBST system a two-way crossover controlled experiment
was conducted with 58 students taking a Verification and Validation course. The
NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is used to assess the workload experienced by
the participants in the experiment.
  Results: The experimental results validated the hypothesis that the ISBST
system generates test cases that are not found by the same participants
employing manual testing techniques. A follow-up laboratory experiment also
investigates the importance of interaction in obtaining the results. In
addition to this main result, the subjective workload was assessed for each
participant by means of the NASA-TLX tool. The evaluation showed that, while
the ISBST system required more effort from the participants, they achieved the
same performance.
  Conclusions: The paper provides evidence that the ISBST system develops test
cases that are not found by manual techniques, and that interaction plays an
important role in achieving that result.

bound. There is evidence that molecular outflows transport large quantities of
momentum and energy. Outflow energies are at least 20 per cent of the total
turbulent kinetic energies in all of the regions studied and greater than the
turbulent energy in half of the regions. However, we find no evidence that
outflows increase levels of turbulence, and there is no correlation between the
outflow and turbulent energies. Even though outflows in some regions contribute
significantly to maintaining turbulence levels against dissipation, this relies
on outflows efficiently coupling to bulk motions. Other mechanisms (e.g.
supernovae) must be the main drivers of turbulence in most if not all of these
regions.

over a ring network with stochastic switching of links at every time step is
reported in this paper. It is observed that spatiotemporal synchronization
never appears for nearest neighbor connections; however, stochastic switching
of connections with homogeneous delay $(\tau)$ is capable of synchronizing the
network to homogeneous steady state or periodic orbit or synchronized
chaotically oscillating state depending on the delay parameter, stochasticity
parameter and map parameters. Linear stability analysis of the synchronized
state is done analytically for unit delay and the value of the critical
coupling strength, at which the onset of synchronization occurs is determined
analytically. The logistic map $rx(1-x)$ (a smooth unimodal map) is chosen for
numerical simulation purpose. Synchronized steady state or synchronized
period-2 orbit is stabilized for delay $\tau=1$. On the other hand for delay
$\tau=2$ the network is stabilized to the fixed point of the local map.
Numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the analytically
obtained linear stability analysis results. Another interesting observation is
the existence of synchronized chaos in the network for delay $\tau>2$.
Calculating synchronization error and plotting time series data and Poincare
first return map the existence of synchronized chaos is confirmed. The results
hold good for other smooth unimodal maps also.

which do not appear to have been fully explored in the literature. In
particular, implications of recent evidences of heating of the intergalactic
medium (IGM) by feedback from active galactic nuclei are investigated. Taking
also into account the IGM heating associated to structure formation, we argue
that values of the y parameter of several*10^(-6), i.e. a factor of a few below
the COBE/FIRAS upper limit, are to be expected. The Compton scattering by the
re-ionized plasma also re-processes primordial distortions, adding a y-type
contribution. Hence no pure Bose-Einstein-like distortions are to be expected.
An assessment of Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, taking into account
the latest results from the Planck satellite as well as the contributions from
the strong CII and CO lines from star-forming galaxies, demonstrates that a
foreground subtraction accurate enough to fully exploit the PIXIE sensitivity
will be extremely challenging. Motivated by this fact we also discuss methods
to detect spectral distortions not requiring absolute measurements and show
that accurate determinations of the frequency spectrum of the CMB dipole
amplitude may substantially improve over COBE/FIRAS limits on distortion
parameters. Such improvements may be at reach of next generation CMB anisotropy
experiments. The estimated amplitude of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB)
dipole might be detectable by careful analyses of Planck maps at the highest
frequencies. Thus Planck might provide interesting constraints on the CIB

into query answering algorithms that meet this standard. Algorithms are
becoming increasingly complex, and in particular, the performance of many
emerging algorithms is {\em data dependent}, meaning the distribution of the
noise added to query answers may change depending on the input data.
Theoretical analysis typically only considers the worst case, making empirical
study of average case performance increasingly important.
  In this paper we propose a set of evaluation principles which we argue are
essential for sound evaluation. Based on these principles we propose DPBench, a
novel evaluation framework for standardized evaluation of privacy algorithms.
We then apply our benchmark to evaluate algorithms for answering 1- and
2-dimensional range queries. The result is a thorough empirical study of 15
published algorithms on a total of 27 datasets that offers new insights into
algorithm behavior---in particular the influence of dataset scale and
shape---and a more complete characterization of the state of the art. Our
methodology is able to resolve inconsistencies in prior empirical studies and
place algorithm performance in context through comparison to simple baselines.
Finally, we pose open research questions which we hope will guide future
algorithm design.

relies on the use of blocking cones in the {\em field reduced} representation

blocking sets. This construction is inspired by the construction for minimal
blocking sets with respect to the hyperplanes by Mazzocca, Polverino and Storme
({\em the MPS-construction}); we show that for a suitable choice of the
blocking cone over a planar blocking set, we obtain larger blocking sets than
the ones obtained from planar blocking sets in \cite{pol}.

reduction to a minimal blocking set with respect to $(nt-t-1)$-spaces in

formation on the large-scale expansion of the universe. We take a bottom-up
approach to cosmological modelling by splitting our universe into cells. The
matter content within each cell is described by the post-Newtonian formalism.
We assume that most of the cell is in the vicinity of weak gravitational
fields, so that it can be described using a perturbed Minkowski metric. Our
cells are patched together using the Israel junction conditions. We impose
reflection symmetry across the boundary of these cells. This allows us to
calculate the equation of motion for the boundary of the cell and, hence, the
expansion rate of the universe. At Newtonian order, we recover the standard
Friedmann-like equations. At post-Newtonian orders, we obtain a correction to
the large-scale expansion of the universe. Our framework does not depend on the
process of averaging in cosmology. As an example, we use this framework to
investigate the cosmological evolution of a large number of regularly arranged
point-like masses. At Newtonian order, the Friedmann-like equations take the
form of dust and spatial curvature. At post-Newtonian orders, we get
corrections to the dust term and we get an additional term that takes the same
form as radiation. The radiation-like term is a result of the non-linearity of
Einstein's equations, and is due to the inhomogeneity present in our model.

NuSTAR, and by examining optical and radio data from HST and VLA. Our X-ray
spectral analysis shows that the source has a hard power-law spectral shape
with a photon index Gamma~1.5, which persists despite the source's X-ray
luminosity varying by over an order of magnitude. The power spectrum of the

found in the power spectra of low/hard state black holes (BHs). We can take a

minimizing the expected loss under the resulting transfer model. For linear
classifiers and a large family of loss functions and transfer models, this
expected loss can be computed or approximated analytically, and minimized
efficiently. Our empirical evaluation of FLDA focuses on problems comprising
binary and count data in which the transfer can be naturally modeled via a
dropout distribution, which allows the classifier to adapt to differences in
the marginal probability of features in the source and the target domain. Our
experiments on several real-world problems show that FLDA performs on par with
state-of-the-art domain-adaptation techniques.

power ratio. However, aside from these explicit parameters, the Shannon-Hartley
law also rests on certain assumptions. One of these is that the channel is
linear: recent work has shown that nonlinear channels are not limited by the
Shannon upper bound. A second assumption, arising from the mathematical tools

expectation-maximization (SAEM) algorithm to maximize the likelihood function
with the novelty of using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) within SAEM.
The task is to provide each iteration of SAEM with a filtered state of the
system, and this is achieved using an ABC sampler for the hidden state, based
on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methodology. It is shown that the resulting
SAEM-ABC algorithm can be calibrated to return accurate inference, and in some
situations it can outperform a version of SAEM incorporating the bootstrap
filter. Two simulation studies are presented, first a nonlinear Gaussian
state-space model then a state-space model having dynamics expressed by a
stochastic differential equation. Comparisons with iterated filtering for
maximum likelihood inference, and Gibbs sampling and particle marginal methods
for Bayesian inference are presented.

complicated physical scenarios -- any number of observers choosing between any
number of observables with any number of possible outcomes -- is currently an
open problem. Here I provide a new set of tools, which I refer to as
""multideviations"", for finding and analyzing these inequalities for the fully
general case. In Part I, I introduce the multideviation framework and then use
it to prove an important theorem: the Bell distributions can be generated from
the set of joint distributions over all observables by deeming specific degrees
of freedom unobservable. In Part II, I show how the theorem provides a new
method for finding tight Bell inequalities. I then specify a set of new tight
Bell inequalities for arbitrary event spaces -- the ""even/odd"" inequalities --
which have a straightforward interpretation when expressed in terms of
multideviations. The even/odd inequalities concern degrees of freedom that are
independent of those involved in parameter independence, raising the
possibility of a new Bell's theorem with stronger philosophical implications.
Also, contrary to expectations, the violation of the inequalities by quantum
mechanics increases in size with the number of systems.

also called as pseudofractal scale-free web (PSFW), and analyze the
volatilities of first passage time (FPT) and first return time (FRT) by using
the variance and the reduced moment as the measures. Note that the FRT and FPT
are deeply affected by the starting or target site. We don't intend to
enumerate all the possible cases and analyze them. We only study the
volatilities of FRT for a given hub (i.e., node with highest degree) and the
volatilities of the global FPT (GFPT) to a given hub, which is the average of
the FPTs for arriving at a given hub from any possible starting site selected
randomly according to the equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain.
Firstly, we calculate exactly the probability generating function of the GFPT
and FRT based on the self-similar structure of the PSFW. Then, we calculate the
probability distribution, the mean, the variance and reduced moment of the GFPT
and FRT by using the generating functions as a tool. Results show that: the
reduced moment of FRT grows with the increasing of the network order $N$ and
tends to infinity while $N\rightarrow\infty$; but for the reduced moments of
GFPT, it is almost a constant($\approx1.1605$) for large $N$. Therefore, on the
PSFW of large size, the FRT has huge fluctuations and the estimate provided by
MFRT is unreliable, whereas the fluctuations of the GFPT is much smaller and
the estimate provided by its mean is more reliable. The method we propose can
also be used to analyze the volatilities of FPT and FRT on other networks with
self-similar structure, such as $(u, v)$ flowers and recursive scale-free
trees.

strong multiple scattering between scatterers, we give a non-iterative
formulation to find the locations and reflectivities of the scatterers from a
nonlinear inverse problem in two steps, using either single or multiple
illuminations. We further introduce an approach that uses the top singular
vectors of the response matrix as optimal illuminations, which improves the
robustness of sparse promoting optimization with respect to additive noise.
When multiple scattering is negligible, the optimization problem becomes linear
and can be reduced to a hybrid-$\ell_1$ method when optimal illuminations are
used. When the media is random, and the interaction with the unknown
inhomogeneities can be primarily modeled by wavefront distortions, we address
the statistical stability of these methods. We analyze the fluctuations of the
images obtained with the hybrid-$\ell_1$ method, and we show that it is stable
with respect to different realizations of the random medium provided the
imaging array is large enough. We compare the performance of the
hybrid-$\ell_1$ method in random media to the widely used Kirchhoff migration

categories, namely, globular proteins (spheroproteins), and elongated or
rod-shaped proteins (RSP). The former comprises a significant majority of
proteins. This work concerns the second category. Unlike a spheroprotein, an
RSP possesses a conspicuous axis along its longest dimension. To take advantage
of this symmetry element, we decided to represent RSPs using cylindrical
coordinates, (rho, theta, z), with the z-axis as the main axis, and one tip of
the protein at the origin. A ""tip"" is one of two extreme points in the protein
lying along the protein axis along its longest dimension. We first identify the
two tips, T1 and T2, of the RSP using a protein graphics software, then
determine their (Cartesian) coordinates, (h, k, l) and (m, n, o), respectively.
Arbitrarily selecting T1 as the tip at the origin, we translate the protein by
subtracting (h, k, l) from all structural coordinates. We then find the angle
alpha between vector T1-T2 and the positive z-axis by computing the scalar
product of vectors T1- T2 and OP where P is an arbitrary point along the
positive z-axis. We typically use (0, 0, p) where p is a suitable positive
number. Then we compute the cross product of the two vectors to determine the
axis about which we should rotate vector T1-T2 to make it coincide with the
positive z-axis. We use a matrix form of Rodrigues' formula to do the rotation.
We then apply the Cartesian to cylindrical coordinate transformation equations
to the system. We have applied the above transformation to 15 RSPs: 1QCE, 2JJ7,

the ""secant plane"" (SP) and ""tangent sphere"" (TS) methods. The protein
molecular centroid (global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid,
LC) are first determined. The SP is the plane passing through the LC and normal
to the line passing through the LC and the GC. The ""exterior side"" of the SP is
the side opposite GC. The TS is the sphere with center at GC and tangent to the
SP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms inside the TS (TS index) and on the
exterior side of the SP (SP index), are complementary measures of LBS depth.
The SPi is directly proportional to LBS depth while the TSi is inversely
proportional. We tested the two methods using a test set of 67
well-characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski, et al. 1996), as well
as that of an artificial protein in the form of a grid of points in the overall
shape of a sphere and in which LBS of any depth can be specified. Results from
both the SP and TS methods agree well with reported data (ibid.), and results
from the artificial case confirm that both methods are suitable measures of LBS
depth. The web server may be used in two modes. In the ""ligand mode"", user
inputs the protein PDB coordinates as well as those of the ligand. The ""LBS
mode"" is the same as the former, except that the ligand coordinates are assumed
to be unavailable; hence the user inputs what s/he believes to be the
coordinates of the LBS amino acid residues. In both cases, the web server
outputs the SP and TS indices. LBS depth is usually directly related to the
amount of conformational change a protein undergoes upon ligand binding -
ability to quantify it could allows meaningful comparison of protein
flexibility and dynamics. The URL of our web server will be announced publicly

study different bound conformations of ligands it is found that they share a
specific three- dimensional pattern that is more or less common and is
responsible for its binding and which is complementary in three-dimensional
geometry and charge distribution pattern with its cognate binding site in the

opinions of its neighbors in a non-linear manner. This allows for voting rules
different from majority voting. While the linear voter model is known to reach
consensus, non-linear voter models can result in the coexistence of opposite
opinions. Our aim is to derive approximations to correctly predict the time
dependent dynamics, or at least the asymptotic outcome, of such local
interactions. Emphasis is on a probabilistic approach to decompose the opinion
distribution in a second-order neighborhood into lower-order probability
distributions. This is compared with an analytic pair approximation for the
expected value of the global fraction of opinions and a mean-field
approximation. Our reference case are averaged stochastic simulations of a
one-dimensional cellular automaton. We find that the probabilistic second-order
approach captures the dynamics of the reference case very well for different
non-linearities, i.e for both majority and minority voting rules, which only
partly holds for the first-order pair approximation and not at all for the
mean-field approximation. We further discuss the interesting phenomenon of a
correlated coexistence, characterized by the formation of large domains of
opinions that dominate for some time, but slowly change.

  for understanding past and future economic growth",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a quantitative characterisation of the fluctuations of the
annualized growth rate of the real US GDP per capita growth at many scales,
using a wavelet transform analysis of two data sets, quarterly data from 1947
to 2015 and annual data from 1800 to 2010. Our main finding is that the
distribution of GDP growth rates can be well approximated by a bimodal function
associated to a series of switches between regimes of strong growth rate
$\rho_\text{high}$ and regimes of low growth rate $\rho_\text{low}$. The
succession of such two regimes compounds to produce a remarkably stable long
term average real annualized growth rate of 1.6\% from 1800 to 2010 and
$\approx 2.0\%$ since 1950, which is the result of a subtle compensation
between the high and low growth regimes that alternate continuously. Thus, the
overall growth dynamics of the US economy is punctuated, with phases of strong
growth that are intrinsically unsustainable, followed by corrections or
consolidation until the next boom starts. We interpret these findings within
the theory of ""social bubbles"" and argue as a consequence that estimations of
the cost of the 2008 crisis may be misleading. We also interpret the absence of
strong recovery since 2008 as a protracted low growth regime $\rho_\text{low}$
associated with the exceptional nature of the preceding large growth regime.
