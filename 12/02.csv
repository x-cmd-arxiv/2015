  Interaction Type",,,,,"stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The understanding of the type of inhibitory interaction plays an important
role in drug design. Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a
drug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein
targets.
  Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method
Macau which allows us to combine different measurement types into a single
tensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by
high dimensional 2D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is
that using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate
high dimensional side information, i.e., millions of unique 2D ECFP compound
features, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the
side information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically
futile.
  Results: using public IC50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from
where we can identify the latent subspace separating the two measurement types
(IC50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the
competitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins.

a general dual scenario, in which the epidemic transition is either ruled by a
hub activation process, leading to a null threshold in the thermodynamic limit,
or given by a collective activation process, corresponding to a standard phase
transition with a finite threshold. We validate the proposed criterion applying
it to different epidemic models, with waning immunity or heterogeneous
infection rates in both synthetic and real SF networks. In particular, a waning
immunity, irrespective of its strength, leads to collective activation with
finite threshold in scale-free networks with large exponent, at odds with
canonical theoretical approaches.

conducted a survey using the first sky pass of NEOWISE data and the AllWISE
catalog to identify nearby stars and brown dwarfs with large proper motions
($\mu_{\rm total}$ $\gtrsim$ 250 mas yr$^{-1}$). A total of 20,548 high proper

has uncovered a significantly larger sample of fainter objects (W2 $\gtrsim$13
mag) than the previous WISE motion surveys of Luhman (2014a) and Kirkpatrick et
al. (2014). Many of these objects are predicted to be new L and T dwarfs based
on near- and mid-infrared colors. Using estimated spectral types along with
distance estimates, we have identified several objects likely belonging to the
nearby Solar neighborhood (d $<$ 25 pc). We have followed up 19 of these new
discoveries with near-infrared or optical spectroscopy, focusing on potentially
nearby objects, objects with the latest predicted spectral types, and potential
late-type subdwarfs. This subset includes 6 M dwarfs, 5 of which are likely
subdwarfs, as well as 8 L dwarfs and 5 T dwarfs, many of which have blue
near-infrared colors. As an additional supplement, we provide 2MASS and AllWISE
positions and photometry for every object found in our search, as well as

processes often relies on the assumption of constant process parameters.
However, it is a well-known problem that the parameters of empirical spike
trains can be highly variable, such as for example the firing rate. In order to
test the null hypothesis of a constant rate and to estimate the change points,
a Multiple Filter Test (MFT) and a corresponding algorithm (MFA) have been
proposed that can be applied under the assumption of independent inter spike
intervals (ISIs).
  As empirical spike trains often show weak dependencies in the correlation
structure of ISIs, we extend the MFT here to point processes associated with
short range dependencies. By specifically estimating serial dependencies in the
test statistic, we show that the new MFT can be applied to a variety of
empirical firing patterns, including positive and negative serial correlations
as well as tonic and bursty firing. The new MFT is applied to a data set of
empirical spike trains with serial correlations, and simulations show improved
performance against methods that assume independence. In case of positive
correlations, our new MFT is necessary to reduce the number of false positives,
which can be highly enhanced when falsely assuming independence. For the
frequent case of negative correlations, the new MFT shows an improved detection
probability of change points and thus, also a higher potential of signal
extraction from noisy spike trains.

associations. The observed stellar groups display a broad spectrum of masses,
sizes and other properties, so it is often assumed that there is no underlying
structure in this diversity. Here we show that the assumption of an
unstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.
Current data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,
size, age, maximum stellar mass etc. In this first paper we take a closer look
at the correlation of cluster mass and radius. We use literature data to
explore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solar
neighborhood. We show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood
there exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius of
the form $M_c = C R_c^{\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. This correlation holds
for infra red K band data as well as X-ray sources and for clusters containing
a hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. The
correlation is difficult to verify for clusters containing <30 stars due to
low-number statistics. Dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embedded
clusters. We find a similar slope for the mass-size relation of dense, massive
clumps as for the embedded star clusters. This might point at a direct
translation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate size
measurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles. Taking into
account multiple paths for clump mass into cluster mass, we obtain an average
star-formation efficiency of 18%{+9.3}{-5.7} for the embedded clusters in the
solar neighborhood. The derived mass-radius relation gives constraints for the
theory of clustered star formation. Analytical models and simulations of
clustered star formation have to reproduce this relation in order to be
realistic (abridged)

study the behavior of glassy states of Hard Spheres in infinite dimensions

in both cases, when the external perturbation is sufficiently strong, glassy
states undergo a second-order transition, called the Gardner transition,
whereupon a hierarchical structure of marginal micro-states manifests within
the original glass state. The purpose of this work is to study the solution of
the state-following construction in this marginal phase. We show that upon
compression, close to the jamming transition, the metastable states are
described by a scaling solution characterized by a set of non-trivial critical
exponents that agree with the results obtained in a preceding work, and we
compute the value of the final jamming density for various glassy states.
Moreover we show that under the action of the shear strain, beyond the Gardner
point, the metastable states can be followed in the marginal phase and we
detect an overshoot in the stress-strain curve in agreement with numerical and
experimental observations. Finally we further characterize the Gardner
transition point by computing both the critical 4-point susceptibility and the
exponents that characterize the critical slowing down of the dynamics within a
glassy state close to the transition.

preventive rewiring. The models are denoted SIR-$\omega$ and SEIR-$\omega$, and
we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive
expression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the expected degree of
the infectious nodes $E(D_I)$ using two different approximation approaches. The
first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching
process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are
compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic
simulations of SIR-$\omega$ and SEIR-$\omega$ epidemics on Poisson and
scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches
predict the same epidemic threshold and the same $E(D_I)$ for both types of
epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from
simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold,
pairwise models overestimate the value of $R_0$ computed from simulations,
which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process
approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with $\alpha > 0$ (perhaps
unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic
thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement

relation can contain cycles. We show that the lines can be cut into
$O(n^{3/2}\mathop{\mathrm{polylog}} n)$ pieces, such that the depth relation
among these pieces is now a proper partial order. This bound is nearly tight in
the worst case.
  Previous results on this topic could only handle restricted cases of the
problem (such as handling only triangular cycles, by Aronov, Koltun, and Sharir
(2005), or only cycles in grid-like patterns, by Chazelle et al. (1992)), and
the bounds were considerably weaker---much closer to the trivial quadratic
bound.
  Our proof uses a recent variant of the polynomial partitioning technique, due
to Guth, and some simple tools from algebraic geometry. It is much more
straightforward than the previous ""purely combinatorial"" methods.
  Our technique can be extended to eliminating all cycles in the depth relation
among segments, and among constant-degree algebraic arcs. We hope that a
suitable extension of this technique could be used to handle the much more
difficult case of pairwise-disjoint triangles.
  We also discuss several algorithms for constructing a small set of cuts so as
to eliminate all depth-relation cycles among the lines (minimizing such a set,
for the case of line segments, is known to be NP-complete). The performance of
these algorithms improves due to our new bound, but, so far, none of them both
(a) produce close to $n^{3/2}$ cuts, and (b) run in time close to $n^{3/2}$, in
the worst case.

motion arises from coupling of the small body's spin to the black hole's

propose its approximate version where mismatches are allowed, due to its
applications in subfields such as computational biology. We design a generic
in-place framework that fits to solve both the exact and approximate
$k$-mismatch SUS finding, using the minimum $2n$ memory words plus $n$ bytes
space, where $n$ is the input string size. By using the in-place framework, we
can find the exact and approximate $k$-mismatch SUS for every string position
using a total of $O(n)$ and $O(n^2)$ time, respectively, regardless of the
value of $k$. Our framework does not involve any compressed or succinct data
structures and thus is practical and easy to implement.

$S_2(x)=\frac 1 2 x +\frac 12$ for all $x\in \mathbb R$. Such a probability
measure $P$ has support the Cantor set generated by $S_1$ and $S_2$. For this
probability measure, in this paper, we give an induction formula to determine
the optimal sets of $n$-means and the $n$th quantization errors for all $n\geq
2$. We have shown that the same induction formula also works for the Cantor
distribution $P:=\psi^2 P\circ S_1^{-1} +\psi^4 P\circ S_2^{-1}$ supported by
the Cantor set generated by $S_1(x)=\frac 13x$ and $S_2(x)=\frac 13 x+\frac 23$

$\frac 12(\sqrt 5-1)$. In addition, we give a counter example to show that the
induction formula does not work for all Cantor distributions. Using the
induction formula we obtain some results and observations which are also given
in this paper.

high-velocity outflows in Civ {\lambda}1549 line profiles. We discuss in this
paper VLT-FORS observations of Civ {\lambda}1549 emission line profiles for a
high-luminosity sample of Hamburg- ESO quasars and how they are affected by
outflow motion as a function of quasar luminosity. Our high- luminosity sample
has the notable advantage that the rest frame has been accurately determined
from previous VLT-ISAAC observations of H{\beta} in the J, H, and K bands. This
makes measures of inter-line velocity shifts accurate and free of systemic
biases. As the redshift increases and the luminosity of the brightest quasars
increases, powerful, high-velocity outflows become more frequent. We discuss
the outflow contextualisation, fol- lowing the 4DE1 formalism, as a tool for
understanding the nature of the so-called weak lined quasars (WLQ) discovered
in recent years as a new, poorly understood class of quasars. We estimate the

study their low energy properties. It includes the two effective tight-binding

moderate intra- and inter-orbital electron correlations related to Bi-($p_{Y}$,

prediction of the temperature dependence of spectral properties. Including
moderate electron correlations, improves the description of the few

calculate the spectral density around the conduction band minimum at

computational kernel in a large number of astrophysics simulations and are
crucial to understanding the electromagnetic signals that originate from the
merger of astrophysical compact objects. Because of the many physical length
scales present when simulating such mergers, these methods must be highly
adaptive and capable of automatically resolving numerous localized features and
instabilities that emerge throughout the computational domain across many
temporal scales. While this has been historically accomplished with adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR) based methods, alternatives based on wavelet bases and
the wavelet transformation have recently achieved significant success in
adaptive representation for advanced engineering applications. This work
presents a new method for the integration of the relativistic hydrodynamic
equations using iterated interpolating wavelets and introduces a highly
adaptive implementation for multidimensional simulation. The wavelet
coefficients provide a direct measure of the local approximation error for the
solution and place collocation points that naturally adapt to the fluid flow
while providing good conservation of fluid quantities. The resulting
implementation, OAHU, is applied to a series of demanding one- and
two-dimensional problems which explore high Lorentz factor outflows and the
formation of several instabilities, including the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

various biosystems, ranging from human body to the environment. Current methods
for analysis of microbial communities are typically based on taxonomic
phylogenetic alignment using 16S rRNA metagenomic or Whole Genome Sequencing
data. In typical characterizations of microbial communities, studies deal with
billions of micobial sequences, aligning them to a phylogenetic tree. We
introduce a new approach for the efficient analysis of microbial communities.
Our new reference-free analysis tech- nique is based on n-gram sequence
analysis of 16S rRNA data and reduces the processing data size dramatically (by
105 fold), without requiring taxonomic alignment. The proposed approach is
applied to characterize phenotypic microbial community differ- ences in
different settings. Specifically, we applied this approach in classification of
microbial com- munities across different body sites, characterization of oral
microbiomes associated with healthy and diseased individuals, and
classification of microbial communities longitudinally during the develop- ment
of infants. Different dimensionality reduction methods are introduced that
offer a more scalable analysis framework, while minimizing the loss in
classification accuracies. Among dimensionality re- duction techniques, we
propose a continuous vector representation for microbial communities, which can
widely be used for deep learning applications in microbial informatics.

the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies relative to their central
counterpart in the redshift range between 0.3 and 0.8. We find that, on
average, these satellites tend to be located on the galactic plane of the
central object. This effect is detected for central galaxies with a stellar
mass larger than 10^10 solar masses and found to be strongest for red passive
galaxies, while blue galaxies exhibit a weaker trend. For galaxies with a minor
axis parallel to the direction of the nearest filament, we find that the
coplanarity is stronger in the vicinity of the central galaxy, and decreases
when moving towards the outskirts of the host halo. By contrast, the spatial
distribution of satellite galaxies relative to their closest filament follows
the opposite trend: their tendency to align with them dominates at large
distances from the central galaxy, and fades away in its vicinity. Relying on
mock catalogs of galaxies in that redshift range, we show that massive red
centrals with a spin perpendicular to their filament also have corotating
satellites well aligned with both the galactic plane and the filament. On the
other hand, lower-mass blue centrals with a spin parallel to their filament
have satellites flowing straight along this filament, and hence orthogonally to
their galactic plane. The orbit of these satellites is then progressively bent
towards a better alignment with the galactic plane as they penetrate the
central region of their host halo. The kinematics previously described are
consistent with satellite infall and spin build-up via quasi-polar flows,
followed by a re-orientation of the spin of massive red galaxies through
mergers.

were introduced given by equivalence classes of unordered partitions satisfying
certain boundary conditions. Here it is shown that H^t is a Catalan set of
order t, that is to say the cardinality of H^t is the t-th Catalan number C(t).
This is a new description of a Catalan set and moreover admits some remarkable
features. Thus to H^t there is an associated labelled graph G_t which is shown
to have a canonical decomposition into (t-1)! subgraphs each with 2^{t-1}
vertices. These subgraphs, called S-graphs, have some tight properties which
are needed for the study of B(infinity). They are described as labelled
hypercubes whose edges connecting vertices with equal labels are missing. It is
shown that the number of distinct hypercubes so obtained is again a Catalan
number, namely C(t-1). They define functions which depend on a coefficient set
of non-negative integers. When the latter are non-zero and pairwise distinct,
the vertices of the S-graphs describe distinct functions. Moreover this
property is retained if certain edges are deleted and certain vertices
identified. In particular when these coefficients are all equal and non-zero,
it is shown that every hypercube degenerates to a simplex, resulting in exactly
t distinct functions, which for example are exactly those needed in the
description of B(infinity) in type A.

question of star formation. One aspect of this is trying to understand whether
the time evolution of accretion rates in deeply embedded objects is best
characterised by a smooth decline from early to late stages or by intermittent
bursts of high accretion.
  Aims: We create synthetic observations of deeply embedded protostars in a
large numerical simulation of a molecular cloud, which are compared directly to
real observations. The goal is to compare episodic accretion events in the
simulation to observations and to test the methodology used for analysing the
observations.
  Methods: Simple freeze-out and sublimation chemistry is added to the
simulation, and synthetic C$^{18}$O line cubes are created for a large number
of simulated protostars. The spatial extent of C$^{18}$O is measured for the
simulated protostars and compared directly to a sample of 16 deeply embedded
protostars observed with the Submillimeter Array. If CO is distributed over a
larger area than predicted based on the protostellar luminosity, it may
indicate that the luminosity has been higher in the past and that CO is still
in the process of refreezing.
  Results: Approximately 1% of the protostars in the simulation show extended
C$^{18}$O emission, as opposed to approximately 50% in the observations,
indicating that the magnitude and frequency of episodic accretion events in the
simulation is too low relative to observations. The protostellar accretion
rates in the simulation are primarily modulated by infall from the larger
scales of the molecular cloud, and do not include any disk physics. The
discrepancy between simulation and observations is taken as support for the
necessity of disks, even in deeply embedded objects, to produce episodic
accretion events of sufficient frequency and amplitude.

Chamaeleon II molecular cloud is an active star forming region that

provide information on the formation mechanisms of substellar objects. Methods.
We performed high sensitivity observations at 870 microns using the LABOCA
bolometer at the APEX telescope towards an active star forming region in
Chamaeleon II. The data are complemented with an extensive multiwavelength
catalogue of sources from the optical to the far-infrared to study the nature
of the LABOCA detections. Results. We detect fifteen cores at 870 microns, and
eleven of them show masses in the substellar regime. The most intense objects
in the surveyed field correspond to the submillimeter counterparts of the well
known young stellar objects DK Cha and IRAS 12500-7658. We identify a possible
proto-brown dwarf candidate (ChaII-APEX-L) with IRAC emission at 3.6 and 4.5
microns. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that most of the spatially
resolved cores are transient, and that the point-like starless cores in the
sub-stellar regime (with masses between 0.016 Msun and 0.066 Msun) could be
pre-brown dwarfs cores gravitationally unstable if they have radii smaller than
220 AU to 907 AU (1.2"" to 5"" at 178 pc) respectively for different masses. ALMA
observations will be the key to reveal the energetic state of these pre-brown
dwarfs candidates.

determinations of this quantity. The new measurement allows an improved
determination of the partial halflife for the superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow
0^+$ Fermi decay to the $^{14}$N first excited state, which impacts the
determination of the $V_{ud}$ element of the CKM matrix. With the new
measurement in place, the corrected $^{14}$O ${\cal F} t $ value is in good
agreement with the average ${\cal F} t $ for other superallowed $0^+

the Experimental Storage Ring of the GSI in Darmstadt. Emphasis is put on
decays via the weak interaction. The first observations of beta-decay into
bound atomic states are described as well as its time mirrored counterpart, the
electron-capture decay. In the latter case the decays of hydrogen- and
helium-like ions are compared with a surprising result. Further on, the
observation of sinusoidal modulations of the decay rate in two-body decays is
summarized. As a possible cause an interference due to the emission of
neutrinos with different rest mass is discussed.

code symbols are protected by two component codes but not necessarily arranged
in a rectangular array. We consider a deterministic construction of GPCs (as
opposed to randomized code ensembles) and analyze the asymptotic performance
over the binary erasure channel under iterative decoding. Our code construction
encompasses several classes of GPCs previously proposed in the literature, such
as irregular PCs, block-wise braided codes, and staircase codes. It is assumed
that the component codes can correct a fixed number of erasures and that the
length of each component code tends to infinity. We show that this setup is
equivalent to studying the behavior of a peeling algorithm applied to a sparse
inhomogeneous random graph. Using a convergence result for these graphs, we
derive the density evolution equations that characterize the asymptotic
decoding performance. As an application, we discuss the design of irregular
GPCs employing a mixture of component codes with different erasure-correcting
capabilities.

challenges of human-centric and machine-to- machine (M2M) applications.
Research has also now started on 5G systems. Scenarios have been proposed and
initial requirements derived. 4G and beyond systems are expected to easily
deliver a wide range of human-centric and M2M applications and services in a
scalable, elastic, and cost efficient manner. The 3GPP IP multimedia subsystem
(IMS) was standardized as the service delivery platform for 3G networks.
Unfortunately, it does not meet several requirements for provisioning
applications and services in 4G and beyond systems. However, cloudifying it
will certainly pave the way for its use as a service delivery platform for 4G
and beyond. This article presents a critical overview of the architectures
proposed so far for cloudifying the IMS. There are two classes of approaches;
the first focuses on the whole IMS system, and the second deals with specific
IMS entities. Research directions are also discussed. IMS granularity and a
PaaS for the development and management of IMS functional entities are the two
key directions we currently foresee.

unsolved problem. Here we report that all ULXs ever spectroscopically observed
have about the same optical spectra apparently of WNL type (late nitrogen
Wolf-Rayet stars) or LBV (luminous blue variables) in their hot state, which
are very scarce stellar objects. We show that the spectra do not originate from
WNL/LBV type donors but from very hot winds from the accretion discs with
nearly normal hydrogen content, which have similar physical conditions as the
stellar winds from these stars. The optical spectra are similar to that of SS
433, the only known supercritical accretor in our Galaxy$^{3}$, although the
ULX spectra indicate a higher wind temperature. Our results suggest that ULXs
with X-ray luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ must constitute a

single-shot pulsed excitation measurements demonstrate that the transition is
cooperative and ultrafast, requiring a critical absorbed photon density to
activate local charge excitations that mediate magnetic-lattice coupling that,
in turn, stabilize the metallic phase. These results reveal that strain

Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with explicit CP violation, which have
important phenomenological implications that may be testable at the LHC. For
soft supersymmetry-breaking scales M_S above a few TeV and a charged Higgs
boson mass M_H+ above a few hundred GeV, new physics effects including those
from explicit CP violation decouple from the light Higgs boson sector. However,
such effects can significantly alter the phenomenology of the heavy Higgs
bosons while still being consistent with constraints from low-energy
observables, for instance electric dipole moments. To consider scenarios with a
charged Higgs boson much heavier than the Standard Model (SM) particles but
much lighter than the supersymmetric particles, we revisit previous
calculations of the MSSM Higgs sector. We compute the Higgs boson masses in the
presence of CP violating phases, implementing improved matching and
renormalization group (RG) effects, as well as two-loop RG effects from the
effective two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) scale M_H+ to the scale M_S. We
illustrate the possibility of non-decoupling CP-violating effects in the heavy
Higgs sector using new benchmark scenarios named CPX4LHC.

CMS to measure the $\Lambda_c$ polarization in the $W$+$c$ samples in Run 2 of
the LHC. This can become the first measurement ever of a longitudinal
polarization of charm quarks. Its results will provide a unique input to the
understanding of polarization transfer in fragmentation. They will also allow
applying the same measurement technique to other (e.g., new physics) samples of
charm quarks in which the polarization is a priori unknown. The proposed
analysis is similar to the ATLAS and CMS measurements of the $W$+$c$ cross
section in the 7 TeV run that used reconstructed $D$-meson decays for charm
tagging.

nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5$TeV, collected
with the LHCb detector at the LHC. The analysis is based on data recorded in
two beam configurations, in which either the direction of the proton or that of
the lead ion is analysed. The correlations are measured in the laboratory
system as a function of relative pseudorapidity, $\Delta\eta$, and relative
azimuthal angle, $\Delta\phi$, for events in different classes of event
activity and for different bins of particle transverse momentum. In
high-activity events a long-range correlation on the near side, $\Delta\phi
\approx 0$, is observed in the pseudorapidity range $2.0<\eta<4.9$. This
measurement of long-range correlations on the near side in proton-lead
collisions extends previous observations into the forward region up to
$\eta=4.9$. The correlation increases with growing event activity and is found
to be more pronounced in the direction of the lead beam. However, the
correlation in the direction of the lead and proton beams are found to be
compatible when comparing events with similar absolute activity in the
direction analysed.

flavour violating (LFV) and lepton number violating (LNV) processes within a
TeV-scale left-right symmetric framework. We show that in both type-I and
type-II seesaw dominance for the light neutrino masses, the triplet of mass
comparable to or smaller than the largest right-handed neutrino mass scale can
give sizeable contribution to the LFV processes, except in the quasi-degenerate
limit of light neutrino masses, where a suppression can occur due to
cancellations. In particular, a moderate value of the heaviest neutrino to
scalar triplet mass ratio $r\lesssim {\cal O}(1)$ is still experimentally
allowed and can be explored in the future LFV experiments. Similarly, the
contribution of a relatively light triplet to the LNV process of neutrinoless
double beta decay could be significant, disfavouring a part of the model
parameter space otherwise allowed by LFV constraints. Nevertheless, we find
regions of parameter space consistent with both LFV and LNV searches, for which
the values of the total effective neutrino mass can be accessible to the next
generation ton-scale experiments. Such light triplets can also be directly
searched for at the LHC, thus providing a complementary probe of this scenario.
Finally, we also study the implications of the triplet contribution for the
left-right symmetric model interpretation of the recent diboson anomaly at the
LHC.

the energy space as time goes to infinity, to a soliton with a possible
different non-zero speed, up to the invariances of the equation. Our analysis
relies on the ideas developed by Martel and Merle for the generalized
Korteweg-de Vries equations. We use the Madelung transform to study the problem
in the hydrodynamical framework. In this framework, we rely on the orbital
stability of the solitons and the weak continuity of the flow in order to
construct a limit profile. We next derive a monotonicity formula for the
momentum, which gives the localization of the limit profile. Its smoothness and
exponential decay then follow from a smoothing result for the localized
solutions of the Schr\""odinger equations. Finally, we prove a Liouville type

stellar mass and halo mass from abundance matching, as well as the observed

census of all observed baryons falls short of this estimate by a factor of two.
Cosmological simulations indicate that the missing baryons might not have
condensed into virialized haloes, but reside throughout the filaments of the
cosmic web (where matter density is larger than average) as a low-density
plasma at temperatures of $10^5-10^7$ kelvin, known as the warm-hot
intergalactic medium. There have been previous claims of the detection of warm
baryons along the line of sight to distant blazars and of hot gas between
interacting clusters. These observations were, however, unable to trace the
large-scale filamentary structure, or to estimate the total amount of warm
baryons in a representative volume of the Universe. Here we report X-ray
observations of filamentary structures of gas at $10^7$ kelvin associated with
the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. Previous observations of this cluster were
unable to resolve and remove coincidental X-ray point sources. After
subtracting these, we reveal hot gas structures that are coherent over scales
of 8 mergaparsecs. The filaments coincide with over-densities of galaxies and
dark matter, with 5-10% of their mass in baryonic gas. This gas has been heated
up by the cluster's gravitational pull and is now feeding its core. Our
findings strengthen evidence for a picture of the Universe in which a large

component is gluon exchange between two fully-dressed quark-gluon vertices,
thus introducing for the first time an obvious scalar-scalar component to the

Abstract has been abridged",,"10.1093/mnras/stw433",,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  White dwarfs (WDs) are the most promising captors of dark matter (DM)
particles in the crests that are expected to build up in the cores of dense
stellar clusters. The DM particles could reach sufficient densities in WD cores
to liberate energy through self-annihilation. The extinction associated with
our Galactic Centre, the most promising region where to look for such effects,
makes it impossible to detect the potential associated luminosity of the
DM-burning WDs. However, in smaller stellar systems which are close enough to
us and not heavily extincted, such as $\omega-$Cen, we may be able to detect
DM-burning WDs. We investigate the prospects of detection of DM-burning WDs in
a stellar cluster harbouring an IMBH, which leads to higher densities of DM at
the centre as compared with clusters without one. We calculate the capture rate
of WIMPs by a WD around an IMBH and estimate the luminosity that a WD would
emit depending on its distance to the center of the cluster. Direct-summation
$N-$body simulations of $\omega-$Cen yield a non-negligible number of WDs in
the range of radii of interest. We apply our assumption to published HST/ACS
observations of stars in the center of $\omega-$Cen to search for DM burning
WDs and, although we are not able to identify any evident candidate because of
crowding and incompleteness, we proof that their bunching up at high
luminosities would be unique. We predict that DM burning will lead to a
truncation of the cooling sequence at the faint end. The detection of DM
burning in future observations of dense stellar clusters, such as globular
clusters or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could allow us to probe different
models of DM distributions and characteristics such as the DM particle
scattering cross section on nucleons. On the other hand, if DM-burning WDs
really exist, their number and properties could give hints to the existence of
IMBHs.

of galaxies triggers cold gas accretion on to a supermassive black hole and
quasar activity. Our model can reproduce the downsizing trend of the evolution
of quasars. We find that the median mass of quasar host dark matter haloes
increases with cosmic time by an order of magnitude from z=4 (a few 1e+11 Msun)
to z=1 (a few 1e+12 Msun), and depends only weakly on the quasar luminosity.
Deriving the quasar bias through the quasar--galaxy cross-correlation function
in the model, we find that the quasar bias does not depend on the quasar
luminosity, similar to observed trends. This result reflects the fact that
quasars with a fixed luminosity have various Eddington ratios and thus have
various host halo masses that primarily determine the quasar bias. We also show
that the quasar bias increases with redshift, which is in qualitative agreement
with observations. Our bias value is lower than the observed values at high
redshifts, implying that we need some mechanisms that make quasars inactive in
low-mass haloes and/or that make them more active in high-mass haloes.

alpha elements (Mg, Si, Ca) in dSph Milky Way satellites of similar stellar
mass and metallicity. Accounting only for the oxygen retained in stars, our
results are consistent with those derived for the alpha elements in dSph
galaxies. Thus, under the assumption that the dSph galaxies lost the bulk of
their gas mass through an environmental process such as tidal stripping, the
estimates of retained metal fractions represent underestimates by roughly a
factor of four. Because of its isolation, Leo P provides an important datum for
the fraction of metals lost as a function of galaxy mass due to star formation.

direct detection experiment. This signature is distinct from the canonical
elastic scattering signal because the inelastic signal also contains the energy
deposited from the subsequent prompt de-excitation of the nucleus. A
measurement of the elastic and inelastic signal will allow a single experiment
to distinguish between a spin-independent and spin-dependent interaction. For
the first time, we characterise the inelastic signal for two-phase xenon
detectors in which dark matter inelastically scatters off the Xe-129 or Xe-131
isotope. We do this by implementing a realistic simulation of a typical
tonne-scale two-phase xenon detector and by carefully estimating the relevant
background signals. With our detector simulation, we explore whether the
inelastic signal from the axial-vector interaction is detectable with upcoming
tonne-scale detectors. We find that two-phase detectors allow for some
discrimination between signal and background so that it is possible to detect
dark matter that inelastically scatters off either the Xe-129 or Xe-131 isotope
for dark matter particles that are heavier than approximately 100 GeV. If,
after two years of data, the XENON1T search for elastic scattering nuclei finds
no evidence for dark matter, the possibility of ever detecting an inelastic
signal from the axial-vector interaction will be almost entirely excluded.

within (down-the-barrel) the LMC disk at an impact parameter of 3.2 kpc. We
find that even in this relatively quiescent region gas flows away from the disk
at speeds up to $\sim$100 km/s in broad and symmetrical absorption in the low

showing little evidence that the ejected gas returns to the LMC and provide
compelling evidence that the LMC drives a global, large-scale outflow across
its disk, which is the likely result of a recent burst of star formation in the
LMC. We find that the outflowing gas is multiphase, ionized by both
photoionization (SiII and SiIII) and collisional ionization (SiIV and CIV). We
estimate a total mass and outflow rate to be $>10^7$ Msun and $>0.4$ Msun/yr.
Since the velocity of this large-scale outflow does not reach the LMC escape
velocity, the gas removal is likely aided by either ram-pressure stripping with
the Milky Way halo or tidal interactions with the surrounding galaxies,
implying that the environment of LMC-like or dwarf galaxies plays an important
role in their ultimate gas starvation. Finally we reassess the mass and
plausible origins of the high-velocity complex toward the LMC given its
newly-determined distance that places it in the lower Milky Way halo and
sky-coverage that shows it extends well beyond the LMC disk.

stellar mass-to-light ratio and hence the functional form of the IMF. We
combine photometric and spectroscopic constraints from the latest set of
population synthesis models of Charlot & Bruzual, including a varying IMF, with
a non-parametric analysis of the lens masses of 18 ETGs from the SLACS survey,
with velocity dispersions in the range 200-300 km/s. We find that very
bottom-heavy IMFs are excluded. However, the upper limit to the bimodal IMF
slope ($\mu \lesssim 2.2$, accounting for a dark matter fraction of 20-30%,
where $\mu=1.3$ corresponds to a Kroupa-like IMF) is compatible at the
$1\sigma$ level with constraints imposed by gravity-sensitive line strengths. A
two-segment power law parameterisation of the IMF (Salpeter-like for high
masses) is more constrained ($\Gamma \lesssim 1.5$, where $\Gamma$ is the power
index at low masses) but requires a dark matter contribution of $\gtrsim 25\%$
to reconcile the results with a Salpeter IMF. For a standard Milky Way-like IMF
to be applicable, a significant dark matter contribution is required within
$1R_e$. Our results reveal a large range of allowed IMF slopes, which, when
interpreted as intrinsic scatter in the IMF properties of ETGs, could explain
the recent results of Smith et al., who find Milky Way-like IMF normalisations

""breathing"" configurations, where both the spacetime geometry and the field
oscillate, and can interact and cluster at the center of stars. We construct
stellar configurations formed by a perfect fluid and a bosonic condensate, and
which may describe the late stages of dark-matter accretion onto stars, in dark
matter-rich environments. These composite stars oscillate at a frequency which
is a multiple of $f=2.5\times 10^{14}\,\left(m_{B}c^2/eV\right)\,{\rm Hz}$.
Using perturbative analysis and Numerical Relativity techniques, we show that
these stars are generically stable, and we provide criteria for instability.
Our results also indicate that the growth of the dark matter core is halted
close to the Chandrasekhar limit. We thus dispel a myth concerning dark matter
accretion by stars: dark mater accretion does not necessarily lead to the
destruction of the star, nor to collapse to a black hole. Finally, we argue
that stars with long-lived bosonic cores may also develop in other theories
with effective mass couplings, such as (massless) scalar-tensor theories.

populations ($\sim 12$ Gyr) cannot be reconciled with (1) its orbit in a simple
model for the Milky Way potential and (2) its short angular extent, both of
which imply that the observed stream formed within the last $<1$ Gyr. Recent
theoretical work has shown that streams on chaotic orbits may abruptly fan out
near their apparent ends; stars in these fans are dispersed in both position
and velocity and may be difficult to associate with the stream. Here we present
the first evidence of such stream-fanning in the Ophiuchus stream, traced by
four blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars beyond the apparent end of the stream.
These stars stand out from the background by their high velocities ($v_{\rm
los} > 230$ km s$^{-1}$) against $\sim 40$ other stars: their velocities are
comparable to those of the stream, but would be exceptional if they were
unrelated halo stars. Their positions and velocities are, however, inconsistent
with simple extrapolation of the observed cold, high-density portion of the
stream. These observations suggest that stream-fanning may be a real,
observable effect and, therefore, that Ophiuchus may be on a chaotic orbit.
They also show that the Ophiuchus stream is more extended and hence dynamically
older than previously thought, easing the stellar population vs. dynamical age
tension.

evaluation of interactions using electronic structure theory, incorporate the
quantum mechanical nature of both the electrons and nuclei, which are essential
to accurately describe systems containing light nuclei. However, path integral
simulations have traditionally required a computational cost around two orders
of magnitude greater than treating the nuclei classically, making them
prohibitively costly for most applications. Here we show that the cost of path
integral simulations can be dramatically reduced by extending our ring polymer
contraction approach to ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. By using
density functional tight binding as a reference system, we show that our ab
initio ring polymer contraction (AI-RPC) scheme gives rapid and systematic
convergence to the full path integral density functional theory result. We
demonstrate the efficiency of this approach in ab initio simulations of liquid
water and the reactive protonated and deprotonated water dimer systems. We find
that the vast majority of the nuclear quantum effects are accurately captured
using contraction to just the ring polymer centroid, which requires the same
number of density functional theory calculations as a classical simulation.
Combined with a multiple time step scheme using the same reference system,
which allows the time step to be increased, our implementation is as fast as a
typical classical ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and 35$\times$ faster
than a full path integral calculation, while still exactly including the
quantum sampling of nuclei. This development thus offers a route to routinely
include nuclear quantum effects in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at
negligible computational cost.

models, one involving an s-channel Z' mediator and the other a t-channel
colored scalar mediator, and consider examples in which the DM-quark couplings
are either isospin conserving or isospin violating after electroweak symmetry
breaking. While previous work on mono-W signals have focused on isospin
violating EFTs, obtaining very strong limits, we find that isospin violating
effects are small once such physics is embedded into a gauge invariant
simplified model. We thus find that the 8 TeV mono-W results are much less
constraining than those arising from mono-jet searches. Considering both the
leptonic (mono-lepton) and hadronic (mono fat jet) decays of the W, we
determine the 14 TeV LHC reach of the mono-W searches with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of
data. While a mono-W signal would provide an important complement to a mono-jet
discovery channel, existing constraints on these models imply it will be a
challenging signal to observe at the 14 TeV LHC.

PopIII star formation event early in the Universe, but also consistent with
later, Population II enrichment. The metals in all three components comprising
the LLS, which has a velocity width of 400 km s$^{-1}$, are offset in velocity
by $\sim+6$ km s$^{-1}$ from the bulk of the hydrogen, suggesting the LLS was
enriched by a single event. Relative abundance measurements in this

(hypergraphs) that avoid certain sub-structures. In particular, we characterize
the classical and parameterized complexity of the problem when the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension) of the input is small.
VC-dimension is a natural measure of complexity of set systems. Several
tractable instances of Hitting Set with a geometric or graph-theoretical flavor
are known to have low VC-dimension. In set systems of bounded VC-dimension,
Hitting Set is known to admit efficient and almost optimal approximation
algorithms (Br\""onnimann and Goodrich, 1995; Even, Rawitz, and Shahar, 2005;
Agarwal and Pan, 2014).
  In contrast to these approximation-results, a low VC-dimension does not
necessarily imply tractability in the parameterized sense. In fact, we show
that Hitting Set is W[1]-hard already on inputs with VC-dimension 2, even if
the VC-dimension of the dual set system is also 2. Thus, Hitting Set is very
unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even in this arguably simple case.
This answers an open question raised by King in 2010. For set systems whose
(primal or dual) VC-dimension is 1, we show that Hitting Set is solvable in
polynomial time.
  To bridge the gap in complexity between the classes of inputs with
VC-dimension 1 and 2, we use a measure that is more fine-grained than
VC-dimension. In terms of this measure, we identify a sharp threshold where the
complexity of Hitting Set transitions from polynomial-time-solvable to NP-hard.
The tractable class that lies just under the threshold is a generalization of
Edge Cover, and thus extends the domain of polynomial-time tractability of
Hitting Set.

Neptune-sized planet transiting an M4.5 dwarf (K2-25) in the Hyades cluster
(650-800 Myr). The lightcurve shows a strong periodic signal at 1.88 days,
which we attribute to spot coverage and rotation. We confirm the planet host is
a member of the Hyades by measuring the radial velocity of the system with the
high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph IGRINS. This enables us to calculate
a distance based on EPIC 210490365's kinematics and membership to the Hyades,
which in turn provides a stellar radius and mass to 5-10%, better than what is
currently possible for most Kepler M dwarfs (12-20%). We use the derived
stellar density as a prior on fitting the K2 transit photometry, which provides
weak constraints on eccentricity. Utilizing a combination of adaptive optics
imaging and high-resolution spectra we rule out the possibility that the signal
is due to a bound or background eclipsing binary, confirming the transits'
planetary origin. EPIC 210490365b has a radius ($3.43^{+0.95}_{-0.31}$R$_{E}$)
much larger than older Kepler planets with similar orbital periods (3.484 days)
and host-star masses (0.29$M_{\odot}$). This suggests that close-in planets
lose some of their atmospheres past the first few hundred Myr. Additional
transiting planets around the Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters from K2
will help confirm if this planet is atypical or representative of other
close-in planets of similar age.

the early Universe predict the formation of primordial black holes. For most
mass ranges, the fraction of matter in the form of primordial black holes is
limited by many different observations on various scales. Primordial black
holes are assumed to be formed when overdensities that cross the horizon have
Schwarzschild radii larger than the horizon. Traditionally it was therefore
assumed that primordial black-hole masses were equal to the horizon mass at
their time of formation. However, detailed calculations of their collapse show
that primordial black holes formed at each point in time should rather form a
spectrum of different masses, obeying critical scaling. Though this has been
known for more than fifteen years, the effect of this scaling behaviour is
largely ignored when considering predictions for primordial black hole mass
spectra. In this paper we consider the critical collapse scaling for a variety
of models which produce primordial black holes, and find that it generally
leads to a shift, broadening and an overall decrease of the mass contained in
primordial black holes. This effect is model and parameter dependent and cannot
be contained by a constant rescaling of the spectrum; it can become important
and should be taken into account when comparing to observational constraints.

They can be caused by various sources, either an instrument's saturation, or a
contamination from an external event, or a data loss. In particular, they can
have a disastrous effect when one is seeking to characterize a
colored-noise-dominated signal in Fourier space, since they create a spectral
leakage that can artificially increase the noise. It is therefore important to
either take them into account or to correct for them prior to e.g. a
Least-Square fit of the signal to be characterized. In this paper, we present
an application of the {\it inpainting} algorithm to mock MICROSCOPE data; {\it
inpainting} is based on a sparsity assumption, and has already been used in
various astrophysical contexts; MICROSCOPE is a French Space Agency mission,
whose launch is expected in 2016, that aims to test the Weak Equivalence
Principle down to the $10^{-15}$ level. We then explore the {\it inpainting}
dependence on the number of gaps and the total fraction of missing values. We
show that, in a worst-case scenario, after reconstructing missing values with
{\it inpainting}, a Least-Square fit may allow us to significantly measure a
$1.1\times10^{-15}$ Equivalence Principle violation signal, which is
sufficiently close to the MICROSCOPE requirements to implement {\it inpainting}
in the official MICROSCOPE data processing and analysis pipeline. Together with
the previously published KARMA method, {\it inpainting} will then allow us to
independently characterize and cross-check an Equivalence Principle violation

of crystalline structures by acting as an impediment to dislocation motion.
However, the presence of an aggressive environment such as hydrogen increases
the susceptibility to intergranular fracture. Further, there is a lack of
systematic investigations exploring the role of hydrogen on the
dislocation-grain-boundary (DGB) interactions. Thus, in this work, the effect
of hydrogen on the interactions between a screw dislocation and <111> tilt GBs
in {\alpha}-Fe were examined. Our simulations reveal that the outcome of the
DGB interaction strongly depends on the underlying GB dislocation network.
Further, there exists a strong correlation between the GB energy and the energy
barrier for slip transmission. In other words, GBs with lower interfacial
energy demonstrate a higher barrier for slip transmission. The introduction of
hydrogen along the GB causes the energy barrier for slip transmission to
increase consistently for all of the GBs examined. The energy balance for a
crack initiation in the presence of hydrogen was examined with the help of our
observations and previous findings. It was found that the presence of hydrogen
increases the strain energy stored within the GB which could lead to a
transgranular-to-intergranular fracture mode transition.

to determining the spatial coordinates of weakly coupled nuclear spins. The
central idea is to label the target nucleus with a spin polarization that
depends on its spatial location, which is subsequently revealed by making this
polarization flow back to the NV for readout. Using extensive analytical and
numerical modeling, we show that the technique can attain high spatial
resolution depending on the NV lifetime and target spin location. No external
magnetic field gradient is required, which circumvents complications resulting
from changes in the direction of the applied magnetic field, and considerably
simplifies the required instrumentation. Extensions of the present technique
may be adapted to pinpoint the locations of other paramagnetic centers in the

planets around nearby stars. A growing literature describes how to characterize
such planets with spectroscopy, but less consideration has been given to the
usefulness of planet colors. Here, we investigate whether potentially
Earth-like exoplanets could be identified using UV-visible-to-NIR wavelength
broadband photometry (350-1000 nm). Specifically, we calculate optimal
photometric bins for identifying an exo-Earth and distinguishing it from
uninhabitable planets including both Solar System objects and model exoplanets.
The color of some hypothetical exoplanets - particularly icy terrestrial worlds
with thick atmospheres - is similar to Earth's because of Rayleigh scattering
in the blue region of the spectrum. Nevertheless, subtle features in Earth's
reflectance spectrum appear to be unique. In particular, Earth's reflectance
spectrum has a 'U-shape' unlike all our hypothetical, uninhabitable planets.
This shape is partly biogenic because O2-rich, oxidizing air is transparent to
sunlight, allowing prominent Rayleigh scattering, while ozone absorbs visible
light, creating the bottom of the 'U'. Whether such uniqueness has practical
utility depends on observational noise. If observations are photon limited or
dominated by astrophysical sources (zodiacal light or imperfect starlight
suppression), then the use of broadband visible wavelength photometry to
identify Earth twins has little practical advantage over obtaining detailed
spectra. However, if observations are dominated by dark current then optimized
photometry could greatly assist preliminary characterization. We also calculate
the optimal photometric bins for identifying extrasolar Archean Earths, and
find that the Archean Earth is more difficult to unambiguously identify than a
modern Earth twin.

momentum, exhibited when either momentum or the collision centrality is
changed. Furthermore, a limited data available for B probes indicate a
qualitatively different pattern, as nearly the same flattening is exhibited for
the curves corresponding to two opposite momentum ranges. We here show that the
experimentally measured suppression curves are well reproduced by our
theoretical predictions, and that the complex suppression patterns are due to
an interplay of collisional, radiative energy loss and the dead-cone effect.
Furthermore, for B mesons, we predict that the uniform flattening of the
suppression indicated by the limited dataset is in fact valid across the entire
span of the momentum ranges, which will be tested by the upcoming experiments.
Overall, the study presented here, provides a rare opportunity for pQCD theory
to qualitatively distinguish between the major energy loss mechanisms at the

  with Minimal Supervision","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1411.7714",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature selection is essential for effective visual recognition. We propose
an efficient joint classifier learning and feature selection method that
discovers sparse, compact representations of input features from a vast sea of
candidates, with an almost unsupervised formulation. Our method requires only
the following knowledge, which we call the \emph{feature sign}---whether or not
a particular feature has on average stronger values over positive samples than
over negatives. We show how this can be estimated using as few as a single
labeled training sample per class. Then, using these feature signs, we extend
an initial supervised learning problem into an (almost) unsupervised clustering
formulation that can incorporate new data without requiring ground truth
labels. Our method works both as a feature selection mechanism and as a fully
competitive classifier. It has important properties, low computational cost and
excellent accuracy, especially in difficult cases of very limited training
data. We experiment on large-scale recognition in video and show superior speed
and performance to established feature selection approaches such as AdaBoost,
Lasso, greedy forward-backward selection, and powerful classifiers such as SVM.

  pulse-gated feedforward neuronal networks",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information transmission is a key element for information processing in the
brain. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for transferring volleys of
spikes between layers of a feedforward neural circuit. Many of these mechanisms
use synchronous activity to provide windows in time when spikes may be
transferred more easily from layer to layer. Recently, we have demonstrated
that a pulse-gating mechanism can transfer graded information between layers in
a feedforward neuronal network. Our transfer mechanism resulted in a
time-translationally invariant firing rate and synaptic current waveforms of
arbitrary amplitude, thus providing exact, graded information transfer between
layers. In this paper, we apply a Fokker-Planck approach to understand how this
translational invariance manifests itself in a high-dimensional, non-linear
feedforward integrate-and-fire network. We show that there is good
correspondence in spiking probabilities between the Fokker-Planck solutions and
our previous mean-field solutions. We identify an approximate line attractor in
state space as the essential structure underlying the time-translational
invariance of our solutions. This approach has enabled us to better understand
the role played by the synaptic coupling, gating pulse and the membrane
potential probability density function in information transfer.

by studying the epoch of cosmic reionization. Previous studies have shown that
DM annihilation was unlikely to have provided a large fraction of the photons
that ionized the universe, but instead played a subdominant role relative to
stars and quasars. The DM, however, begins to efficiently annihilate with the
formation of primordial microhalos at $z\sim100-200$, much earlier than the
formation of the first stars. Therefore, if DM annihilation ionized the
universe at even the percent level over the interval $z \sim 20-100$, it can
leave a significant imprint on the global optical depth, $\tau$. Moreover, we
show that cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization data and future 21 cm
measurements will enable us to more directly probe the DM contribution to the
optical depth. In order to compute the annihilation rate throughout the epoch
of reionization, we adopt the latest results from structure formation studies
and explore the impact of various free parameters on our results. We show that
future measurements could make it possible to place constraints on the dark
matter's annihilation cross section that are at a level comparable to those
obtained from the observations of dwarf galaxies, cosmic ray measurements, and

Dirac dispersions are predicted: one is a surface-originated Dirac cone

millisecond flashes, found primarily at high Galactic latitudes, with

inferred all-sky burst rate is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate
out to redshift 0.5. If the observed dispersion measures are assumed to be
dominated by the intergalactic medium, the sources are at cosmological
distances with redshifts of 0.2 to 1. These parameters are consistent with a
wide range of source models. One fast radio burst showed circular polarization
[21(7)%] of the radio emission, but no linear polarization was detected, and
hence no Faraday rotation measure could be determined. Here we report the
examination of archival data revealing Faraday rotation in a newly detected
burst - FRB 110523. It has radio flux at least 0.6 Jy and dispersion measure
623.30(5) pc cm$^{-3}$. Using Galactic contribution 45 pc cm$^{-3}$ and a model
of intergalactic electron density, we place the source at a maximum redshift of
0.5. The burst has rotation measure -186.1(1.4) rad m$^{-2}$, much higher than
expected for this line of sight through the Milky Way and the intergalactic
medium, indicating magnetization in the vicinity of the source itself or within
a host galaxy. The pulse was scattered by two distinct plasma screens during
propagation, which requires either a dense nebula associated with the source or
a location within the central region of its host galaxy. Keeping in mind that
there may be more than one type of fast radio burst source, the detection in
this instance of source-local magnetization and scattering favours models
involving young stellar populations such as magnetars over models involving the
mergers of older neutron stars, which are more likely to be located in low
density regions of the host galaxy.

Dirac fermions coupled to a circularly polarized laser and an external
reservoir. It is shown that when the separation between quasi-energy bands
becomes small, and comparable to the coupling strength to the reservoir, the
reduced density matrix in the Floquet basis, even at steady-state, has non-zero
off-diagonal elements, with the magnitude of the off-diagonal elements
increasing with the strength of the coupling to the reservoir. In contrast, the
coupling to the reservoir only weakly affects the diagonal elements, hence
inducing an effective coherence. The steady-state reduced density matrix
synchronizes with the periodic drive, and a Fourier analysis allows the
extraction of the occupation probabilities of the Floquet quasi-energy levels.
The lack of detailed balance at steady-state is quantified in terms of an
entropy production rate, and it is shown that this equals the heat current
flowing out of the system, and into the reservoir. It is also shown that the
entropy production rate mainly depends on the off-diagonal components of the
Floquet density matrix. Thus a stronger coupling to the reservoir leads to an
enhanced entropy production rate, implying a more efficient removal of heat
from the system, which in turn helps the system maintain coherence. Analytic
expressions in the vicinity of the Dirac point are derived which highlights
these results, and also indicates how the reservoir may be engineered to
enhance the coherence of the system.

data quality. Although the crowd generates insightful information especially
for complex problems such as entity resolution (ER), the output quality of
crowd workers is often noisy. That is, workers may unintentionally generate
false or contradicting data even for simple tasks. The challenge that we
address in this paper is how to minimize the cost for task requesters while
maximizing ER result quality under the assumption of unreliable input from the
crowd. For that purpose, we first establish how to deduce a consistent ER
solution from noisy worker answers as part of the data interpretation problem.
We then focus on the next-crowdsource problem which is to find the next task
that maximizes the information gain of the ER result for the minimal additional
cost. We compare our robust data interpretation strategies to alternative
state-of-the-art approaches that do not incorporate the notion of
fault-tolerance, i.e., the robustness to noise. In our experimental evaluation
we show that our approaches yield a quality improvement of at least 20% for two
real-world datasets. Furthermore, we examine task-to-worker assignment
strategies as well as task parallelization techniques in terms of their cost
and quality trade-offs in this paper. Based on both synthetic and crowdsourced
datasets, we then draw conclusions on how to minimize cost while maintaining
high quality ER results.

performing chemotaxis. Recent experiments and theories, however, show that even
when single cells do not chemotax, clusters of cells may, if their interactions
are regulated by the chemoattractant. We study this general mechanism of
""collective guidance"" computationally with models that integrate stochastic
dynamics for individual cells with biochemical reactions within the cells, and
diffusion of chemical signals between the cells. We show that if clusters of
cells use the well-known local excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) mechanism
to sense chemoattractant gradients, the speed of the cell cluster becomes
non-monotonic in the cluster's size - clusters either larger or smaller than an
optimal size will have lower speed. We argue that the cell cluster speed is a
crucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal; both
amplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a
function of size. We also show that, contrary to the assumptions of earlier
theories, collective guidance does not require persistent cell-cell contacts
and strong short range adhesion to function. If cell-cell adhesion is absent,
and the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co-attraction mechanism, e.g.
chemotaxis toward a secreted molecule, collective guidance may still function.
However, new behaviors, such as cluster rotation, may also appear in this case.
Together, the combination of co-attraction and adaptation allows for collective
guidance that is robust to varying chemoattractant concentrations while not
requiring strong cell-cell adhesion.

affects the stellar dynamo, (ii) the logR'HK measurements are biased by
extrinsic absorption, either by the interstellar medium (ISM) or by material
local to the system. We present here Hubble Space Telescope/COS far-UV spectra
of WASP-13, which hosts an inflated hot Jupiter and has a measured logR'HK
value (-5.26), well below the basal level. From the star's spectral energy
distribution we obtain an extinction E(B-V) = 0.045+/-0.025 mag and a distance
d = 232+/-8 pc. We detect at >4 sigma lines belonging to three different
ionization states of carbon (C1, C2, and C4) and the Si4 doublet at ~3 sigma.
Using far-UV spectra of nearby early G-type stars of known age, we derive a
C4/C1 flux ratio-age relation, from which we estimate WASP-13's age to be
5.1+/-2.0 Gyr. We rescale the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match the
flux of the C4 1548 doublet. By integrating the rescaled solar spectrum, we
obtain an XUV flux at 1 AU of 5.4 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We use a detailed model of
the planet's upper atmosphere, deriving a mass-loss rate of 1.5x10^11 g s^-1.
Despite the low logR'HK value, the star shows a far-UV spectrum typical of
middle-aged solar-type stars, pointing toward the presence of significant
extrinsic absorption. The analysis of a high-resolution spectrum of the Ca2H&K
lines indicates that the ISM absorption could be the origin of the low logR'HK
value. Nevertheless, the large uncertainty in the Ca2 ISM abundance does not
allow us to firmly exclude the presence of circumstellar gas.

insulator by a heat flow oriented toward its boundary. At a critical heat flux,
the oversaturated thermal gas of magnons accumulated at the boundary
precipitates the condensate, which then grows gradually as the thermal bias is
dialed up further. The thermal magnons thus pumped by the magnonic bulk (spin)
Seebeck effect must generally overcome both the local Gilbert damping
associated with the coherent magnetic dynamics as well as the radiative
spin-wave losses toward the magnetic bulk, in order to achieve the threshold of
condensation. We quantitatively estimate the requisite bias in the case of the
ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet, discuss different physical regimes of
condensation, and contrast it with the competing (so-called Doppler-shift) bulk

distinguishing Tiamat from other large simulation programs is its density of
outputs at high redshift (100 from z=35 to z=5; roughly one every 10 Myr)
enabling the construction of very accurate merger trees at an epoch when galaxy
formation is rapid and mergers extremely frequent. We find that the
friends-of-friends halo mass function agrees well with the prediction of Watson
et al. at high masses, but deviates at low masses, perhaps due to our use of a
different halo finder or perhaps indicating a break from ""universal"" behaviour.
We then analyse the dynamical evolution of galaxies during the Epoch of
Reionization finding that only a small fraction (~20%) of galactic halos are
relaxed. We illustrate this using standard relaxation metrics to establish two
dynamical recovery time-scales: i) halos need ~1.5 dynamical times following
formation, and ii) ~2 dynamical times following a major (3:1) or minor (10:1)
merger to be relaxed. This is remarkably consistent across a wide mass range.
Lastly, we use a phase-space halo finder to illustrate that major mergers drive
long-lived massive phase-space structures which take many dynamical times to
dissipate. This can yield significant differences in the inferred mass build-up
of galactic halos and we suggest that care must be taken to ensure a physically
meaningful match between the galaxy-formation physics of semi-analytic models
and the halo finders supplying their input.

of reionization and is built upon a custom (100 Mpc)$^3$ N-body simulation with
high temporal and mass resolution, allowing us to resolve the galaxy and star
formation physics relevant to early galaxy formation. Our fiducial model with
supernova feedback reproduces the observed optical depth to electron scattering
and evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function between $z$=5 and 7,
predicting that a broad range of halo masses contribute to reionization. Using
a constant escape fraction and global recombination rate, our model is unable
to simultaneously match the observed ionizing emissivity at $z{\lesssim}6$.
However, the use of an evolving escape fraction of 0.05-0.1 at $z{\sim}6$,
increasing towards higher redshift, is able to satisfy these three constraints.
We also demonstrate that photoionization suppression of low mass galaxy
formation during reionization has only a small effect on the ionization history
of the inter-galactic medium. This lack of `self-regulation' arises due to the
already efficient quenching of star formation by supernova feedback. It is only
in models with gas supply-limited star formation that reionization feedback is
effective at regulating galaxy growth. We similarly find that reionization has
only a small effect on the stellar mass function, with no observationally
detectable imprint at $M_{\rm *}{>}10^{7.5}\,{\rm M_{{\odot}}}$. However,
patchy reionization has significant effects on individual galaxy masses, with

self-consistently couples a semi-analytic galaxy-formation model with the
inhomogeneous ionizing UV background, and can therefore be used to study the
dependence of morphology and statistics of reionization on feedback phenomena
of the ionizing source galaxy population. Changes in galaxy-formation physics
modify the sizes of HII regions and the amplitude and shape of 21-cm power
spectra. Of the galaxy physics investigated, we find that supernova feedback
plays the most important role in reionization, with HII regions up to $\approx
20$ per cent smaller and a fractional difference in the amplitude of power
spectra of up to $\approx 17$ per cent at fixed ionized fraction in the absence
of this feedback. We compare our galaxy-formation-based reionization models
with past calculations that assume constant stellar-to-halo mass ratios and
find that with the correct choice of minimum halo mass, such models can mimic
the predicted reionization morphology. Reionization morphology at fixed neutral
fraction is therefore not uniquely determined by the details of galaxy
formation, but is sensitive to the mass of the haloes hosting the bulk of the
ionizing sources. Simple EoR parametrizations are therefore accurate predictors
of reionization statistics. However, a complete understanding of reionization
using future 21-cm observations will require interpretation with realistic

We investigate the dynamics and tunneling channels of true vacuum bubbles for

Minkowski background where its fate is probabilistically given by
non-perturbative effects. Since there exists a tunneling channel toward a
trivial geometry in the entire path integral, the entire information is encoded
in the wave function. This demonstrates that the unitarity is preserved and
there is no loss of information when viewed from the entire wave function of
the universe, whereas a semi-classical observer, who can see only a definitive

existing detectors whose energy thresholds are limited by electronic noise. In
this paper, methods are presented which can lower the electronic noise of these
detectors. Through ultra-low vibration mechanical cooling and wire bonding of a
CMOS charge sensitive preamplifier to a sub-pF p-type point contact HPGe
detector, we demonstrate electronic noise levels below 40 eV-FWHM.

low-energy contribution is concentrated in a narrow range near the bottom of
the conduction band. It has the typical form of a Fermi distribution with an
effective temperature and chemical potential. The effective temperature and
chemical potential in this low-energy term are determined by the intensity of
carriers' generation, the speed of electron-phonon relaxation, rates of
inter-band recombination and electron capture on the defects. In addition,
there is a substantial high-energy correction. This high-energy 'tail' covers
largely the conduction band. The shape of the high-energy 'tail' strongly
depends on the rate of electron-phonon relaxation but does not depend on the
rates of recombination and trapping. We apply the theory to the calculation of
a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in irradiated GaN. Probabilities of
optical excitations from the valence to conduction band and electron-phonon
coupling probabilities in GaN were calculated by the density functional
perturbation theory. Our calculation of both parts of distribution function in
gallium nitride shows that when the speed of electron-phonon scattering is
comparable with the rate of recombination and trapping then the contribution of
the non-Fermi 'tail' is comparable with that of the low-energy Fermi-like
component. So the high-energy contribution can affect essentially the charge
transport in the irradiated and highly doped semiconductors.

develop a universal framework to characterise arbitrary non-Markovian quantum

cases. Our framework constitutes a systematic tool for the effective

If this pattern originates from cosmological effects, then it can be considered
a crucial clue for a violation in the cosmological principle. By defining
various direction dependent statistics in the full-sky Planck 2015 maps (see,
for instance, Naselsky et al. (2012); W. Zhao (2014)), we found that the CMB
parity asymmetry has a preferred direction, which is independent of the choices
of the statistics. In particular, this preferred axis is strongly aligned with
those in the CMB quadrupole and octopole, as well as that in the CMB kinematic
dipole, which hints to their non-cosmological origin. In realistic
observations, the foreground residuals are inevitable, and should be properly
masked out in order to avoid possible misinterpretation of the results. In this
paper, we extend our previous analyses to the masked Planck 2015 data. By
defining a similar direction dependent statistic in the masked map, we find a
preferred direction of the CMB parity asymmetry, in which the axis also
coincides with that found in the full-sky analysis. Therefore, our conclusions
on the CMB parity violation and its directional properties are confirmed.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) which upscatters inelastically to a
heavier state and predominantly couples to the spin of protons. In this
scenario constraints from xenon and germanium targets are evaded dynamically,
due to the suppression of the WIMP coupling to neutrons, while those from
fluorine targets are evaded kinematically, because the minimal WIMP incoming
speed required to trigger upscatters off fluorine exceeds the maximal WIMP
velocity in the Galaxy, or is very close to it. In this scenario WIMP
scatterings off sodium are usually sensitive to the large-speed tail of the
WIMP velocity distribution and modulated fractions of the signal close to unity
arise in a natural way. On the other hand, a halo-independent analysis with
more conservative assumptions about the WIMP velocity distribution allows to
extend the viable parameter space to configurations where large modulated
fractions are not strictly necessary. We discuss large modulated fractions in
the Maxwellian case showing that they imply a departure from the usual cosine
time dependence of the expected signal in DAMA. However we explicitly show that
the DAMA data is not sensitive to this distortion, both in time and frequency
space, even in the extreme case of a 100 % modulated fraction. Moreover the
same scenario provides an explanation of the maximum in the energy spectrum of
the modulation amplitude detected by DAMA in terms of WIMPs whose minimal
incoming speed matches the kinematic threshold for inelastic upscatters. For
the elastic case the detection of such maximum suggests an inversion of the
modulation phase below the present DAMA energy threshold, while this is not
expected for inelastic scattering. This may allow to discriminate between the
two scenarios in a future low-threshold analysis of the DAMA data.

vortex field to the OAM carried by the azimuthally varying polarized vector
field. The arbitrary OAM has the same characteristics as the well-defined
integer OAM: intrinsic OAM, uniform local OAM and intensity ring, and
propagation stability. The arbitrary OAM has unique natures: it is allowed to
be flexibly tailored and the radius of the focusing ring can have various
choices for a desired OAM, which are of great significance to the benefit of
surprising applications of the arbitrary OAM.

consider a power grid that is supplied by one conventional generator (CG) and
multiple renewable generators (RGs) each co-located with storage,and is
connected with external markets. An aggregator operates the power grid to
maintain power balance between supply and demand. Aiming at minimizing the
long-term system cost, we first propose a real-time centralized power balancing
solution, taking into account the uncertainty of the renewable generation,
loads, and energy prices. We then provide a distributed implementation
algorithm, significantly reducing both computational burden and communication
overhead. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal
as the storage capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint loosens.
Moreover, the distributed implementation enjoys a fast convergence rate, and
enables each RG and the aggregator to make their own decisions. Simulation
shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives and can achieve
near-optimal performance for a wide range of storage capacity.

implied by the mean field assumption, first order transitions required non-zero
initial densities of sick individuals. For the stochastic model studied here
the results depend strongly on the underlying network. First order transitions
are found when there are few short but many long loops: (i) No first order
transitions exist on trees and on 2-d lattices with local contacts (ii) They do
exist on Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, on d-dimensional lattices with d >= 4, and
on 2-d lattices with sufficiently long-ranged contacts; (iii) On 3-d lattices

initial densities of infected nodes; (v) In all cases the first order
transitions are actually ""hybrid"", i.e. they display also power law scaling

model can also be interpreted as the growth of an interface due to cooperative
attachment of two species of particles. Critically pinned interfaces in this
model seem to be in different universality classes than standard critically
pinned interfaces in models with forbidden overhangs. Finally, the detailed

method uses matrix-free GMRES to solve the linear systems of equations that
arise in the nonlinear iterations, with matrix-vector products computed via the
linearized sensitivity evolution equations. The adjoint method is used to
compute gradients for the gradient-based optimization shooting methods. The
Newton-Krylov method is shown to exhibit superior convergence to the optimal
solution for these fluid problems, and fully leverages quality starting data.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the adjoint
equations and the corresponding adjoint method for fully discrete,
time-periodically constrained partial differential equations. These adjoint
equations constitute a linear, two-point boundary value problem that is
provably solvable. The periodic adjoint method is used to compute gradients of
quantities of interest along the manifold of time-periodic solutions of the
discrete partial differential equation, which is verified against a
second-order finite difference approximation. These gradients are then used in
a gradient-based optimization framework to determine the energetically optimal
flapping motion of a 2D airfoil in compressible, viscous flow over a single

preconditioning procedures SPAI, PSAI($tol$) and RSAI($tol$) are costly and
even impractical to construct preconditioners for a large sparse nonsymmetric

they are efficient for double regular sparse problems. Double irregular sparse
linear systems have a wide range of applications, and 4.4\% of the nonsymmetric

this class of problems, we propose a transformation approach, which consists of
four steps: (i) transform a given double irregular sparse problem into a small

$\hat{A}$, (ii) use SPAI, PSAI($tol$) and RSAI($tol$) to construct sparse

approximate solution of the original problem with a prescribed accuracy from
those of the double regular sparse ones. A number of theoretical and practical

chemical and dynamical properties of the discs of spiral galaxies as a function
of radius. Methods: We make use of the simulated Milky-Way mass,
fully-cosmological discs, from {\tt RaDES} (Ramses Disc Environment Study). We
analyse their assembly history by examining the proximity of satellites to the
galactic disc, instead of their merger trees, to better gauge which satellites
impact the disc. We present stellar age and metallicity profiles,
Age-Metallicity Relation (AMR), Age-Velocity dispersion Relation (AVR), and
Stellar Age Distribution (SAD) in several radial bins for the simulated
galaxies. Results: Assembly histories can be divided into three different
stages: i) a merger dominated phase, when a large number of mergers with mass
ratios of $\sim$1:1 take place (lasting $\sim$3.2$\pm$0.4 Gyr on average); ii)
a quieter phase, when $\sim$1:10 mergers take place (lasting $\sim$4.4$\pm$2.0
Gyr) - these two phases are able to kinematically heat the disc and produce a
disc that is chemically mixed over its entire radial extension; iii) a
""secular"" phase where the few mergers that take place have mass ratios below
1:100, and which do not affect the disc properties (lasting $\sim$5.5$\pm$2.0
Gyr). Phase ii ends with a final merger event (at time $t_\mathrm{jump}$)
marking the onset of important radial differences in the AMR, AVR, and SAD.
Conclusions: Inverted AMR trends in the outer parts of discs, for stars younger
than $t_\mathrm{jump}$, are found as the combined effect of radial motions and
star formation in satellites temporarily located in these outer parts.
""U-shaped"" stellar age profiles change to an old plateau ($\sim$10 Gyr) in the
outer discs for the entire {\tt RaDES} sample. This shape is a consequence of
inside-out growth of the disc, radial motions of disc stars ... [abridged]

multi-threaded coronal loop. Considering 23 non-potential magnetic threads
within a loop, we use 3D MHD simulations to show that only one thread needs to
be unstable in order to start an avalanche even when the others are below
marginal stability. This has significant implications for coronal heating in
that it provides for energy dissipation with a trigger mechanism. The
instability of the unstable thread follows the evolution determined in many
earlier investigations. However, once one stable thread is disrupted, it
coalesces with a neighbouring thread and this process disrupts other nearby
threads. Coalescence with these disrupted threads then occurs leading to the
disruption of yet more threads as the avalanche develops. Magnetic energy is
released in discrete bursts as the surrounding stable threads are disrupted.
The volume integrated heating, as a function of time, shows short spikes
suggesting that the temporal form of the heating is more like that of
\textit{nanoflares} than of constant heating.

interest in the scientific community. Several novel phenomena have been shown
to emerge from the interaction of conducting electrons with the skyrmion
lattice, such as a topological Hall-effect and a spin-transfer torque at
ultra-low current densities. In the insulating compound Cu2OSeO3,
magneto-electric coupling enables control of the skyrmion lattice via electric
fields, promising a dissipation-less route towards novel spintronic devices.
One of the outstanding fundamental issues is related to the thermodynamic
stability of the skyrmion lattice. To date, the skyrmion lattice in bulk
materials has been found only in a narrow temperature region just below the
order-disorder transition. If this narrow stability is unavoidable, it would
severely limit applications. Here we present the discovery that applying just
moderate pressure on Cu2OSeO3 substantially increases the absolute size of the
skyrmion pocket. This insight demonstrates directly that tuning the electronic
structure can lead to a significant enhancement of the skyrmion lattice
stability. We interpret the discovery by extending the previously employed
Ginzburg-Landau approach and conclude that change in the anisotropy is the main
driver for control of the size of the skyrmion pocket. This realization
provides an important guide for tuning the properties of future skyrmion
hosting materials.

pump the vacuum and 1 GeV photons to probe the birefringent effect. The vacuum
birefringence can be measured via the polarization flip of the probe
$\gamma$-rays which can also be interpreted as phase retardation of probe
photons. We provide theoretically how to extract phase retardation of GeV probe
photons via pair-wise topology of the Bethe-Heitler process in a polarimeter

Sachs--Wolfe (ISW) effect, i.e., secondary CMB fluctuations generated by
evolving gravitational potentials due to the transition between, e.g., the
matter and dark energy (DE) dominated phases. Therefore, assuming a flat
universe, DE properties can be inferred from ISW detections. We present a
Bayesian approach to compute the CMB--LSS cross-correlation signal. The method
is based on the estimate of the likelihood for measuring a combined set
consisting of a CMB temperature and a galaxy contrast maps, provided that we
have some information on the statistical properties of the fluctuations
affecting these maps. The likelihood is estimated by a sampling algorithm,
therefore avoiding the computationally demanding techniques of direct
evaluation in either pixel or harmonic space. As local tracers of the matter
distribution at large scales, we used the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)
galaxy catalog and, for the CMB temperature fluctuations, the ninth-year data
release of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9). The results show a
dominance of cosmic variance over the weak recovered signal, due mainly to the
shallowness of the catalog used, with systematics associated with the sampling
algorithm playing a secondary role as sources of uncertainty. When combined
with other complementary probes, the method presented in this paper is expected

researchers since they form quantum liquids with correlated ground states and
low-lying excitations, which exhibit universal behaviour. In fermionic systems,
such quantum liquids are realized in helium-3 liquid, heavy fermion systems,
neutron stars and cold gases. Their properties in the linear-response regime
have been successfully described by the theory of Fermi liquids. However,
non-equilibrium properties beyond this regime have still to be established and
remain a key issue of many-body physics. Here, we show a precise experimental
demonstration of Landau Fermi-liquid theory extended to the non-equilibrium
regime in a 0-D system. Combining transport and ultra-sensitive current noise
measurements, we have unambiguously identified the SU(2) and SU(4) symmetries
of quantum liquid in a carbon nanotube tuned in the universal Kondo regime. We
find that, while the electronic transport is well described by the free
quasi-particle picture around equilibrium, a two-particle scattering process
due to residual interaction shows up in the non-equilibrium regime. By using
the extended Fermi-liquid theory, we obtain the interaction parameter ""Wilson
ratio"" $R=1.9 \pm 0.1$ for SU(2) and $R=1.35 \pm 0.1$ for SU(4) as well as the
corresponding effective charges, characterizing the quantum liquid behaviour.
This result, in perfect agreement with theory, provides a strong quantitative
experimental background for further developments of the many-body physics.
Moreover, we discovered a new scaling law for the effective charge, signalling
as-yet-unknown universality in the non-equilibrium regime. Our method to
address quantum liquids through their non-equilibrium noise paves a new road to
tackle the exotic nature of quantum liquids out-of-equilibrium in various

the detailed comparison between chemical abundances derived from neutral and
from ionized spectral lines as a powerful stellar ""weighing device"" to measure
stellar mass and to identify an evolved BSS in 47 Tucanae. In particular,
high-resolution spectra of three bright stars located slightly above the level
of the ""canonical"" horizontal branch sequence in the color-magnitude diagram of

and titanium abundances performed separately from neutral and ionized lines
reveal that two targets have stellar parameters fully consistent with those

target the elemental ionization balance is obtained only by assuming a mass of
~1.4Msol, which is significantly larger than the main sequence turn-off mass of
the cluster (~0.85 Msol). The comparison with theoretical stellar tracks

In both implementations, unified API has been designed to guarantee the

primary aim is to obtain information on the energy stored in the Coulomb

We performed temperature-dependent ellipsometry measurements on several
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8-x}$ single crystals: under-doped with $T_c=60, 70$
and 83K, optimally doped with $T_c=91$K, overdoped with $T_c=84, 81, 70$ and
$58$K, as well as optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+x}$ with
$T_c=110$K. Our first observation is that, as the temperature drops through
$T_c$, the loss function in the range up to 2~eV displays a change of
temperature dependence as compared to the temperature dependence in the normal
state. This effect at - or close to - $T_c$ depends strongly on doping, with a
sign-change for weak overdoping. The size of the observed change in Coulomb
energy, using an extrapolation with reasonable assumptions about its
$q$-dependence, is about the same size as the condensation energy that has been
measured in these compounds. Our results therefore lend support to the notion
that the Coulomb energy is an important factor for stabilizing the
superconducting phase. Due to the restriction to small momentum, our
observations do not exclude a possible significant contribution to the
condensation energy of the Coulomb energy associated to the region of $q$
around $(\pi,\pi)$.

white dwarf into a neutron star [Piro & Thompson 2014] allow for a potentially
detectable transient electromagnetic signal. Motivated by these results, I
present theoretical rates and physical properties of binary stars that can
produce accretion-induced collapse. The rates are presented for various types
of host galaxies (e.g. old ellipticals versus spirals) and are differentiated
by the donor star type (e.g. large giant star versus compact helium-rich
donor). Results presented in this thesis may help to guide near-future
electromagnetic transient search campaigns to find likely candidates for
accretion-induced collapse events. My predictions are based on binary evolution
calculations that include the most recent updates on mass accretion and secular
mass growth of white dwarfs. I find that the most likely systems that undergo
accretion-induced collapse consist of an ONeMg white dwarf with a Hertzsprung
gap star or a red giant companion. Typical rates are of the order ~1-5 x 10^-5
1/yr and ~10^-4-10^-5 1/yr in large spiral galaxies and old ellipticals,
respectively. The brightest electromagnetic signals are predicted for evolved
giant type donors for which I find rates of the order ~2.5 x 10^-5 1/yr (large
spirals) and ~1.3 x 10^-5 1/yr (old ellipticals).

the classical spectroscopic approach, we perform the chemical analysis using
three different methods to constrain effective temperatures and surface
gravities. When atmospheric parameters are derived spectroscopically, we
measure a trimodal metallicity distribution, that well resembles that by Yong

differs from the distribution obtained from Fe I features when photometric

distribution obtained using spectroscopic parameters, while the Fe II shows the
presence of only two stellar groups with metallicity [Fe/H]$\simeq$-1.5 and
-1.1 dex, which are internally homogeneous in iron. This finding, when coupled

photoexcitation of the DNA and the SWNTs in the UV and visible range,
respectively. A strong SWNT photoluminescence quenching is observed when the UV
pump is resonant with the DNA absorption, consistent with charge transfer from
the excited states of the DNA to the SWNT. Semiempirical calculations of the
DNA-SWNT electronic structure, combined with a Green's function theory for
charge transfer, show a 20 fs autoionization rate, dominated by the hole
transfer. Rate-equation analysis of the spectroscopy data confirms that the
quenching rate is limited by the thermalization of the free charge carriers
transferred to the nanotube reservoir. The developed approach has a great
potential for monitoring DNA excitation, autoionization, and chemical damage

  in time series","21 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables",,,,"stat.ME physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entropy measures have become increasingly popular as an evaluation metric for
complexity in the analysis of time series data, especially in physiology and
medicine. Entropy measures the rate of information gain, or degree of
regularity in a time series e.g. heartbeat. Ideally, entropy should be able to
quantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as
determine if the variation arises from a random process. Unfortunately current
entropy measures mostly are unable to perform the latter differentiation. Thus,
a high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, whereas a low score
indicates a high degree of regularity. This leads to the observation that
current entropy measures are equivalent to evaluating how random a series is,
or conversely the degree of regularity in a time series. This raises the
possibility that existing tests for randomness, such as the runs test or
permutation test, may have similar utility in diagnosing certain conditions.
This paper compares various tests for randomness with existing entropy-based
measurements such as sample entropy, permutation entropy and multi-scale
entropy. Our experimental results indicate that the test statistics of the runs
test and permutation test are often highly correlated with entropy scores and
may be able to provide further information regarding the complexity of time
series.

  Euromicro PDP 2014 conference",,,,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes to use a frequency based cache admission policy in order
to boost the effectiveness of caches subject to skewed access distributions.
Given a newly accessed item and an eviction candidate from the cache, our
scheme decides, based on the recent access history, whether it is worth
admitting the new item into the cache at the expense of the eviction candidate.
  Realizing this concept is enabled through a novel approximate LFU structure
called TinyLFU, which maintains an approximate representation of the access
frequency of a large sample of recently accessed items. TinyLFU is very compact
and light-weight as it builds upon Bloom filter theory.
  We study the properties of TinyLFU through simulations of both synthetic
workloads as well as multiple real traces from several sources. These
simulations demonstrate the performance boost obtained by enhancing various
replacement policies with the TinyLFU eviction policy. Also, a new combined
replacement and eviction policy scheme nicknamed W-TinyLFU is presented.
W-TinyLFU is demonstrated to obtain equal or better hit-ratios than other state
of the art replacement policies on these traces. It is the only scheme to
obtain such good results on all traces.

data from the NVST have a stable and reliable quality, which are suitable for
studying the igBPs. In addition, our method is feasible to detect and track the
igBPs in the TiO data from the NVST. With the aid of the vector magnetograms
obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory /Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager,
the properties of igBPs are found to be influenced by their embedded magnetic
environments strongly. The area coverage, the size and the intensity contrast
values of igBPs are generally larger in the regions with higher magnetic flux.
However, the dynamics of igBPs, including the horizontal velocity, the
diffusion index, the ratio of motion range and the index of motion type are
generally larger in the regions with lower magnetic flux. It suggests that the
absence of strong magnetic fields in the medium makes it possible for the igBPs
to look smaller and weaker, diffuse faster, move faster and further in a
straighter path.

spatial model systems that address robustness of biological diversity. In
particular the game nicely illustrates that cyclic interactions allow multiple
strategies to coexist for long time intervals. When formulated in terms of a
one-dimensional cellular automata, the spatial distribution of strategies
exhibits coarsening with algebraically growing domain size over time, while the
two-dimensional version allows domains to break and thereby opens for long-time
coexistence. We here consider a quasi-one-dimensional implementation of the
cyclic competition, and study the long-term dynamics as a function of rare
invasions between parallel linear ecosystems. We find that increasing the
complexity from two to three parallel subsystems allows a transition from
complete coarsening to an active steady state where the domain size stays
finite. We further find that this transition happens irrespective of whether
the update is done in parallel for all sites simultaneously, or done randomly
in sequential order. In both cases the active state is characterized by
localized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In
the case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase
transition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the
three-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied. We
identify the critical parameter for this transition, and show that the density
of active boundaries have critical exponents that are consistent with the
directed percolation universality class. On the other hand, numerical
simulations with the random sequential dynamics suggest that the system may
exhibit an active steady state as long as the invasion rate is finite.

Learning extension of Conditional Neural Fields (CNF), which is an integration
of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and shallow neural networks. DeepCNF can
model not only complex sequence-structure relationship by a deep hierarchical
architecture, but also interdependency between adjacent SS labels, so it is
much more powerful than CNF. Experimental results show that DeepCNF can obtain
~84% Q3 accuracy, ~85% SOV score, and ~72% Q8 accuracy, respectively, on the
CASP and CAMEO test proteins, greatly outperforming currently popular
predictors. As a general framework, DeepCNF can be used to predict other
protein structure properties such as contact number, disorder regions, and
solvent accessibility.

evolved by viruses upon entry into a vertebrate host. The infected cell life
cycle consists of a non-productively infected stage in which it is producing
virions but not releasing them and of a productively infected stage in which it
is just releasing virions. The study explores why the infected cell cycle
should be so delineated, something which is akin to a classic bang-bang control
or all-or-none principle. The times spent in each of these stages represent a
viral strategy to optimize peak viral load. Increasing the time spent in the
non-productively infected phase ({\tau}1) would lead to a concomitant increase
in peak viremia. However increasing this time would also invite a more vigorous
response from Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs). Simultaneously, if there is a
vigorous antibody response, then we might expect {\tau}1 to be high, in order
that the virus builds up its population and conversely if there is a weak
antibody response, {\tau}1 might be small. These tradeoffs are explored using a
mathematical model of virus propagation using Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs). The study raises questions about whether common viruses have actually
settled into an optimum, the role for reliability and whether experimental
infections of hosts with non-endemic strains could help elicit answers about
viral progression.

It has been pointed out that no scheme using only linear elements can implement

auxiliary means. Here we present a symmetry-broken scheme with linear optics

deterministically identify four Bell states with success probabilities beyond

our setting), then our answers differ from the classical ones when uniform or
other priors are imposed. We can actually retrieve the classical answers by
imposing the relevant priors, so our setup can and should be interpreted as a

functions instead of classical probabilities. We also discuss consequences of

(ASSC) stellar cloud. We assume stress tensor of the higher order geometrical
terms to be treat as an-isotropic imperfect fluid with time dependent density
function $\rho(t)$ and radial and tangential pressures $p_r(t)$ and $p_t(t)$
respectively. We solved linearized metric equation via perturbation method and
obtained 12 different kinds of metric solutions. Calculated Ricci and
Kretschmann scalars of our metric solutions are non-singular at beginning of
the collapse for 2 kinds of them only. Event and apparent horizons are formed
at finite times for two kinds of singular metric solutions while 3 metric
solutions exhibit with event horizon only with no formed apparent horizon.
There are obtained 3 other kinds of the metric solutions which exhibit with
apparent horizon with no formed event horizon. Furthermore 3 kinds of our
metric solutions do not exhibit with horizons. Barotropic index of all 12 kinds
of metric solutions are calculated also. They satisfy different regimes such as
domain walls (6 kinds), cosmic string (2 kinds), dark matter (2 kinds),
anti-matter (namely negative energy density) (1 kind) and stiff matter (1
kind). Time dependent radial null geodesics expansion parameter $\Theta(t)$ is
also calculated for all 12 kinds of our metric solutions. In summary 4 kinds of
our solutions take absolutely positive value $\Theta>0$ which means the
collapse ended to a naked singularity but 8 kinds of our metric solutions ended
to a covered singularity at end of the collapse where $\Theta\leq0$ and so
trapped surfaces are appeared.

interactions with some other proteins to do so. Numerous factors are there
which can regulate the interactions between proteins [4]. Here in this present
study we aim to understand Protein -Protein Interactions (PPIs) of two proteins
ABCB11 and ADA from quantitative point of view. One of our major aims also is
to study the factors that regulate the PPIs and thus to distinguish these PPIs
with proper quantification across the two species Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus
respectively to know how one protein interacts with different set of proteins
in different species.
