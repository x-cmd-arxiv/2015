Under the
rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we apply the gauge independent Berry
curvature over a surface integral to calculate the Berry phase of the
eigenstates for both single and two-qubit systems, which is found to be
identical with the system of spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. We extend
the idea to define a vacuum-induced geometric curvature when the system starts
from an initial state with pure vacuum bosonic field. The induced geometric
phase is related to the average photon number in a period which is possible to
measure in the qubit-cavity system. We also calculate the geometric phase
beyond the RWA and find an anomalous sudden change, which implies the breakdown
of the adiabatic theorem and the Berry phases in an adiabatic cyclic evolution
are ill-defined near the anti-crossing point in the spectrum.

counter-part of the Einstein--Maxwell (EM) equations in general relativity, and
have been recently studied in \cite{ambitoric1, LeB0, LeB, KTF}. We show how
the existence problem of such Hermitian metrics (which we call in any dimension
{\it conformally K\""ahler, EM} metrics) fits into a formal momentum map
interpretation, analogous to results by Donaldson and Fujiki~\cite{donaldson,
fujiki} in the cscK case. This leads to a suitable notion of a Futaki invariant
which provides an obstruction to the existence of conformally K\""ahler, EM
metrics invariant under a certain group of automorphisms which are associated
to a given K\""ahler class, a real holomorphic vector field on $(M,J)$, and a
positive normalization constant. Specializing to the toric case, we further
define a suitable notion of $K$-polystability and show it provides a (stronger)
necessary condition for the existence of toric, conformally K\""ahler, EM
metrics. We use the methods of \cite{ambitoric2} to show that on a compact
symplectic toric $4$-orbifold with second Betti number equal to $2$,
$K$-polystability is also a sufficient condition for the existence of (toric)
conformally K\""ahler, EM metrics, and the latter are explicitly described as
ambitoric in the sense of \cite{ambitoric1}. As an application, we exhibit many
new examples of conformally K\""ahler, EM metrics defined on compact

entangle pairs of qubits in different quantum computing systems. Typically a
longer-span non-local state or sequential application of few-qubit entangling
gates are needed to produce a non-trivial multiqubit gate. In many cases a
single non-local state that span over the entire system is difficult to use due
to spectral crowding or impossible to have. At the same time, many multiqubit
systems can naturally develop a network of multiple non-local higher-energy
states that span over few qubits each. We show that continuous time quantum
walks can be used to address this problem by involving multiple such states to
perform local and entangling operations concurrently on many qubits. This
introduces an alternative approach to multiqubit gate compression based on
available physical resources. We formulate general requirements for such walks
and discuss configurations of non-local auxiliary states that can emerge in
quantum computing architectures based on self-assembled quantum dots, defects
in diamond, and superconducting qubits, as examples. Specifically, we discuss a
scalable multiqubit quantum register constructed as a single chain with
nearest-neighbor interactions. We illustrate how quantum walks can be
configured to perform single-, two- and three-qubit gates, including Hadamard,
Control-NOT, and Toffoli gates. Continuous time quantum walks on graphs

they are still the subject of intense debate, with the largest uncertainty
being related to the ""calibration"" of the visual acuity of individual observers
in the past. Daisy-chain regression methods are applied to inter-calibrate the
observers which may lead to significant bias and error accumulation. Here we
present a novel method to calibrate the visual acuity of the key observers to
the reference data set of Royal Greenwich Observatory sunspot groups for the
period 1900-1976, using the statistics of the active-day fraction. For each
observer we independently evaluate their observational thresholds [S_S] defined
such that the observer is assumed to miss all of the groups with an area
smaller than S_S and report all the groups larger than S_S. Next, using a
Monte-Carlo method we construct, from the reference data set, a correction
matrix for each observer. The correction matrices are significantly non-linear
and cannot be approximated by a linear regression or proportionality. We
emphasize that corrections based on a linear proportionality between annually
averaged data lead to serious biases and distortions of the data. The
correction matrices are applied to the original sunspot group records for each
day, and finally the composite corrected series is produced for the period
since 1748. The corrected series displays secular minima around 1800 (Dalton
minimum) and 1900 (Gleissberg minimum), as well as the Modern grand maximum of
activity in the second half of the 20th century. The uniqueness of the grand
maximum is confirmed for the last 250 years. It is shown that the adoption of a
linear relationship between the data of Wolf and Wolfer results in grossly
inflated group numbers in the 18th and 19th centuries in some reconstructions.

Ultra-Violet (UV) freeze-in mechanism, for the case of fermionic Higgs portal
dark matter $\psi$ produced via the portal interaction $\bar{\psi}\psi

the non-thermal energy distribution of dark matter from freeze-in. We show that
the non-thermal energy distribution from UV freeze-in is hotter than the
corresponding thermal distribution and has the form of a Bose-Einstein
distribution with a non-thermal normalization. The resulting range of dark
matter fermion mass consistent with observations is 5-7 keV. The reheating
temperature must satisfy $T_{R} \gtrsim 120 $ GeV in order to account for the
observed dark matter density when $m_{\psi} \approx 5 $ keV, where the lower
bound on $T_{R}$ corresponds to the limit where the fermion mass is entirely
due to electroweak symmetry breaking via the portal interaction. The
corresponding bound on the interaction scale is $\Lambda \gtrsim 6.0 \times

unique paths for content-based routing from a publisher to interested
subscribers. Cyclic overlays may provide multiple paths, however, the
subscription broadcast process generates one content-based routing path per
subscription. This poses serious challenges in offering dynamic routing of
notifications when congestion is detected because instantaneous updates in
routing tables are required to generate alternative routing paths. This paper
introduces the first subscription-based publish/subscribe system, OctopiS,
which offers inter-cluster dynamic routing when congestion in the output queues
is detected. OctopiS is based on a formally defined Structured Cyclic Overlay
Topology (SCOT). SCOT is divided into homogeneous clusters where each cluster
has equal number of brokers and connects to other clusters through multiple
inter-cluster overlay links. These links are used to provide parallel routing
paths between publishers and subscribers connected to brokers in different
clusters. While aiming at deployment at data center networks, OctopiS generates
subscription-trees of shortest lengths used by Static Notification Routing
(SNR) algorithm. Dynamic Notification Routing (DNR) algorithm uses a bit-vector
mechanism to exploit the structuredness of a clustered SCOT to offer
inter-cluster dynamic routing without making updates in routing tables and
minimizing load on overwhelmed brokers and congested links. Experiments on a
cluster testbed with real world data show that OctopiS is scalable and reduces
the number of inter-broker messages in subscription delivery by 89%,
subscription delay by 77%, end-to-end notification delay in static and dynamic
routing by 47% and 58% respectively, and the lengths of output queues of

the energy-aware design of the network selection, subchannel, and power
allocation in cellular and Wi-Fi networks, while taking into account the
traffic delay of mobile users. The problem is particularly challenging due to
the two-timescale operations for the network selection (large timescale) and
subchannel and power allocation (small timescale). Based on the two-timescale
Lyapunov optimization technique, we first design an online Energy-Aware Network
Selection and Resource Allocation (ENSRA) algorithm. The ENSRA algorithm yields
a power consumption within O(1/V) bound of the optimal value, and guarantees an
O(V) traffic delay for any positive control parameter V. Motivated by the
recent advancement in the accurate estimation and prediction of user mobility,
channel conditions, and traffic demands, we further develop a novel predictive
Lyapunov optimization technique to utilize the predictive information, and
propose a Predictive Energy-Aware Network Selection and Resource Allocation
(P-ENSRA) algorithm. We characterize the performance bounds of P-ENSRA in terms
of the power-delay tradeoff theoretically. To reduce the computational
complexity, we finally propose a Greedy Predictive Energy-Aware Network
Selection and Resource Allocation (GP-ENSRA) algorithm, where the operator
solves the problem in P-ENSRA approximately and iteratively. Numerical results
show that GP-ENSRA significantly improves the power-delay performance over
ENSRA in the large delay regime. For a wide range of system parameters,
GP-ENSRA reduces the traffic delay over ENSRA by 20~30% under the same power

from any translate of itself. A related question is to characterize for what
couplings $(W,X)$ the mutual information $I(W;Y)$ is close to maximum possible.
To that end we show that in order to saturate the channel, i.e. for $I(W;Y)$ to
approach capacity, it is mandatory that $I(W;X)\to\infty$ (under suitable

deploying high throughput storage clusters, i.e. based on Solid State Disks
(SSDs), as well as optimally consolidating the workloads across storage nodes.
Nowadays, the only practical solution for cloud storage providers to offer
guaranteed performance is to grossly over-provision the storage nodes. The
current workload scheduling mechanisms used in production do not have the
intelligence to optimally allocate block storage volumes based on the
performance of SSDs. In this paper, we introduce Serifos, an autonomous
performance modeling and load balancing system designed for SSD-based cloud
storage. Serifos takes into account the characteristics of the SSD storage
units and constructs hardware dependent workload consolidation models. Thus
Serifos is able to predict the latency caused by workload interference and the
average latency of concurrent workloads. Furthermore, Serifos leverages an I/O
load balancing algorithm to dynamically balance the volumes across the cluster.
Experimental results indicate that Serifos consolidation model is able to
maintain the mean prediction error of around 10% for heterogeneous hardware. As
a result of Serifos load balancing, we found that the variance and the maximum
average latency are reduced by 82% and 52%, respectively. The supported Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) on the testbed improve 43% on average latency, 32% on
the maximum read and 63% on the maximum write latency.

output of this class contributes significantly to the hard X-ray production in
massive stars in the Galaxy. The gamma Cas stars have light curves showing
variability on a few broadly-defined timescales and spectra indicative of an
optically thin plasma consisting of one or more hot thermal components. By now
9--13 Galactic \approx B0-1.5e main sequence stars are judged to be members or
candidate members of the \gamma Cas class. Conservative criteria for this
designation are for a \approxB0-1.5e III-V star to have an X-ray luminosity of
10^{32}--10^{33} ergs s^{-1}, a hot thermal spectrum containing the short
wavelength Ly \alpha FeXXV and FeXXVI lines and the fluorescence FeK feature
all in emission. If thermality cannot be demonstrated, for example from either
the presence of these Ly \alpha lines or curvature of the hard continuum; these
are the gamma Cas candidates. We discuss the history of the discovery of the
complicated characteristics of the variability in the optical, UV, and X-ray
domains, leading to suggestions for the physical cause of the production of
hard X-rays. These include scenarios in which matter from the Be star accretes
onto a degenerate secondary star and interactions between magnetic fields on
the Be star and its decretion disk. The greatest aid to the choice of the
causal mechanism is the temporal correlations of X-ray light curves and spectra
with diagnostics in the optical and UV wavebands. We show why the magnetic
star-disk interaction scenario is the most tenable explanation for the creation
of hard X-rays on these stars.

to identify it from observations. Traditional way for the market graph
identification is to use a simple procedure based on statistical estimations of
Pearson correlations between pairs of stocks. Recently a new class of
statistical procedures for the market graph identification was introduced and
optimality of these procedures in Pearson correlation Gaussian network was
proved. However the obtained procedures have a high reliability only for
Gaussian multivariate distributions of stocks attributes. One of the way to
correct this drawback is to consider a different networks generated by
different measures of pairwise similarity of stocks. A new and promising model
in this context is the sign similarity network. In the present paper the market
graph identification problem in sign similarity network is considered. A new
class of statistical procedures for the market graph identification is
introduced and optimality of these procedures is proved. Numerical experiments
detect essential difference in quality of optimal procedures in sign similarity
and Pearson correlation networks. In particular it is observed that the quality
of optimal identification procedure in sign similarity network is not sensitive
to the assumptions on distribution of stocks attributes.

reroute (cloaking) waves, and typically this is developed for electromagnetic
waves at millimetric down to nanometric scales or for acoustics or thin elastic
plates at centimeter scales. Extending the concepts of Kadic et al. 2013 we
show that the underlying ideas are generic across wave systems and scales by
generalizing these concepts to seismic waves at frequencies, and lengthscales
of the order of hundreds of meters, relevant to civil engineering. By applying
ideas from transformation optics we can manipulate and steer Rayleigh surface
wave solutions of the vector Navier equations of elastodynamics; this is
unexpected as this vector system is, unlike Maxwell's electromagnetic
equations, not form invariant under transformations. As a paradigm of the
conformal geophysics that we are creating, we design a square arrangement of
Luneburg lenses to reroute and then refocus Rayleigh waves around a building
with the dual aim of protection and minimizing the effect on the wavefront
(cloaking) after exiting the lenses. To show that this is practically
realisable we deliberately choose to use material parameters readily available
and this metalens consists of a composite soil structured with buried pillars
made of softer material. The regular lattice of inclusions is homogenized to
give an effective material with a radially varying velocity profile that can be
directly interpreted as a lens refractive index. We develop the theory and then
use full 3D time domain numerical simulations to conclusively demonstrate the
validity of the transformation seismology ideas: we demonstrate, at frequencies
of seismological relevance 3-10 Hz, and for low speed sedimentary soil ($v_s$:
300-500 m/s), that the vibration of a structure is reduced by up to 6 dB at its

of the nature of the atypical behavior and to identifying the sources of the
anomalies. Moreover, we consider the case where the atypical patterns exhibit
on only a small (salient) subset of the very high dimensional feature space.
Individual AD techniques and techniques that detect anomalies using all the
features typically fail to detect such anomalies, but our method can detect
such instances collectively, discover the shared anomalous patterns exhibited
by them, and identify the subsets of salient features. In this paper, we focus
on detecting anomalous topics in a batch of text documents, developing our
algorithm based on topic models. Results of our experiments show that our
method can accurately detect anomalous topics and salient features (words)
under each such topic in a synthetic data set and two real-world text corpora

generation and dynamical amplification of extragalactic magnetic fields through
cosmic times, up to $\mu$Gauss levels reported in nearby galaxy clusters, near
equipartition with kinetic energy of plasma motions and on scales of at least
tens of kiloparsecs, is a major puzzle largely unconstrained by observations. A
dynamo effect converting kinetic flow energy into magnetic energy is often
invoked in that context, however extragalactic plasmas are weakly collisional
(as opposed to magnetohydrodynamic fluids), and whether magnetic-field growth
and sustainment through an efficient turbulent dynamo instability is possible
in such plasmas is not established. Fully kinetic numerical simulations of the
Vlasov equation in a six-dimensional phase space necessary to answer this
question have until recently remained beyond computational capabilities. Here,
we show by means of such simulations that magnetic-field amplification via a
dynamo instability does occur in a stochastically-driven, non-relativistic
subsonic flow of initially unmagnetized collisionless plasma. We also find that
the dynamo self-accelerates and becomes entangled with kinetic instabilities as
magnetization increases. The results suggest that such a plasma dynamo may be
realizable in laboratory experiments, support the idea that intracluster medium
(ICM) turbulence may have significantly contributed to the amplification of
cluster magnetic fields up to near-equipartition levels on a timescale shorter
than the Hubble time, and emphasize the crucial role of multiscale kinetic
physics in high-energy astrophysical plasmas.

significantly lower than that of SFGs in S$+$S pairs. This suggests an
important role for the disc-disc collision in the interaction induced star

physical and chemical properties of the escaping atmosphere. We apply our model
to study four exoplanets, HD\,189733b, HD\,209458b, GJ \,436b, and Kepler-11b.
We found that the total mass loss rates of an exoplanet, which are determined
mainly by the integrated fluxes, are moderately affected by the profiles of the
EUV SED, but the composition and species distributions in the atmosphere can be
dramatically modified by the different profiles of the EUV SED. For exoplanets
with a high hydrodynamic escape parameter ($\lambda$), the amount of atomic
hydrogen produced by photoionization at different altitudes can vary by one to
two orders of magnitude with the variation of stellar EUV SEDs. The effect of
photoionization of H is prominent when the EUV SED is dominated by the
low-energy spectral region (400-900${\AA}$), which pushes the transition of
H/H$^{+}$ to low altitudes. On the contrary, the transitions of H/H$^{+}$ move
to higher altitudes when most photons concentrate in the high-energy spectral
region (50-400${\AA}$). For exoplanets with a low $\lambda$, the lower
temperatures of the atmosphere make many chemical reactions so important that
photoionization alone can no longer determine the composition of the escaping
atmosphere. For HD 189733b, it is possible to explain the time variability of
\lya\ between 2010 and 2011 by a change in the EUV SED of the host K star, yet
invoking only thermal H\,I in the atmosphere.

nuclear recoils such dark matter can give rise to keV electron recoils in

of the dark matter plasma interacting with the Earth is required. This is a
complex system, which is here modelled as a fluid governed by the
magnetohydrodynamic equations. These equations are numerically solved for some
illustrative examples, and implications for direct detection experiments
discussed. In particular, the analysis presented here leaves open the
intriguing possibility that the DAMA annual modulation signal is due primarily
to electron recoils (or even a combination of electron recoils and nuclear
recoils). The importance of diurnal modulation (in addition to annual
modulation) as a means of probing this kind of dark matter is also emphasised.

understanding of molecular delivery to cells in tissue constructs. As
three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs become larger, more intricate, and

dynamics and signaling molecule concentrations throughout the tissue. Diffusion
characteristics present a significant limitation in many engineered tissues,
particularly for avascular tissues and for cells whose viability,
differentiation, or function are affected by concentrations of oxygen and
nutrients. This paper seeks to provide novel analytic solutions for certain
cases of steady-state and non-steady-state diffusion and metabolism in 3D
construct designs (planar, cylindrical, and spherical forms), solutions that
otherwise require mathematical approximations achieved through numerical
methods. This model is applied to cerebral organoids, where it is shown that
limitations in diffusion and organoid size can be partially overcome by
localizing metabolically-active cells to an outer layer in a sphere, a
regionalization process that is known to occur through neuroglial precursor
migration both in organoids and in early brain development. The given
prototypical solutions include a review of metabolic information for many cell
types and can be broadly applied to many forms of tissue constructs. This work
enables researchers to model oxygen and nutrient delivery to cells, predict
cell viability, design constructs with improved diffusion capabilities, and
accurately control molecular concentrations in tissue constructs that may be
used in studying models of development and disease or for conditioning cells to
enhance survival after insults like ischemia or implantation into the body,

overestimate flow or underestimate influence. We isolate why this is the case

address an auxiliary consequence: The proliferation of networks as a now-common

transfer-like entropies, has shoehorned dyadic relationships into our
structural interpretation of the organization and behavior of complex systems.
This interpretation thus fails to include the effects of polyadic dependencies.

semiclassical treatments of the SHE to the non-local dynamical regime. Within a
particle-number conserving approximation, we compute the conductivity,
dielectric function, and spin Hall angle in the small frequency and wave vector
limit. The spin Hall angle is found to decrease with frequency and wave number,
but it remains comparable to its zero-frequency value around the frequency
corresponding to the Drude peak. The plasmon dispersion and linewidth are also
obtained. The extrinsic SHE affects the plasmon dispersion in the long
wavelength limit, but not at large values of the wave number. This result
suggests an explanation for the rather similar plasmonic response measured in
exfoliated graphene, which does not exhibit the SHE, and graphene grown by
chemical vapor deposition, for which a large SHE has been recently reported.

We show that there is no spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the original
soft-wall model. After detailed analysis, we find that in order to realize
chiral symmetry breaking and restoration, both profiles for the scalar
potential and the dilaton field are essential. The scalar potential determines
the possible solution structure of the chiral condensate, except the mass term,
it takes another quartic term for the two-flavor case, and for the three-flavor
case, one has to take into account an extra cubic term due to the t'Hooft
determinant interaction. The profile of the dilaton field reflects the
gluodynamics, which is negative at a certain ultraviolet scale and approaches
positive quadratic behavior at far infrared region. With this set-up, the
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum and its restoration at
finite temperature can be realized perfectly. In the two-flavor case, it gives
a second order chiral phase transition in the chiral limit, while the
transition turns to be a crossover for any finite quark mass. In the case of
three-flavor, the phase transition becomes a first order one in the chiral
limit, while above sufficient large quark mass it turns to be a crossover
again. This scenario agrees exactly with the current understanding on chiral
phase transition from lattice QCD and other effective model studies.

is speculated that the magnetic lines undergo outward deflection movement
during the broken moment, as the line tying effect disappears and the magnetic

this paper, we investigate the sparse multipath channel estimation and decoding

channel estimation only needs to recover the nonzero taps with reduced
complexity. Consider the pilot signals are transmitted through a sparse channel
that has only a few nonzero taps with and without additive white Gaussian
noise, respectively. The exactly and approximately sparse inverse fast Fourier
transform (SIFFT) can be employed for these two cases. The SIFFT-based
algorithm recovers the nonzero channel coefficients and their corresponding
coordinates directly, which is significant to the proposed partial intersection
sphere (PIS) decoding approach. Unlike the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding
that enumerates symbol constellation and estimates the transmitted symbols with
the minimum distance, the PIS decoding first generates the set of possible
transmitted symbols and then chooses the transmitted symbols only from this set
with the minimum distance. The diversity order of the PIS decoding is
determined by not only the number of nonzero taps, but also the coordinates of
nonzero taps, and the bit error rate (BER) is also influenced by vector block
size to some extent but roughly independent of the maximum time delay.
Simulation results indicate that by choosing appropriate sphere radius, the BER
performance of the PIS decoding outperforms the conventional zero-forcing
decoding and minimum mean square error decoding, and approximates to the ML
decoding with the increase of signal-to-noise ratio, but reduces the

belong to a ball, with respect to total variation distance metric, centered at
a known nominal controlled conditional distribution with radius $R\in [0,2]$,
in which the minimization is over the control strategies and the maximization
is over conditional distributions. Upon performing the maximization, a dynamic
programming equation is obtained which includes, in addition to the standard
terms, the oscillator semi-norm of the cost-to-go. First, the dynamic
programming equation is analyzed for finite state and control spaces. We show
that if the nominal controlled process distribution is irreducible, then for
every stationary Markov control policy the maximizing conditional distribution
of the controlled process is also irreducible for $R \in [0,R_{max}]$. Second,
the generalized dynamic programming is analyzed for Borel spaces. We derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for any control strategy to be optimal.
Through our analysis, new dynamic programming equations and new policy
iteration algorithms are derived. The main feature of the new policy iteration
algorithms (which are applied for finite alphabet spaces) is that the policy
evaluation and policy improvement steps are performed by using the maximizing
conditional distribution, which is obtained via a water filling solution.
Finally, the application of the new dynamic programming equations and the
corresponding policy iteration algorithms are shown via illustrative examples.

high responsivity and weak signal detection are required. Here, we present high
responsivity phototransistors based on few-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS2).
Depending on the back gate voltage, source drain bias and incident optical
light intensity, the maximum attainable photoresponsivity can reach as high as

of trap states in the few-layer ReS2 flakes. It further enables the detection
of weak signals, as successfully demonstrated with weak light sources including
a lighter and limited fluorescent lighting. Our studies underscore ReS2 as a

The subject of tractability is concerned with the dependence of the worst-case
integration error on the dimension. Roughly speaking, an integration problem is
tractable if the worst-case error does not explode exponentially with the
dimension. Many classical problems are known to be intractable. However,
sometimes tractability can be shown. Often such proofs are based on randomly
selected integration nodes. Of course, in applications true random numbers are
not available and hence one mimics them with pseudorandom number generators.
This motivates us to propose the use of pseudorandom vectors as underlying
integration nodes in order to achieve tractability. In particular, we consider
digital inverse vectors and present two examples of problems, the weighted star
discrepancy and integration of H\""older continuous, absolute convergent
Fourier- and cosine series, where the proposed method is successful.

rotation velocity (related to Zonal Flows). For this purpose, we study a large
number of discharges in two magnetic configurations, corresponding to 'fast'

prior to the transition is associated with the gradual reduction of magnetic
oscillations. The transition itself is marked by a strong spike of 'information
transfer' from magnetic to velocity oscillations, suggesting that the magnetic
drive may play a role in setting up the final sheared flow responsible for the
H-mode transport barrier. Similar observations were made for the 'fast'

rational surfaces play an important and active role in confinement transitions,
so that electromagnetic effects should be included in any complete transition

eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of linear operators associated

insight into the system's behavior are the Perron-Frobenius operator and the
Koopman operator. Due to the curse of dimensionality, computing the
eigenfunctions of high-dimensional systems is in general infeasible. We will
propose a tensor-based reformulation of two numerical methods for computing
finite-dimensional approximations of the aforementioned infinite-dimensional
operators, namely Ulam's method and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD).
The aim of the tensor formulation is to approximate the eigenfunctions by
low-rank tensors, potentially resulting in a significant reduction of the time
and memory required to solve the resulting eigenvalue problems, provided that
such a low-rank tensor decomposition exists. Typically, not all variables of a
high-dimensional dynamical system contribute equally to the system's behavior,
often the dynamics can be decomposed into slow and fast processes, which is
also reflected in the eigenfunctions. Thus, the weak coupling between different
variables might be approximated by low-rank tensor cores. We will illustrate
the efficiency of the tensor-based formulation of Ulam's method and EDMD using
simple stochastic differential equations.

traditional secure communications, secrecy wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) carries several distinct characteristics. On one hand,
wireless power transfer may increase the vulnerability of eavesdropping, since
a power receiver, as a potential eavesdropper, usually has a shorter access
distance than an information receiver. On the other hand, wireless power
transfer can be exploited to enhance wireless security. This article reviews
the security issues in various SWIPT scenarios, with an emphasis on revealing
the corresponding challenges and opportunities for implementing SWIPT.
Furthermore, we provide a survey on a variety of physical layer security

transfer efficiency and secure information transmission simultaneously.

satisfying an integrability condition. We focus our analysis on the properties
of the generalised principal eigenvalue $\lambda\_p(\mathcal{L}\_{\Omega}+a)$
defined by $$\lambda\_p(\mathcal{L}\_{\Omega}+a):= \sup\{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}

For kernels $K$ of the type, $K(x,y)=J(x-y)$ with $J$ a compactly supported

the $\ln T$ anomaly of the Kondo effect have been studied to cover the whole
region from the magnetic ordering regime at low pressure to the Fermi liquid
regime at high pressure. $T_{N}$ initially increases with increasing pressure,
and starts to decrease at high pressure as expected from the Doniach's diagram.
Simultaneously, the $\ln T$ behavior in the resistivity is enhanced, indicating
the enhancement of the Kondo effect by pressure. It is also characteristic in
CeX$_{c}$ that the crystal field splitting rapidly decreases at a common rate
of $-12.2$ K/GPa. This leads to the increase in the degeneracy of the $f$ state

anthropogenic and natural forcings is a key contemporary scientific challenge.
Using a simplified and efficient open-source general circulation model of the
atmosphere featuring O($10^5$) degrees of freedom, we show how it is possible
to approach such a problem using nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Response
theory allows one to practically compute the time-dependent measure supported
on the pullback attractor of the climate system, whose dynamics is
non-autonomous as a result of time-dependent forcings. We propose a simple yet
efficient method for predicting - at any lead time and in an ensemble sense -
the change in climate properties resulting from increase in the concentration
of CO$_2$ using test perturbation model runs. We assess strengths and
limitations of the response theory in predicting the changes in the globally
averaged values of surface temperature and of the yearly total precipitation,
as well as in their spatial patterns. The quality of the predictions obtained
for the surface temperature fields is rather good, while in the case of
precipitation a good skill is observed only for the global average. We also
show how it is possible to define accurately concepts like the the inertia of
the climate system or to predict when climate change is detectable given a
scenario of forcing. Our analysis can be extended for dealing with more complex
portfolios of forcings and can be adapted to treat, in principle, any climate
observable. Our conclusion is that climate change is indeed a problem that can
be effectively seen through a statistical mechanical lens, and that there is
great potential for optimizing the current coordinated modelling exercises run

in the initially excited small-size (donor) nanocrystals participate in the
dipole-dipole FRET leading to additional excitation of the large-size
(acceptor) nanocrystals. The FRET becomes possible due to the weak admixture of
the bright exciton states to the dark states. The admixture takes place even in
zero magnetic field and allows the radiative recombination of the dark
excitons. An external magnetic field considerably enhances this admixture, thus
increasing the energy transfer rate by a factor of 2-3 in a field of 15T, as
well as the radiative rates of the dark excitons in the donor and acceptor
nanocrystals. The theoretical modeling allows us to determine the spectral
dependence of the probability for the NC to serve as a donor for larger

remain invariant if a constant is added to the Lagrangian. In the conventional
approach, gravitational theories break this symmetry exhibited by all other
physical systems. Restoring this symmetry to gravity and demanding that
gravitational field equations should also remain invariant under the addition
of a constant to a Lagrangian, leads to the interpretation of gravity as the
thermodynamic limit of the kinetic theory of atoms of space. This approach
selects, in a very natural fashion, Einstein's general relativity in $d=4$.
Developing this paradigm at a deeper level, one can obtain the distribution
function for the atoms of space and connect it up with the thermodynamic
description of spacetime. This extension relies on a curious fact that the
quantum spacetime endows each event with a finite area but zero volume. This
approach allows us determine the numerical value of the cosmological constant
and suggests a new perspective on cosmology.

Coarse-grained dynamics from microscopic transport calculations of the

specific manners in the measurable dilepton invariant mass spectra and in the
photon transverse momentum spectra. However, as the many influences are
difficult to disentangle, we argue that the challenge for future measurements
of electromagnetic probes will be to provide a high precision with
uncertainties much lower than in previous experiments. Furthermore, a
systematic study of the whole energy range covered by CBM at FAIR and RHIC-BES

CCSD(T-$n$) series [J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)], in which not only the
CCSD amplitude, but also the CCSD multiplier equations are satisfied at the

both are term-wise size extensive with a formal convergence towards the CCSDT

utilized than for the E-CCSD(T-$n$) series. The present analysis can be
generalized to any perturbation expansion representing the difference between a
parent CC model and a higher-level target CC model. In general, we demonstrate
that, whenever the parent parameters depend upon the perturbation operator, a
perturbation expansion of the CC energy (where only parent amplitudes are used)
differs from a perturbation expansion of the CC Lagrangian (where both parent

positive perpendicular electric field induced hole doping increases the energy
of CCDW, so that the system transforms to NCCDW or similar metastable state. On
the other hand, even the CCDW distortion is more stable upon in-plain electric
field induced electron injection, some accompanied effects can drive the system
to cross over the energy barrier from CCDW to nearly commensurate (NC) CDW or
similar metastable state. We also estimate that hole doping can introduce
potential superconductivity with $T_{c}$ of $6\sim7$ K. Controllable switching

account both local and global gestalt laws. The model is compatible with the
functional architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1). Particularly the
local gestalt law of good continuity is described by means of suitable
connectivity kernels, that are derived from Lie group theory and are neurally
implemented in long range connectivity in V1. Different kernels are compatible
with the geometric structure of cortical connectivity and they are derived as
the fundamental solutions of the Fokker Planck, the Sub-Riemannian Laplacian
and the isotropic Laplacian equations. The kernels are used to construct
matrices of connectivity among the features present in a visual stimulus.
Global gestalt constraints are then introduced in terms of spectral analysis of
the connectivity matrix, showing that this processing can be cortically
implemented in V1 by mean field neural equations. This analysis performs
grouping of local features and individuates perceptual units with the highest
saliency. Numerical simulations are performed and results are obtained applying
the technique to a number of stimuli.

the current density for a charged scalar field in the region between two
co-dimension one branes on the background of locally AdS spacetime with an
arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. Along compact
dimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of the
phases and on the branes Robin boundary conditions are imposed for the field
operator. In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge field. The
latter gives rise to Aharonov-Bohm type effect on the vacuum currents. There
exists a range in the space of the Robin coefficients for separate branes where
the vacuum state becomes unstable. Compared to the case of the standard AdS
bulk, in models with compact dimensions the stability condition imposed on the
parameters is less restrictive. The current density has nonzero components
along compact dimensions only. These components are decomposed into the
brane-free and brane-induced contributions. The component along a given compact
dimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by that
dimension, with the period of the flux quantum. An important feature, that
distinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the field
squared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes. In
particular, for Dirichlet boundary condition the current density vanishes on
the branes. We show that, depending on the constants in the boundary
conditions, the presence of the branes may either increase or decrease the
current density compared with that for the brane-free geometry. Applications
are given to the Randall--Sundrum 2-brane model with extra compact dimensions.

nanoparticle arrays exhibits nonlinear I-V characteristics, where the level of
nonlinearity strongly associates with the array's architecture. Here, we use
different mathematical approaches to quantify collective behavior in the charge
transport inside the sample and its relationship to the structural
characteristics of the assembly and the presence of charge disorder. In
particular, we simulate single-electron tunneling conduction in several
assemblies with controlled variation of the structural components (branching,
extended linear segments) that influence the local communication among the
conducting paths between the electrodes. Furthermore, by applying the fractal
analysis of time series of the number of tunnelings and the technique of
algebraic topology, we unravel the temporal correlations and structure of the
phase-space manifolds corresponding to the cooperative fluctuations of charge.
By tracking the I-V curves in different assemblies together with the indicators
of collective dynamics and topology of manifolds in the state space, we show
that the increased I-V nonlinearity is fully consistent with the enhanced
aggregate fluctuations and topological complexity of the participating states.
The architecture that combines local branching and global topological disorder
enables the creation of large drainage basins of nano-rivers leading to
stronger cooperation effects. Also, by determining shifts in the topology and
collective transport features, we explore the impact of the size of electrodes
and local charge disorder. The results are relevant for designing the
nanoparticle devices with improved conduction; they also highlight the
significance of topological descriptions for a broader understanding of the
nature of fluctuations at the nanoscale.

is due to the fact that they provide the link between analysis on singular
spaces and operator algebras. The groupoids integrating Lie manifolds play an
important background role in establishing this link because they provide
operator algebras whose structure is often well understood. The initial
motivation for the work surveyed here--work that spans over close to two
decades--was to develop the index theory of stratified singular spaces.
Meanwhile, several other applications have emerged as well, including
applications to Partial Differential Equations and Numerical Methods. These
will be mentioned only briefly, however, due to the lack of space. Instead, we
shall concentrate on the applications to Index theory.

the control plane and separating it from the data plane. The separation of

the difference in processing packets at each plane allows an adversary to
fingerprint the network's packet-forwarding logic. In this paper, we study the
feasibility of fingerprinting the controller-switch interactions by a remote
adversary, whose aim is to acquire knowledge about specific flow rules that are
installed at the switches. This knowledge empowers the adversary with a better
understanding of the network's packet-forwarding logic and exposes the network
to a number of threats. In our study, we collect measurements from hosts
located across the globe using a realistic SDN network comprising of OpenFlow
hardware and software switches. We show that, by leveraging information from
the RTT and packet-pair dispersion of the exchanged packets, fingerprinting
attacks on SDN networks succeed with overwhelming probability. We also show
that these attacks are not restricted to active adversaries, but can be equally
mounted by passive adversaries that only monitor traffic exchanged with the SDN
network. Finally, we discuss the implications of these attacks on the security
of SDN networks, and we present and evaluate an efficient countermeasure to
strengthen SDN networks against fingerprinting. Our results demonstrate the

by a reduction of the problem based on liquid relaxation time $\tau$
representing non-perturbative treatment of strong interactions. On the basis of

recent experiments. We demonstrate how these modes can be derived by
generalizing either hydrodynamic or elasticity equations. We comment on the

evolve with temperature and how this affects liquid energy and other properties

interconnecting their sites so that they can exchange information. For these
overlay networks to preserve their functionality, they should be able to
recover from various problems like membership changes or faults. Various
self-stabilizing overlay networks have already been proposed in recent years,
which have the advantage of being able to recover from any illegal state, but
none of these networks can give any guarantees on its functionality while the
recovery process is going on. We initiate research on overlay networks that are
not only self-stabilizing but that also ensure that searchability is maintained
while the recovery process is going on, as long as there are no corrupted
messages in the system. More precisely, once a search message from node $u$ to
another node $v$ is successfully delivered, all future search messages from $u$
to $v$ succeed as well. We call this property monotonic searchability. We show
that in general it is impossible to provide monotonic searchability if
corrupted messages are present in the system, which justifies the restriction
to system states without corrupted messages. Furthermore, we provide a
self-stabilizing protocol for the line for which we can also show monotonic
searchability. It turns out that even for the line it is non-trivial to achieve
this property. Additionally, we extend our protocol to deal with node
departures in terms of the Finite Departure Problem of Foreback et. al (SSS

that to satisfy the constraints on the precision parameters at $99 \%$ [$95

properties of the solutions of the truncated Dyson-Schwinger equation for the

are analysed in some detail. In Euclidean space within the Matsubara imaginary
time formalism the quark propagator is not longer a O(4) symmetric function and
possesses a discrete spectra of the fourth component of the momentum. This
makes the treatment of the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations
conceptually different from the vacuum and technically much more involved. The
question whether the interaction kernel known from vacuum calculations can be
applied at finite temperatures remains still open. We find that, at low
temperatures, the model interaction with vacuum parameters provides a
reasonable description of the quark propagator, while at temperatures higher
than a certain critical value $T_c$ the interaction requires stringent
modifications. The general properties of the quark propagator at finite
temperatures can be inferred from lattice QCD calculations. We argue that, to
achieve a reasonable agreement of the model calculations with that from lattice
QCD, the kernel is to be modified in such a way as to screen the infra-red part
of the interaction at temperatures larger than $T_c$. For this, we analyse the
solutions of the truncated Dyson-Schwinger equation with existing interaction
kernels in a large temperature range with particular attention on high
temperatures in order to find hints to an adequate temperature dependence of
the interaction kernel to be further implemented in to the Bethe-Salpeter

a retailer bidding to an operational electricity market by using the proposed
algorithm. This technique becomes more needful when the power grid accommodates
a large number of intermittent energy resources wherein RT demand altering is

quantum Ising model. Using the method, we are able to treat the system of
arbitrarily large finite size (for example 10000 x 10000 lattice). We clearly
demonstrate that the density of Floquet quasi-energy spectrum tends to a flat

However, contrary to the prediction of random matrices of the circular
orthogonal ensemble, the decay rates of the Fourier coefficients of the Floquet
level density exhibit rich and non-trivial dependence on the system's
parameters. Remarkably, we find that the method is renormalizable and gives
thermodynamically convergent results only in certain regions of the parameter
space where the corner transfer matrices have effectively a finite rank for any
system size. In the complementary regions, the corner transfer matrices
effectively become of full rank and the method becomes non-renormalizable. This
may indicate an interesting phase transition from an area- to volume- law of

prevented from reaching the edge of the spatial simulation volume, enabling the
long-time evolution of wave packets with a relatively small number of basis
functions without concerns of electron reflections. On the other hand, the
bound-state components are free from shrinking toward the origin because of
non-time scaling in the inner region. Hence, the equations of motion in ETS are
less stiff than the ones in the original time-scaled coordinate approach in
which the shrinking bound states make the equations of motion seriously stiff.
For numerical implementation of ETS, the working equations are derived in terms
of finite-element discrete-variable-representation functions. Furthermore, the
stiffness-free Lanczos time propagator is introduced to remove any persistent
stiffness in the treatment of mid-IR lasers due to the involvement of hundreds
of angular-momentum states. The test calculations for atomic hydrogen
interacting with linearly polarized mid-IR pulses demonstrate the accuracy and
numerical efficiency of the new scheme, and exhibit its special capability if
there is no recollision with the parent ion. Hence, ETS will show its true
potential for the detailed analysis of photoelectron wave packet dynamics in
circularly or near-circularly polarized mid-IR fields.

dissipation/propagation of MHD waves. We investigate the effects of the
isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation characteristics of
the MHD waves in NPCH. We first model NPCH by considering the differences in
radial as well as in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight
(\textit{los}) in temperature, particle number density and non-thermal
velocities between plumes and interplume lanes for the specific case of
\ion{O}{VI} ions. This model includes parallel and perpendicular (to the
magnetic field) heat conduction and viscous dissipation. Next, we derive the
dispersion relations for the MHD waves in the case of absence and presence of
parallel heat conduction. In the case of absence of parallel heat conduction,
we find that MHD wave dissipation strongly depends on the viscosity for
modified acoustic and Alfven waves. The energy flux density of acoustic waves
varies between $10^{4.7}$ and $10^7 \,erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ while the energy
flux density of Alfven waves turned out to be between $ 10^6-10^{8.6}
\,erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$. But, solutions of the magnetoacustic waves show that
the parallel heat conduction introduce anomalous dispersion to the NPCH plasma
wherein the group velocity of waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum. Our
results suggests all these waves may provide significant source for the
observed preferential accelerating and heating of \ion{O}{VI} ions, in turn
coronal plasma heating and an extra accelerating agent for fast solar wind in
NPCH.

Szemer\'edi-Trotter type implications of the arithmetic estimates in question

collinear triples of points in $P$, $\gg n^{3/2}$ distinct lines between pairs
of its points, in $\gg n^{3/4}$ distinct directions.
  Besides, $P=A\times A$ determines $\gg n^{9/16}$ distinct pair-wise

parameters from CMB data without use of likelihood approximations. It builds on
a previously developed Gibbs sampling framework that allows for exploration of
the joint CMB sky signal and power spectrum posterior, P(s,Cl|d), and addresses
a long-standing problem of efficient parameter estimation simultaneously in
high and low signal-to-noise regimes. To achieve this, our new algorithm
introduces a joint Markov Chain move in which both the signal map and power
spectrum are synchronously modified, by rescaling the map according to the
proposed power spectrum before evaluating the Metropolis-Hastings accept
probability. Such a move was already introduced by Jewell et al. (2009), who
used it to explore low signal-to-noise posteriors. However, they also found
that the same algorithm is inefficient in the high signal-to-noise regime,
since a brute-force rescaling operation does not account for phase information.
This problem is mitigated in the new algorithm by subtracting the Wiener filter
mean field from the proposed map prior to rescaling, leaving high
signal-to-noise information invariant in the joint step, and effectively only
rescaling the low signal-to-noise component. To explore the full posterior, the
new joint move is then interleaved with a standard conditional Gibbs sky map
move. We apply our new algorithm to simplified simulations for which we can
evaluate the exact posterior to study both its accuracy and performance, and
find good agreement with the exact posterior; marginal means agree to less than
0.006 sigma, and standard deviations to better than 3%. The Markov Chain
correlation length is of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by other
standard samplers in the field.

problem for the Sasa-Satsuma(SS) equation on the finite interval. Assume that
the solution existes, we show that this solution can be expressed in terms of
the solution of a $3\times 3$ Riemann-Hilbert problem. The relevant jump
matrices are explicitly given in terms of the three matrix-value spectral
functions $s(k)$, $S(k)$ and $S_L(k)$, which in turn are defined in terms of
the initial values, boundary values at $x=0$ and boundary values at $x=L$,
respectively. However, for a well-posed problem, only part of the boundary
values can be prescribed, the remaining boundary data cannot be independently
specified, but are determined by the so-called global relation. Here, we
analyze the global relation to characterize the unknown boundary values in
terms of the given initial and boundary data.

that the transformation may be ill-conditioned. Moreover, when applied to the

competing interactions, of the Coulomb repulsion and the itineracy of the
d-electrons, opening a possibility of building new quantum ground states.
Particularly the 5d metal oxides containing Iridium have received significant
attention within the last years, due to their unexpected physical properties,
caused by a strong spin orbit coupling observed in Ir(IV). A prominent example
is the Mott-insulator Sr2IrO4. Another member of this family, the honeycomb
lattice compound Na2IrO3, also being a Mott-insulator having, most probably, a
Kitaev spin liquid ground state. By deintercalating sodium from Na2IrO3, we
were able to synthesize a new honeycomb lattice compound with more than 50%
reduced sodium content. The reduction of the sodium content in this layered
compound leads to a change of the oxidation state of iridium from +IV to +V/+VI
and a symmetry change from C2/c to P-3. This goes along with significant
changes of the physical properties. Besides the vanishing magnetic ordering at
15K, also the transport properties changes and instead insulating
semiconducting properties are observed.

that filamentary molecular clouds are ubiquitous along the Galactic plane.
These structures are inhomogeneous, with over-densities that are sometimes
associated with infrared emission and active of star formation. To investigate
the connection between filaments and star formation, requires an understanding
of the processes that lead to the fragmentation of filaments and a
determination of the physical properties of the over-densities (clumps). In
this paper, we present a multi-wavelength study of five filamentary molecular
clouds, containing several clumps in different evolutionary stages of star
formation. We analyse the fragmentation of the filaments and derive the
physical properties of their clumps. We find that the clumps in all filaments
have a characteristic spacing consistent with the prediction of the `sausage'
instability theory, regardless of the complex morphology of the filaments or
their evolutionary stage. We also find that most clumps have sufficient mass
and density to form high-mass stars, supporting the idea that high-mass stars

the rich set of absorption features seen in the Chandra data, we identify two
warm absorbers with column densities and ionisations that are consistent with
being constant on both short and long time-scales, suggesting that those are
the signature of a rather homogeneous and extended outflow. A third absorber,
ionised to a lesser degree, is also present and it replaces the strictly
neutral absorber that is ubiquitously inferred from the X-ray analysis of
obscured Compton-thin sources. This colder absorber appears to vary in column
density on long time-scales, suggesting a non-homogeneous absorber. Moreover,
its ionisation responds to the nuclear luminosity variations on time-scales as
short as a few days, indicating that the absorber is in photoionisation
equilibrium with the nuclear source on these time-scales. All components are
consistent with being co-spatial and located between the inner and outer edges
of the so-called dusty, clumpy torus. Assuming co-spatiality, the three phases
also share the same pressure, suggesting that the warm / hot phases confine the
colder, most likely clumpy, medium. We discuss further the properties of the

is shown that this algebraic polynomial formulation can be naturally extended

commuting projection operators and the truth values, which take the binary
values {0,1}, are the respective eigenvalues. In this view the solution of a
logical proposition resulting from the operation on a combination of arguments
will appear as a selection where the outcome can only be one of the
eigenvalues. In this way propositional logic can be formalized in linear
algebra by using elective developments which correspond here to combinations of
tensored elementary projection operators. The original and principal motivation

Extensive experiments show that GTF outperforms existing systems, even ones

of cross sections in hard exclusive reactions with large scattering angles, and
it enables us to determine the number of elementary constituents inside

of the elementary constituents is consistent with $n_{\gamma} = 1$, $n_{p} =
3$, $n_{K^{+}} = 2$, and $n_{\Lambda} = n_{\Sigma ^{0}} = 3$. Then, the
analysis is made for the photoproductions of the hyperon resonances $\Lambda

considered to be a $\bar K N$ molecule and hence its constituent number could
be five. However, we find that the current data are not enough to conclude the
numbers of their constituent. It is necessary to investigate the higher-energy
region at $\sqrt{s} > 2.8$ GeV experimentally beyond the energy of the
available CLAS data for counting the number of constituents clearly. We also
mention that our results indicate energy dependence in the constituent number,

three-quark and five-quark states, the energy dependence of the scaling

the edges inside the image. One solution to reduce the above mentioned noises
is using some kind of filters. Filtering the noise before/after/between the

the resolution of the reconstructed images. The filtered image is often applied
to the image automation for examples image segmentation or image registration

reduced the artifacts and noise introduced from filtered back-projection method

the selected events is obtained from the Observational Gravitational Lensing

the events brighter compared to using the logarithmic magnitude, with an
average of about $3.42 \times10^{-2}$ magnitude and the average of the

advantage over geostatistical methods as the latter requires variogram study
and statistical expertise. Moreover, RBFs can be used for scattered data
interpolation with very good convergence, which makes them desirable for shape
function interpolation in meshless methods for numerical solution of partial
differential equations. For interpolation of large data sets, however, RBFs in
their usual form, lead to solving an ill-conditioned system of equations, for
which, a small error in the data can cause a significantly large error in the
interpolated solution. In order to reduce this limitation, we propose a hybrid
kernel by using the conventional Gaussian and a shape parameter independent
cubic kernel. Global particle swarm optimization method has been used to
analyze the optimal values of the shape parameter as well as the weight
coefficients controlling the Gaussian and the cubic part in the hybridization.
Through a series of numerical tests, we demonstrate that such hybridization
stabilizes the interpolation scheme by yielding a far superior implementation
compared to those obtained by using only the Gaussian or cubic kernels. The
proposed kernel maintains the accuracy and stability at small shape parameter
as well as relatively large degrees of freedom, which exhibit its potential for
scattered data interpolation and intrigues its application in global as well as
local meshless methods for numerical solution of PDEs.

texture can be considered as an archetype for many natural or artificial human
structures. The paper properties are correlated with its texture by taking
account the effect of chance occurring during its manufacturing process. The
theoretical developments, the formalism and the application methods presented
in this study have a general significance beyond the only paper material.A
specific property of sets of objects randomly unorderly distributed in space is
their interfaces orientation distribution. This distribution is usually
obtained by the analysis of images sampled in the object sets. The density of
orientation probability of the fibers or of the texture interfaces, weighted by
their length or by their area, can be interpreted as the radius of curvature of
an outline or of a warped surface which characterizes, from a global and
statistical point of view, the texture geometry in two or three dimensions.
This figure named by the author the ""equivalent pore"", is with its elliptical
shape similar to the one of the mean pore defined by the mean directional chord
between the interfaces in the texture. Different methods of ""equivalent pore""
establishing are analyzed : by conformal map of the fiber network or of the
texture interfaces, by images stereometric analysis of texture tomographical
cuts, by scattering and diffraction of a laser light beam impacting the fibrous
texture or the material surface replica, by hard X-ray absorption and phase
contrast at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities(ESRF), in Grenoble.
The ""equivalent pore"" concept allows us to study random unordered sets behavior
in strength fields while simplifying this analysis. Thus a phenomenon occurring
in a plane set, in two dimensions, can be analyzed on its ""equivalent pore""
linear outline, and a phenomenon which occurs in volume in a three dimensional
set can be analyzed on its ""equivalent pore"" warped surface. This concept has
been applied for physical, mechanical, optical and ionic conduction properties
of materials like papers, boards, felts, nonwoven textiles, polymer foams,
metallic alloys with grain joints, geological grounds, and for the surface
mapping of natural relief and of materials with different gloss, worn or
roughness levels.The ellipse and the ellipso\""id, as well as multi-modes
compositions of it, are the most appropriate figures to represent the
""equivalent pore"" of materials with a random unordered texture. The fact that a
law, which defines the curvature of an elliptic deterministic geometrical
configuration, is essential to represent interface orientation allocation of
elements whose spatial distribution is probabilistic is a noteworthy fact that
makes us wonder. This assertion is corroborated by fluid flow analysis through
porous media. The global dissipated energy for fluid flow is distributed along
the motion (translation and rotation) and fluid deformation components on the
""equivalent pore"" whose surface is conformal to the texture interfaces
tangential space. The porous media being homogenous and the fluid particles
indistinguishable each ones from the others, due to permanent stochastic
exchanges from one fluid volume element into another, we conclude that their
motion quantification is invariant on each point of the ""equivalent pore""
surface. This quantification can be represented by a group of elliptical
cylinders.The ""equivalent pore"" and cylinders group surface intersections
define the fluid particle probabilistic paths in the porous media. One singular
geometrical configuration of the elliptic cylinders group union with the
ellipsoidal ""equivalent pore"" fulfills the minimal energy dissipation
requirements in the stress field applied to the fluid. The resulting paths are
ellipso\""ido-cylindrical curves carpeting the ellipso\""id by a beam of
isoperim\'etric lacets, in close or open loops depending on the possible
pairing off the curves in their nodals and isoclinal tangency points. The flow
laminarity and unrotationality are globally established in the porous media at
the macroscopic scale, for Reynold's number small values, in agreement with the
results found moreover. The so defined ellipso\""ido-cylindrical curve is a
stationary curve at the average least action meaning, for a punctual mobile or
a deformable volume element moving on the surface of the ellipsoid from a nodal
spot to the other in an antipodal position. This curve establishes a gauge
which characterizes, from a global point of view, the physical space embraced
by the fluid during its flow, in dynamical balance conditions compatible with
the stress field. The ellipso\""ido-cylindrical curve allows to carpet the
ellipso\""id as a function of one cyclic angular variable, which is a new
construction for the ellipso\""id. When the set of the objects is isotropic the
curve is sphero-cylindrical whose plan mapping permit to decipher the tai-chi
figure of the Tao\""ist Buddhism philosophy.This study of random unordered
object sets, and more specially of fibrous porous media, allows to establish a
structural link between their small scale texture stochastic disorder and the
harmonious order that emerges from these sets at a larger scale. The largest
chance possible, compatible with the stress field which put a strain on these
sets, is the necessary and sufficient variable which allows to best globally
adjust their behaviors according to the probabilistic and deterministic laws
governing their evolution.The vocabulary used in this study is issued from the
common language, most of the time adapted to the material class, it is
transposable in other fields of interest. The text is completed by notes and a
bibliography which refer to the works done following the presented concepts or
in relation to this field of studies.

This modeling yields an interpretation of the control and delay of drug

mass ordering, the theoretical value of $\theta_{13}$ is predicted as

predicted as $\theta_{13}=9.7^\circ$, which is far from the current global best

leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ can be obtained by fine tuning.
Without fine tuning, $|\sin\delta_{\rm CP}|$ should be very small, typically of
${\cal O}(\lambda^2)$ where $\lambda\equiv \sin\theta_{\rm C}$. Furthermore, a
model-independent measure of CP violation is proposed, which is applicable to
any flavor models.

  Experiments and modeling",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the impact of holding umbrella on the uni- and bi-directional
flow has been investigated via experiment and modeling. In the experiments,
pedestrians are required to walk clockwise/anti-clockwise in a ring-shaped
corridor under normal situation and holding umbrella situation. No matter in
uni- or bi-directional flow, the flow rate under holding umbrella situation
decreases comparing with that in normal situation. In bidirectional flow,
pedestrians segregate into two opposite moving streams very quickly under
normal situation, and clockwise/anti-clockwise walking pedestrians are always
in the inner/outer lane due to right-walking preference. Under holding umbrella
situation, spontaneous lane formation has also occurred. However, when holding
umbrella, pedestrians may separate into more than two lanes. Moreover, the
merge of lanes have been observed, and clockwise/anti-clockwise pedestrians are
not always in the inner/outer lane. To model the flow dynamics, an improved
force-based model has been proposed. The contact force between umbrellas has
been taken into account. Simulation results are in agreement with the
experimental ones.
