solvent are investigated by applying a given force $F$ to a point of the knot
while keeping another point fixed. The Monte Carlo sampling of the polymer
conformations on a simple cubic lattice is performed using a variant of the
Wang-Landau algorithm. The results of the calculations of the specific energy,
specific heat capacity and gyration radius for several knot topologies show a
general trend in the behavior of short polymer knots with lengths up to seventy
lattice units. At low tensile force $F$, knots can be found either in a compact
or an extended phase, depending if the temperature is low or high. At any
temperature, with increasing values of the force $F$, a polymer knot undergoes
a phase transition to a stretched state. This transition is characterized by a
strong peak in the heat capacity. There is also a minor peak, which corresponds
to a transition occurring at low temperatures when the conformations of
polymers in the stretched phase become swollen with increasing temperatures. It
is also shown that the behavior of short polymer rings is strongly influenced
by topological effects. The limitations in the number of accessible energy
states due to topological constraints is particularly evident in knots of small
size and such that their minimum number of crossing according to the Rolfsen
knot table is high. An example is provided by a cinquefoil knot $5_1$ with a
length of only fifty lattice units. The thermal and mechanical properties of
knots that can be represented with diagrams having the same minimum number of
crossings, are very similar. The size effects on the behavior of polymer knots
have been analyzed too. Surprisingly, it is found that topological effects fade
out very fast with increasing polymer length.

It is found that in zero magnetic fields and in near-critical fields, when the
size of the superconducting gap can be neglected, the position of the peaks in

split. For PC with diameters greater than or on the order of the coherence

  Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $\nu$ be a partition of $n$. Let $F$ be
the Ferrers diagram of $\nu$. Let $m$ be a positive integer and let $p \in
(0,1)$. Fill each cell of $F$ with balls, the number of which is independently
drawn from the random variable $X = Bin(m,p)$. Given non-negative integers $j$
and $t$, let $P(\nu,j,t)$ be the probability that the total number of balls in
$F$ is $j$ and that no row of $F$ contains more that $t$ balls. We show that if
$\nu$ and $\mu$ are partitions of $n$, then $\nu$ dominates $\mu$, i.e.
$\sum_{i=1}^k \nu(i) \geq \sum_{i=1}^k \mu(i)$ for all positive integers $k$,
if and only if $P(\nu,j,t) \leq P(\mu,j,t)$ for all non-negative integers $j$
and $t$. It is also shown that this same result holds when $X$ is replaced by
any one member of a large class of random variables.
  Let $p = \{p_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of real numbers. Let ${\cal
T}_p$ be the $\mathbb{N}$ by $\mathbb{N}$ matrix with $({\cal T}_p)_{i,j} =
p_{j-i}$ for all $i, j \in \mathbb{N}$ where we take $p_n = 0$ for $n < 0$. Let
$(p^i)_j$ be the coefficient of $x^j$ in $(p(x))^i$ where $p(x) =

(van Seijen & Sutton, 2014). These new versions maintain an exact equivalence
with the forward view at all times, whereas the traditional versions only
approximate it for small step-sizes. We hypothesize that these true online

TD($\lambda$)/Sarsa($\lambda$) on random MRPs, a real-world myoelectric

online methods are often better, but never worse than that of the regular
methods. An additional advantage is that no choice between traces has to be
made for the true online methods. Besides the empirical results, we provide an
in-depth analysis of the theory behind true online temporal-difference

predicted. The excitation spectra in the plane-wave phase and the zero-momentum
phase show rich roton-maxon structures, and their instabilities indicate the

it compresses the components of the level sets of a multivariate mapping and
obtains a summary representation of their relationships. A related construction

support its use in practical data analysis. Using tools from category theory,
we formally prove the convergence between the Reeb space and mapper in terms of
an interleaving distance between their categorical representations. Given a

converge to the Reeb space in the interleaving distance; this also helps to
quantify the approximation quality of the discretization at a fixed resolution.

author earlier. In this model, the effective cosmological term is proportional
to the Hubble parameter squared through the so-called kinematic induction. The
reason of studying this cosmological model could be explained by its ability to
describe two periods of accelerated expansion, that is in agreement with the
recent observations and the cosmological inflation paradigm. First of all, we
put our model through the theoretical tests that gives a general conception of
the influence of the model parameters on its behavior. Then, we obtain some
restrictions on the principal parameters of the model, including the fractional
index, by means of the observational data. Finally, the cosmography parameters
and the observational data compared to the theoretical predictions are
presented both analytically and graphically.

advocated to improve timeliness and effectiveness of threat mitigation. Among

prompts important privacy, confidentiality, and liability issues. In this

different temporal sampling rate and accuracy (e.g., optical motion capture

check the approach of the system towards genuine local equilibrium, we compare
the local slope of the model transverse-momentum spectra with the local slope

thermalize with visible matter through the Higgs portal and identify the
remaining gaps in the viable parameter space. Such models require a comparably
light scalar mediator that mixes with the Higgs to avoid DM overproduction and
can be classified according to whether this mediator decays (in)visibly. In a
representative benchmark model with Dirac fermion DM, we find that, even with
conservative assumptions about the DM-mediator coupling and mass ratio, the
regime in which the mediator is heavier than the DM is fully ruled out by a
combination of collider, rare meson decay, and direct detection limits; future
and planned experiments including NA62 can further improve sensitivity to
scenarios in which the Higgs portal interaction does not determine the DM
abundance. The opposite, regime in which the mediator is lighter than the DM
and the latter annihilates to pairs of visibly-decaying mediators is still
viable, but much of the parameter space is covered by rare meson decay,
supernova cooling, beam dump, and direct detection constraints. Nearly all of
these conclusions apply broadly to the simplest variations (e.g. scalar or
asymmetric DM). Future experiments including SHiP, NEWS, and Super-CDMS SNOLAB
can greatly improve coverage to this class of models.

fragmentation properties of the northern OMC 1 filament. This filament is a
dense structure previously identified by JCMT/SCUBA submillimeter continuum and
VLA ammonia observations and shown to have fragmented into clumps. We observed
OMC1 n with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3mm and report on our analysis
of the continuum data. We discovered 24 new compact sources, ranging in mass
from 0.1 to 2.3, in size from 400 to 1300au, and in density from 2.6 x 10^7 to
2.8 x 10^6 cm^{-3}. The masses of these sources are similar to those of the SMA
protostars in OMC3, but their typical sizes and densities are lower by a factor
of ten. Only 8% of the new sources have infrared counterparts, yet there are
five associated CO molecular outflows. These sources are thus likely in the
Class 0 evolutionary phase yet it cannot be excluded that some of the sources
might still be pre-stellar cores. The spatial analysis of the protostars shows
that these are divided into small groups that coincide with previously
identified JCMT/SCUBA 850 micron and VLA ammonia clumps, and that these are
separated by a quasi-equidistant length of ~30arcmin (0.06pc). This separation
is dominated by the Jeans length, and therefore indicates that the main
physical process in the filament's evolution was thermal fragmentation. Within
the protostellar groups, the typical separation is ~6arcsec (~2500\,au), which
is a factor 2-3 smaller than the Jeans length of the parental clumps within
which the protostars are embedded. These results point to a hierarchical
(2-level) thermal fragmentation process of the OMC1n filament.

We offer a detailed derivation of the nuclear amplitudes based on the
interactions with quarks in the framework of a nonuniversal $U(1)'$ extension
of the standard model. By assuming a range of parameters compatible with
collider searches, electroweak observables and dark matter abundance, we find
scenarios for destructive interferences with and without isospin symmetry. The
model reveals solutions with mutually interfering scalar particles, canceling
the effective spin-independent coupling with only scalar interactions, which
requires an extra Higgs boson with mass $M_{H}>125$ GeV. The model also
possesses scenarios with only vector interactions through two neutral gauge
bosons, $Z$ and $Z'$. Due to the nonuniversality of the $U(1)'$ symmetry, we
distinguish two family structures of the quark sector with different numerical
predictions. In one case, we obtain cross sections that pass all the
Xenon-based detector experiments. In the other case, limits from LUX experiment
enclose an exclusion region for dark matter between $9$ and $800$ GeV. We
examine a third scenario with isospin-violating couplings where interferences
between scalar and vector boson exchanges cancel the scattering. We provide
solutions where interactions with Xenon-based detectors is suppressed for light
dark matter, below $6$ GeV, while interactions with Germanium- and
Silicon-based detectors exhibit solutions up to the regions of interest for
positive signals reported by CoGeNT and CDMS-Si experiments, and compatible
with the observed DM relic density for DM mass in the range $8.3-10$ GeV.
Spin-dependent interactions become the dominant source of scattering around the

Signatures for Genetic Regulatory Network (DSGRN) database. The motivation
stems from urgent need to understand the global dynamics of biologically
relevant signal transduction/gene regulatory networks that have at least 5 to
10 nodes, involve multiple interactions, and decades of parameters.
  The input to the database computations is a regulatory network, i.e.\ a
directed graph with edges indicating up or down regulation, from which a
computational model based on switching networks is generated. The phase space
dimension equals the number of nodes. The associated parameter space consists
of one parameter for each node (a decay rate), and three parameters for each
edge (low and high levels of expression, and a threshold at which expression
levels change). Since the nonlinearities of switching systems are piece-wise
constant, there is a natural decomposition of phase space into cells from which
the dynamics can be described combinatorially in terms of a state transition
graph. This in turn leads to compact representation of the global dynamics
called an annotated Morse graph that identifies recurrent and nonrecurrent. The
focus of this paper is on the construction of a natural computable finite
decomposition of parameter space into domains where the annotated Morse graph
description of dynamics is constant.
  We use this decomposition to construct an SQL database that can be
effectively searched for dynamic signatures such as bistability, stable or
unstable oscillations, and stable equilibria. We include two simple 3-node
networks to provide small explicit examples of the type information stored in
the DSGRN database. To demonstrate the computational capabilities of this
system we consider a simple network associated with p53 that involves 5-nodes
and a 29-dimensional parameter space.

distressingly absent from experiment. Neither wave tanks nor experiments in
open bodies detect this without nearly canceling ""eulerian flows."" Acoustic
waves have an analogous problem that is particularly problematic in the
vorticity production at the edges of beams. Here we demonstrate that the
explanation for this arises from subtle end-of-packet and wavetrain gradient
effects such as microbreaking events and wave-flow decomposition subtleties
required to conserve mass and momentum and avoid fictitious external forces.
These losses occur at both ends of packets and can produce a significant
nonviscous energy loss for translating and spreading surface wave packets and
wavetrains. In contrast, monochromatic sound wave packets will be shown to
asymmetrically distort to conserve momentum. This provides an interesting
analogy to how such internal forces arise for gradients of electromagnetic
wavetrains in media. Such examples show that the interactions of waves in media
are so system dependent as to be completely nonuniversal. These give further
examples of how boundary effects must be carefully considered for conservation
laws especially when harmonic functions are involved. The induced flows in
establishing surface waves are shown to be time changing and dependent on wave
history and suggest that some classical work based on mass flux and wave
interactions may need to be reconsidered.

constraints on the magnetic field configurations for coronal modeling and on
initial conditions for solar wind modeling. We work with polarized
SOHO/LASCO-C2 images from the last two recent minima of solar activity
(1996-1997 and 2008-2010), devoid of coronal mass ejections. The goals are to
derive the 4D electron density distributions in the corona by applying a newly
developed time-dependent tomographic reconstruction method and to compare the
results between the two solar minima and with two magnetohydrodynamic models.
First, we confirm that the values of the density distribution in thermodynamic
models are more realistic than in polytropic ones. The tomography provides more
accurate distributions in the polar regions, and we find that the density in
tomographic and thermodynamic solutions varies with the solar cycle in both
polar and equatorial regions. Second, we find that the highest-density
structures do not always correspond to the predicted large-scale heliospheric
current sheet or its helmet streamer but can follow the locations of
pseudo-streamers. We deduce that tomography offers reliable density
distributions in the corona, reproducing the slow time evolution of coronal
structures, without prior knowledge of the coronal magnetic field over a full
rotation. Finally, we suggest that the highest-density structures show a
differential rotation well above the surface depending on how they are
magnetically connected to the surface. Such valuable information on the
rotation of large-scale structures could help to connect the sources of the
solar wind to their in situ counterparts in future missions such as Solar

electrons in honeycomb materials via the introduction of random fields which
are coupled to the electrons and have a Gaussian distribution. From a one-body
approach to the problem, after integrating exactly the contribution of the
random fields, one builds a non-hermitian and dissipative effective Hamiltonian
with two-body interactions. Our approach introduces besides the usual average
over the electron field a second average over the random fields. The interplay
of two averages enables the definition of various types of Green's functions
which allow the investigation of fluctuation-dissipation characteristics of the
interactions that are a manifestation of the many-body problem. In the current
work we study only the dissipative term, through the perturbative analysis of
the dynamics associated the effective Hamiltonian generated by two different
kinds of couplings. For the cases analysed, the eigenstates of the effective
Hamiltonian are complex and, therefore, some of the states have a finite life
time. Moreover, we also investigate, in the mean field approximation, the most
general parity conserving coupling to the random fields and compute the width
of charge carriers $\Gamma$ as a function of the Fermi energy $E_F$. The
theoretical prediction for $\Gamma (E_F)$ is compared to the available
experimental data for graphene. The good agreement between $\Gamma_{theo}$ and
$\Gamma_{exp}$ suggests that description of the many-body problem associated to

traffic information system based on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). To
reflect the uncertainty of the information propagation, most of the existing
work was conducted by assuming the inter-vehicle distance follows some specific
probability models, e.g., the lognormal or exponential distribution, while
reducing the analysis complexity. Aimed at providing more generic results, a
recursive modeling framework is proposed for VANETs in this paper when the
vehicle spacing can be captured by a general i.i.d. distribution. With the
framework, the analytical expressions for a series of commonly discussed
metrics are derived respectively, including the mean, variance, probability
distribution of the propagation distance, and expectation for the number of
vehicles included in a propagation process, when the transmission failures are
mainly caused by MAC contentions. Moreover, a discussion is also made for
demonstrating the efficiency of the recursive analysis method when the impact
of channel fading is also considered. All the analytical results are verified
by extensive simulations. We believe that this work is able to potentially
reveal a more insightful understanding of information propagation in VANETs by
allowing to evaluate the effect of any vehicle headway distributions.

mounting two scanning tunneling microscopic tips on top of the topological
superconducting chain and measure the transmission spectrum between these two
metallic tips, there are two kinds of characteristics on the spectrum that are
caused by MBS uniquely. One is symmetric peaks with respect to zero energy and
the other is $4\pi$ period caused by a nearby Josephson junction. The former
refers to the fact that MBS are composited by Majorana fermions which
distributed in the particle and hole subspaces equally. The latter is based on
the well known $4\pi$ period of Josephson effect in topological superconductor.

from other candidates, such as impurities, Kondo effect and traditional Andreev
bound states.

tight in the sense that both are independent of eigenvalue; this is achieved by
working with an appropriate norm for boundary functions, which includes a
`spectral weight', that is, a function of the boundary Laplacian. This spectral
weight is chosen to cancel concentration at the boundary that can happen for
`whispering gallery' type eigenfunctions. These bounds are closely related to
wave equation estimates due to Tataru.

of a trial function $u$ solving the Helmholtz equation $(\Delta-E)u=0$. This

pronounced with small basis sets such as are used with DFT for proteins to
reduce the basis function count. This error disturbs calculation of a range of

  This finding has important implications for the selection of electronic

  Functions for Large-Scale Structured Convex Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The auxiliary problem principle of augmented Lagrangian (APP-AL), proposed by
Cohen and Zhu (1984), aims to find the solution of a constrained optimization
problem through a sequence of auxiliary problems involving augmented
Lagrangian. The merits of this approach are two folds. First, the core function
is usually separable, which makes the subproblems at each step decomposable and
particularly attractive for parallel computing. Second, the choice of the core
function is quite flexible. Consequently, by carefully specifying this
function, APP-AL may reduce to some standard optimization algorithms. In this
paper, we pursue enhancing such flexibility by allowing the core function to be
non-identical at each step of the algorithm, and name it varying auxiliary
problem principle (VAPP-AL). Depending on the problem structure, the varying
core functions in VAPP-AL can be adapted to design new flexible and suitable
algorithm for parallel and distributed computing. The convergence and O(1/t)
convergence rate of VAPP-AL for convex problem with coupling objective and
constraints is proved. Moreover, if this function is specialized to be
quadratic, an o(1/t) convergence rate can be established. Interestingly, the
new VAPP framework can cover several variants of Jacobian type augmented
Lagrangian decomposition methods as special cases. Furthermore, our technique
works for the convex problem with nonseparable objective and multi-blocks
coupled linear constraints, which usually can not be handled by ADMM.

deform to squeeze through these narrow vessels, transiently blocking or
occluding the vessels they pass through. Although the dynamics of vessel
occlusion have been studied extensively, it remains an open question why
microvessels need to be so narrow. We study occlusive dynamics within a model
microvascular network: the embryonic zebrafish trunk. We show that pressure
feedbacks created when red blood cells enter the finest vessels of the trunk
act together to uniformly partition red blood cells through the
microvasculature. Using mathematical models as well as direct observation, we
show that these occlusive feedbacks are tuned throughout the trunk network to
prevent the vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network.
Thus occlusion is linked with another open question of microvascular function:
how are red blood cells delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel? Our
analysis shows that tuning of occlusive feedbacks increase the total
dissipation within the network by a factor of 11, showing that uniformity of
flows rather than minimization of transport costs may be prioritized by the
microvascular network.

cosmological information on the matter distribution and probes galaxy evolution
by tracing the HI content of galaxies at different redshifts and the
scale-dependence of HI clustering. The cross-correlation of intensity maps with
galaxy surveys is a robust measure of the power spectrum which diminishes
systematics caused by instrumental effects and foreground removal. We examine
the cross-correlation signature at redshift z=0.9 using a variant of the
semi-analytical galaxy formation model SAGE (Croton et al. 2016) applied to the
Millennium simulation in order to model the HI gas of galaxies as well as their
optical magnitudes based on their star-formation history. We determine the
clustering of the cross-correlation power for different types of galaxies
determined by their colours, acting as a proxy for their star-formation
activity. We find that the cross-correlation coefficient for red quiescent
galaxies falls off more quickly on smaller scales k>0.2h/Mpc than for blue
star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we create a mock catalogue of highly
star-forming galaxies using a selection function to mimic the WiggleZ survey,
and use this to predict existing and future cross-correlation measurements of
the GBT and Parkes telescope. We find that the cross-power of highly
star-forming galaxies shows a higher clustering on small scales than any other
galaxy type and that this significantly alters the power spectrum shape on
scales k>0.2h/Mpc. We show that the cross-correlation coefficient is not
negligible when interpreting the cosmological cross-power spectrum. On the
other hand, it contains information about the HI content of the optically

analyzed at low temperatures. The phase-coherence length extracted from the

$(r,\ell)$-graph} if the vertex set $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $r$
independent sets and $\ell$ cliques. The class of $(r, \ell)$ graphs
generalizes $r$-colourable graphs (when $\ell =0)$ and hence not surprisingly,
determining whether a given graph is an $(r, \ell)$-graph is \NP-hard even when
$r \geq 3$ or $\ell \geq 3$ in general graphs.
  When $r$ and $\ell$ are part of the input, then the recognition problem is
NP-hard even if the input graph is a perfect graph (where the {\sc Chromatic
Number} problem is solvable in polynomial time). It is also known to be
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on perfect graphs when parameterized by $r$ and
$\ell$. I.e. there is an $f(r+\ell) \cdot n^{\Oh(1)}$ algorithm on perfect
graphs on $n$ vertices where $f$ is some (exponential) function of $r$ and
$\ell$.
  In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of the following
problem, which we call {\sc Vertex Partization}. Given a perfect graph $G$ and
positive integers $r,\ell,k$ decide whether there exists a set $S\subseteq
V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that the deletion of $S$ from $G$ results in an
$(r,\ell)$-graph. We obtain the following results: \begin{enumerate} \item {\sc
Vertex Partization} on perfect graphs is FPT when parameterized by $k+r+\ell$.
\item The problem does not admit any polynomial sized kernel when parameterized
by $k+r+\ell$. In other words, in polynomial time, the input graph can not be
compressed to an equivalent instance of size polynomial in $k+r+\ell$. In fact,
our result holds even when $k=0$.
  \item When $r,\ell$ are universal constants, then {\sc Vertex Partization} on
perfect graphs, parameterized by $k$, has a polynomial sized kernel.

problems. However, it converges slow, and can be difficult to tune. It is
possible to precondition SGD to accelerate its convergence remarkably. But many
attempts in this direction either aim at solving specialized problems, or
result in significantly more complicated methods than SGD. This paper proposes
a new method to estimate a preconditioner such that the amplitudes of
perturbations of preconditioned stochastic gradient match that of the
perturbations of parameters to be optimized in a way comparable to Newton
method for deterministic optimization. Unlike the preconditioners based on
secant equation fitting as done in deterministic quasi-Newton methods, which
assume positive definite Hessian and approximate its inverse, the new
preconditioner works equally well for both convex and non-convex optimizations
with exact or noisy gradients. When stochastic gradient is used, it can
naturally damp the gradient noise to stabilize SGD. Efficient preconditioner
estimation methods are developed, and with reasonable simplifications, they are
applicable to large scaled problems. Experimental results demonstrate that
equipped with the new preconditioner, without any tuning effort, preconditioned
SGD can efficiently solve many challenging problems like the training of a deep
neural network or a recurrent neural network requiring extremely long term
memories.

obtain the decomposition on a (small) compressed matrix representation of the

superconducting order parameter will vanish while the energy gap will persist,
which indicates that the system undergoes a transition from a superconducting
state to an insulating state. This can be confirmed by calculating the inverse
participation ratio. We also find that, if the strength of disorder is small,
the superconducting order parameter and the energy gap will decrease if we
increase the strength of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. In the large
disorder limits, increasing the strength of spin-orbit coupling will increase
the mean superconducting order parameter. This phenomenon shows that the system

to drop from being exponential in the number $n$ of processes to being linear
under the assumption that each process knows $n$. In particular, the amortized
midpoint algorithm, which achieves a linear decision time, works in completely
anonymous dynamic rooted networks where processes can exchange and store
continuous values, and under the assumption that the number of processes is
known to all processes. We then study the way amortized averaging algorithms
degrade when communication graphs are from time to time non rooted, or with a
wrong estimate of the number of processes. Finally, we analyze the amortized

quantitative arguments pertaining to the dynamically reached ones. This

electric-dipole moments to an external time-dependent electric field, are
discussed in a few particular conditions which can be of some experimental
interest. First, the spherical-pendulum molecular model is reviewed, with the
aim of introducing an approximate method which consists in the separation of
the azimuthal and zenithal motions. Second, rotation spectra are considered in
the presence of a static electric field. Two particular cases are analyzed,
corresponding to strong and weak fields. In both cases the dipoles perform
rotations and vibrations about equilibrium positions, which may exhibit
parametric resonances. For strong fields a large macroscopic electric
polarization may appear. This situation may be relevant for polar matter (like
pyroelectrics, ferroelectrics), or for heavy impurities embedded in a polar
solid. The dipolar interaction is analyzed in polar condensed matter, where it
is shown that new polarization modes appear for a spontaneous macroscopic
electric polarization (these modes are tentatively called ""dipolons""); one of
the polarization modes is related to parametric resonances. The extension of
these considerations to magnetic dipoles is briefly discussed. The treatment is

also used for describing the residuals after subtraction of the apsidal motion,

case of a dust fluid. Here, we extend the previous analysis to the more general
case of a fluid with non-negligible pressure, and, for the numerical examples,
we consider the case of radiation (P=\rho/3). We find that, even when the
density contrast has a nonlinear amplitude, the Newtonian description of the
cosmological perturbations using the gravitational potential \psi and the
curvature potential \phi is valid as long as we consider sub-horizon
inhomogeneities. However, the relation \psi+\phi={\cal O}(\phi^2), which holds
for the case of a dust fluid, is not valid for a relativistic fluid and
effective anisotropic stress is generated. This demonstrates the usefulness of
the Lemaitre model which allows us to study in an exact nonlinear fashion the
onset of anisotropic stress in fluids with non-negligible pressure. We show
that this happens when the characteristic scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller
than the sound horizon and that the deviation is caused by the nonlinear effect
of the fluid's fast motion. We also find that \psi+\phi= \max[{\cal
O}(\phi^2),{\cal O}(c_s^2\phi \, \delta)] for an inhomogeneity with density
contrast \delta whose characteristic scale is smaller than the sound horizon,
unless w is close to -1, where w and c_s are the equation of state parameter
and the sound speed of the fluid, respectively. On the other hand, we expect
\psi+\phi={\cal O}(\phi^2) to hold for an inhomogeneity whose characteristic
scale is larger than the sound horizon, unless the amplitude of the

reflection of internal cognitive processes is a hallmark of human brain
function. However, its identification in fMRI data of the human brain is
notoriously difficult. Here we propose a new method of fMRI data analysis that
tackles this problem by considering large-scale, task-related synchronisation
networks. Networks consist of nodes and edges connecting them, where nodes
correspond to voxels in fMRI data, and the weight of an edge is determined via
task-related changes in dynamic synchronisation between their respective times
series. Based on these definitions, we developed a new data analysis algorithm
that identifies edges in a brain network that differentially respond in unison
to a task onset and that occur in dense packs with similar characteristics.
Hence, we call this approach ""Task-related Edge Density"" (TED). TED proved to
be a very strong marker for dynamic network formation that easily lends itself
to statistical analysis using large scale statistical inference. A major
advantage of TED compared to other methods is that it does not depend on any
specific hemodynamic response model, and it also does not require a
presegmentation of the data for dimensionality reduction as it can handle large
networks consisting of tens of thousands of voxels. We applied TED to fMRI data
of a fingertapping task provided by the Human Connectome Project. TED revealed
network-based involvement of a large number of brain areas that evaded
detection using traditional GLM-based analysis. We show that our proposed
method provides an entirely new window into the immense complexity of human
brain function.

high-precision data reveals previously unseen details but is limited in parts
by systematic effects. The PWA is based on the isobar model, in which
multi-particle decays are described as a chain of subsequent two-body decays.
Here, fixed mass distributions for the appearing intermediate resonances, the
so-called isobars, are assumed. These shapes, which e.g. may be parametrized by
Breit-Wigner amplitudes, represent prior knowledge that has to be put into the
analysis model and may therefore introduce a model dependence, thus increasing
systematic uncertainties. We present a novel method, which allows to extract
isobar amplitudes directly from the data in a more model-independent way. As a

wireless receiver enabling coherent transmission of complex-valued
constellations, only affected by noise and interference. Whenever these
disturbances are sufficiently small and long data frames are used, high data
rates can be achieved and the resource overhead due to the pilots vanishes
asymptotically. On the other, it is expected that for the next generation of
mobile networks not only data rate is in the main focus but also low latency,
short and sporadic messages, massive connectivity, distributed & adhoc
processing and robustness with respect to asynchronism. Therefore a review of
several well-established principles in communication has been started already.
A particular implication when using complex-valued pilots is that these values
have to be known at the receiver and therefore these resources can not be used
simultaneously for user data. For an OFDM-like multicarrier scheme this means
that pilot tones (usually placed equidistantly according to the Nyquist
theorem) are allocated with globally known amplitudes and phases to reconstruct
the channel impulse response. Phases are designed and allocated globally which
is in contrast to a distributed infrastructure. In this work we present
therefore a new phaseless pilot scheme where only pilot amplitudes need to be
known at the receiver, i.e., phases are available again and can be used for
various other purposes. The idea is based on a phase retrieval result for
symmetrized and zero-padded magnitude Fourier measurements obtained by two of
the authors. The phases on the pilot tones can now be used to carry additional
user-specific data or compensate for other signal characteristics, like the
PAPR.

populations and the light-element anticorrelations in globular clusters. If the
star formation efficiency was around 30 per cent and the gas expulsion happened
on the crossing timescale, this process could expel preferentially stars born
with the chemical composition of the proto-cluster gas, while stars with
special composition born in the centre would remain bound. Recently, a sample
of extragalactic, gas-free, young massive clusters has been identified that has
the potential to test the conditions for gas expulsion. We compute a large
number of thin shell models, and calculate if the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
is able to disrupt the shell before it reaches the escape speed. We show that
the success of gas expulsion depends on the compactness index of a star cluster
C5, proportionate to stellar mass over half-mass radius. For given C5, a
certain critical, local star formation efficiency is required to remove the
rest of the gas. Common stellar feedback processes may not lead to gas
expulsion with significant loss of stars above C5 = 1. Considering pulsar winds
and hypernovae, the limit increases to C5 = 30. If successful, gas expulsion
generally takes place on the crossing timescale. Some observed young massive
clusters have 1 < C5 < 10 and are gas-free at 10 Myr. This suggests that gas
expulsion does not affect their stellar mass significantly, unless powerful
pulsar winds and hypernovae are common in such objects. By comparison to
observations, we show that C5 is a better predictor for the expression of
multiple populations than stellar mass. The best separation between star
clusters with and without multiple populations is achieved by a stellar
winds-based gas expulsion model, where gas expulsion would occur exclusively in
star clusters without multiple populations.

magnetic field build up and decay in relativistic shocks are open questions
with important implications to various phenomena in high energy astrophysics.
While the Weibel instability is possibly responsible for magnetic field build
up and diffusive shock acceleration is a model for acceleration, both have
problems and current PIC simulation show that particles are accelerated only
under special conditions and the magnetic field decays on a short length scale.
We present here a novel model for the structure and the emission of highly
relativistic collisionless shocks. The model takes into account (and is based
on) non-local energy and momentum transport across the shock front via emission
and absorption of high-energy photons. This leads to a pre-acceleration of the
fluid and pre-amplificaiton of the magnetic fields in the upstream region. Both
have drastic implications on the shock structure. The model explains the
persistence of the shock generated magnetic field at large distances from the
shock front. The dissipation of this magnetic field results in a continuous
particle acceleration within the downstream region. The model suggests two
non-uniform emission zones (the downstream and the upstream), that give rise to
three emission components with different spectral and temporal properties. A
unique feature of the model is the existence of an ""attractor"", toward which
any shock will evolve. This enables us to estimate from first principles the
synchrotron and inverse Compton spectrum of the downstream emission. The model
is applicable to any relativistic shock, but its distinctive features show up
only for large compactness. We demonstrate that prompt and afterglow Gamma-Ray
Bursts' shocks satisfy the relevant conditions and compare their observations
with the predictions.

thin pores and uses a one-dimensional flux-force formalism which relates fluxes

in electric potential, salt concentration, pressure). We analyze the general
case with overlapping electric double layers in the pore and a nonzero axial
salt concentration gradient. The 3$\times$3 matrix relating these quantities
exhibits Onsager symmetry and we report a significant new simplification for
the diagonal element relating axial salt flux to the gradient in chemical
potential. We prove that Onsager symmetry is preserved under changes of

matrix given by Gross and Osterle (1968). The capillary pore model is
well-suited to describe the nonlinear response of charged membranes or
nanofluidic devices for electrokinetic energy conversion and water
desalination, as long as the transverse ion profiles remain in local
quasi-equilibrium. As an example, we evaluate electrical power production from
a salt concentration difference by reverse electrodialysis, using an efficiency
vs. power diagram. We show that since the capillary pore model allows for axial
gradients in salt concentration, partial loops in current, salt flux or fluid
flow can develop in the pore. Predictions for macroscopic transport properties
using a reduced model where the potential and concentration are assumed to be
invariant with radial coordinate (""uniform potential"" or ""fine capillary pore""

satellite and covers a total area of 50 square degrees distributed over two
fields. It primarily aims at investigating the large-scale structures of the
Universe using the distribution of galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei
as tracers of the matter distribution.
  Aims. This article presents the XXL bright cluster sample, a subsample of 100
galaxy clusters selected from the full XXL catalogue by setting a lower limit
of $3\times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{erg \,s^{-1}cm^{-2}}$ on the source flux within a
1$^{\prime}$ aperture.
  Methods. The selection function was estimated using a mixture of Monte Carlo
simulations and analytical recipes that closely reproduce the source selection
process. An extensive spectroscopic follow-up provided redshifts for 97 of the
100 clusters. We derived accurate X-ray parameters for all the sources. Scaling
relations were self-consistently derived from the same sample in other
publications of the series. On this basis, we study the number density,
luminosity function, and spatial distribution of the sample.
  Results. The bright cluster sample consists of systems with masses between
$M_{500}=7\times 10^{13}$ and $3\times 10^{14} M_\odot$, mostly located between
$z=0.1$ and 0.5. The observed sky density of clusters is slightly below the
predictions from the WMAP9 model, and significantly below the predictions from
the Planck 2015 cosmology. In general, within the current uncertainties of the
cluster mass calibration, models with higher values of $\sigma_8$ and/or
$\Omega_m$ appear more difficult to accommodate. We provide tight constraints
on the cluster differential luminosity function and find no hint of evolution
out to $z\sim1$. We also find strong evidence for the presence of large-scale
structures in the XXL bright cluster sample and identify five new
superclusters.

implications in biology, condensed matter physics and electrical engineering

topologies and show that different phase-locked solutions are related to one
another by loop currents. The latter take only discrete values, as they are
characterized by topological winding numbers. This result is generically valid
for any network, and also applies beyond the Kuramoto model, as long as the
coupling between oscillators is antisymmetric in the oscillators' coordinates.
Motivated by these results we further investigate loop currents in
Kuramoto-like models. We consider loop currents in nonoriented $n$-node cycle
networks with nearest-neighbor coupling. Amplifying on earlier works, we give
an algebraic upper bound $\mathcal{N} \le 2 \, {\rm Int}[n/4]+1$ for the number
$\cal N$ of different, linearly stable phase-locked solutions. We show that the
number of different stable solutions monotonically decreases as the coupling
strength is decreased. Furthermore stable solutions with a single angle
difference exceeding $\pi/2$ emerge as the coupling constant $K$ is reduced, as
smooth continuations of solutions with all angle differences smaller than
$\pi/2$ at higher $K$. In a cycle network with nearest-neighbor coupling we
further show that phase-locked solutions with two or more angle differences
larger than $\pi/2$ are all linearly unstable. We point out similarities

Observatory, a NASA satellite, collect massive streams of high resolution
images of the Sun through multiple wavelength filters. Reconstructing
pixel-by-pixel thermal properties based on these images can be framed as an
ill-posed inverse problem with Poisson noise, but this reconstruction is
computationally expensive and there is disagreement among researchers about
what regularization or prior assumptions are most appropriate. This article
presents an image segmentation framework for preprocessing such images in order
to reduce the data volume while preserving as much thermal information as
possible for later downstream analyses. The resulting segmented images reflect
thermal properties but do not depend on solving the ill-posed inverse problem.
This allows users to avoid the Poisson inverse problem altogether or to tackle
it on each of $\sim$10 segments rather than on each of $\sim$10$^7$ pixels,
reducing computing time by a factor of $\sim$10$^6$. We employ a parametric
class of dissimilarities that can be expressed as cosine dissimilarity
functions or Hellinger distances between nonlinearly transformed vectors of
multi-passband observations in each pixel. We develop a decision theoretic
framework for choosing the dissimilarity that minimizes the expected loss that
arises when estimating identifiable thermal properties based on segmented
images rather than on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We also examine the efficacy of
different dissimilarities for recovering clusters in the underlying thermal
properties. The expected losses are computed under scientifically motivated
prior distributions. Two simulation studies guide our choices of dissimilarity
function. We illustrate our method by segmenting images of a coronal hole

the proposal for the electronic ferroelectricity in conjugated polymers from
the family of substituted polyacetylenes. The attractive feature of synthetic
organic ferroelectrics is a very high polarizability coming from redistribution
of the electronic density, rather than from conventional displacements of ions.
Next fortunate peculiarity is the symmetry determined predictable design of
perspective materials. The macroscopic electric polarization follows ultimately
from combination of two types of a microscopic symmetry breaking which are
ubiquitous to qusi-1D electronic systems. The state supports anomalous
quasi-particles - microscopic solitons, carrying non-integer electric charges,
which here play the role of nano-scale nucleus of ferroelectric domain walls.
Their spectroscopic features in optics can interfere with low-frequency
ferroelectric repolarization providing new accesses and applications. In
addition to already existing electronic ferroelectricity in organic crystals
and donor-acceptor chains, we point to a class of conducting polymers and may
be also to nano-ribbons of the graphene where such a state can be found. These
proposals may lead to potential applications in modern intensive searches of

publication in Advances in Chemical Engineering, 47: 193-277 (2015). Gas-solid
fluidization is a typical nonlinear nonequilibrium system with multiscale
structure. In particular, the mesoscale structure in terms of bubbles or
clusters, which can be characterized by nonequilibrium features in terms of
bimodal velocity distribution, energy non equipartition, and correlated density
fluctuations, is the critical factor. Traditional two-fluid model (TFM) and
relevant closures depend on local equilibrium and homogeneous distribution
assumptions, and fail to predict the dynamic, nonequilibrium phenomena in
circulating fluidized beds even with fine-grid resolution. In contrast, the
mesoscale modeling, as exemplified by the energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS)
model, is consistent with the nonequilibrium features in multiphase flows.
Thus, the structure-dependent multi-fluid model conservation equations with the
EMMS-based mesoscale modeling greatly improve the prediction accuracy in terms
of flow, mass transfer, and reactions as well as the understanding of flow
regime transitions. Such discrepancies raise the question of the applicability
of the local equilibrium assumption underlying the TFM and further shed light
to the necessity of mesoscale modeling.

complex oxides, lanthanum aluminate (LAO) and strontium titanate (STO) has
several intriguing properties that set it apart from conventional
superconductors. Most notably, an electric field can be used to tune its
critical temperature (T$_c$), revealing a dome-shaped phase diagram reminiscent
of high T$_c$ superconductors. So far, experiments with oxide interfaces have
measured quantities which probe only the magnitude of the superconducting order
parameter and are not sensitive to its phase. Here, we perform phase-sensitive
measurements by realizing the first superconducting quantum interference
devices (SQUIDs) at the LAO/STO interface. Furthermore, we develop a new
paradigm for the creation of superconducting circuit elements, where local
gates enable in-situ creation and control of Josephson junctions. These
gate-defined SQUIDs are unique in that the entire device is made from a single
superconductor with purely electrostatic interfaces between the superconducting
reservoir and the weak link. We complement our experiments with numerical
simulations and show that the low superfluid density of this interfacial
superconductor results in a large, gate-controllable kinetic inductance of the
SQUID. Our observation of robust quantum interference opens up a new pathway to
understand the nature of superconductivity at oxide interfaces.

ratio is higher than that of HDO/H2O by about one order of magnitude in the
vicinity of low-mass protostar NGC 1333-IRAS 2A, where water ice has
sublimated. Previous laboratory and theoretical studies show that the D2O/HDO
ice ratio should be lower than the HDO/H2O ice ratio, if HDO and D2O ices are
formed simultaneously with H2O ice. In this work, we propose that the observed
feature, D2O/HDO > HDO/H2O, is a natural consequence of chemical evolution in
the early cold stages of low-mass star formation: 1) majority of oxygen is
locked up in water ice and other molecules in molecular clouds, where water
deuteration is not efficient, and 2) water ice formation continues with much
reduced efficiency in cold prestellar/protostellar cores, where deuteration
processes are highly enhanced due to the drop of the ortho-para ratio of H2,
the weaker UV radiation field, etc. Using a simple analytical model and gas-ice
astrochemical simulations tracing the evolution from the formation of molecular
clouds to protostellar cores, we show that the proposed scenario can
quantitatively explain the observed HDO/H2O and D2O/HDO ratios. We also find
that the majority of HDO and D2O ices are likely formed in cold
prestellar/protostellar cores rather than in molecular clouds, where the
majority of H2O ice is formed. This work demonstrates the power of the
combination of the HDO/H2O and D2O/HDO ratios as a tool to reveal the past
history of water ice formation in the early cold stages of star formation and
when the enrichment of deuterium in the bulk of water occurred. Further
observations are needed to explore if the relation, D2O/HDO > HDO/H2O, is
common in low-mass protostellar sources.

from synaptic input to neurons and the ensuing subthreshold dendritic
processing. The role of active dendritic conductances in shaping the LFP has
received little attention, even though such ion channels are known to affect
the subthreshold neuron dynamics. Here we used a modeling approach to
investigate the effects of subthreshold dendritic conductances on the LFP.
Using a biophysically detailed, experimentally constrained model of a cortical
pyramidal neuron, we identified conditions under which subthreshold active
conductances are a major factor in shaping the LFP. We found that particularly
the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I$_{\rm h}$, can have a sizable
effect and cause a resonance in the LFP power spectral density. To get a
general, qualitative understanding of how any subthreshold active dendritic
conductance and its cellular distribution can affect the LFP, we next performed
a systematic study with a simplified model. We found that the effect on the LFP
is most pronounced when (1) the synaptic drive to the cell is asymmetrically
distributed (i.e., either basal or apical), (2) the active conductances are
distributed non-uniformly with the highest channel densities near the synaptic
input, and (3) when the LFP is measured at the opposite pole of the cell
relative to the synaptic input. In summary, we show that subthreshold active
conductances can be strongly reflected in LFP signals, opening up the
possibility that the LFP can be used to characterize the properties and
cellular distributions of active conductances.

(SNR) Kes 79 (G33.6+0.1). The X-ray spectrum is best fitted by a
two-temperature model: a non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) plasma and a
collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma. The NEI plasma is spatially
confined within the inner radio shell with kT~0.8 keV, while the CIE plasma is
found in more spatially extended regions associated with the outer radio shell
with kT~0.2 keV and solar abundance. Therefore, the NEI plasma is attributable
to the SN ejecta and the CIE plasma is forward shocked interstellar medium. In
the NEI plasma, we discovered K-shell line of Al, Ar and Ca for the first time.
The abundance pattern and estimated mass of the ejecta are consistent with the
core-collapse supernova explosion of a ~30-40 solar mass progenitor star. An Fe
line with center energy of ~6.4 keV is also found in the southeast (SE) portion
of the SNR, a close peripheral region around dense molecular clouds. One
possibility is that the line is associated with the ejecta. However, the
centroid energy of ~6.4 keV and the spatial distribution of enhancement near
the SE peripheral do not favor this scenario. Since the ~6.4 keV emitting
region coincides to the molecular clouds, we propose another possibility that
the Fe line is due to K-shell ionization of neutral Fe by the interaction of
locally accelerated protons (LECRp) with the surrounding molecular cloud. Both
these possibilities, heated ejecta or LECRp origin, are discussed based on the
observational facts.

high data rates. A key challenge in such D2D-enabled HCNs is how to design an
effective association scheme with D2D model selection for load balancing.
Moreover, the offloaded users and D2D receivers (RXs) would suffer strong
interference from BSs, especially from high-power BSs. Evidently, a good
association scheme should integrate with interference mitigation. Thus, we
first propose an effective resource partitioning strategy that can mitigate the
interference received by offloaded users from high-power BSs and the one
received by D2D RXs from BSs. Based on this, we then design a user association
scheme for load balancing, which jointly considers user association and D2D
model selection to maximize network-wide utility. Considering that the
formulated problem is in a nonlinear and mixted-integer form and hard to
tackle, we adopt a dual decomposition method to develop an efficient
distributed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme
provides a load balancing gain and a resource partitioning gain.

a comprehensive analysis of the statistical properties of the probability
fluxes. To this aim we define a simple model of the Markovian stochastic
dynamics on a complex network extended by the additional transition, called
hereafter the gate. The random skips through the gate, driven by the external
constant force, violate the detailed balance in the network. We argue, using a
theoretical approach and numerical simulations, that the stationary
distributions of the probability fluxes emergent under such conditions
converge, regardless of the network topology, to the normal distribution. This
result, combined with the stationary fluctuation theorem, permits to show that
its standard deviation depends directly on the square root of the average flux.
In turn, the central result of our paper relates this quantity to the external
constant force and the two parameters that entirely characterize the normal
distribution of the probability fluxes both close to as well as far from the
equilibrium state. Also, the other effects that modify these parameters, such
as the addition of shortcuts to the tree-like network, the extension and
configuration of the gate and a change in the network size studied by means of
the computer simulations are widely discussed in terms of the rigorous
theoretical predictions.

fabricated with modified HTL and two photoactive polymer blends led
systematically to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) increases, with

pristine HTL devices. A reduced device-to-device characteristics variations was
also noticed when fluorinated additives were used to modify the PEDOT:PSS.
Shading lights onto the effect of HTL fluorination, we show that the morphology
of the polymer:PCBM blends remains surprisingly unaffected by the fluorinated
HTL surface energy but that, instead, the OPVs are impacted not only by the HTL
electronic properties (work function, dipole layer, open circuit voltage,
charge transfer dynamic) but also by alteration of the complex refractive
indices (photogeneration, short circuit current density, external quantum
efficiencies, electro-optic modelling). Both mechanisms find their origin in
fluorination induced charge transfers. This work points towards fluorination as
a promising strategy toward combining both external quantum efficiency
modulation and power conversion efficiency enhancement in OPVs. Charge
transfers could also be used more broadly to tune the optical constants and
electric field distribution, as well as to reduce interfacial charge
recombinations within OPVs.

to serve as a pathfinder for future, wide-area X-ray missions. We review
science objectives, including cluster studies, AGN evolution, and large-scale

follow-up programmes. We describe the 542 XMM observations along with the
associated multi-lambda and numerical simulation programmes. We give a detailed

developed for the cosmological analysis. The paper provides a thorough

studies and will serve as a calibration resource for future dark energy studies
with clusters and other X-ray selected sources. With the present article, we
release the XMM XXL photon and smoothed images along with the corresponding

which the mobility and diffusivity of free particles are not simply
proportional to each other. We derive both the response to a mechanical forcing
and to temperature variations in terms of correlations between an observable
and a path-weight action. The time-antisymmetric component of the latter turns
out not to be simply proportional to the heat flowing into the environment.
These results are visualized with simulations resembling conditions and
protocols easily realizable in the experiment, thereby tracing a path for
experimental verifications of the theory.

for 54 cyclones between 1977 and 2010. Storm surge magnitude is inferred from
residual water levels computed by subtracting modeled astronomical tides from
observed water levels at each station. Observed residual water levels are
generally smaller than reported storm surge levels for cyclones where both are
available, and many cyclones produce no obvious residual at all. Both maximum
and minimum residual water levels are higher for west-landing cyclones
producing onshore winds and generally diminish for cyclones making landfall on
the Bangladesh coast or eastward producing offshore winds. Water levels
observed during cyclones are generally more strongly influenced by tidal phase
and amplitude than by storm surge alone. In only 7 of the 15 stations does the
highest plausible observed water level coincide with a cyclone. While
cyclone-coincident residual water level maxima occur at a wide range of tidal
phases, very few coincide with high spring tides. Comparisons of
cyclone-related casualties with maximum wind speed, hour of landfall,
population density and residual water level (inferred storm surge) show no
significant correlations for any single characteristic. Cyclones with high
casualties are often extreme in one or more of these characteristics but there
appears to be no single extreme characteristic shared by all high casualty
cyclones.

problem has been attacked in various ways in the literature. Here, in the
present work, we show that a statistical approach to the problem, motivated by
the imaginary nature of time in the forbidden regions, lead to a novel
tunneling time formula which is real and subluminal (in contrast to various
known time definitions implying superluminal tunneling). This entropic
tunneling time, as we call it, shows good agreement with the tunneling time
measurements in laser-driven He ionization. Moreover, it sets an accurate range
for long-range electron transfer reactions. The entropic tunneling time is
general enough to extend to the photon and phonon tunneling phenomena.

analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of
exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1
to 1.7 {\mu}m). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much
weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted.
The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water
abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary
disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level
of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the
result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra.
Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering
the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the
optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our
results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from
clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary
radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for
distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the
spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in
clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds
and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during
formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker
spectral signatures.

multifibre spectroscopic observations of three 0.55 sq.deg. fields in the XXL
Survey, which were selected on the basis of their high density of
X-ray-detected clusters. The observations were obtained with the
AutoFib2+WYFFOS (AF2) wide-field fibre spectrograph mounted on the 4.2m William
Herschel Telescope. The paper first describes the scientific rationale, the
preparation, the data reduction, and the results of the observations, and then
presents a study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) within three superclusters. We
obtained redshifts for 455 galaxies in total, 56 of which are counterparts of
X-ray point-like sources. We were able to determine the redshift of the merging
supercluster XLSSC-e, which consists of six individual clusters at z~0.43, and
we confirmed the redshift of supercluster XLSSC-d at z~0.3. More importantly,
we discovered a new supercluster, XLSSC-f, that comprises three galaxy clusters
also at z~0.3. We find a significant 2D overdensity of X-ray point-like sources
only around the supercluster XLSSC-f. This result is also supported by the
spatial (3D) analysis of XLSSC-f, where we find four AGN with compatible
spectroscopic redshifts and possibly one more with compatible photometric
redshift. In addition, we find two AGN (3D analysis) at the redshift of
XLSSC-e, but no AGN in XLSSC-d. Comparing these findings with the optical
galaxy overdensity we conclude that the total number of AGN in the area of the
three superclusters significantly exceeds the field expectations. The
difference in the AGN frequency between the three superclusters cannot be
explained by the present study because of small number statistics. Further
analysis of a larger number of superclusters within the 50 sq. deg. of the XXL

on AGN can be reached.

with XMM-Newton. Covering an area of 50 square degrees distributed over two
fields, it primarily investigates the large-scale structures of the Universe
using the distribution of galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei as tracers
of the matter distribution. Given its depth and sky coverage, XXL is
particularly suited to systematically unveiling the clustering of X-ray
clusters and to identifying superstructures in a homogeneous X-ray sample down
to the typical mass scale of a local massive cluster. A friends-of-friends
algorithm in three-dimensional physical space was run to identify large-scale
structures. In this paper we report the discovery of the highest redshift
supercluster of galaxies found in the XXL Survey. We describe the X-ray
properties of the clusters members of the structure and the optical follow-up.
The newly discovered supercluster is composed of six clusters of galaxies at a
median redshift z around 0.43 and distributed across approximately 30 by 15 arc
minutes (10 by 5 Mpc on sky) on the sky. This structure is very compact with
all the clusters residing in one XMM pointing; for this reason this is the
first supercluster discovered with the XXL Survey. Spectroscopic follow-up with
WHT (William Herschel Telescope) and NTT (New Technology Telescope) confirmed a
median redshift of z = 0.43. An estimate of the X-ray mass and luminosity of
this supercluster and of its total gas mass put XLSSC-e at the average mass
range of superclusters; its appearance, with two members of equal size, is
quite unusual with respect to other superclusters and provides a unique view of
the formation process of a massive structure.

close to the light velocity it is determined also by the heating power for the

of high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods to buoyancy-driven cargo hold fire
simulations, second, to explore statistical variation in the fluid dynamics of
a cargo hold fire given parameterized uncertainty in the fire source location
and temperature. Cargo hold fires represent a class of problems that require
highly-accurate computational methods to simulate faithfully. Hence, we use an
in-house discontinuous Galerkin code to treat these flows. Cargo hold fires
also exhibit a large amount of uncertainty with respect to the boundary
conditions. Thus, the second aim of this paper is to quantify the resulting
uncertainty in the flow, using tools from the uncertainty quantification
community to ensure that our efforts require a minimal number of simulations.
We expect that the results of this study will provide statistical insight into
the effects of fire location and temperature on cargo fires, and also assist in
the optimization of fire detection system placement.

quantization of gravity. In a physically meaningful (anomaly free) theory, the
constraint operators must be first class, and their commutator algebra is
expected to resemble the corresponding classical Poisson-bracket algebra. In
this paper, we review the ""constructive"" approach to obtaining a consistent set
of constraints: start with a Hamiltonian constraint and generate the
corresponding diffeomorphism constraint as a commutator of two Hamiltonians.
Closure of the constraint operator algebra then requires that the
diffeomorphism operator obtained in this way weakly commutes with another
Hamiltonian constraint operator. The same procedure can be used to check the
consistency of some proposed quantization schemes that present a candidate
Hamiltonian constraint, which we do for a spherically symmetric model.

under the Coulomb repulsion, the electrons inside the stars could spontaneously
magnetized and become ferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net
magnetic momentum to the whole star. The leading order approximation in our
simple model shows that the magnetism of solid quark-cluster matter could be
possible. For most cases in solid quark-cluster stars, the amount of net
magnetic momentum, could be significant, and the net magnetic moments of
electron system in solid quark-cluster stars could be large enough to induce
the observed magnetic fields for pulsars with $B\sim 10^{11}$ to $\sim 10^{13}$
Gauss. This mechanism of generating magnetic field is not valid for so-called
magnetars.

studied. Four-contact structure on the base of high-quality o-TaS$_3$ crystal,
containing a segment with a strain (1 \%) and one without it, separated by a
buffer part, has been prepared for the study. Notable changes both $G(T)$ and
$\delta G(T)$ have been observed below $T < 60$~K under uniaxial strain,
namely: a plateau of $G(T)$ in the region of activation-law-change becomes
wider under the strain, and an additional low-temperature maximum of $\delta
G(T)$ appears, its value being even bigger than one of the main maximum of
$\delta G(T)$, which is mainly due to single particle excitations. As a result
the values of $G(T)$ and $\delta G(T)$ become one order bigger than the ones
without strain. The relative changes of $G(T)$ and $\delta G(T)$ under the
strain exhibit a sharp step-like growth upon cooling at slightly different
temperatures ($\approx 10$~K). The observed features are consistent with a
simple model implying strain-induced increase of concentration of solitons
which contribute into both conduction and photoconduction.

dynamic process driven by nonlinear interactions in the sociocultural school
environment. The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired
by a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th
grades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.
Qualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible
ramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the
community level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the
population-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings
that agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food
association learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient
communities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \textit{Ratatouille} effect
can be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,
a potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the
overall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the
effectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of
institutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,
cultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values
in the community.

understanding to achieve optimized flow and heat transfer characteristics. A
thorough computational study has been performed to understand the concentration
and thermohydraulic maldistribution of nanofluids in parallel microchannel
systems using an Eulerian Lagrangian twin phase model. The study reveals that
nanofluids cannot be treated as homogeneous single phase fluids in such complex
flow domains and effective property models fail drastically to predict the
performance parameters. To comprehend the distribution of the particulate
phase, a novel concentration maldistribution factor has been proposed. It has
been observed that distribution of particles need not essentially follow the
flow pattern, leading to higher thermal performance than expected from
homogeneous models. Particle maldistribution has been conclusively shown to be
due to various migration and diffusive phenomena like Stokesian drag, Brownian
motion, thermophoretic drift, etc. The implications of particle distribution on
the cooling performance have been illustrated and smart fluid effects (reduced
magnitude of maximum temperature) have been observed and a mathematical model
to predict the enhanced cooling performance in such flow geometries has been
proposed. The article presents lucidly the effectiveness of discrete phase
approach in modelling nanofluid thermohydraulics and sheds insight on behavior
of nanofluids in complex flow domains.

limited success in understanding MYCN functionality in the landscape of
neuroblastoma and more importantly, given that MYCN has been deemed
undruggable, the need to potentially illuminate key opportunities that
indirectly target MYCN is of great interest. To this end, this work employs an
emerging quantitative technique from network science, namely network curvature,
to quantify the biological robustness of MYCN and its surrounding neighborhood.
In particular, when amplified in Stage IV cancer, MYCN exhibits higher
curvature (more robust) than those samples with under expressed MYCN levels.
When examining the surrounding neighborhood, the above argument still holds for
network curvature, but is lost when only analyzing differential expression - a
common technique amongst oncologists and computational/molecular biologists.
This finding points to the problem (and possible solution) of drug targeting in
the context of complexity and indirect cell signaling affects that have often
been obfuscated through traditional techniques.

BarcelonaTech. 169 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Understanding humans from photographs has always been a fundamental goal of
computer vision. In this thesis we have developed a hierarchy of tools that
cover a wide range of topics with the objective of understanding humans from
monocular RGB image: from low level feature point descriptors to high level
fashion-aware conditional random fields models. In order to build these high
level models it is paramount to have a battery of robust and reliable low and
mid level cues. Along these lines, we have proposed two low-level keypoint
descriptors: one based on the theory of the heat diffusion on images, and the
other that uses a convolutional neural network to learn discriminative image
patch representations. We also introduce distinct low-level generative models
for representing human pose: in particular we present a discrete model based on
a directed acyclic graph and a continuous model that consists of poses
clustered on a Riemannian manifold. As mid level cues we propose two 3D human
pose estimation algorithms: one that estimates the 3D pose given a noisy 2D
estimation, and an approach that simultaneously estimates both the 2D and 3D
pose. Finally, we formulate higher level models built upon low and mid level
cues for understanding humans from single images. Concretely, we focus on two
different tasks in the context of fashion: semantic segmentation of clothing,
and predicting the fashionability from images with metadata to ultimately
provide fashion advice to the user. For all presented approaches we present
extensive results and comparisons against the state-of-the-art and show
significant improvements on the entire variety of tasks we tackle.
