content of the proton. We analyse the impact of the intrinsic charm in the

Our results indicated that differently from the other processes, the $Z+c$

Moreover, we propose the analysis of the ratios $R(Z+c/Z) \equiv

high-resolution manifolds have similar local geometrical structure, hence learn
local models on the lowresolution manifolds (e.g. sparse or locally linear
embedding models), which are then applied on the high-resolution manifold.
However, the low-resolution manifold is distorted by the oneto-many
relationship between low- and high- resolution patches. This paper presents a
method which learns linear models based on the local geometrical structure on
the high-resolution manifold rather than on the low-resolution manifold. For
this, in a first step, the low-resolution patch is used to derive a globally
optimal estimate of the high-resolution patch. The approximated solution is
shown to be close in Euclidean space to the ground-truth but is generally
smooth and lacks the texture details needed by state-ofthe-art face
recognizers. This first estimate allows us to find the support of the
high-resolution manifold using sparse coding (SC), which are then used as
support for learning a local projection (or upscaling) model between the
low-resolution and the highresolution manifolds using Multivariate Ridge
Regression (MRR). Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms six face super-resolution methods in terms of both recognition and
quality. These results also reveal that the recognition and quality are
significantly affected by the method used for stitching all super-resolved
patches together, where quilting was found to better preserve the texture
details which helps to achieve higher recognition rates.

An example implementation of SSD is the second order closure referred to as

the dynamics of wall turbulence and specifically the emergence and maintenance
of the roll/streak structure. This closure eliminates nonlinear interactions

dynamics to that of the mean equation and the interaction between the mean and
perturbation covariance. Here, this quasi-linear restriction of the dynamics is
used to study the structure and dynamics of turbulence in plane Poiseuille flow
at moderately high Reynolds numbers in a closely related dynamical system,
referred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) system. RNL simulations reveal
that the essential features of wall-turbulence dynamics are retained.
Remarkably, the RNL system spontaneously limits the support of its turbulence
to a small set of streamwise Fourier components giving rise to a naturally
minimal representation of its turbulence dynamics. Although greatly simplified,
this RNL turbulence exhibits natural-looking structures and statistics.
Surprisingly, even when further truncation of the perturbation support to a
single streamwise component is imposed the RNL system continues to produce
self-sustaining turbulent structure and dynamics. RNL turbulence at the
Reynolds numbers studied is dominated by the roll/streak structure in the
buffer layer and similar very-large-scale structure (VLSM) in the outer layer.
Diagnostics of the structure, spectrum and energetics of RNL and DNS turbulence
are used to demonstrate that the roll/streak dynamics supporting the turbulence
in the buffer and logarithmic layer is essentially similar in RNL and DNS.

Then, we design efficient linear-time algorithms for the optimizations.

Collider (LHC) at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. A resonant bump at a mass of around 750
GeV in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum is indicated and the corresponding
diphoton production cross section is around 3-10 fb. Motivated by the LHC
diphoton excess, we propose that the possible resonance candidate is a Higgs
singlet. To produce the Higgs singlet via gluon-gluon fusion process, we embed
the Higgs singlet in the framework of vector-like triplet quark (VLTQ) model.
As a result, the Higgs singlet decaying to diphoton final state is via VLTQ
loops. Using the enhanced number of new quarks and new Yukawa couplings of the
VLTQs and Higgs singlet, we successfully explain the diphoton production cross
section. We find that the width of the Higgs singlet is below 1 GeV, its
production cross section can be of order of 1 pb at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, and the
branching ratio for it decaying to diphoton is around $0.017$ and is
insensitive to the masses of VLTQs and new Yukawa couplings. We find a strong
correlation between the Higgs Yukawa couplings to $s$-$b$ and $c$-$t$; the
resulted branching ratio for $t \to c h$ can be $1.1\times 10^{-4}$ when the
constraint from $B_s$ oscillation is applied. With the constrained parameter
values, the signal strength for the SM Higgs decaying to diphoton is

self-energy of two-dimensional dipolar fermions is ultraviolet divergent. We
show that for electric dipoles this divergence can be avoided if one takes into

separated by a finite distance. Using this regularization, we calculate the

stars in prestellar cores. Here, we describe Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

We find the observed masses and multiplicities of stars can be recovered under
certain conditions.
  First, protostellar feedback from a star must be episodic. The continuous
accretion of disc material on to a central protostar results in local
temperatures which are too high for disc fragmentation. If, however, the
accretion occurs in intense outbursts, separated by a downtime of
$\sim10^4\,\mathrm{years}$, gravitational instabilities can develop and the
disc can fragment.
  Second, a significant amount of the cores' internal kinetic energy should be
in solenoidal turbulent modes. Cores with less than a third of their kinetic
energy in solenoidal modes have insufficient angular momentum to form
fragmenting discs. In the absence of discs, cores can fragment but results in a
top heavy distribution of masses with very few low mass objects.

We introduce JunctionSeq, a new method that builds on the statistical
techniques used by the well-established DEXSeq package to detect differential
usage of both exonic regions and splice junctions. In particular, JunctionSeq
is capable of detecting differentials in novel splice junctions without the
need for an additional isoform assembly step, greatly improving performance
when the available transcript annotation is flawed or incomplete. JunctionSeq
also provides a powerful and streamlined visualization toolset that allows
bioinformaticians to quickly and intuitively interpret their results. We tested
our method on publicly available data from several experiments performed on the
rat pineal gland and Toxoplasma gondii, successfully detecting known and
previously validated AIR genes in 19 out of 19 gene-level hypothesis tests. Due
to its ability to query novel splice sites, JunctionSeq is still able to detect
these differentials even when all alternative isoforms for these genes were not
included in the transcript annotation. JunctionSeq thus provides a powerful
method for detecting alternative isoform regulation even with low-quality
annotations. An implementation of JunctionSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor
package.

multi-color photometry allows us, for the first time, to show that the initial
peak cools from 22,000K to 8,000K over 15 rest-frame days, and is faster and
brighter than any published core-collapse supernova, reaching 30% of the
bolometric luminosity of the main peak. No physical Nickel powered model can
fit this initial peak. We show that a shock-cooling model followed by a
magnetar driving the second phase of the light curve can adequately explain the
entire light curve of DES14X3taz. Models involving the shock-cooling of
extended circumstellar material at a distance of ~400 solar radii are preferred
over the cooling of shock-heated surface layers of a stellar envelope. We
compare DES14X3taz to the few double-peaked SLSN-I events in the literature.

to inward quintuplet layers, burying it below an insulating surface layer. As a
consequence, the surface spectral function becomes weaker, but retains its
quasiparticle peak. This is in contrast to Gaussian disorder, which smears out
the quasiparticle peak completely. At the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, the effects
of Gaussian disorder can be reduced by removing surface adsorbates using neon
sputtering, which, however, introduces unitary scatterers. Since unitary

problems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black
box, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the
algorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the
number of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability.
Few-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa and
Grover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear
magnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting
circuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved
classically with a few oracle queries, and the attainable quantum advantage is
modest. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with
noise, using a five-qubit superconducting processor. Running classical and
quantum algorithms on the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in
favor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude
as a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates
that, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal
quantum computing, a quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy

exponential to at most quadratic in the complexity of the surface. We also
apply the main result to various other hierarchically hyperbolic groups and

$G/\langle\langle N\rangle\rangle$ is a relatively hierarchically hyperbolic

of HHSs, for example: the associated hyperbolic spaces are always obtained, up
to quasi-isometry, by coning off canonical coarse product regions in the

is local and non-dynamical, when integrated out it yields an effective
four-fermion interaction of the gravitational strength. We show how to
renormalize the theory, in the one-loop perturbative expansion in generally
curved space-times, obtaining the first order correction to the 2PI effective
action in Schwinger-Keldysh (${\it in-in}$) formalism. We then apply the
renormalized theory to study the dynamics of a collapsing universe that begins
in a thermal state and find that -- instead of a big crunch singularity -- the
Universe with torsion undergoes a ${\it bounce}$. We solve the dynamical
equations (a) classically (without particle production); (b) including the
production of fermions in a fixed background in the Hartree-Fock approximation
and (c) including the quantum backreaction of fermions onto the background
space-time. In the first and last cases the Universe undergoes a bounce. The
production of fermions due to the coupling to a contracting homogeneous
background speeds up the bounce, implying that the quantum contributions from
fermions is negative, presumably because fermion production contributes
negatively to the energy-momentum tensor. When compared with former works on

solving the corresponding Dirac equations) and quantum (in the sense that we

various field configurations. Pair production in inhomogeneous electric and

induced by nonlinear gravitational evolution. Interestingly, the halo-matter
cross bispectrum is not trivial even in this simple limit as it is strongly
sensitive to the scale-dependence of the quadratic and third-order halo bias.
Therefore, it can be used to test biasing prescriptions. We consider three
different prescription for halo clustering: excursion set peaks (ESP), local
bias and a model in which the halo bias parameters are explicitly derived from
a peak-background split. In all cases, the model parameters are fully
constrained with statistics other than the cross bispectrum. We measure the
cross bispectrum involving one halo fluctuation field and two mass overdensity

have derived an expression that can predict the extent of the induction. The
amount of induction is shown to be proportional to the square of the driving
force. The nature of the intervariable coupling for the induction effect has
similarities with the Onsager symmetry relations, though there is an important
sign difference as well as the magnitudes not being equal. Thermodynamic
induction adds nonlinear terms that improve the stability of stationary states,
at least within the VKC class of systems. Induction also produces a term in the
expression for the rate of entropy production that could be interpreted as
self-organization. Many of these results are also obtained using a variational

$\ell\ell\ell\gamma\eslash$ to probe dimension-5 operators coupling $S$ to
Standard Model gauge bosons. We consider a range of widths for $S$, from 5 GeV
to 45 GeV, and find that the three channels probe complementary regions of
parameter space and the suppression scale $\Lambda$. The finding of most
immediate relevance is that with 3 fb$^{-1}$, the LHC might already reveal new
excesses in the $\gamma\gamma\ell\ell$ channel and a 5(3) $\sigma$ discovery
may already be possible after collecting 65(25) fb$^{-1}$ of data with
$\ell\ell\ell\gamma\eslash$ events if the scale of the new physics is within
$\sim $ 9 TeV for couplings respecting 8 TeV LHC bounds and compatible with the
observed excess in diphotons for a wide resonance as suggested by the ATLAS
Collaboration. Beyond the EFT parametrization, we found realizations of models
with heavy vector-like quarks and leptons which can simultaneously fit the
diphoton excess and be discovered in the channels proposed here.

(NLS) equation on the line with symmetric nonzero boundary conditions at
infinity is characterized by using the recently developed inverse scattering
transform (IST) for such problems and by employing the nonlinear steepest
descent method of Deift and Zhou for oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems.
First, the IST is formulated over a single sheet of the complex plane without
introducing a uniformization variable. The solution of the focusing NLS
equation with nonzero boundary conditions is thus associated with a suitable
matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem whose jumps grow exponentially with time for
certain portions of the continuous spectrum. This growth is the signature of
the well-known modulational instability within the context of the IST. This
growth is then removed by suitable deformations of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
in the complex spectral plane. Asymptotically in time, the $xt$-plane is found
to decompose into two types of regions: a left far-field region and a right
far-field region, where the solution equals the condition at infinity to
leading order up to a phase shift, and a central region in which the asymptotic
behavior is described by slowly modulated periodic oscillations. In the latter
region, it is also shown that the modulus of the leading order solution, which
is initially obtained in the form of a ratio of Jacobi theta functions,
eventually reduces to the well-known elliptic solution of the focusing NLS
equation. These results provide the first characterization of the long-time
behavior of generic perturbations of a constant background in a modulationally
unstable medium.

functions. Recent experimental results suggest that transmembrane domains of

rigidities. We use molecular dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of
protein-embedded lipid membranes to investigate the mechanisms of protein
clustering. For a variety of protein concentrations, our simulations under
thermal equilibrium conditions reveal that the structural rigidity of
transmembrane domains dramatically affects interactions and changes the shape
of the cluster. We have observed stable large aggregates even in the absence of
hydrophobic mismatch which has been previously proposed as the mechanism of
protein aggregation. According to our results, semi-flexible proteins aggregate
to form two-dimensional clusters while rigid proteins, by contrast, form
one-dimensional string-like structures. By assuming two probable scenarios for
the formation of a two-dimensional triangular structure, we calculate the lipid
density around protein clusters and find that the difference in lipid
distribution around rigid and semiflexible proteins determines the one- or
two-dimensional nature of aggregates. It is found that lipids move faster
around semiflexible proteins than rigid ones. The aggregation mechanism
suggested in this paper can be tested by current state-of-the-art experimental

Polynomial Similarity Transformation Theory follows the philosophy of
traditional coupled cluster, left projecting the transformed Hamiltonian onto
subspaces of the Hilbert space in which the wave function variance is forced to

the next residual in the projective hierarchy. We rationalize and demonstrate
how and why coupled cluster doubles is ill suited to the strongly correlated

accurate wave functions with energy errors that in its best variant are smaller

coupling produces a tachyonic instability that leads to an exponential
enhancement of the gauge fields, which in turn can decay into observable scalar

perturbative constraints on axions coupled to gauge fields. We show how the

we point out that the constraints are parametrically weaker than one would

elongation and patterning of avian embryo body. Recent experiments link
gradient of presomitic mesoderm cell motility to displacement of the node and
body axis elongation. Ingression of new cells into presomitic mesoderm tissue
also contributes to the process. At present, movements of presomitic mesoderm
can be tracked at single cell precision. Yet, mechanisms that couple these
movements to regression and axis elongation are largely unknown. In this work
we develop a computational approach to study regression of Hensen's node and
the elongation of anterior-posterior body axis. Based on our simulations we
propose that regression and the elongation are a result of the influx of new
mesoderm cells mediated by cell density gradient. Addition of new cells leads
to expansion of tissue in anterior-posterior direction (elongation) and pushes
node towards posterior (regression). Motility gradient of cells further aids
regression by biasing tissue expansion towards more motile posterior. We show
that our model reproduces experimentally observed differences in presomitic
mesoderm cell movements and regression of Hensen's node in various embryo
phenotypes.

cooling of the neutron star or due to continued low-level accretion remains
unclear. In this work we use Swift data obtained after the long and bright 2011

investigate the hypothesis that cooling of the accretion-heated neutron star
crust dominates the quiescent thermal emission in Aql X-1. We demonstrate that
the X-ray light curves and measured neutron star surface temperatures are
consistent with the expectations of the crust cooling paradigm. By using a
thermal evolution code, we find that ~1.2-3.2 MeV/nucleon of shallow heat
release describes the observational data well, depending on the assumed
mass-accretion rate and temperature of the stellar core. We find no evidence
for varying strengths of this shallow heating after different outbursts, but
this could be due to limitations of the data. We argue that monitoring Aql X-1
for up to ~1 year after future outbursts can be a powerful tool to break model
degeneracies and solve open questions about the magnitude, depth and origin of
shallow heating in neutron star crusts.

expectation of observable transitions in the kinematics and stellar populations
on large scales. However, observing the faint galactic outskirts is
challenging, often leaving the transition unexplored. The large scale,
spatially-resolved stellar kinematic data from the SAGES Legacy Unifying
Galaxies and GlobularS (SLUGGS) survey are ideal for detecting kinematic
transitions. We present kinematic maps out to 2.6 effective radii on average,
kinemetry profiles, measurement of kinematic twists and misalignments, and the
average outer intrinsic shape of 25 SLUGGS galaxies. We find good overall
agreement in the kinematic maps and kinemetry radial profiles with literature.
We are able to confirm significant radial modulations in rotational versus
pressure support of galaxies with radius so that the central and outer
rotational properties may be quite different. We also test the suggestion that
galaxies may be more triaxial in their outskirts and find that while fast
rotating galaxies were already shown to be axisymmetric in their inner regions,
we are unable to rule out triaxiality in their outskirts. We compare our
derived outer kinematic information to model predictions from a two-phase
galaxy formation scenario. We find that the theoretical range of local outer
angular momentum agrees well with our observations, but that radial modulations

matter halo catalogues extracted from the BASICC simulation. The mock data are
analysed via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo likelihood analysis. We find a fitting
function that well describes the dependence of the error on bias, density and
volume, showing a decrease in the error as the bias and volume increase, and a
decrease with density down to an almost constant value for high density values.
This fitting formula allows us to produce forecasts on the precision achievable
with future surveys on measurements of the neutrino mass fraction. For example,
a Euclid-like spectroscopic survey should be able to measure the neutrino mass
fraction with an accuracy of $\delta f_{\nu} \approx 6.7\times10^{-4}$, using
redshift-space clustering once all the other cosmological parameters are kept
fixed to the $\Lambda$CDM case.

legislative behavior in important ways. The bulk of this research, however,
focuses on the way these characteristics shape an individual legislator's
behavior, making it less clear how they account for relationships between
legislators. We study the cosponsorship process in order to understand the race
and gender based dynamics underlying the relational component of
representation. Using a temporal exponential random graph model, we examine the
U.S. House cosponsorship network from 1981 through 2004. We find that Black and
Latino members of Congress are at a comparative disadvantage as a result of
race-based assortative mixing in the cosponsorship process, yet this
disadvantage is mitigated by the electoral pressures that all members face.
Members representing districts with significant racial and ethnic minority
populations are more likely to support their minority colleagues. We also find
that women members do not appear to face a similar disadvantage as a result of
their minority status. We argue that these race and gender dynamics in the
cosponsorship network are the result of both the inherent tendency towards
intra-group homophily in social networks and the electoral connection, which is
manifested here as members supporting minority colleagues to broaden their own
electoral base of support among minority constituencies.

  algorithm",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that the gradient descent algorithm converges linearly when
applied to a strongly convex function with Lipschitz gradient. In this case the
algorithm's rate of convergence is determined by the condition number of the
function. In a similar vein, it has been shown that a variant of the
Frank-Wolfe algorithm with away steps converges linearly when applied to a
strongly convex function with Lipschitz gradient over a polytope. In a nice
extension of the unconstrained case, the algorithm's rate of convergence is
determined by the product of the condition number of the function and a certain
condition number of the polytope.
  We shed new light into the latter type of polytope conditioning. In
particular, we show that previous and seemingly different approaches to define
a suitable condition measure for the polytope are essentially equivalent to
each other. Perhaps more interesting, they can all be unified via a parameter
of the polytope that formalizes a key premise linked to the algorithm's linear
convergence. We also give new insight into the linear convergence property. For
a convex quadratic objective, we show that the rate of convergence is
determined by a condition number of a suitably scaled polytope.

what-if analysis. Given a query, an analyst formulates $k$ hypotheticals, each
retaining some of the tuples of a database instance, possibly overlapping, and
she wishes to answer the query under scenarios, where a scenario is defined by
a subset of the hypotheticals that are ""turned on"". We say that a query admits
compact provisioning if given any database instance and any $k$ hypotheticals,
one can create a poly-size (in $k$) sketch that can then be used to answer the
query under any of the $2^{k}$ possible scenarios without accessing the
original instance.
  In this paper, we focus on provisioning complex queries that combine
relational algebra (the logical component), grouping, and statistics/analytics
(the numerical component). We first show that queries that compute quantiles or
linear regression (as well as simpler queries that compute count and
sum/average of positive values) can be compactly provisioned to provide
(multiplicative) approximate answers to an arbitrary precision. In contrast,
exact provisioning for each of these statistics requires the sketch size to be
exponential in $k$. We then establish that for any complex query whose logical
component is a positive relational algebra query, as long as the numerical
component can be compactly provisioned, the complex query itself can be
compactly provisioned. On the other hand, introducing negation or recursion in
the logical component again requires the sketch size to be exponential in $k$.
While our positive results use algorithms that do not access the original
instance after a scenario is known, we prove our lower bounds even for the case
when, knowing the scenario, limited access to the instance is allowed.

search for commonalities with other known superconductors. The present work
investigates the superconducting condensation energy, U, in the iron based
superconductors (IBS), and compares their U with a broad range of other
distinct classes of superconductor, including conventional BCS elements and
compounds and the unconventional heavy Fermion, Sr2RuO4, Li0.1ZrNCl,
kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 and optimally doped cuprate superconductors.
Surprisingly, both the magnitude and Tc dependence (U=0.1Tc**3.4 +- 0.2) of U
are, contrary to the previously observed behavior of the specific heat
discontinuity at Tc, deltaC, quite similar in the IBS and BCS materials for
Tc>1.4 K. In contrast, the heavy Fermion superconductors U vs Tc are strongly
(up to a factor of 100) enhanced above the IBS/BCS while the cuprate
superconductors U are strongly (factor of 8) reduced. However, scaling of U
with the specific heat gamma (or deltaC) brings all the superconductors
investigated onto one universal dependence upon Tc. This apparent universal
scaling U/gamma = 0.2Tc**2 for all superconductor classes investigated, both
weak and strong coupled and both conventional and unconventional, links
together extremely disparate behaviors over almost seven orders of magnitude
for U and almost three orders of magnitude for Tc. Since U has not yet been
explicitly calculated beyond the weak coupling limit, the present results can
help direct theoretical efforts into the medium and strong coupling regimes.

graph equipped with independent and identically distributed edge weights,
continuing the program initiated by Bhamidi and van der Hofstad [6]. We
describe our results in terms of a sequence of parameters $(s_n)_{n\geq 1}$
that quantifies the extreme-value behavior of small weights, and that describes
different universality classes for first passage percolation on the complete
graph. We consider both $n$-independent as well as $n$-dependent edge weights.
The simplest example consists of edge weights of the form $E^{s_n}$, where $E$
is an exponential random variable with mean 1.
  In this paper, we focus on the case where $s_n\rightarrow \infty$ with
$s_n=o(n^{1/3})$. Under mild regularity conditions, we identify the scaling
limit of the weight of the smallest-weight path between two uniform vertices,
and we prove that the number of edges in this path obeys a central limit
theorem with asymptotic mean $s_n\log{(n/s_n^3)}$ and variance
$s_n^2\log{(n/s_n^3)}$. This settles a conjecture of Bhamidi and van der
Hofstad [6]. The proof relies on a decomposition of the smallest-weight tree
into an initial part following invasion percolation dynamics, and a main part
following branching process dynamics. The initial part has been studied in
[14]; the current article focuses on the global branching dynamics.

associated with higher temperatures and then in those associated with lower.
The time delays between the different narrowband EUV channels have been
measured for many individual loops and recently for every pixel of an active
region observation. Time delays between channels for an active region exhibit a
wide range of values, with maxima $>$ 5,000\,s. These large time delays make up
3-26\% (depending on the channel pair) of the pixels where a significant,
positive time delay is measured. It has been suggested that time delays can be
explained by impulsive heating. In this paper, we investigate whether the
largest observed time delays can be explained by this hypothesis by simulating
a series of coronal loops with different heating rates, loop lengths,
abundances, and geometries to determine the range of expected time delays
between a set of four EUV channels. We find that impulsive heating cannot
address the largest time delays observed in two of the channel pairs and that
the majority of the large time delays can only be explained by long, expanding
loops with photospheric abundances. Additional observations may rule out these
simulations as an explanation for the long time delays. We suggest that either
the time delays found in this manner may not be representative of real loop
evolution, or that the impulsive heating and cooling scenario may be too simple
to explain the observations and other heating scenarios must be explored.

Yet the phase boundaries predicted by different approximations vary greatly,

treats all competing many-body instabilities in the particle-particle and

quantify potential biases, which are essential for accurate computation of
planetary occurrence rates. With respect to the cumulative Kepler Object of
Interest (KOI) catalog, we designate 1,478 new KOIs, of which 402 are
dispositioned as planet candidates (PCs). Also, 237 KOIs dispositioned as false
positives (FPs) in previous Kepler catalogs have their disposition changed to
PC and 118 PCs have their disposition changed to FP. This brings the total
number of known KOIs to 8,826 and PCs to 4,696. We compare the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI
catalog to previous KOI catalogs, as well as ancillary Kepler catalogs, finding
good agreement between them. We highlight new PCs that are both potentially
rocky and potentially in the habitable zone of their host stars, many of which
orbit solar-type stars. This work represents significant progress in accurately
determining the fraction of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of
Sun-like stars. The full catalog is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet

Compact Dwarfs (BCDs). We present CO(1-0) and (2-1) observations, further
supplemented with additional CO measurements and multiwavelength ancillary data
from the literature. We find the CO luminosity to be correlated with the
stellar and HI masses, SFR tracers, the size of the starburst and its
metallicity. BCDs appear offset from the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law, showing
extremely low ($\lesssim$0.1 Gyr) H2 and H2+HI depletion timescales. The
departure from the SK law is smaller when considering H2+HI rather than H2
only, and is larger for BCDs with lower metallicity and higher specific SFR.
Thus, the molecular fraction and H2 depletion timescale of BCDs is found to be
strongly correlated with metallicity. Using this and assuming that the
empirical correlation found between the specific SFR and galaxy-averaged H2
depletion timescale of more metal-rich galaxies extends to lower masses, we
derive a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor $\alpha_{CO, Z}
\propto (Z/Z_{\odot})^{-y}$, with $y=1.5(\pm 0.3)$ in qualitative agreement
with previous determinations, dust-based measurements, and recent model
predictions. Our results suggest that in vigorously star-forming dwarfs the
fraction of H2 traced by CO decreases by a factor of about 40 from $Z \sim
Z_{\odot}$ to $Z \sim 0.1 Z_{\odot}$, leading to a strong underestimation of
the H2 mass in metal-poor systems when a Galactic $\alpha_{CO, MW}$ is
considered. Adopting $\alpha_{CO, Z}$ we find that departures from the SK law
are partially resolved. Our results suggest that starbursting dwarfs have
shorter depletion gas timescales and lower molecular fractions compared to
normal late-type disc galaxies even accounting for the molecular gas not traced
by CO emission in metal-poor environments, raising additional constraints to
model predictions (Abridged).

cone in a finite-dimensional vector space $V$.
  This projection and rescaling algorithm is inspired by previous work on
rescaled versions of the perceptron algorithm and by Chubanov's
projection-based method for linear feasibility problems. As in these
predecessors, each main iteration of our algorithm contains two steps: a {\em
basic procedure} and a {\em rescaling} step. When $L \cap \Omega \ne
\emptyset$, the projection and rescaling algorithm finds a point $x \in L \cap
\Omega$ in at most $O(\log(1/\delta(L \cap \Omega)))$ iterations, where
$\delta(L \cap \Omega) \in (0,1]$ is a measure of the most interior point in $L
\cap \Omega$. The ideal value $\delta(L\cap \Omega) = 1$ is attained when $L
\cap \Omega$ contains the center of the symmetric cone $\Omega$.
  We describe several possible implementations for the basic procedure
including a perceptron scheme and a smooth perceptron scheme. The perceptron
scheme requires $O(r^4)$ perceptron updates and the smooth perceptron scheme
requires $O(r^2)$ smooth perceptron updates, where $r$ stands for the Jordan

The new spacecraft pointing method now gives typical roll motion of 1.0 pixels
peak-to-peak over 6 hours at the edges of the field, two orders of magnitude
greater than for Kepler. Despite these roll errors, the flight system and its
modified science data processing pipeline restores much of the photometric
precision of the primary mission while viewing a wide variety of targets, thus
turning adversity into diversity. We define metrics for data compression and
pixel budget available in each campaign; the photometric noise on exoplanet
transit and stellar activity time scales; residual correlations in corrected
long cadence light curves; and the protection of test sinusoidal signals from
overfitting in the systematic error removal process. We find that data
compression and noise both increase linearly with radial distance from the
center of the field of view, with the data compression proportional to star
count as well. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the
limiting 6 hour photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star can be as
low as 30 ppm, only 25% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is
achieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the
data are attenuated by less than 10% for signals with periods up 15 days. At
time scales relevant to asteroseismology, light curves derived from K2 archive
calibrated pixels have high-frequency noise amplitude within 40% of that
achieved by Kepler. The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis
resulting from 1.5 yr of experience with this new mission concept, and
quantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's
already high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.

Yu, 2014). We suppose that the population is divided into two genetic types,
$a$ and $A$, and consider the proportion of the population which is of type $a$
at each spatial location. If we let both the selection intensity and the
fraction of individuals replaced during reproduction events tend to zero, the
process can be rescaled so as to converge to the solution to a
reaction-diffusion equation (typically the Fisher-KPP equation, as in
Etheridge, Veber and Yu, 2014). We show that the rescaled fluctuations converge
in distribution to the solution to a linear stochastic partial differential
equation. Depending on whether offspring dispersal is only local or if large
scale extinction-recolonization events are allowed to take place, the limiting
equation is either the stochastic heat equation with a linear drift term driven
by space-time white noise or the corresponding fractional heat equation driven
by a coloured noise which is white in time. If individuals are diploid (i.e.
either $AA$, $Aa$ or $aa$) and if natural selection favours heterozygous ($Aa$)
individuals, a stable intermediate gene frequency is maintained in the
population. We give estimates for the asymptotic effect of random fluctuations
around the equilibrium frequency on the local average fitness in the
population. In particular, we find that the size of this effect - known as the
drift load - depends crucially on the dimension $d$ of the space in which the
population evolves, and is reduced relative to the case without spatial

coherently strained SrCoO2.5 thin films and performed post-annealing at various

multi-core scalability of high throughput transactional database systems,
modern systems still fail to achieve scalable throughput for workloads
involving frequent access to highly contended data. Most of this inability to
achieve high throughput is explained by the fundamental constraints involved in
guaranteeing ACID --- the addition of cores results in more concurrent
transactions accessing the same contended data for which access must be
serialized in order to guarantee isolation. Thus, linear scalability for
contended workloads is impossible. However, there exist flaws in many modern
architectures that exacerbate their poor scalability, and result in throughput
that is much worse than fundamentally required by the workload.
  In this paper we identify two prevalent design principles that limit the
multi-core scalability of many (but not all) transactional database systems on
contended workloads: the multi-purpose nature of execution threads in these
systems, and the lack of advanced planning of data access. We demonstrate the
deleterious results of these design principles by implementing a prototype
system, ORTHRUS, that is motivated by the principles of separation of database
component functionality and advanced planning of transactions. We find that
these two principles alone result in significantly improved scalability on
high-contention workloads, and an order of magnitude increase in throughput for
a non-trivial subset of these contended workloads.

propose a random caching and multicasting scheme with a design parameter. By
carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate

maximization, which is a very complex non-convex problem in general. Using
optimization techniques, we develop an iterative numerical algorithm to obtain
a local optimal caching and multicasting design in the general region. To
reduce complexity and maintain superior performance, we also derive an
asymptotically optimal caching and multicasting design in the asymptotic

simulations show that the asymptotically optimal design achieves a significant
gain in successful transmission probability over some baseline schemes in the

this general systematization is actually effective, i.e. useful in revealing

Preprint for submission in Automatica",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies a pursuit-evasion problem involving a single pursuer and a
single evader, where we are interested in developing a pursuit strategy that
doesn't require continuous, or even periodic, information about the position of
the evader. We propose a self-triggered control strategy that allows the
pursuer to sample the evader's position autonomously, while satisfying desired
performance metric of evader capture. The work in this paper builds on the
previously proposed self-triggered pursuit strategy which guarantees capture of
the evader in finite time with a finite number of evader samples. However, this
algorithm relied on the unrealistic assumption that the evader's exact position
was available to the pursuer. Instead, we extend our previous framework to
develop an algorithm which allows for uncertainties in sampling the information
about the evader, and derive tolerable upper-bounds on the error such that the
pursuer can guarantee capture of the evader. In addition, we outline the
advantages of retaining the evader's history in improving the current estimate
of the true location of the evader that can be used to capture the evader with
even less samples. Our approach is in sharp contrast to the existing works in
literature and our results ensure capture without sacrificing any performance
in terms of guaranteed time-to-capture, as compared to classic algorithms that
assume continuous availability of information.

the Fourier plane. A possible remedy can be found in the promising new theory
of compressed sensing (CS), which allows for the accurate recovery of sparse
signals from sub-Nyquist sampling given certain measurement conditions. We
provide an introductory assessment of optimal arrays for CS in snapshot-mode
radio interferometry, using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), a widely used CS
recovery algorithm similar in some respects to CLEAN. We focus on centrally
condensed (specifically, Gaussian) arrays versus uniform arrays, and the
principle of randomization versus deterministic arrays such as the VLA. The
theory of CS is grounded in $a)$ sparse representation of signals and $b)$
measurement matrices of low coherence. We calculate a related quantity, mutual
coherence (MC), as a theoretical indicator of arrays' suitability for OMP based
on the recovery error bounds in (Donoho et al. 2006). OMP reconstructions of
both point and extended objects are also run from simulated incomplete data.
Optimal arrays are considered for object recovery through 1) the natural pixel
representation and 2) the representation by the block discrete cosine transform
(BDCT). We find that reconstructions of the pixel representation perform best
with the uniform random array, while reconstructions of the BDCT representation
perform best with normal random arrays. Slight randomization to the VLA also
improves it hugely for CS with the pixel basis. In the pixel basis, array
design for CS reflects known principles of array design for small numbers of
antennas, namely of randomness and uniform distribution. Differing results with
the BDCT, however, emphasize the importance of studying how sparsifying bases
affect array design before CS can be optimized.

gas. The H2 emission line fluxes can be accounted for by fluorescence in most
of the observed galaxies. We find a decrease of the H2 2.122mum emission line

indicates an efficient destruction of H2 by the stellar UV radiation. The
intensities of the [FeII] 1.257mum and 1.644mum emission lines in the spectra

protolunar disk (PLD). With the use of published data on the chemical
composition of the PLD, along with existing analytical models of the disk
structure, we show that the high temperatures that were prevalent in the disk
would have led to ionization of Na, K, SiO, Zn and, to a lesser extent, O$_2$.
We assume that the disk has a vapor structure. The resulting ionization
fractions, together with a relatively weak magnetic field, would have been
sufficient to trigger the magneto-rotational instability, or MRI. We calculate
the intensity of the resulting magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, as parameterized
by the dimensionless ratio $\alpha$ of turbulent stresses to gas pressure, and
obtain maximum values $\alpha\sim 10^{-2}$ along most of the vertical extent of
the disk, and at different orbital radii. Under these conditions, turbulent
mixing within the PLD due to the MRI was likely capable of transporting
isotopic and chemical species efficiently. To test these results in a
conservative manner, we carry out a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of
a small, rectangular patch of the PLD, located at 4 Earth radii ($r_{\rm E}$)
from the center of the Earth, and assuming once again that the disk is
completely gaseous. We obtain turbulence with an average intensity $\alpha\sim
7\times 10^{-6}$ over the course of 280 orbital periods (133 days at
4$r_{\rm{E}}$). Despite this relatively low value of $\alpha$, the effective
turbulent diffusivity of a passive tracer introduced in the flow is large
enough to allow the tracer to spread across a radial distance of $10r_{\rm{E}}$
in $\sim13-129$ yr, less than the estimated cooling time of the PLD of
$\sim250$ yr. Further improvements to our model will need to incorporate the
energy balance in the disk, a complete two-phase structure, and a more
realistic equation of state.

by experiments in donor-acceptor organic compounds with a neutral-ionic phase
transition coupled to the spontaneous lattice dimerization and to charge
transfer excitons. The double nature of the ensemble of excitons leads to an
intricate time evolution, in particular to macroscopic quantum oscillations
from the interference between the Bose condensate of excitons and the ground
state of the excitonic insulator. The coupling of excitons and the order

displays an off-equilibrium scaling behavior close to the transition line ${\bm

$t_s$, and the finite size $L$. The scaling behavior can be parametrized in
terms of the scaling variables $t_s^\kappa/L$ and $t/t_s^{\kappa_t}$, where
$\kappa>0$ and $\kappa_t > 0$ are appropriate universal exponents, which differ
at the critical point and for $T < T_c$. In the latter case, $\kappa$ and

tasks. A number of frameworks have been developed to expedite the process of
designing and training deep neural networks (DNNs), such as Caffe, Torch and
Theano. Currently they can harness multiple GPUs on a single machine, but are
unable to use GPUs that are distributed across multiple machines; as even
average-sized DNNs can take days to train on a single GPU with 100s of GBs to
TBs of data, distributed GPUs present a prime opportunity for scaling up DL.
However, the limited bandwidth available on commodity Ethernet networks
presents a bottleneck to distributed GPU training, and prevents its trivial
realization.
  To investigate how to adapt existing frameworks to efficiently support
distributed GPUs, we propose Poseidon, a scalable system architecture for
distributed inter-machine communication in existing DL frameworks. We integrate
Poseidon with Caffe and evaluate its performance at training DNNs for object
recognition. Poseidon features three key contributions that accelerate DNN
training on clusters: (1) a three-level hybrid architecture that allows
Poseidon to support both CPU-only and GPU-equipped clusters, (2) a distributed
wait-free backpropagation (DWBP) algorithm to improve GPU utilization and to
balance communication, and (3) a structure-aware communication protocol (SACP)
to minimize communication overheads. We empirically show that Poseidon
converges to same objectives as a single machine, and achieves state-of-art
training speedup across multiple models and well-established datasets using a
commodity GPU cluster of 8 nodes (e.g. 4.5x speedup on AlexNet, 4x on
GoogLeNet, 4x on CIFAR-10). On the much larger ImageNet22K dataset, Poseidon
with 8 nodes achieves better speedup and competitive accuracy to recent

often very low so that frequentist methods may result in problems. Bayesian
inference is attractive as informative priors that add small amount of
information can stabilise the analysis without overwhelming the data. However,
Bayesian analysis is often computationally demanding and the selection of the
prior for the covariance matrix of the bivariate structure is crucial with
little data. The integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) method
provides an efficient solution to the computational issues by avoiding any
sampling, but the important question of priors remain. We explore the penalised
complexity (PC) prior framework for specifying informative priors for the
variance parameters and the correlation parameter. PC priors facilitate model
interpretation and hyperparameter specification as expert knowledge can be
incorporated intuitively. We conduct a simulation study to compare the
properties and behaviour of differently defined PC priors to currently used
priors in the field. The simulation study shows that the use of PC priors
results in more precise estimates when specified in a sensible neighbourhood

efficiency $f_{\star}$ of dark matter halos at $z>6$ that matches the measured
galaxy luminosity functions at these redshifts. We find that $f_{\star}$ peaks

qualitative agreement with its behavior at lower redshifts. We then investigate
the cosmic star formation histories and the corresponding models of

variety of observations to further constrain the characteristics of the galaxy
populations, including the escape fraction of UV photons. Our approach provides
an empirically-calibrated, physically-motivated model for the properties of
star-forming galaxies sourcing the epoch of reionization. In the case where
star formation in low-mass halos is maximally efficient, an average escape
fraction $\sim0.1$ can reproduce the optical depth reported by Planck, whereas
inefficient star formation in these halos requires either about twice as many
UV photons to escape, or an escape fraction that increases towards higher
redshifts. Our models also predict how future observations with JWST can

energy-dependent coupling function $\Gamma(\varepsilon) \propto
|\varepsilon|^r$. Recently, a rich phase diagram has been found in this
Bose-Fermi Anderson model, where the transitions between competing ground
states are governed by quantum critical points. In addition to a transition
between a Kondo singlet and a local moment, a localized phase has been
established once the coupling to a sub-ohmic bosonic bath exceeds a critical
value. Using the time-dependent numerical renormalization group approach, we
show that the non-equilibrium dynamics with F-type of bath exponents can be
fully understand within an effective single-impurity Anderson model using a
renormalized local Coulomb interaction $U_{\rm ren}$. For regimes with B-type
of bath exponents, the nature of the bosonic bath and the coupling strength has
a profound impact on the electron dynamics which can only partially be
understood using an appropriate $U_{\rm ren}$. The local expectation values
always reach a steady state at very long times. By a scaling analysis for
$\Lambda \to 1^+$, we find thermalization of the system only in the strong
coupling regime. In the local moment and in the localized phase significant
deviations between the steady-state value and the thermal equilibrium value are
found that are related to the distance to the quantum critical point.

perpetual wireless sensor networks. Through the action of controllable Energy
Transmitters (ETs) that operate at-a-distance, the sensors can be re-charged by
harvesting the radiated RF energy. However, both the charging rate and
effective charging range of the ETs are limited, and thus multiple ETs are
required to cover large areas. While this action increases the amount of
wireless energy injected into the network, there are certain areas where the RF
energy combines destructively. To address this problem, we propose a
duty-cycled random-phase multiple access (DRAMA). Non-intuitively, our approach
relies on deliberately generating random interferences, both destructive and
constructive, at the destination nodes. We demonstrate that DRAMA optimizes the
power conversion efficiency, and the total amount of energy harvested. Through
real-testbed experiments, we prove that our proposed scheme provides
significant advantages over the current state of the art in our considered

Incremental SFM methods are most popular for the basic structure recovery of a

approach begins with quickly building a coarse 3D model using only a fraction
of features from given images. The coarse model is then enriched by localizing
remaining images and matching and triangulating remaining features in

leveraging the geometry of the coarse model. Our method produces similar

Einstein, I attempt to tackle some open issues in modern cosmology, via a toy
but non-trivial model. Specifically, I would like to link together: (i) the
smallness of the cosmological constant today, (ii) the evolution of the
universe from an inflationary era after the big-bang till now, and (iii) local
supersymmetry in the gravitational sector (supergravity) with a broken spectrum
at early eras, by making use of the concept of the ""running vacuum"" in the
context of a simple toy model of four-dimensional N=1 supergravity. The model
is characterised by dynamically broken local supersymmetry, induced by the
formation of gravitino condensates in the early universe. As I will argue,
there is a Starobinsky-type inflationary era characterising the broken
supersymmetry phase in this model, which is compatible with the current
cosmological data, provided a given constraint is satisfied among some
tree-level parameters of the model and the renormalised cosmological constant
of the de Sitter background used in the analysis. Applying the ""running vacuum""
concept, then, to the effective field theory at the exit of inflation, makes a
smooth connection (in cosmic time) with the radiation dominance epoch and
subsequently with the current era of the Universe, characterised by a small
(but dominant) cosmological-constant contribution to the cosmic energy density.
In this approach, the smallness of the cosmological constant today is
attributed to the failure (due to quantum gravity non-perturbative effects) of
the aforementioned constraint.

dependence on the spin supplementary condition. We decomposed the equations in
the orthonormal tetrad based on the time-like vector fixing the spin condition
and on the corresponding spin, while representing the curvature in terms of the
Weyl scalars obtained in the Newman--Penrose (NP) null tetrad naturally
associated with the orthonormal one; the projections thus obtained did not
contain the Weyl scalars $\Psi_0$ and $\Psi_4$. In the present paper, we choose
the interpretation tetrad in a different way, attaching it to the tangent
$u^\mu$ of the world-line representing the history of the spinning body.
Actually {\em two} tetrads are suggested, both given ""intrinsically"" by the
problem and each of them incompatible with one specific spin condition. The
decomposition of the MPD equation, again supplemented by writing its right-hand
side in terms of the Weyl scalars, is slightly less efficient than in the
massive case, because $u^\mu$ cannot be freely chosen (in contrast to $V^\mu$)
and so the $u^\mu$-based tetrad is less flexible. In the second part of this
paper, a similar analysis is performed for massless spinning particles; in
particular, a certain ""intrinsic"" interpretation tetrad is again found. The
respective decomposition of the MPD equation of motion is considerably simpler
than in the massive case, containing only $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$ scalars and not
the cosmological constant. An option to span the spin-bivector eigen-plane,
besides the world-line null tangent, by a main principal null direction of the

has become a pest when it appeared in Japan, Korea, and the United States. In
Europe it was first found in Italy, in 2002. In 1982 the host-specific
parasitoid \emph{Torymus sinensis} was introduced in Japan, in an attempt to
achieve a biological control of the pest. After an apparent initial success,
the two species seem to have locked in predator-prey cycles of decadal length.
We have developed a spatially explicit mathematical model that describes the
seasonal time evolution of the adult insect populations, and the competition
for finding egg deposition sites. In a spatially homogeneous situation the
model reduces to an iterated map for the egg density of the two species. While
the map would suggest, for realistic parameters, that both species should
become locally extinct (somewhat corroborating the hypothesis of biological
control), the full model, for the same parameters, shows that the introduction
of \emph{T. sinensis} sparks a traveling wave of the parasitoid population that
destroys the pest on its passage. Depending on the value of the diffusion
coefficients of the two species, the pest can later be able to re-colonize the
empty area left behind the wave. When this occurs the two populations do not
seem to attain a state of spatial homogeneity, but produce an ever-changing
pattern of traveling waves.

smooth geometries (i.e. slabs, spheres or cylinders) with well-defined

naturally occurring materials, where the pore geometry can differ substantially
from these ideal shapes. In this paper the effect of surface roughness on the

electrostatic approach it is found that the effective surface relaxivity can
increase dramatically in the presence of rough surfaces. This leads to a
situation where the system responds as a smooth pore, but with significantly
increased surface relaxivity. As a result: the standard approach of assuming an
idealized geometry with known surface-to-volume and inverting the T2 relaxation
spectrum to a pore size distribution is no longer valid. The effective
relaxivity is found to be fairly insensitive to the shape of roughness but
strongly dependent on the width and depth of the surface topology.

general relativistic approach in which classical trajectories of relativistic

approximation, applied to focused current beams, allows us to directly compare
the wave and the particle pictures. We obtain very good numerical agreement
between the quantum and the classical approaches for a fairly wide set of

method offers an enormous reduction of complexity from irregular tight-binding
Hamiltonians defined on large lattices to geometric language for curved

predicting electronic transport properties in graphene nanostructures with

$m$ and a distinct particle of mass $m_1$ in the universal limit of zero-range
two-body interaction is studied. For the unambiguous formulation of the problem
in the interval $\mu_r < m/m_1 \le \mu_c$ ($\mu_r \approx 8.619$ and $\mu_c
\approx 13.607$) an additional parameter $b$ determining the wave function near
the triple-collision point is introduced; thus, a one-parameter family of
self-adjoint Hamiltonians is defined. The dependence of the bound-state
energies on $m/m_1$ and $b$ in the sector of angular momentum and parity $L^P =
1^-$ is calculated and analysed with the aid of a simple model.

complete local domain R so that the existence of such a closure operation is
equivalent to the existence of a big Cohen-Macaulay module. These closure
operations are called Dietz closures. In complete rings of characteristic p >
0, tight closure and plus closure satisfy the axioms. In order to study these
closures, we define module closures and discuss their properties. For many of
these properties, there is a smallest closure operation satisfying the
property. We discuss properties of big Cohen-Macaulay module closures, and
prove that every Dietz closure is contained in a big Cohen-Macaulay module
closure. Using this result, we show that under mild conditions, a ring R is
regular if and only if all Dietz closures on R are trivial. Finally, we show
that solid closure in equal characteristic 0, integral closure, and regular
closure are not Dietz closures, and that all Dietz closures are contained in
liftable integral closure.

series of Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces with
simple (Kleinian) singularities. For a quotient surface C^2/G with G a finite
subgroup of SL(2, C), we conjecture a formula for this generating series in
terms of Lie-theoretic data, which is compatible with existing results for type
A singularities. We announce a proof of our conjecture for singularities of
type D. The generating series in our conjecture can be seen as a specialized
character of the basic representation of the corresponding (extended) affine
Lie algebra; we discuss possible representation-theoretic consequences of this
fact. Our results, respectively conjectures, imply the modularity of the
generating function for surfaces with type A and type D, respectively
arbitrary, simple singularities, confirming predictions of S-duality.

  Network Search","14 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a classic search problem first proposed by S. Gal in which a
Searcher randomizes between unit speed paths on a network, aiming to find a
hidden point in minimal expected time in the worst case. This can be viewed as
a zero-sum game between the Searcher and a time maximizing Hider. It is a
natural model for many search problems such as search and rescue operations;
the search for an enemy, a bomb or weapons in a military context; or
predator-prey search. A Chinese Postman Tour (CPT) is a minimal time tour of
the network that searches all the arcs and a Random Chinese Postman Tour (RCPT)
is an equiprobable choice of any given CPT and its reverse. The full class of
networks for which a RCPT is optimal is known, but otherwise little is known
about the solution of the game except in some special cases that have
complicated optimal strategies that would be impractical to implement. The
question of how well a RCPT or any other search strategy performs for general
networks has never been analyzed. We show that a RCPT has an approximation
ratio of $4/3$: that is, the maximum expected time it takes to find a point on
the network is no greater than $4/3$ times that of the optimal search strategy.
We then examine the performance of a RCPT in a related search game recently
proposed by S. Alpern in which the Searcher must return to his starting point
after finding the Hider.

discussed here: - the center of masses of non-symmetric rigid body is assumed
to be located at the equatorial plane on axis Oy which is perpendicular to the
main principal axis Ox of inertia at the fixed point. Such a case was presented
in the rotating coordinate system, in a frame of reference fixed in the
rotating body for the case of rotation over the fixed point (at given initial
conditions). In our derivation, we have represented the generalized Euler case
in the fixed Cartesian coordinate system; so, the motivation of our ansatz is
to elegantly transform the proper components of the previously presented
solution from one (rotating) coordinate system to another (fixed) Cartesian
coordinates. Besides, we have obtained an elegantly analytical case of general
type of rotations; also, we have presented it in the fixed Cartesian coordinate
system via Euler angles.
