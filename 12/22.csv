$k$ of them sum to zero. The problem is of tremendous importance in the
emerging field of complexity theory within $P$, and it is in particular open
whether it admits an algorithm of complexity $O(n^c)$ with $c<\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil$. Inspired by an algorithm due to Meiser (1993), we show
that there exist linear decision trees and algebraic computation trees of depth
$O(n^3\log^3 n)$ solving $k$-SUM. Furthermore, we show that there exists a
randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil+8})$
time, and performs $O(n^3\log^3 n)$ linear queries on the input. Thus, we show
that it is possible to have an algorithm with a runtime almost identical (up to
the $+8$) to the best known algorithm but for the first time also with the
number of queries on the input a polynomial that is independent of $k$. The
$O(n^3\log^3 n)$ bound on the number of linear queries is also a tighter bound
than any known algorithm solving $k$-SUM, even allowing unlimited total time
outside of the queries. By simultaneously achieving few queries to the input
without significantly sacrificing runtime vis-\`{a}-vis known algorithms, we
deepen the understanding of this canonical problem which is a cornerstone of
complexity-within-$P$.
  We also consider a range of tradeoffs between the number of terms involved in
the queries and the depth of the decision tree. In particular, we prove that
there exist $o(n)$-linear decision trees of depth $o(n^4)$.

data influence both the translational dynamics and proper time rates of
observers. These different proper time rates cause a variability of the time
transfer observable beyond that caused by their translational (and rotational)
dynamics. With the near-future implementation of (interplanetary) transponder
laser ranging, these effects will become increasingly important, requiring a
re-evaluation of the common data analysis practice of using a priori time
ephemerides, which is the goal of this paper.
  We develop a framework for the simultaneous estimation of the initial
translational state and the initial proper time of an observer, with the goal
of facilitating robust tracking data analysis from next-generation space
missions carrying highly accurate clocks and tracking equipment. Using our
approach, the influence of physical parameters on both translational and time
dynamics are considered at the same level in the analysis, and mutual
correlations between the signatures of the two are automatically identified. We
perform a covariance analysis using our proposed method with simulated laser
data from Earth-based stations to both a Mars and Mercury lander.
  Using four years of tracking data for the Mars lander simulations, we find a
difference between our results using the simultaneous space-time dynamics
estimation and the classical analysis technique (with an ta priori time
ephemeris) of around 0.1 % in formal errors and correlation coefficients. For a
Mercury lander this rises to around 1% for a 1-month mission and 10 % for a
4-year mission. By means of Monte Carlo simulation, we find that using an a
priori time ephemeris of representative accuracy will result in estimation
errors that are orders of magnitude above the formal error when processing
highly accurate laser time transfer data.

off-shell reduction from four to three space-time dimensions for supergravity

enhanced to local [SU(2) x SU(2)]/Z2 =SO(4) and the c-map is effected by a
parity transformation in the internal space that interchanges the two SU(2)
factors. Vector and tensor supermultiplets are each others conjugate under the
c-map and both can be dualized in three dimensions to (on-shell)

to a clarification of many of the intricate issues that play a role in the
c-map. The results for off-shell Lagrangians quadratic in space-time
derivatives are analyzed in detail and compared to the literature. The
underlying reasons are identified why not all of the four-dimensional tensor

off-shell approach is, that it also enables a systematic analysis of theories

under the c-map. In principle, explicit results for realistic four-dimensional

unstable towards developing nematicity (breaking of the $C_4$ symmetry). This

and the possible existence of free will. We analyze a simple closed causal loop
ensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic
time arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other.
The loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus
forecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law
therefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is
not revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution
is demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the Two-State-Vector
Formalism (TSVF), where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future
choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been
actually made. To quantify this assertion, ""weak information"" is described in
terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does
not exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level,
particles can be thought of as weakly interacting according to their past and
future states, but causality remains intact as long as the future is masked by
quantum indeterminism.

ATLAS and CMS collaborations and the BLMSSM is one of them. The BLMSSM is an
extension of the minimal supersymmetric model where baryon and lepton numbers
are local gauge symmetries. We analyze the decay channels $\Phi\rightarrow gg$,
$\Phi\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$, $\Phi\rightarrow Z\gamma$, and $\Phi\rightarrow
\bar{t}t,\;VV\;(V=Z,\;W)$ with the mass of the CP-odd scalar $\Phi=A_{_B}^0$
being around $750\;{\rm GeV}$ in this model. Within a certain parameter space,
the scenario can account for the experimental data on the diphoton excess.

study of exoplanet atmospheres, and has lead to the detection of a small number
of elements and molecules (Na, K, H$_2$O), but also revealed that many planets
show flat transmission spectra consistent with the presence of opaque
high-altitude hazes or clouds.
  Aims: We apply this technique to the $M_P=0.38 M_{jup}$, $R_p=1.12 R_{jup}$,
$P=2.78d$ planet WASP-49b, aiming to characterize its transmission spectrum
between 0.73 and 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m and search for the features of K and H$_2$O.
  Methods: Three transits of WASP-49b have been observed with the FORS2
instrument installed at the VLT/UT1 telescope at the ESO Paranal site. We used
FORS2 in MXU mode with grism GRIS_600z, producing simultaneous multiwavelength
transit lightcurves throughout the i' and z' bands. We combined these data with
independent broadband photometry from the Euler and TRAPPIST telescopes to
obtain a good measurement of the transit shape. Strong correlated noise
structures are present in the FORS2 lightcurves, which are due to rotating
flat-field structures that are introduced by inhomogeneities of the linear
atmospheric dispersion corrector's transparency. We accounted for these
structures by constructing common noise models from the residuals of
lightcurves bearing the same noise structures, and used them together with
simple parametric models to infer the transmission spectrum.
  Results: We present three independent transmission spectra of WASP-49b
between 0.73 and 1.02 $\mu m$, as well as a transmission spectrum between 0.65
and 1.02 $\mu m$ from the combined analysis of FORS2 and broadband data. The
results obtained from the three individual epochs agree well. The transmission
spectrum of WASP-49b is best fit by atmospheric models containing a cloud deck
at pressure levels of 1 mbar or lower.

thus has features in common with nonleptonic weak decays of hyperons. Thanks to
the expected pure S-wave nature of the decay in question in the heavy $b$ quark

The objective of our research was to check whether scalar fields can serve as
time variables during a dynamical evolution of a coupled multi-component
matter-geometry system. We concentrated on a neutral case, which means that the
elaborated system was not charged electrically nor magnetically. For this
purpose, we investigated a gravitational collapse of a self-interacting complex
and real scalar fields in the Brans-Dicke theory using the 2+2 spacetime
foliation. We focused mainly on the region of high curvature appearing nearby
the emerging singularity, which is essential from the perspective of quantum
gravity. We investigated several formulations of the theory for various values
of the Brans-Dicke coupling constant and the coupling between the Brans-Dicke
field and the matter sector of the theory. The obtained results indicated that
the evolving scalar fields can be treated as time variables in close proximity
of the singularity due to the following reasons. The constancy hypersurfaces of
the Brans-Dicke field are spacelike in the vicinity of the singularity apart
from the case, in which the equation of motion of the field reduces to the wave
equation due to a specific choice of free evolution parameters. The
hypersurfaces of constant complex and real scalar fields are spacelike in the
regions nearby the singularities formed during the examined process. The values
of the field functions change monotonically in the areas, in which the
constancy hypersurfaces are spacelike.

adopted a single dust-grain size of 0.1 micron, assumed to be representative of
the size distribution present in the interstellar medium. Here, we investigate
the effects of a broad grain-size distribution on the chemistry on dust-grain
surfaces and the subsequent build-up of molecular ices on the grains, using a
three-phase gas-grain chemical model of a quiescent dark cloud. We include an
explicit treatment of the grain temperatures, governed both by the visual
extinction of the cloud and the size of each individual grain-size population.
We find that the temperature difference plays a significant role in determining
the total bulk ice composition across the grain-size distribution, while the
effects of geometrical differences between size populations appear marginal. We
also consider collapse from a diffuse to a dark cloud, allowing dust
temperatures to fall. Under the initial diffuse conditions, small grains are
too warm to promote grain-mantle build-up, with most ices forming on the
mid-sized grains. As collapse proceeds, the more abundant, smallest grains cool
and become the dominant ice carriers; the large population of small grains
means that this ice is distributed across many grains, with perhaps no more
than 40 monolayers of ice each (versus several hundred assuming a single grain
size). This effect may be important for the subsequent processing and
desorption of the ice during the hot-core phase of star-formation, exposing a
significant proportion of the ice to the gas phase, increasing the importance
of ice-surface chemistry and surface-gas interactions.

studied in the off-resonant regime inhibiting single and many-particle first

wave-like propagation along of an optical lattice by means of an effective
Hamiltonian accounting for second order tunneling processes. It is shown that
dipole wavefunction evolution in the short-time limit is ballistic and that
finite size effects induce dynamical self-interference patterns known as
quantum carperts. We also present the effects of the border right after the
first reflection showing that the wavefunction diffuses normally with the

increasingly precise results for the fermion masses, given at low energies. To
perform such tests, the renormalization group (RG) running has to be performed
with sufficient accuracy. In supersymmetric (SUSY) theories, the one-loop
threshold corrections (TC) are of particular importance and, since they affect
the quark-lepton mass relations, link a given GUT flavour model to the
sparticle spectrum. To accurately study such predictions, we extend and
generalize various formulas in the literature which are needed for a precision
analysis of SUSY flavour GUT models. We introduce the new software tool SusyTC,
a major extension to the Mathematica package REAP, where these formulas are
implemented. SusyTC extends the functionality of REAP by a full inclusion of
the (complex) MSSM SUSY sector and a careful calculation of the one-loop SUSY
threshold corrections for the full down-type quark, up-type quark and charged
lepton Yukawa coupling matrices in the electroweak-unbroken phase. Among other
useful features, SusyTC calculates the one-loop corrected pole mass of the
charged (or the CP-odd) Higgs boson as well as provides output in SLHA
conventions, i.e. the necessary input for external software, e.g. for
performing a two-loop Higgs mass calculation. We apply SusyTC to study the
predictions for the parameters of the CMSSM (mSUGRA) SUSY scenario from the set

and the absence of any other signal of new physics at the LHC so far suggest
the existence of new colored scalars, which may be moderately light and thus
can induce sizable $X g g$ and $X \gamma \gamma$ couplings without resorting to
very strong interactions. Motivated by this speculation, we extend the
Manohar-Wise model by adding one gauge singlet scalar field. The resulting
theory then predicts one singlet dominated scalar $\phi$ as well as three kinds
of color-octet scalars, which can mediate through loops the $\phi gg$ and $\phi
\gamma \gamma$ interactions. After fitting the model to the diphoton data at
the LHC, we find that in reasonable parameter regions the excess can be
explained at $1\sigma$ level by the process $ g g \to \phi \to \gamma \gamma$,
and the best points predict the central value of the excess rate with
$\chi_{min}^2=2.32$, which corresponds to a $p$-value of $0.68$. We also
consider the constraints from various LHC Run I signals, and we conclude that,
although these constraints are powerful in excluding the parameter space of the

between a linear and non-linear dielectric media is covered by an embedded
mono-layer of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). The optical behaviour is
qualitatively obtained through transmission and reflection coefficients which
are a function of the third order non-linear susceptibility of the Kerr-type
dielectric and the inter-band optical conductivity of the TMDC mono-layer. The
inter-band optical conductivity of the TMCD mono-layer is calculated using the
Kubo formalism from linear response theory. In particular, we theoretically
demonstrate that the optical response of this arrangement can be switched
between total internal reflection and a normal transmission regime by
controlling the intensity of the incident radiation. The reflection and
transmission functions, additionally, are shown to be amenable to further
control by altering the inter-band optical conductivity of the embedded TMDC
mono-layer. The optical conductivity is an outcome of its energy dispersion; we
specifically choose two TMDC mono-layers, MoS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$, which have
nearly identical dispersion parameters apart from a much stronger spin-orbit
coupling in the latter. The stronger spin-orbit coupling in WSe$_{2}$ does not
significantly alter the inter-band optical conductivity to manifest in an
enhanced reflection spectrum. However, we find that application of an external

lightest right-handed neutrino ($N_1$) decay parameters helps the wash-out of a
pre-existing asymmetry and constraints relax compared to the non-supersymmetric

mixing angle can now be also maximal. The lightest (ordinary) neutrino mass is
still constrained within the range $10 \lesssim m_1/{\rm meV} \lesssim 30$

$N_2$-dominated scenario where the $N_1$ mass is lower than the sphaleron

$T_{\rm RH} \gtrsim 1\times 10^{9}\,{\rm GeV}$. These results indicate that

Majorana mass of order the Planck scale on the UV brane. Despite the
resemblance to a type I seesaw mechanism, a careful investigation based on the

the SM neutrino masses are generated dominantly by the exchange of the
TeV-scale mass eigenstates of the singlet, that are pseudo-Dirac and have a
sizable Higgs- induced mixing with the SM doublet neutrino: remarkably, in
warped 5D models the anticipated type I seesaw morphs into a natural
realization of the so-called ""inverse"" seesaw. This understanding uncovers an
intriguing and direct link between neutrino mass generation (and possibly
leptogenesis) and TeV-scale physics. We also perform estimates using the dual

interstellar absorbers, and thus reach a similar spatial perfection. Under
certain morphologies (e.g. geometrically thin absorption curtains) one can
infer a complete velocity vector from its radial velocity component and so
obtain a dynamical information comparable to stars. But observations of a large
number of stars at different distances are needed to determine the location of
the absorption pockets. Therefore, techniques to measure interstellar
absorptions towards (abundant) cool stars are needed.
  A complex mix of colliding absorption clouds is found in the Galactic plane.
Thus, one would wish to start with deep observations to detect the weak, but
simpler interstellar absorptions at high Galactic latitudes. Finally,
interstellar atomic line absorption studies toward cool stars in the optical
are largely limited to Sodium and Potassium doublets, not covered by many
surveys, including Gaia. Diffuse interstellar bands can give the same type of
information as interstellar atomic absorption lines. A combination of both may
also point to differences in dynamics of different components of the

absorption maps, as already demonstrated by RAVE. Additionally, several
ground-based surveys (e.g APOGEE, Gaia-ESO and Galah) are upgrading this

direction views linear lambda terms as complete invariants of their underlying
rooted trivalent maps, reconstructing the missing information through a
Tutte-style topological recurrence on maps with free edges. As an application

can be fulfilled at all. This requirement is met by materials showing a
sufficiently smooth elastic-plastic transition in the stress-strain curve. We
propose effective means to fulfil conditions (i) and (ii). We show in finite

wave detectors, which will start operating this year. The influence of spin on

action principle of spinning point-particles. These spinning point-particles
serve as an analytic model for extended bodies. The internal structure can be
modelled by augmenting the point-particle with higher-order multipole moments.

broad range of physics aspects in the field of the hadron structure and
spectroscopy. One of the important objectives of the COMPASS experiment is the
exploration of transverse spin structure of the nucleon via study of spin
(in)dependent azimuthal asymmetries with semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering (SIDIS) processes and starting from 2014 also with Drell-Yan (DY)
reactions. Experimental results obtained by COMPASS for azimuthal effects in
SIDIS play an important role in the general understanding of the
three-dimensional nature of the nucleon. Giving access to the entire ""twist-2""
set of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs)
and fragmentation functions (FFs) COMPASS data trigger constant theoretical
interest and are being widely used in phenomenological analyses and global data
fits. In particular, unique x-$Q^{2}$-z-pT multidimensional results for
transverse spin asymmetries recently obtained by COMPASS will serve as a direct
and unprecedented input for TMD $Q^{2}$-evolution related studies, one of the
hottest topics in the field of spin-physics. In addition, measurement of the
Sivers and all other azimuthal effects in polarized Drell-Yan at COMPASS will
reveal another side of the spin-puzzle providing a link between SIDIS and
Drell-Yan branches. This will be a unique possibility to test universality and
key-features of TMD PDFs using essentially the same experimental setup and
exploring the same kinematical domain. In this review main focus will be given

the direction transverse to the Standard Model 7-branes. Integrating out heavy
3-7 string messenger states leads to dimension five operators for gluon fusion

between the locality $k$ and the local Hilbert space dimension $d$. For
geometrically 2-local (i.e., $k=2$), it is known that $d=8$ is already

the minimum required $d$ should decrease. We provide a construction of

where the main neutron source is the $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction.
This last is activated from locally-produced $^{13}$C, formed by partial mixing
of hydrogen into the He-rich layers. We present here the first attempt at
describing a physical mechanism for the formation of the $^{13}$C reservoir,
studying the mass circulation induced by magnetic buoyancy and without adding
new free parameters to those already involved in stellar modelling. Our
approach represents the application, to the stellar layers relevant for
$s$-processing, of recent exact, analytical 2D and 3D models for
magneto-hydrodynamic processes at the base of convective envelopes in evolved
stars in order to promote downflows of envelope material for mass conservation,
during the occurrence of a dredge-up phenomenon. We find that the proton
penetration is characterized by small concentrations, but extended over a large
fractional mass of the He-layers, thus producing $^{13}$C reservoirs of several
$10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The ensuing $^{13}$C-enriched zone has an almost flat
profile, while only a limited production of $^{14}$N occurs. In order to verify
the effects of our new findings we show how the abundances of the main

the many interrelations between modular graph functions (a few of which were

parameter space in this scenario using the results from LHC Run 1, DM relic
density, and DM direct and indirect detection experiments. We find that the DM
searches can exclude a large portion of the parameter regions accounting for
the diphoton excess with a broad width.

abstract properties of large scale computer software and hardware purely in
terms of ordinary deterministic state machines. The goal is to be able to work
with specifications ranging from operating systems to databases and real-time
control. State machines with output are represented as maps from finite
sequences of events to outputs so that f(s) is the output in the state reached
by following s from a initial state. Composite sequence maps correspond to
state machine products. The methods used here can specify or constrain both
system behavior and system design. Motivating examples presented range from
simple counters to distributed consensus algorithms and real-time circuits. The
approach is intended to facilitate ""back of the envelope"" descriptions of
devices and software and also to allow for detailed hierarchical specifications
of behavior and architecture.
  The mathematical approach is based on both primitive recursion on sequences
\cite{PeterComputer} and automata products with feedback \cite{Gecseg}, adapted
to Moore type state machines. No formal methods or other metamathematical
techniques are employed and although parallel and concurrent composite systems
are easy to specify, it is not necessary to make any particular communication
scheme primitive. State machines are not augmented or extended - even the most
complex composite systems are modeled by ordinary deterministic state machines
which have a rich mathematical theory related to semigroups.

it captures model uncertainty arising from lack of evidence or from interacting

To model scattering effects, a new approach was applied based on propagation in

calculations providing more binding than the two hole-line contribution for the
same interaction was overcome by calculations including three hole-line
contributions without however reproducing the empirical nuclear saturation
properties. It is argued that this remaining problem is still open because many
solutions have been proposed or ad hoc adjustments implemented without
generating universal agreement on the proper interpretation of the physics. The
problem of nuclear saturation therefore persists leading to the necessity of an
analysis of the way the nuclear saturation properties are obtained from
experimental data. We clarify the role of short-range correlations and review
results for nuclear saturation when such ingredients are completely taken into
account using the Green's function method. The role of long-range correlations
is then analyzed with special emphasis on the importance of attractive
pion-dominated excitation modes which inevitably lead to higher saturation
densities than observed. Because such modes have no counterpart in finite
nuclear systems, it is therefore argued that they should not be considered when
calculating nuclear matter properties. The remaining open question is then
whether long-range correlations in finite nuclei which in turn have no
counterpart in infinite matter, represent the remaining missing ingredient in
this analysis.

set is a requirement that a function parametrized by the decision variables is

semidefinite program is challenging if the polynomials involved are of high
degree, due to numerical difficulties and bad scaling arising both from the
polynomial approximations and from the fact that the semidefinite programming

techniques and polynomial programming to overcome these numerical difficulties,

Scalar states at mass scales above the electroweak scale decaying significantly
into photon final states generically lead to modifications of Standard Model
Higgs phenomenology. We characterise this effect using the formalism of
Effective Field Theory (EFT) and study the modification of the effective
couplings to photons and gluons of the Higgs. The modification of Higgs
phenomenology comes about in a variety of ways. For scalar $0^+$states, the
Higgs and the heavy boson can mix. Lower energy phenomenology gives a limit on
the mixing angle, which gets generated at one loop in any such theory
explaining the diphoton excess. Even if the mixing angle is set to zero, we
demonstrate that a relation exists between lower energy Higgs data and a
massive scaler decaying to diphoton final states. If the new boson is a
pseudoscalar, we note that if it is composite, it is generic to have an excited
scalar partner that can mix with the Higgs, which has a stronger coupling to
photons. In the case of a pseudoscalar, we also characterize how lower energy
Higgs phenomenology is directly modified using EFT, even without assuming a
scalar partner of the pseudoscalar state. We find that naturalness concerns can
be accommodated, and that pseudoscalar models are more protected from lower
energy constraints.

systematically derive analytic models for nonrotating cores of different

large-distance topology. We explain how the conservation law provides a
stabilizing mechanism when the coreless vortex imprinted on the condensate
relaxes in the polar regime of interatomic interactions. The resulting
structure forms a composite defect: the inner ferromagnetic coreless vortex
deforms toward an outer singly quantized polar vortex. We also numerically show
how other even more complex hierarchies of vortex core topologies may be
stabilized. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the coreless vortex also in a
ferromagnetic condensate, and show how reducing magnetization leads to a
displacement of the vortex from the trap center and eventually to the
deformation and splitting of its core where a singular vortex becomes a
lower-energy state. For the case of singular vortices, we find that the

liquid compound ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 (Herbertsmithite) reveals antiferromagnetic
correlations between impurity spins for energy transfers E < 0.8 meV (~J/20).
The momentum dependence differs significantly from higher energy scattering
which arises from the intrinsic kagome spins. The low energy fluctuations are
characterized by diffuse scattering near wavevectors (1 0 0) and (0 0 3/2),
which is consistent with antiferromagnetic correlations between pairs of
nearest neighbor Cu impurities on adjacent triangular (Zn) interlayers. The
corresponding impurity lattice resembles a simple cubic lattice in the dilute
limit below the percolation threshold. Such an impurity model can describe
prior neutron, NMR, and specific heat data. The low energy neutron data are
consistent with the presence of a small spin-gap (Delta ~ 0.7 meV) in the
kagome layers, similar to that recently observed by NMR. The ability to
distinguish the scattering due to Cu impurities from that of the planar kagome
Cu spins provides a new avenue for probing intrinsic spin liquid physics.

show how machine learning tools facilitate identification of subtypes of SNeIa

space of spectral diversity formed by these objects. Using Deep Learning, we
were capable of performing such identification in a 4 dimensional feature space

achieves similar results using 15 principal components. This is evidence that
the progenitor system and the explosion mechanism can be described by a small
number of initial physical parameters. As a proof of concept, we show that our
results are in close agreement with a previously suggested classification
scheme and that our proposed method can grasp the main spectral features behind
the definition of such subtypes. This allows the confirmation of the velocity
of lines as a first order effect in the determination of SNIa subtypes,
followed by 91bg-like events. Given the expected data deluge in the forthcoming

provides a unified description of both elastic nucleon scattering and structure

elastic differential cross sections for ${}^{40}$Ca as compared to local ones

consequences for the analysis of nuclear reactions. Below the Fermi energy,
nonlocality is essential for an accurate representation of particle number and
the nuclear charge density. Spectral properties implied by $(e,e'p)$ and
$(p,2p)$ reactions are correctly described, including the energy distribution
of about 10\% high-momentum protons obtained at Jefferson Lab. The nonlocal DOM
allows a complete description of experimental data both above (up to 200 MeV)

elastic nucleon-nucleus scattering data constrain the spectral strength in the
continuum of orbits that are nominally bound in the independent-particle model.

Galactic center has been proposed to host a large population of as-yet
undetected millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recently, this hypothesis found support
in the analysis of gamma rays from the inner Galaxy seen by the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi satellite, which revealed a possible excess of
diffuse GeV photons in the inner 15 deg about the Galactic center (Fermi GeV
excess). The excess can be interpreted as the collective emission of thousands
of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, with a spherical distribution that strongly
peaks towards the Galactic center. In order to fully establish the MSP
interpretation, it is essential to find corroborating evidence in
multi-wavelength searches, most notably through the detection of radio
pulsation from individual bulge MSPs. Based on globular cluster observations
and the gamma-ray emission from the inner Galaxy, we investigate the prospects
for detecting MSPs in the Galactic bulge. While previous pulsar surveys failed
to identify this population, we demonstrate that, in the upcoming years, new
large-area surveys with focus on regions a few degrees north or south of the
Galactic center should lead to the detection of dozens of bulge MSPs.
Additionally, we show that, in the near future, deep targeted searches of
unassociated Fermi sources should be able to detect the first few MSPs in the
bulge. The prospects for these deep searches are enhanced by a tentative
gamma-ray/radio correlation that we infer from high-latitude gamma-ray MSPs.
Such detections would constitute the first clear discoveries of field MSPs in
the Galactic bulge, with far-reaching implications for gamma-ray observations,
the formation history of the central Milky Way and strategy optimization for
future radio observations.

composite pseudoscalars, bound states of heavy fermions under a new confining

particles are electrically charged. The decays of these pion-like bound states
into two photons can explain the observed events near 750 GeV. The model
predicts that there should be significant numbers of 4-photon events from
decays of the pseudoscalar pairs, as well as same-sign dilepton pairs at a
somewhat lower invariant mass, or multijet signals, coming from decays of
charge-2 pseudoscalars. These states and their decays are necessary for

explained, along with several anomalies seen in the flavor sector, in models
where a Standard-Model singlet scalar resonance with mass $M \approx 750$ GeV
is produced in gluon fusion via loops containing a scalar color- triplet
leptoquark $\phi$. For a leptoquark mass $M_\phi \lesssim$ 1 TeV, the
production cross section is naturally in the 10 fb range. A large $S \to \gamma
\gamma$ branching ratio can be obtained by coupling the scalar S to new
color-singlet fermions $\chi$ with electroweak scale masses, which can be part
of an $SU(2)_L$ multiplet, whose neutral component has the right mass and
quantum numbers to be a dark matter candidate. Our model reveals a connection
between flavor anomalies, the nature of dark matter and a new scalar, which
acts as a mediator to the dark sector. The loop-mediated decay $S \to
\tau^+\tau^-$ could be a striking signature of this model.

technique for the detection of very low frequency sources of gravitational
waves. In any single pulsar, a stochastic gravitational wave signal appears as
an additional source of timing noise that can be absorbed by the noise model,
and so it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of
pulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In
the limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many
pulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern
that depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is
this distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using
pulsar timing arrays. Here we consider how the prospects for detection are
diminished when the statistical isotropy of the timing array or the
gravitational wave signal is broken by having a finite number of pulsars and a
finite number of sources. We find the standard tensor-correlation analysis to
be remarkably robust, with a mild impact on detectability compared to the
isotropic limit. Only when there are very few sources and very few pulsars does
the standard analysis begin to fail. Having established that the tensor
correlations are a robust signature for detection, we study the use of
""sky-scrambles"" to break the correlations as a way to increase confidence in a
detection. This approach is analogous to the use of ""time-slides"" in the
analysis of data from ground based interferometric detectors.

characterizing brain states than local analysis of the connectivity of brain

the brain. However, conventional graph theoretical analyses are limited due to
the lack of formal statistical methods for estimation and inference for random
graphs. For example, the concept of correlation between two vectors of graphs
is yet not defined. The aim of this article to introduce a notion of
correlation between graphs. In order to develop a framework to infer
correlation between graphs, we assume that they are generated by mathematical
models and that the parameters of the models are our random variables. Then, we
define that two vectors of graphs are independent whether their parameters are
independent. The problem is that, in real world, the model is rarely known, and
consequently, the parameters cannot be estimated. By analyzing the graph
spectrum, we showed that the spectral radius is highly associated with the
parameters of the graph model. Based on it, we constructed a framework for
correlation inference between graphs and illustrate our approach in a
functional magnetic resonance imaging data composed of 814 subjects comprising
529 controls and 285 individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Results show that correlations between default-mode and control, default-mode

require accurate knowledge of the instrument orientation relative to the sky

calibration sources that could be used to measure the polarimeter orientation
angle are limited, so current experiments commonly `self-calibrate.' The
self-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $EB$ and $TB$
cross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model, so any
detected $EB$ and $TB$ signals must be due to systematic errors. However, this
assumption neglects the fact that polarized Galactic foregrounds in a given
portion of the sky may have non-zero $EB$ and $TB$ cross-spectra. If these
foreground signals remain in the observations, then they will bias the
self-calibrated telescope polarisation angle and produce a spurious $B$-mode
signal. In this paper we estimate the foreground-induced bias for various
instrument configurations and then expand the self-calibration formalism to
account for polarized foreground signals. Assuming the $EB$ correlation signal
for dust is in the range constrained by angular power spectrum measurements
from Planck at 353 GHz (scaled down to 150 GHz), then the bias is negligible
for high angular resolution experiments, which have access to CMB-dominated
high $\ell$ modes with which to self-calibrate. Low-resolution experiments
observing particularly dusty sky patches can have a bias as large as
$0.5^\circ$. A miscalibration of this magnitude generates a spurious $BB$

symmetric, which requires an extension of the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory of
the compressible state observed at this filling. Recent work indicates that,
when particle-hole symmetry is preserved, the composite Fermions experience a
quantized $\pi$-Berry phase upon winding around the composite Fermi-surface,
analogous to Dirac fermions at the surface of a 3D topological insulator. In
contrast, the effective low energy theory of the composite fermion liquid
originally proposed by HLR lacks particle-hole symmetry and has vanishing Berry
phase. In this paper, we explain how thermoelectric transport measurements can
be used to test the Dirac nature of the composite Fermions by quantitatively
extracting this Berry phase. First we point out that longitudinal thermopower
(Seebeck effect) is non-vanishing due to the unusual nature of particle hole
symmetry in this context and is not sensitive to the Berry phase. In contrast,
we find that off-diagonal thermopower (Nernst effect) is directly related to
the topological structure of the composite Fermi surface, vanishing for zero
Berry phase and taking its maximal value for $\pi$ Berry phase. In contrast, in
purely electrical transport signatures the Berry phase contributions appear as
small corrections to a large background signal, making the Nernst effect a
promising diagnostic of the Dirac nature of composite fermions.

HII regions. A possible explanations for these arcs is that they could show the
outer edges of asymmetric stellar wind bubbles. We use two-dimensional,
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within HII regions around
individual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust within
the HII region. We assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled and
that dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the HII
region as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. We
post-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared
wavebands using the TORUS code. We find that the outer edge of a wind bubble
emits brightly at 24um through starlight absorbed by dust grains and
re-radiated thermally in the infrared. This produces a bright arc of emission
for slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where
there is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.
The 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing
distance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.
The size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but
not qualitative effects on our results. Despite the simplifications of our
model, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the HII region
RCW120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences.
Our model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arc
around CD -38 11636 in RCW120, and with comparable brightness. This suggests
that infrared arcs around O stars in HII regions may be revealing the extent of
stellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations.

overdensities on the scales of $\sim$ 10 - 20 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc. On such

CoSLAs can be confused with high column density absorbers. For $z>2.6$, where
the corresponding Ly$\beta$ is redshifted to the optical, we have developed the

intergalactic absorption groups using multiple sight lines. Our overdensity
searches fully utilize the current and next generation of Ly$\alpha$ forest
surveys which cover a survey volume of $> (1\ h^{-1}$ Gpc)$^3$. In addition,
systems traced by CoSLAs will build a uniform sample of the most massive

null congruence of flat spacetime characterizing the Kerr solution. A
straightforward advantage of this strategy is that now the parameter $a$

into account the circularity theorem. In fact, a stationary-axisymmetric
Kerr-Schild ansatz is in general incompatible with the circularity property
warranted by vacuum Einstein equations unless the remaining angular dependence
in the Kerr-Schild profile appears fixed in a precise way. Thanks to these two
ingredients, the integration of the Einstein equations reduces to a simple
ordinary differential equation on the radial dependence, whose integration
constant is precisely the mass $m$. This derivation of the Kerr solution is
simple but rigorous, and it may be suitable for any textbook.

depth. The variable seeing conditions, sky background and transparency of
ground-based observations make the coaddition process non-trivial. We present
image coaddition methods optimized for source detection and flux measurement,
that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). We show that for these purposes
the best way to combine images is to apply a matched filter to each image using
its own point spread function (PSF) and only then to sum the images with the
appropriate weights. Methods that either match filter after coaddition, or
perform PSF homogenization prior to coaddition will result in loss of
sensitivity. We argue that our method provides an increase of between a few and
25 percent in the survey speed of deep ground-based imaging surveys compared
with weighted coaddition techniques. We demonstrate this claim using simulated
data as well as data from the Palomar Transient Factory data release 2. We
present a variant of this coaddition method which is optimal for PSF or
aperture photometry. We also provide an analytic formula for calculating the
S/N for PSF photometry on single or multiple observations. In the next paper in
this series we present a method for image coaddition in the limit of
background-dominated noise which is optimal for any statistical test or
measurement on the constant-in-time image (e.g., source detection, shape or

redundant. We provide an implementation of this algorithm in MATLAB.

or wide gaps (with widths comparable to their radii) in their dust component.
These discs could be giving us clues about the disc destruction mechanism or
hints about the location and time-scales for the formation of planets. However,
at the moment there remain key gaps in our theoretical understanding. The vast
majority of transition discs are accreting onto their central stars, indicating
that - at least close to the star - dust has been depleted from the gas by a
very large amount. In this review, we discuss evidence for two distinct
populations of transition discs: mm-faint - those with low mm-fluxes, small
holes ($\lesssim$10AU) and low accretion rates (~1e-10-1e-9 Msun/yr) and
mm-bright - discs with large mm-fluxes, large holes ($\gtrsim$20 AU) and high
accretion rates ~1e-8 Msun/yr. MM-faint transition discs are consistent with
what would naively be expected from a disc undergoing dispersal; however,
mm-bright discs are not, and are likely to be rare and long-lived objects. We
discuss the two commonly proposed mechanisms for creating transition discs:
photoevaporation and planet-disc interactions, with a particular emphasis on
how they would evolve in these models, comparing these predictions to the
observed population. More theoretical work on explaining the lack of optically
thick, non-accreting transition discs is required in both the photoevaporation
and planetary hypothesis, before we can start to use transition discs to
constrain models of planet formation. Finally, we suggest that the few discs
with primordial looking SEDs, but serendipitously imaged, showing large
cavities in the mm (e.g. MWC758 & WSB 60) may represent a hidden population of
associated objects. Characterising and understanding how these objects fit into
the overall paradigm may allow us to unravel the mystery of transition discs.

anomalous quantum reflection of incident wave packets acting solely on bosonic

single-occupancy components can pass the barrier thus allowing one to distill
them in the central interacting zone. As a consequence, in this region one
finds a state in which the multiple occupancy is forbidden, i.e., a

perform. In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to
detect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that
the noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive
from first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any
hypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape
measurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated
case. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting
coadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from
the original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis
testing or measurement that can be done on all the individual images
simultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of
information. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the
PSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically
indistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that
measures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it
unchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in
paper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This
coaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the
maximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the
image, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of
equal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch
seeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and
diffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations. The last topic will be
covered in depth in future papers. We provide an implementation of this

captured by geo-located tweets were found to follow similar patterns, where a
few geographic locations dominate the tweeting activity of individual users.
However, little is known about the semantics (landuse types) and temporal
tweeting behavior at those frequently-visited locations. Furthermore, it is
generally assumed that the top two visited locations for most of the users are
home and work locales (Hypothesis A) and people tend to tweet at their top
locations during a particular time of the day (Hypothesis B). In this paper, we
tested these two frequently cited hypotheses by examining the tweeting patterns
of more than 164,000 unique Twitter users whom were residents of the city of
Chicago during 2014. We extracted landuse attributes for each geo-located tweet
from the detailed inventory of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.
Top-visited locations were identified by clustering semantic enriched tweets
using a DBSCAN algorithm. Our results showed that although the top two
locations are likely to be residential and occupational/educational, a portion
of the users deviated from this case, suggesting that the first hypothesis
oversimplify real-world situations. However, our observations indicated that
people tweet at specific times and these temporal signatures are dependent on
landuse types. We further discuss the implication of confounding variables,
such as clustering algorithm parameters and relative accuracy of tweet
coordinates, which are critical factors in any experimental design involving
Twitter data.

diseases are commonly based on the predictions of ordinary differential
equation (ODE) systems or Markov models (MMs). Standard MMs are static, whereas
ODE systems are usually dynamic and account for herd immunity which is crucial
to prevent overestimation of infection prevalence. Complex ODE systems
including probabilistic model parameters are computationally intensive. Thus,
mainly ODE-based models including deterministic parameters are presented in the
literature. These do not account for parameter uncertainty. As a consequence,
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), a crucial component of health
economic evaluations, cannot be conducted straightforwardly.
  Methods. We present a dynamic MM under a Bayesian framework. We extend a
static MM by incorporating the force of infection into the state allocation
algorithm. The corresponding output is based on dynamic changes in prevalence
and thus accounts for herd immunity. In contrast to deterministic ODE-based
models, PSA can be conducted straightforwardly. We introduce a case study of a
fictional sexually transmitted infection and compare our dynamic Bayesian MM to
a deterministic and a Bayesian ODE system. The models are calibrated to time
series data.
  Results. By means of the case study, we show that our methodology produces
outcome which is comparable to the ""gold standard"" of the Bayesian ODE system.
  Conclusions. In contrast to ODE systems in the literature, the setting of the
dynamic MM is probabilistic at manageable computational effort (including
calibration). The run time of the Bayesian ODE system is 44 times longer.

non-strongly concave quadratic maximization problem without constraints. In
each iteration of SDA, a dual variable is updated by a carefully chosen point
in a subspace spanned by the columns of a random matrix drawn independently
from a fixed distribution. The distribution plays the role of a parameter of
the method. Our complexity results hold for a wide family of distributions of
random matrices, which opens the possibility to fine-tune the stochasticity of
the method to particular applications. We prove that primal iterates associated
with the dual process converge to the projection exponentially fast in
expectation, and give a formula and an insightful lower bound for the
convergence rate. We also prove that the same rate applies to dual function
values, primal function values and the duality gap. Unlike traditional
iterative methods, SDA converges under no additional assumptions on the system
(e.g., rank, diagonal dominance) beyond consistency. In fact, our lower bound
improves as the rank of the system matrix drops. Many existing randomized
methods for linear systems arise as special cases of SDA, including randomized
Kaczmarz, randomized Newton, randomized coordinate descent, Gaussian descent,
and their variants. In special cases where our method specializes to a known
algorithm, we either recover the best known rates, or improve upon them.
Finally, we show that the framework can be applied to the distributed average

to model large-scale semantic knowledge graphs. A key concept is a mapping of
the knowledge graph to a tensor representation whose entries are predicted by
models using latent representations of generalized entities. Knowledge graphs
are typically treated as static: A knowledge graph grows more links when more
facts become available but the ground truth values associated with links is
considered time invariant. In this paper we address the issue of knowledge
graphs where triple states depend on time. We assume that changes in the
knowledge graph always arrive in form of events, in the sense that the events
are the gateway to the knowledge graph. We train an event prediction model
which uses both knowledge graph background information and information on
recent events. By predicting future events, we also predict likely changes in
the knowledge graph and thus obtain a model for the evolution of the knowledge
graph as well. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach performs well in a
clinical application, a recommendation engine and a sensor network application.

solve for complex-valued perturbations around a nominal voltage profile from a

the voltage profile where the real part of the perturbation is suppressed

This result motivates the development of approximate solutions that improve
over conventional DC power-flow approximations, since the model includes ZIP

important to know whether the query is stable, that is, whether the answers

add further data. We investigate query stability for conjunctive queries. To
this end, we define a formalism that combines an explicit representation of the
control flow of a process with a specification of how data is read and inserted
into the database. We consider different restrictions of the process model and
the state of the system, such as negation in conditions, cyclic executions,
read access to written data, presence of pending process instances, and the
possibility to start fresh process instances. We identify for which facet
combinations stability of conjunctive queries is decidable and provide
encodings into variants of Datalog that are optimal with respect to the
worst-case complexity of the problem.

understanding of physics of neutrino oscillations in matter. Moreover, quite
recently, we have shown that our three-flavor oscillation probabilities
P(\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta) in all channels can be expressed in the
form of universal functions of L/E. The \nu_e disappearance oscillation

The trajectory is optimized by minimizing a quadratic objective function in an

on employing sophisticated optimization strategies, or seeking more effective
models. Residual quantization (RQ) is such an alternative that holds the same
property as PQ in terms of the aforementioned complexities. In addition to
being a direct replacement of PQ, hybrids of PQ and RQ can yield more gains for
approximate nearest neighbor search. This motivated us to propose a novel

the general randomness increase in a residual space, we propose a new strategy

with the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation at low Reynolds numbers, which
takes into account the increase of the drag force on each particle due to
wall-particle hydrodynamic forces. We find that the ratio of the short-time
diffusion coefficients of the monomer and that of the center of mass of the

term rewriting, CSR is the restriction of rewriting that arises when reductions

Transport observables, such as conductance and shot-noise power are just

transmission eigenvalues, which in turn can be obtained from a finite element
representation of the saddle-point equation of the Keldysh (or supersymmetric)
non-linear sigma-model, known as quantum circuit theory. Normal universal
metallic behavior in the semiclassical regime is controlled by the presence of
a Fabry-Perot singularity in the average density of transmission eigenvalues.
We present general conditions for the suppression of Fabry-Perot modes in the
semiclassical regime in a sample of arbitrary shape, a disordered conductor or
a network of ballistic quantum dots, which leads to an anomalous metallic
phase. Through a double-scaling limit, we derive a scaling equation for
anomalous metallic transport, in the form of a nonlinear differential equation,
which generalizes the ballistic-diffusive scaling equation of a normal metal.
The two-parameter stationary solution of our scaling equation generalizes
Dorokhov's universal single-parameter distribution of transmission eigenvalues.
We provide a simple interpretation of the stationary solution using a
thermodynamic analogy with a spin-glass system. As an application, we consider
a system formed by a diffusive wire coupled via a barrier to
normal-superconductor (NS) reservoirs. We observe anomalous reflectionless
tunneling, when all perfectly transmitting channels are suppressed, which
cannot be explained by the usual mechanism of disorder-induced opening of

the short lifetime of small systems. In this regime, pre-equilibrium dynamics

for assessing cilia performance and robustness when subject to perturbations in
the cilia apparatus. Here, we link cilia design (beating patterns) to function
(flow transport) in the context of experimentally- and theoretically-derived
cilia models. We particularly examine the optimality and robustness of cilia
design. Optimality refers to efficiency of flow transport, while robustness is
defined as low sensitivity to variations in the design parameters. We find that
suboptimal designs can be more robust than optimal ones. That is, designing for
the most efficient cilium does not guarantee robustness. These findings have
significant implications on the understanding of cilia design in artificial and

Group (IM-SRG), a novel ab inito method for nuclei. The IM-SRG employs a
continuous unitary transformation of the many-body Hamiltonian to decouple the
ground state from all excitations, thereby solving the many-body problem.
Starting from a pedagogical introduction of the underlying concepts, the IM-SRG
flow equations are developed for systems with and without explicit spherical
symmetry. We study different IM-SRG generators that achieve the desired
decoupling, and how they affect the details of the IM-SRG flow. Based on
calculations of closed-shell nuclei, we assess possible truncations for closing
the system of flow equations in practical applications, as well as choices of
the reference state. We discuss the issue of center-of-mass factorization and
demonstrate that the IM-SRG ground-state wave function exhibits an approximate
decoupling of intrinsic and center-of-mass degrees of freedom, similar to
Coupled Cluster (CC) wave functions. To put the IM-SRG in context with other
many-body methods, in particular many-body perturbation theory and
non-perturbative approaches like CC, a detailed perturbative analysis of the
IM-SRG flow equations is carried out. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing
developments, including IM-SRG calculations with three-nucleon forces, the
multi-reference IM-SRG for open-shell nuclei, first non-perturbative
derivations of shell- model interactions, and the consistent evolution of

density fluctuation caused by turbulence effectively increases the relative

We investigate the onset of runaway growth in a turbulent disk through
simulations that calculate the mass and velocity evolution of planetesimals.
When planetesimals are small, the average relative velocity between
planetesimals, $v_{\rm r}$, is much greater than their surface escape velocity,
$v_{\rm esc}$, so that runaway growth does not occur. As planetesimals become
large via collisional growth, $v_{\rm r}$ approaches $v_{\rm esc}$. When
$v_{\rm r} \approx 1.5 v_{\rm esc}$, runaway growth of the planetesimals
occurs. During the oligarchic growth subsequent to runaway growth, a small
number of planetary embryos produced via runaway growth become massive through
collisions with planetesimals with radii of that at the onset of runaway
growth, $r_{\rm p,run}$. We analytically derive $r_{\rm p,run}$ as a function
of the turbulent strength. Growing $\sim 10\,M_\oplus$ embryos that are
suitable to become the cores of Jupiter and Saturn requires $r_{\rm p,run} \sim
100$\,km, which is similar to the proposed fossil feature in the size
distribution of main belt asteroids. In contrast, the formation of Mars as
quickly as suggested from Hf-W isotope studies requires small planetesimals at
the onset of runaway growth. Thus, the conditions required to form Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn and the size distribution of the main-belt asteroids
indicate that the turbulence increased in amplitude relative to the sound speed

investigating gas kinematics and cloud column density distributions as a
function of galaxy color, redshift, and projected distance from the galaxy

at $0.3<z_{\rm gal}<1.0$, we have detected MgII absorption in high-resolution
($\Delta v\simeq 6.6$ km/s) spectra of background quasars within a projected
distance of $7<D<190$ kpc. We characterize the absorption velocity spread using
pixel-velocity two-point correlation functions. Velocity dispersions and cloud
column densities for blue galaxies do not differ with redshift nor with
$D/R_{\rm vir}$. This suggests that outflows continually replenish the CGM of
blue galaxies with high velocity dispersion, large column density gas out to
large distances. Conversely, absorption hosted by red galaxies evolves with
redshift where the velocity dispersions (column densities) are smaller (larger)
at $z_{\rm gal}<0.656$. After taking into account larger possible velocities in
more massive galaxies, we find that there is no difference in the velocity
dispersions or column densities for absorption hosted by red galaxies with
$D/R_{\rm vir}$. Thus, a lack of outflows in red galaxies causes the CGM to
become more quiescent over time, with lower velocity dispersions and larger
column densities towards lower $z_{\rm gal}$. The quenching of star formation
appears to affect the CGM out to $D/R_{\rm vir}=0.75$.

they apply their own subjective judgments on what to ignore and what to
mention. We refer to these noisy ""human-centric"" annotations as exhibiting
human reporting bias. Examples of such annotations include image tags and
keywords found on photo sharing sites, or in datasets containing image
captions. In this paper, we use these noisy annotations for learning visually
correct image classifiers. Such annotations do not use consistent vocabulary,
and miss a significant amount of the information present in an image; however,
we demonstrate that the noise in these annotations exhibits structure and can
be modeled. We propose an algorithm to decouple the human reporting bias from
the correct visually grounded labels. Our results are highly interpretable for
reporting ""what's in the image"" versus ""what's worth saying."" We demonstrate
the algorithm's efficacy along a variety of metrics and datasets, including MS
COCO and Yahoo Flickr 100M. We show significant improvements over traditional
algorithms for both image classification and image captioning, doubling the
performance of existing methods in some cases.

reconnection is also thought to be a key process involved in shedding
internally produced plasma from the giant magnetospheres at Jupiter and Saturn
through topological reconfiguration of the magnetic field. The region where
magnetic fields reconnect is known as the diffusion region and in this letter
we report on the first encounter of the Cassini spacecraft with a diffusion
region in Saturn's magnetotail. The data also show evidence of magnetic
reconnection over a period of 19 h revealing that reconnection can, in fact,
act for prolonged intervals in a rapidly rotating magnetosphere. We show that
reconnection can be a significant pathway for internal plasma loss at Saturn.
This counters the view of reconnection as a transient method of internal plasma
loss at Saturn. These results, although directly relating to the magnetosphere
of Saturn, have applications in the understanding of other rapidly rotating

industrial processes. Despite extensive advances in this field of research, our
understanding and the ability to control droplet dynamics at high temperature
remain limited, in part due to the emergence of complex wetting states
intertwined by the phase change process at the triple-phase interfaces. Here we
show that two concurrent wetting states (Leidenfrost and contact boiling) can
be manifested in a single droplet above its boiling point rectified by the
presence of asymmetric textures. The breaking of the wetting symmetry at high
temperature subsequently leads to the preferential motion towards the region
with higher heat transfer coefficient. We demonstrate experimentally and
analytically that the droplet vectoring is intricately dependent on the
interplay between the structural topography and its imposed thermal state. Our
fundamental understanding and the ability to control the droplet dynamics at
high temperature represent an important advance and enable the rational design
of various surfaces for multifunctional applications, especially in high
temperature thermal systems where high energy efficiency, security and

identities are used for tackling two of the fundamental difficulties that
areinherent to deterministic distributed computing, namely: (1) symmetry
breaking, and (2) topological information gathering. In the context of local
computation, i.e., when nodes can gather information only from nodes at bounded
distances, some insight regarding the role of identities has been established.
For instance, it was shown that, for large classes of construction problems,
the role of the identities can be rather small. However, for theidentities to
play no role, some other kinds of mechanisms for breaking symmetry must be
employed, such as edge-labeling or sense of direction. When it comes to local
distributed decision problems, the specification of the decision task does not
seem to involve symmetry breaking. Therefore, it is expected that, assuming
nodes can gather sufficient information about their neighborhood, one could get
rid of the identities, without employing extra mechanisms for breaking
symmetry. We tackle this question in the framework of the $\local$ model. Let
$\LD$ be the class of all problems that can be decided in a constant number of
rounds in the $\local$ model. Similarly, let $\LD^*$ be the class of all
problems that can be decided at constant cost in the anonymous variant of the
$\local$ model, in which nodes have no identities, but each node can get access
to the (anonymous) ball of radius $t$ around it, for any $t$, at a cost of $t$.
It is clear that $\LD^*\subseteq \LD$. We conjecture that $\LD^*=\LD$. In this
paper, we give several evidences supporting this conjecture. In particular, we
show that it holds for hereditary problems, as well as when the nodes know an
arbitrary upper bound on the total number of nodes. Moreover, we prove that the
conjecture holds in the context of non-deterministic local decision, where
nodes are given certificates (independent of the identities, if they exist),
and the decision consists in verifying these certificates. In short, we prove
that $\NLD^*=\NLD$.

April 2008, respectively. For the 25 March event, an M 1.7 class flare, a
filament eruption, and hard X-ray (HXR) and soft X-ray (SXR) emissions were
observed during the CME onset. The observed CME kinematics and SXR light curve
of this event are found to be more consistent with the EF model than with the
CA model. For the 5 April event, the SXR light curve shows multiple
enhancements, some of which temporally coincide with successive side loop
brightening and multiple foot points at the source region after the eruption.
The physical connection between the side-loop multiple brightenings and the
eruption cannot be determined from the data. Both models produced
observationally consistent kinematics profiles, and the EF model correctly
predicted the first emission enhancement. Neither model includes multiple
brightenings in the formulation.

onto the usual complex plane by using stereographic projection. In this paper,
after reviewing the entanglement of two-qubit pure state, it is shown that the
\emph{quaternionic} stereographic projection is related to concurrence measure.
This is due to the fact that every two-qubit state, in ordinary complex field,
corresponds to the one-qubit state in quaternionic skew field, called
quaterbit. Like the one-qubit states in complex field, the stereographic
projection maps every quaterbit onto a quaternion number whose complex and
quaternionic parts are related to Schmidt and concurrence terms respectively.
Rather, the same relation is established for three-qubit state under
\emph{octonionic} stereographic projection which means that if the state is
bi-separable then, quaternionic and octonionic terms vanish. Finally, we
generalize recent consequences to $2 \otimes N$ and $4\otimes N$ dimensional
Hilbert spaces ($N\geq 2$) and show that, after stereographic projection, the
quaternionic and octonionic terms are entanglement sensitive. These trends are
easily confirmed by direct computation for general multi-particle W- and
GHZ-states.

investigate the existence of identifiable correlations between the subsurface
structural disturbances and the activity level of the active regions. The
disturbances examined in this study are $<|\delta \Gamma_1/\Gamma_1|>$,
$<|\delta c^2/c^2|>$, and $<|\delta c^2/c^2-\delta \Gamma_1/\Gamma_1|>$. where
$\Gamma_1$ and $c$ are the thermodynamic properties of first adiabatic index
and sound speed modified by magnetic field, respectively. The averages are over
three depth layers: $0.975-0.98 R_\odot$, $0.98-0.99 R_\odot$ and $0.99-0.995
R_\odot$ to represent the structural disturbances in that layer. The level of
the surface magnetic activity is measured by the Magnetic Activity Index (MAI)
of active region and the relative and absolute MAI differences (rdMAI and dMAI)
between the active and quiet regions. The eruptivity of each active region is
quantified by its Flare Index, total number of coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
and total kinetic energy of the CMEs. The existence and level of the
correlations are evaluated by scatter plots and correlation coefficients. No
definitive correlation can be claimed from the results. While a weak positive
trend is visible between dMAI and $<|\delta \Gamma_1/\Gamma_1|>$ and $<|\delta
c^2/c^2|>$ in the layer $0.975-0.98 R_\odot$, their correlation levels, being
approximately 0.6, are not sufficiently high to justify the correlation. Some
subsurface disturbances are seen to increase with eruptivity indices among ARs
with high eruptivity. The statistical significance of such trend, however,
cannot be ascertained due to the small number of very eruptive ARs in our
sample.

of steps to authorized users such that all constraints are satisfied). Work in
the literature focuses on the workflow satisfiability problem, a
\emph{decision} problem that outputs a valid plan if the instance is
satisfiable (and a negative result otherwise).
  In this paper, we introduce the \textsc{Bi-Objective Workflow Satisfiability
Problem} (\BOWSP), which enables us to solve \emph{optimization} problems
related to workflows and security policies. In particular, we are able to
compute a ""least bad"" plan when some components of the security policy may be
violated. In general, \BOWSP is intractable from both the classical and
parameterized complexity point of view. We prove there exists an
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm to compute a Pareto front for \BOWSP

  We also present a second algorithm to compute a Pareto front which uses mixed
integer programming (MIP). We compare the performance of both our algorithms on
synthetic instances, and show that the FPT algorithm outperforms the MIP-based
one by several orders of magnitude on most of the instances.
  Finally, we study the important question of workflow resiliency and prove new
results establishing that known decision problems are fixed-parameter tractable
when restricted to user-independent constraints. We then propose a new way of
modeling the availability of users and demonstrate that many questions related
to resiliency in the context of this new model may be reduced to instances of
\BOWSP.

evidence of angular momentum redistribution in stellar interiors that is not
reproduced by current evolution codes. In this context, transport by internal
gravity waves can play a role and could explain discrepancies between theory
and observations. The efficiency of the transport of angular momentum by waves
depends on their driving mechanism. While excitation by turbulence throughout
the convective zone has already been investigated, we know that penetrative
convection into the stably stratified radiative zone can also generate internal
gravity waves. Therefore, we aim at developing a semianalytical model to
estimate the generation of IGW by penetrative plumes below an upper convective
envelope. We derive the wave amplitude considering the pressure exerted by an
ensemble of plumes on the interface between the radiative and convective zones
as source term in the equation of momentum. We consider the effect of a thermal
transition from a convective gradient to a radiative one on the transmission of
the wave into the radiative zone. The plume-induced wave energy flux at the top
of the radiative zone is computed for a solar model and is compared to the
turbulence-induced one. We show that, for the solar case, penetrative
convection generates waves more efficiently than turbulence and that
plume-induced waves can modify the internal rotation rate on shorter time
scales. We also show that a smooth thermal transition significatively enhances
the wave transmission compared to the case of a steep transition. We conclude
that driving by penetrative convection must be taken into account as much as
turbulence-induced waves for the transport of internal angular momentum.

the colloids ($L \propto r/\phi$). However, to optimize the bijel structure
with respect to other parameters, e.g. quench rate, characterizing by $L$ alone
is insufficient. Hence, we have used confocal microscopy and X-ray CT to
characterize a range of bijels in terms of local and area-averaged interfacial

function of time, which has revealed an intriguing evolution up to 60 minutes

first established that checking the sign-stability of a Metzler sign-matrix can
be either characterized in terms of the Hurwitz stability of the unit
sign-matrix in the corresponding qualitative class, or in terms the negativity
of the diagonal elements of the Metzler sign-matrix and the acyclicity of the
associated directed graph. Similar results are obtained for the case of Metzler
block-matrices and Metzler mixed-matrices, the latter being a class of Metzler
matrices containing both sign- and real-type entries. The problem of assessing
the sign-stability of the convex hull of a finite and summable family of
Metzler matrices is also solved, and a necessary and sufficient condition for
the existence of common Lyapunov functions for all the matrices in the convex
hull is obtained. The concept of sign-stability is then generalized to the
concept of Ker$_+(B)$-sign-stability, a problem that arises in the analysis of
certain jump Markov processes. A sufficient condition for the
Ker$_+(B)$-sign-stability of Metzler sign-matrices is obtained and formulated
using inverses of sign-matrices and the concept of $L^+$-matrices. Several

connected to energy released by interactions of high-velocity clouds with the
galactic disk, may be partly responsible both for the destruction of CO clouds
and for the creation of others. It is not known which effect prevails. We study
the relation between HI shells and CO in the outer parts of the Milky Way,
using HI and CO surveys and a catalogue of previously identified HI shells. For
each individual location, the distance to the nearest HI shell is calculated
and it is specified whether it lies in the interior of an HI shell, in its

of HI shells. We find a lack of CO clouds in the interiors of HI shells and
their increased occurrence in walls. Properties of clouds differ for different
environments: interiors of HI shells, their walls, and unperturbed medium. CO
clouds found in the interiors of HI shells are those that survived and were
robbed of their more diffuse gas. Walls of HI shells have a high molecular
content, indicative of an increased rate of CO formation. Comparing the CO
fractions within HI shells and outside in the unperturbed medium, we conclude
that HI shells are responsible for approx. 20 % increase in the total amount of

self-reported expertise. Second, we showed that there is a clear position bias,
but technical domain experts were less affected by position bias. Third, we
found that general expertise helped finding the correct answers, but the domain
experts were more successful as they managed to detect better answers. Our work
is using explicit tests to determine user expertise levels, which is an
important step toward fully automatic detection of expertise levels based on
interaction behavior. A deeper understanding of the impact of expertise on
search behavior and task outcome can enable more effective use of expert
behavior in search logs - essentially make everyone search as an expert.

the selected function satisfies a non-asymptotic oracle type inequality under
minimal assumptions on the statistical setting. We derive an adaptive piecewise
constant estimator on a random partition that achieves the expected rate of
convergence over (possibly inhomogeneous and anisotropic) Besov spaces of small

model selection theorem under very mild assumptions on the statistical setting.
This theorem guarantees the existence of estimators possessing nice statistical

estimates of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass,
$\varepsilon$. The Taylor-Goldstein equation is solved to find the maximum
growth rate of small disturbances to these averaged flows, and the critical
gradient Richardson number, $\textrm{Ri}_\textrm{c}$. The proportion of
unstable periods where the minimum gradient Richardson number,
$\textrm{Ri}_{\textrm{min}}$, is less than $\textrm{Ri}_\textrm{c}$ is about
35%. Cases are found in which $\textrm{Ri}_\textrm{c} <$ 0.25; 37% of the flows

$\textrm{Ri}_\textrm{c}<$ 0.24 in 68% of the periods where

Ri$_{\textrm{min}}$$/$Ri$_\textrm{c}$ $<$ 1.2 occur in 30% of the periods

disturbance has its maximum amplitude is examined to assess whether the
turbulence there is isotropic and how it relates to the Wave-Turbulence
boundary. It is concluded that there is a background level of dissipation that
is augmented by instability; instability of the averaged flow does not account
for all the turbulence observed in mid-water. The effects of a horizontal
separation of the measurements of shear and buoyancy are considered. The
available data do not support the hypothesis that the turbulent flows observed
on the UK shelf adjust rapidly to conditions that are close to being marginal,
or that flows in a particular location and period of time in one sea have
stability characteristics that are very similar to those in another.

galaxy NGC 2683 are presented. Archival C array data were processed and added
to the new observations. To investigate the 3D structure of the atomic gas
disk, we made different 3D models for which we produced model HI data cubes.
The main ingredients of our best-fit model are (i) a thin disk inclined by 80
degrees; (ii) a crude approximation of a spiral and/or bar structure by an
elliptical surface density distribution of the gas disk; (iii) a slight warp in
inclination; (iv) an exponential flare; and (v) a low surface-density gas ring.
The slope of NGC 2683's flare is comparable, but somewhat steeper than those of
other spiral galaxies. NGC 2683's maximum height of the flare is also
comparable to those of other galaxies. On the other hand, a saturation of the
flare is only observed in NGC 2683. Based on the comparison between the high
resolution model and observations, we exclude the existence of an extended
atomic gas halo around the optical and thin gas disk. Under the assumption of
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium we derive the vertical velocity dispersion of
the gas. The high turbulent velocity dispersion in the flare can be explained
by energy injection by (i) supernovae, (ii) magneto-rotational instabilities,
(iii) ISM stirring by dark matter substructure, or (iv) external gas accretion.
The existence of the complex large-scale warping and asymmetries favors
external gas accretion as one of the major energy sources that drives
turbulence in the outer gas disk. We propose a scenario where this external
accretion leads to turbulent adiabatic compression that enhances the turbulent
velocity dispersion and might quench star formation in the outer gas disk of
NGC 2683.

form of societal impact measurements. Recently, Altmetric - a start-up
providing publication level metrics - started to make data for publications
available which have been mentioned in policy documents. We regard this data
source as an interesting possibility to specifically measure the (societal)
impact of research. Using a comprehensive dataset with publications on climate
change as an example, we study the usefulness of the new data source for impact
measurement. Only 1.2% (n=2,341) out of 191,276 publications on climate change
in the dataset have at least one policy mention. We further reveal that papers
published in Nature and Science as well as from the areas ""Earth and related
environmental sciences"" and ""Social and economic geography"" are especially

this new source of altmetric data. Further empirical studies are necessary in
upcoming years, because mentions in policy documents are of special interest in
the use of altmetric data for measuring target-oriented the broader impact of
research.

expand observable quantities in Taylor series and to directly compare those
expansions with data. We adopt this strategy and we propose a fully
self-consistent parametrization of the total energy density driving the late
time universe speed up. Afterwards, we describe a feasible \emph{cosmographic
dark energy model}, in which matter is fixed whereas dark energy evolves by
means of the cosmographic series. Our technique provides robust constraints on
cosmokinematic parameters, permitting one to separately bound matter from dark
energy densities. Our cosmographic dark energy model turns out to be one
parameter only, but differently from the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it does not
contain ansatz on the dark energy form. In addition, we even determine the free
parameter of our model in suitable $1\sigma$ intervals through Monte Carlo
analyses based on the Metropolis algorithm. We compare our results with the
standard concordance model and we find that our treatment seems to indicate
that dark energy slightly evolves in time, reducing to a pure cosmological
constant only as $z\rightarrow0$.

deterministic. As an alternative, this paper proposes a statistical indicator
system based on linear eigenvalue statistics (LESs) of large random matrices:
1) from a data modeling viewpoint, we build, starting from power flows
equations, the random matrix models (RMMs) only using the real-time data flow
in a statistical manner; 2) for a data analysis that is fully driven from RMMs,
we put forward the high-dimensional indicators, called LESs that have some
unique statistical features such as Gaussian properties; and 3) we develop a
three-dimensional (3D) power-map to visualize the system, respectively, from a
high-dimensional viewpoint and a low-dimensional one. Therefore, a statistical
methodology of SA is employed; it conducts SA with a model-free and data-driven
procedure, requiring no knowledge of system topologies, units operation/control
models, causal relationship, etc. This methodology has numerous advantages,
such as sensitivity, universality, speed, and flexibility. In particular, its
robustness against bad data is highlighted, with potential advantages in cyber

prove feasible along with this line of work, although this critical development

to astrophysics, nuclear energy, and stockpile stewardship are cross sections
for reactions of neutrons with rare isotopes. Since direct measurements are
often not feasible, indirect methods, e.g. (d,p) reactions, should be used.
Those (d,p) reactions may be viewed as three-body reactions and described with
Faddeev techniques. Purpose. Faddeev equations in momentum space have a long
tradition of utilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of
coupled integral equations in one variable. Optical potentials representing the
effective interactions in the neutron (proton) nucleus subsystem are usually
non-Hermitian as well as energy-dependent. Potential matrix elements as well as
transition matrix elements calculated with them must fulfill the reciprocity
theorem. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a separable,
energy-dependent representation of complex, energy-dependent optical potentials
that fulfill reciprocity exactly. Results. Starting from a separable,
energy-independent representation of global optical potentials based on a
generalization of the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme, a further
generalization is needed to take into account the energy dependence.
Applications to n$+^{48}$Ca, n$+^{208}$Pb, and p$+^{208}$Pb are investigated
for energies from 0 to 50~MeV with special emphasis on fulfilling reciprocity.
Conclusions. We find that the energy-dependent separable representation of
complex, energy-dependent phenomenological optical potentials fulfills
reciprocity exactly. In addition, taking into account the explicit energy
dependence slightly improves the description of the $S$ matrix elements.

The magnetic susceptibility shows a weak anomaly at $T_{SRO}$ and no anomaly at

curve with 98% coverage at a 1-minute cadence. A significant signature in the
light curve comes from discrete cloud features. We compare results extracted
from the light curve data with contemporaneous disk-resolved imaging of Neptune
from the Keck 10-meter telescope at 1.65 microns and Hubble Space Telescope
visible imaging acquired 9 months later. This direct comparison validates the
feature latitudes assigned to the K2 light curve periods based on Neptune's
zonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. Although
Neptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,
a single large discrete storm seen in Keck imaging dominates the K2 and Hubble
light curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-term
brightness variability. The K2 Neptune light curve, in conjunction with our
imaging data, provides context for the interpretation of current and future
brown dwarf and extrasolar planet variability measurements. In particular we
suggest that the balance between large, relatively stable, atmospheric features

  Ordinary Powers of Certain Monomial Ideals","5 pages",,,,"math.AG math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this note is to find an elemenary explanation of a surprising
result of Ein--Lazarsfeld--Smith \cite{ELS} and Hochster--Huneke \cite{HH} on
the containment between symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals in simple cases.
This line of research has been very active ever since, see for instance
\cites{BC,HaH,DST} and the references therein, by now the literature on this
topic is quite extensive. By `elementary' we refer to arguments that among
others do not make use of resolution of singularities and multiplier ideals nor
tight closure methods. Let us quickly recall the statement \cite{ELS}: let $X$
be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$, $S \subseteq O_X$ a non-zero
sheaf of radical ideals with zero scheme $Z\subseteq X$; if every irreducible
component of $Z$ has codimension at least $e$, then \[
  S^{(me)}_Z \subseteq S^m_Z \] for all $m\geq 1$. Our goal is to reprove this
assertion in the case of points in projective spaces (as asked in
\cite{PAGII}*{Example 11.3.5}) without recurring to deep methods of algebraic
geometry. Instead of working with subsets of projective space, we will
concentrate on the affine cones over them; our aim hence becomes to understand
symbolic and ordinary powers ideals of sets of line through the origin. We will
end up reducing the general case to a study of the ideals \[ I_{2,n}
=(x_ix_j\mid 1\leq i<j\leq n) \subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n] \] defining the union
of coordinate axes in $\AA^n_{k}$. We work over an arbitrary field $k$. Our
main result is as follows. Let $\Sigma\subseteq P^{n-1}$ be a set of $n$ points
not lying in a hyperplane. Then \[
  S_{\Sigma}^{(\lceil (2-\frac{2}{n})m \rceil) } \subseteq S^m_{\Sigma} \] for
all positive integers $m$. If $n=3$, then the same statement holds for three
distinct points in arbitrary position.

Demoulin (1999) under the regime of weak twist, the cold and dense prominence
counteracts gravity by modifying the initially force-free magnetic
configuration. In some cases a quasi-stationary situation is achieved after the
relaxation phase, characterized by the excitation of standing vertical
oscillations. These oscillations show a strong attenuation with time produced
by the mechanism of continuum damping due to the inhomogeneous transition
between the prominence and solar corona. The characteristic period of the
vertical oscillations does not depend strongly on the twist of the flux rope.
Nonlinearity is the responsible for triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
associated to the vertical oscillations and that eventually produces horizontal
structures. Contrary to other configurations in which the longitudinal axis of
the prominence is permeated by a perpendicular magnetic field, like in
unsheared arcades, the orientation of the prominence along the flux rope axis
prevents the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and therefore the
appearance of vertical structuring along this axis.

requires dealing with transitions labeled by rates. With respect to standard
process algebra semantics this poses a problem: we have to take into account
the multiplicity of several identical transitions (with the same rate). Several
techniques addressing this problem have been introduced in the literature, but
they can only be used for semantic definitions that do not exploit a structural

using a structural congruence relation is a useful mechanism that is commonly
adopted, for instance, in order to define semantics in reduction style for

A prediction of single-degenerate models is that H- (or He-) rich material from
the envelope of the companion star should be swept up by the SN ejecta in the
explosion. Seven SNe Ia have been analysed to date looking for signs of H-rich
material in their late-time spectra and none were detected. We present results
from new late-time spectra of 11 SNe Ia obtained at the Very Large Telescope
using XShooter and FORS2. We present the tentative detection of H-alpha
emission for SN 2013ct, corresponding to ~0.007 Msun of stripped/ablated
companion star material (under the assumptions of the spectral modelling). This
mass is significantly lower than expected for single-degenerate scenarios,
suggesting that >0.1 Msun of H-rich is present but not observed. We do not
detect H-alpha emission in the other 10 SNe Ia. This brings the total sample of
normal SNe Ia with non-detections (<0.001-0.058 Msun) of H-rich material to 17
events. The simplest explanation for these non-detections is that these objects
did not result from the explosion of a CO white dwarf accreting matter from a
H-rich companion star via Roche-lobe overflow or symbiotic channels. However,
further spectral modelling is needed to confirm this. We also find no evidence

of optical energy, confined and shaped by the nanoscale device geometry.
Near-field optical probes can image this distribution, but the physical probe
necessarily perturbs the near field, which is particularly problematic for
sensitive high quality factor resonances. We present a new approach to mapping
nanophotonic modes that uses a controllably small and local optomechanical
perturbation introduced by a focused lithium ion beam. An ion beam (radius
about 50 nm) induces a picometer-scale dynamic deformation of the resonator
surface, which we detect through a shift in the optical resonance wavelength.
We map five modes of a silicon microdisk resonator (Q > 20,000) with both high
spatial and spectral resolution. Our technique also enables in-situ observation
of ion implantation damage and relaxation dynamics in a silicon lattice.

shown to yield improved enhancements over conventional DNP techniques, and even
to shorten polarization build-up times. The resulting increase in
signal-to-noise ratios can lead to significantly shorter acquisition times in
signal-limited multi-dimensional NMR experiments and pave the way to the study
of even smaller sample volumes. In this paper we describe the design and
performance of a broadband system for microwave frequency- and
amplitude-modulated DNP that has been engineered to minimize both microwave and
thermal losses during operation at liquid helium temperatures. The system
incorporates a flexible source that can generate arbitrary waveforms at 94 GHz
with a bandwidth greater than 1 GHz, as well as a probe that efficiently
transmits the millimeter waves from room temperature outside the magnet to a
cryogenic environment inside the magnet. Using a thin-walled brass tube as an
overmoded waveguide to transmit a hybrid HE11 mode, it is possible to limit the
losses to 1 dB across a 2 GHz bandwidth. The loss is dominated by the presence
of a quartz window used to isolate the waveguide pipe. This performance is
comparable to systems with corrugated waveguide or quasi-optical components.
The overall excitation bandwidth of the probe is seen to be primarily
determined by the final antenna or resonator used to excite the sample and its
coupling to the NMR RF coil. Understanding the instrumental limitations imposed
on any modulation scheme is key to understanding the observed DNP results and
potentially identifying the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrate the utility
of our design with a set of triangular frequency-modulated DNP experiments.

This can be explained by a competition with the Mott insulating phase which

question which voltage is induced in an open wire with a time-varying
homogeneous magnetic field. In contrast to closed wires where the voltage is
determined by the time variance of magnetic field and enclosed area, in an open
wire we have to integrate the electric field along the wire. It is found that
the longitudinal electric field contributes with 1/3 and the transverse field
with 2/3 to the induced voltage. In order to find the electric fields the
sources of the magnetic fields are necessary to know. The representation of a
homogeneous and time-varying magnetic field implies unavoidably a certain
symmetry point or symmetry line which depend on the geometry of the source. As
a consequence the induced voltage of an open wire is found to be the area
covered with respect to this symmetry line or point perpendicular to the
magnetic field. This in turn allows to find the symmetry points of a magnetic
field source by measuring the voltage of an open wire placed with different
angles in the magnetic field. We present exactly solvable models for a symmetry

initial energy densities with large spatial gradients. This is associated with
the presence of large Knudsen numbers ($K_n\approx 1$) at early times, which
may lead one to question the validity of the hydrodynamic approach in these
rapidly evolving, largely inhomogeneous systems. A new procedure to smooth out
the initial energy densities is employed to show that the initial spatial
eccentricities, $\varepsilon_n$, are remarkably robust with respect to
variations in the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients,
$\lambda$. For $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV LHC initial conditions generated by the
MCKLN code, $\varepsilon_n$ (across centralities) remains nearly constant if
the fluctuation scale varies by an order of magnitude, i.e., when $\lambda$
varies from 0.1 to 1 fm. Given that the local Knudsen number $K_n\approx
\frac{1}{\lambda}$, the robustness of the initial eccentricities with respect
to changes in the fluctuation scale suggests that the vn's cannot be used to
distinguish between events with large $K_n$ from events where $K_n$ is in the
hydrodynamic regime. We use the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code v-USPhydro to
show that this is indeed the case: anisotropic flow coefficients computed
within event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics are only sensitive to long
wavelength scales of order $\frac{1}{\Lambda_{QCD}}\approx 1$ fm and are
incredibly robust with respect to variations in the initial local Knudsen
number. This robustness can be used to justify the somewhat unreasonable
effectiveness of the nearly perfect fluid paradigm in heavy ion collisions.

of natural resources. At the same time, fire plays a vital role in restoring
ecological balance in many ecosystems. Fuel management, or treatment planning
by way of planned burning, is an important tool used in many countries where
fire is a major ecosystem process. In this paper, we propose an approach to
reduce the spatial connectivity of fuel hazards while still considering the
ecological fire requirements of the ecosystem. A mixed integer programming
(MIP) model is formulated in such a way that it breaks the connectivity of
high-risk regions as a means to reduce fuel hazards in the landscape. This
multi-period model tracks the age of each vegetation type and determines the
optimal time and locations to conduct fuel treatments. The minimum and maximum
Tolerable Fire Intervals (TFI), which define the ages at which certain
vegetation type can be treated for ecological reasons, are taken into account
by the model. Previous work has been limited to using single vegetation types
implemented within rectangular grids. In this paper, we significantly extend
previous work by modelling multiple vegetation types implemented within a
polygon-based network. Thereby a more realistic representation of the landscape
is achieved. An analysis of the proposed approach was conducted for a fuel
treatment area comprising 711 treatment units in the Barwon-Otway district of
Victoria, Australia. The solution of the proposed model can be obtained for
20-year fuel treatment planning within a reasonable computation time of eight
hours.

an essential part of an ergonomic approach in user-centered design. Assessments

a reach envelope determined entirely by the segment lengths, without taking
into account external variables, as the nature of the task or the physical
capacities of the subject, which may influence the results. Considering the
body as a simple assembly of static parts of different anthropometry is
limiting. In this paper, the limit of validity of this approach is assessed by
comparing the reach envelopes obtained by this method to those obtained with a
simple two-dimensional experimental reaching task of a panel of subjects. Forty
subjects experimentally evaluated the reach, first with the body constrained
and second unconstrained. Results were recorded and compared with those
obtained numerically with a model, based on their own anthropometric
characteristics, previously measured. A statistical study of the results
allowed the definition of the shape of a confidence bound containing the real

Second, anthropometric characteristics of participants were recorded and used
