  Precision/Personalized Evidence-Based Medicine",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Precision medicine emerges as the most important contemporary paradigm shift
of medical practice but has several challenges in evidence formation and
implementation for clinical practice. Precision/Personalized evidence-based
medicine (pEBM) requires theoretical support for decision making and
information management. This study aims to provide the required methodological
framework. Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence mainly rests upon
Generalized Theory of Uncertainty which manages information as generalized
constraints rather than limited statistical data, and also Prototype
Resemblance Theory of Disease which defines diseases/conditions when there is a
similarity relationship with prototypes (best examples of the disease). The
proposed theory explains that precisely-personalized structure of evidence is
formed as a generalized constraint on particular research questions, where the
constraining relation deals with averaged effect sizes of studies and its
comparison to null hypothesis; which might be of either probabilistic or
possibilistic nature. Similarity measures were employed to deal with
comparisons of high-dimensional characteristics. Real examples of a
meta-analysis and its clinical application are provided. This is one of the
first attempts for introducing a framework in medicine, which provides optimal
balance between generalizability of formed evidence and homogeneity of studied
populations.

the Kendall's rank correlation between the order of desired goods and actor's

approximation to very fast rotating flows often observed in nature. The low
dimensionality of the system allows the investigation of a wide range of fluid

Rmc becomes a constant in the large Re limit. A helical flow always results in
dynamo in agreement with mean field predictions. For thin layers for both

""Experimental evidence supporting the conception of adaptation energy"".
Adaptation of an animal to different factors appears as the spending of one
resource. Adaptation energy is a hypothetical extensive quantity spent for
adaptation. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a
physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. The controversial points of view
impede the systematic use of the notion of adaptation energy despite
experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the response to many harmful factors often
has general non-specific form and we suggest that the mechanisms of
physiological adaptation admit a very general and nonspecific description.
  We aim to demonstrate that Selye's adaptation energy is the cornerstone of
the top-down approach to modelling of non-specific adaptation processes. We
analyse Selye's axioms of adaptation energy together with Goldstone's
modifications and propose a series of models for interpretation of these
axioms. {\em Adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the
`dominant path' in the model of adaptation}. The phenomena of `oscillating
death' and `oscillating remission' are predicted on the base of the dynamical
models of adaptation. Natural selection plays a key role in the evolution of
mechanisms of physiological adaptation. We use the fitness optimization
approach to study of the distribution of resources for neutralization of
harmful factors, during adaptation to a multifactor environment, and analyse
the optimal strategies for different systems of factors.

are detected at energies up to 20 keV. We measure a photon index $\Gamma=
1.65\pm0.24$ (90% confidence) for the power law fit to the non-thermal
emission. It had been shown that spectral models with two or three thermal
components fit the XMM-Newton spectrum of PSR J0437-4715, depending on the
slope of the power-law component, and the amount of absorption of soft X-rays.
The new constraint on the high-energy emission provided by NuSTAR removes
ambiguities regarding the thermal components of the emission below 3 keV. We
performed a simultaneous spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data to
confirm that three thermal components and a power law are required to fit the
0.3-20 keV emission of PSR J0437-4715. Adding a ROSAT-PSPC spectrum further
confirmed this result and allowed us to better constrain the temperatures of
the three thermal components. A phase-resolved analysis of the NuSTAR data
revealed no significant change in the photon index of the high-energy emission.
This NuSTAR observation provides further impetus for future observations with
the NICER mission (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) whose
sensitivity will provide much stricter constraints on the equation of state of

dimensional algebras motivated by the emerging theory of graph limits.
  We introduce the rank spectrum of a finite dimensional algebra $R$ over a
finite field. The elements of the rank spectrum are representations of the
algebra into von Neumann regular rank algebras, and two representations are
considered to be equivalent if they induce the same Sylvester rank functions on
$R$-matrices.
  Based on this approach, we can divide the finite dimensional algebras into
three types: finite, amenable and non-amenable representation types. We prove
that string algebras are of amenable representation type, but the wild
Kronecker algebras are not. Here, the amenability of the rank algebras
associated to the limit points in the rank spectrum plays a very important
part.
  We also show that the limit points of finite dimensional representations of
algebras of amenable representation type can always be viewed as
representations of the algebra in the continuous ring invented by John von
Neumann in the 1930's.
  As an application in algorithm theory, we introduce and study the notion of
testing of parameters of modules over finite dimensional algebras, that is
analogous to the property testing of bounded degree graphs introduced by
Goldreich and Ron. We shall see that for string algebras all the reasonable
(stable) parameters are testable.

violation in Delta F=1 processes the bound on CP violation in Kaon mixing
generically leads to an upper bound on the size of CP violation in D mixing.
Interestingly, this bound is similar in magnitude to the current sensitivity
reached by the LHCb experiment which is starting now to probe the natural

considerations, we derive an axiomatic definition of Hopf-algebra gauge theory,
including locality conditions under which the theory for a general ribbon graph
can be assembled from local data in the neighbourhood of each vertex. For a
vertex neighbourhood with n incoming edge ends, the algebra of non-commutative
""functions"" of connections is dual to a two-sided twist deformation of the
n-fold tensor power of the gauge Hopf algebra. We show these algebras assemble
to give an algebra of functions and gauge-invariant subalgebra of ""observables""

Chern-Simons theory, thus providing an axiomatic derivation of the latter. We
then discuss holonomy in a Hopf algebra gauge theory and show that for
semisimple Hopf algebras this gives, for each path in the embedded graph, a map
from connections into the gauge Hopf algebra, depending functorially on the
path. Curvatures -- holonomies around the faces canonically associated to the
ribbon graph -- then correspond to central elements of the algebra of
observables, and define a set of commuting projectors onto the subalgebra of
observables on flat connections. The algebras of observables for all
connections or for flat connections are topological invariants, depending only

measurement of the gluon helicity contribution, $\Delta G$, to the proton spin
via measuring the double longitudinal spin asymmetry ($A_{LL}$) in various
channels. In PHENIX (Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment) the
$A_{LL}$ in $\pi^{0}$, $\eta$, $J/\psi$ etc. are measured in wide rapidity
range. In this talk, $A_{LL}$ in $\pi^{0}$ production in central rapidity and
$J/\psi$ production in forward rapidity will be discussed. The $\pi^{0}$ is
reconstructed through its diphoton decay channel within the rapidity range of
$\left| \eta \right|$ $<$ 0.35 and azimuthal angle of $180\,^{\circ}$.
Similarly, $J/\psi$ is reconstructed via dimuon decay channel within the
rapidity range of 1.2 $<$ $\left| \eta \right|$ $<$ 2.2. Preliminary results
for $A_{LL}$ in $\pi^{0}$ and $J/\psi$ production from the data collected in
the year 2013 at center of mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$) = 510 GeV will be
presented. Also, their impact on $\Delta G$ constraint will be discussed. In
year 2013, the total integrated luminosity was 150 $pb^{-1}$ which is almost
ten times the total luminosity recorded in the year 2009 at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200
GeV. Due to increase in the center of mass energy and integrated luminosity,
the new measurements can cover the Bjorken x range down to 0.01 for $\pi^{0}$
and 0.002 for $J/\psi$.

been used to understand conditions for species coexistence. However, these
models fail to account for random fluctuations due to demographic and
environmental stochasticity which are experienced by all populations. I review
some recent mathematical results about persistence and coexistence for models
accounting for each of these forms of stochasticity. Demographic stochasticity
stems from populations and communities consisting of a finite number of
interacting individuals, and often are represented by Markovian models with a
countable number of states. For closed populations in a bounded world,
extinction occurs in finite time but may be preceded by long-term transients.
Quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) of these Makov models characterize this
meta-stable behavior. For sufficiently large ""habitat sizes"", QSDs are shown to
concentrate on the positive attractors of deterministic models. Moreover, the
probability extinction decreases exponentially with habitat size.
Alternatively, environmental stochasticity stems from fluctuations in
environmental conditions which influence survival, growth, and reproduction.
Stochastic difference equations can be used to model the effects of
environmental stochasticity on population and community dynamics. For these
models, stochastic persistence corresponds to empirical measures placing
arbitrarily little weight on arbitrarily low population densities. Sufficient
and necessary conditions for stochastic persistence are reviewed. These
conditions involve weighted combinations of Lyapunov exponents corresponding to
""average"" per-capita growth rates of rare species. The results are illustrated
with Bay checkerspot butterflies, coupled sink populations, the storage effect,
and stochastic rock-paper-scissor communities. Open problems and conjectures
are presented.

Neural Nets (CNN) have shown to be a powerful tool that eliminate the need for
designing handcrafted features. Usually, the output of the last layer in CNN (a

feature for images. In this paper, we show that fc7 features, per se, can not

which can capture the temporal variation in a video. To represent the temporal

hierarchical structure. The hierarchical model enables to capture sub-actions
from a complex action. At the higher levels of the hierarchy, it represents a
coarse capture of action sequence and lower levels represent fine action
elements. Furthermore, we introduce a method for extracting key-frames using
binary coding of each frame in a video, which helps to improve the performance

as cell regulatory networks and enzyme cascades. Isothermal, well-mixed systems
can be modelled as Markov processes, typically simulated using the Gillespie
Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). While easy to implement and exact, the
computational cost of using the Gillespie SSA to simulate such systems can
become prohibitive as the frequency of reaction events increases. This has
motivated numerous coarse-grained schemes, where the ""fast"" reactions are
approximated either using Langevin dynamics or deterministically. While such
approaches provide a good approximation when all reactants are abundant, the
approximation breaks down when one or more species exist only in small
concentrations and the fluctuations arising from the discrete nature of the
reactions becomes significant. This is particularly problematic when using such
methods to compute statistics of extinction times for chemical species, as well
as simulating non-equilibrium systems such as cell-cycle models in which a
single species can cycle between abundance and scarcity. In this paper, a
hybrid jump-diffusion model for simulating well- mixed stochastic kinetics is
derived. It acts as a bridge between the Gillespie SSA and the chemical
Langevin equation. For low reactant reactions the underlying behaviour is
purely discrete, while purely diffusive when the concentrations of all species
is large, with the two different behaviours coexisting in the intermediate
region. A bound on the weak error in the classical large volume scaling limit
is obtained, and three different numerical discretizations of the
jump-diffusion model are described. The benefits of such a formalism are
illustrated using computational examples.

the typical value of normal SNe Ia (i.e., 0.3 -- 0.4 M$_{\sun}$) and is also
lower than the value of SN 1991T (i.e., $\sim$\,0.18 M$_{\sun}$). These results

symmetric nuclear medium using a linear sigma model. Our calculation shows that
these decay widths in the nuclear medium increase by up to a factor of four to
ten compared with those in the free space mainly depending on the mass of the

enhancements are considerable even at a half of the normal nuclear density.
Thus, the $\eta$ decay into $3\pi$ could be a possible new probe for the chiral
restoration in the nuclear medium. We find that the density dependence of the
$\eta\rightarrow3\pi^0$ decay is moderate in comparison with that of
$\eta\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$, although the former width is greater than the
latter one at a given density. This is because the softening of the sigma meson
causes cancellation of the terms appearing from the Bose symmetry in the

should be helpful for experimental confirmation of the findings of the present

-10^6 L_\odot$) that drive strong stellar winds through UV line-scattering.
Some massive stars also have disks, formed by either decretion from the star
(as in the rapidly rotating ""Classical Be stars""), or accretion during the
star's formation. This dissertation examines the role of stellar radiation in
driving (ablating) material away from these circumstellar disks.
  A key result is that the observed month to year decay of Classical Be disks
can be explained by line-driven ablation without, as previously done, appealing
to anomalously strong viscous diffusion. Moreover, the higher luminosity of O
stars leads to ablation of optically thin disks on dynamical timescales of
order a day, providing a natural explanation for the lack of observed Oe stars.
In addition to the destruction of Be disks, this dissertation also introduces a
model for their formation by coupling observationally inferred non-radial
pulsation modes and rapid stellar rotation to launch material into orbiting
Keplerian disks.
  In contrast to such Be decretion disks, star-forming accretion disks are much
denser and so are generally optically thick to continuum processes. To
circumvent the computational challenges associated with radiation hydrodynamics
through optically thick media, we develop an approximate method for treating
continuum absorption in the limit of geometrically thin disks. The comparison
of ablation with and without continuum absorption shows that accounting for
disk optical thickness leads to less than a 50$\%$ reduction in ablation rate,
implying that ablation rate depends mainly on stellar properties like
luminosity.

lattice noise significantly extends duration of the Zitterbewegung as compared

introduced. After reviewing the original construction based on its Hamiltonian
in the vielbein formalism, we reformulate it in terms of its Lagrangian in both
the vielbein and the metric formalisms. It then becomes obvious that, unlike
previous attempts in the literature of Lorentz-violating massive gravity, not
only the potential but also the kinetic structure of the action is modified
from the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. We confirm
that the number of physical degrees of freedom in MTMG is two at fully
nonlinear level. This proves the absence of various possible pathologies such
as superluminality, acausality and strong coupling. Afterwards, we discuss the
phenomenology of MTMG in the presence of a dust fluid. We find that on a flat
homogeneous and isotropic background we have two branches. One of them
(self-accelerating branch) naturally leads to acceleration without the genuine
cosmological constant or dark energy. For this branch both the scalar and the
vector modes behave exactly as in general relativity (GR). The phenomenology of
this branch differs from GR in the tensor modes sector, as the tensor modes
acquire a non-zero mass. Hence, MTMG serves as a stable nonlinear completion of
the self-accelerating cosmological solution found originally in dRGT theory.
The other branch (normal branch) has a dynamics which depends on the
time-dependent fiducial metric. For the normal branch, the scalar mode sector,
even though as in GR only one scalar mode is present (due to the dust fluid),
differs from the one in GR, and, in general, structure formation will follow a
different phenomenology. The tensor modes will be massive, whereas the vector
modes, for both branches, will have the same phenomenology as in GR.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A heavy path in a weighted graph represents a notion of connectivity and
ordering that goes beyond two nodes. The heaviest path of length l in the
graph, simply means a sequence of nodes with edges between them, such that the
sum of edge weights is maximum among all paths of length l. It is trivial to
state the heaviest edge in the graph is the heaviest path of length 1, that
represents a heavy connection between (any) two existing nodes. This can be
generalized in many different ways for more than two nodes, one of which is
finding the heavy weight paths in the graph. In an influence network, this
represents a highway for spreading information from a node to one of its
indirect neighbors at distance l. Moreover, a heavy path implies an ordering of
nodes. For instance, we can discover which ordering of songs (tourist spots) on
a playlist (travel itinerary) is more pleasant to a user or a group of users
who enjoy all songs (tourist spots) on the playlist (itinerary). This can also
serve as a hard optimization problem, maximizing different types of quantities
of a path such as score, flow, probability or surprise, defined as edge weight.
Therefore, if one can solve the Heavy Path Problem (HPP) efficiently, they can
as well use HPP for modeling and reduce other complex problems to it.

algorithms, can we find a sub-problem for which quantum algorithms provide an
exponential advantage? We refer to this problem as the ""sculpting problem."" In
this work, we give a full characterization of sculptable functions in the query
complexity setting. We show that a total function f can be restricted to a
promise P such that Q(f|_P)=O(polylog(N)) and R(f|_P)=N^{Omega(1)}, if and only
if f has a large number of inputs with large certificate complexity. The proof
uses some interesting techniques: for one direction, we introduce new
relationships between randomized and quantum query complexity in various
settings, and for the other direction, we use a recent result from
communication complexity due to Klartag and Regev. We also characterize
sculpting for other query complexity measures, such as R(f) vs. R_0(f) and
R_0(f) vs. D(f).
  Along the way, we prove some new relationships for quantum query complexity:
for example, a nearly quadratic relationship between Q(f) and D(f) whenever the
promise of f is small. This contrasts with the recent super-quadratic query
complexity separations, showing that the maximum gap between classical and
quantum query complexities is indeed quadratic in various settings - just not
for total functions!
  Lastly, we investigate sculpting in the Turing machine model. We show that if
there is any BPP-bi-immune language in BQP, then every language outside BPP can
be restricted to a promise which places it in PromiseBQP but not in PromiseBPP.
Under a weaker assumption, that some problem in BQP is hard on average for
P/poly, we show that every paddable language outside BPP is sculptable in this

levels are modulated in time. The dynamics resulting from changes in the
transition frequency is a problem studied since the early days of quantum

theoretically since, with the simple two-state model providing an inexhaustible
source of novel concepts. When the transition frequency of a quantum system is
modulated, several phenomena can be observed, such as
Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg-Majorana interference, motional averaging and
narrowing, and the formation of dressed states with the presence of sidebands
in the spectrum. Adiabatic changes result in the accumulation of geometric
phases, which can be used to create topological states. In recent years, an
exquisite experimental control in the time domain was gained through the
parameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed
the state of the system to be monitored non-destructively. These developments
were made in the field of quantum devices, especially in superconducting
qubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases. As a
result of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate many of the
fundamental effects that arise in a quantum system when its transition
frequencies are modulated. The purpose of this review is to present some of
these developments, from two-state atoms and harmonic oscillators to multilevel

formula originates in the very initial state of the object system as seen when
the state is expanded with the eigen-projectors of the measured ob- servable.
Making use of the probability reproducibility condition, which is a key concept
in unitary measurement theory, one obtains the relevant coher- ent distribution
of the complete-measurement results in the final unitary- measurement state in
agreement with the mentioned probability formula. Treating the transition from
the final unitary, or premeasurement, state, where all possible results are
present, to one complete-measurement result sketchily in the usual way, the
well-known probability formula is derived. In conclusion it is pointed out that
the entire argument is only formal unless one makes it physical assuming that
the quantum probability law is valid in the extreme case of probability-one
(certain) events (projectors).

to relate the geometric phase to the quantum phase transition. For small values
of DM parameter, the Berry phase is more appropriate than the concurrence
measure, while for large values, the concurrence is a good indicator to show
the phase transition. On the other hand, by increasing the DM interaction the
phase transition occurs for large values of anisotropy parameter. In addition,
for small values of magnetic field the concurrence measure is appropriate

the Berry phase shows a sharp changes in the phase transition points. The
results show that the Berry phase and concurrence form a complementary system

parameterisation for mesoscale turbulence. A common recipe for such
parameterisations is to invoke down-gradient mixing, or diffusion, of some
tracer quantity, such as potential vorticity or buoyancy. However, it is well
known that eddy fluxes include large rotational components which necessarily do
not lead to any mixing; eddy diffusivities diagnosed from unfiltered fluxes are
thus contaminated by the presence of these rotational components. Here a new
methodology is applied whereby eddy diffusivities are diagnosed directly from
the eddy force function. The eddy force function depends only upon flux
divergences, is independent of any rotational flux components, and is
inherently non-local and smooth. A one-shot inversion procedure is applied,
minimising the mis-match between parameterised force functions and force
functions derived from eddy resolving calculations. This enables diffusivities
associated with the eddy potential vorticity and buoyancy fluxes to be
diagnosed. The methodology is applied to multi-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean
gyre simulations. It is found that: (i) a strictly down-gradient mixing scheme
has limited success in reducing the mis-match compared to one with no sign
constraint on the diffusivity; (ii) negative signals of diffusivities are
prevalent around the time-mean jet; (iii) there is some indication that the
magnitude of the diffusivity correlates well the eddy energy. Implications for
parameterisation are discussed in light of these diagnostic results.

  conjectural variations",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When calibrating spatial partial equilibrium models with conjectural
variations, some modelers fit the suppliers' sales to the available data in
addition to total consumption and price levels. While this certainly enhances
the quality of the calibration, it makes it difficult to accommodate
user-imposed bounds on the model parameters such as restricting the market
power parameters to the interval [0,1], which is a common requirement in
conjectural variations approaches. We propose an algorithm to calibrate the
suppliers' sales and simultaneously deal with user-defined bounds on
parameters. To this end, we fix the suppliers' sales at reference values and
obtain the marginal costs for each supplier and market. We then limit the
market power parameters to the interval [0,1], and calculate intervals of
anchor prices and price elasticities that reproduce the reference supplier
sales in the state of equilibrium. If these intervals do not contain the
reference price elasticities and prices, we face a mismatch between reality and
the model mechanics. We resolve this by altering the reference sales for the
critical suppliers, and iterate. Thereby, the user controls whether price
elasticities and anchor prices should be close to their reference values, or
the suppliers' sales. The algorithm is tested on data from the European gas
market, and required less than one minute to identify calibrated parameters.
Our algorithm is widely applicable, since it is based on mild (and common)
underlying assumptions and can be configured to suit a specific purpose thanks
to the inclusion of user-defined bounds on all relevant parameters.

elements that can potentially overcome severe channel attenuation by narrow
beamforming. Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser
interference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as
opposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited
regime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and
on proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet,
these regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design,
with the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance. In
this paper, we investigate these regimes in terms of collision probability and
throughput. We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision
probability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under
slotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a
non-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an
interference-limited one, depending on the density of the transmitters, density
and size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and
transmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of
adaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based
and contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free
phase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the
contention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of
interference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks. We
conclude that, unless proper hybrid schemes are investigated, the severity of
the transitional behavior may significantly reduce throughput/delay performance

captures the crack's path. Because the curvature-induced stresses are

follows a censored and shifted gamma (CSG) law with parameters depending on the

geometry as an emergent structure that shows classical features only at some
observational level. One can thus conceive the space-time manifold as a purely
theoretical arena, where quantum states are defined, with the additional
freedom of changing coordinates like any other symmetry. Observables, including
positions and distances, should then be described by suitable operators acting
on such quantum states. In principle, the top-down (canonical) quantisation of
Einstein-Hilbert gravity falls right into this picture, but is notoriously very
involved. The complication stems from allowing all the classical canonical
variables that appear in the (presumably) fundamental action to become quantum
observables acting on the ""superspace"" of all metrics, regardless of whether
they play any role in the description of a specific physical system. On can
instead revisit the more humble ""minisuperspace"" approach and choose the
gravitational observables not simply by imposing some symmetry, but motivated
by their proven relevance in the (classical) description of a given system. In
particular, this review focuses on compact, spherically symmetric, quantum
mechanical sources, in order to determine the probability they are black holes
rather than regular particles. The gravitational radius is therefore lifted to
the status of a quantum mechanical operator acting on the ""horizon

a physically meaningful object, called the horizon function. It directly enters
the expressions for many of the stellar characteristics. The main junction
equation, which governs the collapse, transforms into a Riccati equation with
simple coefficients for the horizon function. We integrate this equation in the
geodesic case. The same is done in the general case when one or another of the
coefficients vanish. It is shown how to build classes of star models in this

the increase of the radius of the shadow of the rotating black hole the
quintessential field parameter causes decrease of the distortion of the shadow

coupling (SOC) confined to a surface that is embedded in a three-dimensional
space spanned by a general Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinate (OCC) is
constructed. A gauge field formalism, where the SOC is expressed as a
non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field is used. A new practical approach, based on the
physical argument that upon confining the particle to the surface by a
potential, then it is the physical Hermitian momentum operator transverse to
the surface, rather than just the derivative with respect to the transverse
coordinate that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian.Doing so, it is shown
that the Hermitian Hamiltonian for SOC is obtained with the geometric potential
and the geometric kinetic energy terms emerging naturally. The geometric
potential is shown to represent a coupling between the transverse component of
the gauge field and the mean curvature of the surface that replaces the
coupling between the transverse momentum and the gauge field. The most general
Hermitian Hamiltonian with linear SOC on a general surface embedded in any 3D
OCC system is reported. Explicit plug-and-play formulae for this Hamiltonian on
the surfaces of a cylinder, a sphere and a torus are given. The formalism is
applied to the Rashba SOC in three dimensions (3D RSOC) and the explicit
expressions for the surface Hamiltonians on these three geometries are worked
out.

Alps, two of which in the Dolomites and one in the Julian Alps, and one in the
Maritime Alps, Northwest Italy. The simulations, based on actual data gathered
from contacts with rangers and parks administrators, field samplings and

are in a very delicate situation, for which the animal populations could become

  Geolocation Data","25 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DL physics.data-an physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Patent data represent a significant source of information on innovation and
the evolution of technology through networks of citations, co-invention and
co-assignment of new patents. A major obstacle to extracting useful information
from this data is the problem of name disambiguation: linking alternate
spellings of individuals or institutions to a single identifier to uniquely
determine the parties involved in the creation of a technology. In this paper,
we describe a new algorithm that uses high-resolution geolocation to
disambiguate both inventor and assignees on more than 3.6 million patents found
in the European Patent Office (EPO), under the Patent Cooperation treaty (PCT),
and in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We show that our algorithm
has both high precision and recall in comparison to a manual disambiguation of
EPO assignee names in Boston and Paris, and show it performs well for a
benchmark of USPTO inventor names that can be linked to a high-resolution
address (but poorly for inventors that never provided a high quality address).
The most significant benefit of this work is the high quality assignee
disambiguation with worldwide coverage coupled with an inventor disambiguation
that is competitive with other state of the art approaches. To our knowledge
this is the broadest and most accurate simultaneous disambiguation and
cross-linking of the inventor and assignee names for a significant fraction of
patents in these three major patent collections.
