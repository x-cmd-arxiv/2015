emitted in collisions of massless particles is studied perturbatively in the
context of classical General Relativity for small values of the ratio $\alpha=
2 r_S/b$ of the Schwarzschild radius over the impact parameter. The particles
are described with their trajectories, while the contribution of the leading
nonlinear terms of the gravitational action is also taken into account. The old
quantum results are reproduced in the zero frequency limit $\omega\ll 1/b$. The
radiation efficiency $\epsilon \equiv E_{\rm rad}/2E$ outside a narrow cone of
angle $\alpha$ in the forward and backward directions with respect to the
initial particle trajectories is given by $\epsilon \sim \alpha^2$ and is
dominated by radiation with characteristic frequency $\omega \sim {\mathcal
O}(1/r_S)$. The comparison with previous works and the known literature is
presented.

electrons from its channel-radius to collapse simultaneously exciting coherent

a blow-out electron bubble-wake. Here we explore positron acceleration in the

constraint. Numerous solutions have been proposed to alleviate the issue,
including clustering. Game theory is an effective decision-making tool that has
been shown to be effective in solving complex problems. In this paper, we
employ cooperative games and propose a new clustering scheme called Coalitional
Game-Theoretic Clustering (CGTC) algorithm for WSNs. The idea is to partition
the entire network area into two regions, namely far and vicinity, in order to
address the hotspot problem in WSNs, wherein nodes close to the base station
(BS) tend to deplete their energy faster due to relaying the traffic load
received from farther nodes. Then, coalitional games are utilized to group
nodes as coalitions. The main factor in choosing coalition heads is the energy
level of nodes so that the most powerful nodes play the role of heads. The
Shapley value is adopted as the solution concept to our coalitional games. The
results of simulations confirm the effectiveness of CGTC in terms of energy
efficiency and improved throughput.

experimenter with a hypothetical charged harmonic oscillator as his equipment.
We describe the observations of the experimenter when located near a radio
station or immersed in thermal radiation at temperature T. The classical
physicists at the end of the 19th century chose the homogeneous boundary
conditions for Maxwell's equation based upon the experimental observations of
Lummer and Pringsheim which measured only the thermal radiation which exceeded
the random radiation surrounding their measuring equipment. Today at the
beginning of the 21st century, classical physicists must choose the homogeneous
boundary conditions for Maxell's equations to correspond to the full radiation
spectrum revealed by the recent Casimir force measurements which detect all the
radiation surrounding conducting parallel plates, including the radiation
absorbed and emitted by the plates themselves. The random classical radiation
spectrum revealed by the Casimir force measurements includes electromagnetic
zero-point radiation, which is missing from the spectrum measured by Lummer and
Pringsheim, and which cannot be eliminated by going to zero temperature. This
zero-point radiation will lead to zero-point energy for all systems which have
electromagnetic interactions. Thus the choice of the boundary conditions on the
homogeneous Maxwell equations is intimately related to the ideas of zero-point
energy and non-radiating ground states which are introduced in classes of
modern physics.

the case of point-like hadrons the well-known fit result $T = 154 \pm 2$ MeV is

an effective hard-core radius of 0.3 fm the $\chi^2$ temperature dependence of
the $\chi^2$ has a broad minimum in the temperature range of $155-210$ MeV,
with fit quality comparable to the $T \sim 155$ MeV minimum in the
point-particle case. Very similar result is obtained when only baryon-baryon
eigenvolume interactions are considered, with eigenvolume parameter taken from
previous fit to ground state of nuclear matter. Finally, when we apply the
eigenvolume corrections with mass-proportional eigenvolume $v_i \sim m_i$,
fixed to particular proton hard-core radius $r_p$, we observe a second minimum
in the temperature dependence of the $\chi^2$, located at the significantly
higher temperatures. For instance, at $r_p = 0.5$ fm the fit quality is better
than in the point-particle HRG case in a very wide temperature range of
$170-320$ MeV, which gives an uncertainty in the temperature determination from
the fit to the data of 150 MeV. These results show that thermal fits to the
heavy-ion hadron yield data are very sensitive to the modeling of the
short-range repulsion eigenvolume between hadrons, and that chemical freeze-out

model and three statistical based) were applied to investigate their
susceptibility to subtle noise caused by acquisition and reconstruction
deficiencies in computed tomography (CT) images. Features of lung tumours were
extracted from two different conventional and contrast enhanced CT image
data-sets under filtered and noisy conditions. When measuring the noise in the
background open-air region of the analysed CT images, noise of Gaussian and
Rayleigh distributions with varying mean and variance was encountered, and
Fisher distance was used to differentiate between an original extracted lung
tumour region of interest (ROI) with the filtered and noisy reconstructed
versions. It was determined that the wavelet packet (WP) and fractal dimension
measures were the least affected, while the Gaussian Markov random field,
run-length and co-occurrence matrices were the most affected by noise.
Depending on the selected ROI size, it was concluded that texture measures with
fewer extracted features can decrease susceptibility to noise, with the WP and
the Gabor filter having a stable performance in both filtered and noisy CT
versions and for both data-sets. Knowing how robust each texture measure under
noise presence is can assist physicians using an automated lung texture

obtain distinguished Hadamard two-point functions from asymptotic data.
Ultimately, we prove that the corresponding Quantum Field Theory on

designing complex systems, composed of many subsystems, rigorously and with
optimality guarantees. This paper introduces a theory of co-design that
describes ""design problems"", defined as tuples of ""functionality space"",
""implementation space"", and ""resources space"", together with a feasibility
relation that relates the three spaces. Design problems can be interconnected
together to create ""co-design problems"", which describe possibly recursive
co-design constraints among subsystems. A co-design problem induces a family of
optimization problems of the type ""find the minimal resources needed to
implement a given functionality""; the solution is an antichain (Pareto front)
of resources. A special class of co-design problems are Monotone Co-Design
Problems (MCDPs), for which functionality and resources are complete partial
orders and the feasibility relation is monotone and Scott continuous. The
induced optimization problems are multi-objective, nonconvex,
nondifferentiable, noncontinuous, and not even defined on continuous spaces;
yet, there exists a complete solution. The antichain of minimal resources can
be characterized as a least fixed point, and it can be computed using Kleene's
algorithm. The computation needed to solve a co-design problem can be bounded
by a function of a graph property that quantifies the interdependence of the
subproblems. These results make us much more optimistic about the problem of
designing complex systems in a rigorous way.

where the shape of the high end of the spectrum might unveil the presence of
nearby sources of acceleration. CALET has been designed to achieve a large
proton rejection capability (>10$^5$) with a fine grained imaging calorimeter
(IMC) followed by a total absorption calorimeter (TASC), for a total thickness
of 30 X$_{0}$ and 1.3 proton interaction length. With an excellent energy
resolution and a lower background contamination with respect to previous
experiments, CALET will search for possible spectral signatures of dark matter
with both electrons and gamma rays. CALET will also measure the high energy
spectra and relative abundance of cosmic nuclei from proton to iron and detect
trans-iron elements up to Z$\sim$40. The charge identification of individual
nuclear species is performed by a dedicated module (CHD) and by multiple dE/dx
measurements in the IMC. With a large exposure and high energy resolution,
CALET will be able to verify and complement the observations of CREAM, PAMELA
and AMS-02 on a possible deviation from a pure power-law of proton and He
spectra in the few hundred GeV region and to extend the study to the multi-TeV
region. CALET will also contribute to clarify the present experimental picture
on the energy dependence of the boron/carbon ratio, below and above 1 TeV/n,
thereby providing valuable information on cosmic-ray propagation in the galaxy.
Gamma-ray transients will be studied with a dedicated Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM).

This synthesis challenges the basic intuitions of both fields. In this thesis,
we show that adopting a unified and general language for process theories
advances foundations and practical applications of quantum information. Our
first set of results analyze quantum algorithms with a process theoretic
structure. We contribute new constructions of the Fourier transform and
Pontryagin duality in dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We then use this
setting to study generalized unitary oracles and give a new quantum blackbox
algorithm for the identification of group homomorphisms, solving the GROUPHOMID
problem. In the remaining section, we construct a novel model of quantum
blackbox algorithms in non-deterministic classical computation. Our second set
of results concerns quantum foundations. We complete work begun by Coecke et
al., definitively connecting the Mermin non-locality of a process theory with a
simple algebraic condition on that theory's phase groups. This result allows us
to offer new experimental tests for Mermin non-locality and new protocols for
quantum secret sharing. In our final chapter, we exploit the shared process
theoretic structure of quantum information and distributional compositional
linguistics. We propose a quantum algorithm adapted from Weibe et al. to
classify sentences by meaning. The clarity of the process theoretic setting
allows us to recover a speedup that is lost in the naive application of the
algorithm. The main mathematical tools used in this thesis are group theory
(esp. Fourier theory on finite groups), monoidal category theory, and
categorical algebra.

was consistent with the results of Spitzer/IRAC toward the lower Galactic

Compared to its better known complement, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS),
WAXS targets higher scattering angles and can enhance structural studies of
molecules by accessing finer details of solution structures. Although the
extension from SAXS to WAXS is easy to implement experimentally, the
computational tools required to fully harness the power of WAXS are still under
development. Currently, WAXS is employed to study structural changes and ligand
binding in proteins; however the methods are not as fully developed for nucleic

structures as well as the small but significant structural changes driven by
the addition of multivalent ions. We show the potential of WAXS to test

is governed by a Lindblad master equation, is a powerful technique in studies
of quantum phases of matter and quantum information. It can be used to drive a
quantum system to a desired (unique) steady state, which can be an exotic phase
of matter difficult to stabilize in nature. It can also be used to drive a
system to a unitarily-evolving subspace, which can be used to store, protect,
and process quantum information. In this paper, we derive a formula for the map
corresponding to asymptotic (infinite-time) Lindbladian evolution and use it to
study several important features of the unique state and subspace cases. We
quantify how subspaces retain information about initial states and show how to
use Lindbladians to simulate any quantum channels. We show that the quantum
information in all subspaces can be successfully manipulated by small
Hamiltonian perturbations, jump operator perturbations, or adiabatic
deformations. We provide a Lindblad-induced notion of distance between
adiabatically connected subspaces. We derive a Kubo formula governing linear
response of subspaces to time-dependent Hamiltonian perturbations and determine
cases in which this formula reduces to a Hamiltonian-based Kubo formula. As an
application, we show that (for gapped systems) the zero-frequency Hall
conductivity is unaffected by many types of Markovian dissipation. Finally, we
show that the energy scale governing leakage out of the subspaces, resulting
from either Hamiltonian/jump-operator perturbations or corrections to adiabatic
evolution, is different from the conventional Lindbladian dissipative gap and,
in certain cases, is equivalent to the excitation gap of a related Hamiltonian.

resources are limited, as seen in bacterial biofilms and multicellular

chemicals, as in quorum sensing, to achieve mutualism. Here, to achieve stable
division of labor, three properties are required. First, isogenous cells
differentiate into several types. Second, this aggregate of distinct cell types
shows better growth than that of isolated cells, by achieving division of
labor. Third, this cell aggregate is robust in the number distribution of
differentiated cell types. We here address how cells acquire the ability of
cell differentiation and division of labor simultaneously, which is also
connected with the robustness of a cell society. For this purpose, we developed
a dynamical-systems model of cells consisting of chemical components with
intracellular catalytic reaction dynamics. The reactions convert external
nutrients into internal components for cellular growth, and the divided cells
interact via chemical diffusion. We found that cells sharing an identical
catalytic network spontaneously differentiate via induction from cell-cell
interactions, and then achieve division of labor, enabling a higher growth rate
than that in the unicellular case. This symbiotic differentiation emerged for a
class of reaction networks with limited resources and strong cell-cell
interactions. Then, robustness in the cell type distribution was achieved,
while instability of collective growth could emerge even among the cooperative
cells when the internal reserves of products were dominant. The present
mechanism is simple and general as a natural result of interacting cells with
resource limitation, and is consistent with the observed behaviors and forms of
several aggregates of unicellular organisms.

a transversal is viewed from the perspective of being related to the everyday

one considers a transversal to be a light ray in air and the parallel lines to
form an occluding strip of a medium with the refractive index being between
that of air and water, then one should be able to account, both qualitatively
and quantitatively, for most of the features associated with the Poggendorff
illusion. Statistical treatment of the visual experiments conducted with 7
participants, each analysing 50 configurations having different intercepting
angles and strip widths, resulted in the effective refractive index of the
occluding strip N = 1.13 +/- 0.15, which is sufficiently close to the average
(between that of water and air) refractive index of ~ 1.17. It is further
argued that the same mechanism can also be employed to account for many

and reduces the power for testing hypothesis of no treatment effect on the

algorithm, the RSP can uniquely decompose any signal into a sum of exactly
periodic components, by selecting and removing the most dominant periodic
component from the residual signal in each iteration. In the RSP, a novel
periodicity metric is derived based on the energy of the exactly periodic
component obtained by orthogonally projecting the residual signal into the

component in each iteration. To reduce the computational cost of the RSP, we
also propose the fast RSP (FRSP) based on the relationship between the periodic

estimation of the energy of the periodic component in the periodic subspace.
The fast RSP has a lower computational cost and can decompose a signal of

photons. Remarkably, this newly discovered application of OAM states not only
reduces required physical resources but also increases feasible scale of
simulation. By showing how important topics such as edge-state transport and
topological phase transition can be studied in a small simulator with just a
few cavities ready for immediate experimental exploration, we demonstrate the
prospect of photonic OAM for quantum simulation which can have a significant
impact on the research of topological physics.

affects the ability of spanwise-forcing techniques to yield turbulent
skin-friction drag reduction. The considered forcing is based on the
streamwise-travelling waves of spanwise wall velocity (Quadrio {\em et al. J.
Fluid Mech.}, vol. 627, 2009, pp. 161--178). The study builds upon an extensive
drag-reduction database created with Direct Numerical Simulation of a turbulent
channel flow for two, 5-fold separated values of $Re$, namely $Re_\tau=200$ and
$Re_\tau=1000$. The sheer size of the database, which for the first time
systematically addresses the amplitude of the forcing, allows a comprehensive
view of the drag-reducing characteristics of the travelling waves, and enables
a detailed description of the changes occurring when $Re$ increases. The effect
of using a viscous scaling based on the friction velocity of either the
non-controlled flow or the drag-reduced flow is described. In analogy with
other wall-based drag reduction techniques, like for example riblets, the
performance of the travelling waves is well described by a vertical shift of
the logarithmic portion of the mean streamwise velocity profile. Except when
$Re$ is very low, this shift remains constant with $Re$, at odds with the
percentage reduction of the friction coefficient, which is known to present a
mild, logarithmic decline. Our new data agree with the available literature,
which is however mostly based on low-$Re$ information and hence predicts a
quick drop of maximum drag reduction with $Re$. The present study supports a
more optimistic scenario, where for an airplane at flight Reynolds numbers a
drag reduction of nearly 30\% would still be possible thanks to the travelling
waves.

develop two efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithms to solve our

phases of matter. For example, superconductors exhibit an amplitude Higgs mode
and a phase mode, which are the radial and angular excitations in the
Mexican-hat potential of the free energy. In two-band superconductors there
exists in addition a Leggett phase mode, which corresponds to collective
fluctuations of the interband phase difference. In equilibrium systems
amplitude and phase modes are decoupled, since they are mutually orthogonal
excitations. The direct detection of Higgs and Leggett modes by linear-response
measurements is challenging, because they are often overdamped and do not
couple directly to the electromagnetic field. In this work, using numerical
exact simulations we show for the case of two-gap superconductors, that optical
pump-probe experiments excite both Higgs and Leggett modes out of equilibrium.
We find that this non-adiabatic excitation process introduces a strong
interaction between the collective modes. Moreover, we predict that the coupled
Higgs and Leggett modes are clearly visible in the pump-probe absorption
spectra as oscillations at their respective frequencies.

broader class of cyber security metrics. However, risk is not the only possible
cyber security metric. Other metrics such as resilience can exist and could be
potentially very valuable to defenders of ICS systems. Often, metrics are
defined as measurable properties of a system that quantify the degree to which
objectives of the system are achieved. Metrics can provide cyber defenders of
an ICS with critical insights regarding the system. Metrics are generally
acquired by analyzing relevant attributes of that system. In terms of cyber
security metrics, ICSs tend to have unique features: in many cases, these
systems are older technologies that were designed for functionality rather than
security. They are also extremely diverse systems that have different
requirements and objectives. Therefore, metrics for ICSs must be tailored to a
diverse group of systems with many features and perform many different
functions. In this chapter, we first outline the general theory of performance
metrics, and highlight examples from the cyber security domain and ICS in
particular. We then focus on a particular example of a class of metrics that is
different from the one we have considered in earlier chapters. Instead of risk,
here we consider metrics of resilience. Resilience is defined by the National
Academy of Sciences (2012) as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb,
recover from, or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events.
This chapter presents two approaches for the generation of metrics based on the
concept of resilience using a matrix-based approach and a network-based
approach. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of different
methods is presented along with a process and tips intended to aid in devising
effective metrics.

result from fundamental redshifts, written 3K and 4K, that cause a shift of
absorbed beta and gamma lines of H to alpha gas line. Thus absorbed spectrum is
shifted until an absorbed line overlaps with Lyman alpha line of gas: redshift
only occurs if an alpha absorption pumps atoms to 2P state. Thus, space is
divided into spherical shells centered on the quasar, containing or not 2P
atoms. Neglecting collisional de-excitations in absorbing shells, more and more
atoms are excited until amplification of a beam having a long path in a shell,
thus perpendicular to the observed ray, is large enough for a superradiant
flash at alpha frequency. Energy is provided by atoms and observed ray,
absorbing a line at local Lyman alpha frequency. Redshifts of quasars spectra

landscape, and coherence for non-equilibrium quantum systems at steady state,
through exploring the energy and charge transport in molecular processes. The
curl quantum flux plays the key role in determining transport properties and
the system reaches equilibrium when flux vanishes. The novel curl quantum flux
reflects the degree of non-equilibriumness and the time-irreversibility. We
found an analytical expression for the quantum flux and its relationship to the
environmental pumping (non-equilibriumness quantified by the voltage away from
the equilibrium) and the quantum tunneling. Furthermore, we investigated
another quantum signature, the coherence, quantitatively measured by the
non-zero off diagonal element of the density matrix. Besides the
environment-assistance which can give dramatic enhancement of coherence and
quantum flux with high voltage at a fixed tunneling strength, the quantum flux
is promoted by the coherence in the regime of small tunneling while reduced by
the coherence in the regime of large tunneling, due to the non-monotonic
relationship between the coherence and tunneling. In view of the system as a
quantum heat engine, we studied the non-equilibrium thermodynamics and
established the analytical connections of curl quantum flux to the transport
quantities such as energy (charge) transfer efficiency, chemical reaction
efficiency, energy dissipation, heat and electric currents observed in the
experiments. We observed a perfect transfer efficiency in chemical reactions at
high voltage (chemical potential difference). Our theoretical predicted
behavior of the electric current with respect to the voltage is in good
agreements with the recent experiments on electron transfer in single
