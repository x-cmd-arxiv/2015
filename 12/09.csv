diameters downwind of the rotor) of a 2.5 MW wind turbine using snow-based
super-large-scale particle image velocimetery (SLPIV) (Hong et al., Nature
Comm., vol. 5, 2014, no. 4216) were successful in visualizing tip vortex cores
as areas devoid of snowflakes. The so-visualized snow voids, however, suggested
tip vortex cores of complex shape consisting of circular cores with distinct
elongated comet-like tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate
the structure and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified
experimentally. The LES is shown to reproduce vortex cores in good qualitative
agreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core
patterns observed in the field in the tip shear layer. We show that the
visualized vortex patterns are the result of energetic coherent dynamics in the
rotor tip shear layer driven by interactions between the tip vortices and a
second set of counter-rotating spiral vortices intertwined with the tip
vortices. We further show that the mean flow within the region where such rich
coherent dynamics occur satisfies the instability criterion proposed by
Leibovich and Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983, pp. 335--356),
indicating that the instability uncovered by the SLPIV and the LES is of
centrifugal type. This study highlights the feasibility of employing snow voids
to visualize tip vortices and demonstrates the enormous potential of
integrating SLPIV with LES as a powerful tool for gaining novel insights into
the wakes of utility scale wind turbines.

connection to the stability theory. This leads us to investigate the stability
and the strong semistability of the sheaf of relations on $\{x^2,y^2,z^2\}$

and hence that a photon's speed depends on its energy. We present further
numerical evidence for a scale dependent speed of light in the causal dynamical
triangulation (CDT) approach to quantum gravity. We show that the observed
scale dependent speed of light in CDT can be accounted for by a scale dependent
transformation of geodesic distance, whose specific functional form implies a
discrete equidistant area spectrum. We make two non-trivial tests of the
proposed scale transformation: a comparison with the leading order quantum
correction to the gravitational potential and a comparison with the generalised
uncertainty principle. In both cases, we obtain the same functional form.
However, contrary to the widespread prediction of vacuum dispersion in quantum
gravity, numerous experiments have now definitively ruled out linear vacuum
dispersion beyond Planckian energy scales, and have now even constrained
quadratic dispersion. Motivated by these experimental constraints we seek to
reconcile quantum gravity with the absence of vacuum dispersion. We point out
that given a scale dependent geodesic distance, a scale dependent time interval
becomes essential to maintaining an invariant speed of light. We show how a
particular scale dependent time interval allows a photon's speed to remain
independent of its energy.

particles from hot regions to cold ones. We rederive turbulent thermal

a bipolar magnetic region (BMR), and to investigate the role of these inflows

due to turbulent flows can be described as a diffusion process.
  Methods: We developed a simple surface flux transport model based on
point-like magnetic concentrations. We tracked the tilt angle, the magnetic
flux and the axial dipole moment of a BMR in simulations with and without
inflows and compared the results. To test the diffusion approximation,
simulations of random walk dispersal of magnetic features were compared against
the predictions of the diffusion treatment.
  Results: We confirm the validity of the diffusion approximation to describe
flux dispersal on large scales. We find that the inflows enhance flux
cancellation, but at the same time affect the latitudinal separation of the
polarities of the bipolar region. In most cases the latitudinal separation is
limited by the inflows, resulting in a reduction of the axial dipole moment of
the BMR. However, when the initial tilt angle of the BMR is small, the inflows
produce an increase in latitudinal separation that leads to an increase in the
axial dipole moment in spite of the enhanced flux destruction. This can give
rise to a tilt of the BMR even when the BMR was originally aligned parallel to
the equator.

Bang-bang Lyapunov control can speed up the control process, but cannot
guarantee convergence to a target state. This paper proposes two classes of new
Lyapunov control methods that can achieve rapidly convergent control for
quantum states. One class is switching Lyapunov control where the control law
is designed by switching between bang-bang Lyapunov control and standard

where we propose two special control functions which are continuously
differentiable and yet have a bang-bang type property. Related stability
results are given and a construction method for the degrees of freedom in the

simulation of non-overturning water waves, described by fully nonlinear
potential theory. The method can be viewed as a high-order extension of the
classical finite element method proposed by Cai et al (1998)
\cite{CaiEtAl1998}, although the numerical implementation differs greatly.
Features of the proposed spectral element method include: nodal Lagrange basis
functions, a general quadrature-free approach and gradient recovery using
global $L^2$ projections. The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov
form of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and
consequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves.
We show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of
over-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a
per element basis. This effectively removes any aliasing driven instabilities
while retaining the high-order accuracy of the numerical scheme. The additional
computational cost of the over-integration is found insignificant compared to
the cost of solving the Laplace problem. The model is applied to several
benchmark cases in two dimensions. The results confirm the high order accuracy
of the model (exponential convergence), and demonstrate the potential for
accuracy and speedup. The results of numerical experiments are in excellent
agreement with both analytical and experimental results for strongly nonlinear
and irregular dispersive wave propagation. The benefit of using a high-order --
possibly adapted -- spatial discretization for accurate water wave propagation
over long times and distances is particularly attractive for marine
hydrodynamics applications.

polyhedral constraints separately. This idea enables us to reduce the number of
iterations drastically when there are many linear inequality constraints. The
worst case number of iterations for FRA-poly is written in the terms of a
""distance to polyhedrality"" quantity and provides better bounds than FRA under
mild conditions. In particular, in the case of the doubly nonnegative cone,
FRA-Poly gives a worst case bound of $n$ whereas the classical FRA is
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Of possible independent interest, we prove a variant of
Gordan-Stiemke's Theorem and a proper separation theorem that takes into

AU. Here, we present 41 long-period planet candidates in 38 systems identified
by Planet Hunters based on Kepler archival data (Q0-Q17). Among them, 17
exhibit only one transit, 14 have two visible transits and 10 have more than
three visible transits. For planet candidates with only one visible transit, we
estimate their orbital periods based on transit duration and host star
properties. The majority of the planet candidates in this work (75%) have
orbital periods that correspond to distances of 1-3 AU from their host stars.
We conduct follow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations to validate and
characterize planet host stars. In total, we obtain adaptive optics images for
33 stars to search for possible blending sources. Six stars have stellar
companions within 4"". We obtain high-resolution spectra for 6 stars to
determine their physical properties. Stellar properties for other stars are
obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Kepler Stellar Catalog by
Huber et al. (2014). We validate 7 planet candidates that have planet
confidence over 0.997 (3-{\sigma} level). These validated planets include 3
single-transit planets (KIC-3558849b, KIC-5951458b, and KIC-8540376c), 3
planets with double transits (KIC-8540376b, KIC-9663113b, and KIC-10525077b),
and 1 planet with 4 transits (KIC-5437945b). This work provides assessment
regarding the existence of planets at wide separations and the associated false
positive rate for transiting observation (17%-33%). More than half of the
long-period planets with at least three transits in this paper exhibit transit
timing variations up to 41 hours, which suggest additional components that
dynamically interact with the transiting planet candidates. The nature of these
components can be determined by follow-up radial velocity and transit
observations.

multiphasic in a plot of k2 vs. pH. Data for the pseudo-first-order rate

bosons and fermions in the regime of negligibly weak interactions, a setting
which not only includes paradigmatic systems such as gases confined to boxes,
but also Luttinger liquids and the free superfluid Hubbard model. To do this,
we focus on two classes of measurements: (i) coarse-grained observables, such
as the number of particles in a region of space, and (ii) few-mode
measurements, such as phase correlators and correlation functions. We show
that, in this setting, equilibration occurs quite generally despite the fact
that the particles are not interacting. Furthermore, for coarse-grained
measurements the timescale is generally at most polynomial in the number of
particles N, which is much faster than previous general upper bounds, which
were exponential in N. For local measurements on lattice systems, the timescale
is typically linear in the number of lattice sites. In fact, for one
dimensional lattices, the scaling is generally linear in the length of the
lattice, which is optimal. Additionally, we look at a few specific examples,
one of which consists of N fermions initially confined on one side of a
partition in a box. The partition is removed and the fermions equilibrate
extremely quickly in time O(1/N).

optimizers do not exploit these subexpressions and produce sub-optimal plans.
The problem of multi-query optimization (MQO) is to generate an optimal
combined evaluation plan by computing common subexpressions once and reusing
them. Exhaustive algorithms for MQO explore an O(n^n) search space. Thus, this
problem has primarily been tackled using various heuristic algorithms, without
providing any theoretical guarantees on the quality of their solution. In this
paper, instead of the conventional cost minimization problem, we treat the
problem as maximizing a linear transformation of the cost function. We propose
a greedy algorithm for this transformed formulation of the problem, which under
weak, intuitive assumptions, provides an approximation factor guarantee for
this formulation. We go on to show that this factor is optimal, unless P = NP.
Another noteworthy point about our algorithm is that it can be easily
incorporated into existing transformation-based optimizers. We finally propose
optimizations which can be used to improve the efficiency of our algorithm.

methods for computing robustness measures from MCMC draws exist, they lack
generality and often require additional coding or computation.
  In contrast to MCMC, variational Bayes (VB) techniques are readily amenable
to robustness analysis. The derivative of a posterior expectation with respect
to a prior or data perturbation is a measure of local robustness to the prior
or likelihood. Because VB casts posterior inference as an optimization problem,
its methodology is built on the ability to calculate derivatives of posterior
quantities with respect to model parameters, even in very complex models. In
the present work, we develop local prior robustness measures for mean-field
variational Bayes(MFVB), a VB technique which imposes a particular
factorization assumption on the variational posterior approximation. We start
by outlining existing local prior measures of robustness. Next, we use these
results to derive closed-form measures of the sensitivity of mean-field
variational posterior approximation to prior specification. We demonstrate our
method on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled interventions in access to
microcredit in developing countries.

The horizontal vane radiometer is explored through experiment, kinetic theory,
and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The qualitative agreement
between the three methods of investigation is good expect for a dependence of
the force on the width of the vane even when the temperature gradient is
narrower than the vane which is present in the DSMC method results but not in

is better than an order of magnitude in the cases examined. The theory is
closer to the experimental values for narrow vanes and the simulations are
closer to the experimental values for the wide vanes. We find that the thermal
creep force acts from the hot side to the cold side of the vane. We also find
the peak in the radiometer's angular speed as a function of pressure is

protocols usually used in ad-hoc networks (e.g. OLSR and B.A.T.M.A.N.) and,
more recently, in the SDN paradigm (e.g. OpenWiMesh), each one of them having
its own pros and cons. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits and
impacts of each approach, taking into account models and metrics inherent to
the mobility. In this paper, we propose a simplified implementation of mobility
support in OpenWiMesh and evaluate its performance compared to other protocols,
using differents mobility and data traffic models. The chosen metrics are based
on packet loss, occupation of the links with control traffic and delay.

in ferromagnetic atomic contacts, we present here a combined experimental and
theoretical study of the conductance and shot noise of metallic atomic contacts
made of the 3d ferromagnetic materials Fe, Co, and Ni. For comparison, we also
present the corresponding results for the noble metal Cu. Conductance and shot
noise measurements, performed using a low-temperature break junction setup,
show that in these ferromagnetic nanowires: (i) there is no conductance
quantization of any kind, (ii) transport is dominated by several partially-open
conduction channels, even in the case of single-atom contacts, and (iii) the
Fano factor of large contacts saturates to values that clearly differs from
those of monovalent (nonmagnetic) metals. We rationalize these observations
with the help of a theoretical approach that combines molecular dynamics
simulations to describe the junction formation with nonequilibrium Green's
function techniques to compute the transport properties within the
Landauer-Buettiker framework. Our theoretical approach successfully reproduces
all the basic experimental results and it shows that all the observations can
be traced back to the fact that the d bands of the minority-spin electrons play
a fundamental role in the transport through ferromagnetic atomic-size contacts.
These d bands give rise to partially open conduction channels for any contact
size, which in turn lead naturally to the different observations described
above. Thus, the transport picture for these nanoscale ferromagnetic wires that
emerges from the ensemble of our results is clearly at variance with the well
established conduction mechanism that governs the transport in macroscopic
ferromagnetic wires, where the d bands are responsible for the magnetism but do
not take part in the charge flow.

the anatomical substrate of the brain is a central question in neuroscience. On
the one hand, modern neuroimaging technologies, such as diffusion tensor
imaging, can be used to construct structural graphs representing the
architecture of white matter streamlines linking cortical and subcortical
structures. On the other hand, temporal patterns of neural activity can be used
to construct functional graphs representing temporal correlations between brain
regions. Although some studies provide evidence that whole-brain functional
connectivity is shaped by the underlying anatomy, the observed relationship
between function and structure is weak, and the rules by which anatomy
constrains brain dynamics remain elusive. In this article, we introduce a
methodology to predict with high accuracy the functional connectivity of a
subject at rest from his or her structural graph. Using our methodology, we are
able to systematically unveil the role of structural paths in the formation of
functional correlations. Furthermore, in our empirical evaluations, we observe
that the eigen-modes of the predicted functional connectivity are aligned with
activity patterns associated with different cognitive systems. Our work offers
the potential to infer properties of brain dynamics in clinical or
developmental populations with low tolerance for functional neuroimaging.

perturbatively around a true minimum of the full quantum effective action,
which is to `complete normal order' the bare action of interest. When the true
vacuum of the theory is located at zero field value, the key property of this
prescription is the automatic cancellation, to any finite order in perturbation
theory, of all tadpole and, more generally, all `cephalopod' Feynman diagrams.
The latter are connected diagrams that can be disconnected into two pieces by
cutting one internal vertex, with either one or both pieces free from external
lines. In addition, this procedure of `complete normal ordering' (which is an
extension of the standard field theory definition of normal ordering) reduces
by a substantial factor the number of Feynman diagrams to be calculated at any
given loop order. We illustrate explicitly the complete normal ordering
procedure and the cancellation of cephalopod diagrams in scalar field theories
with non-derivative interactions, and by using a point splitting `trick' we
extend this result to theories with derivative interactions, such as those
appearing as non-linear sigma-models in the world-sheet formulation of string
theory. We focus here on theories with trivial vacua, generalising the
discussion to non-trivial vacua in a follow-up paper.

of the common ions found in normal SNe Ia in agreement with previous studies.
  We show that 2014J is a relatively normal SN Ia. At early times the spectral

maximum light with the appearance of Na I and Mg I. At later times iron-group

would imply significant mixing of unburned or only slight processed elements

characteristics are affected by the underlying temperature and magnetic field
strength. We study the problem of a warm wind running into a cold ambient
toroid by using a tracer field that keeps track of the wind material. While an
isothermal equation of state is adopted, the effective temperature is
determined locally based on the wind mass fraction. In the unified wind model,
the density of the wind is cylindrically stratified and highly concentrated
toward the outflow axis. Our simulations show that for a sufficiently
magnetized wind, the jet identity can be well maintained even at high
temperatures. However, for a high temperature wind with low magnetization, the
thermal pressure of the wind gas can drive material away from the axis, making
the jet less collimated as it propagates. We also study the role of the
poloidal magnetic field of the toroid. It is shown that the wind-ambient
interface becomes more resistant to corrugation when the poloidal field is
present, and the poloidal field that bunches up within the toroid prevents the
swept-up material from being compressed into a thin layer. This suggests that
the ambient poloidal field may play a role in producing a smoother and thicker
swept-up shell structure in the molecular outflow.

and evanescent electron states coexist inherently in this material, giving rise
to these exotic properties. In this sense, bilayer graphene is unique, since in
most material systems in which Fano resonance phenomena are manifested an
external source that provides extended states is required. However, from a
numerical standpoint, the presence of evanescent-divergent states in the
eigenfunctions linear superposition representing the Dirac spinors, leads to a
numerical degradation (the so called $\Omega$d problem) in the practical
applications of the standard Coefficient Transfer Matrix ($K$) method used to
study charge transport properties in Bilayer Graphen based multi-barrier
systems. We present here a straightforward procedure based in the hybrid
compliance-stiffness matrix method ($H$) that can overcome this numerical

proposed $H$ method is suitable to study the transmission and transport
properties of electrons in GBG superlattice since it remains numerically stable

history or molecule formation pathways. Whereas a large number of observations
is available regarding interstellar deuterated stable molecules, relatively
little is known about the deuteration of hydride radicals, as their fundamental
rotational transitions are at high frequencies where the atmosphere is mostly
opaque. Nitrogen hydride radicals are important species in nitrogen chemistry,
as they are thought to be related to ammonia formation. Observations have shown
that ammonia is strongly deuterated, with [NH2D]/[NH3] ~ 10%. Models predict
similarly high [ND]/[NH] ratios, but so far only one observational
determination of this ratio is available, towards the envelope of the protostar
IRAS16293-2422. In order to test model predictions, we aim here at determining
[ND]/[NH] in a dense, starless core. We observed NH and ND in 16293E with the
HIFI spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the CHESS
guaranteed time key programme, and derived the abundances of these two species
using a non-LTE non-local radiative transfer model. Both NH and ND are detected
in the source, with ND in emission and NH in absorption against the continuum
arising from the cold dust emission. Our model shows however that the ND
emission and the NH absorption originate from different layers in the cloud, as
further evidenced by their different velocities. In the central region of the
core, we can set a lower limit to the [ND]/[NH] ratio of ~2%. This estimate is
consistent with recent pure gas-phase models of nitrogen chemistry

their SFR. We discuss how these ""excesses"" may be due to low metallicities and
high interaction levels. For elliptical and S0 galaxies, after accounting for
AGNs and nuclear sources, most CG galaxies are consistent with the Boroson et
al. (2011) $L_X$ - stellar mass correlation for low-mass XRBs, with larger
scatter, likely due to residual effects such as AGN activity or hot gas.
Assuming non-nuclear sources are low- or high-mass XRBs, we use appropriate XRB
luminosity functions to estimate the probability that stochastic effects can
lead to such extreme $L_X$ values. We find that, although stochastic effects do
not in general appear to be important, for some galaxies there is a significant
probability that high $L_X$ values can be observed due to strong XRB

of a system is specified by the time-evolving properties of the Lagrangian
particles that define it at z=0. We find a strong correlation between the
evolution of the specific angular momentum of today's stars (cold gas) and that
of the inner (whole) dark matter halo they are associated with. This link is
particularly strong for the stars formed before the epoch of maximum expansion
and subsequent collapse of the central dark matter halo (turnaround). Spheroids
are typically assembled primarily from stars formed prior to turnaround, and
are therefore destined to suffer a net loss of angular momentum associated with
the strong merging activity during the assembly of the inner dark matter halo.
Stellar discs retain their specific angular momentum since they are comprised
of stars formed mainly after turnaround, from gas that mostly preserves the
high specific angular momentum it acquired by tidal torques during the linear
growth of the halo. Since the specific angular momentum loss of the stars is
tied to the galaxy's morphology today, it may be possible to use our results to
predict, statistically, the assembly history of a halo given the morphology of
the galaxy it hosts.

general relativity in spacetime dimension $d\ge4$. Our approach is an
adaptation of the general framework of Hollands and Wald, which gives a
stability criterion in terms of the sign of the canonical energy,
$\mathcal{E}$. The general framework was originally formulated for static or
stationary and axisymmetric black holes in the asymptotically flat case, and
the stability analysis for that case applies only to axisymmetric
perturbations. However, in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter case, the
stability analysis requires only that the black hole have a single Killing
field normal to the horizon and there are no restrictions on the perturbations
(apart from smoothness and appropriate behavior at infinity). For an
asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole, we define an ergoregion to be a
region where the horizon Killing field is spacelike; such a region, if present,
would normally occur near infinity. We show that for black holes with
ergoregions, initial data can be constructed such that $\mathcal{E}<0$, so all
such black holes are unstable. To obtain such initial data, we first construct
an approximate solution to the constraint equations using the WKB method, and
then we use the Corvino-Schoen technique to obtain an exact solution. We also
discuss the case of charged asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes with
generalized ergoregions.

coordinates as proposed by Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke [arXiv:1006.0146].
However, we need to refine the expansion by including additional novel monopole
bubbling contributions to obtain a precise match. Using D-brane realization of
these singular BPS line operators, we derive and incorporate the monopole
bubbling contributions as well as predict the degeneracies of framed BPS states
contributing to the line operator vevs in the limit of vanishing simultaneous
spatial and R-symmetry rotation fugacity parameter.

Fermi-arc contributions to surface quasiparticle interference. Using a general

breaking without the need of new particles carrying the standard model gauge
charges below a few TeV. In the low energy theory, the only probe comes from
the mixing of the Higgs fields in the standard model and twin sectors. However,
an ultraviolet completion is required below ~ 10 TeV to remove residual
logarithmic divergences. In non-supersymmetric completions, new exotic fermions
charged under both the standard model and twin gauge symmetries have to be
present to accompany the top quark, thus providing a high energy probe of the
model. Some of them carry standard model color, and may therefore be copiously
produced at current or future hadron colliders. Once produced, these exotic
quarks can decay into a top together with twin sector particles. If the twin
sector particles escape the detection, we have the irreducible stop-like
signals. On the other hand, some twin sector particles may decay back into the
standard model particles with long lifetimes, giving spectacular displaced
vertex signals in combination with the prompt top quarks. This happens in the
Fraternal Twin Higgs scenario with typical parameters, and sometimes is even
necessary for cosmological reasons. We study the potential displaced vertex
signals from the decays of the twin bottomonia, twin glueballs, and twin
leptons in the Fraternal Twin Higgs scenario. Depending on the details of the
twin sector, the exotic quarks may be probed up to ~ 2.5 TeV at the LHC and
beyond 10 TeV at a future 100 TeV collider, providing a strong test of this

serendipitous to the original goal of the observations. We report the discovery
of previously unknown continuum sources, or a single fast moving new source, in
our ALMA observations. Here we aim to determine the nature of the detections.
The detections, at $>5.8\sigma$ in the image plane and $>14\sigma$ in the
$(u,v)-$plane, were made in two epochs of ALMA observations of a $25$ arc
second region around the asymptotic giant branch star W Aql in the continuum
around 345 GHz. At a third epoch, covering $50x50$ arcseconds, the source(s)
were not seen. We have investigated if the detections could be spurious, if
they could constitute a population of variable background sources, or if the
observations revealed a fast moving single object. Based on our analysis, we
conclude that a single object (with a flux of $\sim3.0$ mJy) exhibiting a large
proper motion ($\sim87$ arcsec/yr) is the most likely explanation. Until the
nature of the source becomes clear, we have named it Gna. Unless there are yet
unknown, but significant, issues with ALMA observations, we have detected a
previously unknown objects in our solar system. Based on proper motion analysis
we find that, if it is gravitationally bound, Gna is currently located at
$12-25$ AU distance and has a size of $\sim220-880$ km. Alternatively it is a
much larger, planet-sized, object, gravitationally unbound, and located within
$\sim4000$ AU, or beyond (out to $\sim0.3$~pc) if it is strongly variable. Our
observations highlight the power of ALMA in detecting possible solar system
objects, but also show how multiple epoch observations are crucial to identify

been proposed to head-start black hole growth from initial seeds with masses
$\sim 10^5\,\rm M_\odot$, which can then reach a billion solar mass while
accreting at the Eddington limit. Here we propose an alternative scenario based
on radiatively inefficient super-critical accretion of stellar-mass holes
embedded in the gaseous circum-nuclear discs (CNDs) expected to exist in the
cores of high redshift galaxies. Our sub-pc resolution hydrodynamical
simulations show that stellar-mass holes orbiting within the central 100 pc of
the CND bind to very high density gas clumps that arise from the fragmentation
of the surrounding gas. Owing to the large reservoir of dense cold gas
available, a stellar-mass black hole allowed to grow at super-Eddington rates
according to the ""slim disc"" solution can increase its mass by 3 orders of
magnitudes within a few million years. These findings are supported by
simulations run with two different hydro codes, RAMSES based on the Adaptive
Mesh Refinement technique and GIZMO based on a new Lagrangian Godunov-type
method, and with similar, but not identical, sub-grid recipes for star
formation, supernova feedback, black hole accretion and feedback. The low
radiative efficiency of super-critical accretion flows are instrumental to the
rapid mass growth of our black holes, as they imply modest radiative heating of
the surrounding nuclear environment.

Chandra-observed nearby highly inclined disk galaxies. We first measure the
star forming galactic disk sizes, as well as the SFRs of these galaxies, using
data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, and then show that 1) the
specific 0.5-2~keV luminosity of the coronal emission correlates with the
specific SFR in a {\sl sub-linear} fashion: on average, $L_X/L_K \propto
(SFR/M_*)^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma =0.29\pm0.12$; 2) the efficiency of the
emission $ L_X/SFR$ decreases with increasing surface SFR ($I_{SFR}$; $\Gamma =
-0.44\pm0.12$); and 3) the characteristic temperature of the X-ray-emitting
plasma weakly correlates with $I_{SFR}$ ($\Gamma = 0.08\pm0.04$). These
results, somewhat surprising and anti-intuitive, suggest that a) the linear
correlation between $L_X$ and SFR, as commonly presented, is largely due to the
correlation of these two parameters with galaxy mass; b) much of the mechanical
energy from stellar feedback likely drives global outflows with little X-ray
cooling and with a mass-loading efficiency decreasing fast with increasing
$I_{SFR}$ ($\Gamma \lesssim -0.5$); c) these outflows heat and inflate the
medium around the galactic disks of massive galaxies, reducing its radiative
cooling rate, whereas for relatively low-mass galaxies, the energy in the
outflows is probably dissipated in regions far away from the galactic disks.

populations that can be separated with an additional J - H color. The
populations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z > 3 (JH-blue) and
extremely dusty galaxies at z < 3 (JH-red). The 350 arcmin^2 of the GOODS-N and
GOODS-S fields with the deepest HST/WFC3 and IRAC data contain 285 HIEROs down
to [4.5] < 24 mag. We focus here primarily on JH-blue (z > 3) HIEROs, which
have a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massM_{*}~10^{10.6} Msun,
and are much fainter in the rest-frame UV than similarly massive Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs). Their star formation rates (SFRs) reaches ~240 Msun yr^{-1}
leading to a specific SFR, sSFR ~4.2 Gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the sSFRs for
massive galaxies continue to grow at z > 2 but at a lower growth rate than from
z=0 to z=2. With a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compact
as quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, JH-blue HIEROs represent perfect
star-forming progenitors of the most massive (M_{*} > 10^{11.2} Msun) compact
quiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. HIEROs make up
~60% of all galaxies with M_{*} > 10^{10.5} Msun identified at z > 3 from their
photometric redshifts. This is five times more than LBGs with nearly no overlap
between the two populations. While HIEROs make up 15-25% of the total SFR
density at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the SFR density taking place in
M_{*} >10^{10.5} Msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding the

the behaviour of the scalar field on the horizon of the black hole. We carry

constant near the singularity plus additional regular terms. When the perturbed
exotic field is associated with $\al>0$ the perturbed pressure and contrast

perturbed pressure can remain bounded. In addition, the perturbed exotic field

against noise. In large-scale systems there are several types of noise that can
affect the performance of distributed machine learning algorithms -- straggler
nodes, system failures, or communication bottlenecks -- but there has been
little interaction cutting across codes, machine learning, and distributed
systems. In this work, we provide theoretical insights on how coded solutions
can achieve significant gains compared to uncoded ones. We focus on two of the
most basic building blocks of distributed learning algorithms: matrix
multiplication and data shuffling. For matrix multiplication, we use codes to
alleviate the effect of stragglers, and show that if the number of homogeneous
workers is $n$, and the runtime of each subtask has an exponential tail, coded
computation can speed up distributed matrix multiplication by a factor of $\log
n$. For data shuffling, we use codes to reduce communication bottlenecks,
exploiting the excess in storage. We show that when a constant fraction
$\alpha$ of the data matrix can be cached at each worker, and $n$ is the number
of workers, \emph{coded shuffling} reduces the communication cost by a factor
of $(\alpha + \frac{1}{n})\gamma(n)$ compared to uncoded shuffling, where
$\gamma(n)$ is the ratio of the cost of unicasting $n$ messages to $n$ users to
multicasting a common message (of the same size) to $n$ users. For instance,
$\gamma(n) \simeq n$ if multicasting a message to $n$ users is as cheap as
unicasting a message to one user. We also provide experiment results,
corroborating our theoretical gains of the coded algorithms.

Using
simulations of the same initial conditions but with two different feedback
schemes (MUGS and MaGICC), we examine the features of the age-metallicity
relation (AMR), and the three-dimensional age-metallicity-[O/Fe] distribution,
both for the galaxy as a whole and decomposed into disc, bulge, halo, and
satellites. The MUGS simulation, which uses traditional supernova feedback, is
replete with chemical substructure. This sub- structure is absent from the
MaGICC simulation, which includes early feedback from stellar winds, a modified
IMF and more efficient feedback. The reduced amount of substructure is due to
the almost complete lack of satellites in MaGICC. We identify a significant
separation between the bulge and disc AMRs, where the bulge is considerably
more metal-rich with a smaller spread in metallicity at any given time than the
disc. Our results suggest, however, that identifying the substructure in
observations will require exquisite age resolution, on the order of 0.25 Gyr.
Certain satellites show exotic features in the AMR, even forming a 'sawtooth'
shape of increasing metallicity followed by sharp declines which correspond to
pericentric passages. This fact, along with the large spread in stellar age at
a given metallicity, compromises the use of metallicity as an age indicator,
although alpha abundance provides a more robust clock at early times. This may
also impact algorithms that are used to reconstruct star formation histories
from resolved stellar populations, which frequently assume a
monotonically-increasing AMR.

which lie in the so-called clockwise disk, while the remaining 80% do not
belong to any disks. The circumnuclear ring (CNR), a ring of molecular gas that
orbits the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of 1.5 pc, has been
claimed to induce precession and Kozai-Lidov oscillations onto the orbits of
stars in the innermost parsec. We investigate the perturbations exerted by a
gas ring on a nearly-Keplerian stellar disk orbiting a SMBH by means of
combined direct N-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We
simulate the formation of gas rings through the infall and disruption of a
molecular gas cloud, adopting different inclinations between the infalling gas
cloud and the stellar disk. We find that a CNR-like ring is not efficient in
affecting the stellar disk on a timescale of 3 Myr. In contrast, a gas ring in
the innermost 0.5 pc induces precession of the longitude of the ascending node
Omega, significantly affecting the stellar disk inclination. Furthermore, the
combined effect of two-body relaxation and Omega-precession drives the stellar
disk dismembering, displacing the stars from the disk. The impact of precession
on the star orbits is stronger when the stellar disk and the inner gas ring are
nearly coplanar. We speculate that the warm gas in the inner cavity might have
played a major role in the evolution of the clockwise disk.

also provide a combinatorial characterisation that is sufficient to ensure
flux-concentration duality. That is, for every two disjoint sets of molecular
species, there is at least one reaction complex that involves species from only
one of the two sets. When unidirectional fluxes and molecular species
concentrations are dual vectors, this implies that the behaviour of the

Explanations vary from assuming it is just a > 3 sigma primordial Gaussian
fluctuation to the imprint of a supervoid via the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe and
Rees-Sciama (ISW+RS) effects. Since single spherical supervoids cannot account
for the full profile, the ISW+RS of multiple line-of-sight voids is studied
here to mimic the structure of the cosmic web. Two structure configurations are
considered. The first, through simulations of 20 voids, produces a central mean
temperature of ~-50 mu K. In this model the central CS temperature lies at ~ 2
sigma but fails to explain the CS hot ring. An alternative multi-void model
(using more pronounced compensated voids) produces much smaller temperature
profiles, but contains a prominent hot ring. Arrangements containing closely
placed voids at low redshift are found to be particularly well suited to
produce CS-like profiles. We then measure the significance of the CS if CS-like
profiles (which are fitted to the ISW+RS of multi-void scenarios) are removed.
The CS tension with the LCDM model can be reduced dramatically for an array of
temperature profiles smaller than the CS itself.

Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope to search for
transient radio sources in the field around the intermittent pulsar PSR
J1107-5907. The pulsar is thought to switch between an ""off"" state in which no
emission is detectable, a weak state and a strong state. We ran three
independent transient detection pipelines on two-minute snapshot images from a
13 hour BETA observation in order to 1) study the emission from the pulsar, 2)
search for other transient emission from elsewhere in the image and 3) to
compare the results from the different transient detection pipelines. The
pulsar was easily detected as a transient source and, over the course of the
observations, it switched into the strong state three times giving a typical
timescale between the strong emission states of 3.7 hours. After the first
switch it remained in the strong state for almost 40 minutes. The other strong
states lasted less than 4 minutes. The second state change was confirmed using
observations with the Parkes radio telescope. No other transient events were
found and we place constraints on the surface density of such events on these
timescales. The high sensitivity Parkes observations enabled us to detect
individual bright pulses during the weak state and to study the strong state
over a wide observing band. We conclude by showing that future transient
surveys with ASKAP will have the potential to probe the intermittent pulsar
population.

intrinsic width $\frac{1}{M}$ is an effective field theory of the long distance
quark-antiquark interaction in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory. Long wavelength
fluctuations of the $Z_N$ vortices of this theory lead to an effective string
theory. In this paper we clarify the connection between effective field theory
and effective string theory and we propose a new constraint on these vortices.
We first examine the impact of string fluctuations on the classical dual
superconductor description of confinement. At inter-quark distances $R\sim
\frac{1}{M}$ the classical action for a straight flux tube determines the heavy
quark potentials. At distances $R \gg \frac{1}{M}$ fluctuations of the flux
tube axis $\tilde{x}$ give rise to an effective string theory with an action
$S_{eff} (\tilde{x})$, the classical action for a curved flux tube, evaluated
in the limit $\frac{1}{M} \rightarrow 0~$. This action is equal to the
Nambu-Goto action. These conclusions are independent of the details of the
$Z_N$ flux tube. Further, we assume the QCD flux tube satisfies the additional
constraint: $$\int_0^\infty r dr \frac{T_{\theta \theta} (r)}{r^2} =0,$$ where
$\frac{T_{\theta \theta}(r)}{r^2}$ is the value of the $\theta\theta$ component
of the stress tensor at a distance $r$ from the axis of an infinite flux tube.
Under this constraint the string tension $\sigma$ equals the force on a quark
in the chromoelectric field $\vec{E}$ of an infinite straight flux tube, and
the Nambu-Goto action can be represented in terms of the chromodynamic fields
of effective magnetic $SU(N)$ gauge theory, yielding a field theory
interpretation of effective string theory.

HST/WFC3 in two bands and with two spacecraft roll angles. Using point spread

light curve, the secondary shows modulations that are clearly detected in the
combined light curve as well as in different subsets of the data. The

By fitting sine waves to the light curves, we find a consistent period of
$10.7^{+1.2}_{-0.6}$ hours and similar phases in both bands. The J- and H-band
amplitude ratio of 2M1207b is very similar to a field brown dwarf that has

stratospheric temperature and composition are affected by this latitudinally
varying insolation along the seasons. The thermal structure is controlled and
regulated by the amount of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere, which act as
absorbers and coolants from the UV to the far-IR spectral range, and this
structure influences the amount of hydrocarbons. We study here the feedback
between the chemical composition and the thermal structure by coupling a
latitudinal and seasonal photochemical model with a radiative seasonal model.
Our results show that the seasonal temperature peak in the higher stratosphere,
associated with the seasonal increase of insolation, is shifted earlier than
the maximum insolation peak. This shift is increased with increasing latitudes
and is caused by the low amount of stratospheric coolants in the spring season.
At 80$^{\circ}$ in both hemispheres, the temperature peak at 1d-2mbar is seen
to occur half a season earlier than was previously predicted by radiative
seasonal models that assumed spatially and temporally uniform distribution of
coolants. This shift progressively decreases with increasing pressure, up to
around the 0.5mbar pressure level where it vanishes. However, the thermal field
has a small feedback on the abundance distributions. This feedback modifies the
predicted equator-to-pole temperature gradient. The meridional gradients of
temperature at the mbar pressure levels are better reproduced when this
feedback is accounted for. At lower pressure levels, the thermal structure
seems to depart from pure radiative seasonal equilibrium as previously
suggested by Guerlet et al. (2014). Although the agreement with the absolute
value of the stratospheric temperature observed by Cassini is moderate, it is a
mandatory step toward a fully coupled GCM-photochemical model.

interference processes as the Fano effect and, since such a mechanism is
unbalanced, these states decay as regular into the continuum. Such fingerprints
identify BICs in graphene as we have discussed in detail in Phys. Rev. B 92,
245107 and 045409 (2015). Here by considering two semi-infinite Kitaev chains
within the topological phase, coupled to a quantum dot (QD) hybridized with
leads, we show the emergence of a novel type of BICs, in which MQPs are
trapped. As the MQPs of these chains far apart build a delocalized fermion and
qubit, we identify that the decay of these BICs is not connected to Fano and it
occurs when finite fluctuations are observed in the vacuum composed by electron
pairs for this qubit. From the experimental point of view, we also show that
vacuum fluctuations can be induced just by changing the chain-dot couplings
from symmetric to asymmetric. Hence, we show how to perform the qubit storage
within two delocalized BICs of MQPs and to access it when the vacuum fluctuates
by means of a complete controllable way in quantum transport experiments.

graph optimization problems, e.g., in some cases, a big graph can be chopped
into pieces that fit on one machine to be processed independently before
stitching the results together. In other cases, links between different parts
may show up in the running time and/or network communications cost. We study a
distributed balanced partitioning problem where the goal is to partition the
vertices of a given graph into k pieces so as to minimize the total cut size.
Our algorithm is composed of a few steps that are easily implementable in
distributed computation frameworks. The algorithm first embeds nodes of the
graph onto a line, and then processes nodes in a distributed manner guided by
the linear embedding order. We examine various ways to find the first
embedding, e.g., via a hierarchical clustering or Hilbert curves. Then we apply
four different techniques including local swaps, minimum cuts on the boundaries
of partitions, as well as contraction and dynamic programming. As our empirical
study, we compare the above techniques with each other, and also to previous
work in distributed graph algorithms, e.g., a label propagation method, FENNEL
and Spinner. We report our results both on a private map graph and several
public social networks, and show that our results beat previous distributed
algorithms: e.g., compared to the label propagation algorithm, we report an
improvement of 15-25% in the cut value. We also observe that our algorithms
allow for scalable distributed implementation for any number of partitions.
Finally, we apply our techniques for the Google Maps Driving Directions to
minimize the number of multi-shard queries with the goal of saving in CPU
usage. During live experiments, we observe an ~40% drop in the number of
multi-shard queries when comparing our method with a standard geography-based

important as it is associated with the collapse of the jet and with the

high state: VHS) are complex, with soft but distinctly non-thermal
Comptonisation which merges smoothly into the disc emission. Here we develop a
physical model for the accretion flow which can accommodate all these features,
with an outer standard disc, which can make a transition to an energetically
coupled disc-corona region, and make a further transition to a hot inner flow
which can be radiatively inefficient if required. The code explicitly uses
fully relativistic emissivity (Novikov-Thorne), and all Comptonisation is
calculated with a hybrid (thermal and non-thermal) electron distribution. We
fit this to a VHS spectrum from GX 339-4. We show that the complex continuum
curvature produced by a hybrid electron distribution is enough to remove the
strong constraint on black hole spin derived from reflection using simpler
Comptonisation models. More fundamentally, we show that the VHS cannot be fit
with the same Novikov-Thorne emissivity which can fit the disc dominated
spectrum but instead requires that the inner flow is somewhat radiatively
inefficient. This is consistent with an accretion powered jet, but simultaneous
radio data show that the jet has already collapsed at the time of our data.
Instead, it could point to truncation of the inner flow at radii larger than
the innermost stable circular orbit, as predicted by the Lense-Thirring QPO
models.

technique to design schedules for algorithms with no non-trivial dependencies,
focusing on the classical matrix multiplication algorithm.
  We model the symmetry of algorithm with the set of instructions $X$ as the
action of the group formed by the compositions of bijections from the set $X$
to itself. We model the machine as the action of the group $N\times \Delta$,
where $N$ and $\Delta$ represent the interconnect topology and time increments
respectively, on the set $P\times T$ of processors iterated over time steps. We
model schedules as symmetry-preserving equivariant maps between the set $X$ and
a subgroup of its symmetry and the set $P\times T$ with the symmetry
$N\times\Delta$. Such equivariant maps are the solutions of a set of algebraic
equations involving group homomorphisms. We associate time and communication
costs with the solutions to these equations.
  We solve these equations for the classical matrix multiplication algorithm
and show that equivariant maps correspond to time- and communication-efficient
schedules for many topologies. We recover well known variants including the
Cannon's algorithm and the communication-avoiding ""2.5D"" algorithm for toroidal
interconnects, systolic computation for planar hexagonal VLSI arrays, recursive
algorithms for fat-trees, the cache-oblivious algorithm for the ideal cache
model, and the space-bounded schedule for the parallel memory hierarchy model.

motivated by solutions to algebraic equations.

the approach to equilibrium in biological systems. The replicator equation,
evolutionary game theory, Markov processes and chemical reaction networks all
describe the dynamics of a population or probability distribution. Under
suitable assumptions, the distribution will approach an equilibrium with the
passage of time. Relative entropy - that is, the Kullback--Leibler divergence,
or various generalizations of this - provides a quantitative measure of how far
from equilibrium the system is. We explain various theorems that give
conditions under which relative entropy is nonincreasing. In biochemical
applications these results can be seen as versions of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics, stating that free energy can never increase with the passage of
time. In ecological applications, they make precise the notion that a
population gains information from its environment as it approaches equilibrium.

such as computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition. Accompanied
with those applications, significant research has studied the theoretical
limits and algorithm design for convex relaxations in sparse modeling. However,
theoretical analyses on non-negative versions of sparse modeling are limited in
the literature either to a noiseless setting or a scenario with a specific
statistical noise model such as Gaussian noise. This paper studies the
performance of non-negative sparse modeling in a more general scenario where
the observed signals have an unknown arbitrary distortion, especially focusing
on non-negativity constrained and L1-penalized least squares, and gives an
exact bound for which this problem can recover the correct signal elements. We
pose two conditions to guarantee the correct signal recovery: minimum
coefficient condition (MCC) and nonlinearity vs. subset coherence condition
(NSCC). The former defines the minimum weight for each of the correct atoms
present in the signal and the latter defines the tolerable deviation from the
linear model relative to the positive subset coherence (PSC), a novel type of
""coherence"" metric. We provide rigorous performance guarantees based on these
conditions and experimentally verify their precise predictive power in a
hyperspectral data unmixing application.

requires visual manipulation by retaining the most important structures of

methods can overcome the above problem, but they either require complicated

adaption flexibility to different tasks, or cannot obtain explicit structures

learn a spanning tree or a weighted undirected $\ell_1$ graph are proposed, and
a new learning algorithm is developed that learns a set of principal points and
a graph structure from data, simultaneously. The new algorithm is simple with
guaranteed convergence. We then extend the proposed framework to deal with
large-scale data. Experimental results on various synthetic and six real world
datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably with baselines and
can uncover the underlying structure correctly.

agencies to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links for preventing
intended crimes and terror attacks. In this paper, we propose a new wireless
information surveillance paradigm by investigating a scenario where a
legitimate monitor aims to intercept a suspicious wireless communication link
over fading channels. The legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop
(decode) the information of the suspicious link at each fading state only when
its achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. In
practice, such legitimate eavesdropping is particularly challenging, since the
legitimate monitor may be far away from the suspicious transmitter and cannot
eavesdrop efficiently. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach,
namely proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate
monitor purposely jams the receiver so as to change the suspicious
communication (e.g., to a smaller data rate) for overhearing more efficiently.
In particular, we consider delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant applications for
the suspicious data communications, under which the legitimate monitor
maximizes the eavesdropping non-outage probability for event-based monitoring
and the relative eavesdropping rate for content analysis, respectively, by
optimizing its jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to
an average power constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive
eavesdropping via cognitive jamming approach greatly outperforms the
conventional passive eavesdropping without jamming and the proactive
eavesdropping with constant-power jamming.

over two nested linear regression models. We prove that the MATA for any
reasonable weight function belongs to the class of confidence intervals defined
by Kabaila and Giri, JSPI, 2009. Each confidence interval in this class is
specified by two functions b and s. Kabaila and Giri show how to compute these
functions so as to optimize these intervals in terms of satisfying the coverage
constraint and minimizing the expected length for the simpler model, while
ensuring that the expected length has desirable properties for the full model.
These Kabaila and Giri ""optimized"" intervals provide an upper bound on the
performance of the MATA for an arbitrary weight function. This fact is used to
evaluate the MATA for a broad class of weights based on exponentiating a
criterion related to Mallows' C_P. Our results show that, while far from ideal,
this MATA performs surprisingly well, provided that we choose a member of this
class that does not put too much weight on the simpler model.

electromagnetic interaction that generates the Aharonov-Bohm effect. For this
purpose, we derive an interaction Lagrangian based on the local action of
gauge-invariant quantities only, and compare it with the standard
potential-based (""nonlocal"") Lagrangian. It is shown that the two models
provide identical results for any phenomena involving classical equations of
motion or topological quantum phases. Interestingly, we find an example
violating this equivalence, that is, the interference of single charges
coproduced from two independent sources. Whereas a well-defined phase shift of
the interference is predicted in the ""local"" model, the standard nonlocal
Lagrangian does not provide a gauge-invariant phase shift. This implies that an
observation of the interference in the proposed setup can rule out the
gauge-dependent potential-based model. This result has profound implications as
it can settle the issue of dynamical nonlocality in the quantum electromagnetic
interaction.

that the time-dependent geometric phase can be used to find the neutrino nature
and observe the CPT-violation because it is strongly enhanced under the

for a broad range of high-frequency fields. This is done both for the

approximate solutions of linear programs. In the special case of the optimal
transport problem, this technique dates back to the early work of
Schr\""odinger. This approach has recently been used successfully to solve
optimal transport related problems in several applied fields such as imaging
sciences, machine learning and social sciences. The main reason for this
success is that, in contrast to linear programming solvers, the resulting
algorithms are highly parallelizable and take advantage of the geometry of the

contribution of this article is the proof of the $\Gamma$-convergence of the
entropic regularized optimal transport problem towards the Monge-Kantorovich
problem for the squared Euclidean norm cost function. This implies in
particular the convergence of the optimal entropic regularized transport plan
towards an optimal transport plan as the entropy vanishes. Optimal transport
distances are also useful to define gradient flows as a limit of implicit Euler
steps according to the transportation distance. Our second contribution is a
proof that implicit steps according to the entropic regularized distance
converge towards the original gradient flow when both the step size and the

helium star would never fill its Roche-lobe \citep{t15}. At the moment of the

We find that the probability distribution of the velocity kick imparted to the

up to $ 260 \,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), indicating that this NS most probably received
a low kick velocity at birth.

in the continued downscaling of electronic components. A key challenge for
single-molecule electronics is to control the temperature of these junctions.
Controlling heating and cooling effects in individual vibrational modes, can in
principle, be utilized to increase stability of single-molecule junctions under
bias, to pump energy into particular vibrational modes to perform
current-induced reactions or to increase the resolution in inelastic electron
tunneling spectroscopy by controlling the life-times of phonons in a molecule
by suppressing absorption and external dissipation processes. Under bias the
current and the molecule exchange energy, which typically results in heating of
the molecule. However, the opposite process is also possible, where energy is
extracted from the molecule by the tunneling current. Designing a molecular
'heat sink' where a particular vibrational mode funnels heat out of the
molecule and into the leads would be very desirable. It is even possible to
imagine how the vibrational energy of the other vibrational modes could be
funneled into the 'cooling mode', given the right molecular design. Previous
efforts to understand heating and cooling mechanisms in single molecule
junctions, have primarily been concerned with small models, where it is unclear
which molecular systems they correspond to. In this paper, our focus is on
suppressing heating and obtaining current-induced cooling in certain
vibrational modes. Strategies for cooling vibrational modes in single-molecule
junctions are presented, together with atomistic calculations based on those
strategies. Cooling and reduced heating are observed for two different cooling
schemes in calculations of atomistic single-molecule junctions.

intermediate- and low-mass X-ray binaries (I/LMXBs) by combining binary

Using an updated BPS code we compute the evolution of massive binaries that
leads to the formation of incipient I/LMXBs, and present their distribution in
the initial donor mass vs. initial orbital period diagram. We then follow the
evolution of I/LMXBs until the formation of binary millisecond pulsars (BMSPs).
We find that the birthrate of the I/LMXB population is in the range of $
9\times10^{-6} - 3.4\times10^{-5} \, {\rm yr^{-1}}$, compatible with that of
BMSPs which are thought to descend from I/LMXBs. We show that during the
evolution of I/LMXBs they are likely to be observed as relatively compact
binaries with orbital periods $ \lesssim $ 1 day and donor masses $\lesssim 0.3
M_{\odot}$. The resultant BMSPs have orbital periods ranging from less than 1
day to a few hundred days. These features are consistent with observations of
LMXBs and BMSPs. We also confirm the discrepancies between theoretical
predications and observations mentioned in the literature, that is, the
theoretical average mass transfer rates ($ \sim 10^{-10} M_{\odot}
$\,yr$^{-1}$) of LMXBs are considerably lower than observed, and the number of

at estimating the distribution of optical parameters inside tissues from

and needs to be approached within the framework of inverse problems.
Photoacoustic images are three-dimensional and high-resolution. Furthermore,
high-resolution reconstructions of the optical parameters are targeted.
Therefore, in order to provide a practical method for quantitative
photoacoustic tomography, the inversion algorithm needs to be able to perform
successfully with problems of prominent size. In this work, an efficient
approach for the inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is
proposed, assuming an edge-preferring prior for the optical parameters. The
method is based on iteratively combining priorconditioned LSQR with a lagged
diffusivity step and a linearisation of the measurement model, with the needed
multiplications by Jacobians performed in a matrix-free manner. The algorithm
is tested with three-dimensional numerical simulations. The results show that
the approach can be used to produce accurate and high quality estimates of

charged and the neutral components of the inert doublet nearly degenerate in
mass have strong gamma-ray signals. Furthermore, for dark matter particle
masses above 1 TeV, we find that the non-observation of the continuum of

gives stronger constraints on the model parameters than the sharp spectral
features associated to annihilation into monochromatic photons and the internal

keV at maximum.We found a clear decline of the optical depth of the corona
electrons (close to values of 0.1), as well as of the total compactness ratio
lh/ls. The hard-to-hard/intermediate state spectral transition is mainly driven
by the increase in the soft photon flux in the corona, rather than small
variations of the electron heating. This, associated with the increasing of the
disc temperature, is consistent with a disc moving towards the compact object
scenario, i.e. the truncated-disc model. Moreover, this scenario is consistent
with the decreasing fractional squared rms and increasing of the noise and QPO
frequency. In our final group of observations, we found that the contribution
from the non-thermal Comptonisation to the total power supplied to the plasma
is 0.59+0.02/-0.05 and that the thermal electrons cool to kTe<26 keV.

of two-species Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into an optical lattice. Linear
inter-species coupling leads to Rabi transitions between the species. In the
regime of strong nonlinearity, a wavepacket corresponding to condensate
separates into localized and ballistic fractions. Localized fraction is
predominantly formed by immiscible solitons consisted of only one species.
Initial states without spatial separation of occupied sites expose formation of
immiscible solitons after a strongly chaotic transient. We calculate the
finite-time Lyapunov exponent as a rate of wavepacket divergence in the Hilbert
space. Using the Lyapunov analysis supplemented by Monte-Carlo sampling, it is
shown that appearance of immiscible solitons after the chaotic transient
corresponds to self-stabilization of the wavepacket. It is found that onset of
chaos is accompanied by fast variations of kinetic and interaction energies.
Crossover to self-stabilization is accompanied by reduction of condensate
density due to emittance of ballistically propagating waves. It turns out that
spatial separation of species should be a necessary condition for wavepacket
stability in the presence of linear inter-species coupling.

howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) lithologies containing carbonaceous
chondritic material, olivine, and impact-melt. The archived spectra of HEDs and
their mixtures, from RELAB, HOSERLab and USGS databases as well as our
laboratory-measured spectra are used for this study. Three-dimensional convex
polyhedrons are defined using computed band parameter values of laboratory
spectra. Polyhedrons based on the parameters of Band Tilt

((R0.75{\mu}m/R0.83{\mu}m)/(R0.83{\mu}m/R0.92{\mu}m)) and reflectance at 0.55

polyhedrons. The Arruntia region in the northern hemisphere of Vesta is
selected for a case study because of its geological and mineralogical
importance. We observe that this region is eucrite-dominated howarditic in
composition. The extent of olivine-rich exposures within an area of 2.5 crater
radii is ~ 12% larger than the previous finding (Thangjam et al., 2014).
Lithologies of nearly pure CM2-chondrite, olivine, glass, and diogenite are not
found in this region. Our spectral approach can be extended to the entire

functioning as refractive index sensors, is studied in detail. Two
configurations are considered, namely a linear waveguide coupled to a circular
one and two linear waveguides coupled to each other through a circular one. The
optimum coupling conditions are derived and it is shown that in both cases the
condition for the resonant wavelength, i.e. the wavelength at which the
transmission spectrum exhibits a dip (peak), is the same and depends only on
the geometrical characteristics of the circular waveguide and the effective
refractive index of the propagating mode. The latter, as well as the
corresponding mode profile, can be easily calculated through numerical
analysis. The sensitivity of the sensor is defined based on the dependence of
the effective refractive index on the refractive index of the environment.
Using a result of waveguide perturbation theory, the geometrical
characteristics of the core of the circular waveguide that maximize the
sensitivity of the system are determined. Both single and dual core
configurations are considered. It is found that, when optimally designed, the
sensor can detect relative refractive index changes of the order of 10^-4,
assuming that the experimental setup can detect relative wavelength shifts of
the order of 3x10^-5. Finally, the behavior of the system as bio-sensor is
examined by considering that a thin layer of bio-material is attached on the
surface of the waveguide core. It is found that, when optimally designed, the

thickness of 10 nm, and changes in the layer thickness of the order of 0.24 nm,

variation like regularizing term. To solve the convex minimization problem, we
extend the Douglas-Rachford algorithm and its parallel version to symmetric
Hadamard manifolds. The core of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm are reflections
of the functions involved in the functional to be minimized. In the Euclidean
setting the reflections of convex lower semicontinuous functions are
nonexpansive. As a consequence, convergence results for Krasnoselski-Mann
iterations imply the convergence of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm.
Unfortunately, this general results does not carry over to Hadamard manifolds,
where proper convex lower semicontinuous functions can have expansive
reflections. However, splitting our restoration functional in an appropriate
way, we have only to deal with special functions namely, several distance-like
functions and an indicator functions of a special convex sets. We prove that
the reflections of certain distance-like functions on Hadamard manifolds are
nonexpansive which is an interesting result on its own. Furthermore, the
reflection of the involved indicator function is nonexpansive on Hadamard
manifolds with constant curvature so that the Douglas-Rachford algorithm
converges here.
  Several numerical examples demonstrate the advantageous performance of the
suggested algorithm compared to other existing methods as the cyclic proximal
point algorithm or half-quadratic minimization. Numerical convergence is also
observed in our experiments on the Hadamard manifold of symmetric positive
definite matrices with the affine invariant metric which does not have a

galactic nuclei has been discussed for over two decades. A consensus, however,
is yet to be arrived at due to the lack of convincing evidence for their
detection. We present a detailed analysis of the broadband spectrophotometry of
the partially obscured quasar OI 287. The ultraviolet intermediate-width
emission lines (IELs) are very prominent, in high contrast to the corresponding
broad emission lines (BELs) which are heavily suppressed by dust reddening.
Assuming that the IELR is virialized, we estimated its distance to the central
black hole of $\sim 2.9$ pc, similar to the dust sublimation radius of $\sim
1.3$ pc. Photo-ionization calculations suggest that the IELR has a hydrogen
density of $\sim 10^{8.8}-10^{9.4} ~ \rm cm^{-3}$, within the range of values
quoted for the dusty torus near the sublimation radius. Both its inferred
location and physical conditions suggest that the IELR originates from the
inner surface of the dusty torus. In the spectrum of this quasar, we identified
only one narrow absorption-line system associated with the dusty material. With
the aid of photo-ionization model calculations, we found that the obscuring
material might originate from an outer region of the dusty torus. We speculate
that the dusty torus, which is exposed to the central ionizing source, may
produce IELs through photo-ionization processes, while also obscure BELs as a
natural ""coronagraph"". Such a ""coronagraph"" could be found in a large number of
partially obscured quasars and be a useful tool to study IELRs.

range of research fields. In higher organisms, habitat range evolution is
generally associated with genetic events such as gene duplication. However, the
specific factors that determine habitat variability remain unclear at higher
levels of biological organization (e.g., biochemical networks). One widely
accepted hypothesis developed from both theoretical and empirical analyses is
that habitat variability promotes network modularity; however, this
relationship has not yet been directly tested in higher organisms. Therefore, I
investigated the relationship between habitat variability and metabolic network
modularity using compound and enzymatic networks in flies and mammals. Contrary
to expectation, there was no clear positive correlation between habitat
variability and network modularity. As an exception, the network modularity
increased with habitat variability in the enzymatic networks of flies. However,
the observed association was likely an artifact, and the frequency of gene
duplication appears to be the main factor contributing to network modularity.
These findings raise the question of whether or not there is a general
mechanism for habitat range expansion at a higher level (i.e., above the gene
scale). This study suggests that the currently widely accepted hypothesis for
habitat variability should be reconsidered.

very weak computational entities that cannot control the way they interact. The
model of Network Constructors is a variant of Population Protocols capable of
(algorithmically) constructing abstract networks. Both models are characterized
by a fundamental inability to terminate. In this work, we investigate the
minimal strengthenings of the latter that could overcome this inability. Our
main conclusion is that initial connectivity of the communication topology
combined with the ability of the protocol to transform the communication
topology plus a few other local and realistic assumptions are sufficient to
guarantee not only termination but also the maximum computational power that
one can hope for in this family of models. The technique is to transform any
initial connected topology to a less symmetric and detectable topology without
ever breaking its connectivity during the transformation. The target topology
of all of our transformers is the spanning line and we call Terminating Line
Transformation the corresponding problem. We first study the case in which
there is a pre-elected unique leader and give a time-optimal protocol for
Terminating Line Transformation. We then prove that dropping the leader without
additional assumptions leads to a strong impossibility result. In an attempt to
overcome this, we equip the nodes with the ability to tell, during their
pairwise interactions, whether they have at least one neighbor in common.
Interestingly, it turns out that this local and realistic mechanism is
sufficient to make the problem solvable. In particular, we give a very
efficient protocol that solves Terminating Line Transformation when all nodes
are initially identical. The latter implies that the model computes with
termination any symmetric predicate computable by a Turing Machine of space
$\Theta(n^2)$.

covariates in the statistical model. Importantly, such nonlinear main effects
may be compatible (or, at least, not incompatible) with the current theoretical
framework. In the present literature this issue has only been studied in terms
of correlated (linearly dependent) covariates. Here we generalize to nonlinear
main effects (i.e., main effects of arbitrary shape) and dependent covariates.
We propose a novel nonparametric method to test for ambiguous interactions
where present parametric methods fail. We illustrate the method with a set of
simulations and with reanalyses (a) of effects of parental education on their

which is a fundamental property of continuum plasticity. In the past, multiple
models of the self energy of dislocations have been proposed in the literature
that partially contradict each other. In order to gain insight into the
relationship between dislocation microstructures and the free energy associated
with them, instead of deriving a model based on theoretical or phenomenological
arguments, here, these quantities are directly measured using large scale
molecular dynamics simulations. Plasticity is induced using nanoindentation
that creates an inhomogeneous distribution of dislocations as the result of
dislocation nucleation and multiplication caused by the local deformation.
Using this approach, the measurements of dislocation densities and free
energies are ab-initio, because only the interatomic potential is defining the
reaction of the system to the applied deformation. The simulation results
support strongly a linear relation between the scalar dislocation density and
the free energy, which can be related very well to the classical model of
mechanical energy of straight dislocations, even for the complex dislocation
networks considered here.

expansions, all of which augment the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD)
energy by a non-iterative correction for the effect of triple excitations.
Namely, the second- through sixth-order models of the recently proposed
CCSD(T-n) triples series [J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)] are compared to
the acclaimed CCSD(T) model for both unrestricted as well as restricted
open-shell Hartree-Fock (UHF/ROHF) reference determinants. By comparing UHF-
and ROHF-based statistical results for a test set of 18 modest-sized open-shell
species with comparable RHF-based results, no behavioral differences are
observed for the higher-order models of the CCSD(T-n) series in their
correlated descriptions of closed- and open-shell species. In particular, we
find that the convergence rate throughout the series towards the coupled
cluster singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT) solution is identical for the two
cases. For the CCSD(T) model, on the other hand, not only its numerical
consistency, but also its established, yet fortuitous cancellation of errors
breaks down in the transition from closed- to open-shell systems. The
higher-order CCSD(T-n) models (orders n>3) thus offer a consistent and
significant improvement in accuracy relative to CCSDT over the CCSD(T) model,
equally for RHF, UHF, and ROHF reference determinants, albeit at an increased
computational cost.

side all measured features of both occupied and unoccupied states are
reproduced, without significant deviations between observations and theory. We
also examine cohesive properties like the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus,
where we find, in general, a good agreement between theory and measurements. In
addition we have reproduced the spin and orbital moments of these elements, as
they are reflected from measurements of the saturation moment. We have also
employed the Hubbard I approximation to extract the interatomic exchange
parameters of an effective spin Hamiltonian for the heavy rare earths. We show
that the Hubbard I approximation gives results which are consistent with
calculations where $4f$ electrons are treated as core states for Gd. The latter
approach was also used to address the series of the heavy/late rare-earths. Via
Monte Carlo simulations we obtained ordering temperatures which reproduce
measurements within about $20\%$. We have further illustrated the accuracy of
these exchange parameters by comparing measured and calculated magnetic
configurations for the heavy rare earths and the magnon dispersion for Gd. The
Hubbard I approximation is compared to other theories of the electronic
structure, and we argue that it is superior. We discuss the relevance of our
results in general, and how this makes it possible to treat the electronic
structure of materials containing rare-earth elements, such as permanent
magnets, magnetostrictive compounds, photovoltaics, optical fibers, topological
insulators, and molecular magnets.

resonances in orbits and properties of the final planets, we studied the
effects of these resonances as well. We have divided this study into two parts.
In Part 1, we are interested in examining the effects of secular resonances on
the formation of Mars and orbital stability of terrestrial planets. In Part 2,
our goal is to determine trends that may exist between the disk surface density
profile and the final properties of terrestrial planets. In the context of the
depleted disk model, results show that the nu_5 resonance does not have a
significant effect on the final orbits of terrestrial planets. However, nu_6
and nu_16 resonances play important roles in clearing their affected areas
ensuring that no additional mass will be scattered into the accretion zone of
Mars so that it can maintain its mass and orbital stability. In Part 2, our
results indicate that despite some small correlations, in general, no trend
seems to exist between the disk surface density profile and the mean number of
the final planets, their masses, time of formation, and distances to the
central star. We present the results of our simulations and discuss their
implications for the formation of Mars and other terrestrial planets, as well

analytical calculations as well as model example that neither definitions of

for the chemical potential. This remains true regardless of the system size.
Therefore, our results cast doubt on the validity of the adiabatic invariance

commentary on the derivation of thermostatistics from mechanics which typically

dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, with two localized components linearly mixed
by the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and the intrinsic nonlinearity represented by
the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) between atomic magnetic moments polarized
in-plane by an external magnetic field. Recently, stable solitons were
predicted in the form of \textit{semi-vortices} (composites built of coupled
fundamental and vortical components) in the 2D system combining the SOC and
contact attractive interactions. Replacing the latter by the anisotropic
long-range DDI, we demonstrate that, for a fixed norm of the soliton, the

vortex solitons (AVSs), parameterized by an offset of the pivot of the vortical
component relative to its fundamental counterpart. The offset is limited by a
certain maximum value, while the energy of the AVS practically does not depend
on the offset. At small values of the norm, the vortex solitons are subject to
a weak oscillatory instability. In the present system, with the Galilean
invariance broken by the SOC, the composite solitons are set in motion by a
kick whose strength exceeds a certain depinning value. The kicked solitons
feature a negative effective mass, drifting along a spiral trajectory opposite
to the direction of the kick. A critical angular velocity, up to which the

shows that the optimal rate of convergence can be achieved through existing

the induced metric is invariant under translations along the null generators.
In this case the group of soldering transformations turns out to be infinite

both massless matter and impulsive gravitational wave components. We also
rephrase this result in the language of Carrollian symmetry groups. To
illustrate this phenomenon we discuss in detail the example of shells on the

their isotropic angular distribution, combined with the fact that they
exhibited an intensity distribution that deviated strongly from the $-3/2$
power law. This finding was later confirmed with the first redshift, equal to
at least $z=0.835$, measured for GRB970508. Despite this result, the data from
$CGRO$/BATSE and $Swift$/BAT indicate that long GRBs are indeed distributed
isotropically, but the distribution of short GRBs is anisotropic. $Fermi$/GBM
has detected 1669 GRBs up to date, and their sky distribution is examined in
this paper. A number of statistical tests is applied: nearest neighbour
analysis, fractal dimension, dipole and quadrupole moments of the distribution
function decomposed into spherical harmonics, binomial test, and the two point
angular correlation function. Monte Carlo benchmark testing of each test is
performed in order to evaluate its reliability. It is found that short GRBs are
distributed anisotropically on the sky, and long ones have an isotropic
distribution. The probability that these results are not a chance occurence is
equal to at least 99.98\% and 30.68\% for short and long GRBs, respectively.
The cosmological context of this finding and its relation to large-scale
structures is discussed.

$\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ in these models are governed by the electroweak
operator $Q_8$ for which the hadronic matrix element is rather well known so
that our analysis of NP contributions is subject to much smaller uncertainties
than within the SM. We consider seven 331 models selected in our earlier
analysis on the basis of electroweak precision data. Imposing the constraints
from $\Delta F=2$ transitions we find that only three of these models can
provide a significant positive shift in $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ up to
$6\times 10^{-4}$ for $M_{Z^\prime}=3$ TeV. Two of them allow simultaneously a
supression of ${\cal B}(B_{s}\to \mu^+\mu^-)$ by $20\%$, bringing the theory
closer to the data without any significant impact on the Wilson coefficient
$C_9$. The third one provides also the shift $\Delta C_9=-0.6$, softening the
anomalies in $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$, without any significant impact on $B_{s}\to
\mu^+\mu^-$. NP effects in rare $K$ decays and in $B\to K(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ turn
out to be small. The flavour structure of 331 models implies that even for
$M_{Z^\prime}=30$ Tev a shift of $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ up to $8\times

fermionic particles evolving in imaginary-time from a domain-wall initial state
is solved. The main interest of this toy-model is that it exhibits the arctic
circle phenomenon, namely a spatial phase separation between a critically
fluctuating region and a frozen region. Large-scale correlations inside the
critical region are expressed in terms of correlators in a (euclidean)
two-dimensional massless Dirac field theory. It is observed that this theory is
inhomogenous: the metric is position-dependent, so it is in fact a Dirac field
theory in curved space. The technique used to solve the toy-model is then
extended to deal with the transfer matrices of other models: dimers on the
honeycomb and square lattice, and the six-vertex model at the free fermion
point ($\Delta=0$). In all cases, explicit expressions are given for the
long-range correlations in the critical region, as well as for the underlying
Dirac action. Although the setup developed here is heavily based on fermionic
observables, the results can be translated into the language of height
configurations and of the gaussian free field, via bosonization. Correlations
close to the phase boundary and the generic appearance of Airy processes in all

We find that a non-perturbative system of massive gluons (scenario I) and a
system dominated by quarks and antiquarks (scenario II) lead to different
hadronic observables when imposing the same initial energy-momentum tensor
$T_{\mu \nu}(x)$ just after the passage of the impinging nuclei. In case of the
gluonic initial condition the formation of $s,{\bar s}$ pairs in the QGP
proceeds rather slow such that the anti-strange quarks and accordingly the
$K^+$ mesons do not achieve chemical equilibrium even in central Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Accordingly, the $K^+$ rapidity
distribution is suppressed in the gluonic scenario and in conflict with the
data from the BRAHMS Collaboration. The proton and antiproton rapidity
distributions also disfavor the scenario I. Furthermore, a clear suppression of
direct photon and dilepton production is found for the pure gluonic initial
conditions which is not so clearly seen in the present photon and dilepton
spectra from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV due to a large
contribution from other channels. It is argued that dilepton spectra in the

consistent with the presence of near-zone tails. Our end result at 4PN order is
Lorentz invariant and has the correct self-force limit for the energy of

post-decoupling distortion of the polarization $E$-modes due to the
gravitational lensing effect of large-scale structures. These lensing-induced
$B$-modes constitute both a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution and
an important contaminant for the extraction of the primary CMB $B$-modes from
inflation. Planck provides accurate nearly all-sky measurements of both the
polarization $E$-modes and the integrated mass distribution via the
reconstruction of the CMB lensing potential. By combining these two data
products, we have produced an all-sky template map of the lensing-induced
$B$-modes using a real-space algorithm that minimizes the impact of sky masks.
The cross-correlation of this template with an observed (primordial and
secondary) $B$-mode map can be used to measure the lensing $B$-mode power
spectrum at multipoles up to $2000$. In particular, when cross-correlating with
the $B$-mode contribution directly derived from the Planck polarization maps,
we obtain lensing-induced $B$-mode power spectrum measurement at a significance
level of $12\,\sigma$, which agrees with the theoretical expectation derived
from the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model. This unique nearly all-sky
secondary $B$-mode template, which includes the lensing-induced information
from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim \ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is
delivered as part of the Planck 2015 public data release. It will be
particularly useful for experiments searching for primordial $B$-modes, such as
BICEP2/Keck Array or LiteBIRD, since it will enable an estimate to be made of
the lensing-induced contribution to the measured total CMB $B$-modes.

  Journal",,"10.3847/0004-637X/819/1/47",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emission from neutron stars and accretion disks in low-mass X-ray binaries is
not isotropic. The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the
neutron star by the disk and vice versa cause the observed flux to depend on
the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of
special importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are
powered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star.
Because part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst
flux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star
and reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance,
mass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.
Previous studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst
flux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of
two exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first
time for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as
opposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the
reflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk
can account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors
for different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy
factors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the
anisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger
than unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in
height, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could
possibly be induced by the X-ray burst, if X-ray heating causes the inner disk
to puff up.

magnetic field which crossed over to positive magnetoresistance at very strong
magnetic fields and was completely suppressed with an increase of temperature.
We ascribe these unusual features to effects of temperature and magnetic field
on a degree of disorder. The temperature dependent disorder is related to
charge redistribution between different localized states with an increase of
temperature. The magnetic field dependent disorder is also related by charge
redistribution between different centers, however in this case an important
role is played by the doubly occupied states of the upper Hubbard band, their
occupation being sensitive to magnetic field due to on-site spin correlations.

the fine-grained image classification, which aims to differentiate subtle

is able to locate similar images at different levels of relevance, e.g.,
discovering cars from the same make or the same model, both of which require

fine-grained feature representations by jointly optimizing both classification
and similarity constraints. 2) To model the multi-level relevance, label
structures such as hierarchy or shared attributes are seamlessly embedded into
the framework by generalizing the triplet loss. Extensive and thorough
experiments have been conducted on three fine-grained datasets, i.e., the
Stanford car, the car-333, and the food datasets, which contain either
hierarchical labels or shared attributes. Our proposed method has achieved very
competitive performance, i.e., among state-of-the-art classification accuracy.
More importantly, it significantly outperforms previous fine-grained feature

the histograms of their data in the first dataset with the histograms from the

identification task is introduced. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness
of this method on three different types of datasets and in multiple scenarios.
Using datasets such as call data records, web browsing histories, and GPS
trajectories, we show that a large fraction of users can be easily identified
given only histograms of their data; hence these histograms can act as users'
fingerprints. We also verify that simultaneous identification of users achieves
better performance compared to one-by-one user identification. We show that
using the optimal method for identification gives higher identification
accuracy than heuristics-based approaches in practical scenarios. The accuracy
obtained under this optimal method can thus be used to quantify the maximum
level of user identification that is possible in such settings. We show that
the key factors affecting the accuracy of the optimal identification algorithm

such as $k$-anonymity and its extensions. However, it is often disregarded that
the utility of differentially private outputs is quite limited, either because
of the amount of noise that needs to be added to obtain them or because utility
is only preserved for a restricted type and/or a limited number of queries. On
the contrary, $k$-anonymity-like data releases make no assumptions on the uses

general-purpose differentially private data releases. This paper extends such

more flexible and utility-preserving than alternative anonymization methods
used in the literature, in order to reduce the amount of noise needed to
satisfy differential privacy. In this way, we improve the utility of
differentially private data releases. Moreover, the noise reduction we achieve

relativistic shocks tend to produce short-scale, self-generated magnetic
turbulence that leads to a scattering mean free path (mfp) with a stronger
momentum dependence than the mfp ~ p dependence for Bohm diffusion. In
unmagnetized shocks, this turbulence is strong enough to dominate the
background magnetic field so the shock can be treated as parallel regardless of
the initial magnetic field orientation, making application to gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), pulsar winds, Type Ibc supernovae, and extra-galactic radio sources
more straightforward and realistic. In addition to changing the scale of the
shock precursor, we show that, when nonlinear effects from efficient Fermi
acceleration are taken into account, the momentum dependence of the mfp has an
important influence on the efficiency of cosmic-ray production as well as the
accelerated particle spectral shape. These effects are absent in
nonrelativistic shocks and do not appear in relativistic shock models unless
nonlinear effects are self-consistently described. We show, for limited
examples, how the changes in Fermi acceleration translate to changes in the
intensity and spectral shape of gamma-ray emission from proton-proton
interactions and pion-decay radiation.

of analytic functions $\psi_j:B_1\to Y$, each function being analytically
extendable, as a mapping to $Y$, to a four times larger concentric ball $B_4$.
  Main result of this paper is an upper bound on the minimal number
$\kappa({\U})$ of charts in doubling coverings of a manifold $Y$, being a
compact part of a non-singular level hypersurface $Y=\{P=c\}$, where $P$ is a
polynomial on $\C^n$ with non-degenerated critical points. We show that
$\kappa({\U})$ is of order $\log({1}/{\rho})$, where $\rho$ is the distance
from $Y$ to the singular set of $P$.
  Our main motivation is that doubling coverings form a special class of
""smooth parameterizations"", which are used in bounding entropy type invariants
in smooth dynamics on one side, and in bounding density of rational points in
diophantine geometry on the other. Complexity of smooth parameterizations is a
key issue in some important open problems in both areas.
  We also present connections between doubling coverings and doubling
inequalities for analytic functions $f$ on $Y$, which compare the maxima of
$|f|$ on couples of compact domains $\Omega\subset G$ in $Y$. We shortly
indicate connections with Kobayashi metric and with Harnack inequality.

additional masking freedom allows improving data utility in several ways, such
as increasing data granularity, reducing the impact of outliers and avoiding

protect against attribute disclosure, which occurs if the variability of the

issue, several refinements of $k$-anonymity have been proposed, among which
$t$-closeness stands out as providing one of the strictest privacy guarantees.
Existing algorithms to generate $t$-close data sets are based on generalization
and suppression (they are extensions of $k$-anonymization algorithms based on

estimate the macroeconomic costs and benefits of climate policy. It shows that
the vast majority of models used for assessing climate policy use assumptions
about the financial system that sit at odds with the observed reality. In
particular, the models' assumptions lead to `crowding out' of capital, which
cause them to show negative impacts from climate policy in virtually all cases.
We compare this approach with that of the E3ME model, which follows
non-equilibrium economic theory and adopts a more empirical approach. While the
non-equilibrium model also has limitations, its treatment of the financial
system is more consistent with reality and it shows that green investment need
not crowd out investment in other parts of the economy -- and may therefore
offer an economic stimulus.
  The implication of this finding is that standard CGE models consistently
over-estimate the costs of climate policy in terms of GDP and welfare,
potentially by a substantial amount. These findings overly restrict the range
of possible emission pathways accessible using climate policy from the
viewpoint of the decision-maker, and may also lead to misleading information
used for policy making. Improvements in both modelling approaches should be
sought with some urgency -- both to provide a better assessment of potential
climate policy and to improve understanding of the dynamics of the global
financial system more generally.

multi-valued, modular-invariant function of a local function field. In this
paper, we concentrate on basic definitions and questions of convergence.
  Note: This version contains a correction to the published version of Theorem
3. The error that was found is not in any way serious, but its correction does
change slightly the statement of Theorem 3 appearing in the published version.
Otherwise, it has no impact on this article nor any of its sequels.

  Wrinkling, Rolling, and Twisting","91 pages, 35 figures, review article",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-shaping of curved structures, especially those involving flexible thin
layers, has attracted increasing attention because of their broad potential
applications in e.g. nanoelectromechanical/micro-electromechanical systems
(NEMS/MEMS), sensors, artificial skins, stretchable electronics, robotics, and
drug delivery. Here, we provide an overview of recent experimental,
theoretical, and computational studies on the mechanical self-assembly of
strain-engineered thin layers, with an emphasis on systems in which the
competition between bending and stretchingenergy gives rise to a variety
ofdeformations,such as wrinkling, rolling, and twisting. We address the
principle of mechanical instabilities, which is often manifested in wrinkling
or multistability of strain-engineered thin layers. The principles of shape
selection and transition in helical ribbons are also systematically examined.
We hope that a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanical principles
underlying these rich phenomena can foster the development of new techniques
for manufacturing functional three- dimensional structures on demand for a
broad spectrum of engineering applications.

$$\mu(y)f(\sigma(y)xz_0)-f(xyz_0) = 2f(x)f(y), \;x,y\in G$$ on monoids, and

  information on the journal website",,"10.1057/palcomms.2015.38",,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polarization of opinion is an important feature of public debate on
political, social and cultural topics. The availability of large internet
databases of users' ratings has permitted quantitative analysis of polarization
trends-for instance, previous studies have included analyses of controversial
topics on Wikipedia, as well as the relationship between online reviews and a
product's perceived quality. Here, we study the dynamics of polarization in the
movie ratings collected by the Internet Movie database (IMDb) website in
relation to films produced over the period 1915-2015. We define two statistical
indexes, dubbed hard and soft controversiality, which quantify polarized and
uniform rating distributions, respectively. We find that controversy decreases
with popularity and that hard controversy is relatively rare. Our findings also
suggest that more recent movies are more controversial than older ones and we
detect a trend of ""convergence to the mainstream"" with a time scale of roughly
40-50 years. This phenomenon appears qualitatively different from trends
observed in both online reviews of commercial products and in political debate,
and we speculate that it may be connected with the absence of long-lived ""echo
chambers"" in the cultural domain. This hypothesis can and should be tested by
extending our analysis to other forms of cultural expression and/or to
databases with different demographic user bases.

originate in the superfluid interior of neutron stars. Superfluid flow in a
model neutron star is simulated by solving the equations of motion of a
two-component superfluid consisting of a viscous proton-electron plasma and an
inviscid neutron condensate in a spherical Couette geometry. We examine the
response of our model neutron star to glitches induced in three different ways:
by instantaneous changes of the spin frequency of the inner and outer
boundaries, and by instantaneous recoupling of the fluid components in the
bulk. All simulations are performed with strong and weak mutual friction. It is
found that the maximum size of a glitch that originates in the bulk decreases
as the mutual friction strengthens. It is also found that mutual friction
determines the fraction of the frequency jump which is later recovered, a
quantity known as the 'healing parameter'. These behaviours may explain some of
the diversity in observed glitch recoveries.

complementary device applications involving MoS2. However, MoS2 PFET is rarely
achieved due to pinning effect resulting high Rc at metal-MoS2 interface and
the inherently strong n-type property of the MoS2 material. In this study, we
realized a high-performance multi-layer MoS2 PFET via controllable chemical
doping, which has an excellent on/off ratio of 107 and a maximum hole mobility
of 72 cm2/Vs at room temperature, and these values are further exceeding to 109
and 132 cm2/Vs at 133K. In addition, we revealed that large Rc hindered the
polar transition of MoS2 FET from n-type to p-type, meanwhile channel Rs
limited Ion of PFET. Therefore it is suggested that reducing Rc at high work
function metal-MoS2 interface and p-type doping of channel were necessary for
achieving high performance MoS2 PFET. Based on the high performance PFET, we
successfully demonstrated a MoS2 CMOS inverter by integrating NFET and PFET.
