our formalism to the radial structure of magnetized accretion disks threaded by

Tauri, and FU Orionis stars. We consider two levels of disk magnetization,
$\lambda_{sys} = 4$ (strongly magnetized disks), and $\lambda_{sys} = 12$
(weakly magnetized disks). The rotation rates of strongly magnetized disks have
large deviations from Keplerian rotation. In these models, resistive heating
dominates the thermal structure for the FU Ori disk. The T Tauri disk is very
thin and cold because it is strongly compressed by magnetic pressure; it may be
too thin compared with observations. Instead, in the weakly magnetized disks,
rotation velocities are close to Keplerian, and resistive heating is always
less than 7\% of the viscous heating. In these models, the T Tauri disk has a
larger aspect ratio, consistent with that inferred from observations. All the
disks have spatially extended hot atmospheres where the irradiation flux is
absorbed, although most of the mass ($\sim 90-95$ \%) is in the disk midplane.
With the advent of ALMA one expects direct measurements of magnetic fields and
their morphology at disk scales. It will then be possible to determine the
mass-to-flux ratio of magnetized accretion disks around young stars, an
essential parameter for their structure and evolution. Our models contribute to
the understanding of the vertical structure and emission of these disks.

to improve prosthetic limbs. Existing flexible sensors achieved sensitivities
of <100 mK and large responsivity albeit within narrow (<5 K) temperature
ranges. Other flexible devices, working in wider temperature ranges, exhibit
orders of magnitude poorer responses. However, much more versatile and
temperature sensitive membranes are present in animals such as pit vipers,
whose pit membranes have the highest sensitivity and responsivity in nature and
are used to locate warm-blooded preys at distance. Here, we show that pectin
films mimic the sensing mechanism of pit membranes and parallel their record
performances. These films map temperature on surfaces with a sensitivity of at
least 10 mK in a wide temperature range (45 K), have very high responsivity,
and detect warm bodies at distance. The produced material can be integrated as
a layer in artificial skins platforms and boost their temperature sensitivity
to reach the best biological performance.

results have shown that the GSF energies along the < 10-10 > direction
drastically reduce when H atoms locate nearby the slip plane. But H atoms
slightly decrease the GSF barrier for the <11-20> slipping case. Meanwhile,
with the increase of hydrogen density around the slip plane, the GSF energies
along both the two shift directions further reduced greatly. The physical
origin of the reduction of GSF energies due to the existence of hydrogen atoms
in Zr was analyzed based on the Bader charge method. It is interpreted by the
Coulomb repulsion of the Zr atoms beside the slip plane due to the charge

  Here, we study Type Ia (SN~Ia) surroundings of single and double degenerate
systems, and their observational signatures. Winds may originate from the
progenitor prior to the white dwarf (WD) stage, the WD, a donor star, or an
accretion disk (AD). For M_Ch explosions,the AD wind dominates and produces a
low-density void several light years across surrounded by a dense shell. The
bubble explains the lack of observed interaction in late time SN light curves
for, at least, several years. The shell produces narrow ISM lines Doppler
shifted by 10-100 km/s, and equivalent widths of approximately 100 mA and 1 mA
in case of ambient environments with constant density and produced by prior
mass loss, respectively. For SN 2014J, both mergers and M_Ch mass explosions
have been suggested based on radio and narrow lines.
  As a consistent and most likely solution, we find an AD wind running into an
environment produced by the RG wind of the progenitor during the pre-WD stage,
and a short delay, 0.013 to 1.4 Myr, between the WD formation and the
explosion. Our framework may be applied more generally to stellar winds and

G_A(Q^2) (axial-vector form factor) and G_P(Q^2) (induced pseudoscalar form
factor), are calculated based on the constituent quark axial form factors and
the octet baryon wave functions. The quark axial current is parametrized by the
two constituent quark form factors, the axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2),
and the induced pseudoscalar form factor g_P^q(Q^2). The baryon wave functions
are composed of a dominant S-state and a P-state mixture for the relative
angular momentum of the quarks. First, we study in detail the nucleon case. We
assume that the quark axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2) has the same function
form as that of the quark electromagnetic isovector form factor. The remaining
parameters of the model, the P-state mixture and the Q^2-dependence of
g_P^q(Q^2), are determined by a fit to the nucleon axial form factor data
obtained by lattice QCD simulations with large pion masses. In this lattice QCD
regime the meson cloud effects are small, and the physics associated with the
valence quarks can be better calibrated. Once the valence quark model is
calibrated, we extend the model to the physical regime, and use the low Q^2
experimental data to estimate the meson cloud contributions for G_A(Q^2) and
G_P(Q^2). Using the calibrated quark axial form factors, and the generalization
of the nucleon wave function for the other octet baryon members, we make
predictions for all the possible weak interaction axial form factors G_A(Q^2)

corresponding experimental data for G_A(0), and with the estimates of

extremes of a stationary time series. There are standard approaches to marginal
modelling, but long- and short-range dependence of extremes may both appear. In
applications, an assumption of long-range independence often seems reasonable,
but short-range dependence, i.e., the clustering of extremes, needs attention.
The extremal index $0<\theta\le 1$ is a natural limiting measure of clustering,
but for wide classes of dependent processes, including all stationary Gaussian
processes, it cannot distinguish dependent processes from independent processes
with $\theta=1$. Eastoe and Tawn (2012) exploit methods from multivariate
extremes to treat the subasymptotic extremal dependence structure of stationary
time series, covering both $0<\theta<1$ and $\theta=1$, through the
introduction of a threshold-based extremal index. Inference for their
dependence models uses an inefficient stepwise procedure that has various
weaknesses and has no reliable assessment of uncertainty. We overcome these
issues using a Bayesian semiparametric approach. Simulations and the analysis

particular we are searching for clumpy structures in the 3D subspace formed by
two position coordinates and radial velocity. The aim of the method is the
detection of kinematic segregated radial velocity groups, that is, radial
velocity intervals whose associated stars are spatially concentrated. To this
end we define a kinematic segregation index, $\tilde{\Lambda}$(RV), based on
the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) graph algorithm, which is estimated for a set
of radial velocity intervals in the region. When $\tilde{\Lambda}$(RV) is
significantly greater than 1 we consider that this bin represents a grouping in
the phase space. We split a star-forming region into radial velocity bins and
calculate the kinematic segregation index for each bin, and then we obtain the
spectrum of kinematic groupings, which enables a quick visualization of the
kinematic behaviour of the region under study. We carried out numerical models
of different configurations in the subspace of the phase space formed by the
coordinates and the radial velocity that various case studies illustrate. The
analysis of the test cases demonstrates the potential of the new methodology
for detecting different kind of groupings in phase space.

(assumed to represent the bulge + halo components) and disk components and use
it to assign to each GC a probability of belonging to one of the two
components. Then we model the galaxy kinematics, assuming a disk and spheroidal
component, using planetary nebulae (PNe) and integrated stellar light. We use
this kinematic model and the probability previously obtained from the
photometry to recalculate for each GC its likelihood of being associated with
the disk, the spheroid, or neither. We find that the reddest GCs are likely to
be associated with the disk, as found for faint fuzzies in this same galaxy,
suggesting that the disk of this S0 galaxy originated at z ~ 2. The majority of
blue GCs are found likely to be associated with the spheroidal (hot) component.
The method also allows us to identify objects that are unlikely to be in

visual attributes or natural language semantics to define the relations between
output visual classes and then use these relationships to draw inference on new
unseen classes at test time. In a novel extension to this idea, we propose the
use of visual prototypical concepts as side information. For most real-world
visual object categories, it may be difficult to establish a unique prototype.
However, in cases such as traffic signs, brand logos, flags, and even natural
language characters, these prototypical templates are available and can be
leveraged for an improved recognition performance. The present work proposes a
way to incorporate this prototypical information in a deep learning framework.
Using prototypes as prior information, the deepnet pipeline learns the input
image projections into the prototypical embedding space subject to minimization
of the final classification loss. Based on our experiments with two different
datasets of traffic signs and brand logos, prototypical embeddings incorporated
in a conventional convolutional neural network improve the recognition
performance. Recognition accuracy on the Belga logo dataset is especially
noteworthy and establishes a new state-of-the-art. In zero-shot learning
scenarios, the same system can be directly deployed to draw inference on unseen
classes by simply adding the prototypical information for these new classes at
test time. Thus, unlike earlier approaches, testing on seen and unseen classes
is handled using the same pipeline, and the system can be tuned for a trade-off
of seen and unseen class performance as per task requirement. Comparison with
one of the latest works in the zero-shot learning domain yields top results on
the two datasets mentioned above.

fluorescence of a three-level atom. The corresponding incoherent spectrum
contains a very narrow inelastic peak on top of a two-level-like spectrum.
Using the theories of balanced and conditional homodyne detection we study
ensemble averaged phase-dependent fluctuations of intermittent resonance
fluorescence. The sharp peak is found only in the spectra of the squeezed
quadrature. In balanced homodyne detection that peak is positive, which greatly
reduces the squeezing, also seen in its variance. In conditional homodyne
detectionCHD, for weak to moderate laser intensity, the peak is negative,
enhancing the squeezing, and for strong fields the sidebands become dispersive
which, together with the positive sharp peak dominate the spectrum. The latter
effect is due to non-negligible third order fluctuations produced by the
atom-laser nonlinearity and the increased steady state population of the
shelving state. A simple mathematical approach allows us to obtain accurate
analytical results.

overcome the difficulties inherent to this higher dimensional setting by
identifying the irreducible representations for natural actions on the
functional that take into account the invariances of the problem thus allowing
for reducing the bifurcation analysis to a subspace with symmetries. We are
able to describe at least two bifurcation branches, one of which is stable,
highlighting the richer landscape of energy critical states in the three

assuming the magnetic field is very strong, and are able to relate this to a

low-mass LAEs at low redshift, and more compact than the Lyman-break galaxies

memory function in the hippocampus and in the cortex. In these models, memories
are stored in the plastic recurrent connections of neural populations in the
form of ""attractor states"". The maximal information capacity for conventional
abstract attractor networks with unconstrained connections is 2 bits/synapse.
However, an unconstrained synapse has the capacity to store infinite amount of
bits in a noiseless theoretical scenario: a capacity that conventional
attractor networks cannot achieve. Here, I propose a hierarchical attractor
network that can achieve an ultra high information capacity. The network has
two layers: a visible layer with $N_v$ neurons, and a hidden layer with $N_h$
neurons. The visible-to-hidden connections are set at random and kept fixed
during the training phase, in which the memory patterns are stored as
fixed-points of the network dynamics. The hidden-to-visible connections,
initially normally distributed, are learned via a local, online learning rule
called the Three-Threshold Learning Rule and there is no within-layer
connections. The results of simulations suggested that the maximal information
capacity grows exponentially with the expansion ratio $N_h/N_v$. As a first
order approximation to understand the mechanism providing the high capacity, I
simulated a naive mean-field approximation (nMFA) of the network. The
exponential increase was captured by the nMFA, revealing that a key underlying
factor is the correlation between the hidden and the visible units.
Additionally, it was observed that, at maximal capacity, the degree of symmetry
of the connectivity between the hidden and the visible neurons increases with
the expansion ratio. These results highlight the role of hierarchical
architecture in remarkably increasing the performance of information storage in
attractor networks.

plane-parallel) and the nature of the gravitational potential. Global linear
analysis gives a similar value for the fastest growing thermal instability
modes in spherical and Cartesian geometries. Simulations and observations
suggest that cooling in halos critically depends on the ratio of the cooling
time to the free-fall time ($t_{cool}/t_{ff}$). Extended cold gas condenses out
of the ICM only if this ratio is smaller than a threshold value close to 10.
Previous works highlighted the difference between the nature of cold gas
condensation in spherical and plane-parallel atmospheres; namely, cold gas
condensation appeared easier in spherical atmospheres. This apparent difference
due to geometry arises because the previous plane-parallel simulations focussed
on {\em in situ} condensation of multiphase gas but spherical simulations
studied condensation {\em anywhere} in the box. Unlike previous claims, our
nonlinear simulations show that there are only minor differences in cold gas
condensation, either in situ or anywhere, for different geometries. The amount
of cold gas condensing depends on the shape of the gravitational potential
well; gas has more time to condense if gravitational acceleration decreases
toward the center. In our idealized simulations with heating balancing cooling
in each layer, there can be significant mass/energy/momentum transfer across
layers that can trigger condensation and drive $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$ far beyond the
critical value close to 10. Triggered condensation is very prominent in
plane-parallel simulations, in which a large amount of cold gas condenses out.

full maximum likelihood analysis fitting an eclipse model confirms a
periodicity of 310 \pm 1 days. The power spectrum of the signal in the
outburstless state of the source does not follow a flicker noise behaviour and
so, the system producing it is not self-organised. This and the fact that the
periodicity is better defined in the outburstless state, strongly suggests that
it is not produced by any internal physical processes associated to the central
engine. The simplest physical mechanism to which this periodicity could be
ascribed is a dynamical effect produced by an orbiting supermassive black hole
companion eclipsing the central engine. Interestingly, the optimal eclipse
model infers a brightness enhancement of (136.4 \pm 20 )%, suggesting an
eclipse resulting in a gravitational lensing brightening. Consisting with this

processes, we derive four different universal bounds valid beyond the Gaussian
regime. Different variants of these bounds apply to either the entropy change
or any individual current, e.g., the rate of substrate consumption in a
chemical reaction or the electron current in an electronic device. The bounds
vary with respect to their degree of universality and tightness. A universal
parabolic bound on the generating function of an arbitrary current depends
solely on the average entropy production. A second, stronger bound requires
knowledge both of the thermodynamic forces that drive the system and of the
topology of the network of states. These two bounds are conjectures based on
extensive numerics. An exponential bound that depends only on the average
entropy production and the average number of transitions per time is rigorously
proved. This bound has no obvious relation to the parabolic bound but it is
typically tighter further away from equilibrium. An asymptotic bound that
depends on the specific transition rates and becomes tight for large
fluctuations is also derived. This bound allows for the prediction of the
asymptotic growth of the generating function. Even though our results are
restricted to networks with a finite number of states, we show that the
parabolic bound is also valid for three paradigmatic examples of driven
diffusive systems for which the generating function can be calculated using the
additivity principle. Our bounds provide a new general class of constraints for
nonequilibrium systems.

spectral classifications and radial velocities. For three multi-slit fields
covering 8% of our sample, we carried out monitoring observations over 9-16
epochs to study binarity, finding a spectroscopic, massive binary frequency of
at least $\sim$60% in this subsample. Classical Oe/Be stars represent a large
fraction of RIOTS4 (42%), occurring at much higher frequency than in the
Galaxy, consistent with expectation at low metallicity. RIOTS4 confirmed a
steep upper IMF in the field, apparently caused by the inability of the most
massive stars to form in the smallest clusters. Our survey also yields evidence
for in-situ field OB star formation, and properties of field emission-line star
populations, including sgB[e] stars and classical Oe/Be stars. We also discuss
the radial velocity distribution and its relation to SMC kinematics and runaway
stars. RIOTS4 presents a first quantitative characterization of field OB stars

low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm star}=2\times10^6-5\times10^{10}{\rm M_{\odot}}$)
using the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulations. While previous
studies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we
investigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration,
size evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows
drive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales
via two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming,
producing young stars that migrate $\sim1{\rm\,kpc}$ within their first $100
{\rm\,Myr}$, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the
global potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce
several dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by
factors of $>2$ over $\sim200 {\rm\,Myr}$, and these rapid size fluctuations
can account for much of the observed scatter in radius at fixed $M_{\rm star}.$
Second, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat
stellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This
age-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and
metallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating
radial star-formation histories from stellar populations at $z=0$ can be
severely biased. These effects are strongest at $M_{\rm
star}\approx10^{7-9.6}{\rm M_{\odot}}$, the same regime where feedback most
efficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics
in low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic
solutions to small-scale problems in $\Lambda$CDM.

precision of various binary-pulsar observations. Our analysis is valid for
binary systems with orbital period longer than a day. By comparing this effect
with pulsar-timing measurements, it is possible to derive model-independent
upper bounds on the dark-matter density at different distances $D$ from the
Galactic center. For example, the precision timing of J1713+0747 imposes
$\rho_{\rm DM}\lesssim 10^5\,{\rm GeV/cm}^3$ at $D\approx7\,{\rm kpc}$. The
detection of a binary pulsar at $D\lesssim 10\,{\rm pc}$ could provide

straightforward within this framework. We demonstrate the technique with toy

factors of 5 smaller than for the sample precision matrix for thousands of

stellar mass $M_{\star}$, we determine the best fit stellar mass-halo mass

intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation. The resulting mass trend is
$M_{\star}\propto M_{500}^{0.69\pm0.15}$, the intrinsic (log-normal) scatter is
$\sigma_{\ln M_{\star}|M_{500}}=0.36^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, and there is no
significant redshift trend $M_{\star}\propto (1+z)^{-0.04\pm0.47}$, although
the uncertainties are still large. We also examine $M_{\star}$ within a fixed
projected radius of $0.5$~Mpc, showing that it provides a cluster binding mass
proxy with intrinsic scatter of $\approx93\%$ (1$\sigma$ in $M_{500}$). We
compare our $M_{\star}=M_{\star}(M_{500}, z)$ scaling relation from the XMM-BCS

After correcting for the known mass measurement systematics in the compared

only weakly on redshift out to $z\approx1$.

(IGrM) provide important constraints on the feedback processes associated with
massive galaxy formation and evolution. Here we explore these constraints via a
detailed analysis of the global properties of simulated z<3 galaxy groups from
a cosmological simulation that includes a well-constrained prescription for
stellar/supernovae-powered galactic outflows but no AGN feedback. Our aims are
to (a) establish a baseline against which we will compare future models; (b)
identify model successes due to stellar/supernovae-powered outflows; and (c)
pinpoint features that signal the need for, and constrain the nature of, AGN
feedback.
  Our simulation successfully reproduces key observed z=0 group IGrM
properties, including the various X-ray Lx - Tx - entropy scaling relations,
for all but the most massive groups. The z<1 redshift evolution of these also
agree with observations. Contrary to expectations, the simulated groups' IGrM
does not suffer catastrophic cooling. Yet, the z=0 group stellar mass is ~ 2X
too large. This is due to the build-up of cold gas in the massive galaxies
before they are incorporated inside groups. This in turn indicates that other
feedback mechanisms must activate in real galaxies once their stellar masses
grow to a few X 10^{10} M_sun. We show that these must be powerful enough to
expel a significant fraction of the gas from the galactic halos. Gentle
maintenance-mode (quenching) AGN feedback, as seen in galaxy clusters, will not
do. Just as importantly, we find that the stellar/supernovae-powered winds are
essential for understanding the IGrM metal abundances. Our simulation is able
to reproduce the observed relationship between the global IGrM iron and silicon
abundance and the group X-ray temperature, and these results ought to be
relatively insensitive to the addition of AGN feedback.

how the location of this centre is affected by the choice of observable -
stars, hot gas, or the full mass distribution as can be probed by the
gravitational potential. We explore several measures of cluster centre: the
minimum of the gravitational potential, which would expect to define the centre
if the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium; the peak of the density; the centre
of BCG; and the peak and centroid of X-ray luminosity. We find that the centre
of BCG correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potential
than the X-ray defined centres, while AGN feedback acts to significantly
enhance the offset between the peak X-ray luminosity and minimum gravitational
potential. These results highlight the importance of centre identification when
interpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoretical

few years and has connections to proving lower bounds and deterministic
identity testing. In this paper we present a polynomial time randomized
algorithm for reconstructing $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(2)$ circuits over $\mathbb{F}$
($char(\mathbb{F})=0$), i.e. depth$-3$ circuits with fan-in $2$ at the top
addition gate and having coefficients from a field of characteristic $0$. The
algorithm needs only a blackbox query access to the polynomial $f \in
\mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ of degree $d$, computable by a
$\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(2)$ circuit $C$. In addition, we assume that ""simple rank"" of
this polynomial (essential number of variables after removing gcd of the two
multiplication gates) is bigger than a constant. Our algorithm runs in time
$poly(n, d)$ and returns an equivalent $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(2)$ circuit(with high
probability). The problem of reconstructing $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(2)$ circuits over
finite fields was first proposed by Shpilka in [24]. The generalization to
$\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(k)$ circuits, $k = O(1)$ (over finite fields) was addressed by
Karnin and Shpilka in [15]. The techniques in these previous involve iterating
over all objects of certain kinds over the ambient field and thus running time
depends on size of the field $\mathbb{F}$. Their reconstruction algorithm uses
lower bounds on the lengths of Linear Locally Decodable Codes with $2$ queries.
In our settings, such ideas immediately pose a problem and we need new ideas to
handle the case of the characteristic $0$ field $\mathbb{F}$. Our main
techniques are based on the use of Quantitative Syslvester Gallai Theorems from
the work of Barak et.al. [3] to find a small collection of subspaces to project
onto. The heart of our paper lies in subtle applications of Quantitative

high-dimensional datasets with- out imposing restrictive or opaque modeling
assumptions. This paper describes a domain-general data analysis method called
CrossCat. CrossCat infers multiple non-overlapping views of the data, each
consisting of a subset of the variables, and uses a separate nonparametric
mixture to model each view. CrossCat is based on approximately Bayesian
inference in a hierarchical, nonparamet- ric model for data tables. This model
consists of a Dirichlet process mixture over the columns of a data table in
which each mixture component is itself an independent Dirichlet process mixture
over the rows; the inner mixture components are simple parametric models whose
form depends on the types of data in the table. CrossCat combines strengths of
mixture modeling and Bayesian net- work structure learning. Like mixture
modeling, CrossCat can model a broad class of distributions by positing latent
variables, and produces representations that can be efficiently conditioned and
sampled from for prediction. Like Bayesian networks, CrossCat represents the
dependencies and independencies between variables, and thus remains accurate
when there are multiple statistical signals. Inference is done via a scalable
Gibbs sampling scheme; this paper shows that it works well in practice. This
paper also includes empirical results on heterogeneous tabular data of up to 10
million cells, such as hospital cost and quality measures, voting records,
unemployment rates, gene expression measurements, and images of handwritten
digits. CrossCat infers structure that is consistent with accepted findings and
common-sense knowledge in multiple domains and yields predictive accuracy
competitive with generative, discriminative, and model-free alternatives.

the dust luminosity declines more slowly than in pure collisional cascades,
with $n \approx$ 0.5-0.8 instead of 1.1-1.2. Throughout this decline, giant
impacts produce large, observable spikes in dust luminosity which last roughly
0.01-0.1 Myr and recur every 1-10 Myr. If most solar-type stars have Earth mass

asymptotic weak chaos, and intermediate strong chaos, separated by a crossover

localization transition, and two distinct phases - a localization phase, and a

  Investigation into Graph Curvature's Ability to Measure Congestion in Network

""curvature"" of a network, but there is no consensus on the definition for this
term. A common approach in these applications is to derive from the curvature
either a ""logical center"" of the network or a tree representation of the
network (these would only exist when the curvature is negative), but that such
structures can be extracted using curvature alone remains largely conjectural.
A connection between one type of curvature -- Gromov's hyperbolicity -- and a
tree representation has been known for decades, and recently it has also been
connected for unweighted graphs to a logical center. We extend the connection
between Gromov's hyperbolicity and a logical center to weighted graphs, and we
construct counterexamples showing that no other proposed definition for
curvature implies the existence of a logical center. We also consider the
leading methods to construct a tree representation of the network and the
leading methods to measure the quality of the representation, and show that,
despite wildly different descriptions, they are asymptotically equivalent.
  These results resolve several conjectures, including a conjecture of
Dourisboure and Gavoille on a $2$-approximation method for calculating

community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best
application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for
their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both.
Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy
have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper,
we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting
and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge
of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT
measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures,
which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special
cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the
following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI
should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters;
AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist
small clusters.

open up the possibility of uncoordinated sharing of spectrum licenses between

show that sharing spectrum licenses increases the per-user rate when antennas
have narrow beams and is also favored when there is a low density of users. We
also consider a multi-operator system where BSs of all the networks are
co-located to show that the simultaneous sharing of spectrum and infrastructure
is also feasible. We show that all networks can share licenses with less
bandwidth and still achieve the same per-user median rate as if they each had

that there is a distribution over sequences of operations with $O(n)$
insertions and deletions, and $O(n^{0.01})$ queries, for which any data

core-collapse supernovae that launch collimated relativistic outflows (jets).
All gamma-ray-burst-associated supernovae are spectroscopically of Type Ic with
broad lines, but the fraction of broad-lined Type Ic supernovae harboring
low-luminosity gamma-ray-burst remains largely unconstrained. Some supernovae
should be accompanied by off-axis $\gamma$-ray burst jets that remain invisible
initially, but then emerge as strong radio sources (as the jets decelerate).
However, this critical prediction of the jet model for gamma-ray bursts has yet
to be verified observationally. Here, we present K. G. Jansky Very Large Array
observations of 15 broad-lined supernovae of Type Ic discovered by the Palomar
Transient Factory in an untargeted manner. Most of the supernovae in our sample
exclude radio emission observationally similar to that of the radio-loud,
relativistic SN\,1998bw. We constrain the fraction of 1998bw-like broad-lined
Type Ic supernovae to be <~ 41% (99.865% confidence). Most of the events in our
sample also exclude off-axis jets similar to GRB 031203 and GRB 030329, but we
cannot rule out off-axis gamma-ray-bursts expanding in a low-density wind
environment. Three supernovae in our sample are detected in the radio. PTF11qcj
and PTF14dby show late-time radio emission with average ejecta speeds of
~(0.3-0.4)c, on the dividing line between relativistic and ""ordinary""
supernovae. The speed of PTF11cmh radio ejecta is poorly constrained. We
estimate that <~ 85% (99.865% confidence) of the broad-lined Type Ic supernovae
in our sample may harbor off-axis $\gamma$-ray-bursts expanding in media with
densities in the range probed by this study.

the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathcal{O}_{p})$, another is the geometrical
characterization of the $p-$adic M\""obius maps and its application, and the
other is different norms of the $p-$adic M\""obius maps. Firstly, we give a
series of equations of the $p-$adic M\""obius maps in

unitary aspects. Furthermore, the properties of
$\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathcal{O}_{p})$ can be applied to study the geometrical
characterization, the norms, the decomposition theorem of $p-$adic M\""obius
maps, and the convergence and divergence of $p-$adic continued fractions.
Secondly, we classify the $p-$adic M\""obius maps into four types and study the
geometrical characterization of the $p-$adic M\""obius maps from the aspects of
fixed points in $\mathbb{P}^{1}_{Ber}$ and the invariant axes which yields the
decomposition theorem of $p-$adic M\""obius maps. Furthermore, we prove that if
a subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}_{p})$ containing elliptic elements
only, then all elements fix the same point in $\mathbb{H}_{Ber}$ without using
the famous theorem--Cartan fixed point theorem, and this means that this
subgroup has potentially good reduction. In the last part, we extend the
inequalities obtained by Gehring and Martin\cite{F.G1,F.G2}, Beardon and Short

M\""obius maps are between the matrix, chordal, three-point and unitary norms.
This part of work can be applied to study the convergence of the sequence of
$p-$adic M\""obius maps which can be viewed as a special cases of the work in

highly variable during flaring activities. It is frequently argued that shocks
are the main driver of the flaring events. However, the spectral variability
modelings generally lack detailed considerations of the self-consistent
magnetic field evolution modeling, thus so far the associated optical
polarization signatures are poorly understood. We present the first
simultaneous modeling of the optical radiation and polarization signatures
based on 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic shocks in the
blazar emission environment, with the simplest physical assumptions. By
comparing the results with observations, we find that shocks in a weakly
magnetized environment will largely lead to significant changes in the optical
polarization signatures, which are seldom seen in observations. Hence an
emission region with relatively strong magnetization is preferred. In such an
environment, slow shocks may produce minor flares with either erratic
polarization fluctuations or considerable polarization variations, depending on
the parameters; fast shocks can produce major flares with smooth PA rotations.
In addition, the magnetic fields in both cases are observed to actively revert
to the original topology after the shocks. All these features are consistent
with observations. Future observations of the radiation and polarization
signatures will further constrain the flaring mechanism and the blazar emission
environment.

for each dendrite based on its activation level. It trains the WTA network
through formation and elimination of connections between inputs and synapses.
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed network and learning rule, we
employ it to solve two, four and six class classification of random Poisson
spike time inputs. The results indicate that by proper tuning of the inhibitory
time constant of the WTA, a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity of
the network can be achieved. We use the inhibitory time constant to set the
number of subpatterns per pattern we want to detect. We show that while the

100% when each pattern is subdivided into 5 or 10 subpatterns. However, the

states in networks of finitely many phase oscillators. Here we generalize the
definition of a weak chimera to a more general class of equivariant dynamical
systems by characterizing solutions in terms of the isotropy of their angular
frequency vector - for coupled phase oscillators the angular frequency vector
is given by the average of the vector field along a trajectory. Symmetries of
solutions automatically imply angular frequency synchronization. We show that
the presence of such symmetries is not necessary by giving a result for the
existence of weak chimeras without instantaneous or setwise symmetries for
coupled phase oscillators. Moreover, we construct a coupling function that
gives rise to chaotic weak chimeras without symmetry in weakly coupled
populations of phase oscillators with generalized coupling.

found that each flare developed a jet structure that evolved in a manner
similar to evolution of the blowout jet : 1) an inverted-Y shape jet appeared
and drifted away from its initial position; 2) jets formed a curtain-like
structure that consisted of many fine threads accompanied with subsequent
brightenings near the footpoints of the fine threads; and finally 3) the jet
showed a twisted structure visible near the flare maximum. Analysis of the HMI
data showed that both the negative magnetic flux and the magnetic helicity have
been gradually increasing in the positive polarity region indicating the
continuous injection of magnetic twist before and during the series of flares.
Based on these results, we suggest that the continuous emergence of twisted
magnetic flux played an important role in producing a successive flares and
developing a series of blowout jets.

that the matrix of the reciprocal of the binary diffusivities, $V$, is low

low rank representation of matrix $V$ is computed in a fast manner at a
computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury

bulk states by an on-site potential applied on the outmost sites of the
boundary. On bilayer honeycomb lattice, bosonic edge state traversing the gap
at half filling is demonstrated. The topological origin of the bosonic edge
states is discussed with pseudo Berry curvature. The results will simulate
experimental studies of these exotic bosonic edge states with ultracold bosons

important technique to solve PWM problems, which control the output voltage of
an inverter via selecting appropriate switching angles. Based on the Rational
Univariate Representation (RUR) theory for solving polynomial systems, the
paper presents an algorithm to compute a ""nearly parametric"" solution to a
SHEPWM problem. When the number of switching angles N is fixed, a ""nearly
parametric"" solution can be considered as functions of the modulation index m.
So we can adapt the amplitude of the output voltage with the same source
voltage by changing the modulation index. When m is given as a specific value,
complete solutions to the SHEPWM problem can be obtained easily using
univariate polynomial solving. Compared with other methods, m is considered as
a symbolic parameter for the first time, and this can help avoid totally
restarting when m changes. The average time for computing complete solutions
associated to 460 modulation indexes based on a ""nearly parametric"" solution
when N=5 is 0.0284s, so the algorithm is practical. Three groups of switching
angles associated to N=5, m=0.75 is simulated in MATLAB, and it verifies the
algorithm's correctness.

changes over time. Due to this dynamic nature, it becomes difficult to propose
suitable growth models that can explain the various important characteristic
properties of these networks. In fact, in many application oriented studies
only knowing these properties is sufficient. We, in this paper show that even
if the network structure at a future time point is not available one can still
manage to estimate its properties. We propose a novel method to map a temporal
network to a set of time series instances, analyze them and using a standard
forecast model of time series, try to predict the properties of a temporal
network at a later time instance. We mainly focus on the temporal network of
human face- to-face contacts and observe that it represents a stochastic
process with memory that can be modeled as ARIMA. We use cross validation
techniques to find the percentage accuracy of our predictions. An important
observation is that the frequency domain properties of the time series obtained
from spectrogram analysis could be used to refine the prediction framework by
identifying beforehand the cases where the error in prediction is likely to be
high. This leads to an improvement of 7.96% (for error level <= 20%) in
prediction accuracy on an average across all datasets. As an application we
show how such prediction scheme can be used to launch targeted attacks on
temporal networks.

of reionization are known to violate photon number conservation, in the sense
that the mass fraction in ionized bubbles in these models does not equal the
ratio of the number of ionizing photons produced by sources and the number of
hydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium. E.g., for a Planck13 cosmology with
electron scattering optical depth $\tau\simeq0.066$, the discrepancy is
$\sim15$ per cent for $x_{\rm HII}=0.1$ and $\sim5$ per cent for $x_{\rm
HII}=0.5$. We demonstrate that this problem arises from a fundamental
conceptual shortcoming of the excursion set approach (already recognised in the
literature on this formalism) which only tracks average mass fractions instead
of the exact, stochastic source counts. With this insight, we build an
approximately photon number conserving Monte Carlo model of bubble growth based
on partitioning regions of dark matter into halos. Our model, which is formally
valid for white noise initial conditions (ICs), shows dramatic improvements in
photon number conservation, as well as substantial differences in the bubble
size distribution, as compared to traditional models. We explore the trends
obtained on applying our algorithm to more realistic ICs, finding that these
improvements are robust to changes in the ICs. Since currently popular
semi-numerical schemes of bubble growth also violate photon number
conservation, we argue that it will be worthwhile to pursue new, explicitly
photon number conserving approaches. Along the way, we clarify some
misconceptions regarding this problem that have appeared in the literature.

their circumstellar envelopes. A further consequence of thermal pulses is the
formation of detached shells of gas and dust around the star. We aim to
determine the physical properties of the detached gas shell around R
Sculptoris, in particular the shell mass and temperature, and to constrain the
evolution of the mass-loss rate during and after a thermal pulse. We analyse
CO(1-0), CO(2-1), and CO(3-2) emission, observed by. The spatial resolution of
the ALMA data allows us to separate the detached shell emission from the
extended emission inside the shell. We perform radiative transfer modelling of
both components to determine the shell properties and the post-pulse mass-loss
properties. The ALMA data show a gas shell with a radius of 19.5"" expanding at
14.3km/s. The different scales probed by the ALMA Cycle 0 array show that the
shell must be entirely filled with gas, contrary to the idea of a detached
shell. The comparison to single-dish spectra and radiative transfer modelling
confirms this. We derive a shell mass of 4.5e-3 Msun with a temperature of 50K.
Typical timescales for thermal pulses imply a pulse mass-loss rate of 2.3e-5
Msun/yr. For the post-pulse mass-loss rate, we find evidence for a gradual
decline of the mass-loss rate, with an average value of 1.6e-5 Msun/yr. The
total amount of mass lost since the last thermal pulse is 0.03 Msun, a factor
four higher compared to classical models, with a sharp decline in mass-loss
rate immediately after the pulse. We find that the mass-loss rate after a
thermal pulse has to decline more slowly than generally expected from models of
thermal pulses. This may cause the star to lose significantly more mass during
a thermal pulse cycle, which affects the chemical evolution of the star and the
interstellar medium.

coefficient {\mu} depends on the nominal contact pressure p. We discuss several
possible origins of the pressure dependency of {\mu}: (a) saturation of the
contact area (and friction force) due to high nominal squeezing pressure, (b)
non-linear viscoelasticity, (c) non-randomness in the surface topography, in
particular the influence of the skewness of the surface roughness profile, (d)
adhesion, and (e) frictional heating. We show that in most cases the
non-linearity in the {\mu}(p) relation is mainly due to process (e) (frictional
heating), which softens the rubber, increases the area of contact, and (in most
cases) reduces the viscoelastic contribution to the friction. In fact, since
the temperature distribution in the rubber at time t depends on on the sliding
history (i.e., on the earlier time t0 < t), the friction coefficient at time t
will also depend on the sliding history, i.e. it is, strictly speaking, a time
integral operator. The energy dissipation in the contact regions between solids
in sliding contact can result in high local temperatures which may strongly
affect the area of real contact and the friction force (and the wear-rate).
This is the case for rubber sliding on road surfaces at speeds above 1 mm/s. In
Ref. [14] we have derived equations which describe the frictional heating for
solids with arbitrary thermal properties. In this paper the theory is applied
to rubber friction on road surfaces. Numerical results are presented and
compared to experimental data. We observe good agreement between the calculated

funda- mental nature that a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson, called a dilaton,
in the Einstein frame acquires a nonzero mass through the loop effects which
occur with the Higgs field in the relativistic quantum field theory as
described by poles of D, spacetime dimensionality off the physical value D = 4.
Naturally the technique of dimensional regulairzation is fully used to show
this pole structure to be suppressed to be finite by what is called a

from a comprehensive perspective. In most cases, the data and the technology
are already in place, therefore it is important to provide an easily-accessible
package that combines datasets from multiple telescopes at different
wavelengths. In order to achieve this, we are working to produce a data
analysis pipeline that allows the data reduction from different instruments
without needing detailed knowledge of each observation. Ideally, the specifics
of each observation are automatically dealt with, while the necessary
information on how to handle the data in each case is provided by a tutorial
that is included in the program. We first focus our project on the study of
pulsars and their wind nebulae (PWNe) at radio and gamma-ray frequencies. In
this way, we aim to combine time-domain and imaging datasets at two extremes of
the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the emission has the same
non-thermal origin in pulsars at radio and gamma-ray frequencies, and the
population of electrons is believed to be the same at these energies in PWNe.
The final goal of the project will be to unveil the properties of these objects
by tracking their behaviour using all of the available multi-wavelength data.

others: Expectation Maximization, Neural Networks with Evolutionary Algorithms

problem. The presence of missing data entries in databases render the tasks of
decision-making and data analysis nontrivial. As a result this area has
attracted a lot of research interest with the aim being to yield accurate and
time efficient and sensitive missing data imputation techniques especially when
time sensitive applications are concerned like power plants and winding
processes. In this article, considering arbitrary and monotone missing data
patterns, we hypothesize that the use of deep neural networks built using
autoencoders and denoising autoencoders in conjunction with genetic algorithms,
swarm intelligence and maximum likelihood estimator methods as novel data
imputation techniques will lead to better imputed values than existing
techniques. Also considered are the missing at random, missing completely at
random and missing not at random missing data mechanisms. We also intend to use
fuzzy logic in tandem with deep neural networks to perform the missing data
imputation tasks, as well as different building blocks for the deep neural
networks like Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks to
test our hypothesis. The motivation behind this article is the need for missing
data imputation techniques that lead to better imputed values than existing

problem into a discussion purely about probability, which we analyse from a
Bayesian standpoint. We argue that the existence of a unique maximising
probability distribution $\{p(j\vert K)\}$ for states labelled by $j$ given
data $K$ implies that the corresponding maximal value of the information
entropy $\sigma(\{(p_j\vert K)\}) = -\sum_j (p_j \vert K)\ln{(p_j\vert K)}$
depends explicitly on the data at equilibrium and on the Hamiltonian of the
system. As such, it is a direct measure of our uncertainty about the exact
state of the body and can be identified with the traditional thermodynamic
entropy. We consider the well known microcanonical, canonical and grand
canonical methods and ensure that the fluctuations about mean values are
generally minuscule for macroscopic systems before identifying these mean
values with experimental observables and thereby connecting to many standard
results from thermodynamics. Unexpectedly, we find that it is not generally
possible for a quantum process to be both isentropic and reversibly adiabatic.
This is in sharp contrast to traditional thermodynamics where it is assumed
that isentropic, reversible adiabatic processes can be summoned up on demand
and easily realised. By contrast, we find that linear relations between
pressures $P_j$ and energies $E_j$ are necessary and sufficient conditions for
a quasi-static and adiabatic change to be isentropic, but, of course, this
relationship only holds for a few especially simple systems, such as the
perfect gas, and is not generally true for more complicated systems. By
considering the associated entropy increases up to second order in small volume
changes we argue that the consequences are in practice negligible.

large-scale knowledge graph as elements in a continuous vector space. Existing
methods, e.g., TransE and TransH, learn embedding representation by defining a
global margin-based loss function over the data. However, the optimal loss
function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a
closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with
different entities and relations share the same set of candidate loss
functions, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited
performance of embedding related applications. In this paper, we propose a
locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called
TransA, to find the optimal loss function by adaptively determining its margin

demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to
the-state-of-the-art ones.

combine the study of extremes with regression and other methods. A useful tool
for reducing the role of nuisance regression, while we are interested in the
shape or tails of the basic distribution, is provided by the averaged
regression quantile and namely by the average extreme regression quantile. Both
are weighted means of regression quantile components, with weights depending on
the regressors. Our primary interest is the averaged extreme regression
quantile (AERQ), its structure, qualities and its applications, e.g. in
investigation of a conditional loss given a value exogenous economic and market
variables. AERQ has several interesting equivalent forms: While it is
originally defined as an optimal solution of a specific linear programming
problem, hence is a weighted mean of responses corresponding to the optimal
base of the pertaining linear program, we give another equivalent form as a
maximum residual of responses from a specific R-estimator of the slope
components of regression parameter. The latter form shows that while AERQ
equals to the maximum of some residuals of the responses, it has minimal
possible perturbation by the regressors. Notice that these finite-sample
results are true even for non-identically distributed model errors, e.g. under
heteroscedasticity. Moreover, the representations are formally true even when
the errors are dependent - this all provokes a question of the right
interpretation and of other possible applications.

networks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display
both scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in
capturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or

purpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To
do so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is
defined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours
the emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature
may be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect
topics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that,
in general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations,

exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918

Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the

neurons typically choose a small set of features present in the world ---
contrast and luminance for vision, pitch and intensity for sound --- and
assemble a stimulus set that systematically varies along these dimensions.
Subsequent analysis of neural responses to these stimuli typically focuses on
regression models, with experimenter-controlled features as predictors and
spike counts or firing rates as responses. Unfortunately, this approach
requires knowledge in advance about the relevant features coded by a given
population of neurons. For domains as complex as social interaction or natural
movement, however, the relevant feature space is poorly understood, and an
arbitrary \emph{a priori} choice of features may give rise to confirmation
bias. Here, we present a Bayesian model for exploratory data analysis that is
capable of automatically identifying the features present in unstructured
stimuli based solely on neuronal responses. Our approach is unique within the
class of latent state space models of neural activity in that it assumes that
firing rates of neurons are sensitive to multiple discrete time-varying
features tied to the \emph{stimulus}, each of which has Markov (or semi-Markov)
dynamics. That is, we are modeling neural activity as driven by multiple
simultaneous stimulus features rather than intrinsic neural dynamics. We derive
a fast variational Bayesian inference algorithm and show that it correctly
recovers hidden features in synthetic data, as well as ground-truth stimulus
features in a prototypical neural dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the
algorithm, we also apply it to cluster neural responses and demonstrate
successful recovery of features corresponding to monkeys and faces in the image

theorems for slice regular functions with respect to regular diameter and slice
diameter respectively, together with a Cauchy type estimate. Along with these

strengthen a version of boundary Schwarz lemma first proved in \cite{WR} for
quaternionic slice regular functions, with a completely new approach. Our

a well-known Osserman type estimate and provides additionally all the extremal

(compare-and-swap, load-logical/store-conditional). It deals with conditionals

kinds of parallelism (external, internal, propagation-free and two kinds of
in-flight parallelism). There are $\mathbb{B}$ and $\mathbb{U}$ modalities to
regulate propagation, and temporal modalities $\mathsf{since}$,
$\mathbb{S}\mathsf{ofar}$ and $\mathbb{O}\mathsf{uat}$ to deal with global
coherence (SC per location).

stability rules have been simplified: in particular the sat and x= x tests have
been eliminated from external stability checks. The embedding is simplified and
has a more transparent relation to the mechanisms of the logic. Definitions of

  Instability of Flame Propagation with Infinite Lewis Number","6 figures, Proceedings of the Combustion Institute (2016)",,,,"physics.flu-dyn nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of flame propagation in systems with infinite Lewis number and
spatially discretized sources of heat release is examined, which is applicable
to the combustion of suspensions of fuel particles in air. The system is
analyzed numerically using a one-dimensional heat equation with a source term
for the reaction progress variable, which is specified to have zero
diffusivity, and the model reveals a spectrum of flame-propagation regimes. For
the case of a switch-type reaction rate and homogeneous media (continuous
regime), the flame propagates steadily at a velocity in agreement with
analytical solutions. As the sources are spatially concentrated into
{\delta}-function-like sources, propagation approaches the discrete regime with
a fixed period between ignition of the sources, for which an analytic solution
is also available for validation. When the source term is governed by an
Arrhenius rate and the activation energy is increased beyond the stability
boundary, the flame begins to exhibit a long-wavelength (4-5 times the thermal
flame thickness) oscillation characteristic of the thermo-diffusive
instability, in good agreement with prior stability analysis. When spatial
discreteness is introduced, a competition is observed between the long-period
oscillations of the thermo-diffusive instability and the pulsations associated
with the rapid heat release of the concentrated sources. Interestingly, the
presence of spatial discreteness is able to excite higher modes (period
doubling and chaotic solutions) of the thermo-diffusive instability, suggesting
that the introduction of discreteness may have an influence qualitatively
similar to that of increasing activation energy. Relevance of the model
parameters to experimental systems is then discussed.

properties in the regime of high electron densities ($\sim10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$)
were reported, which can be related to additional two-dimensional layered
conductivity, hampering the identification of the topological surface states.
Here, we report that quantum corrections to the electronic conduction are
dominated by the surface states for a semiconducting case, which can be
analyzed by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model for two coupled surfaces in the
case of strong spin-orbit interaction. However, in the metallic-like case this
analysis fails and additional two-dimensional contributions need to be
accounted for. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and quantized Hall resistance
prove as strong indications for the two-dimensional layered metallic behavior.
Temperature-dependent magnetotransport properties of high-quality Bi$_2$Se$_3$

of the dynamical behavior of dust grains in the solar radiation field, we
estimated that the long narrow structure would be composed of 1 mm-1 cm grains
having an ejection velocity of >50 m/s. The velocity was more than one order of
magnitude faster than that of millimeter - centimeter grains from typical
comets around a heliocentric distance rh of 2.5 AU. We considered that sudden
sublimation of a large amount of water ice (about 10^30 mol/s) would be
responsible for the high ejection velocity. We finally estimated a total mass

  Transactions on Geospace and Remote Sensing",,"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2505686",,"physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a feasibility study for a high frame rate, short baseline auroral
tomographic imaging system useful for estimating parametric variations in the
precipitating electron number flux spectrum of dynamic auroral events. Of
particular interest are auroral substorms, characterized by spatial variations
of order 100 m and temporal variations of order 10 ms. These scales are thought
to be produced by dispersive Alfv\'en waves in the near-Earth magnetosphere.
The auroral tomography system characterized in this paper reconstructs the
auroral volume emission rate to estimate the characteristic energy and location
in the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of peak electron
precipitation flux using a distributed network of precisely synchronized
ground-based cameras. As the observing baseline decreases, the tomographic
inverse problem becomes highly ill-conditioned; as the sampling rate increases,
the signal-to-noise ratio degrades and synchronization requirements become
increasingly critical. Our approach to these challenges uses a physics-based
auroral model to regularize the poorly-observed vertical dimension.
Specifically, the vertical dimension is expanded in a low-dimensional basis
consisting of eigenprofiles computed over the range of expected energies in the
precipitating electron flux, while the horizontal dimension retains a standard
orthogonal pixel basis. Simulation results show typical characteristic energy
estimation error less than 30% for a 3 km baseline achievable within the
confines of the Poker Flat Research Range, using GPS-synchronized Electron
Multiplying CCD cameras with broad-band BG3 optical filters that pass prompt
auroral emissions.

annealing at 600C in conditions of a closed system, the Ge granular film
transforms to the usual wetting layer and Ge clusters with multimodal size
distribution and the Ge oval drops having the highest number density. After the
long-term thermal treatment of the Ge film at the same temperature, Ge drops
disappear; the large clusters increase their sizes at the expense of the
smaller ones. The total density of Ge clusters on the surface drastically
decreases. The wetting layer mixed c(4 x 2) + p(2 x 2) reconstruction
transforms to the single c(4 x 2) one which is likely thermodynamically
favoured. Pyramids or domes are not observed on the surface after any
annealing.

extensions of Schwarzschild's spacetime structure has led to even wilder
conjectures, such as white holes and passages to other universes. Penrose

simple model and resolve the `gauge-fixing' issues and extend the analysis to
scalar field models and show that our approach can be applied to any order of
perturbation for any first order derivative fields. In the case of Galilean
scalar fields, our procedure can extract constrained relations at all orders in
perturbations leading to the fact that there is no extra degrees of freedom due
to the presence of higher time derivatives of the field in the Lagrangian. We
compare and contrast our approach to the Lagrangian approach (Chen et al
[2006]) for extracting higher order correlations and show that our approach is
quick and robust and can be applied to any model of gravity and matter fields.

implementation of the techniques known as Quantum Image Processing. The most
serious problem is the recovery of the outcomes after the quantum measurement,
which will be demonstrated in this work that is equivalent to a noise
measurement, and it is not considered in the literature on the subject. It is
noteworthy that this is due to several factors: 1) a classical algorithm that
uses Dirac's notation and then it is coded in MATLAB does not constitute a
quantum algorithm, 2) the literature emphasizes the internal representation of
the image but says nothing about the classical-to-quantum and
quantum-to-classical interfaces and how these are affected by decoherence, 3)
the literature does not mention how to implement in a practical way (at the
laboratory) these proposals internal representations, 4) given that Quantum
Image Processing works with generic qubits this requires measurements in all
axes of the Bloch sphere, logically, and 5) among others. In return, the
technique known as Quantum Boolean Image Processing is mentioned, which works
with computational basis states (CBS), exclusively. This methodology allows us
to avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters the results of the
measured except in the case of CBS. Said so far is extended to quantum
algorithms outside image processing too.

(or bounded), the continuity (or boundedness) is preserved. More precisely: Let
$H$ be a closed subset of a metric space $X$ and let $Z$ be a normed vector
space. Let $f: H\to Z$ be a Baire one function. We show that there is a
continuous function $g: (X\setminus H) \to Z$ such that, for every $a\in
\partial H$, the non-tangential limit of $g$ at a equals $f(a)$ and, moreover,
if $f$ is continuous at $a\in H$ (respectively bounded in a neighborhood of
$a\in H$) then the extension $F=f\cup g$ is continuous at $a$ (respectively
bounded in a neighborhood of $a$).
  We also prove a result on pointwise approximation of vector-valued Baire one
functions by a sequence of locally Lipschitz functions that converges
""uniformly"" (or, ""continuously"") at points where the approximated function is
continuous.
  In an accompanying paper (Extensions of vector-valued functions with
preservation of derivatives), the main result is applied to extensions of
vector-valued functions defined on a closed subset of Euclidean or Banach space

property.

without Mg coating, insulating \b{eta}-Fe1-xSe phase with iron-vacancy
disorders is the main phase and more likely to be the parent phase of FeSe
superconducting system. Proper Mg coating on the surface of FeSe films can lead
to Mg entering FeSe crystal lattice to fill up these Fe vacancies rather than
replace Fe. Simultaneously, additional electron doping is introduced and the
electron carrier concentration in this parent phase can be tuned, which is
responsible for the SIT and evolution of superconductivity in this system.
However, abnormal decrease of electron concentration was found in FeSe film
with excessive Mg coating, which brings about the severe degradation in
superconducting performance.
