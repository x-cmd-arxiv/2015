modulated density passes through the stack consisting of two plates with
different thicknesses and electrodynamic properties. The new elegant expression
for the frequency-angular distribution of transition radiation is obtained.
Using the existence of resonant frequency at which the longitudinal form-factor
of bunch not suppresses radiation coherence and choosing parameters for the
stack of plates, one can also avoid suppression of the radiation coherence by
transverse form-factor of bunch. The radiation from a bunch with modulated
density in the process SASE FEL can be partially coherent at a resonant
frequency. Then the intense sub monochromatic beam of X-ray photons is formed.
On the other hand one can define an important parameter of density modulation
depth of bunch which is unknown to this day.

introduced in [Graphs Combin. 31(5) (2015), 1453--1462], where the players
Dominator and Staller alternately select vertices of $G$. Each vertex chosen
must strictly increase the number of vertices totally dominated, where a vertex
totally dominates another vertex if they are neighbors. This process eventually
produces a total dominating set $S$ of $G$ in which every vertex is totally
dominated by a vertex in $S$. Dominator wishes to minimize the number of
vertices chosen, while Staller wishes to maximize it. The game total domination
number, $\gamma_{\rm tg}(G)$, of $G$ is the number of vertices chosen when
Dominator starts the game and both players play optimally. Henning, Klav\v{z}ar
and Rall [Combinatorica, to appear] posted the $\frac{3}{4}$-Game Total
Domination Conjecture that states that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices in
which every component contains at least three vertices, then $\gamma_{\rm
tg}(G) \le \frac{3}{4}n$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture over the
class of graphs $G$ that satisfy both the condition that the degree sum of
adjacent vertices in $G$ is at least $4$ and the condition that no two vertices
of degree $1$ are at distance $4$ apart in $G$. In particular, we prove that by
adopting a greedy strategy, Dominator can complete the total domination game
played in a graph with minimum degree at least $2$ in at most $3n/4$ moves.

high spectrum and energy efficiency. To realize its potential performance gain,
accurate channel estimation is essential. However, due to massive number of
antennas at the base station (BS), the pilot overhead required by conventional
channel estimation schemes will be unaffordable, especially for frequency
division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO. To overcome this problem, we propose a
structured compressive sensing (SCS)-based spatio-temporal joint channel
estimation scheme to reduce the required pilot overhead, whereby the
spatio-temporal common sparsity of delay-domain MIMO channels is leveraged.
Particularly, we first propose the non-orthogonal pilots at the BS under the
framework of CS theory to reduce the required pilot overhead. Then, an adaptive
structured subspace pursuit (ASSP) algorithm at the user is proposed to jointly
estimate channels associated with multiple OFDM symbols from the limited number
of pilots, whereby the spatio-temporal common sparsity of MIMO channels is
exploited to improve the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, by exploiting
the temporal channel correlation, we propose a space-time adaptive pilot scheme
to further reduce the pilot overhead. Additionally, we discuss the proposed
channel estimation scheme in multi-cell scenario. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate channels with the
reduced pilot overhead, and it is capable of approaching the optimal oracle
least squares estimator.

placement by building the virtual world on top of a 3D scan of the real world.
Through the association between the real and virtual world, users are able to
walk freely while wearing a head-mounted device, avoid obstacles like walls and
furniture, and interact with people and objects. Most current virtual reality

exponent $H$. Considering the realisations of these three processes as time
series, they might be described by their statistical features, such as half of
the ratio of the mean square successive difference to the variance,
$\mathcal{A}$, and the number of turning points, $T$. This paper investigates
the relationships between $\mathcal{A}$ and $H$, and between $T$ and $H$. It is
found numerically that the formulae $\mathcal{A}(H)=a{\rm e}^{bH}$ in case of
fBm, and $\mathcal{A}(H)=a+bH^c$ for fGn and DfGn, describe well the
$\mathcal{A}(H)$ relationship. When $T(H)$ is considered, no simple formula is
found, and it is empirically found that among polynomials, the fourth and
second order description applies best. The most relevant finding is that when
plotted in the space of $(\mathcal{A},T)$, the three process types form
separate branches. Hence, it is examined whether $\mathcal{A}$ and $T$ may
serve as Hurst exponent indicators. Some real world data (stock market indices,
sunspot numbers, chaotic time series) are analyzed for this purpose, and it is
found that the $H$'s estimated using the $H(\mathcal{A})$ relations (expressed
as inverted $\mathcal{A}(H)$ functions) are consistent with the $H$'s extracted
with the well known wavelet approach. This allows to efficiently estimate the
Hurst exponent based on fast and easy to compute $\mathcal{A}$ and $T$, given
that the process type: fBm, fGn or DfGn, is correctly classified beforehand.
Finally, it is suggested that the $\mathcal{A}(H)$ relation for fGn and DfGn
might be an exact (shifted) $3/2$ power-law.

themselves are mounted rigidly in a polymeric extracellular matrix, fixing the

plane, with axis of symmetry in the swimming direction, but with a roughly 15
degree azimuthal offset which results in the eponymous rotation of the colonies
about a body-fixed axis. Experiments on colonies held stationary on a
micropipette show that the beating pattern takes the form of a symplectic
metachronal wave (Brumley et al. (2012)). Here we extend the Lighthill/Blake
axisymmetric, Stokes-flow model of a free-swimming spherical squirmer
(Lighthill (1952), Blake (1971b)) to include azimuthal swirl. The measured
kinematics of the metachronal wave for 60 different colonies are used to
calculate the coefficients in the eigenfunction expansions and hence predict
the mean swimming speeds and rotation rates, proportional to the square of the
beating amplitude, as functions of colony radius. As a test of the squirmer
model, the results are compared with measurements (Drescher et al. (2009)) of

with radius is qualitatively correct, but the model underestimates both the

implications of gravitational radiation for the large-scale structure of the
universe, we consider its coupling to density perturbations during the
post-recombination era. We do so by assuming an Einstein-de Sitter background
cosmology and by employing a second-order perturbation study. At this
perturbative level and on superhorizon scales, we find that gravitational
radiation adds a distinct and faster growing mode to the standard linear
solution for the density contrast. Given the expected weakness of cosmological
gravitational waves, however, the effect of the new mode is currently
subdominant and it could start becoming noticeable only in the far future.
Nevertheless, this still raises the intriguing possibility that the late-time

atoms are predicted to sit midway between two S atoms, in a structure with
$Im\bar3m$ symmetry. At lower pressures the H atoms move to an off-center
position forming a short H$-$S covalent bond and a longer H$\cdots$S hydrogen
bond, in a structure with $R3m$ symmetry. X-ray diffraction experiments
confirmed the H$_3$S stoichiometry and the S lattice sites, but were unable to
discriminate between the two phases. Our present ab initio density-functional
theory (DFT) calculations show that the quantum nuclear motion lowers the
symmetrization pressure by 72 GPa. Consequently, we predict that the $Im\bar3m$
phase is stable over the whole pressure range within which a high $T_c$ was
measured. The observed pressure-dependence of $T_c$ is closely reproduced in
our calculations for the $Im\bar3m$ phase, but not for the $R3m$ phase. Thus,
the quantum nature of the proton completely rules the superconducting phase
diagram of H$_3$S.

numerically on the surface of the sphere in order to generate optimally
transported (OT) meshes, equidistributed with respect to a monitor function.
Optimal transport generates meshes that keep the same connectivity as the
original mesh, making them suitable for r-adaptive simulations, in which the
equations of motion can be solved in a moving frame of reference in order to
avoid mapping the solution between old and new meshes and to avoid load
balancing problems on parallel computers.
  The semi-implicit solution of the Monge-Amp\`ere type equation involves a new
linearisation of the Hessian term, and exponential maps are used to map from
old to new meshes on the sphere. The determinant of the Hessian is evaluated as
the change in volume between old and new mesh cells, rather than using
numerical approximations to the gradients.
  OT meshes are generated to compare with centroidal Voronoi tesselations on
the sphere and are found to have advantages and disadvantages; OT
equidistribution is more accurate, the number of iterations to convergence is
independent of the mesh size, face skewness is reduced and the connectivity
does not change. However anisotropy is higher and the OT meshes are
non-orthogonal.
  It is shown that optimal transport on the sphere leads to meshes that do not
tangle. However, tangling can be introduced by numerical errors in calculating
the gradient of the mesh potential. Methods for alleviating this problem are
explored.
  Finally, OT meshes are generated using observed precipitation as a monitor
function, in order to demonstrate the potential power of the technique.

achieve high temporal multimode storage, without sacrificing memory efficiency.
However, previous demonstrations have been hampered by the difficulty of
creating high-resolution atomic combs, which reduces the efficiency for
multimode storage. In this article we present a comb preparation method that
allows one to increase the multimode capacity for a fixed memory bandwidth. We
apply the method to a $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$-doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal, in which we

perspective. The central question in this geometric context is, which
conditions on the k-dimensional facets of an n-simplex S guarantee that S has
no obtuse dihedral angles. First we study the properties of an n-simplex S
whose k-facets are all nonobtuse, and generalize some classical results by
Fiedler. We prove that if all (n-1)-facets of an n-simplex S are nonobtuse,
each makes at most one obtuse dihedral angle with another facet. This helps to
identify a special type of tetrahedron, which we will call sub-orthocentric,
with the property that if all tetrahedral facets of S are sub-orthocentric,
then S is nonobtuse. Rephrased in the language of linear algebra, this
constitutes a purely geometric proof of the fact that each symmetric
ultrametric matrix is the inverse of a weakly diagonally dominant M-matrix.
  Review papers support our belief that the linear algebraic perspective on the
inverse M-matrix problem dominates the literature. The geometric perspective
however connects sign properties of entries of inverses of a symmetric positive
definite matrix to the dihedral angle properties of an underlying simplex, and
enables an explicit visualization of how these angles and signs can be
manipulated. This will serve to formulate purely geometric conditions on the
k-facets of an n-simplex S that may render S nonobtuse also for k>3. For this,
we generalize the class of sub-orthocentric tetrahedra that gives rise to the
class of ultrametric matrices, to sub-orthocentric simplices that define
symmetric positive definite matrices A with special types of k x k principal
submatrices for k>3. Each sub-orthocentric simplices is nonobtuse, and we
conjecture that any simplex with sub-orthocentric facets only, is
sub-orthocentric itself.

in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Such states define a computational
basis, and permit a perfect equivalence between continuous and discrete
universal operations. The drawback of this encoding is that the corresponding
logical states are unphysical, meaning infinitely localized in phase space. We
use the modular variables formalism to show that, in a number of protocols
relevant for quantum information and for the realization of fundamental tests
of quantum mechanics, it is possible to loosen the requirements on the logical
subspace without jeopardizing their usefulness or their successful

modular observables that permit the readout of the encoded discrete quantum
information from the corresponding logical states. Finally, we demonstrate the
experimental feasibility of our approach by applying it to the transverse
degrees of freedom of single photons.

susceptibility per site (DFSS), associated with the qubit under a periodic
driving of the transverse field term of environment across its critical point

analytically investigate the effect of system-environment coupling strength on
the EEs and DFSS and relate the behavior of DFSS to EEs as a function of
frequency by plausible analytical arguments. We explicitly show that the
low-frequency beating like pattern of DFSS is an outcome of two frequencies,
causing the oscillations in the two branches of EEs, that are dependent on the
coupling strength. In the intermediate frequency regime, dip structure observed
in DFSS can be justified by the resonance peaks of EEs at those coupling
parameter dependent frequencies; high frequency saturation value of EEs and

However, currently, the computationally expensive segments of the learning
pipeline, such as feature extraction and model training, are offloaded to the

computing resources available on mobile platforms. In this paper, we show that
by combining the computing power distributed over a number of phones, judicious
optimization choices, and contextual information it is possible to execute the
end-to-end pipeline entirely on the phones at the edge of the network,
efficiently. We also show that by harnessing the power of this combination, it

vectorization, and image clustering -- on a set of mobile phones. Our results
show a 75% improvement over the standard, full pipeline implementation running
on the phones without modification -- reducing the time to one minute under

fully distributed, infrastructure-less computing is possible on networks of

sizes between $m$ and $l$, and such that it contains exactly $k$ subsets of
size $i$ for each $m \leq i \leq l$? The answer, which we denote by $g_n(m,l)$,
gives a lower estimate for the width of a cutset between levels $m$ and $l$ in
$2^{[n]}$. After using the Kruskal-Katona Theorem to give a general
characterization of cutsets in terms of the number and sizes of their elements,
we find lower and upper bounds (as well as some exact values) for $g_n(m,l)$.

synchrotron emission has been also proposed to be present in a handful of these

spectral indices at centimeter wavelengths. In one case (the HH 80-81 jet
arising from a massive protostar), its synchrotron nature was confirmed by the
detection of linearly polarized radio emission. One of the main consequences of
these results is that synchrotron emission implies the presence of relativistic
particles among the non-relativistic material of these jets. Therefore, an
acceleration mechanism should be taking place. The most probable scenario is
that particles are accelerated when the jets strongly impact against the dense
envelope surrounding the protostar. Here, we present an analysis of radio
observations obtained with the Very Large Array of the Triple Radio Source in
the Serpens star-forming region. This object is known to be a radio jet arising
from an intermediate-mass protostar. It is also one of the first protostellar

$N(n,|R|,t)$ points is called tight. In Part II of this paper we construct
tight Euclidean designs for $n=2$ and every $t$ and $|R|$ with $|R| \leq

machine learning etc. to group a collection of objects into similar groups with
respect to a similarity (or dissimilarity) measure. Among the clustering
problems, specifically \textit{$k$-means} clustering has got much attention
from the researchers. Despite the fact that $k$-means is a very well studied
problem its status in the plane is still an open problem. In particular, it is
unknown whether it admits a PTAS in the plane. The best known approximation
bound in polynomial time is $9+\eps$.
  In this paper, we consider the following variant of $k$-means. Given a set
$C$ of points in $\mathcal{R}^d$ and a real $f > 0$, find a finite set $F$ of
points in $\mathcal{R}^d$ that minimizes the quantity $f*|F|+\sum_{p\in C}
\min_{q \in F} {||p-q||}^2$. For any fixed dimension $d$, we design a local
search PTAS for this problem. We also give a ""bi-criterion"" local search
algorithm for $k$-means which uses $(1+\eps)k$ centers and yields a solution
whose cost is at most $(1+\eps)$ times the cost of an optimal $k$-means
solution. The algorithm runs in polynomial time for any fixed dimension.
  The contribution of this paper is two fold. On the one hand, we are being
able to handle the square of distances in an elegant manner, which yields near
optimal approximation bound. This leads us towards a better understanding of
the $k$-means problem. On the other hand, our analysis of local search might
also be useful for other geometric problems. This is important considering that
very little is known about the local search method for geometric approximation.

environmental differences across L1688. The kinematic properties of the dense
gas traced by the N2H+ and N2D+ (1-0) lines are also discussed.
  Methods. RD has been measured via observations of the J=1-0 transition of
N2H+ and N2D+ toward 33 dense cores in different regions of L1688. fd estimates
have been done using C17O(1-0) and 850 micron dust continuum emission from the
SCUBA survey. All line observations were carried out with the IRAM 30 meter
antenna.
  Results. The dense cores show large (2-40%) deuterium fractions, with
significant variations between the sub-regions of L1688. The CO-depletion
factor also varies from one region to another (1-7). Two different correlations
are found between deuterium fraction and CO-depletion factor: cores in regions
A, B2 and I show increasing RD with increasing fd, similar to previous studies
of deuterium fraction in pre-stellar cores; cores in regions B1, B1B2, C, E, F
and H show a steeper RD-fd correlation, with large deuterium fractions
occurring in fairly quiescent gas with relatively low CO freeze-out factors.
These are probably recently formed, centrally concentrated starless cores which
have not yet started the contraction phase toward protostellar formation. We
also find that the deuterium fraction is affected by the amount of turbulence,
dust temperature and distance from heating sources in all regions of L1688,
although no clear trend is found.

state disturbance and the faithfulness of the measurement outcome in a model
describing a spin-1/2 particle protectively measured by an inhomogeneous
magnetic field. We determine constraints on the experimentally required field
strengths from bounds imposed on the allowable state disturbance. We also
demonstrate that the protective measurement may produce an incorrect result
even when the particle's spin state is unaffected by the measurement, and show
that successive measurements using multiple magnetic fields produce the same
state disturbance as a single measurement involving a superposition of these

of our ability to accurately measure properties of transiting exoplanets in the
presence of stellar activity. Here we insert transits of a hot Jupiter into
continuous disk integrated data of the Sun in Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) from
NASA's SDO/EVE instrument to assess the impact of stellar activity on the
measured planet-to-star radius ratio
$(\textrm{R}_\textrm{p}/\textrm{R}_\star)$. In 75% of our simulated light
curves we measure the correct radius ratio; however, incorrect values can be
measured if there is significant short term variability in the light curve. The
maximum measured value of $(\textrm{R}_\textrm{p}/\textrm{R}_\star)$ is $50\%$
larger than the input value, which is much smaller than the large Ly$\alpha$
transit depths that have been reported in the literature, suggesting that for
stars with activity levels comparable to the Sun, stellar activity alone cannot
account for these deep transits. We ran simulations without a transit and found
that stellar activity cannot mimic the Ly$\alpha$ transit of 55 Cancari b,
strengthening the conclusion that this planet has a partially transiting
exopshere. We were able to compare our simulations to more active stars by
artificially increasing the variability in the Solar Ly$\alpha$ light curve. In
the higher variability data, the largest value of
$(\textrm{R}_\textrm{p}/\textrm{R}_\star)$ we measured is < 3x the input value
which again is not large enough to reproduce the Ly$\alpha$ transit depth
reported for the more active stars HD 189733 and GJ 436, supporting the
interpretation that these planets have extended atmospheres and possible
cometary tails.

spherical symmetry. Our initially stable models are driven to collapse by the
addition of one of two things: an initially in-going velocity profile, or a
shell of minimally coupled, massless scalar field that falls onto the star.
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) solutions with an initially isentropic,
gamma-law equation of state serve as our NS models. The initial values of the
velocity profile's amplitude and the star's central density span a parameter
space which we have surveyed extensively and which we find provides a rich
picture of the possible end states of NS collapse. This parameter space survey
elucidates the boundary between Type I and Type II critical behavior in perfect
fluids which coincides, on the subcritical side, with the boundary between
dispersed and bound end states. For our particular model, initial velocity
amplitudes greater than 0.3c are needed to probe the regime where arbitrarily
small black holes can form. In addition, we investigate Type I behavior in our
system by varying the initial amplitude of the initially imploding scalar
field. In this case we find that the Type I critical solutions resemble TOV
solutions on the 1-mode unstable branch of equilibrium solutions, and that the
critical solutions' frequencies agree well with the fundamental mode
frequencies of the unstable equilibria. Additionally, the critical solution's
scaling exponent is shown to be well approximated by a linear function of the
initial star's central density.

strong uneven bond contractions at intermediate pressures where we found
coexistence of octahedral and rhombohedral superexchange angle distortions. We

deuteron, $^3$H, and $^3$He nuclei generated by the one-meson exchange CP-odd
nuclear force in the standard model. The effective $|\Delta S| = 1$ four-quark
operators are matched to the $|\Delta S| = 1$ standard model processes
involving the CP phase of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix at the
electroweak scale and run down to the hadronic scale $\mu = 1$ GeV according to
the renormalization group evolution in the next-to-leading logarithmic order.
At the hadronic scale, the hadron matrix elements are modeled in the
factorization approach. We then obtain the one-meson (pion, eta meson, and
kaon) exchange CP-odd nuclear force, which is the combination of the $|\Delta
S| = 1$ meson-baryon vertices which issue from the penguin operator and the
hyperon-nucleon transition. From this CP-odd nuclear force, the nuclear EDM is
calculated with the realistic Argonne $v18$ interaction and the CP-odd nuclear
force using the Gaussian expansion method. It is found that the EDMs of light
nuclear systems are of order $O(10^{-31}) e $ cm. We also estimate the standard
model contribution to other hadronic CP violating observables such as the EDMs
of $^6$Li, $^9$Be nuclei, and the atomic EDMs of $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg,
$^{211}$Rn, and $^{225}$Ra generated through the nuclear Schiff moment. We then

frequencies each orbital cycle of $\approx$ 26.5 d and a superorbital
modulation with a period of $\approx$ 4.6 yr. We have performed a detailed
study of the low-frequency radio emission of LS I +61 303 by analysing all the
archival GMRT data at 150, 235 and 610 MHz, and conducting regular LOFAR
observations within the Radio Sky Monitor (RSM) at 150 MHz. We have detected
the source for the first time at 150 MHz, which is also the first detection of
a gamma-ray binary at such a low frequency. We have obtained the light-curves
of the source at 150, 235 and 610 MHz, all of them showing orbital modulation.
The light-curves at 235 and 610 MHz also show the existence of superorbital
variability. A comparison with contemporaneous 15-GHz data shows remarkable
differences with these light-curves. At 15 GHz we see clear outbursts, whereas
at low frequencies we see variability with wide maxima. The light-curve at 235
MHz seems to be anticorrelated with the one at 610 MHz, implying a shift of
$\sim$ 0.5 orbital phases in the maxima. We model the shifts between the maxima
at different frequencies as due to changes in the physical parameters of the
emitting region assuming either free-free absorption or synchrotron
self-absorption, obtaining expansion velocities for this region close to the
stellar wind velocity with both mechanisms.

combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations are revealed to follow from general
categorical constructions and universal properties. Rather than beginning with
an equation inside a given Hopf algebra and referring to given Hochschild
$1$-cocycles, our starting point is an abstract fixpoint equation in groupoids,
shown canonically to generate all the algebraic structure. Precisely, for any
finitary polynomial endofunctor $P$ defined over groupoids, the system of
combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations $X=1+P(X)$ has a universal solution,
namely the groupoid of $P$-trees. The isoclasses of $P$-trees generate
naturally a Connes-Kreimer-like bialgebra, in which the abstract
Dyson-Schwinger equation can be internalised in terms of canonical
$B_+$-operators. The solution to this equation is a series (the Green function)
which always enjoys a Fa\`a di Bruno formula, and hence generates a
sub-bialgebra isomorphic to the Fa\`a di Bruno bialgebra. Varying $P$ yields
different bialgebras, and cartesian natural transformations between various $P$
yield bialgebra homomorphisms and sub-bialgebras, corresponding for example to
truncation of Dyson-Schwinger equations. Finally, all constructions can be
pushed inside the classical Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of trees by the
operation of taking core of $P$-trees. A byproduct of the theory is an
interpretation of combinatorial Green functions as inductive data types in the
sense of Martin-L\""of Type Theory (expounded elsewhere).

significant limitation for use of the millimeter-wave bands for cellular

change rapidly, causing links between devices and access points to switch among
line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight and outage states. We propose using Random
Linear Network Coding to overcome the unreliability of individual communication
links in such millimeter-wave systems. Our system consists of devices
transmitting and receiving network-coded packets through several access points.
For downlink communication, network-coded packets are transmitted to a device
via multiple access points. For uplink communication, the access points perform
network coding of packets of several devices, and then send the network-coded
packets to the core network. We compare our approach against a naive approach
in which non-network coded packets are transmitted via multiple access points

outperforms the forwarding approach. In particular, network coding greatly
improves the efficiency of the air-interface transmissions and the efficiency

the analog processing network is usually based on variable phase shifters. In
this paper, we propose hybrid architectures based on switching networks to
reduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on
phase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the
energy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we
propose an open loop compressive channel estimation technique which is
independent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage. We analyze the
performance of the new estimation algorithm for hybrid architectures based on
phase shifters and switches. Using the estimated, we develop two algorithms for
the design of the hybrid combiner based on switches and analyze the achieved
spectral efficiency. Finally, we study the trade-offs between power
consumption, hardware complexity, and spectral efficiency for hybrid
architectures based on phase shifting networks and switching networks.
Numerical results show that architectures based on switches obtain equal or
better channel estimation performance to that obtained using phase shifters,
while reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. For equal power
consumption, all the hybrid architectures provide similar spectral
efficiencies.

  Analysis",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDT) are widely used in industry
to evaluate materials' long term properties. Even though there has been
tremendous statistical research in nonparametric methods, the current
industrial practice is still to use application-specific parametric models to
describe ADDT data. The challenge of using a nonparametric approach comes from
the need to retain the physical meaning of degradation mechanisms and also
perform extrapolation for predictions at the use condition. Motivated by this
challenge, we propose a semi-parametric model to describe ADDT data. We use
monotonic B-splines to model the degradation path, which not only provides
flexible models with few assumptions, but also retains the physical meaning of
degradation mechanisms (e.g., the degradation path is monotonically
decreasing). Parametric models, such as the Arrhenius model, are used for
modeling the relationship between the degradation and accelerating variable,
allowing for extrapolation to the use conditions. We develop an efficient
procedure to estimate model parameters. We also use simulation to validate the
developed procedures and demonstrate the robustness of the semi-parametric
model under model misspecification. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated
by multiple industrial applications.

called a 0/1-simplex. It is nonobtuse if none its dihedral angles is obtuse,
and acute if additionally none of them is right. In terms of linear algebra,
acute 0/1-simplices in Cn can be described by nonsingular 0/1-matrices P of
size n x n whose Gramians have an inverse that is strictly diagonally dominant,
with negative off-diagonal entries.
  The first part of this paper deals with giving a detailed description of how
to efficiently compute, by means of a computer program, a representative from
each orbit of an acute 0/1-simplex under the action of the hyperoctahedral
group Bn of symmetries of Cn. A side product of the investigations is a simple
code that computes the cycle index of Bn, which can in explicit form only be
found in the literature for n < 7. Using the computed cycle indices in
combination with Polya's theory of enumeration shows that acute 0/1-simplices
are extremely rare among all 0/1-simplices.
  In the second part of the paper, we study the 0/1-matrices that represent the
acute 0/1-simplices that were generated by our code from a mathematical
perspective. One of the patterns observed in the data involves unreduced upper
Hessenberg 0/1-matrices of size n x n, block-partitioned according to certain
integer compositions of n. These patterns will be fully explained using a
so-called One Neighbor Theorem. Additionally, we are able to prove that the
volumes of the corresponding acute simplices are in one-to-one correspondence
with the part of Kepler's Tree of Fractions that enumerates the rationals
between 0 and 1. Another key ingredient in the proofs is the fact that the
Gramians of the unreduced upper Hessenberg matrices involved are strictly
ultrametric matrices.

expand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditional

enhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increases
clustering on scales r <~ 1 Mpc. We performed our calculations with Halotools,

and smooth Calabi-Yau phases as deformations away from the Landau-Ginzburg
Fermat locus in two explicit examples. We match the non-Fermat deformations to
the 4D Higgs mechanism and study the conservation of R-symmetries. The first
example is a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold on an E$_6$ lattice where the R-symmetry
is preserved. Due to a permutation symmetry of blow-up and torus K\""{a}hler
parameters the R-symmetry stays conserved also smooth Calabi-Yau phase. In the
second example the R-symmetry gets broken once we deform to the geometric
$\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_{3,\text{free}}$ orbifold regime.

nonuniversal theories with renormalization group (RG) evolution down to the
electroweak scale, where precision observables are measured. The departure from
universal theories at the electroweak scale is not arbitrary, but dictated by
the universal parameters at the matching scale. But to define oblique

same range in stellar mass (7.5 < logM < 10.5), size (0.5 < R < 3.0 kpc), and
star-formation rate (~1 < SFR < 100). Remarkably, a comparison of the most
commonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-light
radius, UV slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance,
star formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [O III]

significant differences between the populations. This suggests that the
processes and conditions which regulate the escape of Ly-alpha from a z ~ 2
star-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. In particular, the lack
of dependence on the UV slope suggests that Ly-alpha emission is not being
significantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. We develop
a simple model of Ly-alpha emission that connects LAEs to all high-redshift
star forming galaxies where the escape of Ly-alpha depends on the sightline
through the galaxy. Using this model, we find that mean solid angle for
Ly-alpha escape is 2.4+/-0.8 steradians; this value is consistent with those
calculated from other studies.

shows that only half (four out of eight) of the current sample exhibits strong
negative metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients. This is at odds with predictions from
hydrodynamical simulations where such gradients are ubiquitous. In this Letter,
we use high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the
[Fe/H] distribution of galactic haloes. We find that kinematically selected
stellar haloes, including both in-situ and accreted particles, have an oblate

However, the projected median [Fe/H] profiles along the galactic disc minor
axis, typically obtained in observations, are significantly flatter. The median
[Fe/H] values at a given radius are larger for the spherical profiles than for
the minor axis profiles by as much as 0.4 dex within the inner 50 kpc. Similar
results are obtained if only the accreted stellar component is considered
indicating that the differences between spherical and minor axis profiles are
not purely driven by heated disc star particles formed in situ. Our study
highlights the importance of performing careful comparisons between models and
observations of halo [Fe/H] distributions.

Sun should show abundance anomalies due to stellar evolution in helium, carbon
and nitrogen, but not oxygen. Helium is always enhanced, but only by up to ~25%
on average because it becomes inaccessible once it is sequestered in the high
density core as the star leaves the main sequence. However, portions of the
debris associated with the disrupted core of a main sequence star can be
enhanced in helium by factors of 2-3 for debris at a common orbital period.
These helium abundance variations may be a contributor to the observed
diversity of hydrogen and helium line strengths in TDEs. A still more striking
anomaly is the rapid enhancement of nitrogen and the depletion of carbon due to
the CNO cycle -- stars more massive than the Sun quickly show an increase in
their average N/C ratio by factors of 3-10. Because low mass stars evolve
slowly and high mass stars are rare, TDEs showing high N/C will almost all be
due to 1-2Msun stars disrupted on the main sequence. Like helium, portions of
the debris will show still larger changes in C and N, and the anomalies decline
as the star leaves the main sequence. The enhanced [N/C] abundance ratio of

of many physical processes dramatically and in this review we claim that
magnetic reconnection is not an exception. We stress that not only
astrophysical turbulence is ubiquitous, but also magnetic reconnection itself
induces turbulence. Thus turbulence must be accounted for in any realistic
astrophysical reconnection setup. We argue that due to the similarities of MHD
turbulence in relativistic and non-relativistic cases the theory of magnetic
reconnection developed for the non-relativistic case can be extended to the
relativistic case and we provide numerical simulations that support this
conjecture. We also provide quantitative comparisons of the theoretical
predictions and results of numerical experiments, including the situations when
turbulent reconnection is self-driven, i.e. the turbulence in the system is
generated by the reconnection process itself. We show how turbulent
reconnection entails the violation of magnetic flux freezing, the conclusion
that has really far reaching consequences for many realistically turbulent
astrophysical environments. In addition, we consider observational testing of
turbulent reconnection as well as numerous implications of the theory. The
former includes the Sun and solar wind reconnection, while the latter include
the process of reconnection diffusion induced by turbulent reconnection, the
acceleration of energetic particles, bursts of turbulent reconnection related
to black hole sources as well as gamma ray bursts. Finally, we explain why
turbulent reconnection cannot be explained by turbulent resistivity or derived

where the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the
case of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales
for the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot
pass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called
breeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow
samples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass
outflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,
information can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in
part, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship
between the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In
practice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere
of influence of the planet. The measured time variability can be used, in
principle, to constrain the parameters of the system (e.g., the strengths of
the surface magnetic fields).

comparative structural and spectral synthesis analysis of 106 red, massive

classical bulge galaxies according to their photometric characteristics, and
further obeying a specific selection to minimize uncertainties in the analysis

analysis suggests that disks underlying pseudo-bulges typically have larger
exponential scale lengths than bulgeless galaxies, despite similar integral
disk luminosities. Spectral synthesis models of the stellar emission within the
3"" SDSS fiber aperture reveal a clear segregation of bulgeless and pseudo-bulge
galaxies from classical bulges on the luminosity-weighted planes of
age-metallicity and mass-metallicity, though a large dispersion is observed
within the two former classes. The secular growth of pseudo-bulges is also
reflected upon their cumulative stellar mass as a function of time, which is
shallower than that for classical bulges. Such results suggest that the centers
of bulgeless and pseudo-bulge galaxies substantially differ from those of bulgy
galaxies with respect to their SFH and chemical enrichment history, which
likely points to different formation/assembly mechanisms.

form out of Giant Molecular Clouds is still largely an open question.
Increasingly detailed observations of young star clusters and star-forming
molecular clouds and computational studies provide clues about their formation
scenarios and the underlying physical processes involved. This chapter is
focused on reviewing the decade-long studies that attempt to computationally
reproduce the well-observed nearby VYMCs, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster,
R136 and NGC 3603 young cluster, thereby shedding light on birth conditions of
massive star clusters, in general. On this regard, focus is given on direct
N-body modeling of real-sized massive star clusters, with a monolithic
structure and undergoing residual gas expulsion, which have consistently
reproduced the observed characteristics of several VYMCs and also of young star
clusters, in general. The connection of these relatively simplified model
calculations with the structural richness of dense molecular clouds and the
complexity of hydrodynamic calculations of star cluster formation is presented
in detail. Furthermore, the connections of such VYMCs with globular clusters,
which are nearly as old as our Universe, is discussed. The chapter is concluded
by addressing long-term deeply gas-embedded (at least apparently) and
substructured systems like W3 Main. While most of the results are quoted from
existing and up-to-date literature, in an integrated fashion, several new
insights and discussions are provided.

of the fully compressible three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations using
the HYPERION code. The footpoints of the loop magnetic field are advected by
random motions. As a consequence the magnetic field in the loop is energized
and develops turbulent nonlinear dynamics characterized by the continuous
formation and dissipation of field-aligned current sheets: energy is deposited
at small scales where heating occurs. Dissipation is non-uniformly distributed
so that only a fraction of the coronal mass and volume gets heated at any time.
Temperature and density are highly structured at scales which, in the solar
corona, remain observationally unresolved: the plasma of our simulated loop is
multi-thermal, where highly dynamical hotter and cooler plasma strands are
scattered throughout the loop at sub-observational scales. Numerical
simulations of coronal loops of 50000 km length and axial magnetic field
intensities ranging from 0.01 to 0.04 Tesla are presented. To connect these
simulations to observations we use the computed number densities and
temperatures to synthesize the intensities expected in emission lines typically
observed with the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode.
These intensities are used to compute differential emission measure
distributions using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain code, which are very similar
to those derived from observations of solar active regions. We conclude that
coronal heating is found to be strongly intermittent in space and time, with
only small portions of the coronal loop being heated: in fact, at any given
time, most of the corona is cooling down.

show that this prescription predicts a wide variation of local star formation

that the model predicts star formation rates in agreement with observations

This agreement is non-trivial, as the model was not tuned in any way and the
predicted star formation rates on all scales are determined by the distribution

reduced to second-order algebras. We also prove an analogous theorem for the
$(2k+1)$th-order PHA to be reduced to third-order ones. Through these theorems
we find solutions to $P_{IV}$ and $P_V$ given in terms of confluent
hypergeometric functions. For some special cases, those can be classified in
several solution hierarchies. In this way, we find real solutions with real
parameters and complex solutions with real and complex parameters for both
equations.
  Finally, we study the coherent states (CS) for the SUSY partners of the
harmonic oscillator that are connected with $P_{IV}$, which we will call
Painlev\'e IV coherent states. Since these systems have third-order ladder
operators $l_k^\pm$, we seek first the CS as eigenstates of the annihilation
operator $l_k^-$. We also define operators analogous to the displacement
operator and we get CS departing from the extremal states in each subspace in
which the Hilbert space is decomposed. We conclude our treatment applying a
linearization process to the ladder operators in order to define a new
displacement operator to obtain CS involving the entire Hilbert space.

canonical inflation by imposing conditions, not on the potential, but on the
slow-roll parameter $\epsilon(\phi)$ and its derivatives $\epsilon^{\prime

conditions on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the running $n_{sk}$ at
$\phi_{H}$ where the perturbations are produced, some $50$ $-$ $60$ $e$-folds
before the end of inflation. We find quite generally that for models where
$\epsilon(\phi)$ develops a maximum, a relatively large $r$ is most likely
accompanied by a positive running while a negligible tensor-to-scalar ratio
implies negative running. The definitive answer, however, is given in terms of
the slow-roll parameter $\xi_2(\phi)$. To accommodate a large tensor-to-scalar
ratio that meets the limiting values allowed by the Planck data, we study a
non-monotonic $\epsilon(\phi)$ decreasing during most part of inflation. Since
at $\phi_{H}$ the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon(\phi)$ is increasing, we thus
require that $\epsilon(\phi)$ develops a maximum for $\phi > \phi_{H}$ after
which $\epsilon(\phi)$ decrease to small values where most $e$-folds are
produced. The end of inflation might occur trough a hybrid mechanism and a
small field excursion $\Delta\phi_e\equiv |\phi_H-\phi_e |$ is obtained with a
sufficiently thin profile for $\epsilon(\phi)$ which, however, should not
conflict with the second slow-roll parameter $\eta(\phi)$. As a consequence of
this analysis we find bounds for $\Delta \phi_e$, $r_H$ and for the scalar
spectral index $n_{sH}$. Finally we provide examples where these considerations
are explicitly realised.

the dependence of SG's iteration complexity on the distance between the initial

optimal set {multiplied by a logarithmic factor}. Moreover, we show the
advantages of RSG over SG in solving three different families of convex

is shown to converge linearly. (b) For the problems with local quadratic growth

The novelty of our analysis lies at exploiting the lower bound of the

local error bound conditions) to develop the improved convergence of RSG. { We
also develop a practical variant of RSG enjoying faster convergence than the SG

discovery of the smallest exoplanets ($\le$1.2\re) with corresponding transit

contrast with previous investigations that invoked a single white dwarf mass

reproduce the shape and location of the blue turn. This effect alone, however,
does not completely reproduce the observational data - the blue turn retains
some mystery. In this context, we discuss several other potential problems in
the models. These include possible partial mixing of H and He in the atmosphere
of white dwarf stars, the lack of a good physical description of the
collision-induced absorption process and uncertainties in the opacities at low

The substitution of Te for Sb leads to pronounced changes in the electronic
structure, local bonding, phonon density of states (DOS), dispersions, and
phonon lifetimes. Alloying with tellurium shifts the Fermi level upward, near
the top of the valence band, resulting in a strong suppression of
electron-phonon screening, and a large overall stiffening of interatomic
force-constants. The suppression in electron-phonon coupling concomitantly
increases group velocities and suppresses phonon scattering rates, surpassing
the effects of alloy-disorder scattering, and resulting in a surprising
increased lattice thermal conductivity in the alloy. We also identify that the
local bonding environment changes non-uniformly around different atoms, leading
to variable perturbation strengths for different optical phonon branches. The
respective roles of changes in phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes on
the lattice thermal conductivity are quantified. Our results highlight the

related Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) gives rise to a set of first integrals,
and vice versa. From that, and in the context of symplectic and Poisson
manifolds, a deep connection between the HJE and the (non)commutative
integrability notion, and consequently the integrability by quadratures, is
stablished. Moreover, in the same context, we find conditions on the complete
solutions of the HJE that also ensures integrability by quadratures, but they
are weaker than those related to the (non)commutative integrability. Examples
are developed along all the paper in order to illustrate the theoretical
results.

ambient RF sources is considered as a promising technique for wireless charging
of low-power devices. To illustrate the design considerations of RF-based
ambient energy harvesting networks, this article first points out the primary
challenges of implementing and operating such networks, including
non-deterministic energy arrival patterns, energy harvesting mode selection,
energy-aware cooperation among base stations (BSs), etc. A brief overview of
the recent advancements and a summary of their shortcomings are then provided
to highlight existing research gaps and possible future research directions. To
this end, we investigate the feasibility of implementing RF-based ambient
energy harvesting in ultra-dense small cell networks (SCNs) and examine the
related trade-offs in terms of the energy efficiency and
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) outage probability of a typical
user in the downlink. Numerical results demonstrate the significance of
deploying a mixture of on-grid small base stations (SBSs)~(powered by electric
grid) and off-grid SBSs~(powered by energy harvesting) and optimizing their
corresponding proportions as a function of the intensity of active SBSs in the
network.

the present RGW consists of vacuum dominating at $f>10^{11}$Hz and graviton
dominating at $f<10^{11}$Hz, respectively. The gravitons are produced by the
four cosmic transitions, mostly by the inflation-reheating one. We perform
adiabatic regularization to remove vacuum divergences in three schemes: at
present, at the end of inflation, and at horizon-exit, to the 2-nd adiabatic
order for the spectrum, and the 4-th order for energy density and pressure. In
the first scheme a cutoff is needed to remove graviton divergences. We find
that all three schemes yield the spectra of a similar profile, and the
primordial spectrum defined far outside horizon during inflation is practically
unaffected. We also regularize the gauge-invariant perturbed inflaton and the
scalar curvature perturbation by the last two schemes, and find that the scalar
spectra, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the consistency relation remain

new adaptive form of approximate quantum Bayesian inference that is
polynomially faster than its classical analogue and tractable if the quantum

information requires a special Information Retrieval (IR) frameworks to search
and get information accurately and speedily. Currently, keywords-based
techniques are commonly used in information retrieval. However, a major
drawback of the keywords approach is its inability of handling the polysemy and
synonymy phenomenon of the natural language. For instance, the meanings of
words and understanding of concepts differ in different communities. Same word
use for different concepts (polysemy) or use different words for the same
concept (synonymy). Most of information retrieval frameworks have a weakness to
deal with the semantics of the words in term of (indexing, Boolean model,
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) , Latent semantic Index (LSI) and semantic
ranking, etc.). Traditional Arabic Information Retrieval (AIR) models
performance insufficient with semantic queries, which deal with not only the
keywords but also with the context of these keywords. Therefore, there is a
need for a semantic information retrieval model with a semantic index structure
and ranking algorithm based on semantic index.

spectroscopic ellipsometry characterization, the degradation mechanism of

studied. We present evidence that the CH3NH3PbI3 degradation in humid air
proceeds by two competing reactions of (i) the PbI2 formation by the desorption
of CH3NH3I species and (ii) the generation of a CH3NH3PbI3 hydrate phase by H2O
incorporation. In particular, rapid phase change occurs in the near-surface
region and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer thickness reduces rapidly in the initial 1-h
air exposure even at a low relative humidity of 40%. After the prolonged air
exposure, the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is converted completely to hexagonal platelet
PbI2/hydrate crystals that have a distinct atomic-scale multilayer structure
with a period of 0.65 nm. We find that conventional x-ray diffraction and
optical characterization in the visible region, used commonly in earlier works,
are quite insensitive to the surface phase change. Based on results obtained in
this work, we discuss the degradation mechanism of CH3NH3PbI3 in humid air.

the nucleus, have been observed in-situ on all comets since the Giotto mission
flew by comet 1P/Halley in 1986. Yet their formation mechanism remains unknown.
Several solutions have been proposed, from localized physical mechanisms on the
surface/sub-surface (see review in Belton (2010)) to purely dynamical processes
involving the focusing of gas flows by the local topography (Crifo et al.
2002). While the latter seems to be responsible for the larger features, high
resolution imagery has shown that broad streams are composed of many smaller
features (a few meters wide) that connect directly to the nucleus surface. We
monitored these jets at high resolution and over several months to understand
what are the physical processes driving their formation, and how this affects
the surface. Using many images of the same areas with different viewing angles,
we performed a 3-dimensional reconstruction of collimated jets, and linked them
precisely to their sources on the nucleus. Results.We show here observational
evidence that the Northern hemisphere jets of comet 67P arise from areas with
sharp topographic changes and describe the physical processes involved. We
propose a model in which active cliffs are the main source of jet-like
features, and therefore the regions eroding the fastest on comets. We suggest
that this is a common mechanism taking place on all comets.

estimate of the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 2808 using deep IR
data obtained with the multi conjugate adaptive optics system operating at the
Gemini South telescope (GeMS). This exquisite photometry, combined with that
obtained in V and I bands with HST, allowed us the detection of the faint Main
Sequence Knee feature in NGC 2808 colour magnitude diagram. The difference
between this point and the main sequence turn off is a good age estimator and
provides ages with unprecedented accuracy. We found that NGC 2808 has an age of
t=10.9\pm0.7 (intrinsic) \pm0.45 (metallicity term) Gyr. A possible
contamination by He-enhanced population could make the cluster up to 0.25 Gyr
older. Although this age estimate agrees with the age coming from the classical
turn off method (t=11.0 Gyr), its uncertainty is a factor ~3 better, since it
avoids systematics in reddening, distance assumptions and photometric zero
points determination. The final absolute age indicates that NGC 2808 is
slightly younger than other Galactic globular clusters with similar
metallicity.

mapping of the Si IV and C IV emission lines for a high-luminosity quasar at
high redshift. We also cross-correlate the C IV absorption equivalent width
variations with the continuum light curve, in order to estimate the
recombination time lags of the various absorbers and infer the physical
conditions of the ionised gas. We find a reverberation-mapping time lag of
$\sim 900$ rest-frame days for both Si IV and C IV emission lines. This is
consistent with an extension of the BLR size-to-luminosity relation for active
galactic nuclei up to a luminosity of $\sim 10^{48}$ erg/s, and implies a black
hole mass of $10^{10}$ $M_\odot$. Additionally, we measure a recombination time
lag of $\sim 160$ days in the rest frame for the C IV narrow absorption system,
which implies an electron density of the absorbing gas of $\sim 2.5 \cdot 10^4$
cm$^{-3}$. The measured black hole mass of APM 08279+5255 indicates that the
quasar resides in an under-massive host-galaxy bulge with $M_{bulge} \sim 7.5
M_{BH}$, and that the lens magnification is lower than $\sim 8$. Finally, the
inferred electron density of the narrow-line absorber implies a distance of the
order of 10 kpc of the absorbing gas from the quasar, placing it within the
host galaxy.

is comparable to the relevant band-band separation energies. The generalized
theory is presented for a four-band model system without band dispersion, where
analytic formulae are attainable for arbitrary SOC for the relation between the
momentum- and spin-relaxation rates. As an extended description, we also
consider an empirical pseudopotential approximation where SOC is deduced from
the band potential (apart from an empirical scaling constant) and the
spin-relaxation rate can be obtained numerically. Both approaches recover the
usual EY theory for weak SOC and give that the spin-relaxation rate approaches
the momentum-relaxation rate in the limit of strong SOC. We argue that this
limit is realized in gold by analyzing spin relaxation data. A calculation of
the $g$-factor shows that the empirical Elliott-relation, which links the

significant development in tools for functional data analysis (FDA). This kind
of data comes with several challenges: infinite-dimensionality of function
spaces, observation noise, and so on. However, there is another interesting
phenomena that creates problems in FDA. The functional data often comes with
lateral displacements/deformations in curves, a phenomenon which is different
from the height or amplitude variability and is termed phase variation. The
presence of phase variability artificially often inflates data variance, blurs
underlying data structures, and distorts principal components. While the
separation and/or removal of phase from amplitude data is desirable, this is a
difficult problem. In particular, a commonly used alignment procedure, based on
minimizing the $\mathbb{L}^2$ norm between functions, does not provide
satisfactory results. In this paper we motivate the importance of dealing with
the phase variability and summarize several current ideas for separating phase
and amplitude components. These approaches differ in the following: (1) the
definition and mathematical representation of phase variability, (2) the
objective functions that are used in functional data alignment, and (3) the
algorithmic tools for solving estimation/optimization problems. We use simple
examples to illustrate various approaches and to provide useful contrast

assumed that the AP is connected to an external power supply, while the source
does not have an embedded energy supply. But the source could harvest energy
from radio frequency (RF) signals sent by the AP and store it for future
information transmission. We develop a discrete time-switching (DTS) protocol
for the considered WPCN. In the proposed protocol, either energy harvesting
(EH) or information transmission (IT) operation is performed during each
transmission block. Specifically, based on the channel state information (CSI)
between source and AP, the source can determine the minimum energy required for
an outage-free IT operation. If the residual energy of the source is
sufficient, the source will start the IT phase. Otherwise, EH phase is invoked
and the source accumulates the harvested energy. To characterize the
performance of the proposed protocol, we adopt a discrete Markov chain (MC) to
model the energy accumulation process at the source battery. A closed-form
expression for the average throughput of the DTS protocol is derived. Numerical
results validate our theoretical analysis and show that the proposed DTS

exhibit an interesting evolution of their electronic properties, whose main

Phenomena driven by interactions are also observed, but identifying
experimentally systematic trends in their thickness dependence is challenging.
Here, we explore the evolution of gate-induced superconductivity in exfoliated
MoS2 multilayers ranging from bulk-like to individual monolayers. We observe a
clear transition for all the thicknesses down to the ultimate atomic limit,
providing the first demonstration of superconductivity in atomically thin
exfoliated crystals. Additionally, we characterize the superconducting state by
measuring the critical temperature (TC) and magnetic field (BC) in a large
number of multilayer devices, upon decreasing their thickness. The
superconducting properties change smoothly down to bilayers, and a pronounced
reduction in TC and BC is found to occur when going from bilayers to
monolayers, for which we discuss possible microscopic mechanisms. Finding that
gate-induced superconductivity persists in individual monolayers, which form
the basic building blocks of more sophisticated van der Waals heterostructures,
opens new possibilities for the engineering of the electronic properties of

arbitrary distributions on finite outcome spaces, arbitrary sets of `messages',

that for logarithmic loss, optimality is characterized by an elegant condition,

promising technology for future 5G wireless communication systems. To achieve
the theoretical performance gains in massive MIMO systems, accurate channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is crucial. Due to the overwhelming
pilot signaling and channel feedback overhead, however, conventional downlink
channel estimation and uplink channel feedback schemes might not be suitable
for frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. In addition, these
two topics are usually separately considered in the literature. In this paper,
we propose a joint channel training and feedback scheme for FDD massive MIMO
systems. Specifically, we firstly exploit the temporal correlation of
time-varying channels to propose a differential channel training and feedback
scheme, which simultaneously reduces the overhead for downlink training and
uplink feedback. We next propose a structured compressive sampling matching
pursuit (S-CoSaMP) algorithm to acquire a reliable CSIT by exploiting the
structured sparsity of wireless MIMO channels. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme can achieve substantial reduction in the training and
feedback overhead.

be rigorously mapped onto a classical composite spin-chain model, which is
subsequently exactly treated through the transfer-matrix method. The

diverse temperature dependences, which may include a sharp low-temperature peak

evidenced that this anomalous peak originates from massive thermal excitations
from the doubly degenerate ground state towards an excited state with a high

random variables calls for a notion of dependence. Dependence modeling leads to
mathematical and statistical challenges, and recent developments in extremal
dependence concepts have drawn a lot of attention to probability and its
applications in several disciplines. The aim of this paper is to review various
concepts of extremal positive and negative dependence, including several
recently established results, reconstruct their history, link them to
probabilistic optimization problems, and provide a list of open questions in
this area. While the concept of extremal positive dependence is agreed upon for
random vectors of arbitrary dimensions, various notions of extremal negative
dependence arise when more than two random variables are involved. We review
existing popular concepts of extremal negative dependence given in literature
and introduce a novel notion, which in a general sense includes the existing
ones as particular cases. Even if much of the literature on dependence is
focused on positive dependence, we show that negative dependence plays an
equally important role in the solution of many optimization problems. While the
most popular tool used nowadays to model dependence is that of a copula
function, in this paper we use the equivalent concept of a set of
rearrangements. This is not only for historical reasons. Rearrangement
functions describe the relationship between random variables in a completely
deterministic way, allow a deeper understanding of dependence itself, and have
several advantages on the approximation of solutions in a broad class of
optimization problems.

that in LINERs the [NII] and [OI] lines are broader than the [SII] line and
that the [NII]/[SII] flux ratio increases when moving from ground-based to HST
spectra. This effect is more pronounced considering the wings of the lines. Our
interpretation is that, as a result of superior HST spatial resolution, we
isolate a compact region of dense ionized gas in LINERs, located at a typical
distance of about 3 pc and with a gas density of about 10$^4$-10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$,
which we identify with the outer portion of the intermediate line region (ILR).
Instead, we do not observe these kinds of effects in Seyferts; this may be the
result of a stronger dilution from the NLR emission, since the HST slit maps a
larger region in these sources. Alternatively, we argue that the innermost,
higher density component of the ILR is only present in Seyferts, while it is
truncated at larger radii because of the presence of the circumnuclear torus.
The ILR is only visible in its entirety in LINERs because the obscuring torus
is not present in these sources.

XMM-Newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. PSR A's pulse
profile in X-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spin
precession that occurred within the time span of observations. This yields a
constraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentum
axis Delta_A ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radio
data. We confirmed pulsed emission from PSR J0737-3039B (PSR B) in X-rays even

emission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a loss
of pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. We hypothesize that this is
due to the interaction of PSR A's wind with PSR B's magnetosphere and
orbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto PSR B closed field lines.
Finally, the analysis of the full XMM-Newton dataset provided evidences of
orbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shock
scenario between PSR A's wind and PSR B's magnetosphere.

  Aims. We test the impact of data compression on local correlation tracking

several lossy compression methods (quantization, JPEG compression, and a
reduced number of continuum images) on measurements of solar differential
rotation with LCT.
  Methods. We apply the different compression methods to tracked and remapped
continuum intensity maps obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)

the local correlation tracking code FLCT and determine the additional bias and
noise introduced by compression to differential rotation.
  Results. We find that probing differential rotation with LCT is very robust
to lossy data compression when using quantization. Our results are severely
affected by systematic errors of the LCT method and the HMI instrument. The
sensitivity of LCT to systematic errors is a concern for Solar Orbiter.

ribbons, the symmetry of the system is reduced. By constructing effective
Hamiltonians containing the proper symmetry of the ribbon, we find that the
nature of topological states is dependent on the reduced symmetry of the ribbon

discovered two-dimensional topological crystalline insulators composed by IV-VI
monolayers, where we verify that the edge terminations play a major role on the
Dirac crossings. Particularly, we find that some bulk cuts lead to
nonsymmorphic ribbons, even though the bulk material is symmorphic. The
nonsymmorphism yields a new topological protection, where the Dirac cone is
preserved for arbitrary ribbon width. The effective Hamiltonians are in good
agreement with ab initio calculations.

generalise this result for non-abelian track categories. In this paper we solve
this problem for the following important case: Given categories K and C and a

data (in particular the payoff matrix) is known exactly by both players. In a
now famous result, Nash has shown that any such game has an equilibrium in
mixed strategies. This result was later extended to a class of
incomplete-information two-player games by Harsanyi, who assumed that the
payoff matrix is not known exactly but rather represents a random variable that
is governed by a probability distribution known to both players.
  In 2006, Bertsimas and Aghassi proposed a new class of distribution-free
two-player games where the payoff matrix is only known to belong to a given
uncertainty set. This model relaxes the distributional assumptions of
Harsanyi's Bayesian games, and it gives rise to an alternative
distribution-free equilibrium concept.
  In this thesis we present a new model of incomplete information games without
private information in which the players use a distributionally robust
optimization approach to cope with the payoff uncertainty. With some specific
restrictions, we show that our ""Distributionally Robust Game"" constitutes a
true generalization of the three aforementioned finite games (Nash games,
Bayesian Games and Robust Games). Subsequently, we prove that the set of
equilibria of an arbitrary distributionally robust game with specified
ambiguity set can be computed as the component-wise projection of the solution
set of a multi-linear system of equations and inequalities. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of our new model of games and highlight its
importance.

reduced the computation of the asymptotic communication complexity to a convex

term structure. Here we study a multi-curve extension of short rate models
where, in addition to the short rate itself, we introduce short rate spreads.
In particular, we consider a Gaussian factor model where the short rate and the
spreads are second order polynomials of Gaussian factor processes. This leads
to an exponentially quadratic model class that is less well known than the
exponentially affine class. In the latter class the factors enter linearly and
for positivity one considers square root factor processes. While the square
root factors in the affine class have more involved distributions, in the
quadratic class the factors remain Gaussian and this leads to various
advantages, in particular for derivative pricing. After some preliminaries on
martingale modeling in the multi-curve setup, we concentrate on pricing of
linear and optional derivatives. For linear derivatives, we exhibit an
adjustment factor that allows one to pass from pre-crisis single curve values

determine the rate at which molecular clouds form stars -- internal structure
vs. external, environmental influences -- providing a unified picture for the
regulation of star formation in galaxies. In the presence of external pressure,
the pressure gradient set up within a self-gravitating isothermal cloud leads
to a non-uniform density distribution. Thus the local environment of a cloud
influences its internal structure. In the simple equilibrium model, the
fraction of gas at high density in the cloud interior is determined simply by
the cloud surface density, which is itself inherited from the pressure in the
immediate surroundings. This idea is tested using measurements of the
properties of local clouds, which are found to show remarkable agreement with
the simple equilibrium model. The model also naturally predicts the star
formation relation observed on cloud scales and, at the same time, provides a
mapping between this relation and the closer-to-linear molecular star formation
relation measured on larger scales in galaxies. The key is that pressure
regulates not only the molecular content of the ISM but also the cloud surface
density. I provide a straightforward prescription for the pressure regulation
of star formation that can be directly implemented in numerical models.
Predictions for the dense gas fraction and star formation efficiency measured
on large-scales within galaxies are also presented, establishing the basis for
a new picture of star formation regulated by galactic environment.

sampled spatial grid which represents the best search grid for a given sensor
array, it allows to perform a sensitivity analysis of the array and to
characterize its spatial localization accuracy, and it may assist the system
designer in the reconfiguration of the array. Experimental results using both

substantially improved both for high and for low spatial resolution, and that
it is closely related to the proposed power response sensitivity measure.

understanding the fate of the projectile during hypervelocity impacts. In order
to gain insight into the fate of impactor we have carried out a laboratory
programme, covering the velocity range of 0.38 - 3.50 km/s, devoted to
measuring the survivability, fragmentation and final state of the impactor.
Forsterite olivine and synthetic basalt projectiles were fired onto low
porosity (<10%) pure water-ice targets using the University of Kent's Light Gas
Gun (LGG). We developed a novel method to identify impactor fragments which
were found in ejecta and implanted into the target. We applied astronomical
photometry techniques, using the SOURCE EXTRACTOR software, to automatically
measure the dimensions of thousands of fragments. This procedure enabled us to
estimate the implanted mass on the target body, which was found to be a few
percent of the initial mass of the impactor. We calculated an order of
magnitude difference in the energy density of catastrophic disruption, Q*,
between peridot and basalt projectiles. However, we found very similar
behaviour of the size frequency distributions for the hypervelocity shots (>1
km/s). After each shot, we examined the largest peridot fragments with Raman
spectroscopy and no melt or alteration in the final state of the projectile was
observed.

We exploit the notion of ""Audience retention rate"", introduced by mainstream
online content platforms and measuring the popularity of different parts of the
same video content. We first characterize the performance limits of a cache
able to store parts of videos, when the popularity and the audience retention
rate of each video are available to the cache manager. We then relax the
assumption of known popularity and we propose a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache
replacement policy that operates on the first chunks of each video. We
characterize its performance by extending the well-known Che's approximation to

of the fluid ellipsoid is determined by a positive semi-definite quadratic form
of rank $r=1$, 2, or 3, corresponding to the asymptotic degeneration of the

of time-inhomogeneous affine processes on general state spaces. We present a
concise setup for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. For stochastically
continuous affine processes we show that there always exists a c\`adl\`ag
modification. Afterwards we consider the regularity and the semimartingale
property of affine processes. Contrary to the time-homogeneous case,
time-inhomogeneous affine processes are in general neither regular nor
semimartingales and the time-inhomogeneous case raises many new and interesting
questions. Assuming that an affine process is a semimartingale, we show that
even without regularity the parameter functions satisfy generalized Riccati
integral equations. This generalizes an important result for time-homogeneous
affine processes. We also show that stochastically continuous affine
semimartingales are essentially generated by deterministic time-changes of what
we call absolutely continuously affine semimartingales. These processes
generalize time-homogeneous regular affine processes.
  In the second part we consider the class of affine LIBOR market models. We
contribute to this class of models in two ways. First, we modify the original
setup of the affine LIBOR market models in such a way that next to nonnegative
affine processes real-valued affine processes can also be used. Numerical
examples show that this allows for more flexible implied volatility surfaces.
Second, we introduce the class of affine inflation market models, an extension
of the affine LIBOR market models. A calibration example shows that these
models perform very well in fitting market-observed prices of inflation

existing arguments (known to the authors) were based on long and seemingly ad
hoc computations. We present a simple proof, based on Brouwer's fixed point
theorem, for the 2 x 2 case (St{\o}rmer's theorem). For completeness, we also
include another argument (following the classical outline, but highly
streamlined) based on a characterization of extreme self-maps of the Lorentz
cone and on a link - noticed by R. Hildebrand - to the S-lemma, a well-known
fact from control theory and quadratic/semi-definite programming.

compact binary systems in terms of an effective Hamiltonian approach. The
Hamiltonian for moderately eccentric motion of two non-spinning compact objects
in the extreme mass-ratio limit is given in terms of three potentials: $a(v),
\bar{d}(v), q(v)$. By generalizing the first law of mechanics for
(non-spinning) black hole binaries to eccentric orbits, [\prd{\bf92}, 084021
(2015)] recently obtained new expressions for $\bar{d}(v)$ and $q(v)$ in terms
of quantities that can be readily computed using the gravitational self-force
approach. Using these expressions we present a new computation of the EOB
potential $q(v)$ by combining results from two independent numerical self-force
codes. We determine $q(v)$ for inverse binary separations in the range $1/1200
\le v \lesssim 1/6$. Our computation thus provides the first-ever strong-field
results for $q(v)$. We also obtain $\bar{d}(v)$ in our entire domain to a
fractional accuracy of $\gtrsim 10^{-8}$. We find to our results are compatible
with the known post-Newtonian expansions for $\bar{d}(v)$ and $q(v)$ in the
weak field, and agree with previous (less accurate) numerical results for
$\bar{d}(v)$ in the strong field.

studied using perifusion cell cultures, where constantly moving medium over the
immo- bilized cells allows intermittent GnRH delivery. The LH content of the
outgoing medium serves as a readout of the GnRH signaling pathway activation in
the cells. The challenge lies in relating the LH content of the medium leaving
the chamber to the cellular processes producing LH secretion. To investigate
this relation we developed and analyzed a mathematical model consisting of
coupled partial differential equations describing LH secretion in a perifusion
cell culture. We match the mathematical model to three different data sets and
give cellular mechanisms that explain the data. Our model illustrates the
importance of the negative feedback in the signaling pathway and receptor
desensitization. We demonstrate that different LH outcomes in oxytocin and GnRH
stimulations might originate from different receptor dynamics and
concentration. We ana- lyze the model to understand the influence of
parameters, like the velocity of the medium flow or the fraction collection
time, on the LH outcomes. We show that slow velocities lead to high LH
outcomes. Also, we show that fraction collection times, which do not divide the
GnRH pulse period evenly, lead to irregularities in the data. We examine the
influence of the rate of binding and dissociation of GnRH on the GnRH movement
down the chamber. Our model serves as an important tool that can help in the
design of perifusion experiments and the interpretation of results.
