facilitate a significantly higher absorption of laser energy as compared to
flat surfaces. Due to the efficient coupling of the laser energy, highly
energetic electrons are produced, which in turn can emit intense ultrafast
X-ray pulses. In the present work we use full three dimensional PIC simulations
to analyze the behavior of arrays of carbon nanowires $400 nm$ in diameter,
irradiated by a $\lambda_0 = 400 nm$ laser pulse of $60 fs$ duration at FWHM
and a vector potential of $a_0 = 18$. We analyze the ionization dynamics of the
nanowires. We investigate the difference of the ionization strength and
structure between linearly and circularly polarized laser beam. The nanowires
are found to be fully ionized after about 30 laser cycles. Circularly polarized
light reveals a slightly stronger ionization effect.

by rooted phylogenetic networks. Due to biological reasons, those events occur
very rarely, and, thus, networks containing a minimum number of such events,
so-called minimum hybridization networks, are of particular interest for
research. Moreover, to study reticulate evolution, biologist need not only a
subset but all of those networks. To achieve this goal, the less complex
concept of rooted phylogenetic trees can be used as building block. Here, as a
first important step, the trees are disjoint into common parts, so-called
maximum acyclic agreement forests, which can then be turned into minimum
hybridization networks by applying further network building algorithms. In this
paper, we present two modifications of the first non-naive algorithm --- called
allMAAFs --- computing all maximum acyclic agreement forests for two rooted
binary phylogenetic trees on the same set of taxa. By a simulation study, we
indicate that through these modifications the algorithm is on average 8 times
faster than the original algorithm making this algorithm accessible to larger
input trees and, thus, to a wider range of biological problems.

decoupling techniques. However, it has been shown that dynamical decoupling
introduces noise in optical quantum memories based on ensembles of atoms. In
this article a simple model is proposed to calculate the resulting
signal-to-noise ratio, based on intrinsic quantum memory parameters such as the
optical depth of the ensemble. We also characterize several dynamical

and accretion timescales of gas in early-type galaxies. Standard values of the
accretion rate, star formation efficiency and relaxation rate are not
simultaneously consistent with the observed distribution of kinematic
misalignments. To reproduce that distribution, both fast gas depletion ($t_{\rm
dep} <10^8$ yr; e.g. more efficient star formation) and fast gas destruction
(e.g. by active galactic nucleus feedback) can be invoked, but both also
require a high rate of gas-rich mergers ($>1$ Gyr$^{-1}$). Alternatively, the
relaxation of misaligned material could happen over very long timescales
($\simeq100$ dynamical times or $\approx1$-$5$ Gyr). We explore the various
physical processes that could lead to fast gas depletion and/or slow gas
relaxation, and discuss the prospects of using kinematic misalignments to probe
gas-rich accretion processes in the era of large integral-field spectroscopic

mechanics. The field origin is an extension of the gauge freedom for basis
choice in gauge theories to the underlying scalar field. The extension is based
on the idea that the value of a number at one space time point does not
determine the value at another point. This, combined with the description of
mathematical systems as structures of different types, results in the presence
of separate number fields and vector spaces, both as structures, at different
space time locations. Complex number structures and vector spaces at each
location, are scaled by a complex space time dependent scaling factor. The
effect of this scaling factor on several physical and geometric quantities has
been described in other work. Here the emphasis is on quantum mechanics of one
and two particles, their states and properties. Multiparticle states are also
briefly described. The effect shows as a complex, nonunitary, scalar field
connection on a fiber bundle description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.
The lack of physical evidence for the presence of this field so far means that
the coupling constant of this field to fermions is very small. It also means
that the gradient of the field must be very small in a local region of
cosmological space and time. Outside this region there are no restrictions on

  simulating Panini","16th World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok June 28th - July 02 2015",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  About 1115 rules in Astadhyayi from A.4.1.76 to A.5.4.160 deal with
generation of derivative nouns, making it one of the largest topical sections
in Astadhyayi, called as the Taddhita section owing to the head rule A.4.1.76.
This section is a systematic arrangement of rules that enumerates various
affixes that are used in the derivation under specific semantic relations. We
propose a system that automates the process of generation of derivative nouns
as per the rules in Astadhyayi. The proposed system follows a completely object
oriented approach, that models each rule as a class of its own and then groups
them as rule groups. The rule groups are decided on the basis of selective
grouping of rules by virtue of anuvrtti. The grouping of rules results in an
inheritance network of rules which is a directed acyclic graph. Every rule
group has a head rule and the head rule notifies all the direct member rules of
the group about the environment which contains all the details about data
entities, participating in the derivation process. The system implements this
mechanism using multilevel inheritance and observer design patterns. The system
focuses not only on generation of the desired final form, but also on the
correctness of sequence of rules applied to make sure that the derivation has
taken place in strict adherence to Astadhyayi. The proposed system's design
allows to incorporate various conflict resolution methods mentioned in
authentic texts and hence the effectiveness of those rules can be validated
with the results from the system. We also present cases where we have checked
the applicability of the system with the rules which are not specifically
applicable to derivation of derivative nouns, in order to see the effectiveness
of the proposed schema as a generic system for modeling Astadhyayi.

with cubic crystal symmetry. This one-to-one correspondence is exploited to
define a symmetry classification for triplet $M$-point density waves using the
standard classification of spin-orbit coupled electronic liquid crystal phases
of a cubic crystal. Through this classification we naturally identify a set of
non-coplanar spin density and spin-current density waves: the chiral spin
density wave and its time-reversal invariant analog. These can be thought of as
$3D$ $L=2$ and $L=4$ spin-orbit coupled isotropic $\beta$-phase orders. In
contrast, uniaxial spin density waves are shown to correspond to
$\alpha$-phases. The non-coplanar triple-$M$ spin-current density wave realizes
a novel $2D$ semimetal state with three flavors of four-component spin-momentum
locked Dirac cones, protected by a crystal symmetry akin to non-symmorphic
symmetry, and sits at the boundary between a trivial and topological insulator.
In addition, we point out that a special class of classical spin states,
defined as classical spin states respecting all lattice symmetries up to global
spin rotation, are naturally obtained from the symmetry classification of
electronic triplet density waves. These symmetric classical spin states are the
classical long-range ordered limits of chiral spin liquids.

modular. The analysis is based on the simultaneous fit in the uv-plane of
observations at several wavelengths with a model for the disk thermal emission
and for the dust opacity. The observed flux density at the different
wavelengths is fitted by posing constraints on the disk structure and on the
radial variation of the grain size distribution. We apply the analysis to
observations of three protoplanetary disks (AS 209, FT Tau, DR Tau) for which a
combination of spatially resolved observations in the range ~0.88mm to ~10mm is
available (from SMA, CARMA, and VLA), finding evidence of a decreasing maximum

data representation, which will be harder to understand by humans and to be
consumed by Linked data applications. In this technical report, we propose
TermPicker: a novel approach for vocabulary reuse by recommending RDF types and
properties based on exploiting the information on how other data providers on
the LOD cloud use RDF types and properties to describe their data. To this end,
we introduce the notion of so-called schema-level patterns (SLPs). They capture
how sets of RDF types are connected via sets of properties within some data
collection, e.g., within a dataset on the LOD cloud. TermPicker uses such SLPs
and generates a ranked list of vocabulary terms for reuse. The lists of
recommended terms are ordered by a ranking model which is computed using the
machine learning approach Learning To Rank (L2R). TermPicker is evaluated based
on the recommendation quality that is measured using the Mean Average Precision
(MAP) and the Mean Reciprocal Rank at the first five positions (MRR@5). Our
results illustrate an improvement of the recommendation quality by 29% - 36%
when using SLPs compared to the beforehand investigated baselines of
recommending solely popular vocabulary terms or terms from the same vocabulary.
The overall best results are achieved using SLPs in conjunction with the
Learning To Rank algorithm Random Forests.

the finiteness of associated primes of local cohomology modules for the ring of

attention for fifth generation (5G) cellular communication as they offer orders
of magnitude greater bandwidth than current cellular systems. However, the
medium access control (MAC) layer may need to be significantly redesigned to
support the highly directional transmissions, ultra-low latencies and high peak
rates expected in mmWave communication. To address these challenges, we present
a novel mmWave MAC layer frame structure with a number of enhancements
including flexible, highly granular transmission times, dynamic control signal
locations, extended messaging and ability to efficiently multiplex directional
control signals. Analytic formulae are derived for the utilization and control
overhead as a function of control periodicity, number of users, traffic
statistics, signal-to-noise ratio and antenna gains. Importantly, the analysis
can incorporate various front-end MIMO capability assumptions -- a critical
feature of mmWave. Under realistic system and traffic assumptions, the analysis
reveals that the proposed flexible frame structure design offers significant
benefits over designs with fixed frame structures similar to current 4G
long-term evolution (LTE). It is also shown that fully digital beamforming
architectures offer significantly lower overhead compared to analog and hybrid
beamforming under equivalent power budgets.

strong interior magnetic fields (of order 1 MG or more) as a possible cause of
such large radii. Whether fields of that strength could in principle by
generated by dynamo action in these objects is unclear, and we do not address
the matter directly. Instead, we examine whether such fields could remain in
the interior of a low mass object for a significant time, and whether they
would have any other obvious signatures. First, we estimate timescales for the
loss of strong fields by magnetic buoyancy instabilities. We consider a range
of field strengths and simple morphologies, including both idealized flux tubes
and smooth layers of field. We confirm some of our analytical estimates using
thin flux tube magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the rise of buoyant
fields in a fully-convective M-dwarf. Separately, we consider the Ohmic
dissipation of such fields. We find that dissipation provides a complementary
constraint to buoyancy: while small-scale, fibril fields might be regenerated
faster than they rise, the dissipative heating associated with such fields
would in some cases greatly exceed the luminosity of the star. We show how
these constraints combine to yield limits on the internal field strength and
morphology in low-mass stars. In particular, we find that for stars of 0.3
solar masses, no fields in flux tubes stronger than about 800 kG are
simultaneously consistent with both constraints.

thermalization is in general a good approximation, and also show that the

In
particular we consider dynamical evolution of known planetary systems resulting
from an additional hypothetical planet on an eccentric orbit. We start with an
analytical study of a general two-planet system, showing that a planet on an
elliptical orbit transfers all of its eccentricity to an initially circular
planet if the two planets have comparable orbital angular momenta. Application
to the single Super-Earth system HD38858 shows that an additional hypothetical
planet below current radial velocity (RV) constraints with
{\textit{Msini}}=3-10M$_\oplus$, semi-major axis 1-10au and eccentricity
0.2-0.8 is unlikely to be present from the eccentricity that would be excited
in the known planet (albeit cyclically). However, additional planets in
proximity to the known planet could stabilise the system against secular
perturbations from outer planets. Moreover these additional planets can have an
{\textit{Msini}} below RV sensitivity and still affect their neighbours. For
example, application to the two Super-Earth system 61Vir shows that an
additional hypothetical planet cannot excite high eccentricities in the known
planets, unless its mass and orbit lie in a restricted area of parameter space.
Inner planets in HD38858 below RV sensitivity would also modify conclusions
above about excluded parameter space. This suggests that it may be possible to
infer the presence of additional stabilising planets in systems with an
eccentric outer planet and an inner planet on an otherwise suspiciously
circular orbit. This reinforces the point that the full complement of planets
in a system is needed to assess its dynamical state.

paper \cite{Yazadjiev2014} (Yazadjiev et al. (2014)). The authors of
\cite{Capozziello2015} claim that these differences come from the fact that
they are using the physical Jordan frame while we are working in the Einstein
frame. The results in \cite{Yazadjiev2014} are very well tested by two
numerical codes using different formulations of the field equations that give
us the confidence that they are correct. Thus we decided to perform an
additional test. Namely, we derive the relevant set of field equations in the
Jordan frame and solve them numerically in order to disprove the claim in
\cite{Capozziello2015} that the difference comes from the use of different
frame. The obtained results are in perfect agreement with our previous work
\cite{Yazadjiev2014} and therefore the numerical results in
\cite{Capozziello2015} seem to be incorrect. At the end we point out several
possible sources of error in \cite{Capozziello2015} that can lead to the
observed large deviations.

treatment in numerical simulations is necessarily approximate, requiring
subgrid prescriptions due to the dynamical range involved in the calculations.
We present a suite of SPH simulations designed to showcase the importance of
the choice of a particular subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. We
concentrate on two approaches to treating wide-angle AGN outflows: thermal
feedback, where thermal and kinetic energy is injected into the gas surrounding
the SMBH particle, and virtual particle feedback, where energy is carried by
tracer particles radially away from the AGN. We show that the latter model
produces a far more complex structure around the SMBH, which we argue is a more
physically correct outcome. We suggest a simple improvement to the thermal
feedback model - injecting the energy into a cone, rather than spherically
symmetrically - and show that this markedly improves the agreement between the
two prescriptions, without requiring any noticeable increase in the
computational cost of the simulation.

Interaction of light with Bloch states leads to Floquet-Bloch states which are
essential in realizing new photo-induced quantum phases. Similarly, dressing of
free electron states near the surface of a solid generates Volkov states which
are used to study non-linear optics in atoms and semiconductors. The
interaction of these two dynamic states with each other remains an open
experimental problem. Here we use Time and Angle Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) to selectively study the transition between these two
states on the surface of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. We find that the
coupling between the two strongly depends on the electron momentum, providing a
route to enhance or inhibit it. Moreover, by controlling the light polarization
we can negate Volkov states in order to generate pure Floquet-Bloch states.

electron in an oscillating electric field to the energy balance in atomic
ionization processes by a short laser pulse. Due to the time dependence of this
additional kinetic energy, a temporal average is assumed to maintain a
stationary energy conservation rule. This rule is used to predict the position
of the peaks observed in the photo electron spectra (PE). For a flat top pulse
envelope, the mean value of the quiver energy over the whole pulse leads to the
concept of ponderomotive energy $U_{p}$. However for a short pulse with a fast
changing field intensity a stationarity approximation could not be precise. We
check these concepts by studying first the photoelectron (PE) spectrum within
the Semiclassical Model (SCM) for a multiple steps pulses. The SCM offers the
possibility to establish a connection between emission times and the PE
spectrum in the energy domain. We show that PE substructures stem from
ionization at different times mapping the pulse envelope. We also present the
analysis of the PE spectrum for a realistic sine-squared envelope within the
Coulomb-Volkov and \textit{ab initio} calculations solving the time-dependent

with an SU(6)/Sp(6) group structure. The effective theory at the TeV scale is a
two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with additional heavy vector-like fermions and
vector-bosons. We identify a set of independent input parameters and develop
expressions for masses and couplings in terms of these. We perform a random
scan of the parameter space and find points that satisfy constraints, including
the recent 8 TeV LHC Higgs measurements, namely, the Higgs mass, Higgs
couplings to the top, bottom, $\tau$, $W^\pm$ and $Z$, top-quark mass, and
collider bounds on colored vector-like fermions ($t'$ and $b'$), and also
precision electroweak constraints. The LHC constraints on the $hWW$ and $hZZ$
couplings are satisfied by being close to the ""alignment limit"". We find how
fine-tuned the model is after including these constraints. For the points that
satisfy the constraints, we present the 1-loop effective couplings of the
CP-even and CP-odd neutral scalars to two gluons including contributions of
standard model and heavy vector-like quarks. We also present the branching
ratios of the heavy neutral scalars into the $\gamma\gamma,\, \tau\bar\tau,\,
b\bar b,\, t\bar t, WW, ZZ, Zh, hh$ modes, and the heavy charged scalar into
$tb,\, \tau\nu, cs, W h$ modes. These will aid searches of the heavy scalars at
the LHC and other future colliders.

strategy. Contrary to the established belief that block Markov coding is always
the rate-optimal DF strategy, under certain channel conditions (a link regime),
independent signaling between the source and relay achieves the same
transmission rate without requiring coherent channel phase information.
Further, this independent signaling regime allows the relay to conserve power.
As such, we design a composite DF relaying strategy that achieves the same rate
as block Markov DF but with less required relay power. The finding is
attractive from the link adaptation perspective to adapt relay coding and relay
power according to the link state. We examine this link adaptation in fading
under both perfect channel state information (CSI) and practical CSI, in which
nodes have perfect receive and long-term transmit CSI, and derive the
corresponding relay power savings in both cases. We also derive the outage
probability of the composite relaying scheme which adapts the signaling to the
link regime. Through simulation, we expose a novel trade-off for relay
placement showing that the relay conserves the most power when closer to the
destination but achieves the most rate gain when closer to the source.

observed images of SN Refsdal (images S1-S4) exhibited a slow rise (over ~150
days) to reach a broad peak brightness around 20 April, 2015. Using a set of
light curve templates constructed from SN 1987A-like peculiar Type II SNe, we
measure time delays for the four images relative to S1 of 4$\pm$4 (for S2),
2$\pm$5 (S3), and 24$\pm$7 days (S4). The measured magnification ratios
relative to S1 are 1.15$\pm$0.05 (S2), 1.01$\pm$0.04 (S3), and 0.34$\pm$0.02

of SN Refsdal, so we also derive complementary measurements for these

These more flexible fits deliver fully consistent time delays of 7$\pm$2 (S2),
0.6$\pm$3 (S3), and 27$\pm$8 days (S4). The lensing magnification ratios are
similarly consistent, measured as 1.17$\pm$0.02 (S2), 1.00$\pm$0.01 (S3), and
0.38$\pm$0.02 (S4). We compare these measurements against published predictions

results on a differential correlator, where the flow of positive and negative

coupled with strong radial and anisotropic flow.

that its findings cannot be generalized to all journals or fields. The study is

confirms findings on source coverage and citation impact obtained in earlier

Scopus citation counts at the article level is high: Pearson's R is in the
range of 0.8-0.9. A median Scopus indexing delay of two months compared to GS
is largely though not exclusively due to missing cited references in articles
in press in Scopus. The effect of double citation counts in GS due to multiple

2 per cent of cases. Pros and cons of article-based and what is termed as

ordered state is closely linked to a lowering of structural symmetry from
tetragonal ($C_{4}$) to orthorhombic ($C_{2}$). However, recently, a regime of
$C_{4}$-symmetric magnetic order has been reported in certain hole-doped
iron-based superconductors. This novel magnetic ground state can be understood
as a double-$\mathbf{Q}$ spin density wave characterized by two order
parameters $\mathbf{M}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{M}_{2}$ related to each of the two
$\mathbf{Q}$ vectors. Depending on the relative orientations of the order
parameters, either a noncollinear spin-vortex crystal or a nonuniform
charge-spin density wave could form. Experimentally, M\""ossbauer spectroscopy,
neutron scattering, and muon spin rotation established the latter as the
magnetic configuration of some of these optimally hole-doped iron-based
superconductors. Theoretically, low-energy itinerant models do support a
transition from single-$\mathbf{Q}$ to double-$\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic order, but
with nearly-degenerate spin-vortex crystal and charge-spin density wave states.
In fact, extensions of these low-energy models including additional electronic
interactions tip the balance in favor of the spin-vortex crystal, in apparent
contradiction with the recent experimental findings. In this paper, we revisit
the phase diagram of magnetic ground states of low-energy multi-band models in
the presence of weak disorder. We show that impurity scattering not only
promotes the transition from $C_{2}$ to $C_{4}$-magnetic order, but it also
favors the charge-spin density wave over the spin-vortex crystal phase.
Additionally, in the single-$\mathbf{Q}$ phase, our analysis of the nematic
coupling constant in the presence of disorder supports the experimental finding
that the splitting between the structural and stripe-magnetic transition is
enhanced by disorder.

singlet scalar $\phi$ with Yukawa couplings $\phi \bar X X$ to vector-like
fermions $X$ with mass $m_X > m_\phi/2$ can easily explain the observed signal,
provided $X$ carries both SM color and electric charge. We instead consider
first the possibility that the pair production of a fermion, charged under both
SM gauge groups and a confining $SU(3)_v$ gauge group, is responsible. If pair
produced it forms a quirky bound state, which promptly annihilates into gluons,
photons, v-gluons and possibly SM fermions. This is an extremely minimal model
to explain the excess, but is already in some tension with existing displaced
searches, as well as dilepton and dijet resonance bounds. We therefore propose
a hybrid Quirk-Scalar model, in which the fermion of the simple $\phi \bar X X$
toy model is charged under the additional $SU(3)_v$ confining gauge group.
Constraints on the new heavy fermion $X$ are then significantly relaxed. The
main additional signals of this model are possible dilepton, dijet and diphoton
resonances at $\sim$ 2 TeV or more from quirk annihilation, and the production
of v-glueballs through quirk annihilation and $\phi$ decay. The glueballs can
give rise to spectacular signatures, including displaced vertices and events
with leptons, photons and $Z$-bosons. If the Quirk-Scalar model is responsible
for the 750 GeV excess it should be discovered in one of these channels with 20

diagram, in which a high transition-temperature (Tc) s-wave superconducting
state emerges next to a Mott insulating phase as a function of the lattice
spacing. This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and
phonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental
question on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article
reviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing
comprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and
elucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the
electron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an
unconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A
driving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions,
characterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction
and a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a
subtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and
Hund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction
leads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules,
which enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially
relies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits
from the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic
energy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in
agreement with previous model calculations. This confirms that the alkali-doped
fullerides are a new type of unconventional superconductors, where the unusual
synergy between the phonons and Coulomb interactions drives the high-Tc
superconductivity.

definitions of non-adiabaticity: one is appropriate for a thermodynamic fluid
$\delta P_{nad}$, another is for a general matter field $\delta P_{c,nad}$, and
the last one is valid only on superhorizon scales. The first two definitions
coincide if $c_s^2=c_w^2$ where $c_s$ is the propagation speed of the
perturbation, while $c_w^2=\dot P/\dot\rho$. Assuming the adiabaticity in the
general sense, $\delta P_{c,nad}=0$, we derive a relation between the lapse
function in the comoving sli\-cing $A_c$ and $\delta P_{nad}$ valid for
arbitrary matter field in any theory of gravity, by using only momentum
conservation. The relation implies that as long as $c_s\neq c_w$, the uniform
density, comoving and the proper-time slicings coincide approximately for any
gravity theory and for any matter field if $\delta P_{nad}=0$ approximately. In
the case of general relativity this gives the equivalence between the comoving
curvature perturbation $R_c$ and the uniform density curvature perturbation
$\zeta$ on superhorizon scales, and their conservation.
  We then consider an example in which $c_w=c_s$, where $\delta P_{nad}=\delta
P_{c,nad}=0$ exactly, but the equivalence between $R_c$ and $\zeta$ no longer
holds. Namely we consider the so-called ultra slow-roll inflation. In this case
both $R_c$ and $\zeta$ are not conserved. In particular, as for $\zeta$, we
find that it is crucial to take into account the next-to-leading order term in
$\zeta$'s spatial gradient expansion to show its non-conservation, even on

thermodynamic sense) is not always enough to ensure the conservation of $R_c$

accelerated by the foot. A model incorporating these dynamics reveals that
added mass degrades the performance of certain self-deformations due to a shift

vary the virial mass and concentration of the host galaxy's dark-matter halo.
We show that sizes of GCs are determined by the local galactic mass density
rather than the virial mass of the host galaxy. We find that clusters evolving
in the inner haloes of less concentrated galaxies are significantly more
extended than those evolving in more concentrated ones, while the sizes of
those orbiting in the outer halo are almost independent of concentration.
Adding a baryonic component to our galaxy models does not change these results
much, since its effect is only significant in the very inner halo. Our
simulations suggest that there is a relation between $r_h$ and $R_G$, which
systematically depends on the physical parameters of the halo. Hence, observing
such relations in individual galaxies can put a new observational constraint on
dark-matter halo characteristics. However, by varying the halo mass in a wide
range of $10^{9}\leq M_{vir}/\msun \leq10^{13}$, we find that the $r_h-R_G$

group, translations that do not map the enlarged unit cell of the density wave
to itself, and become ""non-symmorphic""-like elements. Multi-dimensional
representations of the extended point group are associated with degenerate wave
vectors. Electronic properties such as (nodal) band degeneracies and
topological character can be straightforwardly addressed, and often follow
directly. To further flesh out the idea of symmetry, the classification is
constructed so as to manifestly distinguish time-reversal invariant charge
(i.e., site and bond) order, and time-reversal breaking flux order. For the
purpose of the present work we particularize to spin-rotation invariant density
waves. As a first example of the application of the classification we consider
the density waves of a simple single- and two-orbital square lattice model. The
main objective, however, is to apply the classification to two-dimensional

significantly higher H$_{2}$ to HI ratio for Virgo galaxies. Combining our data
with complementary H$\alpha$ star formation rate measurements, Virgo galaxies
have longer molecular gas depletion times compared to group galaxies, due to
their higher H$_{2}$ masses and lower star formation rates. We suggest that the
longer depletion times may be a result of heating processes in the cluster
environment or differences in the turbulent pressure. From the full sample, we
find that the molecular gas depletion time has a positive correlation with the
stellar mass, indicative of differences in the star formation process between
low and high mass galaxies, and a negative correlation between the molecular
gas depletion time and the specific star formation rate.

$3.6 \sigma$ and $2.6 \sigma$, respectively. We entertain the possibility that
this excess is due to new physics, in which case the data suggest a new
particle with 13 TeV LHC production cross section times diphoton branching
ratio of about 5~fb. Interestingly, ATLAS reports a mild preference for a
sizeable width for the signal of about 45 GeV; this result appears consistent
with CMS, and is further supported by improving the compatibility of the 8 TeV

scalar. First, we show that, in addition to the new state that is needed
directly to produce the diphoton bump, yet more new particles beyond the
Standard Model are needed to induce diphoton decay rate of the right size.
Second, we note that if the excess is attributed to the Breit-Wigner peak of a
single new state, then the signal strength and width -- taken together --
suggest a total LHC production cross section of order $10^5$ fb. Restricting to
perturbative models without ad-hoc introduction of many new states or exotic
charges, we reach the following conclusions: (i) Gluon-fusion cannot explain
the required large production cross section. (ii) Tree level production from
initial state quarks cannot explain the required branching ratio to two
photons. (iii) Tree level production is constrained by flavor data as well as
LHC Run-I and Tevatron dijet analyses. Insisting on a large width we are led to
suggest that more than one scalar states, nearly degenerate in mass, could

undertaken deep SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations of a sample of 17 FeLoBAL QSOs
with 0.89 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 2.78 and -23.31 $\leq$ M$_{B}$ $\leq$-28.50 to
directly detect an excess in the thermal emission of the dust which would probe
enhanced star-formation activity. We find that FeLoBALs are not luminous
sources in the submillimetre, none of them are individually detected at 850
$\mu$m, nor as a population through stacking ($F_{s}=1.14\pm0.58$ mJy).
Statistical and survival analyses reveal that FeLoBALs have sub-mm properties
consistent with BAL and non-BAL QSOs with matched redshifts and magnitudes. An
SED fitting analysis shows that the FIR emission is dominated by AGN activity,
and a starburst component is required only in 6/17 sources of our sample;
moreover the integrated total luminosity of 16/17 sources is
L$\geq$10$^{12}$L$_{\odot}$, high enough to classify FeLoBALs as infrared
luminous. In conclusion, we do not find any evidence in support of FeLoBAL QSOs
being a transition population between a ULIRG and an unobscured QSO; in
particular, FeLoBALs are not characterized by a cold starburst which would
support this hypothesis.

hollow central cavity; and a spatial symmetry is lost, resulting in a lopsided

insensitive to disc viscosity and pressure. The $q=0.04$ transition has
relevance for the evolution of massive black hole binary+disc systems at the

to a few hundred kilometers on the ground. This scenario presents unique
challenges, such as high photon losses and restricted classical data
transmission and processing power due to the limitations of a typical satellite

a QKD protocol, with optical transmission and full post-processing, in the
high-loss regime using minimized computing hardware at the receiver. Employing
weak coherent pulses with decoy states, we demonstrate the production of secure
key bits at up to 56.5 dB of photon loss. We further illustrate the feasibility
of a satellite uplink by generating secure key while experimentally emulating
the varying channel losses predicted for realistic low-Earth-orbit satellite
passes at 600 km altitude. With a 76 MHz source and including finite-size
analysis, we extract 3374 bits of secure key from the best pass. We also
illustrate the potential benefit of combining multiple passes together: while
one suboptimal ""upper-quartile"" pass produces no finite-sized key with our
source, the combination of three such passes allows us to extract 165 bits of
secure key. Alternatively, we find that by increasing the signal rate to 300
MHz it would be possible to extract 21570 bits of secure finite-sized key in
just a single upper-quartile pass.

heating mechanisms to circumvent the cooling-flow problem in galaxy clusters.
However, the role of thermal conduction remains unclear. Previous studies have
shown that anisotropic thermal conduction in cluster cool cores (CC) could
drive the heat-flux driven buoyancy instabilities (HBI) that re-orient the
field lines in the azimuthal directions and isolate the cores from conductive
heating from the outskirts. However, how the AGN interacts with the HBI is
still unknown. To understand these interwined processes, we perform the first
3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of isolated CC clusters that include
anisotropic conduction, radiative cooling, and AGN feedback. We find that: (1)
For realistic magnetic field strengths in clusters, magnetic tension can
suppress a significant portion of HBI-unstable modes and thus the HBI is either
completely inhibited or significantly impaired, depending on the unknown
magnetic field coherence length. (2) Turbulence driven by AGN jets can
effectively randomize magnetic field lines and sustain conductivity at ~1/3 of
the Spitzer value; however, the AGN-driven turbulence is not volume-filling.
(3) Conductive heating within the cores could contribute to ~10% of the
radiative losses in Perseus-like clusters and up to ~50% for clusters twice the
mass of Perseus. (4) Thermal conduction has various impacts on the AGN activity
and ICM properties for the hottest clusters, which may be searched by future
observations to constrain the level of conductivity in clusters. The
distribution of cold gas and the implications are also discussed.

of the $S^{(2)}$ theory of binary alloys developed by G. M. Stocks, J. B.
Staunton, D. D. Johnson and others. It is highly relevant to the chemical phase
stability of high-entropy alloys as it predicts the kind and size of
finite-temperature chemical fluctuations. In doing so it includes effects of
rearranging charge and other electronics due to changing site occupancies. When
chemical fluctuations grow without bound an absolute instability occurs and a
second-order order-disorder phase transition may be inferred. The S$^{(2)}$
theory is predicated on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem; thus we derive the
linear response of the CPA medium to perturbations in site-dependent chemical
potentials in great detail. The theory lends itself to a natural interpretation
in terms of competing effects: entropy driving disorder and favorable pair
interactions driving atomic ordering. To further clarify interpretation we
present results for representative ternary alloys CuAgAu, NiPdPt, RhPdAg, and
CoNiCu within a frozen charge (or band-only) approximation. These results

formation in the mildly non-linear regime. The central object of the method is
the time-dependent probability distribution function generating correlators of
the cosmological observables at a given moment of time. Expanding the
distribution function around the Gaussian weight we formulate a perturbative
technique to calculate non-linear corrections to cosmological correlators,
similar to the diagrammatic expansion in a three-dimensional Euclidean quantum
field theory, with time playing the role of an external parameter. For the
physically relevant case of cold dark matter in an Einstein--de Sitter
universe, the time evolution of the distribution function can be found exactly
and is encapsulated by a time-dependent coupling constant controlling the
perturbative expansion. We show that all building blocks of the expansion are
free from spurious infrared enhanced contributions that plague the standard
cosmological perturbation theory. This paves the way towards the systematic
resummation of infrared effects in large scale structure formation. We also
argue that the approach proposed here provides a natural framework to account
for the influence of short-scale dynamics on larger scales along the lines of
effective field theory.

and its extensions due to its simplicity and efficiency. When applying
coordinate descent to solving Lasso, we update one coordinate at a time while
fixing the remaining coordinates. Such an update, which is usually easy to
compute, greedily decreases the objective function value. In this paper, we aim
to improve its computational efficiency by reducing the number of coordinate
descent iterations. To this end, we propose a novel technique called Successive
Ray Refinement (SRR). SRR makes use of the following ray continuation property
on the successive iterations: for a particular coordinate, the value obtained
in the next iteration almost always lies on a ray that starts at its previous
iteration and passes through the current iteration. Motivated by this
ray-continuation property, we propose that coordinate descent be performed not
directly on the previous iteration but on a refined search point that has the
following properties: on one hand, it lies on a ray that starts at a history
solution and passes through the previous iteration, and on the other hand, it
achieves the minimum objective function value among all the points on the ray.
We propose two schemes for defining the search point and show that the refined
search point can be efficiently obtained. Empirical results for real and
synthetic data sets show that the proposed SRR can significantly reduce the
number of coordinate descent iterations, especially for small Lasso
regularization parameters.

essentials of quantum logic, with probabilistic and Boolean logic as special
cases. Predicates in effectus theory are not subobjects having a Heyting
algebra structure, like in topos theory, but `characteristic' functions,
forming effect algebras. Such effect algebras are algebraic models of
quantitative logic, in which double negation holds. Effects in quantum theory
and fuzzy predicates in probability theory form examples of effect algebras.
  This text is an account of the basics of effectus theory. It includes the
fundamental duality between states and effects, with the associated Born rule
for validity of an effect (predicate) in a particular state. A basic result
says that effectuses can be described equivalently in both `total' and
`partial' form. So-called `commutative' and `Boolean' effectuses are
distinguished, for probabilistic and classical models. It is shown how these
Boolean effectuses are essentially extensive categories. A large part of the
theory is devoted to the logical notions of comprehension and quotient, which
are described abstractly as right adjoint to truth, and as left adjoint to
falisity, respectively. It is illustrated how comprehension and quotients are
closely related to measurement. The paper closes with a section on
`non-commutative' effectus theory, where the appropriate formalisation is not
entirely clear yet.

cracked by attackers, password-based authentication remains the most
widely-used method. To encourage users to select good passwords, enterprises
often enforce policies. Such policies have been proven to be ineffectual in
practice. Accurate assessment of a password's resistance to cracking attacks is
still an unsolved problem, and our work addresses this challenge. Although the
best way to determine how difficult it may be to crack a user-selected password
is to check its resistance to cracking attacks employed by attackers in the
wild, implementing such a strategy at an enterprise would be infeasible in
practice. We first formalize the concepts of password complexity and strength
with concrete definitions emphasizing their differences. Our framework captures
human biases and many known techniques attackers use to recover stolen
credentials in real life, such as brute-force attacks. Building on our
definitions, we develop a general framework for calculating password complexity
and strength that could be used in practice. Our approach is based on the key
insight that an attacker's success at cracking a password must be defined by
its available computational resources, time, function used to store that
password, as well as the topology that bounds that attacker's search space
based on that attacker's available inputs, transformations it can use to tweak
and explore its inputs, and the path of exploration which can be based on the
attacker's perceived probability of success. We also provide a general
framework for assessing the accuracy of password complexity and strength
estimators that can be used to compare other tools available in the wild.

possible to heat the chromospheric plasma by direct resistive dissipation of

unlikely to be sufficient to balance radiative and conductive losses unless
unrealistic field strengths or photospheric velocities are used. The precise
heating profile is determined by the input driving spectrum since in 1.5D there
is no possibility of Alfv\'en wave turbulence. The inclusion of the Hall term
does not affect the heating rates. If plasma compressibility is taken into
account, shocks are produced through the ponderomotive coupling of Alfv\'en
waves to slow modes and shock heating dominates the resistive dissipation. In
1.5D shock coalescence amplifies the effects of shocks and for compressible
simulations with realistic driver spectra the heating rate exceeds that
required to match radiative and conductive losses. Thus while the heating rates
for these 1.5D simulations are an overestimate they do show that ponderomotive
coupling of Alfv\'en waves to sound waves is more important in chromospheric
heating than Pedersen dissipation through ion-neutral collisions.

unparalleled in any other period of history and this growth is shaping the

a longitudinal dataset from Foursquare, a location-based social network, to
analyse urban growth across 100 major cities worldwide.
  Initially we explore how urban growth differs in cities across the world. We
show that there exists a strong spatial correlation, with nearby pairs of
cities more likely to share similar growth profiles than remote pairs of
cities. Subsequently we investigate how growth varies inside cities and
demonstrate that, given the existing local density of places,
higher-than-expected growth is highly localised while lower-than-expected
growth is more diffuse. Finally we attempt to use the dataset to characterise
competition between new and existing venues. By defining a measure based on the
change in throughput of a venue before and after the opening of a new nearby
venue, we demonstrate which venue types have a positive effect on venues of the
same type and which have a negative effect. For example, our analysis confirms
the hypothesis that there is large degree of competition between bookstores, in
the sense that existing bookstores normally experience a notable drop in
footfall after a new bookstore opens nearby. Other place categories however,
such as Airport Gates or Museums, have a cooperative effect and their presence
fosters higher traffic volumes to nearby places of the same type.

Schroedinger equation by central finite differences leads to a non-symmetric
Hamiltonian matrix. Because diagonalization of such matrices is more complex it
is advantageous to transform it in a symmetric form. This can be done by the
Liouville-like transformation proposed by Rizea et al. (Comp. Phys. Comm. 179
(2008) 466-478), which replaces the wave function psi(rho) with the function
F(rho)=psi(rho)sqrt(rho) and transforms the Hamiltonian accordingly. Even
though a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix is produced by this procedure, the
computed wave functions are found to be inaccurate near the origin, and the
accuracy of the energy levels is not very high. In order to improve on this, we
devised a finite-difference scheme which discretizes the Schroedinger equation
in the first step, and then applies the Liouville-like transformation to the
difference equation. Such a procedure gives a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix,
resulting in an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the finite element
method. The superior efficiency of the new finite-difference (FDM) scheme is
demonstrated for a few rho-dependent one-dimensional potentials which are
usually employed to model the electron states in free-standing and core-shell
quantum wires. The new scheme is compared with the other FDM schemes for
solving the effective-mass Schroedinger equation, and is found to deliver
energy levels with much smaller numerical error for all the analyzed

However, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false
beliefs, their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally
inconsistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other biases. We demonstrate how
to incorporate these deviations into algorithms for preference inference by
constructing generative models of planning for agents who are subject to false

multiferroic materials. While the bulk compound is rhombohedral (R), the
discovery of an epitaxial strain-induced structural transition into a so-called
'super tetragonal-phase' (T-phase) in this material incited a flurry of
research activity focused on gaining an understanding of this phase transition
and its possible functionalities. This metastable phase of BiFeO$_3$ is also
multiferroic, with giant ferroelectric polarization and coexisting
antiferromagnetic order, but above all it is the strain relaxation-induced
phase mixtures and their outstanding piezoelectric and magnetoelectric
responses which continue to intrigue and motivate the physicist and materials

mixed-phase BiFeO$_3$ system. We begin with a brief summary of the history of
the T-phase and an analysis of the structure of the various phases reported in
the literature. We then address important questions regarding the symmetry and
octahedral rotation patterns and the (as yet underexplored) important role of
chemistry in the formation of the metastable T-phase. We follow by describing
the phase transitions in this material, and how these may hold promise for
large magnetoelectric responses. Finally we point out some experimental

significantly different radial distributions. This finding can be theoretically
explained by a combination of radial drift and gas drag of intermediate-sized
dust grains. Using a simple parametric model to approximate the different
distributions of the gas and dust components, we calculate and examine the
impact of radial drift on the global dust temperature structure. We find that
the removal of large grains beyond the ""truncation radius"" allows this region
to become significantly warmer from reprocessed stellar radiation shining down
from the disk upper layers, increasing the outer disk temperature by
$\sim10-30\%$. This change is sufficient to raise the local temperature to a
value exceeding the CO desorption temperature. These findings imply that the
disk density structures induced by radial drift are able to create multiple CO
snow-lines. The inner disk CO is in the gas phase, freezing out near the
classical snow-line at $R\sim20-40$ AU. Moving outward, the CO sublimates once
again beyond the truncation radius (80 AU in our models) and subsequently
re-freezes out at sufficiently large stellar distances, beyond
$R\gtrsim130-200$ AU. We find that thermal desorption of CO in the outer disk
becomes competitive with external UV photodesorption and that this additional
transition from solid state CO to the gas-phase has significant implications
for the C/O ratio in the outer disk.

information, it is sometimes possible to produce large numbers of replicas with
vanishingly small error. This phenomenon, known as quantum superreplication,
can take place both for quantum states and quantum gates. The aim of this paper
is to review the central features of quantum superreplication, providing a
unified view on the existing results. The paper also includes new results. In
particular, we show that, when quantum superreplication can be achieved, it can
be achieved through estimation, up to an error vanishing with a power law.
Quantum strategies still offer an advantage for superreplication, in that they
allow for an exponentially faster reduction of the error. Using the relation
with estimation, we provide i) an alternative proof of the optimality of the
Heisenberg scaling of quantum metrology, ii) a strategy to estimate arbitrary
unitary gates with Heisenberg scaling, up to a logarithmic overhead, and iii) a
protocol that generates M nearly perfect copies of a generic pure state with a
number of queries to the corresponding unitary gate scaling as the square root
of M. Finally, we point out that superreplication can be achieved using
interactions among k systems, provided that k is large compared to square of
the ratio between the numbers of input and output copies.

literatures and justifying the need for more rigorous modeling of AI progress,
this paper contributes to that research program by suggesting ways to account
for the relationship between hardware speed increases and algorithmic
improvements in AI, the role of human inputs in enabling AI capabilities, and
the relationships between different sub-fields of AI. It then outlines ways of
tailoring AI progress models to generate insights on the specific issue of
technological unemployment, and outlines future directions for research on AI

barrier and the soft potential step, plotted in a previous work, show that more
trajectories link the left and right regions of the barrier, when the energy is
increased. In this paper, we evaluate the reflection probability using a new
ansatz based on these observations, as the ratio between the total
probabilities of reflected and incident trajectories. While doing this, we also
put to test the complex-extended probability density previously postulated for
these quantum trajectories. The new ansatz is preferred since the evaluation is
solely done with the help of the complex-extended probability density along the
imaginary direction and the trajectory pattern itself. The calculations are
performed for a rectangular potential barrier, symmetric Eckart and Morse
barriers, and a soft potential step. The predictions are in perfect agreement
with the standard results for potentials such as the rectangular potential
barrier. For the other potentials, there is very good agreement with standard
results, but it is exact only for low and high energies. For moderate energies,
there are slight deviations. These deviations result from the periodicity of
the trajectory pattern along the imaginary axis and have a maximum value only
as much as $0.1 \%$ of the standard value. Measurement of such deviation shall
provide an opportunity to falsify the ansatz.

cost, where voters and candidates are associated with points in some underlying
metric space. The social cost of a candidate is the sum of its distances to
each voter. Some of our work assumes that these points can be modeled on a real
line, but other results of ours are more general.
  A question closely related to candidate selection is that of minimizing the
sum of distances for facility location. The difference is that in our setting
there is a fixed set of candidates, whereas the large body of work on facility
location seems to consider every point in the metric space to be a possible
candidate. This gives rise to three types of mechanisms which differ in the
granularity of their input space (voting, ranking and location mechanisms). We
study the relationships between these three classes of mechanisms.
  While it may seem that Black's 1948 median algorithm is optimal for candidate
selection on the line, this is not the case. We give matching upper and lower
bounds for a variety of settings. In particular, when candidates and voters are
on the line, our universally truthful spike mechanism gives a [tight]
approximation of two. When assessing candidate selection mechanisms, we seek
several desirable properties: (a) efficiency (minimizing the social cost) (b)
truthfulness (dominant strategy incentive compatibility) and (c) simplicity (a
smaller input space). We quantify the effect that truthfulness and simplicity

consisting of a quasar at z = 0.276 and an extended source 3"" northern to the
quasar. The quasar shows a blue-skewed profile of Balmer broad emission lines,
which can be well modeled as emissions from a circular disk with a blueshift
velocity of ~1400 km/s. The blueshift is better interpreted as resulting from a
recoiling active black hole than from a super-massive black hole binary, since
the line profile almost kept steady over one decade in the quasar rest-frame.
Alternative interpretations are possible as well, such as emissions from a
bipolar outflow or a circular disk with spiral emissivity perturbations. The
extended source shows Seyfert-like narrow line ratios and a [OIII] luminosity
of >1.4\times10^8L_\odot, with almost the same redshift as the quasar and a
projected distance of 12.5 kpc at the redshift. SBS 1421+511 is thus likely to
be an interacting galaxy pair with dual AGN. Alternatively, the quasar
companion only appears to be active but not necessarily so: the gas
before/in/behind the companion galaxy is illuminated by the quasar as an
extended emission line region is detected at a similar distance in the opposite
direction southern to the quasar, which may be generated either by tidal
interactions between the galaxy pair or large-scale outflows from the quasar.

before becoming saturated, or unstable. We considered different particular
cases of such systems, which were obtained by modifying the capacity of the
intermediary buffers, the arrival rate and the service rates. The results of
the simulations are presented in our paper and can be summed up in the
following conclusions: 1. The analytic formula for the maximum throughput of
the system tends to become rather complicated when the number of servers
increase 2. The maximum throughput of the system converges as the number of

characteristic: if we reverse the order of the servers, maximum thruoughput of

cloud size has been estimated to be of the order of few gravitational radii
from the observed absorption variability. Such small cloud sizes are comparable
to the X-ray emitting regions so that a detailed modeling of occultation events
in AGN has the potential of enabling us to infer accurately the geometry of the
system. We have developed a relativistic X-ray spectral model for occultation
events and we present here theoretical predictions on the different observables

maximum takes place when the approaching part of the accretion disc is covered.

An adimensional theory of gravity (Agravity) is employed, allowing for the

Higgs portal and the scalar non-minimal couplings, respectively, once a
Coleman-Weinberg dynamically-generated vacuum expectation value for the singlet

correct observational relic abundance. Identifying the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone

accommodates successful slow-roll inflation, compatible with the observational

exactly in the limit $n\to\infty$ in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenenergies
of a selfconsistent Schr\""odinger equation involving a potential $v(z)$ with
the near-boundary singular behavior $v(z\to 0+)\approx
-1/(4z^2)+4m/(\pi^{2}z)$, where $m=1/\xi_+(|t|)$ is the inverse bulk

the second boundary plane. The potential $v(z)$, the excess free energy, and
the Casimir force have been determined numerically with high precision. Exact
analytical results for a variety of properties such as series expansion
coefficients of $v(z)$, the scattering data of $v(z)$ in the semi-infinite case

composite dark matter, i.e. dark matter particles that form neutral bound
states, generically called dark atoms, either with ordinary particles, or with
other dark matter particles. Three different scenarios are investigated: the
O-helium scenario, milli- interacting dark matter and dark anti-atoms. In each
of them, dark matter interacts sufficiently strongly with terrestrial matter to
be stopped in it before reaching underground detectors. As they drift towards
the center of the earth by gravity, these thermal dark atoms are radiatively
captured by the atoms of the active medium of underground detectors, which
causes the emission of photons that produce the signals through their
interactions with the electrons of the medium. This provides a way of
reinterpreting the results in terms of electron recoils instead of nuclear
recoils. The detailed study of the interactions of O-helium with ordinary
matter shows that it is not an acceptable candidate for dark matter because of
the absence of a repulsion mechanism preventing it from falling into the deep
nuclear wells of nuclei. The two other models involve milli-charges and are
able to reconcile the most contradictory experiments. We determine, for each
model, the regions in the parameter space that reproduce the experiments with
positive results in full consistency with the constraints of the experiments
with negative results. We also pay attention to the experimental and
observational constraints on milli-charges and discuss some typical signatures

the need of automated mass assembly of around ten million channels stringently
required by the high granularity, we developed a design of scintillator tiles

of the bottom surface of each tile to provide enough room for the whole SiPM
package and to improve collection of the light produced by incident particles
penetrating the tile at different positions. The cavity design has been
optimized using a GEANT4-based full simulation model to achieve a high response

single-MIP response for scintillator tiles with an optimized cavity design has
been measured using cosmic rays, which shows that a SiPM with a sensitive area
of only $\mathbf{1\times1~mm^2}$ (Hamamatsu MPPC S12571-025P) reaches a mean
response of more than 23 photon equivalents with a dynamic range of many tens

conductivities along the zigzag and armchair directions are 10.83 W/m-K and 9.2

anharmonicity in the crystal resulting in high Gr\""{u}neisen parameters, and
low group velocities. The room temperature effective phonon mean free path is
found to be around 17 nm indicating that the thermal transport in stanene is

public transport networks, such as airline and railway networks have been

day-to-day commutation, it is of significant interest to analyze their
topological structure, and answer some of the basic questions on their

topologies arising due to an interplay between preferential and random
attachment of nodes. Unlike real-world networks, like the Internet, WWW and

We propose to optimize geometrical shape of the mirrors of the detector to
reduce the diffraction-limited finesse of unessential optical modes of the
interferometer resulting in increase of the threshold of the opto-mechanical
instabilities and subsequent increase of the measurement sensitivity. Utilizing
parameters of the LIGO interferometer we found that the proposed technique
allows constructing a Fabry-Perot interferometer with round trip diffraction
loss of the fundamental mode not exceeding $5$~ppm, whereas the loss of the
first dipole as well as the other high order modes exceed $1,000$~ppm and
$8,000$~ppm, respectively. The optimization comes at the price of tighter
tolerances on the mirror tilt stability, but does not result in a significant
modification of the optical beam profile and does not require changes in the
the gravity detector read-out system. The cavity with proposed mirrors is also
stable with respect to the slight modification of the mirror shape.

obtain a new family of digraphs with minimal diameter, that is, given the

it is derived from the Kautz digraphs $K(d,\ell)$. %It is not common to find
non-regular digraphs with minimal diameter given their number of vertices and
out-degree.
  It is well-known that the Kautz digraphs $K(d,\ell)$ have the smallest
diameter among all digraphs with their number of vertices and degree. We define
the cyclic Kautz digraphs $CK(d,\ell)$, whose vertices are labeled by all
possible sequences $a_1\ldots a_\ell$ of length $\ell$, such that each
character $a_i$ is chosen from an alphabet containing $d+1$ distinct symbols,
where the consecutive characters in the sequence are different (as in Kautz
digraphs), and now also requiring that $a_1\neq a_\ell$. The cyclic Kautz
digraphs $CK(d,\ell)$ have arcs between vertices $a_1 a_2\ldots a_\ell$ and
$a_2 \ldots a_\ell a_{\ell+1}$, with $a_1\neq a_\ell$ and $a_2\neq a_{\ell+1}$.
Unlike in Kautz digraphs $K(d,\ell)$, any label of a vertex of $CK(d,\ell)$ can
be cyclically shifted to form again a label of a vertex of $CK(d,\ell)$.
  We give the main parameters of $CK(d,\ell)$: number of vertices, number of
arcs, and diameter. Moreover, we construct the modified cyclic Kautz digraphs
$MCK(d,\ell)$ to obtain the same diameter as in the Kautz digraphs, and we show
that $MCK(d,\ell)$ are $d$-out-regular. Finally, we compute the number of
vertices of the iterated line digraphs of $CK(d,\ell)$.

which reproduces a family of continuous linear operators on the space. The
theory of ORKHSs and the associated operator reproducing kernels are
established. A special class of ORKHSs, known as the perfect ORKHSs, are
studied, which reproduce the family of the standard point-evaluation operators
and at the same time another different family of continuous linear operators.
The perfect ORKHSs are characterized in terms of features, especially for those
with respect to integral operators. In particular, several specific examples of
the perfect ORKHSs are presented. We apply the theory of ORKHSs to sampling and
regularized learning, where operator-valued data are considered. Specifically,
a general complete reconstruction formula from linear operators values is
established in the framework of ORKHSs. The average sampling and the
reconstruction of vector-valued functions are considered in specific ORKHSs. We
also investigate in the ORKHSs setting the regularized learning schemes, which
learn a target element from operator-valued data. The desired representer
theorems of the learning problems are established to demonstrate the key roles
played by the ORKHSs and the operator reproducing kernels in machine learning
from operator-valued data. We finally point out that the continuity of linear
operators, used to obtain the operator-valued data, on an ORKHS is necessary
for the stability of the numerical reconstruction algorithm using the resulting

elasto-plasticity starting from first principles and a few well-defined
structural assumptions, incorporating the mildly rate-dependent (viscous)
nature of plastic flow and the microscopic origins of plastic deformations. For
the global dynamics, we start from a two-stage time-stepping scheme, expressing
the fact that in most real materials plastic flow is much slower than elastic
deformations, and then perform a detailed analysis of the slow-loading limit
passage. In this limit, a rate-independent evolution can be expected, but this
brings with it the possibility of jumps (relative to the ""slow"" time).
Traditionally, the dynamics on the jump transients often remain unspecified,
which leads to ambiguity and deficiencies in the energy balance. In order to
remedy this, the present approach precisely describes the energetics on the
jump transients as the limit of the rate-dependent evolutions at ""singular
points"". It turns out that rate-dependent behavior may (but does not have to)
prevail on the jump transients. Based on this, we introduce the new solution
concept of ""two-speed solutions"" to the elasto-plastic evolutionary system,

$(a^\dag)^{r_n}a^{s_n}\cdots(a^\dag)^{r_1}a^{s_1}=(a^\dag)^\alpha\displaystyle\sum

These objects are used to define a combinatorial Hopf algebra which specializes
to the enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra. Here, we propose a new
variant of this construction which admits a realization with variables. This
means that we construct our algebra from a free algebra $\mathbb{C}\langle A
\rangle$ using quotient and shifted product. The combinatorial objects
(B-diagrams) are slightly different from those proposed by Blasiak \emph{et
al.}, but give also a combinatorial interpretation of the generalized Stirling
numbers together with a combinatorial Hopf algebra related to Heisenberg Lie
algebra. The main difference comes from the fact that the B-diagrams have the
same number of inputs and outputs. After studying the combinatorics and the
enumeration of B-diagrams, we propose two constructions of algebras called
Fusion algebra $\mathcal{F}$, defined using formal variable and another algebra
$\mathcal{B}$ constructed directly from the B-diagrams. We show the connection
between these two algebras and that $\mathcal{B}$ can be endowed with a Hopf
structure. We recognize two already known combinatorial Hopf subalgebras of

problem to soft clusterings, i.e. clusterings where each points belongs to each
cluster to some degree. Although popular in practice, prior to this work the
fuzzy $K$-means problem has not been studied from a complexity theoretic or
algorithmic perspective. We show that optimal solutions for fuzzy $K$-means
cannot, in general, be expressed by radicals over the input points.
Surprisingly, this already holds for very simple inputs in one-dimensional
space. Hence, one cannot expect to compute optimal solutions exactly. We give
the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the fuzzy $K$-means
problem. First, we present a deterministic approximation algorithm whose
runtime is polynomial in $N$ and linear in the dimension $D$ of the input set,
given that $K$ is constant, i.e. a polynomial time approximation algorithm
given a fixed $K$. We achieve this result by showing that for each soft
clustering there exists a hard clustering with comparable properties. Second,
by using techniques known from coreset constructions for the $K$-means problem,
we develop a deterministic approximation algorithm that runs in time almost
linear in $N$ but exponential in the dimension $D$. We complement these results
with a randomized algorithm which imposes some natural restrictions on the
input set and whose runtime is comparable to some of the most efficient
approximation algorithms for $K$-means, i.e. linear in the number of points and
the dimension, but exponential in the number of clusters.

mass leads to a coupled system of three differential equations. A partial
differential equation models the dynamic and spatial behaviour of the
concentration of tubulin that is transported along the axon from the soma to
the growth cone. Two ordinary differential equations describe the
time-variation of the concentration of free tubulin in the growth cone and the
speed of elongation, respectively. All steady-state solutions of the model are
categorized. Given a set of the biological parameter values, it is shown how
one easily can infer whether there exist zero, one or two steady-state
solutions and directly determine the possible steady-state lengths of the axon.
Explicit expressions are given for each stationary concentration distribution.
It is thereby easy to examine the influence of each biological parameter on a
steady state. Numerical simulations indicate that when there exist two steady
states, the one with shorter axon length is unstable and the longer is stable.
Another result is that, for nominal parameter values extracted from literature,
in a large portion of a fully grown axon the concentration of free tubulin is
lower than both concentrations in the soma and in the growth cone.

an international collaboration of researchers from eight countries. These
searches involve high precision measurements of radiation-induced temperature

\Ca[48]-depleted calcium molybdate ($\mathrm{^{48depl}Ca^{100}MoO_4}$) crystals
that are located in a deep underground laboratory in Korea. The \mohundred
nuclide was chosen for this \zeronubb decay search because of its high
$Q$-value and favorable nuclear matrix element. Tests have demonstrated that
\camo crystals produce the brightest scintillation light among all of the
molybdate crystals, both at room and at cryogenic temperatures.
$\mathrm{^{48depl}Ca^{100}MoO_4}$ crystals are being operated at milli-Kelvin
temperatures and read out via specially developed metallic-magnetic-calorimeter
(MMC) temperature sensors that have excellent energy resolution and relatively
fast response times. The excellent energy resolution provides good
discrimination of signal from backgrounds, and the fast response time is
important for minimizing the irreducible background caused by random
coincidence of two-neutrino double-beta decay events of \mohundred nuclei.
Comparisons of the scintillating-light and phonon yields and pulse shape
discrimination of the phonon signals will be used to provide redundant
rejection of alpha-ray-induced backgrounds. An effective Majorana neutrino mass
sensitivity that reaches the expected range of the inverted neutrino mass
hierarchy, i.e., 20-50 meV, could be achieved with a 200~kg array of

and it is consistent with $1/r$ scaling. They deduced this from the fact that
the convergence error obtained in reconstructing the luminosity function of
pulsars using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure is about $10^5$ times
larger for a distance exponent of two (corresponding to the inverse-square law)
compared to an exponent of one. When we applied the same technique to this
pulsar dataset with two different values for the trial luminosity function in
the zeroth iteration, we find that neither of them can reproduce a value of
$10^5$ for the ratio of the convergence error between these distance exponents.
We then reconstruct the differential pulsar luminosity function using
Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method after positing both an inverse-linear and an
inverse-square scalings with distance. We show this method cannot help in
discerning between the two exponents. Finally, when we tried to estimate the
power law exponent with a Bayesian regression procedure, we do not get a
best-fit value of one for the distance exponent. The model residuals obtained
from our fitting procedure are larger for the inverse-linear law compared to
the inverse-square law. Moreover, the observed pulsar flux cannot be
parameterized only by power-law functions of distance, period, and period
derivative. Therefore, we conclude from our analysis using multiple methods
that there is no evidence that the pulsar radio flux at 1400 MHz violates the

clusters observed in the Milky Way must have had small half-mass radii in the
past, and that they expanded due to the weak tidal field they spend most of
their lifetime in. Moreover, their mass functions must have been steeper in the
past but flattened significantly as a cause of mass segregation and tidal mass
loss.

a planar anode at distances ranging from 0.1 mm to 10.0 mm. A detailed study of
the time evolution of the breakdown volt-ampere characteristics was performed
for the first time. It revealed a slow streamer development phase in the
discharge. The results of a spectroscopic study of the visible light emission
of the breakdowns complement the measurements. The light emission from the

set benchmarks for breakdown-safe design of ionization detectors, such as

between the driving laser pulse and the highly relativistic electrons in its
wake. Since this phase depends on both the driver and the cavity length, the
effects of dephasing can be mitigated with appropriate tailoring of the plasma
density along propagation. Preceding studies have discussed the prospects of
continuous phase-locking in the linear wakefield regime. However, most
experiments are performed in the highly non-linear regime and rely on
self-guiding of the laser pulse. Due to the complexity of the driver evolution
in this regime it is much more difficult to achieve phase locking. As an
alternative we study the scenario of rapid rephasing in sharp density
transitions, as was recently demonstrated experimentally. Starting from a
phenomenological model we deduce expressions for the electron energy gain in
such density profiles. The results are in accordance with particle-in-cell

start addressing this issue, we have performed a systematic study of highly
reproducible single-crystal interfaces based on rubrene and Fx-TCNQ, a family
of molecules whose electron affinity can be tuned by increasing the fluorine

measurements reveals that the interfacial charge carrier density, resistivity,

with a higher affinity resulting in larger charge transfer. Although the
transport properties can be described consistently and quantitatively using a
mobility-edge model, we find that a quantitative analysis of charge transfer in

interfacial energy level alignment. We attribute the discrepancy to phenomena
known to affect the energetics of organic semiconductors, which are neglected
by a single-particle description, such as molecular relaxation and band-gap
renormalization due to screening. The systematic behavior of the
Fx-TCNQ/rubrene interfaces opens the possibility to investigate these phenomena
experimentally, under controlled conditions.

on the established presentation of such structures as algebras for monads on

functors between presheaf categories, which are a common generalisation of

shapeliness also gives a way to define the data and axioms of a structure

basic operations of the calculus. In this paper we do this for some of the

4-dimensional elasticity, both with a variational procedure introduced by C.
Lanczos (1949,1962) in order to relate potentials to Lagrange multipliers.
Using the methods of Algebraic Analysis, namely mixing differential geometry
with homological algebra and combining the double duality test involved with
the Spencer cohomology, we shall be able to extend these results to an
arbitrary situation with an arbitrary dimension n. We shall also explain why
double duality is perfectly adapted to variational calculus with differential
constraints as a way to eliminate the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. For
example, the canonical parametrization of the stress equations is just
described by the formal adjoint of the n2(n2 -- 1)/12 components of the
linearized Riemann tensor considered as a linear second order differential
operator but the minimum number of potentials needed in elasticity theory is
equal to n(n -- 1)/2 for any minimal parametrization. Meanwhile, we can provide
all the above results without even using indices for writing down explicit
formulas in the way it is done in any textbook today. The example of
relativistic continuum mechanics with n = 4 is provided in order to prove that
it could be strictly impossible to obtain such results without using the above
methods. We also revisit the possibility (Maxwell equations of electromag-
netism) or the impossibility (Einstein equations of gravitation) to obtain
canonical or minimal parametrizations for various other equations of physics.
It is nevertheless important to notice that, when n and the algorithms
presented are known, most of the calculations can be achieved by using
computers for the corresponding symbolic computations. Finally, though the
paper is mathematically oriented as it aims providing new insights towards the
mathematical foundations of elasticity theory and mathematical physics, it is
written in a rather self-contained way.

on a method for calculating convex-roofs of rank two density matrices. It
iteratively considers the decompositions of the density matrix into two states
each, exploiting the knowledge for the rank-two case. The algorithm is
therefore quasi exact as far as the two rank case is concerned, and it also
gives hints where it should include more states in the decomposition of the
density matrix. Focusing on the threetangle, I show the results the algorithm
gives for two states, one of which being the $GHZ$-Werner state, for which the
exact convex roof is known. It overestimates the threetangle in the state,
thereby giving insight into the optimal decomposition the $GHZ$-Werner state
has. As a proof of principle, I have run the algorithm for the threetangle on
the transverse quantum Ising model. I give qualitative and quantitative
arguments why the convex roof should be close to the upper bound found here.

mystery. The proton dip model describes their spectral shape in the energy
range above $10^9$ GeV by pair production and photohadronic interactions with
the cosmic microwave background. The photohadronic interactions also produce
cosmogenic neutrinos peaking around $10^9$ GeV. We test whether this model is
still viable in light of recent UHECR spectrum measurements from the Telescope
Array experiment, and upper limits on the cosmogenic neutrino flux from
IceCube. While two-parameter fits have been already presented, we perform a
full scan of the three main physical model parameters: source redshift
evolution, injected proton maximal energy, and spectral index. We find
qualitatively different conclusions compared to earlier two-parameter fits in
the literature: a mild preference for a maximal energy cutoff at the sources
instead of the Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, hard injection spectra,
and strong source evolution. The predicted cosmogenic neutrino flux exceeds the
IceCube limit for any parameter combination. As a result, the proton dip model
is challenged at more than 95\% C.L. This is strong evidence against this model
independent of mass composition measurements.

fixed-boundary plasma equilibria in toroidally axisymmetric geometries. To
achieve this we apply the mimetic spectral element formulation presented in
[56] to the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation. This approach combines a
finite volume discretization with the mixed finite element method. In this way
the discrete differential operators ($\nabla$, $\nabla\times$, $\nabla\cdot$)
can be represented exactly and metric and all approximation errors are present
in the constitutive relations. The result of this formulation is an arbitrary
order method even on highly curved meshes. Additionally, the integral of the
\reviewerone{toroidal current $J_{\phi}$} is exactly equal to the boundary
integral of the poloidal field over the plasma boundary. This property can play
an important role in the coupling between equilibrium and transport solvers.
The proposed solver is tested on a varied set of plasma cross-sections (smooth
and with an X-point) and also for a wide range of pressure and
\reviewertwo{toroidal magnetic flux profiles}. Equilibria accurate up to
machine precision are obtained. Optimal algebraic convergence rates of order
$(p+1)$ and geometric convergence rates are shown for Soloviev solutions

and spheromak analytical solutions. The robustness of the method is
demonstrated for non-linear test cases, in particular on an equilibrium
solution with a pressure pedestal.

potential, with particular emphasis on the Haldane model, its phase diagram,
and the breakdown of the Peierls substitution. Tunable honeycomb lattices,
characterized by movable Dirac points, are also considered. Finally, general
considerations for dealing with the interaction terms are presented.

induced subgraph with a given property of the input graph. Examples of such
problems include maximum independent set, maximum planar graph, and many
others. We consider these problems, where the vertices are presented online.
With each vertex, the online algorithm must decide whether to include it into
the constructed subgraph, based only on the subgraph induced by the vertices
presented so far. We study the properties that are common to all these problems
by investigating the generalized problem: for a hereditary property \pty, find
some maximal induced subgraph having \pty. We study this problem from the point
of view of advice complexity. Using a result from Boyar et al. [STACS 2015], we
give a tight trade-off relationship stating that for inputs of length n roughly
n/c bits of advice are both needed and sufficient to obtain a solution with
competitive ratio c, regardless of the choice of \pty, for any c (possibly a
function of n). Surprisingly, a similar result cannot be obtained for the
symmetric problem: for a given cohereditary property \pty, find a minimum
subgraph having \pty. We show that the advice complexity of this problem varies
significantly with the choice of \pty.
  We also consider preemptive online model, where the decision of the algorithm
is not completely irreversible. In particular, the algorithm may discard some
vertices previously assigned to the constructed set, but discarded vertices
cannot be reinserted into the set again. We show that, for the maximum induced
subgraph problem, preemption cannot help much, giving a lower bound of
$\Omega(n/(c^2\log c))$ bits of advice needed to obtain competitive ratio $c$,
where $c$ is any increasing function bounded by \sqrt{n/log n}. We also give a
linear lower bound for c close to 1.

analytics has given rise to serious privacy concerns, related to wide scale
electronic surveillance, profiling, and disclosure of private data. To reap the
benefits of analytics without invading the individuals' private sphere, it is
essential to draw the limits of big data processing and integrate data
protection safeguards in the analytics value chain. ENISA, with the current
report, supports this approach and the position that the challenges of
technology (for big data) should be addressed by the opportunities of
technology (for privacy).
  We first explain the need to shift from ""big data versus privacy"" to ""big
data with privacy"". In this respect, the concept of privacy by design is key to
identify the privacy requirements early in the big data analytics value chain
and in subsequently implementing the necessary technical and organizational
measures.
  After an analysis of the proposed privacy by design strategies in the
different phases of the big data value chain, we review privacy enhancing
technologies of special interest for the current and future big data landscape.
In particular, we discuss anonymization, the ""traditional"" analytics technique,
the emerging area of encrypted search and privacy preserving computations,
granular access control mechanisms, policy enforcement and accountability, as
well as data provenance issues. Moreover, new transparency and access tools in
big data are explored, together with techniques for user empowerment and
control.
  Achieving ""big data with privacy"" is no easy task and a lot of research and
implementation is still needed. Yet, it remains a possible task, as long as all
the involved stakeholders take the necessary steps to integrate privacy and
data protection safeguards in the heart of big data, by design and by default.

The orientation of the secondary radio structures shows a strong connection
with the optical axis, with all (but one) wing forming a angle larger than 40
degrees with the host major axis. The probability that this is compatible with
a uniform distribution is P = 0.9 10E-4. Spectra are available from the SDSS
for 28 XRSs. We modeled them to extract information on their emission lines and
stellar population properties. The sample is formed by approximately the same
number of high and low excitation galaxies (HEG and LEG); this classification
is essential for a proper comparison with non-winged radio-galaxies. XRSs
follow the same relations between radio and line luminosity defined by
radio-galaxies in the 3C sample. While in HEGs a young stellar population is
often present, this is not detected in the 13 LEGs, again in agreement with the
properties of non XRSs. The lack of young stars in LEGs support the idea that
they did not experiences a recent gas rich merger. The connection between the
optical axis and the wings orientation, as well as the stellar population and
emission lines properties, provide further support for an hydro-dynamic origin

dispersive and anisotropic tensor, which complicates most modeling
methodologies. In this paper, a novel equivalent circuit model is proposed for
graphene with the magnetostatic bias based on the electric field integral
equation (EFIE). To characterize the anisotropic property of the biased
graphene, the resistive part of the unit circuit is replaced by a resistor in
series with current control voltage sources (CCVSs). The CCVSs account for the
off-diagonal parts of the surface conductivity tensor for the magnetized
graphene. Furthermore, the definitions of the absorption cross section and the
scattering cross section are revisited to make them feasible for derived
circuit analysis. This proposed method is benchmarked with several numerical
examples. This paper also provides a new equivalent circuit model to deal with
dispersive and anisotropic materials.

tidally disrupted. Previous studies of such ""tidal disruption event"" (TDE)
mostly focus on the stellar debris that are bound to the system, because they
give rise to luminous flares. On the other hand, half of the stellar debris in
principle are unbound and can stream to a great distance, but so far there is
no clear evidence that this ""unbound debris stream"" (UDS) exists. Motivated by
the fact that the circum-nuclear region around SMBHs is usually filled with
dense molecular clouds (MCs), here we investigate the observational signatures
resulting from the collision between an UDS and a MC, which is likely to happen
hundreds of years after a TDE. We focus on $\gamma$-ray emission ($0.1-10^5$
GeV), which comes from the encounter of shock-accelerated cosmic rays with
background protons and, more importantly, is not subject to extinction. We show
that because of the high proton density inside a MC, the peak $\gamma$-ray
luminosity, about $10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, is at least $100$ times greater
than that in the case without a MC (only with a smooth interstellar medium).
The luminosity decays on a time-scale of decades, depending on the distance of
the MC, and about a dozen of these ""TDE afterglows"" could be detected within a
distance of about $16$ Mpc by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. Without
careful discrimination, these sources potentially could contaminate the
searches for starburt galaxies, galactic nuclei containing millisecond pulsars
or dark-matter annihilation signals.

the existence of wave patterns, such as kinks, solitons, compactons, peakons
and many others. There are known numerous nonlinear evolutionary PDEs,
supporting soliton (multi-soliton) and compacton traveling wave (TW) solutions.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of the models, with the exception of
completely integrable ones, do not enable to analyze the properties of solitary
waves interaction using only qualitative methods. Therefore it is instructive,
when dealing with the non-integrable PDEs, to combine the qualitative treatment
with numerical simulations. In this report we are going to present the results
of studying compacton solutions in the continual models for granular
pre-stressed chains. The model is shown to possess a pair of compacton TW
solutions which are the bright and dark compactons. First we consider the
stability properties of the compacton solutions and show that both the bright
and the dark compactons pass the stability test. Next we analyze the dynamics
of the compactons, simulating numerically the temporal evolution of a single
compacton, a well as the interection of pairs of compactons, including
bright-bright, dark-dark and bright-dark pairs. To be able to simulate the
evolutin of interacting compactons, we have modified the numerical scheme built
by J. de Frutos, M. A. Lopez-Marcos, and J. M. Sanz-Serna. Results of
simulations are compared with that of evolution of corresponding impulse in the
granular pre-stressed chain.

hypothesized to arise in most of the commonly studied models of random

optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide,
undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of
silicon photonics Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Using embedded transparent
detectors and a progressive tuning algorithm, the mesh self-configures
automatically and reset itself after significantly perturbing the mixing,
without turning off the beams. We demonstrate the recovery of four separate 10
Gbits/s information channels, with residual cross-talk between beams of -20dB.
This principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should
be applicable in a wide range of optical applications.

evolution as well as in drug design and development. The protein 3D structure
has been shown to be effective with respect to classifying proteins. Prior work
has shown that the Double Centroid Reduced Representation (DCRR) model is a
useful geometric representation for protein structure with respect to visual
models, reducing the quantity of modeled information for each amino acid, yet
retaining the most important geometrical and chemical features of each: the
centroids of the backbone and of the side-chain. DCRR has not yet been applied
in the calculation of geometric structural similarity. Meanwhile,
multi-dimensional indexing (MDI) of protein structure combines protein
structural analysis with distance metrics to facilitate structural similarity
queries and is also used for clustering protein structures into related groups.
In this respect, the combination of geometric models with MDI has been shown to
be effective. Prior work, notably Distance and Density based Protein Indexing
(DDPIn), applies MDI to protein models based on the geometry of the CA
backbone. DDPIn distance metrics are based on radial and density functions that
incorporate spherical-based metrics, and the indices are built from metric tree
(M-tree) structures. This work combines DCRR with DDPIn for the development of
new DCRR centroid-based metrics: spherical binning distance and inter-centroid
spherical distance. The use of DCRR models will provide additional significant
structural information via the inclusion of side-chain centroids. Additionally,
the newly developed distance metric functions combined with DCRR and M-tree
indexing attempt to improve upon the performance of prior work (DDPIn), given
the same data set, with respect to both individual k-nearest neighbor (kNN)
search queries as well as clustering all proteins in the index.
