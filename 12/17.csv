balanced if there is a bipartition of its vertex set such that an edge has sign
$-$ if and only if its endpoints are in different parts. The Edwards-Erd\""os
bound states that every graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges has a balanced
subgraph with at least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{n-1}{4}$ edges. In the Signed Max Cut
Above Tight Lower Bound (Signed Max Cut ATLB) problem, given a signed graph $G$
and a parameter $k$, the question is whether $G$ has a balanced subgraph with
at least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{n-1}{4}+\frac{k}{4}$ edges. This problem
generalizes Max Cut Above Tight Lower Bound, for which a kernel with $O(k^5)$
vertices was given by Crowston et al. [ICALP 2012, Algorithmica 2015]. Crowston
et al. [TCS 2013] improved this result by providing a kernel with $O(k^3)$
vertices for the more general Signed Max Cut ATLB problem. In this article we
are interested in improving the size of the kernels for Signed Max Cut ATLB on
restricted graph classes for which the problem remains hard. For two integers
$r,\ell \geq 0$, a graph $G$ is an $(r,\ell)$-graph if $V(G)$ can be
partitioned into $r$ independent sets and $\ell$ cliques. Building on the
techniques of Crowston et al. [TCS 2013], we provide a kernel with $O(k^2)$
vertices on $(r,\ell)$-graphs for any fixed $r,\ell \geq 0$, and a simple
linear kernel on subclasses of split graphs for which we prove that the problem
is still NP-hard.

of compositional data. It provides new results about theoretical properties of

that the weighted arithmetic mean is the only central tendency characteristic
satisfying a small set of axioms, namely continuity, reflexivity and marginal
stability. Moreover, this set of axioms also implies that the weights must be
identical for all parts of the composition. This result has deep consequences
on the spatial multivariate covariance modeling of compositional data. In a
geostatistical setting, it is shown as a second result that the proportional
model of covariance functions (i.e., the product of a covariance matrix and a
single correlation function) is the only model that provides identical kriging
weights for all components of the compositional data. As a consequence of these
two results, the proportional model of covariance function is the only
covariance model compatible with reflexivity and marginal stability.

challenges: lack of training data, large number of fine-grained categories, and
high intraclass vs. low inter-class variance. In this work we propose a generic
iterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping
that handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in
the loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on
manifolds for each category. These anchor points capture intra-class variances
and remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high
confidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing
with exemplar images, labelers mark each candidate image as either a ""true
positive"" or a ""false positive"". True positives are added into our current
dataset and false positives are regarded as ""hard negatives"" for our metric
learning model. Then the model is retrained with an expanded dataset and hard
negatives for the next round. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, we bootstrap a fine-grained flower dataset with 620 categories from
Instagram images. The proposed deep metric learning scheme is evaluated on both
our dataset and the CUB-200-2001 Birds dataset. Experimental evaluations show
significant performance gain using dataset bootstrapping and demonstrate

missing tag detection to reduce and avoid inventory shrinkage. In this
application, promptly finding out the missing event is of paramount importance.
However, existing missing tag detection protocols cannot efficiently handle the
presence of a large number of unexpected tags whose IDs are not known to the
reader, which shackles the time efficiency. To deal with the problem of
detecting missing tags in the presence of unexpected tags, this paper
introduces a two-phase Bloom filter-based missing tag detection protocol
(BMTD). The proposed BMTD exploits Bloom filter in sequence to first deactivate
the unexpected tags and then test the membership of the expected tags, thus
dampening the interference from the unexpected tags and considerably reducing
the detection time. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the protocol
parameters is performed to minimize the detection time of the proposed BMTD and
achieve the required reliability simultaneously. Extensive experiments are then
conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BMTD. The results
demonstrate that the proposed BMTD significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions.

Essentially, depending on the coupling between the dilaton and the fundamental

decoupling at all to a total decoupling state. In this latter case, the theory
becomes indistinguishable from general relativity (in the dust limit), as all
dilatonic effects can be re-absorbed through a simple change of unit.
  Furthermore, for particular decouplings, we show that the phenomenology used
to constrain theories from universality of free fall observations is
significantly different from what is commonly used. Finally, from a fundamental
perspective, the class of non-dynamical decouplings proposed in this paper
might play a role in the current non-observation of any deviation from general

These forces can cool the motion and, above a threshold value of the laser
intensity, induce spatial ordering. We show that the relaxation dynamics
following the quench exhibits a long prethermalizing behaviour which is first
dominated by coherent long-range forces, and then by their interplay with
dissipation. Remarkably, dissipation-assisted prethermalization is orders of
magnitude longer than prethermalization due to the coherent dynamics. We show
that it is associated with the creation of momentum-position correlations,
which remain nonzero for even longer times than mean-field predicts. This
implies that cavity cooling of an atomic ensemble into the selforganized phase

exemplified on four losses that bear popular names in various fields:
exponential (boosting), mean-variance (finance), Linear Hinge (on-line
learning), ReLU (deep learning), and unhinged (statistics). Second, we show
that the generalization unveils a surprising new connection to regularized
learning, and in particular a sufficient condition under which regularizing the
loss over examples is equivalent to regularizing the rados (with Minkowski
sums) in the equivalent rado loss. This brings simple and powerful rado-based
learning algorithms for sparsity-controlling regularization, that we exemplify
on a boosting algorithm for the regularized exponential rado-loss, which
formally boosts over four types of regularization, including the popular ridge
and lasso, and the recently coined slope --- we obtain the first proven
boosting algorithm for this last regularization. Through our first contribution
on the equivalence of rado and example-based losses, Omega-R.AdaBoost~appears
to be an efficient proxy to boost the regularized logistic loss over examples
using whichever of the four regularizers. Experiments display that
regularization consistently improves performances of rado-based learning, and
may challenge or beat the state of the art of example-based learning even when
learning over small sets of rados. Finally, we connect regularization to
differential privacy, and display how tiny budgets can be afforded on big
domains while beating (protected) example-based learning.

many believe that this is just a matter of time and effort, a different
approach might help. Here, we describe a very simple idea which explains the
power of the brain as well as its structure, exploiting complex dynamics rather
than abstracting it away. Just as a Turing Machine is a Universal Digital
Computer operating in a world of symbols, we propose that the brain is a
Universal Dynamical Systems Modeller, evolved bottom-up (itself using nested
networks of interconnected, self-organised dynamical systems) to prosper in a
world of dynamical systems.
  Recent progress in Applied Mathematics has produced startling evidence of
what happens when abstract Dynamical Systems interact. Key latent information
describing system A can be extracted by system B from very simple signals, and
signals can be used by one system to control and manipulate others. Using these
facts, we show how a region of the neocortex uses its dynamics to intrinsically
""compute"" about the external and internal world.
  Building on an existing ""static"" model of cortical computation (Hawkins'
Hierarchical Temporal Memory - HTM), we describe how a region of neocortex can
be viewed as a network of components which together form a Dynamical Systems
modelling module, connected via sensory and motor pathways to the external
world, and forming part of a larger dynamical network in the brain.
  Empirical modelling and simulations of Dynamical HTM are possible with simple
extensions and combinations of currently existing open source software. We list
a number of relevant projects.

expected to be a rich source of information on cosmological reheating and
reionizaton. However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must
extract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally
smooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used
single antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent
structure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)
as well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier
output. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using
cross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration
techniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles
driving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We
prove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the
setup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i.e. the signal picked up at
one antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to
thermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers or the ground) radiating
into both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup, one cannot suppress
cross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing sensitivity to the
global signal by the same factor -- instead, the challenge is to characterize
these effects and their frequency dependence. We illustrate our general theorem
by explicit calculations within toy setups consisting of two short dipole
antennas in free space and above a perfectly reflecting ground surface, as well
as two well-separated identical lossless antennas arranged to achieve zero
cross-talk.

atoms, where one is in the excited state and the other in the ground state.
They interact with the quantum electromagnetic field in the vacuum state and
are placed in a photonic-bandgap environment with a dispersion relation
quadratic near the gap edge and linear for low frequencies, while the atomic
transition frequency is assumed to be inside the photonic gap and near its
lower edge. This problem is strictly related to the coherent resonant energy
transfer between atoms in external environments. The analysis involves both an
isotropic three-dimensional model and the one-dimensional case. The resonance
interaction asymptotically decays faster with distance compared to the
free-space case, specifically as $1/r^2$ compared to the $1/r$ free-space
dependence in the three-dimensional case, and as $1/r$ compared to the
oscillatory dependence in free space for the one-dimensional case. Nonetheless,
the interaction energy remains significant and much stronger than dispersion
interactions between atoms. On the other hand, spontaneous emission is strongly
suppressed by the environment and the correlated state is thus preserved by the
spontaneous-decay decoherence effects. We conclude that our configuration is
suitable for observing the elusive quantum resonance interaction between
entangled atoms.

stars in globular clusters (GCs) require significant mass-loss ($\ge95\%$) to
explain the observed fraction of such stars. In the GCs of the Fornax dwarf
galaxy significant mass-loss could be a problem. Larsen et al. (2012) showed
that there is a large ratio of GCs to metal-poor field stars in Fornax and
about $20-25\%$ of all the stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}<-2$ belong to the four
metal-poor GCs. This imposes an upper limit of $\sim80\%$ mass-loss that could
have happened in Fornax GCs. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by suggesting that stars can leave the Fornax galaxy. We use a series
of $N$-body simulations, to determine the limit of mass-loss from Fornax as a
function of the initial orbital radii of GCs and the speed with which stars
leave Fornax GCs. We consider a set of cored and cuspy density profiles for
Fornax. Our results show that with a cuspy model for Fornax, the fraction of
stars which leave the galaxy, can be as high as $\sim90\%$, when the initial
orbital radii of GCs are $R=2-3\,\rm{kpc}$ and the initial speed of stars is
$v>20\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We show that such large velocities can be achieved by
gas expulsion induced mass-loss but not stellar evolution induced mass-loss.
Our results imply that one cannot interpret the metallicity distribution of
Fornax field stars as evidence against significant mass-loss in Fornax GCs, if
mass-loss is due to gas expulsion.

narrow band slit-jaw (SJI) imaging of the solar chromosphere and transition
region at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Combined with
high-resolution context spectral imaging of the photosphere and chromosphere as
provided by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), we can now effectively trace
dynamic phenomena through large parts of the solar atmosphere in both space and
time. IRIS SJI 1400 images from active regions, which primarily sample the
transition region with the Si IV 1394 and 1403 {\AA} lines, reveal ubiquitous
bright ""grains"" which are short-lived (2-5 min) bright roundish small patches
of sizes 0.5-1.7"" that generally move limbward with velocities up to about 30
km s$^{-1}$. In this paper we show that many bright grains are the result of
chromospheric shocks impacting the transition region. These shocks are
associated with dynamic fibrils (DFs), most commonly observed in H{\alpha}. We
find that the grains show strongest emission in the ascending phase of the DF,
that the emission is strongest towards the top of the DF and that the grains
correspond to a blueshift and broadening of the Si IV lines. We note that the
SJI 1400 grains can also be observed in the SJI 1330 channel which is dominated
by C II lines. Our observations show that a significant part of the active
region transition region dynamics is driven from the chromosphere below rather
than from coronal activity above. We conclude that the shocks that drive DFs
also play an important role in the heating of the upper chromosphere and lower
transition region.

on the hyper-honeycomb lattice, which hosts both gapped and gapless spin liquid
phases with an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The latter has an unusual
gapless spectrum of Majorana fermion excitations, with a co-dimension-two Fermi
ring. We thus address the question of the interplay of topological physics and
disorder by considering the properties of isolated single and pair of
vacancies. We show that near the vacancies, the local magnetic response to a
field $h_z$ is parametrically enhanced in comparison to the pristine bulk.
Unlike the previously studied case of the 2D honeycomb Kitaev model, the
vacancies do not bind a flux of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. In the gapped
phase, an isolated vacancy gives rise to effectively free spin-half moments
with a non-universal coupling to an external field. In the gapless phase, the
low-field magnetization is suppressed parametrically, to $(-\ln h_z)^{-1/2}$
because of interactions with the surrounding spin-liquid. We also show that a
pair of vacancies is subject to a sublattice-dependent interaction on account
of coupling through the bulk spin liquid, which is spatially anisotropic even
when all Kitaev couplings have equal strength. This coupling is thus
exponentially suppressed with distance in the gapped phase. In the gapless
phase, two vacancies on the same (opposite) sublattice exhibit an enhanced
(suppressed) low-field response, amounting to an effectively
(anti-)ferromagnetic interaction.

and power-law decays in time were found for natural and hard cutoffs,

topological inhomogeneities. Optimal fluctuation theory considering
sample-to-sample fluctuations of the pseudo thresholds is presented to explain
the observed slow dynamics. A quasistationary analysis shows that response
functions remain bounded at $\lambda_2$. We argue these to be signals of a
smeared transition. However, in the thermodynamic limit the Griffiths effects
loose their relevancy and have a conventional critical point at $\lambda_c=0$.

exhibit spatially-varying reflectance. We assume that multiple images of the
object are obtained under a fixed view-point and varying illumination, i.e.,
the setting of photometric stereo. At the core of our techniques is the
assumption that the BRDF at each pixel lies in the non-negative span of a known
BRDF dictionary.This assumption enables a per-pixel surface normal and BRDF
estimation framework that is computationally tractable and requires no
initialization in spite of the underlying problem being non-convex. Our
estimation framework first solves for the surface normal at each pixel using a
variant of example-based photometric stereo. We design an efficient multi-scale
search strategy for estimating the surface normal and subsequently, refine this
estimate using a gradient descent procedure. Given the surface normal estimate,
we solve for the spatially-varying BRDF by constraining the BRDF at each pixel
to be in the span of the BRDF dictionary, here, we use additional priors to
further regularize the solution. A hallmark of our approach is that it does not
require iterative optimization techniques nor the need for careful
initialization, both of which are endemic to most state-of-the-art techniques.

are three of them that sum to zero. Until a recent breakthrough by Gr{\o}nlund
and Pettie [FOCS'14], a simple $\Theta(n^2)$-time deterministic algorithm for
this problem was conjectured to be optimal. Over the years many algorithmic
problems have been shown to be reducible from the 3SUM problem or its variants,
including the more generalized forms of the problem, such as $k$-SUM and
$k$-variate linear degeneracy testing ($k$-LDT). The conjectured hardness of
these problems have become extremely popular for basing conditional lower
bounds for numerous algorithmic problems in P.
  In this paper, we show that the randomized $4$-linear decision tree
complexity of 3SUM is $O(n^{3/2})$, and that the randomized $(2k-2)$-linear
decision tree complexity of $k$-SUM and $k$-LDT is $O(n^{k/2})$, for any odd

$O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n})$ and $O(n^{k/2}\sqrt{\log n})$ decision tree bounds
obtained by Gr{\o}nlund and Pettie. Our technique includes a specialized
randomized variant of fractional cascading data structure. Additionally, we
give another deterministic algorithm for 3SUM that runs in $O(n^2 \log\log n /
\log n )$ time. The latter bound matches a recent independent bound by Freund
[Algorithmica 2017], but our algorithm is somewhat simpler, due to a better use

length), the rescaled SLRDs are given by log-normal distributions, with their
$n$th cumulant scaling as $(\xi/l)^{(n-1)d_s}$. This give rise to an
interesting temporal scaling for such cumulants $\left\langle w_n

= \left[ 2 n + {(n-1)d_s}/{\alpha} \right] \beta$. This scaling is analytically
proved for the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and Random Deposition interfaces, and
numerically confirmed for other classes. In general, it is featured by small
corrections and, thus, it yields exponents $\gamma_n$'s (and, consequently,
$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $z$) in nice agreement with their respective universality
class. Thus, it is an useful framework for numerical and experimental
investigations, where it is, usually, hard to estimate the dynamic $z$ and
mainly the (global) roughness $\alpha$ exponents. The stationary (for $\xi \gg

and, for some models, strong finite-size corrections are found. However, we
demonstrate that good evidences of their universality can be obtained through
successive extrapolations of their cumulant ratios for long times and large

high-density patches, providing a biased tracer of the linear matter density

perturbative series in the average overdensity of the Lagrangian patch. In more
realistic models, however, additional quantities will affect the clustering of
halo-patches, and this expansion becomes a function of several stochastic
variables. In this paper, we present a general multivariate expansion scheme
that can parametrize the clustering of any biased Lagrangian tracer, given only
the variables involved and their symmetry (in our case rotational invariance).
This approach is based on an expansion in the orthonormal polynomials
associated with the relevant variables, so that no renormalization of the
coefficients ever occurs. We provide explicit expression for the series
coefficients, or Lagrangian bias parameters, in the case of peaks of the linear

effective theory describing low-energy QCD reduces to that of quantum mechanics
on the coset manifold, which is the so-called delta regime of chiral
perturbation theory. We solve this quantum mechanics analytically for the case
of a $U(1)_L \times U(1)_R$ subgroup of chiral symmetry, and numerically for
the case of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. We utilize the quantum mechanical
spectrum to compute the mass gap and chiral condensate, and investigate
symmetry restoration in a finite spatial volume as a function of temperature.
Because we obtain the spectrum for non-zero values of the quark mass, we are
able to interpolate between the rigid rotor limit, which emerges at vanishing
quark mass, and the harmonic approximation, which is referred to as the
p-regime. We find that the applicability of perturbation theory about the rotor
limit largely requires lighter-than-physical quarks. As a stringent check of
our results, we raise the temperature to that of the inverse cube size. When
this condition is met, the quantum mechanics reduces to a matrix model. The
condensate we obtain in this limit agrees with that determined analytically in

studies the homogeneous case. We then find conditions under which the
mean-field approximation of a chosen epidemic process stabilizes to extinction
exponentially quickly. Leveraging this result, we formulate and solve an
optimal resource allocation problem in which we minimize the expenditure
necessary to force a chosen epidemic process to become extinct as quickly as
possible. In the case that the budget is not sufficient to ensure extinction of
the desired process, we instead minimize a useful heuristic. We explore the
efficacy of our methods by comparing simulations of the stochastic process to

stages of the original Bilinear-CNN architecture completely removes the

observe that a better embedding can be learned by performing bilinear pooling
in a more local way, where each pooling is confined to a predefined region. Our
architecture thus represents a compromise between traditional convolutional
networks and bilinear CNNs and strikes a balance between rigid matching and
completely ignoring spatial information.

baselines that include Bilinear-CNN as well as prior art. The new architecture
outperforms the baseline on all three datasets, while performing better than

called agents, arbitrarily positioned at some nodes of a graph, must cooperate
so that each node is eventually visited by at least one agent. In the
literature, the main focus has been on graphs that are static; that is, the
topology is either invariant in time or subject to localized changes. The few
studies on exploration of dynamic graphs have been almost all limited to the
centralized case (i.e., assuming complete a priori knowledge of the changes and
the times of their occurrence). We investigate the decentralized exploration of
dynamic graphs (i.e., when the agents are unaware of the location and timing of
the changes) focusing, in this paper, on dynamic systems whose underlying graph
is a ring. We first consider the fully-synchronous systems traditionally
assumed in the literature; i.e., all agents are active at each time step. We
then introduce the notion of semi-synchronous systems, where only a subset of
agents might be active at each time step (the choice of the subset is made by
an adversary); this model is common in the context of mobile agents in
continuous spaces but has never been studied before for agents moving in
graphs. Our main focus is on the impact that the level of synchrony as well as
other factors such as anonymity, knowledge of the size of the ring, and
chirality (i.e., common orientation) have on the solvability of the problem,
focusing on the minimum number of agents necessary. We draw an extensive map of
feasibility, and of complexity in terms of minimum number of agent movements.
All our sufficiency proofs are constructive, and almost all our solution
protocols are asymptotically optimal.

chiral modes imprinted by the domain wall. Moreover, we find that, when
compared with the recently discovered spin-orbit torque-induced domain-wall
motion in heavy metals, the reflection coefficient plays the role of an
effective spin-Hall angle governing the efficiency of the proposed electrical
control of domain walls. Quantitatively, this effective spin-Hall angle is
found to approach a universal value of $2$, providing an efficient scheme to
reconfigure the domain-wall chiral interconnects for possible memory and logic
applications.

$\mathbb{R}$ that evolves according to a space and environment dependent
Langevin dynamic. The interaction between two spins depends on the spin values,
on the spatial distance and the random environment of both spins. We prove the
path large deviation principle from the hydrodynamic (or local mean field
McKean-Vlasov) limit and derive different expressions of the rate function for
the empirical process and for the empirical measure of the paths. To this end,
we generalize an approach of Dawson and G\""artner. By the space and random
environment dependency, this requires new ingredients compared to mean field
type interactions. Moreover, we prove the large deviation principle by using a
second approach. This requires a generalisation of Varadhan's lemma to nowhere
continuous functions.

notion of ""recoverability."" In particular, the fidelity of recovery quantifies
how well one can recover a system $A$ of a tripartite quantum state, defined on
systems $ABC$, by acting on system $C$ alone. The relative entropy of recovery
is an associated measure in which the fidelity is replaced by relative entropy.
In this paper, we provide concrete operational interpretations of the
aforementioned recovery measures in terms of a computational decision problem
and a hypothesis testing scenario. Specifically, we show that the fidelity of
recovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a computationally
unbounded quantum prover can convince a computationally bounded quantum
verifier that a given quantum state is recoverable. The quantum interactive
proof system giving this operational meaning requires four messages exchanged
between the prover and verifier, but by forcing the prover to perform his
actions in superposition, we construct a different proof system that requires
only two messages. The result is that the associated decision problem is in
QIP(2) and another argument establishes it as hard for QSZK (both classes
contain problems believed to be difficult to solve for a quantum computer). We
finally prove that the regularized relative entropy of recovery is equal to the
optimal Type II error exponent when trying to distinguish many copies of a
tripartite state from a recovered version of this state, such that the Type I
error is constrained to be no larger than a constant.

state observed by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS around a diphoton invariant
mass of 750 GeV. The interpretation of the excess as a spin-zero s-channel
resonance implies model-independent lower bounds on both its branching ratio
and its coupling to photons, which stringently constrain dynamical models. We
consider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and a broad
resonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed
couplings and branching fractions to final states other than diphotons, by
including the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts
to construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific
models, our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the
presence of only an additional singlet or doublet spin-zero field and the
Standard Model degrees of freedom; this includes all two-Higgs-doublet models.
Likewise, heavy scalars in the MSSM cannot explain the excess if stability of
the electroweak vacuum is required, at least in a leading-order analysis. If we
assume that the resonance is broad we find that it is challenging to find a
weakly coupled explanation. However, we provide an existence proof in the form
of a model with vectorlike quarks with large electric charge that is
perturbative up to the 100 TeV scale. For the narrow-resonance case a similar
model can be perturbative up to high scales also with smaller charges. We also
find that, in their simplest form, dilaton models cannot explain the size of
the excess. Some implications for flavor physics are briefly discussed.

the superpartner of the Goldstone mode of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking,
the goldstino. The sgoldstino is produced at the LHC via gluon fusion and
decays to photons, with interaction strengths proportional to the corresponding
gaugino masses over the supersymmetry breaking scale. Fitting the excess, while
evading bounds from searches in the di-jet, $Z\gamma$, $ZZ$ and $WW$ final
states, selects the supersymmetry breaking scale to be a few TeV, and
particular ranges for the gaugino masses. The two real scalars, corresponding
to the CP-even and CP-odd parts of the complex sgoldstino, both have narrow
widths, but their masses can be split of the order 10-30 GeV by electroweak
mixing corrections, which could account for the preference of a wider resonance
width in the current low-statistics data. In the parameter space under

addition to the standard $D$-term contribution proportional to the $Z$-boson
mass, which can significantly enhance the tree level Higgs mass.

years ago, inspired by sol-gel transitions. We investigate a version of the
model on the triangular lattice, where connected components stop growing
(""freeze"") as soon as they contain at least $N$ vertices, for some parameter $N
\geq 1$.
  This process has a substantially different behavior from the diameter-frozen
process, studied in previous works: in particular, we show that many (more and
more as $N \to \infty$) frozen clusters surrounding the origin appear
successively, each new cluster having a diameter much smaller than the previous
one. This separation of scales is instrumental, and it helps to approximate the
process in sufficiently large (but not too large), as a function of $N$, finite
domains by a Markov chain. This allows us to establish a deconcentration
property for the sizes of the holes of the frozen clusters around the origin.
  For the full-plane process, we then show that it can be compared to the
process in large finite domains, so that the deconcentration property also
holds in this case. In particular, we obtain that with high probability (as $N
\to \infty$), the origin does not belong to a frozen cluster in the final
configuration.
  This work requires new properties for near-critical percolation, which we
develop along the way, and which are interesting in their own right: in
particular, an asymptotic formula involving the percolation probability
$\theta(p)$ as $p \searrow p_c$, and regularity properties for large holes in
the infinite cluster. Volume-frozen percolation also gives insight into
forest-fire processes, where lightning hits independently each tree with a

results allow us to distinguish three categories of projects: (i) New gas
sources developed and brought to the EU markets. These projects decrease prices
and increase SW in a large number of countries. The only project in this
category is the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline; (ii) Existing gas sources made
available to additional countries. This leads to an increase of SW in the newly

involve pipeline and regasification terminal capacity enhancements; (iii)
Projects with a marginal effect on the (fully functioning) market. Most storage
expansion projects fall into this category, plus the recently announced Turkish

realized, the EU's single market will become a reality in 2019. However, we

emphasize on measures to increase the available volumes, in particular once the
integration of the market is completed. At the same time, efficiency gains,

the dependency of the EU as a whole on external suppliers.

result in similar dark matter distributions. We present a general method to map
an ultraviolet complete or effective field theory of low energy dark matter
physics into parameters that affect the linear matter power spectrum and carry
out this mapping for several representative particle models. We further propose
a simple but useful choice for characterizing the dark matter self-interaction
transfer cross section that parametrizes self-scattering in structure formation
simulations. Taken together, these effective parameters in ETHOS allow the
classification of dark matter theories according to their structure formation
properties rather than their intrinsic particle properties, paving the way for

$\epsilon<4.5\times 10^{-3}$ at 95% C.L. The main obstacle to improving this
CMB-only result is strong degeneracy between $\epsilon$ and the physical matter
densities $\omega_{\rm b}$ and $\omega_{\rm c}$. A constraint on deuterium
abundance improves the limit to $\epsilon<1.8\times 10^{-3}$. Adding the Planck
high-multipole CMB polarisation and BAO data leads to a small improvement; with
this maximal dataset we obtain $\epsilon<1.3\times 10^{-3}$. This dataset
constrains the present dark radiation energy density to at most 12% of the
total photon plus dark radiation density. Finally, we discuss the degeneracy
between dark radiation and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm
eff}$, and consider the impact of dark radiation perturbations and allowing
$\epsilon<0$ on the results.

State-of-the-art fast-Fourier-transform spectrometers provide the necessary
data read-out speed, dynamic range, and spectral resolution to apply software
radio-frequency interference mitigation. EBHIS is corrected for stray radiation
and employs frequency-dependent flux-density calibration and sophisticated
baseline-removal techniques to ensure the highest possible data quality.
Detailed analyses of the resulting data products show that EBHIS is not only
outperforming LAB in terms of sensitivity and angular resolution, but also
matches the intensity-scale of LAB extremely well, allowing EBHIS to be used as
a drop-in replacement for LAB. Data products are made available to the public
in a variety of forms. Most important, we provide a properly gridded Milky Way
HI column density map in HEALPix representation. To maximize the usefulness of
EBHIS data, we estimate uncertainties in the HI column density and brightness

that all alternative models have only a negligible impact on large scale

affect the structure and abundance of subhaloes due to the combined effects of
small scale primordial damping in the power spectrum and late time
self-interactions. We derive an analytic mapping from the primordial damping
scale in the power spectrum to the cutoff scale in the halo mass function and
the kinetic decoupling temperature. We demonstrate that certain models within
this extended effective framework that can alleviate the too-big-to-fail and
missing satellite problems simultaneously, and possibly the core-cusp problem.
The primordial power spectrum cutoff of our models naturally creates a
diversity in the circular velocity profiles, which is larger than that found
for cold dark matter simulations. We show that the parameter space of models
can be constrained by contrasting model predictions to astrophysical
observations. For example, some models may be challenged by the missing
satellite problem if baryonic processes were to be included and even over-solve
the too-big-to-fail problem; thus ruling them out.

that the low-frequency quasi-periodic dynamo action introduces low-frequency
fluctuations in the Maxwell stresses which then drive the propagating
fluctuations. Examining both the mass accretion rate and emission proxies, we
recover log-normality, linear RMS-flux relations, and radial coherence that
would produce inter-band lags. Hence, we successful relate and connect the
phenomenology of propagating fluctuations to modern MHD accretion disk theory.

extension that provides scenarios for Higgs pair production with different
masses. The model has two interesting phases: the dark matter phase, with a
Standard Model-like Higgs boson, a new scalar and a dark matter candidate; and
the broken phase, with all three neutral scalars mixing. In the latter phase
Higgs decays into a pair of two different Higgs bosons are possible. In this
study we analyse Higgs-to-Higgs decays in the framework of singlet extensions
of the Standard Model (SM), with focus on the CxSM. After demonstrating that
scenarios with large rates for such chain decays are possible we perform a
comparison between the NMSSM and the CxSM. We find that, based on
Higgs-to-Higgs decays, the only possibility to distinguish the two models at
the LHC run 2 is through final states with two different scalars. This
conclusion builds a strong case for searches for final states with two
different scalars at the LHC run 2. Finally, we propose a set of benchmark
points for the real and complex singlet extensions to be tested at the LHC run
2. They have been chosen such that the discovery prospects of the involved
scalars are maximised and they fulfil the dark matter constraints. Furthermore,
for some of the points the theory is stable up to high energy scales. For the

of this system. In this work, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field

scattering and specific heat measurements on Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. We also
reconsider the possible importance of the nuclear specific heat, $C_{\rm nuc}$,
in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. We find that $C_{\rm nuc}$ is not entirely negligible
below a temperature $\sim 0.5$ K and must be taken into account in a
quantitative analysis of the calorimetric data of this compound below that
temperature. We find that small effective exchange interactions compete with
the magnetostatic dipolar interaction responsible for the main spin ice
phenomenology. This causes an unexpected ""refrustration"" of the long-range
order that would be expected from the incompletely self-screened dipolar
interaction and which positions the material at the boundary between two
competing classical long-range ordered ground states. This allows for the
manifestation of new physical low-temperature phenomena in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$,
as exposed by recent specific heat measurements. We show that among the four
most likely causes for the observed upturn of the specific heat at low

non-Ising (transverse) terms in the effective spin Hamiltonian, the nuclear

at searching for intrinsically luminous unlensed galaxies during the first 700
Myr after the Big Bang. BoRG[z9-10] is the continuation of a multi-year
pure-parallel near-IR and optical imaging campaign with the Wide Field Camera
3. The ongoing survey uses five filters, optimized for detecting the most
distant objects and offering continuous wavelength coverage from
{\lambda}=0.35{\mu}m to {\lambda}=1.7{\mu}m. We analyze the initial ~130
arcmin$^2$ of area over 28 independent lines of sight (~25% of the total
planned) to search for z>7 galaxies using a combination of Lyman break and
photometric redshift selections. From an effective comoving volume of (5-25)
$times 10^5$ Mpc$^3$ for magnitudes brighter than $m_{AB}=26.5-24.0$ in the
$H_{160}$-band respectively, we find five galaxy candidates at z~8.3-10
detected at high confidence (S/N>8), including a source at z~8.4 with mAB=24.5
(S/N~22), which, if confirmed, would be the brightest galaxy identified at such
early times (z>8). In addition, BoRG[z9-10] data yield four galaxies with $7.3
\lesssim z \lesssim 8$. These new Lyman break galaxies with m$\lesssim26.5$ are
ideal targets for follow-up observations from ground and space based
observatories to help investigate the complex interplay between dark matter
growth, galaxy assembly, and reionization.

meet the relic abundance constraint as well as bounds from structure formation

vanish exactly, the DW mechanism will unavoidably affect the sterile neutrino
DM population created by any other production mechanism. We present a
semi-analytic approach to the DW mechanism acting on an arbitrary initial
abundance of sterile neutrinos, allowing to combine DW with any other preceding
production mechanism in a physical and precise way. While previous analyses
usually assumed that the spectra produced by DW and another mechanism can
simply be added, we use our semi-analytic results to discuss the validity of
this assumption and to quantify its accurateness, thereby also scrutinising the
DW spectrum and the derived mass bounds. We then map our results to the case of
sterile neutrino DM from the decay of a real SM singlet coupled to the Higgs.

simple free-streaming estimates in order to judge on the effects of the DW

constant interest rate r is replaced by a stochastic time dependent rate r(t)

non-alignment, was developed in [1]. The white noise amplitude f(t), called
arbitrage bubble, generates a time dependent potential U(t) which changes the
usual equilibrium dynamics of the traditional Black-Scholes model. The purpose
of this article is to tackle the inverse problem, that is, is it possible to
extract the time dependent potential U(t) and its associated bubble shape f(t)
from the real empirical financial data? In order to give an answer to this
question, the interacting Black-Scholes equation must be interpreted as a
quantum Schrodinger equation with hamiltonian operator H=H0+U(t), where H0 is
the equilibrium Black-Scholes hamiltonian and U(t) is the interaction term. If
the U(t) term is small enough, the interaction potential can be thought as a
perturbation, so one can compute the solution of the interacting Black-Scholes
equation in an approximate form by perturbation theory. In [2] by applying the
semi-classical considerations, an approximate solution of the non equilibrium
Black-Scholes equation for an arbitrary bubble shape f(t) was developed. Using
this semi-classical solution and the knowledge about the mispricing of the
financial data, one can determinate an equation, which solutions permit obtain
the functional form of the potential term U(t) and its associated bubble f(t).
In all the studied cases, the non equilibrium model performs a better
estimation of the real data than the usual equilibrium model. It is expected
that this new and simple methodology for calibrating and simulating option
pricing solutions in the presence of market imperfections, could help to
improve option pricing estimations.

imaging is one of the tasks of the new generation of high-contrast imagers. For
this purpose, the VLT/SPHERE instrument includes a unique long-slit
spectroscopy (LSS) mode coupled with Lyot coronagraphy in its infrared
dual-band imager and spectrograph (IRDIS). The performance of this mode is
intrinsically limited by the use of a non-optimal coronagraph, but in a
previous work we demonstrated that it could be significantly improved at small
inner-working angles using the stop-less Lyot coronagraph (SLLC). We now
present the development, testing, and validation of the first SLLC prototype
for VLT/SPHERE. Based on the transmission profile previously proposed, the
prototype was manufactured using microdots technology and was installed inside
the instrument in 2014. The transmission measurements agree well with the
specifications, except in the very low transmissions (<5% in amplitude). The
performance of the SLLC is tested in both imaging and spectroscopy using data
acquired on the internal source. In imaging, we obtain a raw contrast gain of a
factor 10 at 0.3"" and 5 at 0.5"" with the SLLC. Using data acquired with a
focal-plane mask, we also demonstrate that no Lyot stop is required to reach
the full performance, which validates the SLLC concept. Comparison with a
realistic simulation model shows that we are currently limited by the internal
phase aberrations of SPHERE. In spectroscopy, we obtain a gain of ~1 mag in a
limited range of angular separations. Simulations show that although the main
limitation comes from phase errors, the performance in the non-SLLC case is
very close to the ultimate limit of the LSS mode. Finally, we obtain the very
first on-sky data with the SLLC, which appear extremely promising for the
future scientific exploitation of an apodized LSS mode in SPHERE.

numerical calculations suggest that such a kagome spin liquid is insensitive to
the XXZ anisotropy and is adjacent to a chiral spin liquid phase. Reformulating
the problem in terms of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical bosonic
spinons, we propose that the kagome spin liquid can be understood as a
deconfined critical phase extended by the $U(1)$ gauge fluctuation from a
deconfined critical point between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a
superfluid phase. Crucially, the stability of this QSL is ensured by the gauge
fluctuation and hence our description necessarily falls beyond the conventional
mean-field constructions of QSLs. Our work also makes an interesting connection
between the critical spin liquid, deconfined criticality, symmetry protected
topological phase and topological order.

statistical analysis of galaxy clustering data. Independent realisations of
observational measurements can be used to sample the covariance, nevertheless
statistical sampling errors will propagate into the cosmological parameter
inference potentially limiting the capabilities of the upcoming generation of
galaxy surveys. The impact of these errors as function of the number of
independent realisations has been previously evaluated for Gaussian distributed
data. However, non-linearities in the late time clustering of matter cause
departures from Gaussian statistics. Here, we address the impact of
non-Gaussian errors on the sample covariance and precision matrix errors using
a large ensemble of numerical N-body simulations. In the range of modes where
finite volume effects are negligible ($0.1\lesssim k\,[h\,{\rm
Mpc^{-1}}]\lesssim 1.2$) we find deviations of the estimated variance of the
sample covariance with respect to Gaussian predictions above $\sim 10\%$ level.
These reduce to about $\sim 5\%$ in the case of the precision matrix. Finally,
we perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the effect of covariance errors on the
cosmological parameter constraints. In particular, assuming Euclid-like survey
characteristics we find that a number of independent realisation larger than
$\gtrsim 5000$ is necessary to reduce the contribution of sample covariance
errors to the cosmological parameter uncertainties at sub-percent level. We
also show that restricting the analysis to large scales $k\lesssim0.2\,h\,{\rm
Mpc^{-1}}$ results in a considerable loss in constraining power, while using
the linear covariance to include smaller scales leads to an underestimation of
the errors on the cosmological parameters.

imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount
of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some
individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law
over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the
plane of infrared excess (IRX, $L_{\text{TIR}}/L_{\text{UV}}$) and UV slope
($\beta$). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model,
$A_{\lambda,\delta}=E(B-V)\ k_\lambda\ (\lambda/\lambda_V)^\delta$ where
$k_\lambda$ is the dust law of Calzetti et al. (2000), and show that there
exists a correlation between the color excess ${E(B-V)}$ and tilt $\delta$ with
${\delta=(0.62\pm0.05)\log(E(B-V))}$+ ${(0.26~\pm~0.02)}$. Galaxies with high
color excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color
excess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample
show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass,
star-formation rate, or $\beta$. The change in the dust law with color excess
is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by by scattering, a
mixed star-dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age,
metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows
potential to constrain the dust law at even higher ($z>3$) redshifts.

these four different models, our numerical data suggests that all of the
$k$-core models, even for $k=3$, exhibit behavior similar to ordinary

We also provide a proof, for some hyperbolic lattices, of the existence of a

we introduce two types of graphs and find that (1) the proposed recovery
strategy achieves the optimal rates; and (2) the experimentally designed
sampling fundamentally outperforms uniform sampling for Type-2 class of graphs.
To validate our proposed recovery strategy, we test it on five specific graphs:

rapidly growing sequence databases is one of the most formidable tasks in
systems biology today. We propose here a novel approach based on the
Direct-Coupling Analysis of the co-evolution between inter-protein residue

partners at a true-positive rate of 70% resp. 90% within the first 10
predictions, with areas of 0.69 resp. 0.81 under the ROC curves for all

to the only two interactions experimentally known. On the level of residue
interactions we show that for both the small and the large ribosomal subunit
our approach predicts interacting residues in the system with a true positive
rate of 60% and 85% in the first 20 predictions. We use artificial data to show
that the performance of our approach depends crucially on the size of the joint
multiple sequence alignments and analyze how many sequences would be necessary

we use for prediction. Given the performance of our approach on the test data

turbulence in the pulsar's electromagnetic outflow. Turbulence is triggered
upstream by dynamical instability of the wind's oscillating magnetic field, and
accelerates non-thermal particles. On impacting the wind termination shock,
those particles emit a distinct synchrotron component $F_{\nu,\rm flare}$,
which is constantly modulated by intermittency of the upstream plasma flow.
Flares are observed when the high-energy cutoff of $F_{\nu,\rm flare}$ emerges
above the fast-declining nebular emission around 0.1 - 1 GeV. Simulations
carried out in the force-free electrodynamics approximation predict the striped
wind to become fully turbulent well ahead of the wind termination shock,

characterization of the class of decision tasks that can be solved in a
wait-free manner by asynchronous processes that communicate by writing and
taking atomic snapshots of a shared memory. Several variations of the model
have been proposed (immediate snapshots and iterated immediate snapshots), all
equivalent for wait-free solution of decision tasks, in spite of the fact that
the protocol complexes that arise from the different models are structurally
distinct. The topological and combinatorial properties of these snapshot
protocol complexes have been studied in detail, providing explanations for why
the asynchronous computability theorem holds in all the models.
  In reality concurrent systems do not provide processes with snapshot
operations. Instead, snapshots are implemented (by a wait-free protocol) using
operations that write and read individual shared memory locations. Thus,
read/write protocols are also computationally equivalent to snapshot protocols.
However, the structure of the read/write protocol complex has not been studied.
In this paper we show that the read/write iterated protocol complex is
collapsible (and hence contractible). Furthermore, we show that a distributed
protocol that wait-free implements atomic snapshots in effect is performing the

beyond-CMOS logic technology has remained elusive. Here, we propose a scalable
spintronic logic device which operates via spin-orbit transduction combined
with magneto-electric switching. The proposed Magneto-Electric Spin Orbit
(MESO) logic enables a new paradigm to continue scaling of logic performance to
near thermodynamic limits for GHz logic (100 kT switching energy at 100 ps
delay). The proposed MESO devices scale strongly and favorably with critical
dimensions of the device, showing a cubic dependence of switching energy on
size, (E_m proportional to W^3), and square dependence on voltage (E_m
proportional to V^2). The excellent scaling is obtained thanks to the
properties of the spin orbit effects (e.g. Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE) and
Inverse Rashba-Edelstein Effect (IREE)) and the dependence of capacitance on
size. The operating voltages for these devices are predicted to be < 100 mV
allowing a significant jump ahead of historic trends of scaling voltage with
size and corresponding reduction of energy. Interconnect resistance is a
critical obstacle for scaling beyond 10 nm dimensions. We project a less
detrimental impact of interconnect resistance and show that MESO logic is
amenable for highly resistive interconnects (100 uOhm.cm-1 mOhm.cm) which opens
a possibility to use nano-metallic (width < bulk electron mean free path) or
doped semiconducting wires (width<5 nm). A scalable, CMOS compatible,
non-volatile logic family proposed here may enable the next multi-generational
scaling of computing devices.

which has been widely and successfully used in various areas. In this paper, an
event-triggered impulsive control scheme (ETI) is introduced to improve the
performance of DE. Impulsive control, the concept of which derives from control
theory, aims at regulating the states of a network by instantly adjusting the
states of a fraction of nodes at certain instants, and these instants are
determined by event-triggered mechanism (ETM). By introducing impulsive control
and ETM into DE, we hope to change the search performance of the population in
a positive way after revising the positions of some individuals at certain
moments. At the end of each generation, the impulsive control operation is
triggered when the update rate of the population declines or equals to zero. In
detail, inspired by the concepts of impulsive control, two types of impulses
are presented within the framework of DE in this paper: stabilizing impulses
and destabilizing impulses. Stabilizing impulses help the individuals with
lower rankings instantly move to a desired state determined by the individuals
with better fitness values. Destabilizing impulses randomly alter the positions
of inferior individuals within the range of the current population. By means of
intelligently modifying the positions of a part of individuals with these two
kinds of impulses, both exploitation and exploration abilities of the whole
population can be meliorated. In addition, the proposed ETI is flexible to be
incorporated into several state-of-the-art DE variants. Experimental results
over the CEC 2014 benchmark functions exhibit that the developed scheme is

play a key role in experimental gravity, as they allow us to compute
observables in extreme spacetimes that deviate from the predictions of general
relativity. Such solutions are often difficult to find in
beyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields
that couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we
consider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the
introduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the
Pontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective
field theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as
small perturbations from general relativity. We perturb about the
maximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop
mathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions
for generic spin. First we find closed-form, analytic expressions for the
extremal scalar field, and then determine the trace of the metric perturbation,
giving both in terms of Legendre decompositions. Retaining only the first three
and four modes in the Legendre representation of the scalar field and the
trace, respectively, suffices to ensure a fidelity of over 99% relative to full
numerical solutions. The leading-order mode in the Legendre expansion of the
trace of the metric perturbation contains a logarithmic divergence at the
extremal Kerr horizon, which is likely to be unimportant as it occurs inside
the perturbed dynamical Chern-Simons horizon. The techniques employed here
should enable the construction of analytic, closed-form expressions for the
scalar field and metric perturbations on a background with arbitrary rotation.

with the help of simulation codes, the wakefields induced beam energy loss in
the sophisticated undulator section is calculated for Shanghai soft X-ray FEL,
which is a two-stage seeded FEL test facility. While the 1st stage 44 nm FEL
output is almost not affected by the wakefields, it is found that a beam energy
loss about 0.8 MeV degrades the peak brightness of the 2nd stage 8.8 nm FEL by
a factor of 1.6, which however can be compensated by a magnetic field fine
tuning of each undulator segment.

vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of
cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory is
recently proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the
cortex. In this paper, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply
it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show
the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable-order
temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse
temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal
sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient
disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence
learning algorithms, including statistical methods: autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural networks: online sequential extreme
learning machine (ELM), and recurrent neural networks: long short-term memory
(LSTM) and echo-state networks (ESN), on sequence prediction problems with both
artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to
other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are
critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the
ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high order
statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good
performance without task-specific hyper- parameters tuning. Therefore the HTM
sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve
the sequence learning problem, but is also applicable to a wide range of
real-world problems such as discrete and continuous sequence prediction,
anomaly detection, and sequence classification.

single-field description defines the particle motion and their interaction with
the electromagnetic field at small-scale, the system-scale, and intermediate

more informative than simple features expressing the presence or the absence of

to obtain a balance between total correlation and the complexity of the

naturally in studying the fluctuations on the probe. In Gauge-String duality,
it is known that in the presence of a constant electric field on the
worldvolume of the probe, the open string metric acquires an event horizon and
therefore the fluctuation modes on the probe experience an effective
temperature. In this article, we bring together various properties of such a
system to a formal definition and a subsequent narration of the effective
thermodynamics and the stress tensor of the corresponding flavour fields, also
including a non-vanishing chemical potential. In doing so, we point out a
potentially infinitely-degenerate scheme-dependence of regularizing the free
energy, which nevertheless yields a universal contribution in certain cases.
This universal piece appears as the coefficient of a log-divergence in free
energy when a space-filling probe brane is embedded in AdS$_{d+1}$-background,
for $d=2, 4$, and is related to conformal anomaly. For the special case of
$d=2$, the universal factor has a striking resemblance to the well-known heat
current formula in $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory in steady-state,
which endows a plausible physical interpretation to it. Interestingly, we
observe a vanishing conformal anomaly in $d=6$.

not only requires state elimination, and that the proof given by Han and Wood

via control fields that couple to the quantum system and are chosen to best
mitigate errors resulting from time-dependent noise. We allow for two sources
of noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the
environment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation
rooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical
statistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms
of a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective,
noise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error
mitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the
sought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error
mitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e.,
those that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the
control fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in
terms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the
`forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with
respect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation
of constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that
they feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by
considering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$
arbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal
error-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is
valid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e.,
$s \to \infty$) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework
for addressing quantum control in the presence of noise for systems of
arbitrary complexity.

spontaneous activity and induced response. A finite fraction of the eigenvalues
condense onto the real or imaginary axes. For large N, the spectrum has
remarkable symmetries not only with respect to reflections across the real and

anisotropic divergence in the localization length near the origin. When chains
with periodic boundary conditions become directed, with a systematic
directional bias superimposed on the randomness, a hole centered on the origin
opens up in the density-of-states in the complex plane. All states are extended

unchanged. The bias dependent shape of this hole tracks the bias independent
contours of constant localization length. We treat the large-N limit by a
combination of direct numerical diagonalization and using transfer matrices, an

this paper, we contribute in the area of classical cryptography by providing a
modified approach and expanded version for Caesar cipher using knowledge of
mathematics and computer science. To increase the strength of this classical
encryption technique we use the concepts of affine ciphers, transposition
ciphers and randomized substitution techniques to create a cipher text which is
nearly impossible to decode. We also increase the domain of characters which
Caesar cipher Algorithm can encrypt by including all ASCII and extended ASCII
characters in addition to alphabets. A complex key generation technique which
generates two keys from a single key is used to provide enhanced security. We

the environment to capture images that are more suited for training and that
lead to better performance at test time. In this paper, we propose a deep
convolutional neural network for active object recognition that simultaneously
predicts the object label, and selects the next action to perform on the object
with the aim of improving recognition performance. We treat active object
recognition as a reinforcement learning problem and derive the cost function to
train the network for joint prediction of the object label and the action. A
generative model of object similarities based on the Dirichlet distribution is
proposed and embedded in the network for encoding the state of the system. The
training is carried out by simultaneously minimizing the label and action
prediction errors using gradient descent. We empirically show that the proposed
network is able to predict both the object label and the actions on GERMS, a
dataset for active object recognition. We compare the test label prediction
accuracy of the proposed model with Dirichlet and Naive Bayes state encoding.
The results of experiments suggest that the proposed model equipped with
Dirichlet state encoding is superior in performance, and selects images that
lead to better training and higher accuracy of label prediction at test time.

of the following types of lines: forbidden and permitted pure emissions,
absorption and emission components of lines of ions, pure absorptions (e.g.,
HeI, SiII), and interstellar components of the NaI D-lines, KI, and DIBs. The
heliocentric radial velocity measured for pure absorptions as well as for the
forbidden and permitted pure emissions is close to the systemic radial velocity
and equal to Vr=63.7$\pm$0.3, 65.2$\pm$0.3, and 62.0$\pm$0.4 km/s,
respectively. Positions of the absorption components of the lines with inverse
P Cyg profiles are stable and indicate the presence of clumps moving toward the

is Vr(DIB)=4.6$\pm$0.2 km/s. Comparison of the absorption lines observed in

that the hypergiant reached a phase of slowing down (or termination) of the

component parallel or antiparallel to the amide C-N bond, an effect we refer to
here as EVPR-CN. EVPR-CN is linear and without threshold in the biologically
plausible electrostatic field range -0.005 to 0.005 au. Variation of amide
resonance varies Resonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding such as occurs in the
hydrogen bonded chains of backbone amides of protein secondary structures such
as beta sheets and alpha helices, varying the stability of these structures.
The electrostatic properties including permittivity of amino acid residue
sidegroups influence the electrostatic field component parallel or antiparallel
to the C-N bond of each amide, giving a novel relationship between residue
sequence and protein structure. Additionally, a backbone-based theory of
protein folding which includes this effect is presented in Section 8.4.
  The significance of EVPR-CN relative to other factors in protein folding
depends on field C-N component at each backbone amide at a given time.
Calculation indicates that backbone amides do not occupy an intrinsically
electrostatically-protected niche. We propose that EVPR-CN warrants
investigation in any study of stable protein structure or protein folding
pathway. EVPR-CN is somewhat associated with hydrophobia, since hydrophobia
creates low permittivity environments. EVPR-CN is more directionally and hence
structurally specific than hydrophobia.
  Hypotheses concerning the stability of beta sheets and amyloid fibrils and of
protein complexation and molecular chaperone function are offered. An analogous
effect in nitrogenous base pairing is proposed.
  EVPR-CN is energetically significant in biologically plausible electrostatic
fields even without considering a hydrogen bonding context, and a hypothesis
concerning the stability of polyproline helices types I and II is offered.

where the agents' utilities for being matched to other agents are hidden and
the mechanism only has access to ordinal preference information. Our model is
motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the
numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to
rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems
where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph, and look to
design algorithms that approximate the true optimum matching using only the
preference orderings for each agent (induced by the hidden weights) as input.
If no restrictions are placed on the weights, then one cannot hope to do better
than the simple greedy algorithm, which yields a half optimal matching. Perhaps
surprisingly, we show that by imposing a little structure on the weights, we
can improve upon the trivial algorithm significantly: we design a
1.6-approximation algorithm for instances where the hidden weights obey the
metric inequality. Using our algorithms for matching as a black-box, we also
design new approximation algorithms for other closely related problems: these
include a a 3.2-approximation for the problem of clustering agents into equal
sized partitions, a 4-approximation algorithm for Densest k-subgraph, and a
2.14-approximation algorithm for Max TSP. These results are the first
non-trivial ordinal approximation algorithms for such problems, and indicate
that we can design robust algorithms even when we are agnostic to the precise
agent utilities.

The stochastic Navier-Stokes equation is used for a generation of the velocity

field-theoretic action is derived using the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism and
path integral approach. The regime of equilibrium fluctuations is analyzed
within perturbative renormal- ization group method. The double $(\epsilon

renormalization procedure is performed to the leading order. The main corollary
gained from the analysis of the thermal equilibrium regime suggests that
one-loop calculations of the presented models are not sufficient to make a
definite conclusion about the stability of fixed points. We also show that

at negative temperature, a phenomenon that Onsager demonstrated to be a
consequence of bounded phase space. In a confined superfluid, quantized
vortices can support such an ordered phase, provided they evolve as an almost
isolated subsystem containing sufficient energy. A detailed theoretical
understanding of the statistical mechanics of such states thus requires a
microcanonical approach. Here we develop an analytical theory of the vortex
clustering transition in a neutral system of quantum vortices confined to a
two-dimensional disk geometry, within the microcanonical ensemble. As the
system energy increases above a critical value, the system develops global
order via the emergence of a macroscopic dipole structure from the homogeneous
phase of vortices, spontaneously breaking the Z2 symmetry associated with
invariance under vortex circulation exchange, and the rotational SO(2) symmetry
due to the disk geometry. The dipole structure emerges characterized by the
continuous growth of the macroscopic dipole moment which serves as a global
order parameter, resembling a continuous phase transition. The critical
temperature of the transition, and the critical exponent associated with the
dipole moment, are obtained exactly within mean-field theory. The clustering
transition is shown to be distinct from the final state reached at high energy,
known as supercondensation. The dipole moment develops via two macroscopic
vortex clusters and the cluster locations are found analytically, both near the
clustering transition and in the supercondensation limit. The microcanonical
theory shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, and signatures
of the transition are apparent even for a modest system of 100 vortices,
accessible in current Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.

H2 molecules quickly form in relatively dense clumps and spread into the
diffuse interclump gas. This in particular leads to the existence of
significant abundances of H2 in the diffuse and warm gas that lies in between
clumps. Simulations and observations show similar trends, specially for the
HI-to-H2 transition. The abundances of excited rotational levels, calculated at
equilibrium in the simulations are very similar to the observed abundances
inferred from FUSE results. This is a direct consequence of the presence of the
H2 enriched diffuse and warm gas. Our simulations show that H2 rapidly forms in
the dense clumps and, due to the complex structure of molecular clouds, quickly
spreads at lower densities. Consequently a significant fraction of warm H2
exists in the low density gas. This warm H2 leads to column densities of
excited rotational levels close to the observed ones likely revealing the
complex intermix between the warm and the cold gas in molecular clouds. This
suggests that the 2-phase structure of molecular clouds is an essential
ingredient to fully understand molecular hydrogen in these objects.

Different bulge geometries and Reynolds numbers - with the highest friction
Reynolds number simulation reaching a peak of Re{\tau} = 900 - are addressed to
understand the effect of the wall curvature and of the Reynolds number on the
dynamics of the recirculating bubble behind the bump. Most of the drag is due
to the form contribution, whilst the friction contribution does not change
appreciably with respect to an equivalent planar channel flow. The most bluff
geometry has a larger recirculation region, whilst the Reynolds number increase
results in a smaller recirculation bubble and a shear layer more attached to
the bump. The energy introduced by the pressure drop follows two routes: part
of it is transferred towards the walls to be dissipated and part feeds the
turbulent production hence the velocity fluctuations in the separating shear
layer. Spatial energy fluxes transfer the kinetic energy into the recirculation
bubble and downstream near the wall where it is ultimately dissipated.
Consistently, anisotropy concentrates at small scales near the walls
irrespective of the value of the Reynolds number. In the bulk flow and in the
recirculation bubble, isotropy is restored at small scales and the isotropy
recovery rate is controlled by the Reynolds number. Anisotropy invariant maps
are presented, showing the difficulty in developing suitable turbulence models
to predict separated turbulent flow dynamics. Results shed light on the
processes of production, transfer and dissipation of energy in this relatively
complex turbulent flow where non-homogeneous effects overwhelm the classical
picture of wall bounded turbulent flows which typically exploits streamwise
homogeneity.

temperature and degeneracy enhancement effective inertia of bulk e-p components
also makes the effective skin depths larger (much larger) than the standard
skin depth. The emergence of these intermediate and macro scales lends immense
richness to the process of structure formation, and vastly increases the
channels for energy transformations. The possible role played by this mechanism
in explaining the existence of large-scale structures in astrophysical objects
with degenerate plasmas, is examined.

an important parameter passed over in previous analysis and experiments. The

couple to the electric or magnetic mode structure of the Haloscope cavity. For
typical Haloscope experiments the electric and magnetic coupling is the same
and implicitly assumed in past sensitivity calculations. However, for future
planned searches such as those at high frequency, which synchronize multiple
cavities, the sensitivity will be altered due to different magnetic and

Although this technique itself is not new, we can obtain a new model, the
so-called ""semi-doubled"" GLSM. Similar to doubled sigma model, this involves
both the original and dual degrees of freedom simultaneously, whilst the latter
only contribute to the system via topological interactions. Applying this to
the ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ GLSM for H-monopoles, i.e., smeared NS5-branes, we obtain
its T-dualized systems in quite an easy way. As a bonus, we also obtain the
semi-doubled GLSM for an exotic $5^3_2$-brane whose background is locally
nongeometric. In the low energy limit, we construct the semi-doubled NLSM which
also generates the conventional string worldsheet sigma models. In the case of
the NLSM for $5^3_2$-brane, however, we find that the Dirac monopole equation
does not make sense any more because the physical information is absorbed into
the divergent part via the smearing procedure. This is nothing but the signal
which indicates that the nongeometric feature emerges in the considering model.

ALMA observations at 820 micron on baselines up to 410 kilolambda are compared

the assumption of a constant dust opacity, a broken radial power law best
describes the dust surface density, with a slope of -0.53 +/- 0.01 from the 4.1
au radius of the (already known) inner hole to a turn-over radius of 47.1 +/-
0.2 au, steepening to -8.0 +/- 0.1 at larger radii. The emission drops below
the detection limit beyond ~60 au. The shape of the dust surface density is
consistent with theoretical expectations for grain growth, fragmentation, and
drift, but its total dust content and its turn-over radius are too large for TW
Hya's age of 8-10 Myr even when taking into account a radially varying dust
opacity. Higher resolution imaging with ALMA of TW Hya and other disks is
required to establish if unseen gaps associated with, e.g., embedded planets
trap grains at large radii or if locally enhanced grain growth associated with
the CO snow line explains the extent of the millimeter-continuum surface
brightness profile. In the latter case, population studies should reveal a
correlation between the location of the CO snow line and the extent of the
millimeter continuum. In the former case, and if CO freeze out promotes planet
formation, this correlation should extend to the location of gaps as well.

this natural definition, some quantum walk algorithms instead use the adjacency
matrix to effect the walk. While this is equivalent to the Laplacian for
regular graphs, it is different for non-regular graphs, and is thus an
inequivalent quantum walk. We algorithmically explore this distinction by
analyzing search on the complete bipartite graph with multiple marked vertices,

  methods",,,"10.1002/qj.2839",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art weather forecasts usually rely on ensemble prediction
systems, accounting for the different sources of uncertainty. As ensembles are
typically uncalibrated, they should get statistically postprocessed. Several
multivariate ensemble postprocessing techniques, which additionally consider
spatial, inter-variable and/or temporal dependencies, have been developed.
These can be roughly divided into two groups. The first group comprises
parametric, mainly low-dimensional approaches that are tailored to specific
settings. The second group involves non-parametric reordering methods that
impose a specific dependence template on univariately postprocesed forecasts
and are suitable in any dimension. In this paper, these different strategies
are combined, with the aim to exploit the benefits of both concepts.
Specifically, a high-dimensional postprocessing problem is divided into
multiple low-dimensional instances, each of which is postprocessed via a
suitable multivariate parametric method. From each postprocessed
low-dimensional distribution, a sample is drawn, which is then reordered
according to the corresponding multidimensional rank structure of an
appropriately chosen dependence template. In this context, different ranking
concepts for multivariate settings are discussed. Finally, all reordered
samples are aggregated to obtain the overall postprocessed ensemble. The new
approach is applied to ensemble forecasts for temperature and wind speed at
several locations from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts,
using a recent bivariate ensemble model output statistics postprocessing
technique and a reordering based on the raw ensemble forecasts similar to the
ensemble copula coupling method. It shows good predictive skill and outperforms
reference ensembles.

parity-density matrix renormalization group with periodic boundary conditions.
The finite-size scaling of R\'enyi entropies $S_2$ and $S_\infty$ are used to
construct the phase diagram of the system. The phase diagram displays three
possible phases: Haldane type (an example of symmetry protected topological
ordered phases), Classical Dimer and N\'eel phases, the latter bounded by two
continuous quantum phase transitions. The entanglement and non-locality in the
ground state are studied and quantified by the entanglement convertibility. We
found that, at small spatial scales, the ground state is not convertible within
the topological Haldane dimer phase. The phenomenology we observe can be
described in terms of correlations between edge states. We found that the
entanglement spectrum also exhibits a distinctive response in the topological
phase: the effective rank of the reduced density matrix displays a specifically
large ""susceptibility"" in the topological phase. These findings support the
idea that although the topological order in the ground state cannot be detected
by local inspection, the ground state response at local scale can tell the
topological phases apart from the non-topological phases.

Distinguishing functional from non-functional binding is therefore a major
challenge in the study of transcriptional regulation. We hypothesized that
functional targets can be discovered by correlating binding and expression
profiles across multiple experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we
obtained ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from matching cell types from the human
ENCODE resource, considered promoter-proximal and distal cumulative regulatory
models to map binding sites to genes, and used a combination of linear and
non-linear measures to correlate binding and expression data. We found that a
high degree of correlation between a gene's TF-binding and expression profiles
was significantly more predictive of the gene being differentially expressed
upon knockdown of that TF, compared to using binding sites in the cell type of
interest only. Remarkably, TF targets predicted from correlation across a
compendium of cell types were also predictive of functional targets in other
cell types. Finally, correlation across a time course of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq
experiments was also predictive of functional TF targets in that tissue.

exponential with the inverse rate given by the sum of the adiabatic curve
crossing (Kramers) time and inverse MLD rate. However, near to adiabatic

singal from the associate production of a singlet scalar and a photon, as well
as some signals from the partner cascade decays. These signals may jointly
allow for a test of this framework in future LHC and ILC experiments.

  Measurements Using Simultaneous Direction Method of Multipliers",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High resolution ultrasound image reconstruction from a reduced number of
measurements is of great interest in ultrasound imaging, since it could enhance
both the frame rate and image resolution. Compressive deconvolution, combining
compressed sensing and image deconvolution, represents an interesting
possibility to consider this challenging task. The model of compressive
deconvolution includes, in addition to the compressive sampling matrix, a 2D
convolution operator carrying the information on the system point spread
function. Through this model, the resolution of reconstructed ultrasound images
from compressed measurements mainly depends on three aspects: the acquisition
setup, i.e. the incoherence of the sampling matrix, the image regularization,
i.e. the sparsity prior, and the optimization technique. In this paper, we
mainly focused on the last two aspects. We proposed a novel simultaneous
direction method of multipliers-based optimization scheme to invert the linear
model, including two regularization terms expressing the sparsity of the RF
images in a given basis and the generalized Gaussian statistical assumption on
tissue reflectivity functions. The performance of the method is evaluated on
both simulated and in vivo data.

brighter BL Lacs. We find that the ratios between the X-ray and radio
luminosities range from ~20 to ~30000 and that the synchrotron peak frequencies
span a wide energy interval, from log(nu_peak)~13.5 to ~20 [Hz]. This indicates
a broad variety of SED shapes and a mixture of BL Lac flavors. Indeed, although
the majority of our LPBLs are high-energy peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), we find that a
quarter of them are low-energy peaked BL Lacs (LBLs), despite the fact that the
sample is biased against the selection of LBLs. The analysis of the median LPBL
SED confirms disagreement with the blazar sequence at low radio luminosities.
Furthermore, if we limit the sample to the LBLs subsample, we find that their
median SED shape is essentially indistinguishable from that of the most
luminous BL Lacs. We conclude that the observed radio power is not the main

moments. For faint galaxies, observational noise can make the denominator close
to zero, so the ratios become ill-defined. Knowledge of these ratios (i.e.
their measured standard deviation) is commonly used to assess the efficiency of
weak gravitational lensing surveys. Since the requirements cannot be formally
tested for faint galaxies, we explore two complementary mitigation strategies.
In many weak lensing contexts, the most problematic sources can be removed by a
cut in measured size. We investigate how a size cuts affects the required
precision of the charge transfer inefficiency model and find slightly wider
tolerance margins compared to the full size distribution. However, subtle
biases in the data analysis chain may be introduced. Instead, as our second
strategy, we propose requirements directly on the quadrupole moments
themselves. To optimally exploit a Stage-IV dark energy survey, we find that
the mean and standard deviation of a population of galaxies' quadrupole moments
must to be known to better than $1.4\times10^{-3}$ arcsec$^{2}$, or the Stokes
parameters to $1.9\times10^{-3}$ arcsec$^2$. This testable requirement can now
form the basis for future performance validation, or for proportioning the
requirements between subsystems to ensure unbiased cosmological parameter
inference.

energetics of AGN feedback by mapping the kinematics of the ionized gas on kpc
scale. We study how the observed kinematics and inferred energetics are
affected by beam smearing of a bright unresolved NLR due to seeing. We analyse
IFU spectroscopy of a sample of twelve QSOs initially presented by Liu et al.
(2014). The PSF for the observations is directly obtained from the light
distribution of the broad Hb line component. We are able to compare the ionized
gas kinematics and derived energetics of the total, spatially extended, and
unresolved [OIII] emission. We find that the spatially resolved [OIII] line
width on kpc scales is significantly narrower than the one before PSF
deblending. The ENLRs appear offset from the QSO position or more elongated
which can be interpreted in favour of a conical outflow on large scales while a
spherical geometry cannot be excluded for the unresolved NLR. We find that the
kinetic power at 5kpc distance from the spherical model by Liu et al. (2013) is
reduced by two magnitudes for a conical outflow and one magnitude for the
unresolved NLR after PSF deblending. This reduced kinetic power corresponds to
0.01-0.1% of the bolometric AGN luminosity. This is smaller than the 5-10%
feedback efficiency required by some simulations to reproduce the massive
galaxy population. The injected momentum fluxes are close or below the simple
radiation-pressure limit Lbol/c for the conical outflow model for the NLR and
ENLR when beam smearing is considered. IFU spectroscopy is a powerful tool to
investigate the energetics of AGN outflows, but the impact of beam smearing has
to be taken into account. For the majority of observations in the literature,
this has not been addressed carefully so that the incidence and energetics of
presumed kpc-scale AGN-driven outflows still remain an unsolved issue.

deterministic case, we seek tight bounds that apply to particular local
attractors. An obstacle to proving such bounds is that they do not hold
globally; they are generally violated by trajectories starting outside the

obstacle: one that requires knowing a subset of the basin of attraction, and
another that considers the zero-noise limit of the corresponding stochastic
system. The bounding methods are illustrated using the van der Pol oscillator.
We bound deterministic averages on the attracting limit cycle above and below

fixed point at the origin. We obtain similarly tight upper and lower bounds on
stochastic expectations for a range of noise amplitudes. Limitations of our

mechanical environment. Many experiments have investigated and observed such
structural adaptation. However, there is still much uncertainty about how to
define the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and
stable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state
varies both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose
an osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of
structural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in
bone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current
local mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic
osteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two
main types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify
the reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during
bone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The
other is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and
reversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to
propose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties
provide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is
gradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating
long-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term
mechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model. The
consideration of osteocyte desensitisation and of osteocyte replacement by
remodelling is able to capture the different phenomena and timescales observed
during the mechanical adaptation of bone tissues, lending support to this
theory.

mainly focus on a particular model that matter is minimally coupled to the
geometry in the metric formalism and wherein, its coupling energy--momentum
tensor is also conserved. We obtain the corresponding Raychaudhuri dynamical
equation that presents the evolution of the kinematic quantities. Then for the
chosen model, we derive the behavior of the deceleration parameter, and show
that the coupling term can lead to an acceleration phase after the matter
dominated phase. On the other hand, the curvature of the universe corresponds
with the deviation from parallelism in the geodesic motion. Thus, we also
scrutinize the motion of the free test particles on their geodesics, and derive
the geodesic deviation equation in this modified theory to study the
accelerating universe within the spatially flat FLRW background. Actually, this
equation gives the relative accelerations of adjacent particles as a measurable
physical quantity, and provides an elegant tool to investigate the timelike and

period 1988-2014. We apply the mathematical techniques developed for analyzing
optical observations to the analysis of JBE. We break the whole period into a
series of episodes and express the phase of the pulsar in each episode as the
sum of two analytical functions. The first function is the best-fitting local
braking index law, and the second function represents small residuals from this
law with an amplitude of only a few turns, which rapidly relaxes to the local
braking index law. From our analysis, we demonstrate that the power law index
undergoes ""instantaneous"" changes at the time of observed jumps in rotational
frequency (glitches). We find that the phase evolution of the Crab pulsar is
dominated by a series of constant braking law episodes, with the braking index
changing abruptly after each episode in the range of values between 2.1 and
2.6. Deviations from such a regular phase description behave as oscillations
triggered by glitches and amount to fewer than 40 turns during the above
period, in which the pulsar has made more than 2.0e10 turns. Our analysis does
not favor the explanation that glitches are connected to phenomena occurring in
the interior of the pulsar. On the contrary, timing irregularities and changes
in slow down rate seem to point to electromagnetic interaction of the pulsar
with the surrounding environment.

investigate in detail the role played by the depth of the electroweak minimum
(""vacuum energy difference""). We find a strong correlation between the vacuum
energy difference and the strength of the phase transition. This correlation
only breaks down if a negative eigenvalue develops upon thermal corrections in
the squared scalar mass matrix in the broken vacuum before the critical
temperature. As a result the scalar fields slide across field space toward the
symmetric vacuum, often causing a significantly weakened phase transition.
Phenomenological constraints are found to strongly disfavour such sliding
scalar scenarios. For several popular models, we suggest numerical bounds that
guarantee a strong first order electroweak phase transition. The zero
temperature phenomenology can then be studied in these parameter regions
without the need for any finite temperature calculations. For almost all
non-supersymmetric models with phenomenologically viable parameter points, we
find a strong phase transition is guaranteed if the vacuum energy difference is
greater than $-8.8\times 10^7$~\text{GeV}$^4$. For the GNMSSM, we guarantee a
strong phase transition for phenomenologically viable parameter points if the
vacuum energy difference is greater than $-6.9\times 10^7$~\text{GeV}$^4$.
Alternatively, we capture more of the parameter space exhibiting a strong phase
transition if we impose a simultaneous bound on the vacuum energy difference
and the singlet mass.

used to model many real processes such as the epidemic contagion and
information propagation. One of the most significant research questions in
spreading is to rank the spreading ability of nodes in the network. To this
end, substantial effort has been made and a variety of effective methods have
been proposed. These methods usually define the spreading ability of a node as
the number of finally infected nodes given that the spreading is initialized
from the node. However, in many real cases such as advertising and medicine
science the spreading only aims to cover a specific group of nodes. Therefore,
it is necessary to study the spreading ability of nodes towards localized
targets in complex networks. In this paper, we propose a reversed local path
algorithm for this problem. Simulation results show that our method outperforms
the existing methods in identifying the influential nodes with respect to these
localized targets. Moreover, the influential spreaders identified by our method
can effectively avoid infecting the non-target nodes in the spreading process.

existing schemes, we do not consider the Euler--Lagrange equations for the
minimizer. Instead, we use series expansions to formulate a finite dimensional
semidefinite program (SDP) whose solution converges to that of the original
variational problem. Our formulation accounts for the influence of all modes in
the expansion, and the feasible set of the SDP corresponds to a subset of the
feasible set of the original problem. Moreover, SDPs can be easily formulated
when the fluid is subject to imposed boundary fluxes, which pose a challenge
for the traditional methods. We apply this technique to compute rigorous and
near-optimal upper bounds on the dissipation coefficient for flows driven by a
surface stress. We improve previous analytical bounds by more than 10 times,
and show that the bounds become independent of the domain aspect ratio in the
limit of vanishing viscosity. We also confirm that the dissipation properties
of stress driven flows are similar to those of flows subject to a body force
localized in a narrow layer near the surface. Finally, we show that SDP
relaxations are an efficient method to investigate the energy stability of
laminar flows driven by a surface stress.

presented by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations could have originated from a
radion in the bulk Higgs scenario within a warped extra dimension. In this
scenario the couplings of the radion to massive gauge bosons are suppressed,
allowing it to evade existing searches. In the presence of mixing with the
Higgs, due to the strong constraints from diboson searches, only points near
what we denominate the alignment region were able to explain the diphoton
signal and evade other experimental constraints. In light of the new
measurements presented at ICHEP 2016 by both LHC collaborations, which do not
confirm the initial diphoton excess, we study the current and future collider
constraints on a radion within the bulk-Higgs scenario. We find that searches
in the diphoton channel provide the most powerful probe of this scenario and
already exclude large regions of parameter space, particularly for smaller warp
factors. The radion has a sizeable branching ratio into top pairs and this
channel may also give competitive constraints in the future. Finally, diHiggs
searches can provide a complementary probe in the case of non-zero radion-Higgs
mixing but strong alignment.

statics and field-driven dynamics in quasi one-dimensional biaxial nanowires
under arbitrary uniform transverse magnetic fields (TMFs) based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Without axial driving fields, the static TDW
should be symmetric about its center meanwhile twisted in its azimuthal angle
distribution. By decoupling of polar and azimuthal degrees of freedom, an
approximate solution is provided which reproduces these features to a great
extent. When an axial driving field is applied, the dynamical behavior of a TDW
is viewed as the response of its static profile to external excitations. By
means of the asymptotic expansion method, the TDW velocity in traveling-wave
mode is obtained, which provides the extent and boundary of the
""velocity-enhancement"" effect of TMFs to TDWs in biaxial nanowires. Finally
numerical simulations are performed and strongly support our analytics.

  Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model lead to the possibility of
gauge/BEH unification by providing spin-0 bosons as extra states for spin-1
gauge bosons within massive gauge multiplets. Depending on its properties the
125 GeV boson observed at CERN may then also be interpreted, up to a mixing

algorithm modelling the spread of genetic mutations in populations. The
algorithm runs on an underlying graph where individuals correspond to vertices.
Initially, one vertex (chosen u.a.r.) possesses a mutation, with fitness r>1.
All other individuals have fitness 1. During each step of the algorithm, an
individual is chosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its
state (mutant or non-mutant) is passed on to an out-neighbour which is chosen
u.a.r. If the underlying graph is strongly connected then the algorithm will
eventually reach fixation, in which all individuals are mutants, or extinction,
in which no individuals are mutants. An infinite family of directed graphs is
said to be strongly amplifying if, for every r>1, the extinction probability
tends to 0 as the number of vertices increases. Lieberman et al. proposed two
potentially strongly-amplifying families - superstars and metafunnels.
Heuristic arguments have been published, arguing that there are infinite
families of superstars that are strongly amplifying. The same has been claimed
for metafunnels. In this paper, we give the first rigorous proof that there is
an infinite family of directed graphs that is strongly amplifying. We call the
graphs in the family ""megastars"". When the algorithm is run on an n-vertex
graph in this family, starting with a uniformly-chosen mutant, the extinction
probability is roughly $n^{-1/2}$ (up to logarithmic factors). We prove that
all infinite families of superstars and metafunnels have larger extinction
probabilities (as a function of n). Finally, we prove that our analysis of
megastars is fairly tight - there is no infinite family of megastars such that
the Moran algorithm gives a smaller extinction probability (up to logarithmic
factors).

  Since the earliest work on ABC, it has been recognised that using summary
statistics is essential to produce useful inference results. This is because
ABC suffers from a curse of dimensionality effect, whereby using high
dimensional inputs causes large approximation errors in the output. It is
therefore crucial to find low dimensional summaries which are informative about
the parameter inference or model choice task at hand. This chapter reviews the
methods which have been proposed to select such summaries, extending the
previous review paper of Blum et al. (2013) with recent developments. Related

stiffness matrix of the leading term is diagonal and the resulting linear
system is well conditioned. Further, in the Riemann-Liouville case, an enriched

interactive linear models are heterogeneous as they can vary dramatically with
the underlying observed or unobserved covariates. Despite the apparent
importance of heterogeneity, a common practice in modern empirical work is to
largely ignore it by reporting average partial effects (or, at best, average
effects for some groups). While average effects provide very convenient scalar
summaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire
variety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much
more fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects -- a collection of
estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by
percentiles. By construction the sorted effect curves completely represent and
help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot. They are as
convenient and easy to report in practice as the conventional average partial
effects. They also serve as a basis for classification analysis, where we
divide the observational units into most or least affected groups and summarize
their characteristics. We provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard
errors and confidence bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related
classification analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least
affected groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new
mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate sorting
operator and a related classification operator, which are of independent
interest. We apply the sorted effects method and classification analysis to
demonstrate several striking patterns in the gender wage gap.

recent results about information processing in the human brain can help
overcome some traditional difficulties with the interpretation of quantum

the concept of interaction between material bodies as a primary concept. Two
distinct categories can be identified: 1) Interactions which can always be
reduced to a superposition of physical interactions (forces) between elementary
constituents; 2) Interactions between complex bodies which cannot be reduced to
a superposition of interactions between parts, and in which patterns and forms
(in space and/or time) play the determining role. Pragmatic information is then
defined as the correspondence between a given pattern and the ensuing
pattern-specific change. I will show that pragmatic information is a biological
concept that plays no active role in the purely physical domain; it only does
so when a living organism intervenes. The consequences for the foundations of
both classical and quantum physics are important and will be discussed in
detail. Since by its very definition pragmatic information (the one our brain
uses to represent, think about and react to the outside world)cannot operate in
the quantum domain, it is advisable to refrain from using it in our mental
representation of what is happening 'inside' a quantum system. Although the

characteristic curve has an inflection point, also known as an S-shaped
anomaly. Our formulation avoids the risk of numerical overflow in the
calculation. It is suitable for implementation in Fortran, C or on
micro-controllers.

  development and political competition",,,,,"q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a kinetic model with stochastic game-type
interactions, analyzing the relationship between the level of political
competition in a society and the degree of economic liberalization. The above
issue regards the complex interactions between economy and institutional
policies intended to introduce technological innovations in a society, where
technological innovations are intended in a broad sense comprehending reforms
critical to production. A special focus is placed on the political replacement
effect described in a macroscopic model by Acemoglu and Robinson (AR-model,
henceforth), which can determine the phenomenon of innovation 'blocking',
possibly leading to economic backwardness. One of the goals of our modelization
is to obtain a mesoscopic dynamical model whose macroscopic outputs are
qualitatively comparable with stylized facts of the AR-model. A set of
numerical solutions is presented showing the non monotonous relationship
between economic liberization and political competition, which can be
considered as an emergent phenomenon of the complex socio-economic interaction
dynamic.

  Externality Internalized?",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A commonly expressed concern about the rise of the peer-to-peer rental market
Airbnb is that hosts---those renting out their properties---impose costs on
their unwitting neighbors. I consider the question of whether apartment
building owners will, in a competitive rental market, set a building-specific
Airbnb hosting policy that is socially efficient. I find that if tenants can
sort across apartments based on the owners policy then the equilibrium fraction
of buildings allowing Airbnb listing would be socially efficient.
