wireless systems, referred to as post sparse error detection (PSED) algorithm,
that employs a sparse error recovery algorithm to refine the estimate of a
symbol vector obtained by the conventional linear detector. The PSED algorithm
operates in two steps: 1) sparse transformation converting the original
non-sparse system into the sparse system whose input is an error vector caused
by the symbol slicing and 2) estimation of the error vector using the sparse
recovery algorithm. From the asymptotic mean square error (MSE) analysis and
empirical simulations performed on large-scale systems, we show that the PSED
algorithm brings significant performance gain over classical linear detectors
while imposing relatively small computational overhead.

continuously tuning the electronic and optic properties of materials, while
thermal properties are generally believed to be insensitive to mechanical
strain. In this paper, the strain-dependent thermal conductivity of monolayer
silicene under uniform bi-axial tension is computed by solving the phonon
Boltzmann transport equation with force constants extracted from
first-principles calculations. Unlike the commonly believed understanding that
thermal conductivity only slightly decreases with increased tensile strain for
bulk materials, it is found that the thermal conductivity of silicene first
increases dramatically with strain and then slightly decreases when the applied
strain increases further. At a tensile strain of 4%, the highest thermal
conductivity is found to be about 7.5 times that of unstrained one. Such an
unusual strain dependence is mainly attributed to the dramatic enhancement in
the acoustic phonon lifetime. Such enhancement plausibly originates from the
flattening of the buckling of the silicene structure upon stretching, which is
unique for silicene as compared with other common two-dimensional materials.
Our findings offer perspectives of modulating the thermal properties of
low-dimensional structures for applications such as thermoelectrics, thermal
circuits, and nanoelectronics.

robust enough to tackle the problem of exact matching, yielding the same code
for new samples of a user as the code assigned during training. These codes are
then hashed using any hash function that follows the random oracle model (like
SHA-512) to generate protected face templates (similar to text based password

information from persistent homology computations than is currently done. The
persistent homology algorithm is usually viewed as a procedure which starts
with a filtered complex and ends with a persistence diagram. This procedure is
stable (at least to certain types of perturbations of the input). This
justifies the use of the diagram as a signature of the input, and the use of
features derived from it in statistics and machine learning. However, these
computations also produce other information of great interest to practitioners
that is unfortunately unstable. For example, each point in the diagram
corresponds to a simplex whose addition in the filtration results in the birth
of the corresponding persistent homology class, but this correspondence is
unstable. In addition, the persistence diagram is not stable with respect to
other procedures that are employed in practice, such as thresholding a point
cloud by density. We recast these problems as real-valued functions which are
discontinuous but measurable, and then observe that convolving such a function
with a suitable function produces a Lipschitz function. The resulting stable
function can be estimated by perturbing the input and averaging the output. We
illustrate this approach with a number of examples, including a stable
localization of a persistent homology generator from brain imaging data.

important device applications. The emergence of two-dimensional semiconductors
opens up a new realm for creating heterostructures. As the bandgaps of
transition metal dichalcogenides thin films have sensitive layer dependence, it
is natural to create lateral heterojunctions using the same materials with
different thicknesses. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy,
here we show the real space image of electronic structures across the
bilayer-monolayer interface in MoSe2 and WSe2. Most bilayer-monolayer
heterojunctions are found to have a zigzag-orientated interface, and the band
alignment of such atomically sharp heterojunctions is of type-I with a
well-defined interface mode which acts as a narrower-gap quantum wire. The
ability to utilize such commonly existing thickness terrace as lateral
heterojunctions is a crucial addition to the tool set for device applications
based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides, with the advantage
of easy and flexible implementation.

descent (SGD) by enabling the use of larger, constant stepsizes and preserving
linear convergence rates. However, current variance reduced SGD methods require
either high memory usage or an exact gradient computation (using the entire
dataset) at the end of each epoch. This limits the use of VR methods in
practical distributed settings. In this paper, we propose a variance reduction
method, called VR-lite, that does not require full gradient computations or
extra storage. We explore distributed synchronous and asynchronous variants
that are scalable and remain stable with low communication frequency. We
empirically compare both the sequential and distributed algorithms to
state-of-the-art stochastic optimization methods, and find that our proposed
algorithms perform favorably to other stochastic methods.

by $V({\cal A})=m{}^2\,f{}^2\,[1-\cos({\cal A}\,/\,f)]$, where $m$ and $f$ are
the mass and decay constant of the scalar field. An example of such a theory is
that of the axion, in which case the condensates are called axion stars. The
axion field, $\cal A$, is self adjoint. As a result the axion number is not an
absolutely conserved quantity. Therefore, axion stars are not stable and have
finite lifetimes. Bound axions, localized on the volume of the star, have a
coordinate uncertainty $\Delta x \sim R \sim 1/(m_a \Delta)$, where $R$ is the
radius of the star and $\Delta = \sqrt{1-E_0{}^2\,/\,m_a^2}$. Here $m_a$ and
$E_0$ are the mass, and the ground state energy of the bound axion. Then the
momentum distribution of axions has a width of $\Delta p\sim m_a\,\Delta$. At
strong binding, $\Delta={\cal O}(1)$, bound axions can easily transfer a
sufficient amount of momentum to create and emit a free axion, leading to fast
decay of the star with a transition rate $\Gamma \sim m_a$. However, when
$\Delta\ll 1$, the momentum distribution is more restricted, and as shown in
this paper, the transition rate for creating a free axion decreases as $\exp
(-p \, \Delta x) \sim \exp (-\Delta^{-1})$. Then sufficiently large, weakly
bound axion stars, produced after the big bang, survive until the present time.
We plot the region of their stability, limited by decay through axion loss and
by gravitational instability, as a function of the mass of the axion and the
mass of the star.

(t-1)-design. This is a generalization of the result of Kageyama who proved
this under the stronger assumption that the weight function is constant on the
whole block set. Using this, we define tight relative t-designs for odd t, and
a strong restriction on the possible parameters of tight relative t-designs in
H(n,2). We obtained a new family of such tight relative t-designs, which were
unnoticed before. We will give a list of feasible parameters of such relative
3-designs with n up to 100, and then we discuss the existence and/or the
non-existence of such tight relative 3-designs. We also discuss feasible
parameters of tight relative 4-designs on two shells in H(n,2) with n up 50. In
this study we come up with the connection on the topics of classical design
theory, such as symmetric 2-designs (in particular 2-(4u-1,2u-1,u-1) Hadamard
designs) and Driessen's result on the non-existence of certain 3-designs. We
believe the Problem 1 and Problem 2 presented in Section 5.2 open a new way to
study relative t-designs in H(n,2). We conclude our paper listing several open
problems.

the subset sum problem. That is, given a set of integers, determine whether one

brute-force approach of verifying all combinations of integers, several
solutions have been found, ranging from clever uses of various data structures
to computationally-efficient approximation solutions. In this paper, a unique
approach is discussed which builds upon the existing min-heap solution for
positive integers, introducing a tree-based data structure influenced by the
binomial heap. Termed the subset tree, this data structure solves the subset

retrieval with large-scale data. The similarity between pairs of images can be
measured by the distances between their high dimensional representations, and
the problem of learning the appropriate similarity is often addressed by
distance metric learning. However, distance metric learning requires the
learned metric to be a PSD matrix, which is computational expensive and not
necessary for retrieval ranking problem. On the other hand, the bilinear model
is shown to be more flexible for large-scale image retrieval task, hence, we
adopt it to learn a matrix for estimating pairwise similarities under the
regression framework. By adaptively updating the target matrix in regression,
we can mimic the hinge loss, which is more appropriate for similarity learning
problem. Although the regression problem can have the closed-form solution, the
computational cost can be very expensive. The computational challenges come
from two aspects: the number of images can be very large and image features
have high dimensionality. We address the first challenge by compressing the
data by a randomized algorithm with the theoretical guarantee. For the high
dimensional issue, we address it by taking low rank assumption and applying
alternating method to obtain the partial matrix, which has a global optimal
solution. Empirical studies on real world image datasets (i.e., Caltech and
ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

partition function can be written in terms of local tensors and the tensor
renormalization group blocking can be applied. The numerical implementation
requires truncations and the time continuum limit of the blocked transfer

channel multiple descriptions problem. A well known general region for this
problem is due to Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG) [1]. Their encoding
scheme is an extension of the El-Gamal-Cover (EC) and Zhang- Berger (ZB) coding
schemes to the L channel case and includes a combinatorial number of refinement
codebooks, one for each subset of the descriptions. As in ZB, the scheme also
allows for a single common codeword to be shared by all descriptions. This
paper proposes a novel encoding technique involving Combinatorial Message
Sharing (CMS), where every subset of the descriptions may share a distinct
common message. This introduces a combinatorial number of shared codebooks
along with the refinement codebooks of [1]. We derive an achievable
rate-distortion region for the proposed technique, and show that it subsumes
the VKG region for general sources and distortion measures. We further show
that CMS provides a strict improvement of the achievable region for any source
and distortion measures for which some 2-description subset is such that ZB
achieves points outside the EC region. We then show a more surprising result:
CMS outperforms VKG for a general class of sources and distortion measures,
including scenarios where the ZB and EC regions coincide for all 2-description
subsets. In particular, we show that CMS strictly improves on VKG, for the
L-channel quadratic Gaussian MD problem, for all L greater than or equal to 3,
despite the fact that the EC region is complete for the corresponding

used to support high-consequence decisions related to turbulent flows. Apart
from the deterministic model predictions, the decision makers are often equally
concerned about the predictions confidence. Among the uncertainties in RANS
simulations, the model-form uncertainty is an important or even a dominant
source. Therefore, quantifying and reducing the model-form uncertainties in
RANS simulations are of critical importance to make risk-informed decisions.
Researchers in statistics communities have made efforts on this issue by
considering numerical models as black boxes. However, this physics-neutral
approach is not a most efficient use of data, and is not practical for most
engineering problems. Recently, we proposed an open-box, Bayesian framework for
quantifying and reducing model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by
incorporating observation data and physics-prior knowledge. It can incorporate
the information from the vast body of existing empirical knowledge with
mathematical rigor, which enables a more efficient usage of data. In this work,
we examine the merits of incorporating various types of prior knowledge in the
uncertainties quantification and reduction in RANS simulations. The result
demonstrates that informative physics-based prior plays an important role in
improving the quantification of model-form uncertainties, particularly when the
observation data are limited. Moreover, it suggests that the proposed Bayesian
framework is an effective way to incorporate empirical knowledge from various
sources.

interference channel using different changing patterns between different users,
we propose several methods to align some parts of interferences and to increase
what is achieved by time sharing method. For more practical case when all the
channel links connected to the same destination have the same changing pattern,
we find an upper-bound and analyze it for the large interference channel
network. This result shows that when the size of the network increases, the
upper-bound value goes to $\frac{\sqrt{K}}{2}$. For the fast fading channel
when all the channels have the same changing pattern, we show that when the
direct links have different characteristic functions (channel permutation or
memory), in the absence of half part of CSI (cross links) at both transmitters
and receivers, one can achieve $K/2$ degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Also by the
converse proof we show that this is the minimum channel information to achieve
maximum DoF of $\frac{K}{2}$. Throughout this work, this fact has been
pinpointed to prove statements about more general partial state CSI and
achievable DoF. In other words, for the 3-user fully connected interference
channel we find out while $\frac{3}{2}$ lies in achievable DoF, we don't need
to know half part of the CSI. Also, the result has been extended to a more
general form for $K-$user interference channel and through the converse proof,
its functionality on channel state is proved to be optimum.

divergence growth at element interfaces due to the discontinuous nature of the
discretization used. This spurious divergence eventually leads to a numerical
instability. Previous work has shown that a discontinuous element-local
projection onto the space of divergence-free basis functions is capable of
stabilizing the projection method, but the discontinuity inherent in this
technique may lead to instability in under-resolved simulations. By enforcing
inter-element discontinuity and requiring a divergence-free result in the weak
sense only, a new post-processing technique is developed that simultaneously
improves smoothness and reduces divergence in the pressure-projected velocity
field at the same time. When compared against a non-post-processed velocity
field, the post-processed velocity field remains stable far longer and exhibits
better smoothness and conservation properties.

to network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where
the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties.
Next, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen
game-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as
the payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of
game-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according
to their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role
played by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is
that the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally
challenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a
wide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in
polynomial time. Our focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and
its various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues.
Furthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in
connectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it. Finally, we analyse
computational properties of generalized version of cooperative games in which
order of player matters. We propose a new representation for such games, called
generalized marginal contribution networks, that allows for polynomial
computation in the size of the representation of two dedicated extensions of
the Shapley value to this class of games.

states, called the maximally Bell inequality violating states (MBV), which
exhibit maximum Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite system for a
fixed amount of genuine tripartite entanglement quantified by the so called
tangle measure. This in turn implies that there holds a complementary relation
between the Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite systems and the
tangle present in the three qubit states, not necessarily pure. The MBV states
also exhibit maximum Bell inequality violation by the reduced bipartite systems
of the three qubit pure states with a fixed amount of genuine tripartite
correlation quantified by the generalized geometric measure, a genuine
entanglement measure of multiparty pure states, and the discord monogamy score,
a multipartite quantum correlation measure from information theoretic paradigm.
The aforementioned complementary relation has also been established for three
qubit pure states for the generalized geometric measure and the discord
monogamy score respectively. The complementarity between the Bell inequality
violation by the reduced bipartite systems and the genuine tripartite
correlation suggests that the Bell inequality violation in the reduced two
qubit system comes at the cost of the total tripartite correlation present in
the entire system.

optimization principle (AOP) is proposed for the ground states of translational
invariant strongly-correlated quantum lattice models. The idea is to transform
a nondeterministic-polynomial-hard ground state simulation with infinite
degrees of freedom into a single optimization problem of a local function with
finite number of physical and ancillary degrees of freedom. This work
contributes mainly in the following aspects: 1) AOP provides a simple and
efficient scheme to simulate the ground state by solving a local optimization
problem. Its solution contains two kinds of boundary states, one of which play
the role of the entanglement bath that mimic the interactions between a
supercell and the infinite environment, and the other give the ground state in
a tensor network (TN) form. 2) In the sense of TN, a novel decomposition named
as tensor ring decomposition (TRD) is proposed to implement AOP. Instead of
following the contraction-truncation scheme used by many existing TN-based
algorithms, TRD solves the contraction of a uniform TN in an opposite clue by
encoding the contraction in a set of self-consistent equations that
automatically reconstruct the whole TN, making the simulation simple and
unified; 3) AOP inherits and develops the ideas of different well-established
methods, including the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), infinite
time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD), network contractor dynamics, density
matrix embedding theory, and etc., providing a unified perspective that is
previously missing in this fields; 4) AOP as well as TRD gives novel
implications to existing TN-based algorithms: a modified iTEBD is suggested and
the 2D AOP is argued to be an intrinsic 2D extension of DMRG that is based on
infinite projected entangled pair state.

promising vectors for gene therapy applications. Their appeal stems from their
non pathogenic nature and the fact that they self-assemble under conditions of
thermal equilibrium. Lipoplex adhesion to the cell plasma membrane initiates a
three-stage process termed transfection, consisting of (i) endocytosis, (ii)
lipoplex breakdown, and (iii) DNA release followed by gene expression. As
successful transfection requires lipoplex degradation, it tends to be hindered
by the lipoplex thermodynamic stability; nevertheless, it is known that the
transfection process may proceed spontaneously. Here, we use a simple model to
study the thermodynamic driving forces governing transfection. We demonstrate
that after endocytosis [stage (i)], the lipoplex becomes inherently unstable.
This instability, which is triggered by interactions between the cationic
lipids of the lipoplex and the anionic lipids of the enveloping plasma
membrane, is entropically controlled involving both remixing of the lipids and
counterions release. Our detailed calculation shows that the free energy gain
during stage (ii) is approximately linear in $\Phi_+$, the mole fraction of
cationic lipids in the lipoplex. This free energy gain, $\Delta F$, reduces the
barrier for fusion between the enveloping and the lipoplex bilayers, which
produces a hole allowing for DNA release [stage (iii)]. The linear relationship
between $\Delta F$ and the fraction of cationic lipids explains the
experimentally observed exponential increase of transfection efficiency with
$\Phi_+$ in lamellar lipoplexes.

and its solutes into ions, and the re-association of these ions into neutral
molecules in a dynamic equilibrium, e.g., ${\rm H_2O_2}\leftrightharpoons {\rm

reactions on the self-propulsion of colloids driven by surface chemical
reactions (chemical swimmers) in aqueous solution. The association-dissociation
reactions are here shown to have a strong influence on the swimmers' behaviour,
and must therefore be included in future modelling. In particular, such bulk
reactions permit charged swimmers to propel electrophoretically even if all
species involved in the surface reactions are neutral. The bulk reactions also
significantly modify the predicted speed of chemical swimmers propelled by
ionic currents, by up to an order of magnitude. For swimmers whose surface
reactions produce both anions and cations (ionic self-diffusiophoresis), the
bulk reactions produce an additional reactive screening length, analogous to
the Debye length in electrostatics. This in turn leads to an inverse
relationship between swimmer radius and swimming speed, which could provide an
alternative explanation for recent experimental observations on Pt-polystyrene
Janus swimmers [S. Ebbens et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 020401 (2012)]. We also use
our continuum theory to investigate the effect of the Debye screening length
itself, going beyond the infinitely thin limit approximation used by previous
analytical theories. We identify significant departures from this limiting
behavior for micron-sized swimmers under typical experimental conditions, and
find that the limiting behavior fails entirely for nanoscale swimmers.

  In this work we aim to fill this gap by presenting how k-trails can be

connection, we resolve several open questions about k-trails. In particular, we
show that one can recognize efficiently whether a graph is a k-trail.
Furthermore, we show that deciding whether a graph contains a k-trail is
NP-complete; however, every graph that contains a k-trail is a (k+1)-trail.
Moreover, further leveraging the connection to matroids, we consider the
problem of finding a minimum weight k-trail contained in a graph G. We show
that one can efficiently find a (2k-1)-trail contained in G whose weight is no
more than the cheapest k-trail contained in G, even when allowing negative
weights.

Polyakov's formulation of non critical string theory. Moreover, scaling limits
of statistical mechanics models on planar maps are believed by physicists to be
described by LCFT. A rigorous probabilistic formulation of LCFT based on a path
integral formulation was recently given by the present authors and F. David in
\cite{DKRV}. In the present work, we prove the validity of the conformal Ward
identities and the Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (BPZ) differential equations
(of order $2$) for the correlation functions of LCFT. This initiates the
program started in the seminal work of Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov
\cite{BPZ} in a probabilistic setup for a non-trivial Conformal Field Theory.
We also prove several celebrated results on LCFT, in particular an explicit
formula for the 4 point correlation functions (with insertion of a second order
degenerate field) leading to a rigorous proof of a non trivial functional
relation on the 3 point structure constants derived earlier in the physics
literature by Teschner \cite{Tesc}. The proofs are based on exact identities
which rely on the underlying Gaussian structure of LCFT combined with estimates
from the theory of critical Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos and a careful
analysis of singular integrals (Beurling transforms and generalizations). As a
by-product, we give bounds on the correlation functions when two points collide
making rigorous certain predictions from physics on the so-called ""operator
product expansion"" of LCFT.

conclude that dynamical instability occurs if the gaseous sphere contracts to
the Reissner-Nordst\""orm radius for different values of charge.

normed space satisfying certain natural conditions suggested by the partially
ordered Jordan algebra of bounded Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space. The
adjective ""synaptic,"" borrowed from biology, is meant to suggest that such an
algebra coherently ""ties together"" the notions of a Jordan algebra, a spectral
order-unit normed space, a convex effect algebra, and an orthomodular lattice.
Prototypic examples of synaptic algebras are the special Jordan algebra of all
self-adjoint elements in a von Neumann algebra, the self-adjoint elements in a
Rickart C*-algebra, the self-adjoint elements in an AW*-algebra, D. Topping's
JW- and AJW-algebras, and the generalized Hermitian (GH-) algebras introduced
and studied by the author and S. Pulmannov\'a. All the foregoing examples are
norm complete, but synaptic algebras are more general, and even a commutative
synaptic algebra need not be norm complete.
