characteristic p > 0) and to any maximal torus T of G, we attach a family of
extended affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties (and families of torsors over them)
over the residue field of F. This construction generalizes affine
Deligne-Lusztig varieties of Rapoport, which are attached only to unramified
tori of G. Via this construction, we can attach to any maximal torus T of G and
any character of T a representation of G. This procedure should conjecturally
realize the automorphic induction from T to G.
  For G = GL_2, we prove that our construction indeed realizes the automorphic
induction from at most tamely ramified tori. Moreover, if the torus is purely
tamely ramified, then the varieties realizing this correspondence are
zero-dimensional and reduced, i.e., just disjoint unions of points.

neutrino mass, has couplings to $(\nu_e,\nu_{\mu},\nu_{\tau})$ proportional to
$(0,1,1)$, while the subdominant right-handed neutrino, mainly responsible for
the solar neutrino mass, has couplings to $(\nu_e,\nu_{\mu},\nu_{\tau})$
proportional to $(1,n,n-2)$. This constrained sequential dominance (CSD) model
preserves the first column of the tri-bimaximal (TB) mixing matrix (TM1) and
has a reactor angle $\theta_{13} \sim (n-1) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}
\frac{m_2}{m_3}$. This is a generalisation of CSD ($n=1$) which led to TB
mixing and arises almost as easily if $n\geq 1$ is a real number. We derive
exact analytic formulas for the neutrino masses, lepton mixing angles and CP
phases in terms of the four input parameters and discuss exact sum rules. We
show how CSD ($n=3$) may arise from vacuum alignment due to residual symmetries
of $S_4$. We propose a benchmark model based on $S_4\times Z_3\times Z'_3$,
which fixes $n=3$ and the leptogenesis phase $\eta = 2\pi/3$, leaving only two
inputs $m_a$ and $m_b=m_{ee}$ describing $\Delta m^2_{31}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$
and $U_{PMNS}$. The LS model predicts a normal mass hierarchy with a massless
neutrino $m_1=0$ and TM1 atmospheric sum rules. The benchmark LS model
additionally predicts: solar angle $\theta_{12}=34^\circ$, reactor angle
$\theta_{13}=8.7^\circ$, atmospheric angle $\theta_{23}=46^\circ$, and Dirac
phase $\delta_{CP}=-87^{\circ}$.

detecting gravitational waves (GWs) which are generated during the phase
transitions through the cosmic microwave background (CMB). If happened around
the inflation era, the first-order CPTs may yield low-frequency GWs due to
bubble dynamics, leaving imprints on the CMB. In contrast to the nearly
scale-invariant primordial GWs caused by vacuum fluctuation, these
bubble-generated GWs are scale dependent and have non-trivial B-mode spectra.
If decoupled from inflaton, the EWPT during inflation may serve as a probe for
the one after reheating where the baryon asymmetry could be generated via EW
baryogenesis (EWBG). The CMB thus provides a potential way to test the
feasibility of the EWBG, complementary to the collider measurements of Higgs
potential and the direct detection of GWs generated during EWPT.

first time a supersymmetric extension of the Skyrme term in four spacetime
dimensions, in the manifestly supersymmetric superfield formalism that does not
suffer from the auxiliary field problem. Chiral symmetry breaking in
supersymmetric theories results not only in Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons (pions)

described by an SL(N,C)-valued matrix field instead of SU(N) for NG bosons. The
solution of auxiliary fields is trivial on the canonical branch of the
auxiliary field equation, in which case our model results in a fourth-order

explicitly a nontrivial solution to the algebraic auxiliary field equations
that we call a non-canonical branch, which when substituted back into the
Lagrangian gives a Skyrme-like model. If we restrict to a submanifold, where
quasi-NG bosons are turned off, which is tantamount to restricting the Skyrme
field to SU(2), then the fourth-order derivative term reduces exactly to the
standard Skyrme term. Our model is the first example of a nontrivial auxiliary
field solution in a multi-component model.

of surrogate models: the deterministic and the probabilistic ones. These last
are generally based on Gaussian assumptions. The main advantage of
probabilistic approach is that it provides a measure of uncertainty associated

tool to construct strategies for various problems such as prediction
enhancement, optimization or inversion.In this paper, we propose a universal

allows to study how these multiparticle sprays are modified as they pass
through the quark-gluon plasma. In order to shed new light on this process, we
compute the inclusive two-gluon rate off a hard quark propagating through a
color deconfined medium at first order in medium opacity. We explicitly impose
an energy ordering of the two emitted gluons, such that the ""hard"" gluon can be
thought of as belonging to the jet substructure while the other is a ""soft""
emission (which can be collinear or medium-induced). Our analysis focusses on
two specific limits that clarify the modification of the additional angle- and
formation time-ordering of splittings. In one limit, the formation time of the
""hard"" gluon is short compared to the ""soft"" gluon formation time, leading to a
probabilistic formula for production of and subsequent radiation off a
quark-gluon antenna. In the other limit, the ordering of formation is reverted,
which automatically leads to the fact that the jet substructure is resolved by
the medium. We observe in this case a characteristic delay: the jet radiates as
one color current (quark) up to the formation of the ""hard"" gluon, at which
point we observe the onset of radiation of the new color current (gluon). Our
computation supports a picture in which the in-medium jet dynamics are
described as a collection of subsequent antennas which are resolved by the
medium according to their transverse extent.

smooth functions) varying over a continuum, which are usually collected with
measurement errors on discretized grids. In order to accurately smooth noisy
functional observations and deal with the issue of high-dimensional observation
grids, we propose a novel Bayesian method based on the Bayesian hierarchical
model with a Gaussian-Wishart process prior and basis function representations.
We first derive an induced model for the basis-function coefficients of the
functional data, and then use this model to conduct posterior inference through
Markov chain Monte Carlo. Compared to the standard Bayesian inference that
suffers serious computational burden and unstableness for analyzing
high-dimensional functional data, our method greatly improves the computational
scalability and stability, while inheriting the advantage of simultaneously
smoothing raw observations and estimating the mean-covariance functions in a
nonparametric way. In addition, our method can naturally handle functional data
observed on random or uncommon grids. Simulation and real studies demonstrate
that our method produces similar results as the standard Bayesian inference
with low-dimensional common grids, while efficiently smoothing and estimating
functional data with random and high-dimensional observation grids where the
standard Bayesian inference fails. In conclusion, our method can efficiently
smooth and estimate high-dimensional functional data, providing one way to

simplicial $\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition, weaker than the
Segal condition, expressed in terms of active and inert maps in Delta. Just as
the Segal condition expresses composition, the new condition expresses
decomposition, and there is an abundance of examples in combinatorics. After
establishing some basic properties of decomposition spaces, the main result of
this first paper shows that to any decomposition space there is an associated
incidence coalgebra, spanned by the space of 1-simplices, and with coefficients
in $\infty$-groupoids. We take a functorial viewpoint throughout, emphasising
conservative ULF functors; these induce coalgebra homomorphisms. Reduction
procedures in the classical theory of incidence coalgebras are examples of this
notion, and many are examples of decalage of decomposition spaces. An
interesting class of examples of decomposition spaces beyond Segal spaces is
provided by Hall algebras: the Waldhausen S-construction of an abelian (or
stable infinity) category is shown to be a decomposition space. Note: The

weaker than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses

introduce various technical conditions on decomposition spaces. The first is a
completeness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control
simplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a
general M\""obius inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of
$\infty$-groupoids. Next we analyse two finiteness conditions on decomposition
spaces. The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees the existence of
the important length filtration on the associated incidence coalgebra. We show
that a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan
extension of a semi-simplicial space. The second finiteness condition, local
finiteness, ensures we can take homotopy cardinality to pass from the level of
$\infty$-groupoids to the level of vector spaces. These three conditions -
completeness, locally finite length, and local finiteness - together define our
notion of M\""obius decomposition space, which extends Leroux's notion of
M\""obius category (in turn a common generalisation of the locally finite posets
of Rota et al. and of the finite decomposition monoids of Cartier-Foata), but
which also covers many coalgebra constructions which do not arise from M\""obius

pairing interaction. In particular, we show the peculiar features of the
nuclear pairing interaction in the low density regime, and possible outcomes
such as the BCS-BEC crossover in nuclear matter and, in an analogous way, in
loosely bound nuclei. We then move to the competition between T=1 and T=0
pairing correlations. The effect of such competition on the low-lying spectra
is studied in N=Z odd-odd nuclei by using a three-body model; it is shown that
the inversion of the 0+ and 1+ states near the ground state, and the strong
magnetic dipole transitions between them, can be considered as a clear
manifestation of strong T=0 pairing correlations in these nuclei. The effect of
T=0 pairing correlations is also quite evident if one studies charge-changing
transitions. The Gamow-Teller (GT) states in N=Z+2 nuclei are studied here by
using self-consistent HFB+QRPA calculations in which the T=0 pairing
interaction is taken into account. Strong GT states are found, near the ground
state of daughter nuclei; these are compared with available experimental data
from charge-exchange reactions, and such comparison can pinpoint the value of
the strength of the T=0 interaction. Pair transfer reactions are eventually
discussed: while two-neutron transfer has been long proposed as a tool to
measure the T=1 superfluidity in the nuclear ground states, the study of
deuteron transfer is still in its infancy, despite its potential interest in
revealing effects coming from both T=1 and T=0 interactions.

Biane and R. Speicher in 1998 as a non-commutative counterpart of classical
Wiener-It\^o integrals and the corresponding Wiener-It\^o chaos, respectively,
in free probability.
  In the classical case, a famous result of I. Shigekawa states that
non-trivial elements in the finite Wiener-It\^o chaos have an absolutely
continuous distribution. We provide here a first contribution to such
regularity questions for Wigner integrals by showing that the distribution of
non-trivial elements in the finite Wigner chaos cannot have atoms. This answers
a question of I. Nourdin and G. Peccati.
  For doing so, we establish the notion of directional gradients in the context
of the free Malliavin calculus. These directional gradients bridge between free
Malliavin calculus and the theory of non-commutative derivations as initiated
by D. Voiculescu and Y. Dabrowski. Methods recently invented by R. Speicher, M.
Weber, and the author for treating similar questions in the case of finitely
many variables are extended, such that they apply to directional gradients.
This approach also excludes zero-divisors for the considered elements in the
finite Wigner chaos.

Using these time series, one can estimate frequency-band specific functional
connectivity between sensors or regions of interest, and thereby construct
functional brain networks that can be examined from a graph theoretic
perspective. Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the
choice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely
undelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT
vs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least
Asymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24) - each
essential parameters in wavelet-based methods - on the estimated values of
network diagnostics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric
disease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than
the DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen
has a greater impact on the estimated values of network diagnostics than the
type of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of
the method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes
classification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of
wavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity
of these methods in estimating values of network diagnostics drawn from graph
theory. They furthermore demonstrate the importance of reporting the choices
utilized in neuroimaging studies and support the utility of exploring wavelet
parameters to maximize classification accuracy in the development of biomarkers

group VI elements (Y = O, S, Se, Te) in three geometrical configurations, the
puckered, buckled and planar structures. The results of binding energy

It is observed that, the puckered structure, similar to that of phosphorene, is
the energetically most stable geometric configuration. Our results of
electronic band structure predict that puckered SiO and CSe are direct band
semiconductors with gaps of 1.449 and 0.905 eV, respectively. Band structure of
CSe closely resembles that of phosphorene. Remaining group IV-VI binary
monolayers in the puckered configuration and all the buckled monolayers are
also semiconductors, but with indirect band gaps. Importantly, we find that the
difference between indirect and direct band gaps is very small for many
puckered monolayers. Thus, there is a possibility of making these systems
undergo transition from indirect to direct band gap semiconducting state by a
suitable external influence. Indeed, we show in the present work that seven
binary monolayers namely SnS, SiSe, GeSe, SnSe, SiTe, GeTe and SnTe become
direct band gap semiconductors when they are subjected to a small mechanical

in which quantum mechanics overcomes thermalization of statistical mechanics.
Like Anderson localization of non-interacting electrons, disorders are usually
crucial in engineering the quantum interference in MBL. For translation
invariant systems, however, the breakdown of eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis due to a \emph{pure} many-body quantum effect is still unclear. Here
we demonstrate a possible MBL phenomenon without disorder, which emerges in a
lightly doped Hubbard model with very strong interaction. By means of density
matrix renormalization group numerical calculation on a two-leg ladder, we show
that whereas a single hole can induce a very heavy Nagaoka polaron, two or more
holes will form bound pair/droplets which are all localized excitations with
flat bands at low energy densities. Consequently, MBL eigenstates of finite
energy density can be constructed as composed of these localized droplets
spatially separated. We further identify the underlying mechanism for this MBL
as due to a novel `Berry phase' of the doped Mott insulator, and show that by
turning off this Berry phase either by increasing the anisotropy of the model
or by hand, an eigenstate transition from the MBL to a conventional
quasiparticle phase can be realized.

While the early transition metals (TMs, group IVB, VB , and VIB elements)

sit on the Al sublattice for all four phases. B and C are shown to prefer
octahedral Ti-rich interstitial positions instead of substitutional

changes of energy of formation, hence alloying-related (de)stabilisation of the

step towards extending this result to non- self adjoint perturbations, though,
for technical reason, we restrict ourselves here to weak perturbations of

by KAM theory, with frustration-free operators playing the role of integrable
Hamiltonians.

accompanies a non-negligible risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP). This study
presents a Bayesian network (BN) model that connects biological, dosimetric,
and clinical RP risk factors. Material and Methods: 43 non-small-cell lung
cancer patients treated with SBRT with 5 fractions or less were studied.
Candidate RP risk factors included dose-volume parameters, previously reported
clinical RP factors, 6 protein biomarkers at baseline and 6 weeks
post-treatment. A BN ensemble model was built from a subset of the variables in
a training cohort (N=32), and further tested in an independent validation
cohort (N=11). Results: Key factors identified in the BN ensemble for
predicting RP risk were ipsilateral V5, lung volume receiving more than 105% of
prescription, and decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) from baseline
to 6 weeks. External validation of the BN ensemble model yielded an area under
the curve of 0.8. Conclusions: The BN model identified potential key players in
SBRT-induced RP such as high dose spillage in lung and changes in ACE
expression levels. Predictive potential of the model is promising due to its
probabilistic characteristics.

require the addition of exotics in the visible sector. We study such exotics
and demonstrate that they may account for the modest excess at $750$ GeV in
recent diphoton resonance searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations. In a previous analysis of type II MSSM D-brane quivers we
systematically added up to five exotics for the sake of satisfying string
consistency conditions. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that 89780 of the
89964 quivers have exotics, 78155 of which include singlets that may couple to
MSSM or exotic multiplets with coupling structures governed by $U(1)$
symmetries that are often anomalous. We demonstrate that certain sets of
exotics are far preferred over others and study the structure of singlet
couplings to heavy exotics carrying standard model charges. Typical
possibilities include singlets that may decay to vector-like quarks and / or
vector-like leptons and subsequently to two photons. We show that a narrow
width diphoton excess can be accounted for while evading existing bounds if
multiple exotics are added, with vector-like leptons of mass $M_L\lesssim 375$
GeV and vector-like quarks with masses up to $\simeq 3$ TeV. However, a large
width $(\Gamma/M \sim 0.06)$, as suggested by the ATLAS data, cannot be easily
accommodated in this framework. Renormalization group equations with GUT-scale
boundary conditions show that these supersymmetric models are perturbative and
stable. Type IIA compactifications on toroidal orbifolds allow for $O(10)$
Yukawa couplings in the ultraviolet. We also discuss the possibility of
accounting for the diphoton excess in a low string scale scenario via the decay
of string axions.

13 TeV LHC is a (pseudo)scalar with mass around 750 GeV, which couples to a
gluon pair and to a photon pair through loops involving vector-like quarks
(VLQs). To accommodate the observed rate, the required Yukawa couplings tend to
be large. A large Yukawa coupling would rapidly run up with the scale and
quickly reach the perturbativity bound, indicating that new physics, possibly
with a strong dynamics origin, is near by. The case becomes stronger especially
if the ATLAS observation of a large width persists. In this paper we study the
implication on the scale of new physics from the 750 GeV diphoton excess using
the method of renormalization group running with careful treatment of different
contributions and perturbativity criterion. Our results suggest that the scale
of new physics is generically not much larger than the TeV scale, in particular
if the width of the hinted (pseudo)scalar is large. Introducing multiple copies
of VLQs, lowing the VLQ masses and enlarging VLQ electric charges help reduce
the required Yukawa couplings and can push the cutoff scale to higher values.
Nevertheless, if the width of the 750 GeV resonance turns out to be larger than
about 1 GeV, it is very hard to increase the cutoff scale beyond a few TeVs.
This is a strong hint that new particles in addition to the 750 GeV resonance
and the vector-like quarks should be around the TeV scale.

we find a substantial improvement of EFT of LSS (with one free parameter) over

unaccounted for systematics, highlighting the need for improved numerical and

quasi-one-dimensional bosonic superfluid with attractive interactions.
Specifically, we focus on the dissipative forces experienced by the soliton due
to its interaction with Bogoliubov excitations. Using the collective coordinate
approach and the Keldysh formalism, a Langevin equation of motion for the
soliton is derived from the first principle. The equation contains a stochastic
Langevin force (associated with quantum noise) and a non-local in time
dissipative force, which appears due to inelastic scattering of Bogoliubov
quasiparticles off of the moving soliton. It is shown that Ohmic friction
(i.e., a term proportional to the soliton's velocity) is absent in the
integrable setup. However, the Markovian approximation gives rise to the
Abraham-Lorentz force (i.e., a term proportional to the derivative of the
soliton's acceleration), which is known from classical electrodynamics of a
charged particle interacting with its own radiation. These Abraham-Lorentz
equations famously contain a fundamental causality paradox, where the
soliton/particle interacts with excitations/radiation originating from future
events. We show, however, that the causality paradox is an artifact of the
Markovian approximation, and our exact non-Markovian dissipative equations give
rise to physical trajectories. We argue that the quantum friction discussed

that this operator has empty absolutely continuous spectrum and that the
Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum; hence, this model exhibits Cantor
spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure for all irrational frequencies and arbitrary
phase, which in physics is known as Hofstadter's butterfly. In fact, we will
show something stronger, namely, that all spectral parameters in the spectrum
are of critical type, in the language of Avila's global theory of analytic
quasiperiodic cocycles. We further prove that it has empty point spectrum for
each irrational frequency and away from a frequency-dependent set of phases

adaptation of Avila's Global Theory to the present setting, self-duality via

smooth walls is given. Using the on-shell flame description, equations
describing quasi-steady flame with a small but finite front thickness are
obtained and solved numerically. It is found that near the limits of
inflammability, solutions describing upward flame propagation come in pairs
having close propagation speeds, and that the effect of gravity is to reverse
the burnt gas velocity profile generated by the flame. On the basis of these
results, a theory of partial flame propagation driven by the gravitational
field is developed. A complete explanation is given of the intricate observed
behavior of limit flames, including dependence of the inflammability range on
the size of the combustion domain, the large distances of partial flame
propagation, and the progression of flame extinction. The role of the finite
front-thickness effects is discussed in detail. Also, various mechanisms
governing flame acceleration in smooth tubes are identified. Acceleration of
methane-air flames in open tubes is shown to be a combined effect of the
hydrostatic pressure difference produced by the ambient cold air and the
difference of dynamic gas pressure at the tube ends. On the other hand, a
strong spontaneous acceleration of the fast methane-oxygen flames at the
initial stage of their evolution in open-closed tubes is conditioned by
metastability of the quasi-steady propagation regimes. An extensive comparison
of the obtained results with the experimental data is made.

bulk material properties by modelling and remodelling processes. Modelling
synthesises tissue in some regions and removes tissue in others. Remodelling
overwrites old tissue material properties with newly formed, immature tissue
properties. As a result, tissues are made up of different ""patches"", i.e.,
adjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,
within evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the
spatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum
model. These equations take into account nonconservative, discontinuous surface
mass balance due to creation and destruction of material at moving interfaces,
and bulk balance due to tissue maturation. These equations make it possible to
model patchy tissue states and their evolution without explicitly maintaining a
record of when/where resorption and formation processes occurred. The time
evolution of spatially averaged tissue properties is derived systematically by
integration. These spatially-averaged equations cannot be written in closed
form as they retain traces that tissue destruction is localised at tissue
boundaries.
  The formalism developed in this paper is applied to bone tissues, which
exhibit strong material heterogeneities due to their slow mineralisation and
remodelling processes. Evolution equations are proposed in particular for
osteocyte density and bone mineral density. Effective average equations for
bone mineral density (BMD) and tissue mineral density (TMD) are derived using a
mean-field approximation. The error made by this approximation when remodelling
patchy tissue is investigated. The specific time signatures of BMD or TMD
during remodelling events may provide a way to detect these events occurring at
lower, unseen spatial resolutions from microCT scans.

scheduling, higher criticality tasks are given precedence over those of lower
criticality when it is impossible to guarantee the schedulability of all tasks.
While mixed-criticality scheduling has gained attention in recent years, most
approaches typically assume a periodic task model. This assumption does not
always hold in practice, especially for real-time and embedded systems that
perform I/O. For example, many tasks block on I/O requests until devices signal
their completion via interrupts; both the arrival of interrupts and the waking
of blocked tasks can be aperiodic. In our prior work, we developed a scheduling
technique in the Quest real-time operating system, which integrates the
time-budgeted management of I/O operations with Sporadic Server scheduling of
tasks. This paper extends our previous scheduling approach with support for
mixed-criticality tasks and I/O requests on the same processing core. Results
show the effective schedulability of different task sets in the presence of I/O
requests is superior in our approach compared to traditional methods that
manage I/O using techniques such as Sporadic Servers.

popular in many practical PDE-based inverse problems, in the context of option

usually more accessible for this application than for many others, the data is
often given only at a restricted set of locations. We show that attempts to
""complete missing data"" by approximation or interpolation, proposed in the
literature, may produce results that are inferior to treating the data as

uncertainty in data locations, and we show how a model-based adjustment of the
asset price may prove advantageous in such situations. We further compare a
carefully calibrated Tikhonov-type regularization approach against a similarly
adapted EnKF method, in an attempt to fine-tune the data assimilation process.
The EnKF method offers reassurance as a different method for assessing the
solution in a problem where information about the true solution is difficult to
come by. However, additional advantage in the latter approach turns out to be
limited in our context.

attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern
Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a
measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC
algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for
large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient
thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a
thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior
distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion
increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so
better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use
of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the
traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more
accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be
desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical
models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves
general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models.

bolometers and causes cross talk. They should be controlled well to reduce
systematic errors in CMB observations. We have been developing a cryogenic
readout with a low series impedance and have tuned bolometers in the middle of
their transition at a high frequency (> 3 MHz).

the key to identifying the most distant bursts before the optical afterglow
becomes too dim to warrant a good spectrum. Here we introduce ""machine-z"", a
redshift prediction algorithm and a ""high-z"" classifier for Swift GRBs based on
machine learning. Our method relies exclusively on canonical data commonly
available within the first few hours after the GRB trigger. Using a sample of
284 bursts with measured redshifts, we trained a randomized ensemble of
decision trees (random forest) to perform both regression and classification.
Cross-validated performance studies show that the correlation coefficient

time our high-z classifier can achieve 80% recall of true high-redshift bursts,
while incurring a false positive rate of 20%. With 40% false positive rate the
classifier can achieve ~100% recall. The most reliable selection of

the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC may be interpreted as first contact
with a ""dark"" sector with a spontaneously broken conformal symmetry. The
implied TeV scale of the dark sector may be motivated by the interaction
strength required to accommodate a viable thermal relic dark matter (DM)
candidate. We model the conformal dynamics using a Randall-Sundrum type 5D
geometry whose IR boundary is identified with the dynamics of the composite
dark sector, while the Standard Model (SM) matter content resides on the UV
boundary, corresponding to ""elementary"" fields. We allow the gauge fields to
reside in the 5D bulk, which can be minimally chosen to be $SU(3)_c\times
U(1)_Y$. The ""dark"" radion is identified as the putative 750 GeV resonance.
Heavy vector-like fermions, often invoked to explain the diphoton excess, are
not explicitly present in our model and are not predicted to appear in the
spectrum of TeV scale states. Our minimal setup favors scalar DM of
$\mathcal{O}(\text{TeV})$ mass. A generic expectation in this scenario,
suggested by DM considerations, is the appearance of vector bosons at $\sim$
few TeV, corresponding to the gluon and hypercharge Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes
that couple to UV boundary states with strengths that are suppressed uniformly
compared to their SM values. Our analysis suggests that these KK modes could be
within the reach of the LHC in the coming years.

adaptable processes as a way of overcoming the limitations that process calculi
have for describing patterns of dynamic process evolution. Such patterns rely
on direct ways of controlling the behavior and location of running processes,
and so they are at the heart of the adaptation capabilities present in many
modern concurrent systems. Adaptable processes have named scopes and are
sensible to actions of dynamic update at runtime; this allows to express
dynamic and static topologies of adaptable processes as well as different
evolvability patterns for concurrent processes. We introduce a core calculus of
adaptable processes and consider verification problems for them: first based on
specific properties related to error occurrence, that we call bounded and
eventual adaptation, and then by considering a simple yet expressive temporal
logic over adaptable processes. We provide (un)decidability results of such
verification problems over adaptable processes considering the spectrum of
topologies/evolvability patterns introduced. We then consider distributed
adaptability, where a process can update part of a protocol by performing
dynamic distributed updates over a set of protocol participants. Dynamic
updates in this context are presented as an extension of our work on
choreographies and behavioural contracts in multiparty interactions. We show
how update mechanisms considered for adaptable processes can be used to extend
the theory of choreography and orchestration/contracts, allowing them to be
modified at run-time by internal (self-adaptation) or external intervention.

compounds has been extensively investigated during last two decades, not only
due to their potential applications for magnetic refrigeration but also for
better understanding of the fundamental problems of the materials. This paper
reviews our recent progress of magnetic properties and MCE in some binary or
ternary intermetallic compounds of RE with low boiling point metal(s) (Zn, Mg,
and Cd). Some of them are exhibiting promising MCE properties which make them
also attractive for low temperature magnetic refrigeration. Characteristics of
the magnetic transition, origin of large MCE as well as the potential
application of these compounds were thoroughly discussed. Additionally, a brief
review of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties in the quaternary rare
earth nickel boroncarbides RENi2B2C superconductors is also presented.

a vortex, which induces an effective potential well in the second component,

well may support not only the fundamental bound state, but also multi-ring
excited radial state complexes for suitable ranges of values of the dispersion

stability, and nonlinear dynamics of these states. The complexes involving the
excited radial states are weakly unstable, with a growth rate depending on the
dispersion of the second component. Their evolution leads to transformation of
the multi-ring complexes into stable VB solitons ones with the fundamental

harmonic-oscillator trapping potential, as well as by unequal strengths of the
self- and cross-repulsive nonlinearities.

the properties of the radiating fireball and its environment as well as the
central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We report our optical observations
of GRB 111228A from 95 sec to about 50 hours after the burst trigger and
investigate its properties of the prompt gamma-rays and the ambient medium
using our data and the data observed with {\em Swift} and {\em Fermi} missions.
Our joint optical and X-ray spectral fits to the afterglow data show that the
ambient medium features as low dust-to-gas ratio. Incorporating the energy
injection effect, our best fit to the afterglow lightcurves with the standard
afterglow model via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique shows that
$\epsilon_e=(6.9\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-2}$, $\epsilon_B=(7.73\pm 0.62)\times
10^{-6}$, $E_{\rm K}=(6.32\pm 0.86)\times 10^{53}\rm erg$, $n=0.100\pm 0.014$

in a halo or in a hot ISM. Achromatic shallow decay segment observed in the
optical and X-ray bands is well explained with the long-lasting energy
injection from the central engine, which would be a magnetar with a period of
about 1.92 ms inferred from the data. The $E_p$ of its time-integrated prompt
gamma-ray spectrum is $\sim 26$ KeV. Using the initial Lorentz factor
($\Gamma_0=476^{+225}_{-237}$) derived from our afterglow model fit, it is
found that GRB 111228A satisfies the $L_{\rm iso}-E_{\rm p,z}-\Gamma_0$

share with the SFCs of the community in order to assist them storing
electricity, e.g., for fulfilling the demand of various shared facilities. To
this end, a modified auction-based mechanism is designed that captures the
interaction between the SFCs and the RUs so as to determine the auction price
and the allocation of ES shared by the RUs that governs the proposed joint ES
ownership. The fraction of the capacity of the storage that each RU decides to
put into the market to share with the SFCs and the auction price are determined
by a noncooperative Stackelberg game formulated between the RUs and the

via the unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) solution of the game. Numerical
experiments are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

$H(z)$ by an integral over $w(z)$. However, the usual observables are the
luminosity distances or the angular diameter distances, which measure the
distance-redshift relation. Actually, dark energy affects the distances (and
the growth factor) by a further integration over functions of $H(z)$. Thus, the
direct measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at different redshifts are
of great importance for constraining the properties of dark energy. In this
paper, we show how the typical dark energy models, for example, the
$\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, CPL, and holographic dark energy (HDE) models, can be
constrained by the current direct measurements of $H(z)$ (31 data in total,
covering the redshift range of $z\in [0.07,2.34]$). In fact, the future
redshift-drift observations (also referred to as the Sandage-Loeb test) can
also directly measure $H(z)$ at higher redshifts, covering the range of $z\in
[2,5]$. We thus discuss what role the redshift-drift observations can play in
constraining dark energy with the Hubble parameter measurements. We show that
the constraints on dark energy can be improved greatly with the $H(z)$ data
from only a 10-year observation of redshift drift.

necessary to introduce the product wave functions of the like-particle and
proton-neutron QRPA ground states, for achieving consistency between the
calculations of the true and virtual paths. Using these different paths, the
problem of whether or not these two methods give equivalent nuclear matrix

the two QRPA methods, i.e., the use of the product wave functions alone is not
sufficient. The author proposes introduction of the proton-neutron pairing

carries less many-body correlations without this supplemental interaction, for
obtaining the NME equivalent to that of the two-particle-transfer-path method.

linear inverse problems. We look at two variants of the basic problem, the
synthesis prior problem when the solution is sparse and the analysis prior
problem where the solution is cosparse in some linear basis. For the first
problem, we propose non linear variants of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
(OMP) and CoSamp algorithms; for the second problem we propose a non linear
variant of the Greedy Analysis Pursuit (GAP) algorithm. We empirically test the
success rates of our algorithms on exponential and logarithmic functions. We
model speckle denoising as a non linear sparse recovery problem and apply our
technique to solve it. Results show that our method outperforms state of the

structures and semi-classic transport coefficients of half-Heusler
$\mathrm{ANiB}$ (A=Ti, Hf, Sc, Y; B=Sn, Sb, Bi) by using generalized gradient
approximation (GGA). Calculated results show that SOC splits the valence bands
at high symmetry $\Gamma$ point, and modifies the outline of $\Gamma$-centered
valence bands, which has remarkable effects on the electron transport
properties. Thermoelectric properties are performed through solving Boltzmann
transport equations within the constant scattering time approximation. It is
found that the compounds containing Sn atom have larger power factor in p-type
doping than ones in n-type doping, and it is just the opposite for compounds
containing Sb and Bi elements. The SOC has obvious detrimental influence on
power factor in p-type doping, while has a negligible effect in n-type doping.
These can be understood by considering the effects of SOC on the valence bands
and conduction bands. The maximum power factors (MPF) are extracted in n-type
and p-type doping with GGA and GGA+SOC, and the MPF at 300 K with SOC is
predicted to be about 4.25\%$\sim$44.13\% smaller than that without SOC in the
case of p-type doping for $\mathrm{ANiB}$ (A=Ti, Hf, Sc, Y; B=Sn, Sb, Bi).
Therefore, it is crucial to consider SOC effects for theoretical analysis in
the case of p-type doping in half-Heusler compounds composed of heavy elements.

estimate the maps resulting in prolonged (clinically infeasible) acquisition

recovery technique. Estimating the T1 map requires solving an analysis prior
sparse recovery problem from non linear measurements, since the relationship
between T1 values and intensity values or K space samples is not linear. For
the first time in this work, we propose an algorithm for analysis prior sparse
recovery for non linear measurements. We have compared our approach with the

Jones","Multivariate Output Analysis for Markov chain Monte Carlo",,,,,"math.ST stat.CO stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) produces a correlated sample for estimating
expectations with respect to a target distribution. A fundamental question is
when should sampling stop so that we have good estimates of the desired
quantities? The key to answering this question lies in assessing the Monte
Carlo error through a multivariate Markov chain central limit theorem (CLT).
The multivariate nature of this Monte Carlo error largely has been ignored in
the MCMC literature. We present a multivariate framework for terminating
simulation in MCMC. We define a multivariate effective sample size, estimating
which requires strongly consistent estimators of the covariance matrix in the
Markov chain CLT; a property we show for the multivariate batch means
estimator. We then provide a lower bound on the number of minimum effective
samples required for a desired level of precision. This lower bound depends on
the problem only in the dimension of the expectation being estimated, and not
on the underlying stochastic process. This result is obtained by drawing a
connection between terminating simulation via effective sample size and
terminating simulation using a relative standard deviation fixed-volume
sequential stopping rule; which we demonstrate is an asymptotically valid
procedure. The finite sample properties of the proposed method are demonstrated
in a variety of examples.

(MCA), in which a real heterogeneous material is an ensemble of interacting
elements of finite size - automata, is used. It is supposed to be that the
motion of each automata can be described by Newton's Second law. The force
acting on the i-th automata consists of the following components:
volume-dependent force acting on the automata i which is caused by pressure
from the surrounding automata; force of an external magnetic field acting on
the i-th automata with some magnetic moment; and normal and tangential
interaction force between a pair of i and j automata. This approach was used

G-CNN with around 180 boxes in a multi-scale grid performs comparably to Fast
R-CNN which uses around 2K bounding boxes generated with a proposal technique.
This strategy makes detection faster by removing the object proposal stage as
well as reducing the number of boxes to be processed.

in many knowledge-based applications. To further increase the number of facts
in RDF knowledge bases, logic rules can be used to predict new facts based on
the existing ones. Therefore, how to automatically learn reliable rules from

propose a novel rule learning approach named RDF2Rules for RDF knowledge bases.
RDF2Rules first mines frequent predicate cycles (FPCs), a kind of interesting
frequent patterns in knowledge bases, and then generates rules from the mined
FPCs. Because each FPC can produce multiple rules, and effective pruning
strategy is used in the process of mining FPCs, RDF2Rules works very
efficiently. Another advantage of RDF2Rules is that it uses the entity type
information when generates and evaluates rules, which makes the learned rules
more accurate. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the compared

collaborate to compute a function of their private data without revealing any

information theoretically secure MPC is possible among $n$ users (connected by

collusion of less than $n/2$ users in the honest-but-curious model, relatively
less is known about the communication and randomness complexity of secure

  In this work, we employ information theoretic techniques to obtain lower
bounds on the amount of communication and randomness required for secure MPC.
We restrict ourselves to a concrete interactive setting involving 3 users under
which all functions are securely computable against corruption of a single user
in the honest-but-curious model. We derive lower bounds for both the perfect
security case (i.e., zero-error and no leakage of information) and asymptotic
security (where the probability of error and information leakage vanish as
block-length goes to $\infty$).

common information), a new information inequality for 3-user protocols, and the
idea of distribution switching. Our lower bounds are shown to be tight for
various functions of interest. In particular, we show concrete functions which
have ""communication-ideal"" protocols, i.e., which achieve the minimum
communication simultaneously on all links in the network, and also use minimum

to here as the gauged generalized Shirafuji (GGS) action, that consists of
twistor variables, auxiliary variables, and $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ gauge fields on
the one-dimensional parameter space of a particle's worldline. The GGS action
remains invariant under reparametrization and the local $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$
transformations of the relevant variables, although the $SU(2)$ symmetry is
nonlinearly realized. We consider the canonical Hamiltonian formalism based on
the GGS action in the unitary gauge by following Dirac's recipe for constrained
Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that just sufficient constraints for the
twistor variables are consistently derived by virtue of the gauge symmetries of
the GGS action. In the subsequent quantization procedure, these constraints
turn into simultaneous differential equations for a twistor function. We
perform the Penrose transform of this twistor function to define a massive
spinor field of arbitrary rank, demonstrating that the spinor field satisfies
generalized Dirac-Fierz-Pauli equations with $SU(2)$ indices. We also

classification of circulant graphs in terms of $S$-rings and results in
exhaustive listing (with the use of COCO and GAP) of all corresponding
$S$-rings of the indicated orders. The latter method is conducted in the
framework of a general approach developed earlier for counting circulant graphs
of prime-power orders. It is a Redfield--P\'olya type of enumeration based on
an isomorphism criterion for circulant graphs of such orders. In particular,
five intermediate enumeration subproblems arise, which are refined further into
eleven subproblems of this type (5 and 11 are, not accidentally, the 3d Catalan
and 3d little Schr\""oder numbers, resp.). All of them are resolved for the four
cases under consideration (again with the use of GAP). We give a brief survey
of some background theory of the results which form the basis of our
computational approach.

numerical results obtained here are new. In particular the number (up to
isomorphism) of directed circulant graphs of orders 27, regardless of valency,
is shown to be equal to 3,728,891 while 457 of these are self-complementary.
Some curious and rather unexpected identities are established between
intermediate valency-specified enumerators (both for undirected and directed
circulant graphs) and their validity is conjectured for arbitrary cubed odd
prime $p^3$.
  We believe that this research can serve as the crucial step towards explicit
uniform enumeration formulae for circulant graphs of orders $p^3$ for arbitrary

performance to the corresponding score (a.k.a. score following) which can
handle tempo changes, errors and arbitrary repeats and/or skips (repeats/skips)
in performances. This type of score following is particularly useful in
automatic accompaniment for practices and rehearsals, where errors and
repeats/skips are often made. Simple extensions of the algorithms previously
proposed in the literature are not applicable in these situations for scores of
practical length due to the problem of large computational complexity. To cope
with this problem, we present two hidden Markov models of monophonic
performance with errors and arbitrary repeats/skips, and derive efficient
score-following algorithms with an assumption that the prior probability
distributions of score positions before and after repeats/skips are independent
from each other. We confirmed real-time operation of the algorithms with music
scores of practical length (around 10000 notes) on a modern laptop and their
tracking ability to the input performance within 0.7 s on average after
repeats/skips in clarinet performance data. Further improvements and extension
for polyphonic signals are also discussed.

the quasi totality of a closed flow, the mean flow influences their behaviour
and also biases the velocity time statistics, in particular the velocity
correlation functions. By using a method that allows for the computation of
turbulent velocity trajectories, we can obtain unbiased Lagrangian integral
time. This is particularly useful in accessing the scale separation for such

  Content-Centric Networking","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a recent paradigm that claims to
mitigate some limitations of the current IP-based Internet architecture. The
centerpiece of ICN is named and addressable content, rather than hosts or
interfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a prominent ICN instance that
shares the fundamental architectural design with its equally popular academic
sibling Named-Data Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates
one-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an interest). As an
interest is forwarded it creates state in intervening routers and the requested
content back is delivered over the reverse path using that state.
  Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms of
efficiency, and resilience to certain types of attacks, this has not been
decisively proven via realistic experiments. Since keeping per-interest state
complicates router operations and makes the infrastructure susceptible to
router state exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense
against interest flooding attacks), the value of the stateful forwarding plane
in CCN should be re-examined.
  In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems of the
stateful forwarding plane. We then argue that its benefits are uncertain at
best and it should not be a mandatory CCN feature. To this end, we propose a
new stateless architecture for CCN that provides nearly all functionality of
the stateful design without its headaches. We analyze performance and resource
requirements of the proposed architecture, via experiments.

C18O (2-1) observations toward the Class 0/I protostar L1455 IRS1 in Perseus.
The IRAM results show L1455 IRS1 located in a dense core of 0.05 pc in size
with a mass of 0.54M_sun, connecting to a filamentary structure. Inside the
dense core, compact components of 350 AU and 1500 AU are detected in the SMA
1.3 mm continuum and C18O, with a velocity gradient in the latter one
perpendicular to a bipolar outflow in 12CO, likely tracing a rotational motion.
We measure a rotational velocity profile ~ r^-0.75 that becomes shallower at a
turning radius of ~200 AU which is approximately the radius of the 1.3 mm
continuum component. These results hint the presence of a Keplerian disk with a
radius <200 AU around L1455 IRS1 with a protostellar mass of about 0.28 M_sun.
We derive a core rotation that is about one order of magnitude faster than
expected. A significant velocity gradient along a filament towards IRS1
indicates that this filament is dynamically important, providing a gas
reservoir and possibly responsible for the faster-than-average core rotation.
Previous polarimetric observations show a magnetic field aligned with the
outflow axis and perpendicular to the associated filament on a 0.1~pc scale,
while on the inner 1000 AU scale, the field becomes perpendicular to the
outflow axis.This change in magnetic field orientations is consistent with our
estimated increase in rotational energy from large to small scales that
overcomes the magnetic field energy, wrapping the field lines and aligning them
with the disk velocity gradient. These results are discussed in the context of
the interplay between filament, magnetic field, and gas kinematics from large
to small scale. Possible emerging trends are explored with a sample of 8 Class
0/I protostars.

are less and less sensitive to flow fluctuations as their size increases, we
observe the emergence of a slow dynamics corresponding to back-and-forth
motions between two attractors, and a super-slow regime synchronized with flow
reversals when they exist. Such dynamics is substantially reproduced by a one
dimensional stochastic model of an over-damped particle trapped in a two-well
potential, forced by a colored noise. An extended model is also proposed that
reproduces observed dynamics and trapping without potential barrier: the key

the Standard Model with one Higgs doublet, matching to the supersymmetric UV
completion is possible if the low-scale model contains two Higgs doublets. In
this case vacuum stability and experimental constraints point towards low

higgsino superpartners of the Higgs fields are also kept light, the conclusions
are similar and essentially independent of the higgsino mass. Finally, if all
gauginos are also given electroweak-scale masses (split supersymmetry with two
Higgs doublets), the model cannot be matched to supersymmetry at very high
scales when requiring a 125 GeV Higgs. Light neutral and charged higgsinos
therefore emerge as a promising signature of a supersymmetric UV completion of

While Web services traditionally mimic remote procedure calling interfaces, a
new generation of so-called hypermedia APIs works through hyperlinks and forms,
in a way similar to how people browse the Web. This means that existing
composition techniques, which determine a procedural plan upfront, are not
sufficient to consume hypermedia APIs, which need to be navigated at runtime.
Clients instead need a more dynamic plan that allows them to follow hyperlinks
and use forms with a preset goal. Therefore, in this article, we show how
compositions of hypermedia APIs can be created by generic Semantic Web
reasoners. This is achieved through the generation of a proof based on semantic
descriptions of the APIs' functionality. To pragmatically verify the
applicability of compositions, we introduce the notion of pre-execution and
post-execution proofs. The runtime interaction between a client and a server is
guided by proofs but driven by hypermedia, allowing the client to react to the
application's actual state indicated by the server's response. We describe how
to generate compositions from descriptions, discuss a computer-assisted process
to generate descriptions, and verify reasoner performance on various
composition tasks using a benchmark suite. The experimental results lead to the
conclusion that proof-based consumption of hypermedia APIs is a feasible
strategy at Web scale.

the universe as scalar field $\phi$ oscillates quickly around some point where
$V(\phi)$ has a minimum. The end of this stage has an important role on the
further evolution stages of the universe. The created particles are responsible
for reheating the universe at the end of this stage. The behaviour of the
inflation and reheating stages are often known as power law expansion $S(\eta)
\varpropto \eta^{1+\beta}$, $S(\eta) \varpropto \eta^{1+\beta_{s}}$
respectively. The reheating temperature ($T_{rh}$) and $\beta_{s}$ give us
valuable information about the reheating stage. Recently people have studied
about the behaviour of $T_{rh}$ based on slow-roll inflation and initial
condition of quantum normalization. It is shown that there is some discrepancy
on $T_{rh}$ due to amount of $\beta_{s}$ under the condition of slow-roll
inflation and quantum normalization \cite{acq}. Therefore the author is
believed in \cite{acq} that the quantum normalization may not be a good initial
condition. But it seems that we can remove this discrepancy by determining the
appropriate parameter $\beta_{s}$ and hence the obtained temperatures based on
the calculated $\beta_{s}$ are in favour of both mentioned conditions. Then
from given $\beta_{s}$, we can calculate $T_{rh}$, tensor to scalar ratio $r$
and parameters $\beta, n$ based on the Planck and WMAP-9 data. The observed
results of $r, \beta_{s}, \beta$ and $n$ have consistency with their
constrains. Also the results of $T_{rh}$ are in agreement with its general
range and special range based on the DECIGO and BBO detectors.

proofs, as a tool for the design of self-stabilizing algorithms.In particular,
it introduces a somewhat generalized notion of distributed local proofs, and
utilizes it for improving the time complexity significantly, while maintaining
space optimality. As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries
at most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient
for both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts
that may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the
notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency.
This adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been
gaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof
labeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\log n)$ bits per node), and
whose time complexity is $O(\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\Delta
\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of
nodes. This answers an open problem posed by Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991).
We also show that $\Omega(\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous
networks. Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the
requireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\log
n)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known
transformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes
as input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing
proof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm.
When used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing
algorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even
than that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST
algorithms that used $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and
the time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof
labelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the
following two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended,
then they are detected by some nodes within $O(\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous
networks, or within $O(\Delta \log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if
$f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are
detected within the $O(f\log n)$ locality of each of the faults. We also show
how to improve the above two properties, at the expense of some increase in the
memory.

micro-structure. In the absence of a soft matrix, a linear beam lattice model
is formulated to describe the free dynamic response of the periodic cell. After
a static condensation of the passive degrees-of-freedom, a general procedure is
applied to impose the quasi-periodicity conditions of free wave propagation in

different mechanical parameters on the band structure are analyzed by comparing
the exact dispersion curves with explicit, although approximate, dispersion
functions, obtained from asymptotic perturbation solutions of the eigenproblem

  Paradigm, IOPS, and Small Data",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is an efficient way to improve the
performance of traditional client-server systems. Currently, there are two main
design paradigms for RDMA-accelerated systems. The first allows the clients to
directly operate the server's memory and totally bypasses the CPUs at server
side. The second follows the traditional server-reply paradigm, which asks the
server to write results back to the clients. However, the first method has to
expose server's memory and needs tremendous re-design of upper-layer software,
which is complex, unsafe, error-prone, and inefficient. The second cannot
achieve high input/output operations per second (IOPS), because it employs
out-bound RDMA-write at server side which is not efficient.
  We find that the performance of out-bound RDMA-write and in-bound RDMA-read
is asymmetric and the latter is 5 times faster than the former. Based on this
observation, we propose a novel design paradigm named Remote Fetching Paradigm
(RFP). In RFP, the server is still responsible for processing requests from the
clients. However, counter-intuitively, instead of sending results back to the
clients through out-bound RDMA-write, the server only writes the results in
local memory buffers, and the clients use in-bound RDMA-read to remotely fetch
these results. Since in-bound RDMA-read achieves much higher IOPS than
out-bound RDMA-write, our model is able to bring higher performance than the
traditional models.
  In order to prove the effectiveness of RFP, we design and implement an
RDMA-accelerated in-memory key-value store following the RFP model. To further
improve the IOPS, we propose an optimization mechanism that combines status
checking and result fetching. Experiment results show that RFP can improve the
IOPS by 160%~310% against state-of-the-art models for in-memory key-value

measured densities were found to be above LogN_e = 11. We have modeled that EUV
jet as a vertically moving magnetic flux tube (untwisted and weakly twisted)
and have studied the propagation characteristics of the kink (m = 1) mode and
the higher m modes with azimuthal mode numbers m = 2, 3, 4. It turns out that
all these MHD waves can become unstable at flow velocities in the range of
112--114.8 km/s. The lowest critical jet velocity of 112 km/s is obtained when
modeling the jet as compressible plasma contained in an untwisted magnetic flux
tube. We have compared two analytically found criteria for predicting the
threshold Alfven Mach number for the onset of KH instability and have concluded
that one of them yields reliable values for the critical Alfven Mach number.
Our study of the nature of stable and unstable MHD modes propagating on the jet
shows that in a stable regime all the modes are pure surface waves, while the
unstable kink (m = 1) mode in untwisted compressible plasma flux tube becomes a
leaky wave. In the limit of incompressible media (for the jet and its
environment) all unstable modes are non-leaky surface waves.

that have been widely used in computer vision. However, by restricting the
order of the potentials to be at most two, they fail to capture useful image
statistics. We propose a natural generalization of TCM to high-order random
fields, which we call truncated max-of-convex models (TMCM). The energy
function of TMCM consistsof two types of potentials: (i) unary potential, which
has no restriction on its form; and (ii) clique potential, which is the sum of
the m largest truncated convex distances over all label pairs in a clique. The
use of a convex distance function encourages smoothness, while truncation
allows for discontinuities in the labeling. By using m > 1, TMCM provides
robustness towards errors in the definition of the cliques. In order to
minimize the energy function of a TMCM over all possible labelings, we design
an efficient st-MINCUT based range expansion algorithm. We prove the accuracy
of our algorithm by establishing strong multiplicative bounds for several
special cases of interest. Using synthetic and standard real data sets, we
demonstrate the benefit of our high-order TMCM over pairwise TCM, as well as

this method to investigate metallic gratings and find nearly degenerate
plasmons at the interface between metal and amorphous silicon (a-Si). The
plasmons cause large undesired absorption in the metal part of a grating as
used in a-Si cells. We explore ways to alleviate the parasitic absorption in
the metal by appropriate choice of the geometry. Separating the diffraction
grating from the back reflector helps, lining silver or aluminum with a
dielectric helps as well. Gratings with depth > 60nm are preferred, and periods
> 600nm are not useful. Maximum absorption in silicon can occur for less thick
a-Si than is standard. We also find that geometric asymmetry can improve the
absorption for PV. Lastly, we investigate the modal contributions to
absorption, and find that for the most part, the absorption can not be
attributed to single modes, but comes from the interplay of a few important
modes.

relaxation time relax, which is the time it takes to return to equilibrium

frequently necessary, and is often obtained by a complex feedback process. To
overcome the limitations of such an approach, alternative methods based on
driving have been recently demonstrated [2, 3], for isolated quantum and
classical systems [4--9]. Their extension to open systems in contact with a
thermostat is a stumbling block for applications. Here, we design a
protocol,named Engineered Swift Equilibration (ESE), that shortcuts
time-consuming relaxations, and we apply it to a Brownian particle trapped in
an optical potential whose properties can be controlled in time. We implement
the process experimentally, showing that it allows the system to reach

the increase of the dissipated energy needed to get such a time reduction. The
method paves the way for applications in micro and nano devices, where the
reduction of operation time represents as substantial a challenge as
miniaturization [10]. The concepts of equilibrium and of transformations from
an equilibrium state to another, are cornerstones of thermodynamics. A textbook
illustration is provided by the expansion of a gas, starting at equilibrium and
expanding to reach a new equilibrium in a larger vessel. This operation can be
performed either very slowly by a piston, without dissipating energy into the

the focus has been centered around uni- and biaxial nematics associated with
constituents bearing a $D_{\infty h}$ or $D_{2h}$ symmetry respectively. In
view of general symmetries, however, these are singularly special since nematic
order can in principle involve any point group symmetry. Given the progress in
tailoring nano particles with particular shapes and interactions, this vast
family of ""generalized nematics"" might become accessible in the laboratory.
Little is known since the order parameter theories associated with the highly
symmetric point groups are remarkably complicated, involving tensor order
parameters of high rank. Here we show that the generic features of the
statistical physics of such systems can be studied in a highly flexible and
efficient fashion using a mathematical tool borrowed from high energy physics:
discrete non-Abelian gauge theory. Explicitly, we construct a family of lattice
gauge models encapsulating nematic ordering of general three dimensional point
group symmetries. We find that the most symmetrical ""generalized nematics"" are
subjected to thermal fluctuations of unprecedented severity. As a result, novel
forms of fluctuation phenomena become possible. In particular, we demonstrate
that a vestigial phase carrying no more than chiral order becomes ubiquitous
departing from high point group symmetry chiral building blocks, such as $I$,

develop a theory for the electric transport in this system based on the

an effective field theoretical description of the low-energy excitations,

edge mode coupled to charge-neutral spin-wave excitations in the 2D bulk.
Focusing particularly on the FM phase, naively expected to exhibit perfect
conductance, we study a mechanism whereby the coupling to these bulk

conductance as a function of temperature and the Zeeman energy - the parameter
that tunes the transition between the FM and CAF phases - with behavior in

about the formation and evolution of groups in the context of social messaging

the diffusion processes by which they develop new members. In this paper, we
analyze the daily usage logs from WeChat group messaging platform - the largest
standalone messaging communication service in China - with the goal of
understanding the processes by which social messaging groups come together,
grow new members, and evolve over time. Specifically, we discover a strong
dichotomy among groups in terms of their lifecycle, and develop a separability
model by taking into account a broad range of group-level features, showing
that long-term and short-term groups are inherently distinct. We also found
that the lifecycle of messaging groups is largely dependent on their social
roles and functions in users' daily social experiences and specific purposes.
Given the strong separability between the long-term and short-term groups, we
further address the problem concerning the early prediction of successful
communities. In addition to modeling the growth and evolution from group-level
perspective, we investigate the individual-level attributes of group members
and study the diffusion process by which groups gain new members. By
considering members' historical engagement behavior as well as the local social
network structure that they embedded in, we develop a membership cascade model

($A(e,e'NN)$ in brief) is considered to be a primary source of information
about short-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei. For a proper interpretation of
the data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.
  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive
$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass
region. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role
of FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a ""small"" and
""large"" coverage of the available phase space.
  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive
$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on ""free"" nucleon pairs, drops
from $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb. For all considered
kinematics, the mass dependence of the $T^{pN}_{A}$ can be captured by the
power law $T^{pN}_{A} \propto A^{- \lambda}$ with $ 0.4 \lesssim \lambda
\lesssim 0.5 $. Apart from an overall reduction factor, we find that FSI only
modestly affects the distinct features of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ which are
dictated by the c.m. distribution of close-proximity pairs.
  Conclusion: The SCX mechanisms represent a relatively small (order of a few
percent) contribution of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ processes. The mass dependence
of FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ can be captured in a robust power law
and is in agreement with the predictions obtained in a toy model.

concisely summarize key information about the partitioning of electrons among
atoms in materials. Although widely used, there is currently no atomic
population analysis method suitable for being used as a default method in
quantum chemistry programs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
atoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties: (1) exactly one
electron distribution is assigned to each atom, (2) core electrons are assigned
to the correct host atom, (3) NACs are formally independent of the basis set
type because they are functionals of the total electron distribution, (4) the
assigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging
polyatomic multipole expansion, (5) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling
scale electronegativity trends, (6) NACs for a particular element have good
transferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded, (7)
the assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin
moments, (8) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a
unique solution, and (9) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales
linearly with increasing system size. Across a broad range of material types,
the DDEC6 NACs reproduced electron transfer trends, core electron binding
energy shift trends, and electrostatic potentials across multiple system

methods. Due to non-nuclear attractors, Bader's quantum chemical topology could
not assign NACs for some of these materials. The DDEC6 method alleviates the
bifurcation or runaway charges problem exhibited by earlier DDEC variants and
the Iterative Hirshfeld method. These characteristics make the DDEC6 method
ideally suited for use as a default charge assignment method in quantum
chemistry programs.

  Interactions in the Internet of Things",,,,,"cs.CY cs.DB cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With recent advances in radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless
sensor networks, and Web services, physical things are becoming an integral
part of the emerging ubiquitous Web. Finding correlations of ubiquitous things
is a crucial prerequisite for many important applications such as things
search, discovery, classification, recommendation, and composition. This
article presents DisCor-T, a novel graph-based method for discovering
underlying connections of things via mining the rich content embodied in
human-thing interactions in terms of user, temporal and spatial information. We
model these various information using two graphs, namely spatio-temporal graph
and social graph. Then, random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to find
proximities among things, and a relational graph of things (RGT) indicating
implicit correlations of things is learned. The correlation analysis lays a
solid foundation contributing to improved effectiveness in things management.
To demonstrate the utility, we develop a flexible feature-based classification
framework on top of RGT and perform a systematic case study. Our evaluation
exhibits the strength and feasibility of the proposed approach.

the United States, different choices of observations and metrics have often
produced diametrically opposite insights. This paper focuses on understanding
and characterizing meteorological droughts from station measurements of
precipitation. The Standardized Precipitation Index is computed and analyzed to
obtain drought severity, duration and frequency. Average drought severity
trends are found to be uncertain and data-dependent. Furthermore, the mean and
spatial variance do not show any discernible non-stationary behavior. However,
the spatial coverage of extreme meteorological droughts in the United States
exhibits an increasing trend over nearly all of the last century. Furthermore,
the coverage over the last half decade exceeds that of the dust bowl era.
Previous literature suggests that climate extremes do not necessarily follow
the trends or uncertainties exhibited by the averages. While this possibility
has been suggested for droughts, this paper for the first time clearly
delineates and differentiates the trends in the mean, variability and extremes
of meteorological droughts in the United States, and uncovers the trends in the
spatial coverage of extremes. Multiple data sets, as well as years exhibiting
large, and possibly anomalous, droughts are carefully examined to characterize
trends and uncertainties. Nonlinear dependence among meteorological drought
attributes necessitates the use of copula-based tools from probability theory.
Severity-duration-frequency curves are generated to demonstrate how these
insights may be translated to design and policy.

the data. In many cases, these measurements translate into new insights which
are not available by other means. To compute homology, we rely on mathematical
constructions which scale exponentially with the size of the data. Therefore,
for large point clouds, the computation is infeasible using classical
computers. In this paper, we present a quantum annealing pipeline for
computation of homology of large point clouds. The pipeline takes as input a
graph approximating the given point cloud. It uses quantum annealing to compute
a clique covering of the graph and then uses this cover to construct a
Mayer-Vietoris complex. The pipeline terminates by performing a simplified
homology computation of the Mayer-Vietoris complex. We have introduced three
different clique coverings and their quantum annealing formulation. Our
pipeline scales polynomially in the size of the data, once the covering step is
solved. To prove correctness of our algorithm, we have also included tests
using D-Wave 2X quantum processor.

temperature product and free energy product for both event horizon and Cauchy
horizon. Our motive is to check whether the same quantity for event horizon and

stability of such black hole by computing the specific heat and free energy for
both the horizons. All these calculation might be helpful to understand the

at ambient temperature was measured by inelastic x-ray scattering from ambient
pressure up to pressures well beyond that of the known $\alpha$-quartz to
rutile polyamorphic (PA) transition. We observe significant differences in the
spectral shape measured below and above the PA transition, in particular, in
the 30-80 meV range. Guided by first-principle lattice dynamics calculations,
we interpret the changes in the phonon dispersion as the evolution from a
quartz-like to a rutile-like coordination. Notably, such a crossover is
accompanied by a cusp-like behavior in the pressure dependence of the elastic
response of the system. Overall, the presented results highlight the complex
fingerprint of PA phenomena on the high-frequency phonon dispersion.
