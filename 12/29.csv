model with bit creation operators carrying only transverse spinor indices
a=1,...,s. At leading order (1/N=0), this model produces a (discretized)
lightcone string with a ""transverse space' of $s$ Grassmann worldsheet fields.
Higher orders in the 1/N expansion are shown to be determined by the overlap of
a single large closed chain (discretized string) with two smaller closed
chains. In the models studied here, the overlap is not accompanied with
operator insertions at the break/join point. Then the requirement that the
discretized overlap have a smooth continuum limit leads to the critical
Grassmann ""dimension"" of s=24. This ""protostring"", a Grassmann analog of the
bosonic string, is unusual, because it has no large transverse dimensions. It
is a string moving in one space dimension and there are neither tachyons nor
massless particles. The protostring, derived from our pure spinor string bit
model, has 24 Grassmann dimensions, 16 of which could be bosonized to form 8
compactified bosonic dimensions, leaving 8 Grassmann dimensions--the worldsheet
content of the superstring. If the transverse space of the protostring could be
""decompactified"", string bit models might provide an appealing and solid
foundation for superstring theory.

cryptographic systems, key recovery cryptanalysis techniques for linear code
based cryptographic systems are generally scheme specific. In recent years,
several important techniques such as Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack, filtration

relatively new, they prove to be very powerful and many systems have been
broken using them. Thus it is important to design linear code based

proposes linear code based encryption scheme RLCE which shares many
characteristics with random linear codes. Our analysis shows that the scheme
RLCE is secure against existing attacks and we hope that the security of the
RLCE scheme is equivalent to the hardness of decoding random linear codes.

That is, how to predict when and which users are activated at any time point of

separation of timescales exists between the dynamics of the modules and that of
the macro system, below which it behaves approximately as the stable sum of its

propose a caching strategy, namely Q-caching, which leverages information that

pathways, demonstration of this expectation has been difficult to establish in

obtained in single molecule pulling experiments on src SH3 domain, exhibits
upward curvature on a $\log k_\mathrm{u}(f)$ plot. Similar observations were
reported for other proteins for the unfolding rate $k_\mathrm{u}([C])$. These
findings imply unfolding in these single domain proteins involves a switch in
the pathway as $f$ or $[C]$ is increased from a low to a high value. We provide
a unified theory demonstrating that if $\log k_\mathrm{u}$ as a function of a
perturbation ($f$ or $[C]$) exhibits upward curvature then the underlying
energy landscape must be strongly multidimensional. Using molecular simulations
we provide a structural basis for the switch in the pathways and dramatic
shifts in the transition state ensemble (TSE) in src SH3 domain as $f$ is
increased. We show that a single point mutation shifts the upward curvature in
$\log k_\mathrm{u}(f)$ to a lower force, thus establishing the malleability of
the underlying folding landscape. Our theory, applicable to any perturbation
that affects the free energy of the protein linearly, readily explains movement
in the TSE in a $\beta$-sandwich (I27) protein and single chain monellin as the
denaturant concentration is varied. We predict that in the force range
accessible in laser optical tweezer experiments there should be a switch in the

for random graphs G: what radius R ensures that G can be uniquely recovered
from its list of rooted R-neighborhoods, with high probability? Here we
consider this question for random regular graphs of fixed degree d (at least
three). A result of Bollobas (1982) implies efficient recovery at
$R=((1+\epsilon)\log n)/(2\log(d-1))$ with high probability --- moreover, this
recovery algorithm uses only a summary of the distances in each neighborhood.
We show that using the full neighborhood structure gives a sharper bound $R =
(\log n + \log\log n)/(2\log(d-1))+ O(1)$, which we prove is tight up to the
O(1) term. One consequence of our proof is that if G,H are independent graphs
where G follows the random regular law, then with high probability the graphs
are non-isomorphic; and this can be efficiently certified by testing the
R-neighborhood list of H against the R-neighborhood of a single adversarially
chosen vertex of G.

which are supplied by different sensors become incomprehensible. For better
visual perception of these images, it is essential to operate series of

processing steps for more precise analysis on the images. There are several
approaches for processing which are depended on the type of remote sensing
images. The discussed approach in this article, i.e. image fusion, is the use
of natural colors of an optical image for adding color to a grayscale satellite
image which gives us the ability for better observation of the HR image of OLI
sensor of Landsat-8. This process with emphasis on details of fusion technique
has previously been performed; however, we are going to apply the concept of
the interpolation process. In fact, we see many important software tools such
as ENVI and ERDAS as the most famous remote sensing image processing tools have
only classical interpolation techniques (such as bi-linear (BL) and
bi-cubic/cubic convolution (CC)). Therefore, ENVI- and ERDAS-based researches
in image fusion area and even other fusion researches often dont use new and
better interpolators and are mainly concentrated on the fusion algorithms
details for achieving a better quality, so we only focus on the interpolation
impact on fusion quality in Landsat-8 multispectral images. The important
feature of this approach is to use a statistical, adaptive, and edge-guided
interpolation method for improving the color quality in the images in practice.
Numerical simulations show selecting the suitable interpolation techniques in
MRF-based images creates better quality than the classical interpolators.

as much matter as antimatter on large scales and presents a local baryon
asymmetry. A key ingredient in our approach is that the baryon density
distribution follows Gaussian fluctuations around a null value $\eta = 0$.
Spatial domains featuring a positive (resp. negative) baryonic density value
constitute regions dominated by matter (resp. antimatter). At the domains'
annihilation interface, the typical density is going smoothly to zero, rather
than following an abrupt step as assumed in previous symetric matter-antimatter
models. As a consequence, the Cosmic Diffuse Gamma Background produced by
annihilation is drastically reduced, allowing to easily pass COMPTEL's
measurements limits. Similarly the Compton $y$ distorsion and CMB 'ribbons' are
lowered by an appreciable factor. Therefore this model essentially escape
previous constrainst on symetric matter-antimatter models. However, we produce
an estimation of the CMB temperature fluctuations that would result from this
model and confront it to data acquired from the Planck satellite. We construct
a angular power spectrum in $\delta T / T_{CMB}$ assuming is can be
approximated as an average of $C_\ell$ over a Gaussian distribution of
$\Omega_B$ using Lewis & Challinor's CAMB software. The resulting $C_\ell$ are
qualitatively satisfying. We quantify the goodness of fit using a simple
$\chi^2$ test. We consider two distinct scenarios in which the fluctuations on
$\Omega_B$ are compensated by fluctuations on $\Omega_{CDM}$ to assure a
spatially flat $\Omega_\kappa = 0$ universe or not. In both cases, out best fit
have $\Delta \chi^2 \gtrsim 2400$ (with respect to a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM
model), empirically excluding our model by several tens of standard deviations.

angular momentum advection dominated flow in connection to certain supermassive
black holes at the centres of the galaxies (including our own) fed from a
number of stellar donors. Introduction of a weak viscosity, as a first order
linear correction involving the viscosity parameter, however, may sometimes
provide a more detail understanding of the observed black hole spectra. The
transonic behaviour of the stationary solutions have been studied for the
aforementioned quasi-viscous accretion for all possible geometric
configurations of axisymmetric flow. For a sufficiently low range of the
viscosity parameter, transonic solutions containing one or three critical
points have been found for allowed ranges in the astrophysical parameters under
the post-Newtonian pseudo-Schwarzschild scheme. With the introduction of such
viscosity parameter, the only feasible critical points are of saddle and spiral
types in contrary to the inviscid case where centre type points were formed
instead of spiral ones. Introduction of linear perturbations on stationary flow
solutions and their time evolution in both standing and radially propagating

shows that similar kind of secular instability exists in all the considered
disk models at large distance in the asymptotic limit, however, the model
itself is valid only within a certain length scale and the disks sustain within
that length scale only for at least a considerable time scale.

correlations between a di-photon excess and precision observables, including
the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of quarks and leptons,
neutral meson oscillations and radiative flavor changing neutral current

height relationships. Numerical simulations are performed using 2D thin-film
approximation of the device structures at various Schottky barrier heights.
Without any adjustable parameters and only assuming low p-doping of the
transistor channel, the modelled data show exceptionally good correlation with
the measured data. From both experimental and simulation results, it is
concluded that source-barrier controlled nanowire transistors have excellent
potential advantages compared with a standard FET including mitigation of
short-channel effects, insensitivity in device operating currents to device
channel length variation, higher on/off ratios, higher gain, lower power
consumption and higher operational speed for solution processable and printable
nanowire electronics.

as sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. We take into account the jet
propagation physics both inside the progenitor star and the surrounding dense
medium. Radiation constraints, which are relevant for high-energy neutrino
production are considered as well. Efficient shock acceleration of cosmic rays
is possible for sufficiently low-power jets and/or jets buried in a dense,
extended wind or outer envelope. Such conditions also favor GRB jets to become
stalled, and the necessary conditions for stalling are explicitly derived. Such
choked jets may explain transrelativistic supernovae (SNe) and low-luminosity
(LL) GRBs, giving a unified picture of GRBs and GRB-SNe. Focusing on this
unified scenario for GRBs, we calculate the resulting neutrino spectra from
choked jets including the relevant microphysical processes such as multipion
production in pp and pgamma interactions, as well as the energy losses of
mesons and muons. We obtain diffuse neutrino spectra using the latest results
for the luminosity function of LL GRBs. Although uncertainties are large, we
confirm that LL GRBs can potentially give a significant contribution to the
diffuse neutrino flux. Our results are consistent with the present IceCube data
and do not violate the stacking limits on classical high-luminosity GRBs. We
find that high-energy neutrino production in choked jets is dominated by pgamma
interactions. These sources are dark in GeV-TeV gamma-rays, and do not
contribute significantly to the Fermi diffuse gamma-ray background. Assuming
stalled jets can launch a quasi-spherical shock in the dense medium, precursor
TeV neutrinos emerging prior to the shock breakout gamma-ray emission can be
used as smoking gun evidence for a choked jet model for LL GRBs. Our results
strengthen the relevance of wide field-of-view sky monitors.

well-fitted by a combination of a Navarro, Frenk & White(NFW) density profile

satellite distribution of red hosts exceeds r_s for the satellite distribution
of blue hosts. In both cases the dependence of r_s on host stellar mass is
well-fitted by a power law. For the satellites of red hosts, r_s^{red} \propto
(M_\ast / M_\sun)^{0.71 \pm 0.05} while for the satellites of blue hosts,
r_s^{blue} \propto (M_\ast / M_\sun)^{0.48 \pm 0.07}$. For hosts with stellar
masses greater than 4.0E+10 M_sun, the satellite distribution around blue hosts
is more concentrated than is the satellite distribution around red hosts. The

halos; however, the spatial distribution of the satellites of blue hosts is

methodology is general and applies to any analysis of satellites in a mock

learning and data mining. The crucial limitation of those models,however, is
the scalability. The Bayesian Network, which is one of the most common PGMs
used in machine learning and data mining, demonstrates this limitation when the
training data consists of random variables, each of them has a large set of
possible values. In the big data era, one would expect new extensions to the
existing PGMs to handle the massive amount of data produced these days by
computers, sensors and other electronic devices. With hierarchical data - data
that is arranged in a treelike structure with several levels - one would expect
to see hundreds of thousands or millions of values distributed over even just a
small number of levels. When modeling this kind of hierarchical data across
large data sets, Bayesian Networks become infeasible for representing the
probability distributions. In this paper we introduce an extension to Bayesian
Networks to handle massive sets of hierarchical data in a reasonable amount of
time and space. The proposed model achieves perfect precision of 1.0 and high
recall of 0.93 when it is used as multi-label classifier for the annotation of

avoid collisions. Most important, we solve a complex optimization problem by
means of the Particle Swarm Optimization method in order to exploit the
so-called Braess's paradox. More precisely, we reduce the evacuation time from
a room by adding in the walking area multiple obstacles optimally placed and
shaped.

construction and characterisation of Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD),
with particular attention to the realisation of the largest triple (Gas
electron Multiplier) GEM chambers so far operated, the GE1/1 chambers of the
CMS experiment at LHC. The GE1/1 CMS project consists of 144 GEM chambers of
about 0.5 m2 active area each, employing three GEM foils per chamber, to be
installed in the forward region of the CMS endcap during the long shutdown of
LHC in 2108-2019. The large active area of each GE1/1 chamber consists of GEM
foils that are mechanically stretched in order to secure their flatness and the
consequent uniform performance of the GE1/1 chamber across its whole active
surface. So far FBGs have been used in high energy physics mainly as high
precision positioning and re-positioning sensors and as low cost, easy to
mount, low space consuming temperature sensors. FBGs are also commonly used for
very precise strain measurements in material studies. In this work we present a
novel use of FBGs as flatness and mechanical tensioning sensors applied to the
wide GEM foils of the GE1/1 chambers. A network of FBG sensors have been used
to determine the optimal mechanical tension applied and to characterise the
mechanical tension that should be applied to the foils. We discuss the results
of the test done on a full-sized GE1/1 final prototype, the studies done to
fully characterise the GEM material, how this information was used to define a
standard assembly procedure and possible future developments.

decomposed into an ensemble of nuclear wavepackets effectively governed by

Employing a one-dimensional model system we show that for strong nonadiabatic

Born-Oppenheimer PESs. The nature of these steps is identified as an effect of
electron-nuclear correlation. Furthermore, a direct comparison with similar
discontinuities recently reported in the context of the exact factorization

quantum harmonic oscillator (electromagnetic field or mechanical resonator)

mechanism. By driving the qubit monochromatically, the oscillation of the qubit
state modifies the effective frequency of the driving force acting on the
oscillator, and a resonant or near-resonant driving on the oscillator can be
achieved. The displacement of the oscillator is then significantly enhanced due
to the small detuning of the driving force and can exceed that of the
zero-point fluctuation. This effect can be used to prepare quantum
superpositions of macroscopically distinct coherent states in the oscillator.
We present detailed studies on this state-generation scheme in both the closed-
and open-system cases. This approach can be implemented in various experimental
platforms, such as cavity- or circuit-QED systems, electromechanical systems,
and spin-cantilever systems.

identified by the walktrap community detection method, by trains of

communities, keeping the rest unperturbed, the external stimulations are able
to propagate to some of them but not to all. There are also perturbations that
do not trigger any response. We found that this depends on the initially
perturbed community. Finally, we relate our findings for the former cases with
low neural synchronization, self-criticality and large information flow
capacity, and interpret them as the ability of the brain network to respond to
external perturbations when it works at criticality and its information flow

conditions and a necessary condition for the achievability of a distortion pair
expressed as a function of the channel SNR and of the source correlation. The
main sufficient condition is obtained by an extension of the vector-quantizer
scheme suggested by Lapidoth-Tinguely, for the case without conferencing, to
the case with unidirectional conference. In the high-SNR regime, and when the
capacity of the conference channel is unlimited, these necessary and sufficient
conditions are shown to agree. We evaluate the precise high-SNR asymptotics for
a subset of distortion pairs when the capacity of the conference channel is
unlimited in which case we show that a separation based scheme attains these
optimal distortion pairs. However, with symmetric average-power constraints and
fixed conferencing capacity, at high-SNR the latter separation based scheme is
shown to be suboptimal.

source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is predicted to cast a shadow upon the emission
of the surrounding plasma flow, which encodes the influence of general
relativity in the strong-field regime. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network with a goal of imaging nearby
supermassive black holes (in particular Sgr A* and M87) with angular resolution
sufficient to observe strong gravity effects near the event horizon. General
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations show that radio emission
from Sgr A* exhibits vari- ability on timescales of minutes, much shorter than
the duration of a typical VLBI imaging experiment, which usually takes several
hours. A changing source structure during the observations, however, violates
one of the basic assumptions needed for aperture synthesis in radio
interferometry imaging to work. By simulating realistic EHT observations of a
model movie of Sgr A*, we demonstrate that an image of the average quiescent
emission, featuring the characteristic black hole shadow and photon ring
predicted by general relativity, can nonetheless be obtained by observing over
multiple days and subsequent processing of the visibilities (scaling,
averaging, and smoothing) before imaging. Moreover, it is shown that this
procedure can be combined with an existing method to mitigate the effects of
interstellar scattering. Taken together, these techniques allow the black hole
shadow in the Galactic center to be recovered on the reconstructed image.

style is a direct threat to the privacy and anonymity of programmers. While
recent work found that source code can be attributed to authors with high
accuracy, attribution of executable binaries appears to be much more difficult.
Many distinguishing features present in source code, e.g. variable names, are
removed in the compilation process, and compiler optimization may alter the
structure of a program, further obscuring features that are known to be useful
in determining authorship. We examine programmer de-anonymization from the
standpoint of machine learning, using a novel set of features that include ones
obtained by decompiling the executable binary to source code. We adapt a
powerful set of techniques from the domain of source code authorship
attribution along with stylistic representations embedded in assembly,
resulting in successful de-anonymization of a large set of programmers.
  We evaluate our approach on data from the Google Code Jam, obtaining
attribution accuracy of up to 96% with 100 and 83% with 600 candidate

suggest that the formation or presence of planets plays a role in the degree of
internal mixing on or before the red giant branch. However, a multitude of
factors affect A(Li) during the red giant phase, and when the abundances of our
sample are compared to abundances of red giants in other open clusters
available in the literature, we find that they all fall well within a much

The bias results from selecting, among several noisy estimates, the apparent

off-policy learning algorithm that regularizes the value estimates by
penalizing deterministic policies in the beginning of the learning process. We
show that this method reduces the bias of the value-function estimation,
leading to faster convergence to the optimal value and the optimal policy.
Moreover, G-learning enables the natural incorporation of prior domain
knowledge, when available. The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it
avoid some exploration costs, a property usually attributed only to on-policy
algorithms. We illustrate these ideas in several examples, where G-learning
results in significant improvements of the convergence rate and the cost of the

Indium phosphide QDs have emerged as a primary candidate to replace the more
toxic CdSe QDs, but production of InP QDs with the desired properties lags
behind other QD materials due to a poor understanding of how to tune the growth
process. Using high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations, we report the first direct observation of the early stage
intermediates and subsequent formation of an InP cluster from separated indium
and phosphorus precursors. In our simulations, indium agglomeration precedes
formation of In-P bonds. We observe a predominantly intercomplex pathway in
which In-P bonds form between one set of precursor copies while the carboxylate
ligand of a second indium precursor in the agglomerated indium abstracts a
ligand from the phosphorus precursor. This process produces an indium-rich
cluster with structural properties comparable to those in bulk zinc-blende InP
crystals. Minimum energy pathway characterization of the AIMD-sampled reaction
events confirms these observations and identifies that In-carboxylate
dissociation energetics solely determine the barrier along the In-P bond
formation pathway, which is lower for intercomplex (13 kcal/mol) than
intracomplex (21 kcal/mol) mechanisms. The phosphorus precursor chemistry, on
the other hand, controls the thermodynamics of the reaction. Our observations
of the differing roles of precursors in controlling QD formation strongly
suggests that the challenges thus far encountered in InP QD synthesis
optimization may be attributed to an overlooked need for a cooperative tuning
strategy that simultaneously addresses the chemistry of both indium and
phosphorus precursors.

salvation chemical potential $\Delta\mu_s$ between liquid and gas is
considerably larger than the thermal energy $k_BT$ for each solute particle and
the attractive interaction among the solute particles is weaker than that among
the solvent particles. In these conditions, the saturated vapor pressure
increases by an amount equal to the solute density in liquid multiplied by the
large factor $k_BT \exp(\Delta\mu_s/k_BT)$. As a result, phase separation is
induced at low solute densities in liquid and the new phase remains in gaseous
states, while the liquid pressure is outside the coexistence curve of the
solvent. This explains the widely observed formation of stable nanobubbles in
ambient water with a dissolved gas. We calculate the density and stress
profiles across planar and spherical interfaces, where the surface tension
decreases with increasing the interfacial solute adsorption. We realize stable
solute-rich bubbles with radius about 30 nm, which minimize the free energy

analysis of shock responses of heterogeneous materials in our group in recent
years. The basic methodology is as below. We first decompose the problem into
different scales. Construct/Choose a model according to the scale and main
mechanisms working at that scale. Perform numerical simulations using the
relatively mature schemes. The physical information is transferred between
neighboring scales in such a way: The statistical information of results in
smaller scale contributes to establishing the constitutive equation in larger
one. Except for the microscopic Molecular Dynamics (MD) model, both the
mesoscopic and macroscopic models can be further classified into two
categories, solidic and fluidic models, respectively. The basic ideas and key
techniques of the MD, material point method and discrete Boltzmann method are
briefly reviewed. Among various schemes used in analyzing the complex fields
and structures, the morphological analysis and the home-built software, GISO,
are briefly introduced. New observations are summarized for scales from the
larger to the smaller.

century alliterative poem, Piers Plowman, in 1886. In preparation for this he
located forty-five manuscripts, and to compare dialects, he published excerpts
from each of these. This paper does three statistical analyses using these
excerpts, each of which mimics a task he did in writing his critical edition.
First, he combined multiple versions of a poetic line to create a best line,
which is compared to the mean string that is computed by a generalization of
the arithmetic mean that uses edit distance. Second, he claims that a certain
subset of manuscripts varies little. This is quantified by computing a string
variance, which is closely related to the above generalization of the mean.
Third, he claims that the manuscripts fall into three groups, which is a
clustering problem that is addressed by using edit distance. The overall goal
is to develop methodology that would be of use to a literary critic.

computational complexity and frequent memory accesses. Network pruning is a
promising technique to solve this problem. However, pruning usually results in
irregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts
but also do not fit well on parallel computation. We introduce structured
sparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks, which are channel
wise, kernel wise and intra kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity
is very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded
computers, parallel computing environments and hardware based systems. To
decide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method
uses a particle filtering approach. The importance weight of each particle is
assigned by computing the misclassification rate with corresponding
connectivity pattern. The pruned network is re-trained to compensate for the
losses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we
particularly show that intra kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint
can significantly reduce the size of kernel and feature map matrices. The
pruned network is finally fixed point optimized with reduced word length
precision. This results in significant reduction in the total storage size
providing advantages for on-chip memory based implementations of deep neural
networks.

basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations including electron
correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, most chemists and
physicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated spin orientations
are related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. The
objective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework of thinking
about and predicting the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion by
examining the relationship between the spin orientation and the local
electronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion (i.e., an ion
possessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with
main-group ligand atoms to form a polyhedron, and the d-states of the
polyhedron are split because the antibonding interactions of the metal
d-orbitals with the p orbitals of the surrounding ligands depend on the
symmetries of the orbitals involved. The magnetic ion of the polyhedron has a
certain preferred spin direction because its split d-states interact among
themselves under SOC and because the energy lowering associated with the
SOC-induced interactions depends on spin orientation. The preferred spin
direction can be readily predicted on the basis of perturbation theory, in
which the SOC is taken as perturbation and the split d-states as unperturbed
states, by inspecting the magnetic quantum numbers of its d-orbitals present in
the HOMO and LUMO of the polyhedron. Experimentally, the determination of the
preferred spin orientations of magnetic ions requires a sophisticated level of
experiments. Theoretically, it requires an elaborate level of DFT electronic
structure calculations. We show that the outcomes of such experimental
measurements and theoretical calculations can be predicted by a simple
perturbation theory analysis.

effective horizons are also dynamically created on the string worldsheet. The
quark and antiquark are thus causally disconnected, and the string transitions
to two straight strings. The forces acting on the endpoints vanish with a power
law whose slope depends on the perturbations. The condition for this transition
to occur is that energy injection exceeds the static energy between the

observations, is both valuable to the agent, allowing it to base its actions on
better informed internal states, and a ""curse"", exploding the size and
diversity of the internal state space. One attempt to deal with this is to
focus on reactive policies, that only base their actions on the most recent
observation. However, even reactive policies can be demanding on resources, and
agents need to pay selective attention to only some of the information
available to them in observations. In this report we present the
minimum-information principle for selective attention in reactive agents. We
further motivate this approach by reducing the general problem of optimal
control in POMDPs, to reactive control with complex observations. Lastly, we
explore a newly discovered phenomenon of this optimization process - period
doubling bifurcations. This necessitates periodic policies, and raises many
more questions regarding stability, periodicity and chaos in optimal control.

by the Isothermal Sphere model. To do so we discuss several new approaches for
the analysis of Dark Matter direct detection data, with the goal to remove or
reduce its dependence on specific theoretical assumptions, and to extend its
scope: the factorization approach of astrophysics uncertainties, the
classification and study of WIMP-nucleon interactions within non--relativistic
field theory, inelastic scattering and isovector-coupling cancellations
including subdominant two-nucleon NLO effects. Typically, combining two or more
of these ingredients can lead to conclusions which are very different to what
usually claimed in the literature. This shows that we are only starting now to

[Pecora \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. {\bf 5}, 4079 (2014)], it is found that
stable synchronous clusters may coexist with many non-synchronous nodes in the
asynchronous regime, resembling the chimera state observed in regular networks
of non-locally coupled periodic oscillators. Although of practical
significance, this new type of state, namely the chimera-synchronization state,
is hardly generated for the general complex networks, due to either the
topological instabilities or the weak coupling strength. Here, based on the
strategy of pinning coupling, we propose an effective method for inducing
chimera-synchronization in symmetric complex network of coupled chaotic
oscillators. We are able to argue mathematically that, by pinning a group of
nodes satisfying permutation symmetry, there always exits a critical pinning
strength beyond which the unstable chimera-synchronization states can be
successfully induced. The feasibility and efficiency of the control method are
verified by numerical simulations of both artificial and real-world complex
networks, with the numerical results well fitted by the theoretical
predictions.

development of cancer, exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, such as alcohol, can
also contribute to disease development. However, the effects of chronic
alcoholism on normal or pre-carcinogenic cells/tissues in different organelles
are not well understood. Therefore, we herein study the effect of alcohol
consumption on colonic nucleus using control and azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS) treated carcinogenic mice. Previous studies showed that
progression of carcinogenesis is associated with increase in the degree of
intranuclear nanoscale structural disorder. In the present work, we quantify
the degree of nanostructural disorder as a measure of carcinogenesis. To
accomplish this, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of respective
colonic epithelial cell nuclei are used to construct disordered optical
lattices, and the properties of nanoscale disorder are then studied by
analyzing the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the spatially localized
eigenfunctions of these optical lattices. Nanoscale structural disorder
strength, as a marker of cancer progression, is measured in the length scale of
10 to 75 nm. Results show no significant visible effect in nanoscale structural
changes on colon cell nuclei from alcohol exposure. However, alcohol was found
to act as an enhancer of nanoscale disorder in precancerous cells and, hence,
carcinogenic processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to quantify the effect of alcohol on early carcinogenic biological cells, using
mesoscopic condensed matter physics.

generate high-energy gamma rays, which finally contribute to the diffuse
high-energy gamma-ray background after they escape the sources. It was recently
found that, the high flux of neutrinos at $\sim30$ TeV detected by IceCube lead
to a cumulative gamma-ray flux exceeding the Fermi isotropic gamma-ray
background at 10-100 GeV, implying that the neutrinos are produced by hidden
sources of cosmic rays, where GeV-TeV gamma-rays are not transparent. Here we
suggest that relativistic jets in tidal disruption events (TDEs) of
supermassive black holes are such hidden sources. We consider the jet
propagation in an extended,optically thick envelope around the black hole,
which is resulted from the ejected material during the disruption. While
powerful jets can break free from the envelope, less powerful jets would be
choked inside the envelope. The jets accelerate cosmic rays through internal
shocks or reverse shocks and further produce neutrinos via interaction with the
surrounding dense medium or photons. All three TDE jets discovered so far are
not detected by Fermi/LAT, suggesting that GeV-TeV gamma-rays are absorbed in
these jets. The cumulative neutrino flux from TDE jets can account for the
neutrino flux observed by IceCube at PeV energies and may also account for the
higher flux at $\sim30$ TeV if less powerful, choked jets are present in the
majority of TDEs.

their generation during inflation, we find that a given magnetic mode with
wavenumber $k$ evolves, after inflation, according to the values of $k\eta_e$,
$n_{\mathbf{k}}$, and $\Omega_k$, where $\eta_e$ is the conformal time at the
end of inflation, $n_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the number density spectrum of
inflation-produced photons, and $\Omega_k$ is the phase difference between the
two Bogolubov coefficients which characterize the state of that mode at the end
of inflation. For any realistic inflationary magnetogenesis scenario, we find
that $n_{\mathbf{k}}^{-1} \ll |k\eta_e| \ll 1$, and three evolutionary
scenarios are possible: ($i$) $|\Omega_k \mp \pi| = \mathcal{O}(1)$, in which
case the evolution of the magnetic spectrum $B_k(\eta)$ is adiabatic,
$a^2B_k(\eta) = \mbox{const}$, with $a$ being the expansion parameter; ($ii$)
$|\Omega_k \mp \pi| \ll |k\eta_e|$, in which case the evolution is
superadiabatic, $a^2B_k(\eta) \propto \eta$; ($iii$) $|k\eta_e| \ll |\Omega_k
\mp \pi| \ll 1$ or $|k\eta_e| \sim |\Omega_k \mp \pi| \ll 1$, in which case an
early phase of adiabatic evolution is followed, after a time $\eta_\star \sim
|\Omega_k \mp \pi|/k$, by a superadiabatic evolution. Once a given mode
reenters the horizon, it remains frozen into the plasma and then evolves
adiabatically till today. As a corollary of our results, we find that
inflation-generated magnetic fields evolve adiabatically on all scales and for
all times in conformal-invariant free Maxwell theory, while they evolve
superadiabatically after inflation on superhorizon scales in the
non-conformal-invariant Ratra model. The latter result supports our recent

progresses through a stable medium at a fixed speed, rendering it unstable in
its wake. By controlling the speed of excitation, such stimuli, or ""triggers,""
can mediate pattern forming fronts which freely invade an unstable equilibrium
and control which pattern is selected. In this work, we analytically and
numerically study when the trigger perturbs an oscillatory pushed free front.
In such a situation, the resulting patterned front, which we call a pushed
trigger front, exhibits a variety of interesting phenomenon, including snaking,
non-monotonic wavenumber selection, and hysteresis. Assuming the existence of a
generic oscillatory pushed free front, we use heteroclinic bifurcation
techniques to prove the existence of trigger fronts in an abstract setting
motivated by the spatial dynamics approach. We then derive a leading order
expansion for the selected wavenumber in terms of the trigger speed.
Furthermore, we show that such a bifurcation curve is governed by the
difference of certain strong-stable and weakly-stable spatial eigenvalues
associated with the decay of the free pushed front. We also study prototypical
examples of these phenomena in the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg Landau
equation and a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation.

physics. In quantum optics the occurrence of such a phenomena in the evolution
of an atomic state, interacting with a light field initially in a coherent

demonstrated experimentally. In this paper we revisit the JCM with the
Monte-Carlo wave function approach and investigate the time evolution of the
photon emission rate of the atom in a cavity. Analytical and numerical quantum
trajectory calculations show that the cavity and the initial field statistics
strongly influence the photon emission dynamics. A coherent field indeed gives
rise to a collapse and revival behavior that mirrors atomic state evolution.
However, there are differences between the two. The emission rate for a field
in a Fock number state exhibits a sinusoidal oscillation, and there exists a
quiescent period for a thermal field. These properties are quite different from
those in free space. It is also shown that the fluctuation in photon emission
is much less than that of the atomic population.

construction of the desingularization $[[G:L]]$ of $G$ along $L$ is based on a
canonical fibered pull-back groupoid structure result for $G$ in a neighborhood

obtained by integrating a certain groupoid morphism, using results of Moerdijk

defined using a construction of Debord and Skandalis (Advances in Math., 2014).
The space of units of the desingularization $[[G:L]]$ is $[M:L]$, the blow up

tidal disruption event, however a supernova origin has not yet been ruled out.
Here we add several new pieces of information to the puzzle of the nature of
the transient that powered its variable coronal lines: 1) an optical light
curve from the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey that
serendipitously catches the optical flare, and 2) late-time observations of the
host galaxy with the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) and X-ray
telescope (XRT) and the ground-based Mercator telescope. The well-sampled,
$\sim10$-year long, unfiltered LINEAR light curve constrains the onset of the
flare to a precision of $\pm5$ days and enables us to place a lower limit on
the peak optical magnitude. Difference imaging allows us to estimate the
location of the flare in proximity of the host galaxy core. Comparison of the
\textsl{GALEX} data (early 2006) with the recently acquired Swift UVOT (June
2015) and Mercator observations (April 2015) demonstrate a decrease in the UV
flux over a $\sim 10$ year period, confirming that the flare was UV-bright. The
long-lived UV-bright emission, detected 1.8 rest-frame years after the start of
the flare, strongly disfavors a SN origin. These new data allow us to conclude
that the flare was indeed powered by the tidal disruption of a star by a
supermassive black hole and that TDEs are in fact capable of powering the
enigmatic class of ECLEs.

associated non-equilibrium effects can be removed by employing the Jarzynski
equality (JE), then the global equilibrium distribution can be reproduced.
However, the original JE requires the initial distribution of the
non-equilibrium process is equilibrium, which largely limits the application of
the non-equilibrium method in equilibrium sampling. By extending the previous
method, the reweighted ensemble dynamics (RED), which re-weights many
equilibrium simulation trajectories from arbitrary initial distribution to
reproduce the global equilibrium, to non-equilibrium simulations, we present a

experiences lies in ""the unity or integrity of experience"" (DE, 248). In Art as
Experience, Dewey presents aesthetic experience as the fundamental form of
human experience that undergirds all other forms of experiences, and can also
bring together multiple forms of experiences, locating this form of experience
in the work of artists. Particularly relevant to our current concern
(computational literacy), Dewey calls the process through which a person
transforms a material into an expressive medium an aesthetic experience (AE,
68-69). We argue here that the kind of experience that is appropriate for a
democratic education in the context of children's computational science is
essentially aesthetic in nature. Given that aesthetics has received relatively
little attention in STEM education research, our purpose here is to highlight
the power of Deweyan aesthetic experience in making computational thinking
available to and attractive to all children, including those who are

corresponding pressure fields, which together approximately comply to a
prescribed flow model. The main step in our approach consists of the
appropriate use of the velocity measurements in the design of a linearized flow
model which can be shown to be well-posed and consistent with the true velocity
and pressure fields up to measurement and modeling errors. The reconstruction
procedure is formulated as a linear quadratic optimal control problem and the
resulting filter has analyzable smoothing and approximation properties. We also

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) had formed early on. Accretion of matter onto
remnants of Population III stars leading to SMBHs is a very slow process, and
therefore, such models encounter difficulties in explaining quasars detected at
$ z \gtrsim 6$. In this paper, we invoke collapse of dark bosonic halo matter,
existing initially in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase, to
lead to formation of SMBH. Making use of Gross-Pitaevskii equation and
employing a Gaussian trial wavefunction, we determine the time dependence of
its parameters and thereby, track the time evolution of the wavefunction. If
the condensate, made up of identical dark bosons of mass $m$, collapses to form
a black hole of mass $M_{eff}$ as soon as the former's effective size shrinks
below the corresponding Schwarzschild radius, a simple inequality $ m \ M_{eff}
\gtrsim 0.64 \ m^2_{Pl} $ can be derived, that ensues from a competition
between attractive self-gravity and quantum repulsion arising due to
uncertainty principle. We show that formation of SMBHs takes place on dynamical
time scales $\sim 10^8$ yrs. Existence of ultra-light ($m \sim 10^{-23} \
\mbox{eV}$) dark bosons not only can lead to SMBHs of mass $\sim 10^{12} \
M_\odot$ at $ z > 6$ but also such particles can masquerade both as dark matter
as well as dark energy. Discovery of aligned radio-jets in the ELAIS-N1 GMRT
deep field leads us to make simple estimates to demonstrate that vortices of a
rotating BEC that collapse to form black holes can give rise to SMBHs with
aligned spins on scales exceeding cluster size length scales, each with angular
momentum $J \lesssim 3.6 \ n_W \frac {G M^2} {c}$, where $n_W$ and $M$ are the
winding number and mass of a vortex, respectively.

from academia, financial service industry and enthusiasts. The trade-off
between transaction confirmation throughput and centralization of hash power do
not allow Bitcoin to perform at the same level as modern payment systems. Block
Advertisement Protocol is proposed as a step to resolve this issue. The
protocol allows block mining and block relaying to happen in parallel. The
protocol dictates a miner to advertise the block it is going to mine allowing
other miners to collect all the transactions in advance. When a block in mined,
only header is relayed since most of data about the block is already known to
all miners.

energies of systems in simulations and experiments. However, wider applications
of the JE are limited by the requirement that the initial distribution of
non-equilibrium trajectories must be equilibrium. Here we extend the JE to a
matrix form, the Jarzynski matrix equality (JME), which transforms the free
energies of metastable conformational regions in the initial system to that of
final one. Therefore, we can calculate the free energies from non-equilibrium
trajectories which started from an arbitrary initial distribution. We
demonstrate the application of the JME in toy models, Lennard-Jones fluids, and
polymer chain models, show its good efficiency in calculation of free energy
with a satisfactory accuracy. The JME extends applications of the
non-equilibrium method in estimate of free energy in complex system where the
initial global equilibrium is difficult to reach.

is presented in this paper by taking into account the hitherto unexplored
effect of correlations among the pointer degrees of freedom which pertain to an

extension of the earlier results, showing that, for complex weak values, the
correlations among different pointer degrees of freedom can crucially affect
the way the imaginary parts of the weak values are related to the observed
shifts of the mean pointer position and momentum. The particular relevance of
this analysis is discussed in the case of sequential weak interactions,
followed by a postselection (called sequential WM) which, in the special case,
reduces to the usual WM scheme involving a single weak interaction and
postseletion, modified by the effect of pointer state correlations.

9, with a resolution of ~0""18. We resolved the binary system at both bands, and
derived the continuum spectral index of the stars and their relative position.
We also analyzed ALMA SciVer data obtained in bands 6 and 3. Measurements at
centimeter wavelengths obtained by other authors have been included in our
study of the spectral energy distribution of the Mira components. The Mira A
continuum emission has a spectral index of 1.98+-0.04 extending from
submillimeter down to centimeter wavelengths. The spectral index of the Mira B
continuum emission is 1.93+-0.06 at wavelengths ranging from submillimeter to
~3.1 mm, and a shallower spectral index of 1.22+-0.09 at longer wavelengths.
The Mira A continuum emission up to submillimeter wavelengths is consistent
with that of a radio photosphere surrounding the evolved star for which models
predict a spectral index close to 2. The Mira B continuum emission cannot be
described with a single ionized component. An extremely compact and dense
region around the star can produce the nearly thermal continuum measured in the
0.4-3.1 mm wavelength range, and an inhomogeneous, less dense, and slightly
larger ionized envelope could be responsible for the emission at longer
wavelengths. Our results illustrate the potential of ALMA for high precision
astrometry of binary systems. We have found a significant discrepancy of ~14
milliarcsec between the ALMA measurements and the predicted orbit positions.

shell-crossing and shell-focusing naked singularities. These singularities can
be physically regarded as the breakdown of dust description, where strong
pressure gradient force plays a role. We adopt the simultaneous big bang
condition to extract a growing mode of adiabatic perturbation in the flat FLRW
universe. If the density perturbation has a sufficiently homogeneous central
region and a sufficiently sharp transition to the background FLRW universe, its
central shell-focusing singularity is globally covered. If the density
concentration is sufficiently large, no shell-crossing singularity appears and
a black hole is formed. If the density concentration is not sufficiently large,
a shell-crossing singularity appears. In this case, a large dipole moment
significantly advances shell-crossing singularities and they tend to appear
before the black hole formation. In contrast, a shell-crossing singularity
unavoidably appears in the spherical and nonspherical evolution of cosmological
voids. The present analysis is general and applicable to cosmological nonlinear

convergence of phase fields in three dimensions.
  More in detail, we show that, in three space dimensions, points close to
which the phase fields stay bounded away from a pure phase lie either in the
support of the limiting mass measure $\mu$ or contribute a positive amount to
the limiting Willmore energy. Thus there can only be finitely many such points.
  As an application, we investigate the Hausdorff limit of level sets of
sequences of phase fields with bounded energy. We also obtain results on
boundedness and $L^p$-convergence of phase fields and convergence from outside
the interval between the wells of a double-well potential. For minimisers of
suitable energy functionals, we deduce uniform convergence of the phase fields
from essentially uniform convergence.

affecting the Poisson equation which determines the plasma potential in the

potential, which is then incorporated into the Poisson equation. The resultant

Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance
estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations
calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences
in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of
differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution
on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical
guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample
settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently
challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes
the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator
such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals
on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of
comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure
among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive
the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters
are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the
debiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an
efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused
lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs.
We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as
neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.

concentrated frames on Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature, and the
applications of these frames to the analysis of function spaces. In this
general context, the notion of frequency is defined using the spectrum of a
distinguished differential operator on the manifold, typically the
Laplace-Beltrami operator. Our exposition starts with the case of the real
line, which serves as motivation and blueprint for the material in the
subsequent sections.
  After the discussion of the real line, our presentation starts out in the
most abstract setting proving rather general sampling-type results for
appropriately defined Paley-Wiener vectors in Hilbert spaces. These results
allow a handy construction of Paley-Wiener frames in $L_2(\mfd{M})$, for a
Riemann manifold of bounded geometry, essentially by taking a partition of
unity in frequency domain. The discretization of the associated integral
kernels then gives rise to frames consisting of smooth functions in
$L_2(\mfd{M})$, with fast decay in space and frequency. These frames are used
to introduce new norms in corresponding Besov spaces on $\mfd{M}$.
  For compact Riemannian manifolds the theory extends to $L_p$ and Besov
spaces. Moreover, for compact homogeneous manifolds, one obtains the so-called
product property for eigenfunctions of certain operators and proves a cubature
formulae with positive coefficients which allow to construct Parseval frames
that characterize Besov spaces in terms of coefficient decay.
  Throughout the paper, the general theory is exemplified with the help of
various concrete and relevant examples, such as the unit sphere and the
Poincar\'{e} half plane.

For character detection, we use the HSC features instead of using the
Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The HSC features are extracted
by computing sparse codes with dictionaries that are learned from data using
K-SVD, and aggregating per-pixel sparse codes to form local histograms. For
word recognition, we integrate multiple cues including character detection
scores and geometric contexts in an objective function. The final recognition
results are obtained by searching for the words which correspond to the maximum
value of the objective function. The parameters in the objective function are
learned using the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training method.
Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed

significantly and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

from possibly noisy measurements, the most popular approach is $\ell_1$-norm
minimization. Upper bounds for the $\ell_2$- norm of the error between the true
and estimated vectors are given in [1] and reviewed in [2], while bounds for
the $\ell_1$-norm are given in [3]. When the unknown vector is not
conventionally sparse but is ""group sparse"" instead, a variety of alternatives
to the $\ell_1$-norm have been proposed in the literature, including the group
LASSO, sparse group LASSO, and group LASSO with tree structured overlapping
groups. However, no error bounds are available for any of these modified
objective functions. In the present paper, a unified approach is presented for
deriving upper bounds on the error between the true vector and its
approximation, based on the notion of decomposable and $\gamma$-decomposable
norms. The bounds presented cover all of the norms mentioned above, and also
provide a guideline for choosing norms in future to accommodate alternate forms
of sparsity.

infrastructure), but for two such user-BS pairs attempting the key
establishment simultaneously. The challenge in this novel setting lies in that
a user can eavesdrop another BS-user communications. It is thus paramount to
ensure the two keys are established with no leakage to the other user, in spite
the interference across neighboring cells. We model the system with BS-user
communication through an interference channel and user-BS communication through
a public channel. We find the region including achievable secret key rates for
the general case that the interference channel (IC) is discrete and memoryless.
Our results are examined for a Gaussian IC. In this setup, we investigate the
performance of different transmission schemes for power allocation. The chosen
transmission scheme by each BS essentially affects the secret key rate of the
other BS-user. Assuming base stations are trustworthy but that they seek to
maximize the corresponding secret key rate, a game-theoretic setting arises to
analyze the interaction between the base stations.We model our key agreement
scenario in normal form for different power allocation schemes to understand
performance without cooperation. Numerical simulations illustrate the

move in bounded orbits around Charon or escape through the necks around the
Lagrangian points $L_1$ and $L_2$ or even collide with the surface of Charon.
We explore four of the five possible Hill's regions configurations depending on
the value of the Jacobi constant which is of course related with the total
orbital energy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space
mixing by classifying initial conditions of orbits and distinguishing between
three types of motion: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) collisional. In
particular, we locate the different basins and we relate them with the
corresponding spatial distributions of the escape and collision times. Our
results reveal the high complexity of this planetary system. Furthermore, the
numerical analysis shows a strong dependence of the properties of the
considered basins with the total orbital energy, with a remarkable presence of
fractal basin boundaries along all the regimes. Our results are compared with
earlier ones regarding the Saturn-Titan planetary system.

~1800 hours of coverage on 121 separate nights. The star was in its normal

eclipses every 4.72 hours. Remarkably, the star also showed a nearly sinusoidal

interpret this as the signature of a retrograde precession (wobble) of the

of mid-eclipse, indicating that the disc's centre of light moves with this

of Au+Au collisions at SIS energies into local temperature, baryon and pion

in-medium $\rho$ spectral function that describes available spectra at
ultrarelativistic collision energies. In particular, we analyze how far the
resulting yields and slopes of the invariant-mass spectra can probe the
lifetime and temperatures of the fireball. We find that dilepton radiation sets
in after the initial overlap phase of the colliding nuclei of about 7 fm/c, and
lasts for about 13 fm/c. This duration closely coincides with the development
of the transverse collectivity of the baryons, thus establishing a direct
correlation between hadronic collective effects and thermal EM radiation, and
supporting a near local equilibration of the system. This fireball ""lifetime""
is substantially smaller than the typical 20-30 fm/c that naive considerations
of the density evolution alone would suggest. We furthermore find that the
total dilepton yield radiated into the invariant-mass window of $M=0.3-0.7$
GeV/$c^{2}$, normalized to the number of charged pions, follows a relation to
the lifetime found earlier in the (ultra-) relativistic regime of heavy-ion
collisions, and thus corroborates the versatility of this tool. The spectral
slopes of the invariant-mass spectra above the $\phi$ mass provide a
thermometer of the hottest phases of the collision, and agree well with the
maximal temperatures extracted from the coarse-grained hadron spectra.

here and transform the Fermi liquid of BCS excitations into an ideal gas by
redefining the quasiparticle energies. The new FES quasiparticles exhibit the
same energy gap as the BCS quasiparticles, but a different DOS, which is finite
at any quasiparticle energy.
  We also discuss the effect of the remnant electron-electron interaction
(electron-electron interaction beyond the BCS pairing model) and show that this
can stabilize the BCS condensate, increasing the critical temperature.

an essential way in the low-energy limit, where the logarithmic corrections

longitudinal electromagnetic fields, we derive the renormalization group
equations for the velocities of the tilted Weyl fermions in two dimensions, and
found that they increase as the energy decreases and eventually hit the speed
of light $c$ to result in the Cherenkov radiation. Especially, the system
restores the isotropic Weyl cone even when the bare Weyl cone is strongly
tilted and the velocity of electrons becomes negative in certain directions.

candidate as a twin particle of the 125 GeV scalar boson, both emerging from
the large mixing of the scalar toponium and scalar gluonium. The twin
pseudoscalar particles are expected to have smaller masses. The discovery of
the 750 GeV resonance is possible only with a much more data than for the 125
GeV resonance since only the gluonium component is detectable above the
toponium threshold. The similar type of the QCD resonances is expected in the
bottomonium-gluonium system. If the LHC will discover all these heavy
quarkonium-gluonium resonances, the absence of the Higgs scalar should not be
considered an obstacle because the nonsingular theory with the UV cutoff fixed
by the weak boson masses is superior to the Standard Model. Namely, it solves
the basic problems for the SM such as: (1) the existence of light neutrinos,
(2) dark matter particles to be the heavy Majorana neutrinos and (3) broken
lepton and baryon numbers.

in an interesting contrast with the point-local Krein space setting of gauge
theory. Already in the absence of interactions the Wilson loop in a Hilbert
space setting has a ""topological property"" which is missing in the gauge
theoretic description (Haag duality, Aharonov-Bohm effect); the conceptual
differences increase in the presence of interactions. The Hilbert space
positivity weakens the causal localization properties if interacting fields
which results in the replacement of the gauge-variant point-local matter fields
in Krein space by string-local physical fields in Hilbert space. The gauge
invariance of the perturbative S-matrix corresponds to its independence of the
spacelike string direction of its interpolating.fields. In contrast to gauge
theory, whose physical range is limited to gauge invariant perturbative
S-matrix and local observables, its Hilbert space string-local counterpart in
is a full-fledged quantum field theory. The new setting reveals that the
Lie-structure of self-coupled vector mesons results from perturbative
implementation of the causal localization principles of QFT.
