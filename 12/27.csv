agent-$i$ computes the prox map of $\xi_i$ and gradient of $f_i$, and this is
followed by local communication with neighboring agents. We also study its
stochastic gradient variant, SDPGA, which can only access to noisy estimates of
$\nabla f_i$ at each agent-$i$. This computational model abstracts a number of
applications in distributed sensing, machine learning and statistical
inference. We show ergodic convergence in both sub-optimality error and

and in particular the information obtained from electromagnetic probes that
stem from the partonic and hadronic phases. The out-of-equilibrium description
of strongly interacting relativistic fields is based on the theory of Kadanoff
and Baym. For the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamical
quasiparticle model (DQPM) for QCD in equilibrium. The widths and masses of the
quasiparticles are controlled by transport coefficients in comparison to
lattice QCD results. The resulting off-shell transport approach - denoted by
Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) - also includes covariant dynamical
hadronization and keeps track of the hadronic interactions in the final phase.
We show that PHSD captures the bulk dynamics of heavy-ion collisions from SPS
to LHC energies and provides a basis for the evaluation of the electromagnetic
emissivity, using the same dynamical parton propagators as for the system
evolution. Direct photon production in elementary processes and heavy-ion
reactions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated and the status of the photon
v2 puzzle - a large elliptic flow of the direct photons observed in A+A
collisions - is addressed. We discuss the roles of hadronic and partonic
sources for the photon spectra and the flow coefficients v2 and v3 and also the
possibility to subtract the QGP signal from observables. Furthermore, the
production of dilepton pairs is addressed from SIS to LHC energies. The
low-mass dilepton yield is enhanced due to the in-medium modification of the
rho-meson and at the lowest energy also due to a multiple regeneration of
Delta-resonances. In addition, a signal of the partonic degrees-of-freedom is
found in the intermediate dilepton mass regime (1.2GeV<M<3GeV), which can shed
light on the nature of the very early degrees-of-freedom in nucleus-nucleus

an imposed linear shear amplifies or diminishes a uniform magnetic field,
driving pressure anisotropies and hence firehose/mirror instabilities. The
evolution of the resulting microscale turbulence is considered when the shear
is switched off or reversed after one shear time (mimicking local behaviour of
a macroscopic flow), so a new macroscale configuration is superimposed on the
microscale state left behind by the previous one. There is a threshold value of
plasma beta: when $\beta\ll\Omega/S$ (ion cyclotron frequency/shear rate), the
emergence of firehose/mirror fluctuations driven unstable by shear and their
disappearance when the shear is removed/reversed are quasi-instantaneous
compared to the shear time, viz., the decay time of these fluctuations is
$\sim\beta/\Omega \ll 1/S$ (this result follows from the free decay of the
fluctuations being constrained by the same marginal-stability thresholds as
their growth). In contrast, when $\beta\gtrsim\Omega/S$ (""ultra-high"" beta),
the old microscale state can only be removed on the shear timescale. In this
regime, driven firehose fluctuations grow secularly to order-unity amplitudes,
compensating for the decay of the mean field and so pinning pressure anisotropy
at marginal stability with no appreciable scattering of particles---which is
unlike what happens at moderate $\beta$. When the shear reverses, the shearing
away of this firehose turbulence compensates for the increase in the mean field
and thus prevents growth of the pressure anisotropy, stopping the system from
going mirror-unstable. Therefore, at ultra-high beta, the system stays close to
the firehose threshold, the mirror instability is largely suppressed, while the
mean magnetic energy barely changes at all. Implications for plasma dynamo and
thus the origin of cosmic magnetism are discussed.

TeV, no extended emission at other energies has so far been detected. We report
on our analysis of X-ray data obtained with XMM-Newton of the region near MGRO
J1908+06. We searched the data for point-like sources and detected several
hard-spectrum X-ray sources that could be associated with the TeV emission,
including the gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1907+0602. We also performed an extended
source analysis to search for diffuse emission from MGRO J1908+06 but found no
evidence of diffuse X-ray emission coincident with the TeV source. We place an
upper limit of $8.7\times10^{33}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ on the X-ray luminosity of MGRO
J1908+06 in the 1-10 keV energy range. The corresponding limit on the ratio of
gamma-ray to X-ray luminosity is consistent with the ratios found for other
pulsar wind nebulae of similar age.

of the magnetic fields on the evolution of galaxies are unknown. Though not
without challenges, the dynamo theory can explain the large-scale coherent
magnetic fields which govern galaxies, but observational evidence for the
theory is so far very scarce. Putting together the available data of
non-interacting, non-cluster galaxies with known large-scale magnetic fields,
we find a tight correlation between the integrated polarized flux density,
S(PI), and the rotation speed, v(rot), of galaxies. This leads to an almost
linear correlation between the large-scale magnetic field B and v(rot),
assuming that the number of cosmic ray electrons is proportional to the star
formation rate, and a super-linear correlation assuming equipartition between
magnetic fields and cosmic rays. This correlation cannot be attributed to an
active linear alpha-Omega dynamo, as no correlation holds with global shear or
angular speed. It indicates instead a coupling between the large-scale magnetic
field and the dynamical mass of the galaxies, B ~ M^(0.25-0.4). Hence, faster
rotating and/or more massive galaxies have stronger large-scale magnetic
fields. The observed B-v(rot) correlation shows that the anisotropic turbulent
magnetic field dominates B in fast rotating galaxies as the turbulent magnetic
field, coupled with gas, is enhanced and ordered due to the strong gas
compression and/or local shear in these systems. This study supports an
stationary condition for the large-scale magnetic field as long as the
dynamical mass of galaxies is constant.

maintain the distances between a given source node $s$ and every other node in
an $n$-node $m$-edge graph $G$ undergoing edge deletions. While its static
counterpart can be solved in near-linear time, this decremental problem is much
more challenging even in the undirected unweighted case. In this case, the
classic $O(mn)$ total update time of Even and Shiloach [JACM 1981] has been the
fastest known algorithm for three decades. At the cost of a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation factor, the running time was recently improved to
$n^{2+o(1)}$ by Bernstein and Roditty [SODA 2011]. In this paper, we bring the
running time down to near-linear: We give a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm with $m^{1+o(1)}$ expected total update time, thus obtaining
near-linear time. Moreover, we obtain $m^{1+o(1)} \log W$ time for the weighted
case, where the edge weights are integers from $1$ to $W$. The only prior work
on weighted graphs in $o(m n)$ time is the $m n^{0.9 + o(1)}$-time algorithm by
Henzinger et al. [STOC 2014, ICALP 2015] which works for directed graphs with
quasi-polynomial edge weights. The expected running time bound of our algorithm
holds against an oblivious adversary.
  In contrast to the previous results which rely on maintaining a sparse
emulator, our algorithm relies on maintaining a so-called sparse $(h,
\epsilon)$-hop set introduced by Cohen [JACM 2000] in the PRAM literature. An
$(h, \epsilon)$-hop set of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a set $F$ of weighted edges
such that the distance between any pair of nodes in $G$ can be
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximated by their $h$-hop distance (given by a path
containing at most $h$ edges) on $G'=(V, E\cup F)$. Our algorithm can maintain
an $(n^{o(1)}, \epsilon)$-hop set of near-linear size in near-linear time under
edge deletions.

the results with MD and MC simulations. In a second step, we study the confined
system and check the results against those obtained from Transfer Matrix Method
and from our own Monte Carlo simulations. Squares are confined to channels with
parallel walls at angles of 0$^{\circ}$ or 45$^{\circ}$ relative to the
diagonals of the parallel hard squares, respectively, which allows for an
assessment of the effect of the external-potential symmetry on the fluid
structural properties. In general FMT overestimates bulk correlations,
predicting the existence of a columnar phase (absent in simulations) prior to
crystallisation. The equation of state predicted by FMT compares well with
simulations, although the PY approach with the virial route is better in some
range of packing fractions. The FMT is highly accurate for the structure and
correlations of the confined fluid due to the dimensional crossover property
fulfilled by the theory. Both density profiles and equations of state of the

of the theory of gravity and quantum field theory. One of its essential parts
is relativistic description of moving multi-dimensional objects called

level, they are described by an action functional extremalising the volume of a
manifold swept by a propagating membrane. This and related field theories are
collectively called membrane sigma models. Differential geometry is an
important mathematical tool in the study of string theory. It turns out that
string and membrane backgrounds can be conveniently described using objects
defined on a direct sum of tangent and cotangent bundles of the spacetime
manifold. Mathematical field studying such object is called generalized
geometry. Its integral part is the theory of Leibniz algebroids, vector bundles
with a Leibniz algebra bracket on its module of smooth sections. Special cases
of Leibniz algebroids are better known Lie and Courant algebroids. This thesis

  Chemical Compositional Simulation",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is the purpose of this work to develop new approach for chemical
compositional reservoir simulation, which may be regarded as a sequential
method. The development process can be roughly divided into the following two
stages: (1) development of a new mathematical formulation for the sequential
chemical compositional reservoir simulation, (2) implementation of a sequential
solution approach for chemical compositional reservoir simulation based on the
formulation described in this paper. This paper addresses the first stage of
the development process by presenting a new mathematical formulation of the
chemical compositional reservoir flow equations for the sequential simulation.
The newly developed mathematical formulation is extended from the model
formulation used in existing chemical compositional simulators. During the
model development process, it was discovered that the currently used chemical
compositional model estimates the adsorption effect on the transport of a
component reasonably well but it violates the principle of mass conservation.
The energy conservation equation in the currently used chemical compositional
model does not consider any change in the effective pore size caused by
adsorption, which leads to inconsistency between the overall compositional
balance equations and the energy conservation equation by violating
conservation of energy. With these partial differential equations as governing
equations, several simulators have been developed. In this article, we propose
a formulation to model the change in pore volume due to adsorption that
satisfies the conservation laws for mass and energy, and allows applying a
sequential solution approach.

transform the action back to the Einstein frame. We also show that an effective

and planets beyond the Solar System. In this paper, we explore how the
compositions of terrestrial planets are affected by dynamical evolution of
giant planets. We estimate the initial compositions of building blocks of these
rocky planets by using a simple condensation model, and numerically study the
compositions of planets formed in a few different formation models of the Solar
System. We find that the abundances of refractory and moderately volatile
elements are nearly independent of formation models, and that all the models
could reproduce the abundances of these elements of the Earth. The abundances
of atmophile elements, on the other hand, depend on the scattering rate of icy
planetesimals into the inner disc as well as the mixing rate of the inner
planetesimal disc. For the classical formation model, neither of these
mechanisms are efficient and the accretion of atmophile elements during the
final assembly of terrestrial planets appears to be difficult. For the Grand
Tack model, both of these mechanisms are efficient, which leads to a relatively
uniform accretion of atmophile elements in the inner disc. It is also possible
to have a ""hybrid"" scenario where the mixing is not very efficient but the
scattering is efficient. The abundances of atmophile elements in this case
increases with orbital radii. Such a scenario may occur in some of the
extrasolar planetary systems which are not accompanied by giant planets or
those without strong perturbations from giants. We also confirm that the Grand
Tack scenario leads to the distribution of asteroid analogues where rocky
planetesimals tend to exist interior to icy ones, and show that their overall
compositions are consistent with S-type and C-type chondrites, respectively.

  Classification of Long Movie Reviews",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the loss of semantic information, bag-of-ngram based methods still
achieve state-of-the-art results for tasks such as sentiment classification of
long movie reviews. Many document embeddings methods have been proposed to
capture semantics, but they still can't outperform bag-of-ngram based methods
on this task. In this paper, we modify the architecture of the recently
proposed Paragraph Vector, allowing it to learn document vectors by predicting
not only words, but n-gram features as well. Our model is able to capture both
semantics and word order in documents while keeping the expressive power of
learned vectors. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset shows that
our model outperforms previous deep learning models and bag-of-ngram based
models due to the above advantages. More robust results are also obtained when
our model is combined with other models. The source code of our model will be
also published together with this paper.

the overwhelming material diversity with varying normal and superconducting
(SC) properties. In this article, we deliver a comprehensive study of the SC
properties and phase diagrams using multiple tunings (such as disorder,
pressure or magnetic field in addition to doping and vice versa) across several
families of unconventional superconductors, including the copper-oxides,
heavy-fermions, organics and the recently discovered iron-pnictides,
iron-chalcogenides, and oxybismuthides. We discover that all these families
often possess two types of SC domes, with lower and higher superconducting
transition temperatures Tc, both unconventional but with distinct SC and normal
states properties. The lower Tc dome arises with or without a quantum critical
point (QCP), and not always associated with a non-Fermi liquid (NFL)
background. On the contrary, the higher-Tc dome clearly stems from a NFL or
strange metal phase, without an apparent intervening phase transition or a QCP.
The two domes appear either fully separated in the phase diagram, or merged
into one, or arise independently owing to their respective normal state
characteristics. Our findings suggest that a QCP-related mechanism is an
unlikely scenario for the NFL phase in these materials, and thereby narrows the
possibility towards short-range fluctuations of various degrees of freedom in
the momentum and frequency space. We also find that NFL physics may be a
generic route to higher-Tc superconductivity.

which is significant because it is an emergency data protection scheme against
a predictable disaster and also help DCN operators to build a complete backup

optimal selections of backup DCN nodes and data transmission paths, such that
the overall data backup cost is minimized. Extensive numerical results are also

assuming standard magnetic dipole braking. It is shown that this approach leads
to an overestimate, if the amount of residual accretion is enough to distort
the magnetosphere away from a force-free configuration, through magnetospheric
mass loading or crushing, so that the lever arm of the braking torque migrates
inside the light cylinder. We derive an alternative spin-down formula and
calculate the residual accretion rates where the formula is applicable. As a
demonstration, we apply the alternative spin-down formula to produce updated
magnetic moment estimates for the four objects above. We note that, based on
current uncertain observations of quiescent accretion rates, magnetospheric
mass loading and crushing are neither firmly indicated nor ruled out in these

upper limits are placed), it is impossible to be confident without more data

an acoustic metric which depends algebrically on the local speed of sound,
density and the background flow velocity, the latter assumed to be vorticity

beyond the irrotational constraint. Using a charged --- relativistic and

discretization of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws posed on the
two-dimensional sphere. The semi-discrete version of the proposed method is
based on a technique of local propagation speeds and it is free of any Riemann
solver. The main advantages of our scheme are the high resolution of
discontinuous solutions, its low numerical dissipation, and its simplicity for
the implementation. The proposed scheme does not use any splitting approach,
which is applied in some cases to upwind schemes in order to simplify the
resolution of Riemann problems. The semi-discrete form of the scheme is
strongly linked to the analytical properties of the nonlinear conservation law
and to the geometry of the sphere. The curved geometry is treated here in an
analytical way so that the semi-discrete form of the proposed scheme is
consistent with a geometric compatibility property. Furthermore, the time
evolution is carried out by using a total-variation-diminishing Runge-Kutta
method. A rich family of (discontinuous) stationary solutions is available for
the problem under consideration when the flux is nonlinear and foliated (as
identified by the author in an earlier work). We present here a series of
numerical examples, obtained by considering non-trivial steady state solutions
and this leads us to a good validation of the accuracy and efficiency of the
proposed central-upwind finite volume method. Our numerical tests confirm the
stability of the proposed scheme and clearly show its ability to capture
accurately discontinuous steady state solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic
conservation laws posed on the sphere.

up in superconductors which resist to the decoherence effects of high

by the BCS approximation are made of a single condensate in the weak coupling
the high temperature superconductors are made of coexisting multiple
condensates, in different spots of the k-space and the real space, some in the
BCS-BEC crossover regime and others in the BCS regime. The role of shape
resonance in the exchange interaction between these different condensates, like

quantum chromodynamics, and the connections of supergravity to the exotic
physics of string and M-theory, in this thesis we investigate the dynamical
breaking of local supersymmetry via gravitino condensation. We firstly
demonstrate non-perturbative gravitino mass generation via this mechanism in
flat spacetime, and from this derive the condensate mode wavefunction
renormalisation. By then calculating the full canonically normalised one-loop
effective potential for the condensate mode about a de Sitter background, we
demonstrate that, contrary to claims in the literature, this process may both
occur and function in a phenomenologically viable manner. In particular, we
find that outside of certain unfortunate gauge choices, the stability of the
condensate is intimately tied via gravitational degrees of freedom to the sign
of the tree-level cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that the energy
density liberated may provide the necessary inflation of the early universe via
an effective scalar degree of freedom, provided by the condensate, acting as
the inflaton. However, in so doing we find that simultaneously
phenomenologically viable inflation and supersymmetry breaking via this
approach are mutually incompatible in the simplest supergravity settings. As
this mechanism takes place in the gravitational sector, relying on the
ubiquitous gravitino torsion terms, we argue that it can also enjoy a certain
universality in the context of supergravity and string theories, in that it
does not rely on specific or arbitrary choices of potential and/or matter
content. This then allows straightforward transplantation of these results into
other settings. We present in detail our findings establishing contact between
this scenario and known phenomenology, and discuss future avenues for research.

techniques to generalize to new and unseen individuals by explicitly modeling
previously seen variations related to identity and expression. We use a
weakly-supervised approach in which identity labels are used to learn the
different factors of variation linked to identity separately from factors
related to expression. We show how probabilistic modeling of these sources of
variation allows one to learn identity-invariant representations for
expressions which can then be used to identity-normalize various procedures for
facial expression analysis and animation control. We also show how to extend
the widely used techniques of active appearance models and constrained local

transition strengths are observed in many light nuclei at relatively small
excitation energies, but their nature was unclear. Purpose: We show those
resonances can be attributed to the cluster states with asymmetric
configurations such as $\alpha$+$^{16}{\rm O}$. We explain why asymmetric
cluster states are strongly excited by the isoscalar dipole transition. We also
provide a theoretical prediction of the isoscalar dipole transitions in
$^{20}{\rm Ne}$ and $^{44}{\rm Ti}$. Method: The transition matrix is
analytically derived to clarify the excitation mechanism. The nuclear model
calculations by Brink-Bloch wave function and antisymmetrized molecular
dynamics are also performed to provide a theoretical prediction for $^{20}{\rm
Ne}$ and $^{44}{\rm Ti}$. Results: It is shown that the transition matrix is as
large as the Weisskopf estimate even though the ground state is an ideal shell
model state. Furthermore, it is considerably amplified if the ground state has
cluster correlation. The nuclear model calculations predict large transition
matrix to the $\alpha$+$^{16}{\rm O}$ and $\alpha$+$^{40}{\rm Ca}$ cluster
states comparable with or larger than the Weisskopf estimate.
  Conclusion: We conclude that the asymmetric cluster states are strongly
excited by the isoscalar dipole transition. Combined with the isoscalar
monopole transition that populates the $0^+$ cluster states, the isoscalar
transitions are promising probe for asymmetric clusters.

Firstly, we derive three different types of upper bounds which improve the
Johnson-type bounds given by Chee {\sl et al.} in some parameters. The
asymptotic lower bound of MCWCs is also examined. Then we obtain the asymptotic
existence of two classes of optimal MCWCs, which shows that the Johnson-type

asymptotically exact. Finally, we construct a class of optimal MCWCs with total
weight four and distance six by establishing the connection between such MCWCs
and a new kind of combinatorial structures. As a consequence, the maximum sizes
of MCWCs with total weight less than or equal to four are determined almost

long-range disorder limit where the scattering between the two Weyl nodes
vanishes, the conductivity diverges in the bulk model (i.e., periodic boundary

absent. In the presence of the surface, however, the inter-node relaxation
always takes place through the mediation by the surface states, and that
prevents the conductivity divergence. The magnetic-field dependence becomes
also quite different between the two cases, where the conductivity linearly
increases in $B$ in the surface boundary case, in contrast to $B$-independent
behavior in the bulk-periodic case. This is an interesting example in which the
same system exhibits completely different properties in the surface boundary

majorization for passive states but also induces a mean photon number order,

of bulk warm cloud micro-physics properties. Unlike previous bulk
parameterizations, the stochastic parameterization does not assume any
particular droplet size distribution, all parameters have physical meanings
which are recoverable from data, and the resultant parameterization has the
flexibility to utilize a variety of collision kernels. Our strategy is a new
two-fold approach to modelling the kinetic collection equation. Partitioning
the droplet spectrum into cloud and rain aggregates, we represent droplet
densities as the sum of a mean and a random fluctuation. Moreover, we use a
Taylor approximation for the collision kernel which allows the resulting
parameterization to be independent of the collision kernel.
  To address the two-moment closure for bulk microphysical equations, we
represent the higher (third) order terms as points in an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-like stochastic process. These higher order terms are
aggregate number concentration, and aggregate mixing ratio, fluctuations and
product fluctuations on regions of a 2D space of pre-collision droplets. This
2D space is naturally partitioned into four domains, each associated with a
collision process: cloud and rain self-collection, auto-conversion, and
accretion. The stochastic processes in the solution to the kinetic collection
equation are defined as the sum of a mean and the product of a standard
deviation and a random fluctuation. An order of magnitude argument on the
temporal fluctuations of the evolving cloud properties eliminates the terms
containing a standard deviation and a random fluctuation from the mean
evolution equations. The remaining terms form a coupled set of ODE's without
any ad-hoc parameters or any assumed droplet size distributions and flexible
enough to accept any collision kernel without further derivations.

of location-based workers with spatial tasks nearby (e.g., taking photos or
videos at some spatial locations). Previous works on the spatial crowdsourcing
usually designed task assignment strategies that maximize some assignment
scores, which are however only based on available workers/tasks in the system
at the time point of assigning workers/tasks. These strategies may achieve
local optimality, due to the neglect of future workers/tasks that may join the
system. In contrast, in this paper, we aim to achieve ""globally"" optimal task
assignments, by considering not only those present, but also future (via
predictions), workers/tasks. Specifically, we formalize an important problem,
namely prediction-based spatial crowdsourcing (PB-SC), which expects to obtain
a ""globally"" optimal strategy for worker-and-task assignments, over both
present and predicted task/worker locations, such that the total assignment
quality score is maximized under the constraint of the traveling budget. In
this paper, we design an effective grid-based prediction method to estimate
spatial distributions of workers/tasks in the future, and then utilize the
predicted ones in our procedure of task assignments. We prove that the PB-SC
problem is NP-hard, and thus intractable. Therefore, we propose efficient
approximate algorithms to tackle the PB-SC problem, including greedy and
divide-and-conquer (D&C) approaches, which can efficiently assign workers to
spatial tasks with high quality scores and low budget consumptions, by
considering both current and future task/worker distributions. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our

of n binary digits where the integrand depends on input integers x[k] given in
binary radix, is equivalent to counting the number of equal-sum partitions of
the integers and is thus a #P problem. Similarly, integrating this function
from zero to infinity and deciding whether the result is either zero or
infinity is an NP-Complete problem. Efficient numerical integration methods
such as the double exponential formula and the sinc approximation have been
around since the mid 70's. Noting the hardness of approximating the integral we
argue that the proven rates of convergence of such methods cannot possibly be
correct since they give rise to an anomalous result as P=#P.

communications, image processing and animation, etc. An Ordinary Differential
Equation (ODE) is a differential equation if it involves derivatives with
respect to only one independent variable which can be studied from different
perspectives, such as: analytical methods, graphical methods and numerical
methods. This research paper therefore revises the standard Runge - Kutta
fourth order algorithm by using compiler techniques to dynamically evaluate the
inputs and implement the algorithm for both first and second order derivatives
of the ODE. We have been able to develop and implement the software that can be
used to evaluate inputs and compute solutions (approximately and analytically)
for the ODE function at a more efficient rate than the traditional method.

high bias regime, and study the effects of environmentally-induced elastic and
inelastic scattering on charge current in single molecule junctions, focusing
on high-bias effects. The probe technique phenomenologically incorporates
incoherent elastic and inelastic effects to the fully coherent case, mimicking
a rich physical environment at trivial cost. We further identify
environmentally-induced mechanisms which generate an asymmetry in the current,
manifested as a weak diode behavior. This rectifying behavior, found in two
types of molecular junction models, is absent in the coherent-elastic limit,
and is only active in the case with incoherent-inelastic scattering. Our work
illustrates that in the low bias - linear response regime, the commonly used
""dephasing probe"" (mimicking only elastic decoherence effects) operates nearly
indistinguishably from a ""voltage probe"" (admitting inelastic-dissipative
effects). However, these probes realize fundamentally distinct $I$-$V$
characteristics at high biases, reflecting the central roles of dissipation and
inelastic scattering processes on molecular electronic transport
far-from-equilibrium.

during its entire 8-month outburst using the Large Area Counter (LAC) onboard
the Ginga satellite. Recently, we obtained accurate estimates of the mass of
the black hole primary, the orbital inclination angle of the system, and the
distance. Using these crucial input data and Ginga X-ray spectra, we have
measured the spin of the black hole using the continuum-fitting method. For
four X-ray spectra of extraordinary quality we have determined the
dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a/M = 0.63 (-0.19, +0.16)
(1 sigma confidence level), a result that we confirm using eleven additional
spectra of lower quality. Our spin estimate challenges two published results:
It is somewhat higher than the value predicted by a proposed relationship
between jet power and spin; and we find that the spin of the black hole is
decidedly prograde, not retrograde as has been claimed.

and our precise determination of the disk component of emission obtained using
our $simultaneous$ photometric and spectroscopic data, have allowed us to
identify and accurately model archival ellipsoidal light curves of the highest

thermal models of buildings that could enable wide-scale deployment of
cost-effective predictive controls. An Unscented Kalman Filter augmented for
parameter and disturbance estimation is shown to accurately learn and predict a
building's thermal response. Recent studies of heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems have shown significant energy savings with advanced
model predictive control (MPC). A scalable cost-effective method to readily
acquire accurate, robust models of individual buildings' unique thermal
envelopes has historically been elusive and hindered the widespread deployment
of prediction-based control systems. Continuous commissioning and lifetime
performance of these thermal models requires deployment of on-line data-driven
system identification and parameter estimation routines. We propose a novel
gray-box approach using an Unscented Kalman Filter based on a multi-zone
thermal network and validate it with EnergyPlus simulation data. The filter
quickly learns parameters of a thermal network during periods of known or
constrained loads and then characterizes unknown loads in order to provide
accurate 24+ hour energy predictions. This study extends our initial
investigation by formalizing parameter and disturbance estimation routines and
demonstrating results across a year-long study.
