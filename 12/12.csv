$\kappa_\parallel$ and $\kappa_\perp$, in a strong magnetic field $B$ along the
directions parallel and perpendicular to $B$, respectively, at the leading
order in QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$. We consider a regime relevant for
the relativistic heavy ion collisions, $\alpha_s eB\ll T^2\ll eB$, so that
thermal excitations of light quarks are restricted to the lowest Landau level
(LLL) states. In the vanishing light-quark mass limit, we find
$\kappa_\perp^{\rm LO}\propto \alpha_s^2 T eB$ in the leading order that arises
from screened Coulomb scatterings with (1+1)-dimensional LLL quarks, while
$\kappa_\parallel$ gets no contribution from the scatterings with LLL quarks
due to kinematic restrictions. We show that the first non-zero leading order
contributions to $\kappa_\parallel^{\rm LO}$ come from the two separate
effects: 1) the screened Coulomb scatterings with thermal gluons, and 2) a
finite light-quark mass $m_q$. The former leads to $\kappa_\parallel^{\rm
LO,\,gluon} \propto \alpha_s^2 T^3$ and the latter to $\kappa_\parallel^{\rm
LO,\,massive}\propto \alpha_s (\alpha_s eB)^{1/2} m_q^2$. Based on our results,
we propose a new scenario for the large value of heavy-quark elliptic flow
observed in RHIC and LHC. Namely, when $\kappa_\perp\gg\kappa_\parallel$, an
anisotropy in drag forces gives rise to a sizable amount of the heavy-quark
elliptic flow even if heavy quarks do not fully belong to an ellipsoidally
expanding background fluid.

Additionally we compare single phase grains and bits having a bilayer structure
with graded Curie temperature, consisting of a hard magnetic layer with high
$T_{\mathrm{C}}$ and a soft magnetic one with low $T_{\mathrm{C}}$,
respectively. To describe the whole write process as realistic as possible a
distribution of the grain sizes and Curie temperatures, a displacement jitter
of the head and the bit positions are considered. For all these cases we
calculate bit error rates of various grain patterns, temperatures and write
head positions to optimize the achievable areal storage density. Within our

reaches the best results, and thus having the highest potential to become the

considerable number of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the light curves of
solar flares. This study continues our investigation into the possibility to
invert the measured periods $P$ and damping times $\tau$ of sausage modes to
deduce the transverse Alfv\'en time $R/v_{\rm Ai}$, density contrast $\rho_{\rm
i}/\rho_{\rm e}$, and the steepness of the density distribution transverse to
flare loops. A generic dispersion relation (DR) governing linear sausage modes
is derived for pressureless cylinders where density inhomogeneity of arbitrary
form takes place within the cylinder. We show that in general the inversion
problem is under-determined for QPP events where only a single sausage mode
exists, be the measurements spatially resolved or unresolved. While $R/v_{\rm
Ai}$ can be inferred to some extent, the range of possible steepness parameters
may be too broad to be useful. However, for spatially resolved measurements
where an additional mode is present, it is possible to deduce self-consistently
$\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm e}$, the profile steepness, and the internal Alfv\'en
speed $v_{\rm Ai}$. We show that at least for a recent QPP event that involves
a fundamental kink mode in addition to a sausage one, flare loop parameters are
well constrained, even if the specific form of the transverse density
distribution remains unknown. We conclude that spatially resolved, multi-mode
QPP measurements need to be pursued for inferring flare loop parameters.

reformulation enables us to change the original non-Abelian gauge field into
the new field variables such that one of them called the restricted field gives

the minimal option, especially, the restricted field is non-Abelian $U(2)$ and

magnetic-monopole dominance in addition to the restricted non-Abelian field
dominance for quark confinement supporting the non-Abelian dual
superconductivity using the minimal option for the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory.
This should be compared with the maximal option which is a gauge invarient
version of the Abelian projection in the maximal Abelian gauge: the restricted
field is Abelian $U(1) \times U(1)$ and involves only the Abelian magnetic
monopole, just like the Abelian projection.

maximal and minimal options of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory for quark confinement

Quantum-interference phenomena, such as Young's double slit experiment, are one
of the clearest manifestations of nonlocality, recently addressed as
$dynamical$ to specify its origin in the quantum equations of motion. It is
well known that loss of dynamical nonlocality can occur due to (partial)
collapse of the wavefunction due to a measurement, such as which-path
detection. However, alternative mechanisms affecting dynamical nonlocality have
hardly been considered, although of crucial importance in many schemes for
quantum information processing. Here, we present a fundamentally different
pathway of losing dynamical nonlocality, demonstrating that the detailed
geometry of the detection scheme is crucial to preserve nonlocality. By means
of a solid-state quantum-interference experiment we quantify this effect in a
diffusive system. We show that interference is not only affected by
decoherence, but also by a loss of dynamical nonlocality based on a local
reduction of the number of quantum conduction channels of the interferometer.
With our measurements and theoretical model we demonstrate that this mechanism
is an intrinsic property of quantum dynamics. Understanding the geometrical
constraints protecting nonlocality is crucial when designing quantum networks
for quantum information processing.

a heat flow is established, via the central system, in between the two baths.
The GLE-2B (GLE two baths) scheme permits us to have a realistic description of
both the dissipative central system and its surrounding baths. Following the
original GLE approach, the extended Langevin dynamics scheme is modified to
take into account two sets of auxiliary degrees of freedom corresponding to the
mapping of the vibrational properties of each bath. These auxiliary variables
are then used to solve the non-Markovian dissipative dynamics of the central
region. The resulting algorithm is used to study a model of a short Al nanowire
connected to two baths. The results of the simulations using the GLE-2B
approach are compared to the results of other simulations that were carried out
using standard thermostatting approaches (based on Markovian Langevin and
Nose-Hoover thermostats). We concentrate on the steady state regime and study
the establishment of a local temperature profile within the system. The
conditions for obtaining a flat profile or a temperature gradient are examined
in detail, in agreement with earlier studies. The results show that the GLE-2B
approach is able to treat, within a single scheme, two widely different thermal
transport regimes, i.e. ballistic systems, with no temperature gradient, and
diffusive systems with a temperature gradient.

which depends on two parameters. In contrast to the usual definition, our
proposal takes into account that each site of the lattice can be associated
with a local temperature which depends on the local environment of each site.
Using the generalised voter motel as a test case, we analyse the phase diagram
and the critical exponents in the stationary state and compare the results of
the standard order-parameter with the ones following from our new proposal, on
the honeycomb lattice. The stationary phase transition is in the Ising
universality class. Finite-size corrections are also studied and the Wegner
exponent is estimated as $\omega=1.06(9)$.

important role in the study of extended quantum systems out of equilibrium, in
particular in so-called generalized Gibbs ensembles. In this paper, we
rigorously study pseudolocal charges and their involvement in time evolutions
and in the thermalization process of arbitrary states with strong enough
clustering properties. We show that the densities of pseudolocal charges form a
Hilbert space, with inner product determined by thermodynamic susceptibilities.
Using this, we define the family of pseudolocal states, which are determined by
pseudolocal charges. This family includes thermal Gibbs states at high enough
temperatures, as well as (a precise definition of) generalized Gibbs ensembles.
We prove that the family of pseudolocal states is preserved by finite time
evolution, and that, under certain conditions, the stationary state emerging at
infinite time is a generalized Gibbs ensemble with respect to the evolution
dynamics. If the evolution dynamics does not admit any conserved pseudolocal
charges other than the evolution Hamiltonian, we show that any stationary
pseudolocal state with respect to this dynamics is a thermal Gibbs state, and
that Gibbs thermalization occurs. The framework is that of
translation-invariant states on hypercubic quantum lattices of any
dimensionality (including quantum chains) and finite-range Hamiltonians, and
does not involve integrability.

MRI-driven turbulence comprises two components: the large-scale shear-aligned
strong magnetic field and the small-scale fluctuations resembling
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The energy spectrum of the large-scale
component is close to $k^{-2}$, whereas the spectrum of the small-scale
component agrees with the spectrum of strong MHD turbulence $k^{-3/2}$. While
the spectrum of the fluctuations is universal, the outer-scale characteristics
of the turbulence are not; they depend on the parameters of the system, such as
the net magnetic flux. However, there is remarkable universality among the
allowed turbulent states -- their intensity $v_0$ and their outer scale
$\lambda_0$ satisfy the balance condition $v_0/\lambda_0\sim \mathrm
d\Omega/\mathrm d\ln r$, where $\mathrm d\Omega/\mathrm d\ln r$ is the local
orbital shearing rate of the flow. Finally, we find no sustained dynamo action

$45\,000$, casting doubts on the existence of an MRI dynamo in the

system, that reveal two remarkable dimming events. These events are similar to
that which we observed in 2010-2011, which was the first such deep dimming
observed in RW Aur in a century's worth of photometric monitoring. We suggested
the 2010-2011 dimming was the result of an occultation of the star by its
tidally disrupted circumstellar disk. In 2012-2013, the RW Aur system dimmed by
~0.7 mag for ~40 days and in 2014/2015 the system dimmed by ~2 mag for >250
days. The ingress/egress duration measurements of the more recent events agree
well with those from the 2010-2011 event, providing strong evidence that the
new dimmings are kinematically associated with the same occulting source.
Therefore, we suggest that both the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 dimming events,
measured using data from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope and the
Kutztown University Observatory, are also occultations of RW Aur A by tidally
disrupted circumstellar material. Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the
eccentric fly-by of RW Aur B suggest the occulting body to be a bridge of
material connecting RW Aur A and B. These simulations suggest the possibility
of additional occultations, supported by the observations presented in this
work. The color evolution of the dimmings suggest that the tidally stripped
disk material includes dust grains ranging in size from small grains at the
leading edge, typical of star forming regions, to large grains, ices or pebbles
producing grey or nearly grey extinction deeper within the occulting material.
It is not known whether this material represents arrested planet building prior
to the tidal disruption event, or perhaps accelerated planet building as a
result of the disruption event, but in any case the evidence suggests the
presence of advanced planet building material in the space between RW Aur A and
B.

decades, combined with a net migration flow from rural villages to urban
agglomerations. While it is clear that the rate of natural increase and
migration flows are the driving forces shaping the spatial distribution of
population, a general consensus on the mechanisms that characterise the
urbanisation process is still lacking. Here we present two fundamental laws of
urbanisation that are quantitatively supported by empirical evidence: 1) the
number of cities in a country is proportional to the country's total
population, irrespective of the country's area, and 2) the average distance
between cities scales as the inverse of the square root of the country's
population density. We study the spatio-temporal evolution of population

in which 'neighbourhood size', that is the effective local population density,

embedded in a spatial version of the ancestral selection graph and through
applying a diffusive scaling to this object we show that whereas in dimensions
at least three, selection is barely impeded by the spatial structure, in the
most relevant dimension, $d=2$, selection must be stronger (by a factor of
$\log(1/\mu)$ where $\mu$ is the neutral mutation rate) if we are to have a
chance of detecting it. The case $d=1$ was handled in Etheridge et al. (2015).
  The mathematical interest is that although the system of branching and
coalescing lineages that forms the ancestral selection graph converges to a
branching Brownian motion, this reflects a delicate balance of a branching rate
that grows to infinity and the instant annullation of almost all branches
through coalescence caused by the strong local competition in the population.

constrain such models by the weak gravity conjecture for domain walls: While
the electric side of the conjecture is always satisfied if the
cosine-oscillations of the axion potential are sufficiently small, the magnetic
side imposes a cutoff, $\Lambda^3 \sim m f M_{pl}$, independent of the height
of these `wiggles'. We compare our approach with the recent related proposal by
Ibanez, Montero, Uranga and Valenzuela. We also discuss the non-trivial
question which version, if any, of the weak gravity conjecture for domain walls
should hold. In particular, we show that string compactifications with branes
of different dimensions wrapped on different cycles lead to a `geometric weak
gravity conjecture' relating volumes of cycles, norms of corresponding forms
and the volume of the compact space. Imposing this `geometric conjecture',
e.g.~on the basis of the more widely accepted weak gravity conjecture for

forefront of modern data analysis. In many applications data are correlated, so
that the observed test statistic used for detecting a non-null case, or signal,
at each location in a dataset carries some information about the chances of a
true signal at other locations. Brown, Lazar, Datta, Jang, and McDowell (2014)
proposed in the neuroimaging context a Bayesian multiple testing model that
accounts for the dependence of each volume element on the behavior of its
neighbors through a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Here, we propose a
generalized CAR model that allows for inclusion of points with no neighbors at
all, something that is not possible under conventional CAR models. We consider
also neighborhoods based on criteria other than physical location, such as
genetic pathways in microarray determined from existing biological knowledge.
This generalization provides a unified framework for the simultaneous modeling
of dependent and independent cases, resulting in stronger Bayesian learning in
the posterior and increased precision in the estimates of interesting signals.
We justify the selected prior distribution and prove that the resulting
posterior distribution is proper. We illustrate the effectiveness and
applicability of our proposed model by using it to analyze both simulated and
real microarray data in which the genes exhibit dependence that is determined
by physical adjacency on a chromosome or predefined gene pathways.

  analysis?",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flexibility is often claimed as a competitive advantage when proposing new
network designs. However, most proposals provide only qualitative arguments for
their improved support of flexibility. Quantitative arguments vary a lot among
different proposals. A general understanding for flexibility is not yet clearly
defined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions based on
background information. The term flexibility is commonly defined as the ability
to adapt to changes. For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to
adapt the available network resources, such as flows or topology, to changes of
design requirements, e.g., shorter latency budgets or different traffic
distributions. Recent concepts such as Software Defined Networking, Network
Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization have emerged claiming to
provide more flexibility in networks. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of
what flexibility means and how it could be quantified to compare different
network designs remains open. In this paper, we ask whether flexibility can be
a new measure for network design space analysis. As it is quite challenging to
formulate a flexibility measure that covers all network aspects, we propose an
initial set of flexibility aspects to start grounding guidelines. Our initial
selection is backed up by an analysis of Software Defined Networking, Network
Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization for their support of the
selected flexibility aspects. Our research methodology is based on a systematic
approach that leads to network design guidelines with respect to flexibility.

cosmological distances. The derived brightness temperatures exceed by many
orders of magnitude the self-absorption limit of incoherent synchrotron
radiation, implying the operation of a coherent emission process. We propose a
radiation mechanism for fast radio bursts where the emission arises from
collisionless Bremsstrahlung in strong plasma turbulence excited by
relativistic electron beams. We discuss possible astrophysical scenarios in
which this process might operate. The emitting region is a turbulent plasma hit
by a relativistic jet, where Langmuir plasma waves produce a concentration of
intense electrostatic soliton-like regions (cavitons). The resulting radiation
is coherent and, under some physical conditions, can be polarised and have a
power-law distribution in energy. We obtain radio luminosities in agreement
with the inferred values for fast radio bursts. The timescale of the radio
flare in some cases can be extremely fast, of the order of $10^{-3}$ s. The
mechanism we present here can explain the main features of fast radio bursts
and is plausible in different astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts
and some Active Galactic Nuclei.

standard the Hamiltonian and model space of the shell model Monte Carlo
calculations. Two examples are considered: the nucleus $^{162}$Dy, representing
a heavy deformed nucleus, and $^{148}$Sm, representing a nearby heavy spherical
nucleus with strong pairing correlations. The errors inherent in the
finite-temperature Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations are
analyzed by comparing the entropies of the grand canonical and canonical
ensembles, as well as the level density at the neutron resonance threshold,
with shell model Monte Carlo (SMMC) calculations, which are accurate up to
well-controlled statistical errors. The main weak points in the mean-field
treatments are seen to be: (i) the extraction of number-projected densities
from the grand canonical ensembles, and (ii) the symmetry breaking by
deformation or by the pairing condensate. In the absence of a pairing
condensate, we confirm that the usual saddle-point approximation to extract the
number-projected densities is not a significant source of error compared to
other errors inherent to the mean-field theory. We also present an alternative
formulation of the saddle-point approximation that makes direct use of an
approximate particle-number projection and avoids computing the usual
three-dimensional Jacobian of the saddle-point integration. We find that the
pairing condensate is less amenable to approximate particle-number projection
methods due to the explicit violation of particle-number conservation in the
pairing condensate. Nevertheless, the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory is
accurate to less than one unit of entropy for $^{148}$Sm at the neutron
threshold energy, which is above the pairing phase transition.

that the striations are connected with the main clumps and likely to contain

Dimensions) model admits phenomenologically viable solutions with 4D maximal
symmetry. We take into account a finite brane width and a scale invariance (SI)
breaking dilaton-brane coupling, both of which should be included in a
realistic setup. Provided that the microscopic size of the brane is not tuned
much smaller than the fundamental bulk Planck length, we find that either the
4D curvature or the size of the extra dimensions is unacceptably large. Since
this result is independent of the dilaton-brane couplings, it provides the
biggest challenge to the SLED program.
  In addition, to clarify its potential with respect to the cosmological
constant problem, we infer the amount of tuning on model parameters required to
obtain a sufficiently small 4D curvature. A first answer was recently given in
[arXiv:1508.01124], showing that 4D flat solutions are only ensured in the SI
case by imposing a tuning relation, even if a brane-localized flux is included.
In this companion paper, we find that the tuning can in fact be avoided for
certain SI breaking brane-dilaton couplings, but only at the price of worsening
the phenomenological problem.
  Our results are obtained by solving the full coupled Einstein-dilaton system
in a completely consistent way. The brane width is implemented using a
well-known ring regularization. In passing, we note that for the couplings
considered here the results of [arXiv:1508.01124] (which only treated
infinitely thin branes) are all consistently recovered in the thin brane limit,
and how this can be reconciled with the concerns about their correctness,
recently brought up in [arXiv:1509.04201].

remain under control. For this purpose we require the perturbed action up to

to gluino and squarks of the first two generations, or to charm-squarks. In the
absence of extra structure, the mass of the gluino provides an additional
source of fine tuning and is therefore important to consider within models of
flavored naturalness that allow for relatively light squark states. When
combining the searches, the resulting constraints in the plane of the lightest
squark and gluino masses are rather stable with respect to the presence of
flavor-violation, and do not allow for gluino masses of less than 1.2 TeV and
squarks lighter than about 550 GeV. While these constraints are stringent,
interesting models with sizable stop-scharm mixing and a relatively light

accreted since their formation epoch. For this reason, their matter content
should be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon
fraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction. We make use of the
sample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to
investigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the
cluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a
mass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements
for a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the
weak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially
lower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit
relation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\rm
gas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\left(M_{\rm
500}/10^{14}M_\odot\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. The baryon budget of galaxy
clusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a
factor of two at $r_{\rm 500}$. Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias
$1-b=M_X/M_{\rm WL}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtained
using lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. Comparing our gas fraction
measurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our results
favour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the
baryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in
contrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might
suggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias
$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should
translate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to
our current understanding of galaxy clusters. [Abridged]

multipole moments of the Kerr spacetime and completely determine all

tested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such
higher-order moments. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for precision

spectrum. First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A*
with current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital

and deep inside the cell of uniformity. At these scales, we consider the
Universe to be filled with dust-like matter in the form of discretely
distributed galaxies, a minimally coupled scalar field and radiation as matter
sources. We investigate such a Universe in the mechanical approach. This means
that the peculiar velocities of the inhomogeneities (in the form of galaxies)
as well as fluctuations of other perfect fluids are non-relativistic. Such
fluids are designated as coupled because they are concentrated around
inhomogeneities. In the present paper we investigate the conditions under which
a scalar field can become coupled, and show that, at the background level, such
coupled scalar field behaves as a two component perfect fluid: a network of
frustrated cosmic strings with EoS parameter $w=-1/3$ and a cosmological
constant. The potential of this scalar field is very flat at the present time.
Hence, the coupled scalar field can provide the late cosmic acceleration. The
fluctuations of the energy density and pressure of this field are concentrated
around the galaxies screening their gravitational potentials. Therefore, such
scalar fields can be regarded as coupled to the inhomogeneities.

body code GADGET-3 in the context of isolated or cosmological direct baryonic
collapse within dark matter (DM) halos to form supermassive black holes. Gas
flow is examined by following evolution of basic parameters of accretion flows.
Both codes show an overall agreement in the general features of the collapse,
however, many subtle differences exist. For isolated models, the codes increase
their spatial and mass resolutions at different pace, which leads to
substantially earlier collapse in SPH than in AMR cases due to higher
gravitational resolution in GADGET-3. In cosmological runs, the AMR develops a
slightly higher baryonic resolution than SPH during halo growth via cold
accretion permeated by mergers. Still, both codes agree in the buildup of DM
and baryonic structures. However, with the onset of collapse, this difference
in mass and spatial resolution is amplified, so evolution of SPH models begins
to lag behind. Such a delay can have effect on formation/destruction rate of H2
due to UV background, and on basic properties of host halos. Finally, isolated
non-cosmological models in spinning halos, with spin parameter {\lambda} ~ 0.01
- 0.07, show delayed collapse for greater {\lambda}, but pace of this increase
is faster for AMR. Within our simulation setup, GADGET-3 requires significantly
larger computational resources than Enzo- 2.4 during collapse, and needs
similar resources, during the pre-collapse, cosmological structure formation
phase. Yet it benefits from substantially higher gravitational force and
hydrodynamic resolutions, except at the end of collapse.

thermodynamic notions in the quantum regime. This applies both to the study of
notions of work extraction in thermal machines in the quantum regime, as well
as to questions of equilibration and thermalisation of interacting quantum
many-body systems as such. In this work we bring together these two lines of
research by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a
sequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions.
In this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics
of quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be
well described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable
equilibrium state. We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i)
the time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised
Gibbs ensemble (GGE), reflecting further constants of motion in integrable
models. For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy
production, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of
optimal work extraction protocols. While we keep the discussion general, much
room is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic
quantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with
respect to the role of the minimal work principle. Our work not only has
implications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as
suggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external
heat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of
freedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium.

particularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient
circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the
derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely
ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the
binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to
higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set.
Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only
$1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than
previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth
of only $O(\log\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on
two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic
circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of
non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections
further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the
non-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\rangle \mapsto |i, j + \delta_{i,2} \mod
3\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate
$P_9=\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \pi \, i/9},1,e^{2 \pi \, i/9})$. The two choices of
elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different
prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and
the supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to
factor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary
finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be
implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis.

enhanced magnetic activity, but they are not usually rooted in the dark umbrae
of sunspots because the strong magnetic field found there suppresses
convection. This means that the Poynting flux of magnetic energy into the upper
atmosphere is not significant within the umbra as long as there are no light
bridges or umbral dots. Here we report a rare observation of a coronal loop
rooted in the dark umbra of a sunspot without any traces of light bridges or
umbral dots. We used the slit-jaw images and spectroscopic data from IRIS and
concentrate on the line profiles of O IV and Si IV that show persistent strong
redshifted components in the loop rooted in the umbra. Using the ratios of O
IV, we can estimate the density and thus investigate the mass flux. The coronal
context and temperature diagnostics of these observations is provided through
the EUV channels of AIA. The coronal loop, embedded within cooler downflows,
hosts supersonic downflows. The speed of more than 100 km s$^{-1}$ is on the
same order of magnitude in the transition region lines of O IV and Si IV, and
is even seen at comparable speed in the chromospheric Mg II lines. At a
projected distance of within $1""$ of the footpoint, we see a shock transition
to smaller downflow speeds of about 15 km s$^{-1}$ being consistent with mass
conservation across a stationary isothermal shock. We see no direct evidence
for energy input into the loop because the loop is rooted in the dark uniform
part of the umbra with no light bridges or umbral dots near by. Thus one might
conclude that we are seeing a siphon flow driven from the footpoint at the
other end of the loop. However, for a final result data of similar quality at
the other footpoint are needed, but this is too far away to be covered by the
IRIS field of view.

series of XXL papers focusing on the bright cluster sample. We investigate the
luminosity-temperature (LT) relation for the brightest clusters detected in the
XXL Survey, taking fully into account the selection biases. We investigate the
form of the LT relation, placing constraints on its evolution. We have
classified the 100 brightest clusters in the XXL Survey based on their measured
X-ray flux. These 100 clusters have been analysed to determine their luminosity
and temperature to evaluate the LT relation. We used three methods to fit the
LT relation, with two of these methods providing a prescription to fully take
into account the selection effects of the survey. We measure the evolution of
the LT relation internally using the broad redshift range of the sample. Taking
into account selection effects, we find a slope of the bolometric LT relation
of B$_{\rm LT}=3.08\pm$0.15, steeper than the self-similar expectation (B$_{\rm
LT}$=2). Our best-fit result for the evolution factor is $E(z)^{1.64\pm0.77}$,
consistent with ""strong self-similar"" evolution where clusters scale
self-similarly with both mass and redshift. However, this result is marginally
stronger than ""weak self-similar"" evolution, where clusters scale with redshift
alone. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to the assumptions made in
our model, finding that using an external LT relation as a low-z baseline can
have a profound effect on the measured evolution. However, more clusters are
needed to break the degeneracy between the choice of likelihood model and
mass-temperature relation on the derived evolution.

to gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before
reionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple
arguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in
local abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have
important consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely
metal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost
immediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is
too low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars
may contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in
large carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)
can be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling
abundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard
core-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We
also show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in
these species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are
correlated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local
silicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure
SNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,
preferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)
dust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio
fluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light
element abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust
where they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis.

disk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.
In this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporal
variations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. We used a
Gaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, to
separate in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane a clean disk star subsample from the
Gaia-ESO survey internal data release 2. We find that the sample is separated
into five groups associated with major Galactic components; the metal-rich end
of the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.
This is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. The two
metal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition
([Fe/H]>-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. This
holds true at different radial regions. The distribution of Galactocentric
radial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([Fe/H]<-0.25 dex) is
shifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. Moreover,
the metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale height
intermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and it
displays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. These stars might have
formed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formation
taking place in the internal thin disk. Their enhancement levels might be due
to their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or the
inner halo. The smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distribution
with respect to the plane, in particular) with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] suggested by
the data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.

two box sizes (67 Mpc and 349 Mpc), each with two grid resolutions. This suite

optical depth of the cosmic microwave background and the neutral fraction and

redshifted 21-cm emission in anticipation of upcoming radio interferometer
observations. We find that the overall shape of the 21-cm signal and various

for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio networks in which FD secondary users (SUs)
perform channel contention followed by concurrent spectrum sensing and
transmission, and transmission only with maximum power in two different stages
(called the FD sensing and transmission stages, respectively) in each
contention and access cycle. The proposed FD cognitive MAC (FDC-MAC) protocol
does not require synchronization among SUs and it efficiently utilizes the
spectrum and mitigates the self-interference in the FD transceiver. We then
develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the
FDC-MAC protocol where both half-duplex (HD) transmission (HDTx) and FD
transmission (FDTx) modes are considered in the transmission stage. Then, we
study the FDC-MAC configuration optimization through adaptively controlling the
spectrum sensing duration and transmit power level in the FD sensing stage
where we prove that there exists optimal sensing time and transmit power to
achieve the maximum throughput and we develop an algorithm to configure the
proposed FDC-MAC protocol. Extensive numerical results are presented to
illustrate the characteristic of the optimal FDC-MAC configuration and the
impacts of protocol parameters and the self-interference cancellation quality
on the throughput performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the significant
throughput gains of the FDC-MAC protocol with respect to existing half-duplex
MAC (HD MAC) and single-stage FD MAC protocols.

be formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons. To evaluate the
feasibility of such a deep neural network architecture for feature learning and
extraction, we train deep convolutional StochasticNets to learn abstract
features using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and extract the learned features from
images to perform classification on the SVHN and STL-10 datasets. Experimental
results show that features learned using deep convolutional StochasticNets,
with fewer neural connections than conventional deep convolutional neural
networks, can allow for better or comparable classification accuracy than
conventional deep neural networks: relative test error decrease of ~4.5% for
classification on the STL-10 dataset and ~1% for classification on the SVHN

convolutional StochasticNets can provide comparable classification accuracy
even when only 10% of the training data is used for feature learning. Finally,
it was also shown that significant gains in feature extraction speed can be
achieved in embedded applications using StochasticNets. As such, StochasticNets
allow for faster feature learning and extraction performance while facilitate

bottleneck for the entire system if its serviceability and the capacity is over
utilized by increased service demand from upstream systems. From all the
integrated sub-systems, queuing systems are majorly categorized as choking
elements due to their limited service length and lack of processing details.
The situation becomes more pronounced in multiprogramming environments where
the queue performance exponentially degrades with increased degree of
multiprogramming at upstream levels. This paper presents an approach to compute
the queue length and devise a distribution model such that the queue length is
dynamically adjusted depending on the sudden growth or decline of transmission

the queue length distribution. With each degree of multi-programmability, the

Our physical model allows to investigate the balance between the formation of
winds and accretion simultaneously. Radiation-driven winds are allowed by
taking into account radiation pressure due to UV and IR radiation along with
X-ray heating and dust sublimation. Accretion is allowed through angular
momentum transport and the solution of the equations of radiation
hydrodynamics. Our methods adopt flux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics
for the dusty, infrared pressure driven part of the flow, along with X-ray
heating and cooling. Angular momentum transport in the accreting part of the
flow is modeled using effective viscosity. Our results demonstrate that
radiation pressure on dust can play an important role in shaping AGN
obscuration. For example, when the luminosity illuminating the torus exceeds
$L>0.01\,L_{\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity, we find
no episodes of sustained disk accretion because radiation pressure does not
allow a disk to form. Despite the absence of the disk accretion, the flow of
gas to smaller radii still proceeds at a rate $10^{-4}-10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$ through the capturing of the gas from the hot evaporative flow, thus
providing a mechanism to deliver gas from a radiation-pressure dominated torus
to the inner accretion disk. As $L/L_{\rm edd}$ increases, larger radiation
input leads to larger torus aspect ratios and increased obscuration of the
central black hole. We also find the important role of the X-ray heated gas in
shaping of the obscuring torus.

is able to carry the magnetic moment if the ground state of the QD is a
magnetic doublet. In this sense, the Andreev energy levels play a role of
effective impurity levels. When the normal lead is coupled to the QD-S system,
on the one hand, the Andreev energy levels broaden to form the so-called
Andreev bound states (ABSs), on the other hand, it can screen the magnetic
moment of the ABSs. By tuning the couplings between the QD and the normal
(superconducting) leads, the ABSs can simulate the Kondo, mixed-valence, and
even empty orbit regimes of the usual single-impurity Anderson model. The above
picture is confirmed by the Green's function calculation of the hybrid N-QD-S
Anderson model and is also able to explain qualitatively experimental phenomena
observed by Deacon \textit{et al.}. These results can further stimulate related
experimental study in the N-QD-S systems.

area of 50deg$^2$, the survey contains $\sim450$ galaxy clusters out to a
redshift $\sim$2 and to an X-ray flux limit of
$\sim5\times10^{-15}erg\,s^{-1}cm^{-2}$. This paper is part of the first
release of XXL results focussed on the bright cluster sample. We investigate
the scaling relation between weak-lensing mass and X-ray temperature for the
brightest clusters in XXL. The scaling relation is used to estimate the mass of
all 100 clusters in XXL-100-GC. Based on a subsample of 38 objects that lie
within the intersection of the northern XXL field and the publicly available
CFHTLenS catalog, we derive the $M_{WL}$ of each system with careful
considerations of the systematics. The clusters lie at $0.1<z<0.6$ and span a
range of $ T\simeq1-5keV$. We combine our sample with 58 clusters from the
literature, increasing the range out to 10keV. To date, this is the largest
sample of clusters with $M_{WL}$ measurements that has been used to study the
mass-temperature relation. The fit ($M\propto T^b$) to the XXL clusters returns
a slope $b=1.78^{+0.37}_{-0.32}$ and intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\ln
M|T}\simeq0.53$; the scatter is dominated by disturbed clusters. The fit to the
combined sample of 96 clusters is in tension with self-similarity,
$b=1.67\pm0.12$ and $\sigma_{\ln M|T}\simeq0.41$. Overall our results
demonstrate the feasibility of ground-based weak-lensing scaling relation
studies down to cool systems of $\sim1keV$ temperature and highlight that the
current data and samples are a limit to our statistical precision. As such we
are unable to determine whether the validity of hydrostatic equilibrium is a
function of halo mass. An enlarged sample of cool systems, deeper weak-lensing
data, and robust modelling of the selection function will help to explore these
issues further.

  Covariant Logic of Domains: Domains are represented as sets of theories, and
Scott continuous functions are represented as input-output inference engines.
The questions addressed are: A. What constitutes a subdomain? Do subdomains of
a given domain $A$ form a domain? B. Which retractions are finitary? C. What is
the essence of generalizations of information systems based on non-reflexive
logics? Are these generalizations restricted to continuous domains?
  Analysis on Domains:
  D. How to describe Scott topologies via generalized distance functions

answer is that the axiom $\rho (x, x) = 0$ is incompatible with Scott
continuity of distance functions. The resulting \bf relaxed metrics are
studied.
  E. Is it possible to obtain Scott continuous relaxed metrics via measures of

polytope, the space of conformal blocks is isomorphic to a product of conformal
blocks over groups of lower rank. If the weights are on a degree zero wall,
then we also show that there is an isomorphism of conformal blocks bundles,
giving an explicit relation between the associated nef divisors. The methods of
the proof are geometric, and use the identification of conformal blocks with
spaces of generalized theta functions, and the moduli stacks of parahoric
bundles recently studied by Balaji and Seshadri.

produces inconsistent estimators when the dimensionality is moderate to high,

scalability and model interpretability are difficult to achieve, not to mention
the prevalence of missing values. While existing sparse PCA methods alleviate
inconsistency, they are constrained to the Gaussian assumption of classical PCA

the broad exponential family distributions under high-dimensional setup, with
built-in treatment for missing values. Meanwhile we propose a family of
iterative sparse generalized PCA (SG-PCA) algorithms such that despite the
non-convexity and non-smoothness of the optimization task, the loss function
decreases in every iteration. In terms of ease and intuitive parameter tuning,
our sparsity-inducing regularization is far superior to the popular Lasso.
Furthermore, to promote overall scalability, accelerated gradient is integrated
for fast convergence, while a progressive screening technique gradually
squeezes out nuisance dimensions of a large-scale problem for feasible
optimization. High-dimensional simulation and real data experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and efficacy of SG-PCA.

occurrence of weak but well defined superlattice peaks in the XRD pattern. This
structural transformation is of first order in nature as evident from the phase
coexistence across the transition region. These results thus clearly illustrate
that LPCMO undergoes a first order structural phase transition from charge

interoperability of reasoning between triples in various contexts. We call a
set of quads together with such expressive bridge rules, a quad-system. Query
answering over quad-systems is undecidable, in general. We derive decidable
classes of quad-systems, for which query answering can be done using forward
chaining. Sound, complete and terminating procedures, which are adaptations of
the well known chase algorithm, are provided for these classes for deciding
query entailment. Safe, msafe, and csafe class of quad-systems restrict the
structure of blank nodes generated during the chase computation process to be
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of bounded depth. RR and restricted RR classes
do not allow the generation of blank nodes during the chase computation
process. Both data and combined complexity of query entailment has been
established for the classes derived. We further show that quad-systems are
equivalent to forall-existential rules whose predicates are restricted to
ternary arity, modulo polynomial time translations. We subsequently show that
the technique of safety, strictly subsumes in expressivity, some of the well
known and expressive techniques, such as joint acyclicity and model faithful
acyclicity, used for decidability guarantees in the realm of forall-existential

for a subsample of 20 of the 100 brightest clusters in the XXL Survey observed
with WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). For the first time,
we have measured this relation via weak-lensing analysis down to $M_{500,WL}
=3.5 \times 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. This allows us to investigate whether the slope
of the $L_K-M$ relation is different for groups and clusters, as seen in other
works. The clusters in our sample span a wide range in mass, $M_{500,WL}
=0.35-12.10 \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, at $0<z<0.6$. The K-band luminosity
scales as $\log_{10}(L_{K,500}/10^{12}L_\odot) \propto \beta
log_{10}(M_{500,WL}/10^{14}M_\odot)$ with $\beta = 0.85^{+0.35}_{-0.27}$ and an
intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{lnL_K|M} =0.37^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. Combining our
sample with some clusters in the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS)
present in the literature, we obtain a slope of $1.05^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ and an
intrinsic scatter of $0.14^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. The flattening in the $L_K-M$ seen
in previous works is not seen here and might be a result of a bias in the mass
measurement due to assumptions on the dynamical state of the systems. We also
study the richness-mass relation and find that group-sized halos have more
galaxies per unit halo mass than massive clusters. However, the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG) in low-mass systems contributes a greater fraction to the
total cluster light than BCGs do in massive clusters; the luminosity gap
between the two brightest galaxies is more prominent for group-sized halos.
This result is a natural outcome of the hierarchical growth of structures,
where massive galaxies form and gain mass within low-mass groups and are
ultimately accreted into more massive clusters to become either part of the BCG
or one of the brighter galaxies. [Abridged]

corresponding flattenings on the dispersion relations $\omega (q)$ of lattice
vibrations. Slow phonons are created near the $N-S$ interface in quasiparticle
recombination and relaxation processes and cause a decrease in $\Delta $ and an
increase in the differential resistance in the vicinity of $e{{V}_{ph}}$. An
excess quasiparticle charge is accumulated in the region of the contact,
producing a correction to the resistance, which decreases as $eV$, $T$, and $H$
increase. These mechanisms are particularly effective in dirty contacts, thus
permitting phonon spectroscopy in the superconducting state even when the
current flow occurs in a nearly thermal mode.

function of galaxies contains only a monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole.
Looking at cross-correlations between different populations of galaxies, this
turns out not to be the case. In particular, the cross-correlations between a
bright and a faint population of galaxies contain also a dipole. In this paper
we present the first attempt to measure this dipole. We discuss the four types
of effects that contribute to the dipole: relativistic distortions, evolution
effect, wide-angle effect and large-angle effect. We show that the first three
contributions are intrinsic anti-symmetric contributions that do not depend on
the choice of angle used to measure the dipole. On the other hand the
large-angle effect appears only if the angle chosen to extract the dipole
breaks the symmetry of the problem. We show that the relativistic distortions,
the evolution effect and the wide-angle effect are too small to be detected in
the LOWz and CMASS sample of the BOSS survey. On the other hand with a specific
combination of angles we are able to measure the large-angle effect with high
significance. We emphasise that this large-angle dipole does not contain new
physical information, since it is just a geometrical combination of the
monopole and the quadrupole. However this measurement, which is in excellent
agreement with theoretical predictions, validates our method for extracting the
dipole from the two-point correlation function and it opens the way to the
detection of relativistic effects in future surveys like e.g. DESI.

calibration via correlation can be applied to any kind of calibration spectra

particles in the conventional lattice models are limited to discrete lattice
points. Moreover, each particle is spatially fixed at the distributed position,
which results in a temporally unchanged network structure. Although each
polymer in the chemical gels can spontaneously move in the continuous space,
the network structure is fixed when cross-linking reaction ends. By contrast to
these conventional systems, all the molecules in the present system freely move
and spontaneously diffuse in the continuous space. The network structure of the
present molecules continues changing dynamically. The percolation and critical
phenomena of such dynamic network structures are examined here. We reveal that
these phenomena also occur in the present system, and that both the
universality class and percolation threshold are independent from the
extra-molecular topological constraints.

  disturbances propagation in traffic flow",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a new approach that generalizes the existing
second-order hydrodynamic traffic models. In the proposed approach, we use the
expression for the relative velocity of disturbances propagation in traffic
flow. We show that properties of any phenomenological model are fully defined
by how the relative velocity of disturbances propagation expressed in the
model. We verify the proposed approach through simulations of the Interstate
580 freeway segment in California, USA, with traffic measurements from the
Performance Measurement System (PeMS).

second-order multilane traffic models. The focus is on calibrating the
fundamental diagram using the combination stationary detector data and GPS
traces. GPS traces are used in estimation of the deceleration wave speed. Thus
calibrated model adequately represents the three phases of traffic: free flow,
synchronized flow and the wide moving jam. The proposed approach was validated
in simulation using stationary detection data and GPS traces from the Moscow
Ring Road. Simulation showed that the proposed second-order model is more
accurate than the first-order LWR model.
