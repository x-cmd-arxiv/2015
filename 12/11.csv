mass as a measure of the quantity of matter and mass as a dynamical property. I
claim that the former is ill-defined, and the latter is only plausible with
respect to a metaphysical interpretation of laws of nature. I explore the
following options for the status of laws: Humeanism, primitivism about laws,
dispositionalism, and ontic structural realism.

junction limit, which has hitherto attracted less theoretical interest but has
recently become experimentally relevant. We use this computational approach to
study the dependence of the critical current on the junction geometry, doping
level, and an applied perpendicular magnetic field. In zero magnetic field we
find a good qualitative agreement with the recent experiment of Ben Shalom et
al. (Reference[12]) for the length dependence of the critical current. For
highly doped samples our numerical calculations show a broad agreement with the
results of the quasiclassical formalism. In this case the critical current
exhibits Fraunhofer-like oscillations as a function of the magnetic field.
However, for lower doping levels, where the cyclotron orbit becomes comparable
to the characteristic geometrical length scales of the system, deviations from
the results of the quasiclassical formalism appear. We argue that due to the
exceptional tunability and long mean free path of graphene systems a new regime
can be explored where geometrical and dynamical effects are equally important
to understand the magnetic field dependence of the critical current.

a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with its gaseous and stellar environment.
Simulations to determine the accretion of stellar winds from the surrounding
O-stars onto the black hole have been performed earlier, but in those the
presence of the S-star system was ignored. The S-stars are a group of young
massive B-stars in relatively close orbits around the black hole. Here we
simulate those stars in order to study their contribution to the accretion
rate, without taking the more distant and massive O-stars into account. We use
the Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment (AMUSE) to combine
gravitational physics, stellar evolution and hydrodynamics in a single
simulation of the S-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole, and use this
framework to determine the amount of gas that is accreted onto the black hole.
We find that the accretion rate is sensitive to the wind properties of the
S-stars (rate of mass-loss and terminal velocity). Our simulations are
consistent with the observed accretion rate of the black hole only if the stars
exhibit high wind massloss rates that are comparable with those of evolved 7-10
Myr old stars with masses of M=19-25 M_SUN. This is in contrast with
observations that have shown that these stars are rather young, main-sequence
B-stars. We therefore conclude that the S-stars cannot account for the
accretion rate alone.

same asymp-totic running time as the original non-uniform algorithm. Our method
applies to a wide family of both deterministic and randomized algorithms.
Specifically, it applies to almost all state of the art non-uniform algorithms

For instance, since the BSE reduces in second order to M{\o}ller-Plesset
perturbation theory, it is self-interaction free in second order. Results for
the correlatione energy are compared with Quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks and
excellent agreement is observed. For low densities, however, we find imaginary

eigenmodes, an approximation to the BSE kernel is proposed, which allows to
completely remove this issue in the low electron density region. We refer to

CVs with low-mass white dwarfs are driven into dynamically unstable mass
transfer due to consequential angular momentum loss (CAML). Indeed, assuming
CAML increases as a function of decreasing white dwarf mass can bring into
agreement the predictions of binary population models and the observed
properties of the CV population. We speculate that a common envelope like

Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnisky axion model in light of the recent Higgs LHC
results and electroweak precision data. This model is an extension of the
two-Higgs-doublet model incorporating a PQ symmetry which leads to a physically
acceptable axion. For generic values of the couplings, the model reproduces the
minimal Standard Model, with a massless axion and all the other degrees of
freedom at a very high scale. However, in some scenarios, the extra Higgses
could be relatively light. We use the oblique corrections, in particular
$\Delta\rho$, to constrain the mass spectrum in this case. Finally, we also
work out the non-linear parametrization of the DFSZ model in the generic case
where all scalars except the lightest Higgs and the axion have masses at or
beyond the TeV scale.
  In the second part, we study the relevance of a cold axion background (CAB)
as a responsible for the dark matter in the Universe and examine its
consequences through its effects on photon and cosmic ray propagation. We study
the axion-photon system under the joint influence of two backgrounds: an
external magnetic field and a CAB. Their effect consists in producing a
three-way mixing of the axion with the two polarizations of the photon. We
determine the proper frequencies and eigenvectors as well as the corresponding
photon ellipticity and induced rotation of the polarization plane that depend
both on the magnetic field and the local density of axions. We also comment on
the possibility that some of the predicted effects could be measured in optical
table-top experiments.
  Circularly polarized photons are energy eigenstates, with a modified
dispersion relation. This enables the emission of a photon by a charged
particle, which is forbidden in regular QED. We study the energy loss of a

Among the class of completely integrally closed Pr\""ufer domains, we focus on

latter being the one-dimensional Pr\""ufer domains whose maximal ideals are
finitely generated. However, numerous interesting examples show that the class

  Our method has several applications for improved bounds for efficient

used to improve upon the best known algorithms in the limited communication
setting: the algorithm can be implemented to obtain a randomized
expected-polynomial-time algorithm that uses poly-logarithmic communication and
finds a 0.6528-WSNE. The algorithm can also be carried out to beat the best
known bound in the query complexity setting, requiring $O(n \log n)$ payoff
queries to compute a 0.6528-WSNE. Finally, our approach can also be adapted to

observatories we can place upper bounds on the annihilation channels leading to
neutrinos. We find that, while endothermic scattering limits are weak in the

in particular in the spin-dependent case. Furthermore, we study the

disentangle the endothermic/exothermic nature of the scattering. Finally we

localize the prompt GRB emission and measure the evolution of the afterglow in
the visible band and in X-rays, a VHF communication system enabling the fast
transmission of SVOM alerts to the ground, and a ground segment including a

spectroscopy of the optical afterglow with large telescopes to measure the
redshifts. The study of GRBs in the next decade will benefit from a number of
large facilities in all wavelengths that will contribute to increase the

consider two dark matter models---Late Forming Dark Matter (LFDM) and
Ultra-Light Axion (ULA) models---where the matter power spectra show novel
effects on small scales. The high redshift universe offers a powerful probe of
their parameters. In particular, we study two cosmological observables: the
neutral hydrogen (HI) redshifted 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization,
and the evolution of the collapsed fraction of HI in the redshift range $2 < z
< 5$. We model the theoretical predictions of the models using CDM-like N-body
simulations with modified initial conditions, and generate reionization fields
using an excursion-set model. The N-body approximation is valid on the length
and halo mass scales studied.
  We show that LFDM and ULA models predict an increase in the HI power spectrum
from the epoch of reionization by a factor between 2--10 for a range of scales
$0.1<k<4 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. Assuming a fiducial model where a neutral hydrogen
fraction $\bar{x}_{HI}=0.5$ must be achieved by $z=8$, the reionization process
allows us to put approximate bounds on the redshift of dark matter formation
$z_f > 4 \times 10^5$ (for LFDM) and the axion mass $m_a > 2.6 \times 10^{-23}
\, \rm eV$ (for ULA). The comparison of the collapsed mass fraction inferred
from damped Lyman-$\alpha$ observations to the theoretical predictions of our
models lead to the weaker bounds: $z_f > 2 \times 10^5$ and $m_a > 10^{-23} \,
\rm eV$. These bounds are consistent with other constraints in the literature
using different observables; we briefly discuss how these bounds compare with
possible constraints from the observation of luminosity function of galaxies at
high redshifts. In the case of ULAs, these constraints are also consistent with
a solution to the cusp-core problem of CDM.

shown that this new relaxed requirement on the gauge group is nothing but the
minimal condition for energy positivity. The mechanism is demonstrated to be
mathematically possible and physically plausible on a U(1) based gauge theory
setting. The unified group, being an extension of the group of spacetime

propagating in a higher-dimensional bulk populated by collections of D-particle
stringy defects, provides a model for the growth of large-scale structure in
the universe via the vector field in its spectrum. The latter corresponds to
D-particle recoil velocity excitations as a result of the interactions of the
defects with stringy matter and radiation on the brane world. In this article,
we first elaborate further on the results of the previous study on the galactic
growth era and analyse the circumstances under which the D-particle recoil
velocity fluid may ""mimic"" dark matter in galaxies. A lensing phenomenology is
also presented for some samples of galaxies, which previously were known to
provide tension for modified gravity (TeVeS) models. The current model is found
in agreement with these lensing data. Then we discuss a cosmic evolution for
the D-material universe by analysing the conditions under which the late eras
of this universe associated with large-scale structure are connected to early
epochs, where inflation takes place. It is shown that inflation is induced by
dense populations of D-particles in the early universe, with the role of the
inflaton field played by the condensate of the D-particle recoil-velocity
fields under their interaction with relativistic stringy matter, only for
sufficiently large brane tensions and low string mass scales compared to the
Hubble scale. On the other hand, for large string scales, where the
recoil-velocity condensate fields are weak, inflation cannot be driven by the
D-particle defects alone. In such cases inflation may be driven by dilaton (or
other moduli) fields in the underlying string theory.

left-right symmetric models. Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is
ensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these
particles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates
with masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus
modified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also
today, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -
triplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter
to the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and
through astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the
latter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional
scalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology. The particles
under discussion share many features with the well-known candidates wino,
Higgsino, inert doublet scalar, sneutrino, and Minimal Dark Matter. In
particular, they all predict a large gamma-ray flux from dark matter
annihilations, which can be searched for with Cherenkov telescopes. We
furthermore discuss models with unequal left-right gauge couplings, $g_R \neq
g_L$, taking the recent experimental hints for a charged gauge boson with 2 TeV
mass as a benchmark point. In this case, the dark matter mass is determined by
the observed relic density.

dependence upon previously made measurements, can be shown by the violation of
inequalities based on measurements of well chosen observables. An important
property of such observables is that their expectation value can be expressed
in terms of probabilities of obtaining two exclusive outcomes. In order to
satisfy this, inequalities have been constructed using either observables with
a dichotomic spectrum or using periodic functions obtained from displacement
operators in phase space. Here we identify the general conditions on the
spectral decomposition of observables demonstrating state independent
contextuality of quantum mechanics. As a consequence, our results not only
unify existing strategies for maximal violation of state independent
non-contextual inequalities but also lead to new scenarii enabling such
violation. Among the consequences of our results is the impossibility of having
a state independent maximal violation of non-contextuality in the Peres-Mermin
scenario with discrete observables of odd dimensions.

range of molecular simulations. Given a simulation problem and a step size, the
method automatically chooses the optimal scheme out of an available family of
numerical integrators. Although we focus on two-stage splitting integrators,
the idea may be used with more general families. In each instance, the
system-specific integrating scheme identified by our approach is optimal in the
sense that it provides the best conservation of energy for harmonic forces. The
AIA method has been implemented in the BCAM-modified GROMACS software package.
Numerical tests in molecular dynamics and hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of
constrained and unconstrained physical systems show that the method
successfully realises the fail-safe strategy. In all experiments, and for each
of the criteria employed, the AIA is at least as good as, and often
significantly outperforms the standard Verlet scheme, as well as fixed
parameter, optimized two-stage integrators. In particular, the sampling
efficiency found in simulations using the AIA is up to 5 times better than the
one achieved with other tested schemes.

this question by obtaining an accurate approximation for the achievable

accuracy of our analysis. For practical values of signal transmit powers and AP
densities, the analytic expressions capture the behavior of the system well. As
an added benefit, the formulations developed here can be used in parametric

for viscoelastic creeping flow, modeled by the Oldroyd-B equations with polymer
stress diffusion, is derived. Near the extensional stagnation point the flow
stretches and aligns polymers along the outgoing streamlines of the stagnation
point resulting in a stress-island, or birefringent strand. The polymer stress
diffusion coefficient is used, both, as an asymptotic parameter and a
regularization parameter. The structure of the singular part of polymer stress
tensor is a Gaussian aligned with the incoming streamline of the stagnation
point; a smoothed $\delta$-distribution whose width is proportional to the
square-root of the diffusion coefficient. The amplitude of the stress island
scales with the Wiessenberg number and, although singular in the limit of
vanishing diffusion, it is integrable in the cross stream direction due to its
vanishing width; this yields a convergent secondary flow. The leading order
velocity response to this stress island is constructed and shown to be {\em
independent} of the diffusion coefficient in the limit. The secondary
circulation counteracts the forced flow and has a vorticity jump at the
location of the stress islands, essentially expelling the background vorticity
from the location of the birefringent strands. The analytic solutions are shown
to be in excellent quantitative agreement with full numerical simulations and,
therefore, the analytic solutions elucidate the salient mechanisms of the flow
response to viscoelasticity and the mechanism for instability.

rather than the tetragonal symmetry is the most common motif. Here, based on

composition MX2 (M=Mo, W, X=S, Se, Te) with a hexagonal lattice. They are all
in the same stability range as other 2D TMDC allotropes that have been
demonstrated experimentally, and they are identified to be practical 2D TIs
with large band gaps ranging from 41 to 198 meV, making them suitable for
applications at room-temperature. Besides, in contrast to tetragonal 2D TMDs,
their hexagonal lattice will greatly facilitate the integration of theses novel
TI states van-der-Waals crystals with other hexagonal or honeycomb materials,
and thus provide a route for 2D-material-based devices for wider nanoelectronic
and spintronic applications. The nontrivial band gaps of both WSe2 and WTe2 2D
crystals are 198 meV, which are larger than that in any previously reported
TMDC-based TIs. These large band gaps entirely stem from the strong spin-orbit
coupling strength within the d orbitals of Mo/W atoms near the Fermi level. Our
findings will significantly broaden the scientific and technological impact of
both 2D TIs and TMDCs.

remains unclear whether this reflects observational uncertainties or intrinsic
astrophysical scatter arising from physical conditions in the ISM at early
times. Aims: Measure differential chemical abundance ratios in extremely
metal-poor stars to investigate the limits of precision and to understand
whether cosmic scatter or observational errors are dominant. Methods: We used
high resolution (R $\sim 95,000$) and high S/N (S/N $= 700$ at 5000$\AA$)
HIRES/Keck spectra, to determine high precision differential abundances between
two extremely metal-poor stars through a line-by-line differential approach. We
determined stellar parameters for the star G64-37 with respect to the standard
star G64-12. We performed EW measurements for the two stars for the lines
recognized in both stars and performed spectral synthesis to study the carbon
abundances. Results: The differential approach allowed us to obtain errors of
$\sigma$(T$_{eff}$ ) $=$ 27 K, $\sigma$(log $g$) $=$ 0.06 dex, $\sigma$([Fe/H])
$=$ 0.02 dex and $\sigma$(v$_{t}$ ) $=$ 0.06 kms$^{-1}$. We estimated relative
chemical abundances with a precision as low as $\sigma$([X/Fe]) $\approx$ 0.01
dex. The small uncertainties demonstrate that there are genuine abundance
differences larger than the measurement errors. The observed Li difference can
not be explained by the difference in mass, because the less massive star has
more Li. Conclusions: It is possible to achieve an abundance precision around
$\approx$ 0.01-0.05 dex for extremely metal-poor stars, opening new windows on
the study of the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

extend our investigations to supergravity and to a class of gauge theories

facets or just one point. We study two sources of disorder: variations of NC

well on a statistical basis but suffers from ambiguities when applied on an

pickup loop due to DC magnetic fields ($\Phi$). Scanning SQUID can also measure
a sample's magnetic response to an applied current ($d\Phi/dI$) or voltage
($d\Phi/dV$) using standard lock-in techniques. In this manuscript, we
demonstrate that electric coupling between the scanning SQUID and a back
gate-tuned, magnetic sample can lead to a gate-voltage dependent artifact when
imaging $d\Phi/dI$ or $d\Phi/dV$. The electric coupling artifact results in
$d\Phi/dV$ and $d\Phi/dI$ images which mimic the spatial variation of the
static magnetic fields from the sample (e.g. ferromagnetic domains). In
back-gated $EuS/Bi_2Se_3$ bilayers, we show that the electric coupling effect
is important, and is responsible for the reported signal from chiral currents
in Y.H. Wang, et al. (DOI: 10.1126/science.aaa0508). Previous scanning SQUID
current imaging experiments are unaffected by this artifact, as they are either
on non-magnetic samples or the spatial distribution of magnetism does not match
the features observed in $d\Phi/dI$. In conclusion, $d\Phi/dI$ or $d\Phi/dV$
imaging of magnetic, back-gated samples should only be applied and interpreted
with great caution.

theories with a U(1) R-symmetry on Euclidean $S^3\times S_\beta^1$, with $S^3$
the unit-radius squashed three-sphere, and $\beta$ the circumference of the
circle. For superconformal theories, this partition function coincides (up to a
Casimir energy factor) with the 4d superconformal index.
  The partition function can be computed exactly using supersymmetric
localization of the gauge theory path-integral. It takes the form of an
elliptic hypergeometric integral, which may be viewed as a matrix-integral over
the moduli space of the holonomies of the gauge fields around $S_\beta^1$. At
high temperatures ($\beta\to 0$, corresponding to the hyperbolic limit of the
elliptic hypergeometric integral) we obtain from the matrix-integral a quantum
effective potential for the holonomies. The effective potential is proportional
to the temperature. Therefore the high-temperature limit further localizes the
matrix-integral to the locus of the minima of the potential. If the effective
potential is positive semi-definite, the leading high-temperature asymptotics
of the partition function is given by the formula of Di Pietro and Komargodski,
and the subleading asymptotics is connected to the Coulomb branch dynamics on
$R^3\times S^1$. In theories where the effective potential is not positive
semi-definite, the Di Pietro-Komargodski formula needs to be modified. In
particular, this modification occurs in the SU(2) theory of
Intriligator-Seiberg-Shenker, and the SO(N) theory of Brodie-Cho-Intriligator,
both believed to exhibit ""misleading"" anomaly matchings, and both believed to
yield interacting superconformal field theories with $c<a$.
  Two new simple tests for dualities between 4d supersymmetric gauge theories
emerge as byproducts of our analysis.

matter physics systems with strong correlations, a domain which has rapidly
grown over the last decade. By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of
correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial informations can be obtained
through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the
entanglement spectrum) and the associated R\'enyi entropies are now well
recognized to contains key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for
the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the
perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of
various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological
order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the
entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a
direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise
significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these
powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum
systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to
induce non-trivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect,
or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully
(re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in
details. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement
will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.

singularites which arise as exceptional orbit varieties of a special class of
prehomogeneous vector spaces, which are representations of linear algebraic
groups with open orbits. These hypersurface singularities include both
determinantal hypersurfaces and linear free (and free*) divisors. Although
these hypersurfaces have highly nonisolated singularities, we determine the
topology of their Milnor fibers, complements and links. We do so by using the
action of linear algebraic groups beginning with the complement, instead of
using Morse type arguments on the Milnor fibers. This includes replacing the
local Milnor fiber by a global Milnor fiber which has a complex geometry
resulting from a transitive action of an appropriate algebraic group, yielding
a compact model submanifold for the homotopy type of the Milnor fiber. The
topology includes the (co)homology (in characteristic 0, and 2 torsion in one
family) and homotopy groups, and we deduce the triviality of the monodromy
transformations on rational (or complex) cohomology. The cohomology of the
Milnor fibers and complements are isomorphic as algebras to exterior algebras
or for one family, modules over exterior algebras; and cohomology of the link
is, as a vector space, a truncated and shifted exterior algebra, for which the
cohomology product structure is essentially trivial. We also deduce from Bott's
periodicity theorem, the homotopy groups of the Milnor fibers for determinantal
hypersurfaces in the stable range as the stable homotopy groups of the
associated infinite dimensional symmetric spaces. Applying a Theorem of Oka we
obtain a class of formal linear combinations of exceptional orbit hypersurfaces

paramagnetic state described by DMFT we derive inter-site interactions by
considering the response of the DMFT grand potential to small fluctuations of

in the parent cubic structure of ternary chromium fluoride KCrF$_3$. We obtain
the onset of a G-type antiferro-orbital order at a significantly lower

layered A-type antiferromagnetic order and N\'eel temperature are rather well
reproduced. The calculated full Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian contains
spin-orbital coupling terms inducing a misalignment in the antiferro-orbital

problems for high-dimensional data. Distance measures have been used as natural
measures of (dis)similarity and served as the foundation of various learning
methods. The efficiency of distance-based learning methods heavily depends on
the chosen distance metric. With increasing dimensionality and complexity of
data, however, traditional metric learning methods suffer from poor scalability
and the limitation due to linearity as the true signals are usually embedded
within a low-dimensional nonlinear subspace. In this paper, we propose a
nonlinear sparse metric learning algorithm via boosting. We restructure a
global optimization problem into a forward stage-wise learning of weak learners
based on a rank-one decomposition of the weight matrix in the Mahalanobis
distance metric. A gradient boosting algorithm is devised to obtain a sparse
rank-one update of the weight matrix at each step. Nonlinear features are
learned by a hierarchical expansion of interactions incorporated within the
boosting algorithm. Meanwhile, an early stopping rule is imposed to control the
overall complexity of the learned metric. As a result, our approach guarantees
three desirable properties of the final metric: positive semi-definiteness, low
rank and element-wise sparsity. Numerical experiments show that our learning
model compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods in the current
literature of metric learning.

Discovery Rate (FDR), the given hypotheses can be naturally partitioned into
groups, and one may not only want to control the number of false discoveries
(wrongly rejected null hypotheses), but also the number of falsely discovered
groups of hypotheses (we say a group is falsely discovered if at least one
hypothesis within that group is rejected, when in reality the group contains
only nulls). In this paper, we introduce the p-filter, a procedure which
unifies and generalizes the standard FDR procedure by Benjamini and Hochberg
and global null testing procedure by Simes. We first prove that our proposed
method can simultaneously control the overall FDR at the finest level
(individual hypotheses treated separately) and the group FDR at coarser levels
(when such groups are user-specified). We then generalize the p-filter
procedure even further to handle multiple partitions of hypotheses, since that
might be natural in many applications. For example, in neuroscience
experiments, we may have a hypothesis for every (discretized) location in the
brain, and at every (discretized) timepoint: does the stimulus correlate with
activity in location x at time t after the stimulus was presented? In this
setting, one might want to group hypotheses by location and by time.
Importantly, our procedure can handle multiple partitions which are
nonhierarchical (i.e. one partition may arrange p-values by voxel, and another
partition arranges them by time point; neither one is nested inside the other).
We prove that our procedure controls FDR simultaneously across these multiple
lay- ers, under assumptions that are standard in the literature: we do not need
the hypotheses to be independent, but require a nonnegative dependence
condition known as PRDS.

prototypical potentials. We find that single-field models are remarkably robust
under the introduction of light scalar degrees of freedom. Models that are
ruled out at the single-field level are not improved in general, because good
values of the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can only be
obtained for very fine-tuned values of the extra field parameters and/or when
large non-Gaussianities are produced. The only exception is quartic large-field
inflation, so that the best models after Planck are of two kinds: plateau
potentials, regardless of whether an extra field is added or not, and quartic
large-field inflation with an extra light scalar field, in some specific
reheating scenarios. Using Bayesian complexity, we also find that more
parameters are constrained for the models we study than for their single-field
versions. This is because the added parameters not only contribute to the
reheating kinematics but also to the cosmological perturbations themselves, to
which the added field contributes. The interplay between these two effects lead
to a suppression of degeneracies that is responsible for having more
constrained parameters.

that the present force is, most likely, attributed to considerable enhancement

for years as ostensibly the most massive stellar-mass black hole, with a mass
estimated to be about twice that of its closest rival. However, striking
results presented recently by Laycock et al. reveal that the mass estimate,
based on emission-line velocities, is unreliable and that the mass of the X-ray
source is essentially unconstrained. Using Chandra and NuSTAR data, we rule
against a neutron-star model and conclude that IC 10 X-1 contains a black hole.
The eclipse duration of IC 10 X-1 is shorter and its depth shallower at higher
energies, an effect consistent with the X-ray emission being obscured during
eclipse by a Compton-thick core of a dense wind. The spectrum is strongly
disk-dominated, which allows us to constrain the spin of the black hole via
X-ray continuum fitting. Three other wind-fed black-hole systems are known; the
masses and spins of their black holes are high: M ~ 10-15 Msun and a*>0.8. If
the mass of IC 10 X-1's black hole is comparable, then its spin is likewise
high.

qubits that do not interact and that are separated by a long and lossy
transmission channel, using Markovian reservoir engineering. The proposal uses
only the correlated decay into the common channel of remotely separated, driven
single-photon qubit transitions. This simple scheme is generic and applicable
to various experimental implementations, including circuit and cavity QED, with
little experimental overhead compared with methods requiring dynamic control,
initialization, measurement, or feedback. In addition to avoiding these
inefficiencies, the simple protocol is highly robust against noise,
miscalibration, and loss in the channel. We find high quality solutions over a
wide range of parameters and show that the optimal strategy reflects a
transition from ballistic to diffusive photon transmission, going from
symmetrically and coherently driving a common steady state to asymmetrically
absorbing photons that are emitted from one qubit by the second. Detailed
analysis of the role of the transmission channel shows that allowing
bi-directional decay drastically increases indistinguishability and thereby
quadratically suppresses infidelity.

Higgs models: flavor bounds imply a tuning of a few per-mille (at best) in the

tension by opening up a new region of parameter space, obtained by raising the
coupling among the composites close to the strong coupling limit $g_* \sim
4\pi$, thereby raising the scale of composites to around 10 TeV. This does not
lead to large tuning in the Higgs potential since the leading quantum
corrections are canceled by the twin partners (rather than the composites). We
survey the leading flavor bounds on the CTH, which correspond to tree-level
$\Delta F=2$ four-Fermi operators from Kaluza-Klein (KK) Z exchange in the kaon
system and 1-loop corrections from KK fermions to the electric dipole moment of
the neutron. We provide a parametric estimate for these bounds and also perform
a numeric scan of the parameter space using the complete calculation for both

metal-poor triple star system that hosts five sub-Earth-sized planets orbiting
the primary star (Kepler-444A), as well as a spatially unresolved pair of M
dwarfs (Kepler-444BC) at a projected distance of 1.8"" (66 AU). We combine our
Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics astrometry with multi-epoch Keck/HIRES RVs of all
three stars to determine a precise orbit for the BC pair around A, given their
empirically constrained masses. We measure minimal astrometric motion
($1.0\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, or $0.17\pm0.10$ km s$^{-1}$), but our RVs reveal
significant orbital velocity ($1.7\pm0.2$ km s$^{-1}$) and acceleration
($7.8\pm0.5$ m s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$). We determine a highly eccentric stellar
orbit ($e=0.864\pm0.023$) that brings the tight M dwarf pair within
$5.0^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ AU of the planetary system. We validate that the system is
dynamically stable in its present configuration via n-body simulations. We find
that the A$-$BC orbit and planetary orbits are likely aligned (98%) given that
they both have edge-on orbits and misalignment induces precession of the
planets out of transit. We conclude that the stars were likely on their current
orbits during the epoch of planet formation, truncating the protoplanetary disk
at $\approx$2 AU. This truncated disk would have been severely depleted of
solid material from which to form the total $\approx$1.5 $M_{\rm Earth}$ of
planets. We thereby strongly constrain the efficiency of the conversion of dust
into planets and suggest that the Kepler-444 system is consistent with models
that explain the formation of more typical close-in Kepler planets in normal,
not truncated, disks.

disk and mimicking the observations from Genzel et al. (2011) at $z \sim 2$, we

their substructure in our simulation. No additional energy input, e.g. via

that the accretion rate of BHs embedded in bulges is proportional to
r_{B,eff}/r_B, where r_{B,eff} is the increased effective Bondi radius that
includes the gravitational potential of the bulge, and r_B is the Bondi radius
of the BH. The radiative feedback from the BH suppresses the cold accretion
rate to ~1 percent of the Bondi rate when a bulge is not considered. However,
we find that the BH fueling rate increases rapidly when the bulge mass M_bulge
is greater than the critical value of 10^6 M_sun and is proportional to
M_bulge. Since the critical bulge mass is independent of the central BH mass
M_{BH}, the growth rate of BHs with masses of 10^2, 10^4, and 10^6 M_sun
exhibits distinct dependencies on the bulge-to-BH mass ratio. Our results imply
that light seed BHs (<= 10^2 M_sun) which might be the remnants of the Pop III
stars, cannot grow through accretion coevally with the early assembly of the
bulge of the host galaxies until the bulge reaches the critical mass. However,
massive BH seeds (>= 10^5 M_sun) that may form via direct collapse, are more
likely to be embedded in a supercritical bulge and thus can grow efficiently
coupling to the host galaxies and driving the early evolution of the
M_{BH}-$\sigma$ relationship.

nuclear regions of galaxies. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelings of the above
molecular emission lines involving both collisional and radiative excitation,

galaxies' ISM velocity dispersions will be positively correlated with their
star formation rates, the forms of the correlation predicted by these two
models are subtly but measurably different. A feedback-driven origin for the
turbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star
formation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. $\dot{M}_*

standing staple of predictive modeling, in the last decade mostly as
``sub-learners'' within state of the art ensemble methods like Boosting and
Random Forest. However, a fundamental flaw in the partitioning (or splitting)
rule of commonly used tree building methods precludes them from treating
different types of variables equally. This most clearly manifests in these
methods' inability to properly utilize categorical variables with a large
number of categories, which are ubiquitous in the new age of big data. Such
variables can often be very informative, but current tree methods essentially
leave us a choice of either not using them, or exposing our models to severe
overfitting. We propose a conceptual framework to splitting using leave-one-out
(LOO) cross validation for selecting the splitting variable, then performing a
regular split (in our case, following CART's approach) for the selected
variable. The most important consequence of our approach is that categorical
variables with many categories can be safely used in tree building and are only
chosen if they contribute to predictive power. We demonstrate in extensive
simulation and real data analysis that our novel splitting approach
significantly improves the performance of both single tree models and ensemble
methods that utilize trees. Importantly, we design an algorithm for LOO
splitting variable selection which under reasonable assumptions does not
increase the overall computational complexity compared to CART for two-class

computational burden, replacing a O(log(n)) factor in CART splitting rule

simulation results with observable characteristics of the Kepler sample. We
identify mixture models with different primordial planetesimal disk properties

ratio distributions of the Kepler planets. We draw three main conclusions: (1)
We favor a ""frozen-in"" narrative for systems of short period planets, in which
they are stable over long timescales, as opposed to metastable. (2) The ""Kepler
dichotomy"", an observed phenomenon of the Kepler sample wherein the
architectures of planetary systems appear to either vary significantly or have
multiple modes, can naturally be explained by formation within planetesimal
disks with varying surface density profiles. Finally, (3) we quantify the
nature of the ""Kepler dichotomy"" for both GK stars and M dwarfs, and find that
it varies with stellar type. While the mode of planet formation that accounts

strength and acquire a finite spin-polarization. Moreover, the degenerate,
spin-polarized, zero energy bound states are unstable to applied Zeeman fields

emerge. Automated devices such as sensors, tracking devices, and meters - often
referred to as machine-to-machine (M2M) or machine-type communications (MTC) -
introduce an attractive revenue stream for mobile network operators, if a
massive number of them can be efficiently supported. The novel technical
challenges posed by MTC applications include increased overhead and control
signaling as well as diverse application-specific constraints such as ultra-low
complexity, extreme energy efficiency, critical timing, and continuous data
intensive uploading. This paper explains the new requirements and challenges
that large-scale MTC applications introduce, and provides a survey on key
techniques for overcoming them. We focus on the potential of 4.5G and 5G
networks to serve both the high data rate needs of conventional human-type
communications (HTC) subscribers and the forecasted billions of new MTC
devices. We also opine on attractive economic models that will enable this new
class of cellular subscribers to grow to its full potential.

consider chemical erosion of the forming grains. We find that carbonaceous dust
forms efficiently in the core of the ejecta, but takes several years to
condensate, longer than previously estimated. It forms unevenly and remains
concentrated in the inner part of the remnant. These results support the role
of core-collapse supernovae as dust factories and provide new insight on the

known prograde x1 orbit family originates from the same parent orbit as the box
orbits in stationary and rotating triaxial ellipsoids. However only a small
fraction of bar orbits ~4% have predominately prograde motion like their
periodic parent orbit. Most bar orbits arising from the x1 orbit have little
net angular momentum in the bar frame making them equivalent to box orbits in
rotating triaxial potentials. A small fraction of bar orbits (~7%) are long
axis tubes that behave exactly like those in triaxial ellipsoids:they are
tipped about the intermediate-axis due to the Coriolis force, with the sense of
tipping determined by the sign of their angular momentum about the long axis.
No orbits parented by prograde periodic x2 orbits are found in the pure bar
model, but a tiny population (~2%) of short axis tube orbits parented by
retrograde x4 orbits are found. When a central point mass representing a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) is grown adiabatically at the center of the bar,
those orbits that lie in the immediate vicinity of the SMBH are transformed
into precessing Keplerian orbits (PKOs) which belong the same major families
(short axis tubes, long axis tubes and boxes) occupying the bar at larger
radii. During the growth of a SMBH the inflow of mass and outward transport of
angular momentum transforms some x1 and long axis tube orbits into prograde
short axis tubes. This study has important implications for future attempts to
constrain the masses of SMBHs in barred galaxies using orbit based methods like
the Schwarzschild orbit superposition scheme and for understanding the observed

exhibiting minimal complexity is addressed. In this case, measurements are
exclusively available in hard-limited form. Assessing the achievable
sensitivity via the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound requires characterization of the
likelihood function, which is intractable for multivariate binary
distributions. In this context, the Fisher matrix of the exponential family and
a lower bound for arbitrary probabilistic models are discussed. The
conservative approximation for Fisher's information matrix rests on a surrogate
exponential family distribution connected to the actual data-generating system
by two compact equivalences. Without characterizing the likelihood and its
support, this probabilistic notion enables designing estimators that
consistently achieve the sensitivity as defined by the inverse of the
conservative information matrix. For parameter estimation with multivariate
binary samples, a quadratic exponential surrogate distribution tames
statistical complexity such that a quantitative assessment of an achievable
sensitivity level becomes tractable. This fact is exploited for the performance
analysis concerning parameter estimation with an array of low-complexity binary
sensors in comparison to an ideal system featuring infinite amplitude
resolution. Additionally, data-driven assessment by estimating a conservative
approximation for the Fisher matrix under recursive binary sampling as

there are no infrastructural impediments to the achievement of peak rail

holographic systems, and from above by the speed of light. The former is
realized for sufficiently broad quenches, while the latter pertains for well
localized quenches. The non-universal behavior in the intermediate regime

unit n-cube I^n. It is nonobtuse if none its dihedral angles is obtuse, and
acute if additionally none of them is right. Acute 0/1-simplices in I^n can be
represented by 0/1-matrices P of size n x n whose Gramians have an inverse that
is strictly diagonally dominant, with negative off-diagonal entries.
  In this paper, we will prove that the positive part D of the transposed
inverse of P is doubly stochastic and has the same support as P. The negated
negative part C of P^-T is strictly row-substochastic and its support is
complementary to that of D, showing that P^-T=D-C has no zero entries and has
positive row sums. As a consequence, for each facet F of an acute 0/1-facet S
there exists at most one other acute 0/1-simplex T in I^n having F as a facet.
We call T the acute neighbor of S at F.
  If P represents a 0/1-simplex that is merely nonobtuse, P^-T can have entries
equal to zero. Its positive part D is still doubly stochastic, but its support
may be strictly contained in the support of P. This allows P to be partly
decomposable. In theory, this might cause a nonobtuse 0/1-simplex S to have
several nonobtuse neighbors at each of its facets.
  Next, we study nonobtuse 0/1-simplices S having a partly decomposable matrix
representation P. We prove that such a simplex also has a block diagonal matrix
representation with at least two diagonal blocks, and show that a nonobtuse
simplex with partly decomposable matrix representation can be split in mutually
orthogonal fully indecomposable simplicial facets whose dimensions add up to n.
Using this insight, we are able to extend the one neighbor theorem for acute
simplices to a larger class of nonobtuse simplices.

usage behavior of energy users (EUs). However, most existing schemes use the
assumption that a buyer pays the same price per unit of energy to all suppliers
at any particular time when energy is bought. By contrast, here a discriminate
pricing technique using game theory is studied. A cake cutting game is
investigated, in which participating EUs in a smart community decide on the
price per unit of energy to charge a shared facility controller (SFC) in order
to sell surplus energy. The focus is to study fairness criteria to maximize sum
benefits to EUs and ensure an envy-free energy trading market. A benefit
function is designed that leverages generation of discriminate pricing by each
EU, according to the amount of surplus energy that an EU trades with the SFC
and the EU's sensitivity to price. It is shown that the game possesses a
socially optimal, and hence also Pareto optimal, solution. Further, an
algorithm that can be implemented by each EU in a distributed manner to reach
the optimal solution is proposed. Numerical case studies are given that
demonstrate beneficial properties of the scheme.

these classifiers, we fit logistic regressions between the queue imbalance and

assumes that the direction of mid-price changes is uncorrelated with the queue

\pm 0.041]$ with a standard deviation about this line of 0.109, SMC: $[0.472
\pm 0.265]$ with a standard deviation about this line of 0.091). The fact that
fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars obey a flat relation at minimum light and
overtone RR Lyrae stars do not is consistent with the interaction of the
stellar photosphere and hydrogen ionization front. We compare these results
with PC relations for fundamental and first overtone Cepheids. The fact that
the PC relations change significantly as a function of phase indicates strongly
that Cepheid and RR Lyrae relations can only be understood at mean light when
their properties as a function of phase are determined.

  Problems","32 pages",,,,"math.OC cs.LG math.NA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Error bounds, which refer to inequalities that bound the distance of vectors
in a test set to a given set by a residual function, have proven to be
extremely useful in analyzing the convergence rates of a host of iterative
methods for solving optimization problems. In this paper, we present a new
framework for establishing error bounds for a class of structured convex
optimization problems, in which the objective function is the sum of a smooth
convex function and a general closed proper convex function. Such a class
encapsulates not only fairly general constrained minimization problems but also
various regularized loss minimization formulations in machine learning, signal
processing, and statistics. Using our framework, we show that a number of
existing error bound results can be recovered in a unified and transparent
manner. To further demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to a
class of nuclear-norm regularized loss minimization problems and establish a
new error bound for this class under a strict complementarity-type regularity
condition. We then complement this result by constructing an example to show
that the said error bound could fail to hold without the regularity condition.
Consequently, we obtain a rather complete answer to a question raised by Tseng.
We believe that our approach will find further applications in the study of
error bounds for structured convex optimization problems.

achieving high drive current in atomic layer MoS2 channel based field-effect
transistors. Approaches such as choosing metals with appropriate work functions
and chemical doping are employed previously to improve the carrier injection
from the contact electrodes to the channel and to mitigates the SBH between the
MoS2 and metal. Recent experiments demonstrate significant SBH reduction when
graphene layer is inserted between metal slab (Ti and Ni) and MoS2. However,
the physical or chemical origin of this phenomenon is not yet clearly
understood. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) simulations are
performed, employing pseudopotentials with very high basis sets to get insights
of the charge transfer between metal and monolayer MoS2 through the inserted
graphene layer. Our atomistic simulations on 16 different interfaces involving
five different metals (Ti, Ag, Ru, Au and Pt) reveal that: (i) such a decrease
in SBH is not consistent among various metals, rather an increase in SBH is
observed in case of Au and Pt (ii) unlike MoS2-metal interface, the projected
dispersion of MoS2 remains preserved in any MoS2-graphene-metal system with
shift in the bands on the energy axis. (iii) a proper choice of metal (e.g.,
Ru) may exhibit ohmic nature in a graphene inserted MoS2-metal contact. These

bodies in other planetary systems. The proximity and luminosity of the star
make key features of its debris, like the water ice-line, accessible. Here we
present ALMA cycle 1, 870 \mu m (345 GHz) observations targeted at the inner
part of the Fomalhaut system with a synthesized beam of 0.45""x0.37"" (~3 AU
linear resolution at the distance of Fomalhaut) and a rms of 26 \mu Jy/beam.
The high angular resolution and sensitivity of the ALMA data enable us to place
strong constraints on the nature of the warm excess revealed by Spitzer and
Herschel observations. We detect a point source at the star position with a
total flux consistent with thermal emission from the stellar photosphere. No
structures that are brighter than 3\sigma\ are detected in the central 15 AU x
15 AU region. Modeling the spectral energy distribution using parameters
expected for a dust-producing planetesimal belt indicates a radial location in
the range ~8-15 AU. This is consistent with the location where ice sublimates
in Fomalhaut, i.e., an asteroid-belt analog. The 3\sigma\ upper limit for such
a belt is <1.3 mJy at 870 \mu m. We also interpret the 2 and 8-13 \mu m
interferometric measurements to reveal the structure in the inner 10 AU region
as dust naturally connected to this proposed asteroid belt by
Poynting-Robertson drag, dust sublimation, and magnetically trapped nano
grains.

CDM cosmology. The half-mode mass in the WDM power spectrum of our simulations
is Mf= 2x 10^10 Msun. In the dark matter only simulations halo density profiles
are well described by the NFW parametric fit in both cosmologies, though the
WDM halos have concentrations lower by factors 1.5--2.0 than their CDM
counterparts. In the hydrodynamic simulations, the effects of baryons
significantly flatten the inner density, velocity dispersion, and pseudo
phase-space density profiles of the WDM halos but not of the CDM ones. The
density slope measured at ~ 0.02xRv, alpha, becomes shallow in periods of 2 to
5 Gyr in the WDM runs. We explore whether this flattening process correlates
with the global SF, Ms/Mv ratio, gas outflow, and internal specific angular
momentum histories. We do not find any clear trends but when alpha is shallower
than -0.5, Ms/Mv is always between 0.25 and 1%. We conclude that the main
reason of the formation of the shallow core is the presence of strong gas mass
fluctuations inside the inner halo, which are a consequence of the feedback
driven by a very bursty and sustained SF history in shallow gravitational
potentials. Our WDM halos, which assemble late and are less concentrated than
the CDM ones, obey these conditions. There are also (rare) CDM systems with
extended mass assembly histories that obey these conditions and form indeed
shallow cores. The dynamical heating and expansion processes, behind the DM
core flattening, apply also to the stars in a such a way that the stellar age
and metallicity gradients of the dwarfs are softened, their stellar half-mass
radii strongly grow with time, and their central surface densities decrease.

  Games",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the optimization problem faced by a perfectly informed principal in
a Bayesian game, who reveals information to the players about the state of
nature to obtain a desirable equilibrium. This signaling problem is the natural
design question motivated by uncertainty in games and has attracted much recent
attention. We present new hardness results for signaling problems in (a)
Bayesian two-player zero-sum games, and (b) Bayesian network routing games.
  For Bayesian zero-sum games, when the principal seeks to maximize the
equilibrium utility of a player, we show that it is NP-hard to obtain an
additive FPTAS. Our hardness proof exploits duality and the equivalence of
separation and optimization in a novel way. Further, we rule out an additive
PTAS assuming planted clique hardness, which states that no polynomial time
algorithm can recover a planted clique from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph.
Complementing these, we obtain a PTAS for a structured class of zero-sum games
(where obtaining an FPTAS is still NP-hard) when the payoff matrices obey a
Lipschitz condition. Previous results ruled out an FPTAS assuming
planted-clique hardness, and a PTAS only for implicit games with
quasi-polynomial-size strategy sets.
  For Bayesian network routing games, wherein the principal seeks to minimize
the average latency of the Nash flow, we show that it is NP-hard to obtain a
(multiplicative) $(4/3 - \epsilon)$-approximation, even for linear latency
functions. This is the optimal inapproximability result for linear latencies,
since we show that full revelation achieves a $(4/3)$-approximation for linear
latencies.

implementation of the distributed consensus algorithm as a fundamental
algorithm for the purpose of in-network collaborative processing. This paper
focuses on optimizing the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm for both
classical and quantum networks. A novel model of the gossip algorithm with
non-uniform clock distribution is proposed which can reach the optimal
convergence rate of the continuous-time consensus algorithm. It is described
that how the non-uniform clock distribution is achievable by modifying the rate
of the Poisson process modeling the clock of the gossip algorithm. The
minimization problem for optimizing the asymptotic convergence rate of the
proposed gossip algorithm and its corresponding semidefinite programming
formulation is addressed analytically. It is shown that the optimal results
obtained for uniform clock distribution are suboptimal compared to those of the
non-uniform one and for non-uniform distribution the optimal answer is not
unique i.e. there is more than one set of probabilities that can achieve the
optimal convergence rate. Based on the optimal continuous-time consensus
algorithm and the detailed balance property, an effective method of obtaining
one of these optimal answers is proposed. Regarding quantum gossip algorithm,
by expanding the density matrix in terms of the generalized Gell-Mann matrices,
the evolution equation of the quantum gossip algorithm is transformed to the
state update equation of the classical gossip algorithm. By defining the
quantum gossip operator, the original optimization problem is formulated as a
convex optimization problem, which can be addressed by semidefinite
programming.

incompressible rotation the equilibrium is governed by a generalized
Grad-Shafranov (GGS) equation and a decoupled Bernoulli-type equation for the
pressure. For parallel flow the GGS equation can be transformed to one
identical in form with the usual GS equation. In the present study on the basis

impact on the current density being stronger in the parallel direction than in
the toroidal one. Also, the linear stability of the equilibria constructed is

scales of one~thousand to one million years. We focus specifically on the
phenomenon of ice ages that has characterised the slow evolution of climate
over the Quaternary. Ice ages are a form of variability featuring interactions
between different large-scale components and processes in the climate system,
including ice sheet, deep-ocean and carbon cycle dynamics. This variability is
also at least partly controlled by changes in the seasonal and latitudinal
incoming solar radiation associated with the combined effects of changes in
Earth's orbit shape, precession of equinoxes, and changes in obliquity. A
number of possible mechanisms are reviewed in this chapter. We stress that the
nature of the interactions between these slow dynamics and faster modes of
variability, such as millennium and centennial modes of variability, are still
poorly understood. For example, whether the time sequence of ice ages is
robustly determined or not by the astronomical forcing is a matter of debate.
These questions need to be addressed with a range of models. We propose to use
stochastic parameterisations in the lower resolution models (focusing on
climate time scales) to account for weather and macro-weather dynamics
simulated with higher resolution models. We discuss challenges---including
statistical challenges---and possible methods associated with this programme.

that each tuple in the result must satisfy. This model is computationally
efficient, as the database system can evaluate the query conditions on each
tuple individually. However, many practical, real-world problems require a
collection of result tuples to satisfy constraints collectively, rather than
individually. In this paper, we present package queries, a new query model that
extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints and
preferences over answer sets. We develop a full-fledged package query system,
implemented on top of a traditional database engine. Our work makes several
contributions. First, we design PaQL, a SQL-based query language that supports
the declarative specification of package queries. We prove that PaQL is as
least as expressive as integer linear programming, and therefore, evaluation of
package queries is in general NP-hard. Second, we present a fundamental
evaluation strategy that combines the capabilities of databases and constraint
optimization solvers to derive solutions to package queries. The core of our
approach is a set of translation rules that transform a package query to an
integer linear program. Third, we introduce an offline data partitioning
strategy allowing query evaluation to scale to large data sizes. Fourth, we
introduce SketchRefine, a scalable algorithm for package evaluation, with
strong approximation guarantees ($(1 \pm\epsilon)^6$-factor approximation).
Finally, we present extensive experiments over real-world and benchmark data.
The results demonstrate that SketchRefine is effective at deriving high-quality
package results, and achieves runtime performance that is an order of magnitude
faster than directly using ILP solvers over large datasets.

modulation in the two-point correlation function of galaxies. To measure this

construct an optimal estimator to measure the dipole with multiple populations.
We show that this estimator increases the signal-to-noise of the dipole by up
to 35 percent. Using 6 populations of galaxies, in a survey with halos and
number densities similar to those of the millennium simulation, we forecast a
cumulative signal-to-noise of 4.4. For the main galaxy sample of SDSS at low
redshift z<0.2 our optimal estimator predicts a cumulative signal-to-noise of
2.4. Finally we forecast a cumulative signal-to-noise of 7.4 in the upcoming

neuronal. In this article we study one of the simplest possible systems with
pulse interaction: a phase oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback. When the
oscillator reaches a specific state, it emits a pulse, which returns after
propagating through a delay line. The impact of an incoming pulse is described
by the oscillator's phase reset curve (PRC). In such a system we discover an
unexpected phenomenon: for a sufficiently steep slope of the PRC, a periodic
regular spiking solution bifurcates with several multipliers crossing the unit
circle at the same parameter value. The number of such critical multipliers
increases linearly with the delay and thus may be arbitrary large. This
bifurcation is accompanied by the emergence of numerous ""jittering"" regimes
with non-equal interspike intervals (ISIs). Each of these regimes corresponds
to a periodic solution of the system with a period roughly proportional to the
delay. The number of different ""jittering"" solutions emerging at the
bifurcation point increases exponentially with the delay. We describe the
combinatorial mechanism that underlies the emergence of such a variety of
solutions. In particular, we show how a periodic solution exhibiting several
distinct ISIs can imply the existence of multiple other solutions obtained by
rearranging of these ISIs. We show that the theoretical results for phase
oscillators accurately predict the behavior of an experimentally implemented

emerging due to wave-current interactions. With this purpose, we use a simple
governing equation which is a nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) extended by
R. Smith (1976). This extended NLSE accounts for the effects of current
gradient on the nonlinear dynamics of the ocean surface near blocking point.
Using a split-step scheme we show that the extended NLSE of Smith is unstable
against random chaotic perturbation in the current profile. Therefore the
monochromatic wave field with unit amplitude turns into a chaotic sea state
with many peaks. By comparing the numerical and analytical results, we show
that rogue waves due to perturbations in the current profile are in the form of
rational rogue wave solutions of the NLSE. We also discuss the effects of
magnitude of the chaotic current profile perturbations on the statistics of the
rogue wave generation at the ocean surface. The extension term in Smith's
extended NLSE causes phase shifts and it does not change the total energy level
of the wave field. Using the methodology adopted in this work, the dynamics of
rogue wave occurrence on the ocean surface due to blocking effect of currents
can be studied. This enhances the safety of the offshore operations and ocean
travel.

  We show that each model has both advantages and limitations. While the
first-order analytical model is algebraically simple and easy to implement, it
is only applicable in regions of the parameter space where the perturbations
are sufficiently small. The second-order model, although more complex, has a
larger range of validity and must be taken into account for dynamical studies
of some real exoplanetary systems such as $\gamma$-Cephei and HD 41004A.

  This code is based on universal Keplerian variables and Stumpff functions
formalism. We present two versions of this code, the second one using a
different set of angular variables designed to avoid degeneracies arising when
the projected orbital motion is quasi-radial, as it is the case for PZ Tel B.
We also present additional observations of PZ Tel B.
  The code is applied to Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B. Concerning Fomalhaut b, we
confirm previous results, but we show that open orbital solutions are also
possible. The eccentricity distribution nevertheless peaks around ~0.9 in the
bound regime. We present a first successful orbital fit of PZ Tel B, showing in
particular that the eccentricity distribution presents a sharp peak very close
to e=1, meaning a quasi-parabolic orbit.
  It was recently suggested that unseen inner companions may lead orbital
fitting algorithms to artificially give high eccentricities. We show that this
caveat is unlikely to apply to Fomalhaut b. Concerning PZ Tel B, an inner ~12
MJup companion would mimic a e=1 orbit despite a real eccentricity around 0.7,
but a dynamical analysis reveals that such a system would not be stable. We
conclude that our orbital fit is robust.

where scale-dependent behaviour is important. Its functional formulation can be
cast into the form of an exact flow equation for the scale-dependent effective
action in the presence of an infrared regularisation. The functional RG flow
for the scale-dependent effective action depends explicitly on the choice of
regulator, while the physics does not. In this work, we systematically
investigate three key aspects of how the regulator choice affects RG flows: (i)
We study flow trajectories along closed loops in the space of action
functionals varying both, the regulator scale and shape function. Such a flow
does not vanish in the presence of truncations. Based on a definition of the
length of an RG trajectory, we suggest a practical procedure for devising
optimised regularisation schemes within a truncation. (ii) In systems with
various field variables, a choice of relative cutoff scales is required. At the
example of relativistic bosonic two-field models, we study the impact of this
choice as well as its truncation dependence. We show that a crossover between
different universality classes can be induced and conclude that the relative
cutoff scale has to be chosen carefully for a reliable description of a
physical system. (iii) Non-relativistic continuum models of coupled fermionic
and bosonic fields exhibit also dependencies on relative cutoff scales and
regulator shapes. At the example of the Fermi polaron problem in three spatial
dimensions, we illustrate such dependencies and show how they can be
interpreted in physical terms.

initially prepared in a Gaussian state, e.g. a squeezed thermal state, and
compare the dynamics resulting from local noise, i.e. oscillators coupled to
two independent external fields, to that originating from common noise, i.e.
oscillators interacting with a single common field. We prove non-Markovianity
(non-divisibility) of the dynamics in both regimes and analyze the connections
between non-divisibility, backflow of information and revivals of quantum
correlations. Our main results may be summarized as follows: (i) revivals of
quantumness are present in both scenarios, however, the interaction with a
common environment better preserves the quantum features of the system; (ii)
the dynamics is always non-divisible but revivals of quantum correlations are
present only when backflow of information is present as well. We conclude that
non-divisibility in its own is not a resource to preserve quantum correlations
in our system, i.e. it is not sufficient to observe recoherence phenomena.
Rather, it represents a necessary prerequisite to obtain backflow of
information, which is the true ingredient to obtain revivals of quantumness.

energy electron distributions. The largest SZ distortion in the CMB is caused
by the hot electrons present in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). However,
several other small scale astrophysical processes can also contribute to the SZ
distortion in the CMB.
  Analytic studies have shown that the interstellar (ISM) electron gas of the
host galaxy heated by quasar feedback can also cause substantial SZ effect. For
successful detection of the quasar feedback signal, the SZ signal from the
virialized gas in the host halos of quasars needs to be properly quantified. In
this dissertation work, I have estimated the SZ signal from quasar hosts using
analytic models of the virialized gas in the ICM/ISM. As a new extension to
existing work I have used the measured Halo Occupation Distribution properties
of quasar hosts. The results show that the average SZ signal from quasar hosts
decreases with redshift. This result is consist what what has been observed by
the Planck team.
  I have compared by calculations with the experimental results of Ruan et al.
(2015). While Ruan et al. (2015) claim their detection to be from quasar
feedback, I find that within the errors of my model, their detection can be
explained with halo signal alone, without introducing feedback.

However, theory has struggled to quantitatively predict the damping, even in
common ferromagnetic materials. This presents a challenge for a broad range of
applications in spintronics and spin-orbitronics that depend on materials and
structures with ultra-low damping. Such systems enable many experimental
investigations that further our theoretical understanding of numerous magnetic
phenomena such as damping and spin-transport mediated by chirality and the
Rashba effect. Despite this requirement, it is believed that achieving
ultra-low damping in metallic ferromagnets is limited due to the scattering of
magnons by the conduction electrons. However, we report on a binary alloy of Co
and Fe that overcomes this obstacle and exhibits a damping parameter
approaching 0.0001, which is comparable to values reported only for
ferrimagnetic insulators. We explain this phenomenon by a unique feature of the
bandstructure in this system: The density of states exhibits a sharp minimum at
the Fermi level at the same alloy concentration at which the minimum in the
magnetic damping is found. This discovery provides both a significant
fundamental understanding of damping mechanisms as well as a test of

solar activity period 2008-2009 are investigated. The present paper reports the
existence of frequency-peaks < 20 mHz in the compressional component of the
magnetic field in almost all CHAMP passes. The magnetic field variations
associated with these frequencies have amplitude of a few tens of nT during
daytime. The geomagnetic activity and interplanetary magnetic field parameters
were observed to be low during the period of study. The spectral powers of the
observed frequencies show no dependence on solar wind velocity and cone angle;
hence the reported frequencies are not related to the geomagnetic pulsations.
For frequency-peaks <15 mHz, strong local-time dependence is observed with
maximum power near noon and minimum at night. The longitudinal and seasonal
variations of the powers of these frequency-peaks match well with those of the
equator-to-middle latitude ionospheric currents derived by the earlier studies.
As a polar Low-Earth-Orbiting (LEO) satellite spans the entire range of
latitudes within few minutes, it monitors the geomagnetic field variations
caused by the quiet-time ionospheric currents flowing at different latitudes.
This can result in certain frequencies in the magnetic field recorded by LEO
satellites. We demonstrate that the frequencies <10mHz are mainly due to the
latitudinal structure of the equatorial electrojet. The observed frequencies in
CHAMP data are therefore attributed to the latitudinal structures of the
ionospheric currents that are monitored only by the polar LEO satellites and

leverage (defined as debt over asset) and (iii) trust (defined as the maximum
sustainable leverage) is proposed to investigate the role of credit in the
dynamics of economic growth, and how credit may be associated with both
economic performance and confidence. Our first notable finding is the mechanism
of reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return on
assets. In regular economies where the EBITA/Assets ratio is larger than the
cost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest
long-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth).
Our second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central
bank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth. We find
that late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highest
long-term return on assets and largest asset value. But this comes at the cost
of suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs. The
phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows
trust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust is
high. These results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying our
model: (a) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage; (b) economic
agents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of
assets. Using a Markov Switching Model for the EBITA/Assets ratio, we have
successfully calibrated our model to the empirical data of the return on equity
of the EURO STOXX 50 for the time period 2000-2013. We find that dynamics of
leverage and trust can be highly non-monotonous with curved trajectories, as a
result of the nonlinear coupling between the variables.

quantitative description of the high-energy part is not satisfactory. The
low-energy ISM and ISD strengths of the cluster modes are enhanced by the
radial motion of $\alpha$ clusters, and they split into a couple of states
because of the angular motion of $\alpha$ clusters. The low-energy ISM

greatly simplifies the expressions for the linear variation of the bimetric
interaction terms. We show that these field redefinitions exist and are
uniquely invertible if and only if the variation of the square-root matrix
itself has a unique solution, which is a requirement for the linearised theory

structure of ghost-free bimetric theory at the level of linear equations of

is responsible for the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost mode in the theory.
The bimetric scalar constraint is in general not manifestly covariant in its
nature. However, in the massive gravity limit the constraint assumes a
covariant form when one of the interaction parameters is set to zero. For that
case our analysis provides an alternative and almost trivial proof of the
absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost. Our findings generalise previous results
in the metric formulation of massive gravity and also agree with studies of its

we present a scalable distance driven feature learning framework based on the

effectiveness to handle the existing challenges. Specifically, given the
training images with the class labels (person IDs), we first produce a large
number of triplet units, each of which contains three images, i.e. one person
with a matched reference and a mismatched reference. Treating the units as the
input, we build the convolutional neural network to generate the layered
representations, and follow with the $L2$ distance metric. By means of
parameter optimization, our framework tends to maximize the relative distance
between the matched pair and the mismatched pair for each triplet unit.
Moreover, a nontrivial issue arising with the framework is that the triplet
organization cubically enlarges the number of training triplets, as one image
can be involved into several triplet units. To overcome this problem, we
develop an effective triplet generation scheme and an optimized gradient
descent algorithm, making the computational load mainly depends on the number
of original images instead of the number of triplets. On several challenging
databases, our approach achieves very promising results and outperforms other

of $r$ and where the greatest lower bound is equal to or smaller than $W(r,

customers have different characteristics and if passenger reviews about their

customer review data for in-flight services of airline companies and draw
customer models with respect to such data. In this sense, we apply two
approaches as feature-based and clustering-based modelling. In feature-based
modelling, customers are grouped into categories based on features such as
cabin flown types, experienced airline companies. In clustering-based
modelling, customers are first clustered via k-means clustering and then
modeled. We apply multivariate regression analysis to model customer groups in
both cases. During this, we try to understand how customers evaluate the given

non-interacting (invisible) states. The model was recently introduced to
explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental
observations of phase transitions in some systems where the $Z_q$-symmetry is
spontaneously broken. We analyse the marginal dimensions of the model, i.e.,
the value of $r$ at which the order of the phase transition changes. In the
$q=2$ case, we determine that value to be $r_c = 3.65(5)$; there is a
second-order phase transition there when $r<r_c$ and a first-order one at
$r>r_c$. We also analyse the region $1 \leq q<2$ and show that the change from
second to first order there is manifest through a new mechanism involving
{\emph{two}} marginal values of $r$. The $q=1$ limit gives bond percolation and
some intermediary values also have known physical realisations. Above the lower
value $r_{c1}$, the order parameters exhibit discontinuities at temperature
$\tilde{t}$ below a critical value $t_c$. But, provided $r>r_{c1}$ is small
enough, this discontinuity does not appear at the phase transition, which is
continuous and takes place at $t_c$. The larger value $r_{c2}$ marks the point
at which the phase transition at $t_c$ changes from second to first order.
Thus, for $r_{c1}< r < r_{c2}$, the transition at $t_c$ remains second order
while the order parameter has a discontinuity at $\tilde{t}$. As $r$ increases
further, $\tilde{t}$ increases, bringing the discontinuity closer to $t_c$.
Finally, when $r$ exceeds $r_{c2}$ $\tilde{t}$ coincides with $t_c$ and the
phase transition becomes first order. This new mechanism indicates how the
discontinuity characteristic of first order phase transitions emerges.

vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the entanglement generation
between the atoms as well as the degradation of entangled states in the
presence of an event horizon. We find that for a finite observation time the
atoms can become entangled for the case of the field in the Boulware vacuum
state, even if they are initially prepared in a separable state. In addition,
the rate of variation of atomic energy is not well behaved at the event horizon
due to the behavior of the proper accelerations of the atoms. We show that the
thermal nature of the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacuum state allows the atoms to
get entangled even if they were initially prepared in the separable ground

the $Z_c$ peak is due to a resonance with a mass around the $D\bar D^*$

which must have a hadronic molecular nature. In both cases the two

uncertainties, of a Markovian system, given noisy observations. It is
particularly difficult to achieve accurate filtering in complex dynamical
systems, such as those arising in turbulence, in which effective
low-dimensional representation of the desired probability distribution is
challenging. Nonetheless recent advances have shown considerable success in
filtering based on certain carefully chosen simplifications of the underlying
system, which allow closed form filters. This leads to filtering algorithms
with significant, but judiciously chosen, model error. The purpose of this
article is to analyze the effectiveness of these simplified filters, and to
suggest modifications of them which lead to improved filtering in certain
time-scale regimes. We employ a Markov switching process for the true signal
underlying the data, rather than working with a fully resolved DNS PDE model.
Such Markov switching models haven been demonstrated to provide an excellent
surrogate test-bed for the turbulent bursting phenomena which make filtering of

  the manuscript has a shorter abstract (due to arxiv restrictions)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the increase in per-sample differential entropy rate of random
sequences and processes after being passed through a non minimum-phase (NMP)
discrete-time, linear time-invariant (LTI) filter G. For such filters and
random processes, it has long been established that this entropy gain, Gain(G),
equals the integral of log|G(exp(jw))|. It is also known that, if the first
sample of the impulse response of G has unit-magnitude, then this integral
equals the sum of the logarithm of the magnitudes of the non-minimum phase
zeros of G, say B(G). In this note, we begin by showing that existing
time-domain proofs of these results, which consider finite length-n sequences
and then let n tend to infinity, have neglected significant mathematical terms
and, therefore, are inaccurate. We discuss some of the implications of this
oversight when considering random processes. We then present a rigorous
time-domain analysis of the entropy gain of LTI filters for random processes.
In particular, we show that the entropy gain between equal-length input and
output sequences is upper bounded by B(G) and arises if and only if there
exists an output additive disturbance with finite differential entropy (no
matter how small) or a random initial state. Instead, when comparing the input
differential entropy to that of the entire (longer) output of G, the entropy
gain equals B(G) without the need for additional exogenous random signals. We
illustrate some of the consequences of these results by presenting their
implications in three different problems. Specifically: a simple derivation of
the rate-distortion function for Gaussian non-stationary sources, conditions
for equality in an information inequality of importance in networked control
problems, and an observation on the capacity of auto-regressive Gaussian
channels with feedback.

investigate the effects of these mechanisms on the asymptotic period spacing of
gravity modes ($\Delta \Pi_1$) of red-giant stars that ignite He burning in
degenerate conditions (M$\lesssim$2.0 M$_{\odot}$). We also compare the
predictions of these models with Kepler observations. For a given $\Delta\nu$,
$\Delta \Pi_1$ depends not only on the stellar mass, but also on mixing
processes that can affect the structure of the core. We find that in the case
of more evolved red-giant-branch (RGB) stars and regardless of the transport
processes occurring in their interiors, the observed $\Delta \Pi_1$ can provide
information as to their stellar luminosity, within ~10-20%. In general, the
trends of $\Delta \Pi_1$ with respect to mass and metallicity that are observed
in Kepler red-giant stars are well reproduced by the models.

been and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By
which means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,
and eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions
our understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific
theories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems
to have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited
long ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical
properties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc
proposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that
biology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and
life-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and
diffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to
identify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.
While Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later
acclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th
century. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical
approach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long
forsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology
increasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the
mechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our
reluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.

that these bifurcate from solutions to the associated linear problem at zero

the number of zeros of the radial states. We construct numerical approximations

branches can be continued, numerically, to large mass values, where they become
asymptotic, under a rescaling, to those of the Schr\""odinger-Poisson problem

physical quantities in space-time points divided by space-like intervals may be
correlated. Though such correlation follows from the formulas of quantum
mechanics its physics so far remains unclear and there is a number of different
and rather contradictory interpretations. They concern particularly the
so-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox where the momentary action at a
distance together with non-local entangled states is used for the
interpretation.
  We assume that the quantum theory can be formulated as local and look for the
consequences of this assumption. Accordingly we try to explain the correlation
phenomena in a local way looking for the origin of correlation. To exclude a
presupposed correlation of participating quantum particles we consider two
independent particle sources and two detectors that are independent as well. We
show that the origin of the correlation is the feature that the occupation
number of a particle (and other its measurable quantities) is formed by a pair
of complex conjugated wave functions with in general arbitrary phases. We
consider this point as crucial as it provides interpretation of the observed
correlation phenomena that may otherwise look puzzling.
  We briefly discuss a special type of noise that is typical for the quantum
correlation phenomena.

mechanism in the onset regime for both flexible polymers and rigid fibers.
Since fibers do not have an elastic backbone, this must be a viscous effect.
Analysis of the viscosity tensor reveals that all terms are negligible, except
the off-diagonal shear viscosity associated with rotation. Based on this
analysis, we identify the rotational orientation time as the unifying time
scale setting a new time criterion for drag reduction by both flexible polymers

partial differential equation with non-local boundary condition famous in the
field of population dynamics, where the {\it age} of a neuron is the amount of

investigate the mathematical connection between the two formalisms. We shall

penetrating thinker whose work centered on some of the most significant
physical and philosophical questions of his era at their nexus. He approached
these questions with an open, agile and critical mind, something quickly
evident to anyone who had the privilege of conversing with him. His choice of
problems to pursue, which for the most part involved epistemology and the
relationships between mind, matter and space-time, was visionary. Undoubtedly,
most of the discussions of Abner Shimony's work in future will center on his
enormous contribution to the investigation of the significance to physics, both
theoretical and experimental, of quantum entanglement, the characteristic of
physical entities on which his work came to concentrate, well represented in
the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality. Also significant for physics is
his pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the
early-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship
between knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical
concerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se.
Indeed, the most well known phrase he coined is ""experimental metaphysics."" He
is also known for the reapplication of the expression ""peaceful coexistence"" as
pertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special
relativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the
question of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few
physicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more
philosophical and less mathematically tractable character. This appreciation
reflects all these aspects of Abner Shimony's long and successful intellectual
career, in addition to details of his education, including mention of some of
his teachers.

The dynamics is reduced to the 2D sewn dynamical system of a Newtonian type (a
piecewise-smooth dynamical system). We classify all evolutional paths in the
model as well as trajectories in the phase space. We demonstrate the presence
of a degenerate freeze singularity (glued freeze type singularities) for the
positive $\gamma$. In this case it is a generic feature of early evolution of
the universe. We point out that a degenerate type III of singularity can be
considered as an endogenous model of inflation between the matter dominating
epoch and the dark energy phase. We also investigate cosmological models with
negative $\gamma$. It is demonstrated that $\gamma$ equal zero is a bifurcation
parameter and dynamics qualitatively changes in comparison to positive
$\gamma$. Instead of the big bang the sudden bounce singularity of a finite
scale factor appears and there is a generic class of bouncing solutions sewn
along the line $a=a_{\text{sing}}$. And we argue that the presence of sudden
singularities in an evolutional scenario of the Universe falsifies the negative
$\gamma$ in the Palatini cosmology. Only very small values of $\Omega_{\gamma}$
parameter are admissible if we requires that agreements physics with the
$\Lambda$CDM model. From the statistical analysis of astronomical observations,
we deduce that the case of negative values of $\Omega_\gamma$ can be rejected
even if it may fit better to the data.

octonion space as the dark matter field, describing some properties of dark
matter, especially the origin, particle category, existence region, and force
and so forth. Since J. C. Maxwell applied the algebra of quaternions to depict
the electromagnetic theory, some scholars adopt the complex quaternion and
octonion to study the physics property of electromagnetic and gravitational
fields. In the paper, by means of the octonion operator, it is found that the
gravitational field accompanies with one adjoint-field, which property is
partly similar to that of electromagnetic field. And the electromagnetic field
accompanies with another adjoint-field, which feature is partly similar to that
of gravitational field. As a result the electromagnetic adjoint-field is able
to be chosen as one candidate of the dark matter field. According to the
electromagnetic adjoint-field, it is able to predict a few properties of dark
matter, for instance, the particle category, interaction intensity, interaction
distance, and existence region and so forth. The study reveals that the dark
matter particle and gravitational resource both will be influenced by the
gravitational strength and force. The dark matter field is capable of making a
contribution to physics quantities of gravitational field, including the
angular momentum, torque, energy, and force and so on. Further there may be

large-amplitude bursts attributed to filament structures moving through the
scrape-off layer. The average burst shape is well described by a
double-exponential wave-form with constant duration, while the waiting times

Associated with bursts in the ion saturation current is a dipole shaped
floating potential structure and radially outwards directed electric drift
velocity and particle flux, with average peak values increasing with the
saturation current burst amplitude. The floating potential fluctuations have a
normal probability density function while the distributions for the ion

explanatory value of this approach is presented in greater detail. The
presented results are integrated in a wider comparison of five late medieval
polities across Afro-Eurasia (Byzantium, China, England, Hungary and Mamluk
Egypt) against the background of the {\guillemotright}Late Medieval
Crisis{\guillemotleft} and its political and environmental turmoil. Finally,
further perspectives of COMMED are outlined.
