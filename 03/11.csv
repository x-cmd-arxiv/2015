is an interesting dark matter candidate, leading to LHC signatures which can be
quite distinct from those of the conventional neutralino LSP. Using
SModelSv1.0.1 for testing the model against the limits published by ATLAS and
CMS in the context of so-called Simplified Model Spectra (SMS), we investigate
to what extent the supersymmetry searches at Run 1 of the LHC constrain the
sneutrino-LSP scenario. Moreover, we discuss the most relevant topologies for
which no SMS results are provided by the experimental collaborations but which
would allow to put more stringent constraints on sneutrino LSPs. These include,
for instance, the mono-lepton signature which should be particularly
interesting to consider at Run 2 of the LHC.

generated by a decision procedure on the simplified clause set can then either
be lifted to a refutation in the original clause set, or it guides a refinement

Results. Both temporal and spectral analysis suggest a two-component model to

defined by observations, which must be met by physical models that describe the
flickering. In particular, time lags in the occurrence of flickering events at
different wavelengths over the optical range are examined. To this end, the
cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of numerous light curves of a sample of CVs
are analysed that were observed simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously in
different bands of various photometric systems. Deviations of the maxima of the
CCFs from zero time-shift indicate a dependence of the flickering activity on
the wavelength in the sense that flickering flares reach their maxima slightly
earlier in the blue range than in the red. While the available observational
material does not permit detecting this individually in all observed systems,
the ensemble of all data clearly shows this effect. Particularly instructive
are the cases of V603 Aql and TT Ari, where time lags of 15.1 sec and 4.3 sec,
respectively, are observed between the U and R bands. In principle this can be
understood if during the development of a flickering flare the radiation
characteristics of the light source responsible for flickering change such that
in the early phases of a flare more short-wavelength radiation is emitted, and
later on, the peak of the emission shifts to the red. Respective scenarios are
discussed and shown to be in qualitative and quantitative agreement with
observations.

setup as an ideal emitter of individual quasiparticles and electrons into
fractional quantum Hall edge channels of the Laughlin sequence. Our treatment
relies on a master equation approach and identifies the optimal regime of
operation for both types of sources. The quasiparticle/quasihole emission
regime involves in practice only two charge states of the antidot, allowing for
an analytic treatment. We show the precise quantization of the emitted charge,
we determine its optimal working regime, and we compute the phase noise/shot
noise crossover as a function of the escape time from the emitter. The emission
of electrons, which calls for a larger amplitude of the drive, requires a full
numerical treatment of the master equations as more quasiparticle charge states
are involved. Nevertheless, in this case the emission of one electron charge
followed by one hole per period can also be achieved, and the overall shape of
the noise spectrum is similar to that of the quasiparticle source, but the
presence of additional quasiparticle processes enhances the noise amplitude.

the bias-variance trade-off: low biased estimators tend to have high variance
and low variance estimators tend to have high bias. In 1982, Thomson introduced
a multitaper method where this trade-off is made explicit by choosing a target
bias resolution and obtaining a corresponding variance reduction. The method
became the standard in many applications. Its favorable bias-variance trade-off
is due to an empirical fact, conjectured by Thomson based on numerical
evidence: assuming bandwidth W and N time domain observations, the average of
the square of the first $K=\left\lfloor 2NW\right\rfloor$ Slepian functions
approaches, as K grows, an ideal band-pass kernel for the interval [-W,W]. We
provide an analytic proof of this fact and quantify the approximation error in
the L1 norm; the approximation error is then used to control the bias of the
multitaper estimator resulting from spectral leakage. This leads to new
performance bounds for the method, explicit in terms of the bandwidth W and the
number N of time domain observations. Our method is flexible and can be
extended to higher dimensions and different geometries.

unclear how to assess its transferability while applying to a much different

potential method developed for exchange functional, we demonstrate that the LPP
can be constructed optimally from the NCPP for a large number of elements. Our
theory also reveals that the existence of an LPP is intrinsic to the elements,
irrespective to the parameters used for the construction. Our method provides a
unified method in constructing and assessing LPP in the framework of first

Standard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses in the Higgs
sector a precise knowledge of their decay properties is mandatory. We evaluate
all two-body decay modes of the Higgs bosons into charginos and neutralinos in
the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). The evaluation is based on a full
one-loop calculation of all decay channels, also including hard QED radiation.
We restricted ourselves to a version of our renormalization scheme which is
valid for |M_1| < |M_2|, |mu| and M_2 != mu to simplify the analysis, even
though we are able to switch to other parameter regions. The dependence of the
Higgs boson predictions on the relevant cMSSM parameters is analyzed
numerically. We find sizable contributions to many partial decay widths. They
are roughly of 10% of the tree-level results, but can go up to 20% or higher.
The full one-loop contributions are important for the correct interpretation of
heavy Higgs boson search results at the LHC and, if kinematically allowed, at a
future linear e+e- collider. It is planned to implement the evaluation of the
branching ratios of the Higgs bosons into the Fortran code FeynHiggs, together
with an automated choice of the renormalization scheme valid for the full cMSSM
parameter space.

CRs, the issue of whether they can accelerate protons up to PeV remains
unsolved. Here we discuss particle acceleration at the forward shock of SN and
discuss the possibility that the escaping particle current may excite a
non-resonant instability that in turn leads to the formation of resonant modes
confining particles close to the shock and increasing the maximum energy. This
mechanism works throughout the expansion of the SN explosion, from the ejecta
dominated (ED) to the Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase. Because of their higher
explosion rate,we focus on type II SNae expanding in the slow, dense red
supergiant wind. When the explosion occurs in such winds, the transition
between the ED and the ST phase is likely to take place within a few tens of
years. As a result, the spectrum of accelerated particles shows a break in the
slope, at the maximum energy (Em) achieved at the beginning of the ST phase.
Above this energy, the spectrum becomes steeper but remains a power law than
developing an exponential cutoff. We show that for type II SNae typical
parameters, proton Em can easily reach PeV energies, confirming that type II
SNRs are the best candidate sources for CRs at the knee. We have tried to fit
KASCADE-Grande, ARGO -YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array data with our model but we could
not find any parameter combination that could explain all data sets. Indeed the
recent measurement of the proton and helium spectra in the knee region, with
the ARGO-YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array, has made the situation very confused. These
measurements suggest that the knee in the light component is at 650 TeV,
appreciably below the overall spectrum knee. This finding would resolve the
problem of reaching very high energies in SNae, but, on the other hand, it
would open a critical issue in the transition region between Galactic and
extragalactic CRs.

techniques, which avoids the bottleneck caused by the Truncated SVD (TSVD).
Instead, a polar factorization is used to exploit the manifold structure of
fixed-rank problems as the product of two Stiefel and an SPD manifold, leading
to a better convergence and stability. Then, closed-form projectors help to
speed up each iteration of the method. We introduce a novel and fast projector
for the $\text{SPD}$ manifold and a proof of its validity. Further acceleration
is achieved using a Nystrom scheme. Extensive experiments with synthetic and

$c_u$-adjacencies that are homotopic but not pointed homotopic. For two digital
loops $f,g: [0,m]_Z \rightarrow X$ with the same basepoint, we introduce the
notion of {\em tight at the basepoint (TAB)} pointed homotopy, which is more
restrictive than ordinary pointed homotopy and yields some different results.
  We present a variant form of the digital fundamental group. Based on what we
call {\em eventually constant} loops, this version of the fundamental group is
equivalent to that of Boxer (1999), but offers the advantage that eventually
constant maps are often easier to work with than the trivial extensions that
are key to the development of the fundamental group in Boxer (1999) and many
subsequent papers.
  We show that homotopy equivalent digital images have isomorphic fundamental
groups, even when the homotopy equivalence does not preserve the basepoint.
This assertion appeared in Boxer (2005), but there was an error in the proof;
here, we correct the error.

with accretion flows toward the clumps and cores. The moderate luminosity and
the chemical signatures indicate that the five cores harbor low- to

lack of a distributed low-mass protostellar population in the clump. Our
observations indicate that in a protocluster, low-mass stars form at a later

industry, policy makers, economists, citizens and scientists have engaged in a
discussion that is centred around the means to integrate the new generation of
the sharing economy services in urban ecosystems. In this work, we aim to shed
new light on the discussion, by taking advantage of a publicly available
longitudinal dataset that describes the mobility of yellow taxis in New York
City. In addition to movement, this data contains information on the fares paid
by the taxi customers for each trip. As a result we are given the opportunity
to provide a first head to head comparison between the iconic yellow taxi and
its modern competitor, Uber, in one of the world's largest metropolitan
centres. We identify situations when Uber X, the cheapest version of the Uber
taxi service, tends to be more expensive than yellow taxis for the same
journey. We also demonstrate how Uber's economic model effectively takes
advantage of well known patterns in human movement. Finally, we take our
analysis a step further by proposing a new mobile application that compares
taxi prices in the city to facilitate traveller's taxi choices, hoping to
ultimately to lead to a reduction of commuter costs. Our study provides a case
on how big datasets that become public can improve urban services for consumers
by offering the opportunity for transparency in economic sectors that lack up

the second order formalism -with metric variables- who showed that the
Regge-Teitelboim formalism yields a consistent Hamiltonian description where,
surprisingly, the energy is bounded from below and from above. The energy of
the spacetime is, however, determined up to an arbitrary constant. The natural
choice was to fix that freedom such that Minkowski spacetime has zero energy.
More recently, Marolf and Pati\~no started from the Einstein-Hilbert action
supplemented with the Gibbons-Hawking term and showed that, in the 2+1
decomposition of the theory, the energy is shifted from the
Ashtekar-Varadarajan analysis in such a way that Minkowski spacetime possesses
a negative energy. In this contribution we consider the first order formalism,
where the fundamental variables are a so(2,1) connection $\omega_a{^I}_J$ and a
triad $e_a^I$. We consider two actions. A natural extension to 3 dimensions of
the consistent action in 4D Palatini gravity is shown to be finite and
differentiable. For this action, the 2+1 decomposition (that we perform using
two methods) yields a Hamiltonian boundary term that corresponds to energy. It
assigns zero energy to Minkowski spacetime. We then put forward a totally gauge
invariant action, and show that it is also well defined and differentiable.
Interestingly, it turns out to be related, on shell, to the 3D Palatini action
by an additive constant in such a way that its associated energy is given by
the Marolf-Pati\~no expression. Thus, we conclude that, from the perspective of
the first order formalism, Minkowski spacetime can consistently have either,
zero, or a negative energy equal to -1/4G, depending on the choice of
consistent action employed as starting point.

falling on a wavy surface may have a marked tendency to dampen the shorter

that on the whole this should imply stronger wind and higher waves in the most
energetic part of the spectrum. This is supported by numerical experiments.
However, a verification based on the comparison between operational model
results and measured data suggests that the opposite is true. This leads to a
keen analysis of the overall process, in particular on the role of the tail of
the spectrum in modulating the wind input and the white-capping. We suggest
that the relationship between white-capping and generation by wind is deeper

due to the limited length of light curves. A parameter $\beta$ based on
structure functions is introduced to quantitively describe the asymmetry and
its uncertainty is measured using extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Individual
sources show no evidence of asymmetry at timescales of $1\sim20$ days and there
is not a general trend toward positive or negative asymmetry over the whole
sample. Stacking data of all 19 AGNs, we derive averaged $\bar{\beta}$ of
0.00$\pm$0.03 and -0.02$\pm$0.04 over timescales of 1$\sim$5 days and 5$\sim$20
days, respectively, statistically consistent with zero. Quasars and Seyfert
galaxies show similar asymmetry parameters. Our results indicate that short
term optical variations in AGNs are highly symmetric.

scatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with the off-shell partons whose masses

reproduces the lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The
relevant cross section are calculated in a consistent way by employing the
effective propagators and couplings from the DQPM. Close to the critical energy
density of the phase transition, the charm quarks are hadronized into $D$
mesons through coalescence and/or fragmentation depending on transverse
momentum. The hadronized $D$ mesons then interact with the various hadrons in
the hadronic phase with cross sections calculated in an effective lagrangian
approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry. Finally, the nuclear modification
factor $\rm R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D^0$ mesons from PHSD are
compared with the experimental data from the STAR Collaboration for Au+Au

loss of $D$ mesons at high $p_T$ can be dominantly attributed to partonic
scattering while the actual shape of $\rm R_{AA}$ versus $p_T$ reflects the
heavy quark hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation. Also
the hadronic rescattering is important for the $\rm R_{AA}$ at low $p_T$ and
enhances the $D$-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.

ghost-free massive gravity theory by using the Gordon ansatz. For these
solutions the physical metric can be conveniently viewed as describing a
hyperboloid in 5D Minkowski space, while the flat reference metric depends on
the Stuckelberg field $T(t,r)$ that satisfies the equation
$(\partial_t{T})^2-(\partial_r T)^2=1$. This equation has infinitely many
solutions, hence there are infinitely many de Sitter vacua with different
physical properties. Only the simplest solution with $T=t$ has been previously
studied since it is manifestly homogeneous and isotropic, but it is unstable.
However, other solutions could be stable. We require the timelike isometry to
be common for both metrics, and this gives physically distinguished solutions
since only for them the canonical energy is time-independent. We conjecture
that these solutions minimize the energy and are therefore stable. We also show
that in some cases solutions can be homogeneous and isotropic in a non-manifest
way such that their symmetries are not obvious. All of this suggests that the

scenario, mass splittings between different dark matter flavors are determined
by Standard Model Yukawa couplings and can naturally be small, allowing all
three flavors to be long-lived and contribute to the observed abundance. Then,
in the presence of a tiny source of flavor violation, heavier dark matter
flavors can decay via a dipole transition on cosmological timescales, giving
rise to three photon lines. The ratios of the line energies are completely
determined in terms of the charged lepton masses, and constitute a firm
prediction of this framework. For dark matter masses of order the weak scale,
the couplet lies in the keV-MeV region, with a much weaker line in the eV-keV
region. This scenario constitutes a potential explanation for the recent claim
of the observation of a 3.5 keV line. The next generation of X-ray telescopes
may have the necessary resolution to resolve the double line structure of such
a couplet.

building, neutrino mass phenomenology and the Dark Matter abundance. In the
context of the inverse seesaw we find a favoured scenario with heavy
pseudo-Dirac sterile neutrinos at the TeV scale, which in the conformal
framework conspire with the electro-weak scale to generate keV scale warm Dark
Matter. The mass scale relations provide naturally the correct relic abundance
due to a freeze-in mechanism. We demonstrate also how conformal symmetry
decouples the right-handed neutrino mass scale and effective lepton number
violation. We find that lepton flavour violating processes can be well within
the reach of modern experiments. Furthermore, interesting decay signatures are

obtaining the potential of disc galaxies from surface density images, assuming
a vertical density distribution (height function), which is let to vary with
position, thus enabling it to represent the geometry of a B/P. We construct a
B/P height function after the results from a high-resolution, N-body+SPH
simulation of an isolated galaxy and compare the resulting dynamical model to
those obtained with the commonly used, position-independent ""flat"" height
functions. We show that methods that do not allow for a B/P can induce errors
in the forces in the bar region of up to 40% and demonstrate that this has a
significant impact on the orbital structure of the model, which in turn
determines its kinematics and morphology. Furthermore, we show that the bar
strength is reduced in the presence of a B/P. We conclude that neglecting the
vertical extent of a B/P can introduce considerable errors in the dynamical
modelling. We also examine the errors introduced in the model due to
uncertainties in the parameters of the B/P and show that even for generous but
realistic values of the uncertainties, the error will be noticeably less than
that of not modelling a B/P bulge at all.

material required to explain the abundance anomalies seen in ancient globular
clusters (GCs). Most studies to date have compared the yields from potential
sources (asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), fast rotating massive stars
(FRMS), high mass interacting binaries (IBs), and very massive stars (VMS))
with observations of specific elements that are observed to vary from
star-to-star in GCs, focussing on extreme GCs such as NGC 2808, which display
large He variations. However, a consistency check between the results of
fitting extreme cases with the requirements of more typical clusters, has
rarely been done. Such a check is particularly timely given the constraints on
He abundances in GCs now available. Here we show that all of the popular
enrichment sources fail to reproduce the observed trends in GCs, focussing
primarily on Na, O and He. In particular, we show that any model that can fit
clusters like NGC 2808, will necessarily fail (by construction) to fit more
typical clusters like 47 Tuc or NGC 288. All sources severely over-produce He
for most clusters. Additionally, given the large differences in He spreads
between clusters, but similar spreads observed in Na--O, only sources with
large degrees of stochasticity in the resulting yields will be able to fit the
observations. We conclude that no enrichment source put forward so far (AGBs,
FRMS, IBs, VMS - or combinations thereof) is consistent with the observations
of GCs. Finally, the observed trends of increasing [N/Fe] and He spread with
increasing cluster mass cannot be resolved within a self-enrichment framework,
without further exacerbating the mass budget problem.

in terms of preformed, uncondensed pairs. Here we show that the occurrence of
pseudogap physics can be consistently understood in terms of local excitations
which lead to a splitting of the quasiparticle peak for sufficiently large
interaction. This effect becomes prominent at intermediate and high
temperatures when the quantum mechanical hopping is incoherent. We clarify the
existence of a conjectured temperature below which pseudogap physics is
expected to occur. Our results are based on approximating the physics of the

Reverberation Mapping Project, during which 32 epochs of spectroscopy were
obtained with the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey spectrograph. We
observe significant (>4sigma) variability in the equivalent width of the broad
(~4000 km/s wide) CIV trough on rest-frame timescales as short as 1.20 days
(~29 hours), the shortest broad absorption line variability timescale yet
reported. The equivalent width varied by ~10% on these short timescales, and by
about a factor of two over the duration of the campaign. We evaluate several
potential causes of the variability, concluding that the most likely cause is a
rapid response to changes in the incident ionizing continuum. If the outflow is
at a radius where the recombination rate is higher than the ionization rate,
the timescale of variability places a lower limit on the density of the
absorbing gas of n_e > 3.9 x 10^5 cm^-3. The broad absorption line variability
characteristics of this quasar are consistent with those observed in previous
studies of quasars, indicating that such short-term variability may in fact be
common and thus can be used to learn about outflow characteristics and
contributions to quasar/host-galaxy feedback scenarios.

their host system, resulting in free-floating planets (FFPs). If this occurs in
a star cluster, the FFP may remain bound to the star cluster for some time and
interact with the other cluster members until it is ejected. Here, we use
$N$-body simulations to characterise close star-planet and planet-planet
encounters and the dynamical fate of the FFP population in star clusters
containing $500-2000$ single or binary star members. We find that FFPs ejected
from their planetary system at low velocities typically leave the star cluster
40% earlier than their host stars, and experience tens of close ($<1000$ AU)
encounters with other stars and planets before they escape. The fraction of
FFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and
the initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close
encounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10% occur after 100 Myr. The
periastron velocity distribution for all encounters is well-described by a
modified Maxwell-Bolzmann distribution, and the periastron distance
distribution is linear over almost the entire range of distances considered,
and flattens off for very close encounters due to strong gravitational
focusing. Close encounters with FFPs can perturb existing planetary systems and
their debris structures, and they can result in re-capture of FFPs. In
addition, these FFP populations may be observed in young star clusters in
imaging surveys; a comparison between observations and dynamical predictions
may provide clues to the early phases of stellar and planetary dynamics in star
clusters.

perform a standard abundance analysis to derive abundances of 43 species of 39
elements, including 20 elements heavier than the iron group. We derive <[Fe/H]>
= -2.25 +/- 0.02 from Fe I lines and <[Fe/H> = -2.19 +/- 0.013 from Fe II
lines. We confirm earlier results that found no internal metallicity spread in
NGC 4833, and there are no significant star-to-star abundance dispersions among
any elements in the iron group (19 <= Z <= 30). We recover the usual abundance
variations among the light elements C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, and possibly Si. The
heavy-element distribution reflects enrichment by r-process nucleosynthesis
([Eu/Fe] = +0.36 +/- 0.03), as found in many other metal-poor globular
clusters. We investigate small star-to-star variations found among the
neutron-capture elements, and we conclude that these are probably not real
variations. Upper limits on the Th abundance, log epsilon (Th/Eu) < -0.47 +/-
0.09, indicate that NGC 4833, like other globular clusters where Th has been
studied, did not experience a so-called ""actinide boost.""

gauge-fixing a purely bosonic classical action involving a twistor-like

a d=10 pure spinor. This twistor-like constraint replaces the usual Virasoro

spacetime spinor variables $\theta^\alpha$ arise as Faddeev-Popov ghosts for
this constraint.
  In this paper, the purely bosonic classical action is simplified by replacing
the classical d=10 pure spinor $\lambda^\alpha$ with a d=10 projective pure
spinor. The pure spinor and Green-Schwarz formalisms for the superparticle and
superstring are then obtained as different gauge-fixings of this purely bosonic
classical action, and the Green-Schwarz kappa symmetry is directly related to
the pure spinor BRST symmetry. Since a d=10 projective pure spinor
parameterizes ${{SO(10)}\over{U(5)}}$, this action can be interpreted as a
standard $\hat c=5$ topological action where one integrates over the
${{SO(10)}\over{U(5)}}$ choice of complex structure. Finally, a purely bosonic
action for the d=11 supermembrane is proposed which reduces upon
double-dimensional reduction to the purely bosonic action for the d=10 Type IIA

layer with plasma b=1 and the transition region, and get converted, reflected
and refracted. Understanding the mechanisms by which MHD waves can reach the
corona can give us information about the solar atmosphere and the magnetic
structures. We carry out two-dimensional numerical simulations of wave
propagation in a magnetic field structure that consists of two vertical flux
tubes separated by an arcade shaped magnetic field. This configuration contains
a null point in the corona, that significantly modifies the behaviour of the
waves. We describe in detail the wave propagation through the atmosphere under
different driving conditions. We also present the spatial distribution of the
mean acoustic and magnetic energy fluxes and the spatial distribution of the
dominant frequencies in the whole domain. We conclude that the energy reaches
the corona preferably along vertical magnetic fields, inside the flux tubes,
and it has an acoustic nature. Most of the magnetic energy keeps concentrated
below the transition region due to the refraction of the magnetic waves and the
continuous conversion of acoustic-like waves into fast magnetic waves in the
equipartition layer located in the photosphere. However, part of the magnetic
energy reaches the low corona when propagating in the region where the arcades
are located, but waves are sent back downwards to the lower atmosphere at the
null point surroundings. This phenomenon, together with the reflection and
refraction of waves in the TR and the lower turning point, act as a re-feeding
of the atmosphere. In the frequency distribution, we find that high frequency
waves can reach the corona outside the vertical flux tubes.

Kuiper Belt. The non-uniform ring-like structure around epsilon Eridani,
originally discovered at lambda=850 microns with the bolometer camera SCUBA,
could be the signpost of unseen long-period planets interior to the disk that
gravitationally interact with it through mean-motion resonances. However, the
reliability of the structure at 850 microns, which has been debated, has not
been verified with independent observations until now. We present a high
signal-to-noise ratio image of this structure at lambda=1.2 mm made with the
bolometer camera MAMBO and compare this with the SCUBA image. We have found
that three of the four emission clumps (NE, NW, SW) and the two deep hollows to
the east and west are at the same positions in the MAMBO and SCUBA images
within astrometric uncertainty. The SE clump is at odds, significantly brighter
and more extended in the SCUBA than in the MAMBO images, but it is possible
that this mismatch is an artifact. We conclude that this degree of positional
coincidence provides tentative evidence that the observed structure is robust.
In addition, we present the radial brightness profile of our MAMBO image and
show that the width of the planetesimal belt around epsilon Eridani is narrower
than 22 AU, a more stringent upper limit than determined from previous
observations. The corresponding relative width is $0.1 < \Delta R / R < 0.4$,

provides an upper limit. This two-sided bound has lead to the emergence of
Mini-Split theories where gauginos are not far removed from the electroweak
scale while scalars are somewhat heavier. This small hierarchy modifies the
spectrum of standard anomaly and gauge mediation, leading to Mini-Split
deflected anomaly and gauge mediation models. In this paper, we study LHC
constraints on these models and their prospects at LHC 14 and a 100 TeV
collider. Current constraints on their parameter space come from ATLAS and CMS
supersymmetry searches, the known mass of the Higgs boson, and the absence of a
color-breaking vacuum. Prospects at LHC 14 and a 100 TeV collider are obtained
from these same theoretical constraints in conjunction with background
estimates. As would be expected from renormalization group effects, a slightly
lighter third generation of squarks is assumed. Higgsinos have masses similar
to those of the scalars and are at the origin of the deflection.

strong coupling of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) to off-resonant
optical fields. We demonstrate that the magnetic LFE gives rise to a previously
unexplored mechanism for coupling a (pseudo) spinor BEC or fermion gas to
microwaves (MWs). We present a theory for the magnetic LFE, and find that it
gives rise to a short-range attractive interaction between two components of
the (pseudo) spinor, and a long-range interaction between them. The latter
interaction, resulting from deformation of the magnetic field, is locally
repulsive but globally attractive, in sharp contrast with its counterpart for
the optical LFE, produced by phase modulation of the electric field. Our
analytical results, confirmed by the numerical computations, show that the
long-range interaction gives rise to modulational instability of the spatially
uniform state, and creates stable ground states in the form of hybrid
matter-wave-microwave solitons (which seem like one-dimensional magnetic
monopoles), with a size much smaller than the MW wavelength, even in the
presence of arbitrarily strong contact inter-component repulsion. The setting
is somewhat similar to exciton-polaritonic condensates in semiconductor
microcavities. The release of matter waves from the soliton may be used for the
realization of an atom laser. The analysis also applies to molecular BECs with
rotational states coupled by the electric MW field.

the nice properties of splay trees follow from it. What makes self-adjusting
binary search trees (BSTs) satisfy the access lemma? After each access,
self-adjusting BSTs replace the search path by a tree on the same set of nodes
(the after-tree). We identify two simple combinatorial properties of the search
path and the after-tree that imply the access lemma. Our main result (i)
implies the access lemma for all minimally self-adjusting BST algorithms for
which it was known to hold: splay trees and their generalization to the class
of local algorithms (Subramanian, Georgakopoulos and Mc-Clurkin), as well as
Greedy BST, introduced by Demaine et al. and shown to satisfy the access lemma
by Fox, (ii) implies that BST algorithms based on ""strict"" depth-halving
satisfy the access lemma, addressing an open question that was raised several
times since 1985, and (iii) yields an extremely short proof for the O(log n log
log n) amortized access cost for the path-balance heuristic (proposed by
Sleator), matching the best known bound (Balasubramanian and Raman) to a
lower-order factor.
  One of our combinatorial properties is locality. We show that any
BST-algorithm that satisfies the access lemma via the sum-of-log (SOL)
potential is necessarily local. The other property states that the sum of the
number of leaves of the after-tree plus the number of side alternations in the
search path must be at least a constant fraction of the length of the search
path. We show that a weak form of this property is necessary for sequential
access to be linear.

analyzed the variable absorption seen in these observations in order to
characterize the geometry of the absorbing material. Two of the observations
caught NGC 1365 in an unusually low absorption state, revealing complexity in
the multi-layer absorber which had previously been hidden. We find the need for
three distinct zones of neutral absorption in addition to the two zones of
ionized absorption and the Compton-thick torus previously seen in this source.
The most prominent absorber is likely associated with broad line region clouds
with column densities of around $\sim\,$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a highly clumpy
nature as evidenced by an occultation event in February 2013. We also find
evidence of a patchy absorber with a variable column around $\sim\,10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$ and a line of sight covering fraction of 0.3$-$0.9 which responds
directly to the intrinsic source flux, possibly due to a wind geometry. A
full-covering, constant absorber with a low column density of $\sim\,1 \times$
10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ is also present, though the location of this low density
haze is unknown.

geometry that has resulted in a number of interesting and long-standing
problems. Swanepoel introduced the covering parameter of a convex body as a
means of quantifying its covering properties. In this paper, we introduce two
relatives of the covering parameter called covering index and weak covering
index, which upper bound well-studied quantities like the illumination number,
the illumination parameter and the covering parameter of a convex body.
Intuitively, the two indices measure how well a convex body can be covered by a
relatively small number of homothets having the same relatively small homothety
ratio. We show that the covering index is a lower semicontinuous functional on
the Banach-Mazur space of convex bodies. We further show that the affine
d-cubes minimize covering index in any dimension d, while circular disks
maximize it in the plane. Furthermore, the covering index satisfies a nice
compatibility with the operations of direct vector sum and vector sum. In fact,
we obtain an exact formula for the covering index of a direct vector sum of
convex bodies that works in infinitely many instances. This together with a
minimization property can be used to determine the covering index of infinitely
many convex bodies. As the name suggests, the weak covering index loses some of
the important properties of the covering index. Finally, we obtain upper bounds
on the covering and weak covering index.

An explicit calculation shows that, at the first order, the condensate $< {\bar

non-integrable IR divergence in 3D, while in 4D it exhibits a logarithmic UV
divergence, being proportional to the Gribov parameter $\gamma^2$. These
results indicate that in 3D the transverse spatial Coulomb gluon two-point
correlation function exhibits a scaling behaviour, in agreement with Gribov's
expression. In 4D, however, they suggest that, next to the scaling behaviour, a
decoupling solution might emerge too.

nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation by including the nonlinear phenomena of
self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM) but ignoring
four-wave mixing (FWM), polarization effects and group velocity dispersion
(GVD) within WDM bands. The first model also ignores GVD across WDM bands,
referred to as group velocity mistmatch (GVM). For the case of two users, a new
technique called ""interference focusing"" is proposed where each carrier
achieves the capacity pre-log 1, thereby doubling the pre-log of 1/2 achieved
by using conventional methods. For three users, interference focusing is also
useful under certain conditions. The second model captures GVM and the effect
of filtering at the receivers in addition to SPM and XPM. In a 3-user system,

machines (straggling tasks) become the bottleneck in the job completion.
Computing frameworks such as MapReduce and Spark tackle this by replicating the
straggling tasks and waiting for any one copy to finish. Despite being adopted
in practice, there is little analysis of how replication affects the latency
and the cost of additional computing resources. In this paper we provide a
framework to analyze this latency-cost trade-off and find the best replication
strategy by answering design questions such as: 1) when to replicate straggling
tasks, 2) how many replicas to launch, and 3) whether to kill the original copy
or not. Our analysis reveals that for certain execution time distributions, a
small amount of task replication can drastically reduce both latency as well as
the cost of computing resources. We also propose an algorithm to estimate the
latency and cost based on the empirical distribution of task execution time.
Evaluations using samples in the Google Cluster Trace suggest further latency
and cost reduction compared to the existing replication strategy used in
MapReduce.

Wiener phase noise and additive white Gaussian noise. A discrete-time channel
model that takes into account the effect of filtering on the phase noise is
developed. The model is based on a multi-sample receiver, i.e., an
integrate-and-dump filter whose output is sampled at a rate higher than the
signaling rate. It is shown that, at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the
multi-sample receiver achieves a rate that grows logarithmically with the SNR
if the number of samples per symbol (oversampling factor) grows with the cubic
root of the SNR. Moreover, the pre-log factor is at least 1/2 and can be
achieved by amplitude modulation. For an approximate discrete-time model of the
multi-sample receiver, the capacity pre-log at high SNR is shown to be at least
3/4 if the number of samples per symbol grows with the square root of the SNR.
The analysis shows that phase modulation achieves a pre-log of at least 1/4
while amplitude modulation still achieves a pre-log of 1/2. This is strictly
greater than the capacity pre-log of the (approximate) discrete-time Wiener
phase noise channel with only one sample per symbol, which is 1/2. Numerical
simulations are used to compute lower bounds on the information rates achieved
by the multi-sample receiver. The simulations show that oversampling is
beneficial for both strong and weak phase noise at high SNR. In fact, the
information rates are sometimes substantially larger than when using
commonly-used approximate discrete-time models.

generalized the nonexistence result to higher dimensions. G.Bianchi and
E.Egnell [1] suggested that there may exist some non-negative smooth radial
function which cannot be scalar curvature in the standard conformal class of
$RP^n.$ However, in our paper, we prove that all smooth radial non-negative
smooth functions which are positive on the pole could be prescribing scalar
curvatures. We consider the quotient $\frac{v_\lambda}{V_\lambda}$ rather than
the difference $v_\lambda-V_\lambda$ as in [1]. This trick yields a concise
argument of the existence. Consequently, their counter examples stated in [1]
cannot be true on $RP^n.$

HI properties of the galaxies in the environment of our targeted galaxies. In
total, we extract 65 galaxies from the WSRT cubes with stellar masses between
$10^8M_{\odot}$ and $10^{11}M_{\odot}$. Most of these galaxies are located on
the same HI mass-size relation and ""HI-plane"" as normal spiral galaxies. We
find that companions around HI-rich galaxies tend to be HI-rich as well and to
have larger R90,HI/R50,HI. This suggests a scenario of ""HI conformity"", similar
to the colour conformity found by Weinmann et al. (2006): galaxies tend to
adopt the HI properties of their neighbours. We visually inspect the outliers
from the HI mass-size relation and galaxies which are offset from the HI plane
and find that they show morphological and kinematical signatures of recent
interactions with their environment. We speculate that these outliers have been
disturbed by tidal or ram-pressure stripping processes, or in a few cases, by
accretion events.

virial radius ($R_{\rm vir}$) consistent with predictions from gravity-only
cosmological simulations, in contrast to other cool-core clusters. To examine
the generality of these results, we present three new Suzaku observations that,
in conjunction with the North pointing, provide complete azimuthal coverage out
to $R_{\rm vir}$. With two new Chandra ACIS-I observations overlapping the
North Suzaku pointing, we have resolved $\gtrsim$50\% of the cosmic X-ray
background there. We present radial profiles of the ICM density, temperature,
entropy, and pressure obtained for each of the four directions. We measure only
modest azimuthal scatter in the ICM properties at $R_{\rm 200}$ between the
Suzaku pointings: 7.6\% in temperature and 8.6\% in density, while the
systematic errors can be significant. The temperature scatter, in particular,
is lower than that studied at $R_{\rm 200}$ for a small number of other
clusters observed with Suzaku. These azimuthal measurements verify that
RXJ1159+5531 is a regular, highly relaxed system. The well-behaved entropy
profiles we have measured for RXJ1159+5531 disfavor the weakening of the
accretion shock as an explanation of the entropy flattening found in other
cool-core clusters but is consistent with other explanations such as gas
clumping, electron-ion non-equilibrium, non-thermal pressure support, and
cosmic ray acceleration. Finally, we mention that the large-scale galaxy
density distribution of RXJ1159+5531 seems to have little impact on its gas

with a very short time between the ruptures of two necks connecting the middle
cluster of the ternary nuclear system and outer fragments. In particular, we
consider the case where the Coulomb field of the first massive fragment
separated during the first step of the fission produces a lower pre-scission
barrier in the second step of the residual part of the ternary system. In this
case, we obtain a probability of about $10^{-3}$ for the yield of massive
clusters such as \nuclide[70]{Ni}, \nuclide[80-82]{Ge}, \nuclide[86]{Se}, and
\nuclide[94]{Kr} in the ternary fission of \nuclide[252]{Cf}. These products
appear together with the clusters having mass numbers of $A = 132$--$140$. The
results show that the yield of a heavy cluster such as \nuclide[68-70]{Ni}
would be followed by a product of $A = 138$--$148$ with a large probability as
observed in the experimental data obtained with the FOBOS spectrometer at the
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The third product is not observed. The
landscape of the potential energy surface shows that the configuration of the
Ni + Ca + Sn decay channel is lower about 12 MeV than that of the Ca + Ni + Sn
channel. This leads to the fact, that the yield of Ni and Sn is large. The
analysis on the dependence of the velocity of the middle fragment on mass
numbers of the outer products leads to the conclusion that, in the collinear
tripartition channel of \nuclide[252]{Cf}, the middle cluster has a very small
velocity, which does not allow it to be found in experiments.

involves introduction of rigid edges which are edges that demand strict

of min-directed balanced cut with rigid edges (min-DBCRE). Our first algorithm
for min-DBCRE extends Agarwal et al.'s rounding procedure for digraph

being significantly smaller compared to the size of the complex, we obtain an
(a) $\tilde{O}(N)$ algorithm for computing homology groups $H_i(K,A)$ of a

planet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.
Therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fraction
of bona fide planets. Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall
Kepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. We present the
results from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the
Spitzer telescope during the the Kepler mission. These observations are
dedicated to estimating the false positive rate (FPR) amongst the Kepler
candidates. We select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges in
stellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transits
with Spitzer at 4.5 microns. We use these observations to measures the
candidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. A bandpass-dependent depth
alerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source
of the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. For most of the candidates
(85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths
measured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the
most discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that
dilute the photometry. The Spitzer constraints on their own yield FPRs between
5-40%, depending on the KOIs. By considering the population of the Kepler field
stars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, we
find that the overall FPR of our sample is low. The measured upper limit on the
FPR of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. This observational
result, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that is
not investigated by the Kepler observations, provides an independent indication
that Kepler's false positive rate is low.

of a putative ""mass gap"" between NSs ($m\leq3\ M_\odot$) and BHs ($m\geq 5\
M_\odot$). We find sources with the smaller mass component satisfying $m_2

NS, while systems with $m_2\gtrsim6\ M_\odot$ will be confirmed binary BHs.
Binary BHs with $m_2<5\ M_\odot$ (i.e., in the gap) cannot generically be

consistent with low-mass BH ($m<5\ M_\odot$), posing a challenge for
determining the maximum NS mass from LIGO/Virgo observations alone. Individual

of the proposed copula set, we provide the variance minimization problem of the

visit in 2000. The X-ray emitting nebula appeared more faint and patchy
compared with the first epoch. The flux decline was particularly evident in
fainter regions and the mean decline was 30-40 % in the 0.5-1.2 keV energy
band. A typical expansion of the brightest part of the remnant was 1.9 arcsec,
which corresponds to an expansion rate of 0.14 arcsec yr^{-1}. The soft X-ray
spectra extracted from both the 2000 and 2013 data can be explained by a
non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model convolved with interstellar
absorption, though do not allow us to constrain the origin of the flux
evolution. The plasma temperature has not significantly evolved since the 2000
epoch and we conclude that the fading of the X-ray emission is due largely to
expansion. This implies that recent expansion has been into a lower density
medium, a scenario that is qualitatively consistent with the structure of the
circumstellar environment photographed soon after the initial explosion more
than a century ago. Fainter areas are fading more quickly than brighter areas,
indicating that they are fainter because of a lower ambient medium density and
consequently more rapid expansion.

applications like wireless communications and image processing. This problem is
generally ill-posed since signal identifiability is a key concern, and there
have been efforts to use sparse models for regularizing blind deconvolution to
promote signal identifiability. Part I of this two-part paper establishes a
measure theoretically tight characterization of the ambiguity space for blind
deconvolution and unidentifiability of this inverse problem under unconstrained
inputs. Part II of this paper analyzes the identifiability of the
canonical-sparse blind deconvolution problem and establishes surprisingly
strong negative results on the sparsity-ambiguity trade-off scaling laws.
Specifically, the ill-posedness of canonical-sparse blind deconvolution is
quantified by exemplifying the dimension of the unidentifiable signal sets. An
important conclusion of the paper is that canonical sparsity occurring
naturally in applications is insufficient and that coding is necessary for
signal identifiability in blind deconvolution. The methods developed herein are
applied to a second-hop channel estimation problem to show that a family of
subspace coded signals (including repetition coding and geometrically decaying
signals) are unidentifiable under blind deconvolution.

coupling the splitting augmented Lagrangian and the conjugate gradient (CG).
Using the pre-estimated blur-kernel, we finally reconstruct the SR image by a
very simple non-blind SR method that uses a natural image prior. The proposed

there is always a ""bad"" local optimum such that the associated prediction error
is lower bounded by a constant multiple of $1/\sqrt{n}$. For convex
regularizers, this lower bound applies to all global optima. The theory is
applicable to many popular estimators, including convex $\ell_1$-based methods
as well as M-estimators based on nonconvex regularizers, including the SCAD
penalty or the MCP regularizer. In addition, for a broad class of nonconvex
regularizers, we show that the bad local optima are very common, in that a
broad class of local minimization algorithms with random initialization will
typically converge to a bad solution.

interpret the broad-band afterglow data of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). One
prediction of the models is that some afterglow temporal breaks at different
energy bands should be achromatic. Observations in the Swift era have revealed
chromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some GRBs, casting doubts on the EFS
origin of GRB afterglows. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to
address the question: how bad/good are the external forward shock models? Our
sample includes 85 GRBs well-monitored X-ray and optical lightcurves. Based on
how well the data abide by the EFS models, we categorize them as: Gold sample:
(Grade I and II) include 45/85 GRBs. They show evidence of, or are consistent
with having, an achromatic break. The temporal/spectral behaviors in each
afterglow segment are consistent with the predictions (closure relations) of
the EFS models. Silver sample: (Grade III and IV) include 37/85 GRBs. They are
also consistent with having an achromatic break, even though one or more
afterglow segments do not comply with the closure relations. Bad sample: (Grade
V), 3/85 shows direct evidence of chromatic behaviors, suggesting that the EFS
models are inconsistent with the data. These are included in the Bad sample. We
further perform statistical analyses of various observational properties
($\alpha$, $\beta$, $t_b$ and model parameters (energy injection index q, p,
$\theta_j$, $\eta_\gamma$, etc) of the GRBs in the Gold Sample, and derive
constraints on the magnetization parameter $\epsilon_B$ in the EFS. Overall, we
conclude that the simplest EFS models can account for the multi-wavelength
afterglow data of at least half of the GRBs. When more advanced modeling (e.g.,
long-lasting reverse shock, structured jets) is invoked, up to $>90 \%$ of the
afterglows may be interpreted within the framework of the ESF models.

which is a new class of gamma-ray emitting AGNs. Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(NLS1) have a small-mass black hole, but its mass accretion rate is almost as
high as Eddington limit. Therefore, by observing NLS1s, we can know the
evolution of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Some of NLS1s
are radio-loud and we call them RL-NLS1. From past observations,
multi-wavelength spectrum of RL-NLS1s is similar to that of typical blazars;
the synchrotron emission in the lower energy band up to the optical band, and
inverse Compton scattering of low energy photons from disk, torus, and broad
line region. X-ray band is a transittion region between the synchrotron and
inverse Compton, and also there is a possible disk/corona emission. Therefore,
we studied the energy-dependence of time variability of the X-ray emission of
1H0323+342, which have been observed by Suzaku in 2009 and 2013, in order to
constrain the emission mechanism. We found that the lower energy below 1 keV
and the higher energy above 7 keV show a different variability from the middle
energy band, indicating at least two emission components in the X-ray band.
X-ray spectrum is not a simple power-law, but requires an additional features;
a broken power-law plus flat hard component, or a power-law plus a relativistic
reflection component. Each spectral component seems to vary independently.

regulations for linear accelerators in Korean hospitals specify a system in
which each hospital stipulates its independent hospital-based protocols for QA

authorities verify whether items under these HP_QAPs have been performed.
However, because this regulatory method cannot guarantee the quality of
universal treatment, and QA items with tolerance criteria are different in many
hospitals, the presentation of standardized QA items and tolerance criteria is
essential. In this study, QA items in HP_QAPs from various hospitals and those
presented by international organizations. Concordance rates between QA items
for linear accelerators that were presented by the aforementioned organizations
and those currently being implemented in Korean hospitals were shown to exhibit
a daily QA of 50%, a weekly QA of 22%, a monthly QA of 43%, and an annual QA of

Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) of a random field, to solve the stochastic
elliptic diffusion PDE with the stochastic Galerkin discretization, and to
compute some quantities of interest (mean, variance, exceedance probabilities).
We assume that the random diffusion coefficient is given as a smooth
transformation of a Gaussian random field. In this case, the PCE is delivered
by a complicated formula, which lacks an analytic TT representation. To
construct its TT approximation numerically, we develop the new block TT cross
algorithm, a method that computes the whole TT decomposition from a few
evaluations of the PCE formula. The new method is conceptually similar to the
adaptive cross approximation in the TT format, but is more efficient when
several tensors must be stored in the same TT representation, which is the case
for the PCE. Besides, we demonstrate how to assemble the stochastic Galerkin
matrix and to compute the solution of the elliptic equation and its
post-processing, staying in the TT format.
  We compare our technique with the traditional sparse polynomial chaos and the
Monte Carlo approaches. In the tensor product polynomial chaos, the polynomial
degree is bounded for each random variable independently. This provides higher
accuracy than the sparse polynomial set or the Monte Carlo method, but the
cardinality of the tensor product set grows exponentially with the number of
random variables. However, when the PCE coefficients are implicitly
approximated in the TT format, the computations with the full tensor product
polynomial set become possible. In the numerical experiments, we confirm that
the new methodology is competitive in a wide range of parameters, especially
where high accuracy and high polynomial degrees are required.

achieve the extension of an existing specific derivation for GGC series in
univariate to multivariate. The derived multivariate GGC expression is more
elementary as using vector notations compare to the coordinatewise tensor

because it can help us to understand where the tumors are actually located and
have a precise treatment plan. However, there is a limitation that general CBCT
images cannot perfectly help the sophisticated registration. On the other hand,
SymmetryTM 4D IGRT system of Elekta can offer the 4D CBCT registration option.
In this study, we intend to evaluate the usefulness of SymmetryTM. Method and
Materials: Planning CT images of the CIRS moving lung phantom were acquired
from 4D MDCT. And they are sorted as 10 phases from 0% phase to 90% phase. The
thickness of CT images was 1 mm. Acquired MDCT images were transferred to the
contouring software and a virtual target was generated. An one arc VMAT plan
was performed by using the treatment planning system on the virtual target.
Finally, the movement of the phantom was verified through XVI SymmetryTM
system. Results: The physical movement of CIRS moving lung phantom was +/- 10.0
mm in superior-inferior direction, +/- 1.0 mm in lateral direction, and +/- 2.5
mm in anterior-posterior direction. The movement of the phantom was measured
from 4D MDCT registration as +/- 10.2 mm in superior-inferior direction, +/-
0.9 mm in lateral direction, and +/- 2.45 mm in anterior-posterior direction.
The movement of the phantom was measured from SymmetryTM registration as +/-

+/- 2.4 mm in anterior/posterior direction. Conclusion: It is confirmed that 4D
CBCT is a beneficial tool for the treatment of movable tumors. Therefore, 4D

arc (mARC) treatment techniques. The mARC treatment plans of the non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were performed in order to verify the clinical
usefulness of mARC. A pre study was conducted to find the most competent plan
condition of mARC treatment and the usefulness of mARC treatment plan was
evaluated by comparing it with the other Arc treatment plans such as
Tomotherapy and RapidArc. In the case of mARC, the optimal condition for the
mARC plan was determined by comparing the dosimetric performance of the mARC
plans with the use of various parameters. The various parameters includes the
photon energies (6 MV, 10 MV), optimization point angle (6{\deg}-10{\deg}
intervals), and total segment number (36-59 segment). The best dosimetric
performance of mARC was observed at 10 MV photon energy and the point angle 6
degree, and 59 segments. The each treatment plans of three different techniques
were compared with the following parameters: conformity index (CI), homogeneity
index (HI), target coverage, dose in the OARs, monitor units (MU), beam on time
and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). As a result, all three
different treatment techniques show the similar target coverage. The mARC
results the lowest V20 and MU per fraction compared with both RapidArc and
Tomotherapy plan. The mARC plan reduces the beam on time as well. Therefore,
the results of this study provided a satisfactory result which mARC technique
is considered as a useful clinical technique for radiation treatment.

by strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the chemical potential which make the
spin-momentum locking ill-defined over length scales of few nanometers or even

to control topological interfaces with atomic precision. Here, we demonstrate
that molecular self-assembly processes driven by inherent interactions among

if it is surrounded by an accretion disk. In these cases, the black hole is
distorted due to tidal forces. Nonetheless, the subsequent formulation of the
no-hair theorem holds: The contribution of the distorted black hole to the
multipole moments that describe the gravitational field close to infinity and,
thus, all sources is that of a Schwarzschild black hole. It still has no hair.
This implies that there is no multipole moment induced in the black hole and
that its second Love numbers, which measure some aspects of the distortion,

forming regions may explain the higher oxygen fugacities they record compared
to type I chondrules. Type I and type II chondrules formed in different

CyberKnife (CK) for spinal stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Ten
patients with spinal lesions who had been treated with CK were re-planned with
RA, which consisted of two complete arcs. Computed tomography (CT) and
volumetric dose data of CK, generated using the Multiplan (Accuray) treatment
planning system (TPS) and the Ray-Trace algorithm, were imported to Varian
Eclipse TPS in Dicom format, and the data were compared with the RA plan using
analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) dose calculation. The optimized dose
priorities for both CK and RA plans were similar for all patients. The highest
priority was to provide enough dose coverage to the planned target volume (PTV)
while limiting the maximum dose to the spinal cord. Plan quality was evaluated
with respect to PTV coverage, conformity index (CI), high-dose spillage,
intermediate-dose spillage (R50% and D2cm), and maximum dose to the spinal
cord, which are criteria recommended by RTOG 0631 spine and 0915 lung SBRT
protocols. The mean CI +/- SD values of PTV were 1.11 +/- 0.03 and 1.17 +/-
0.10 for RA and CK (p = 0.02), respectively. On average, the maximum dose
delivered to the spinal cord in CK plans was approximately 11.6% higher than in
RA plans, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
High-dose spillages were 0.86% and 2.26% for RA and CK (p = 0.203),
respectively. Intermediate-dose spillage characterized by D2cm was lower for RA
than for CK; however, R50% was not statistically different. Even though both
systems can create highly conformal volumetric dose distributions, the current
study shows that RA demonstrates lower high- and intermediate-dose spillage
than CK. Therefore, RA plans for spinal SBRT may be superior to CK.

state-of-the-art nuclear models, where several competing shape minima are found
close to the ground state. A classic region for investigating this phenomenon
is in the region around $Z=82$ and the neutron mid-shell at $N=104$.
  Purpose: Evidence for shape coexistence has been inferred from $\alpha$-decay
measurements, laser spectroscopy and in-beam measurements. While the latter
allow the pattern of excited states and rotational band structures to be mapped
out, a detailed understanding of shape coexistence can only come from
measurements of electromagnetic matrix elements.
  Method: Secondary, radioactive ion beams of $^{202}$Rn and $^{204}$Rn were
studied by means of low-energy Coulomb excitation at the REX-ISOLDE facility in
CERN.
  Results: The electric-quadrupole ($E2$) matrix element connecting the ground
state and first-excited $2^{+}_{1}$ state was extracted for both $^{202}$Rn and
$^{204}$Rn, corresponding to ${B(E2;2^{+}_{1} \to 2^{+}_{1})=29^{+8}_{-8}}$
W.u. and $43^{+17}_{-12}$ W.u., respectively. Additionally, $E2$ matrix
elements connecting the $2^{+}_{1}$ state with the $4^{+}_{1}$ and $2^{+}_{2}$
states were determined in $^{202}$Rn. No excited $0^{+}$ states were observed
in the current data set, possibly due to a limited population of second-order
processes at the currently-available beam energies.
  Conclusions: The results are discussed in terms of collectivity and the
deformation of both nuclei studied is deduced to be weak, as expected from the
low-lying level-energy schemes. Comparisons are also made to state-of-the-art
beyond-mean-field model calculations and the magnitude of the transitional
quadrupole moments are well reproduced.

are considered to study $CP$ violation with different nuclei as neutrino

$\varepsilon_{e\tau}$ of neutrinos with matter during propagation in longer

to some values of $\delta $ remain unobservable with present and near future
experimental facilities in superbeam and neutrino factory . However, in
presence of some ranges of off-diagonal NSI phase values there are some
possibilities of discovering total $CP$ violation for any $\delta_{CP}$ value

of NSI phases total $CP$ violation may not be at all observable for any values
of $\delta $. Using a neutrino beam from electron capture process for nuclei

between the initial and final Hamiltonians. We use the mean value of a single
operator to measure the distance between the final state and the ideal ground

prove under certain conditions, this error can be precisely estimated for an
arbitrarily given interpolating function. This error estimation could be used
as guideline to induce adiabatic evolution. According to our calculation, the
adiabatic approximation error is not proportional to the average speed of the
variation of the system Hamiltonian and the inverse of the energy gaps in many
cases. In particular, we apply this analysis to an example on which the
applicability of the adiabatic theorem is questionable.

to be mounted to LGKP. As an active material concentrically located in the
hemispheric head phantom, we choose Gafchromic EBT3 films and Gd2O2S;Tb
phosphor sheets for dosimetric measurements. Also, to compensate the lack of
backscatter, we located a 1 cm thick PMMA plate downstream of the active layer.
The PMMA plate was transparent for scintillation lights to reach the CCD with
1200x1200 pixels by a 5.2 um pitch. Using this system, three hundred images by
a 0.2 mm slice gap were acquired under each of three collimator setups, i.e. 4
mm, 8 mm, and 16 mm, respectively. The 2D projected images taken by CCD camera
were compared with the dose distributions measured by EBT3 films in the same
conditions. All 2D distributions were normalized by the maximum values derived
by fitting peaks for each collimator setup. The FWHM differences of 2D profiles
between of CCD images and of film doses were measured to be less than 0.3 mm.
The scanning task for whole peak regions took less than three minutes with the
new instrument. It could be utilized as a QA tool for the Gamma Knife
radiosurgery system instead of film dosimetry, the use of which requires much
more time and resources.

trihalide perovskites, which are at the heart of the new generation of
solid-state solar cells. Here, we calculated the static conductivity of charged
domain walls in n- and p- doped organometallic uniaxial ferroelectric
semiconductor perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD)
theory. We find that due to the charge carrier accumulation, the static
conductivity may drastically increase at the domain wall by 3-4 orders of
magnitude in comparison with conductivity through the bulk of the material.
Also, a two-dimensional degenerated gas of highly mobile charge carriers could
be formed at the wall. The high values of conductivity at domain walls and
interfaces explain high efficiency in organometallic solution-processed
perovskite films which contains lots of different point and extended defects.
These results could suggest new routes to enhance the performance of this
promising class of novel photovoltaic materials.

colloids) immersed in a solvent exhibiting two-phase separation. Using a
non-local density functional theory, we determine the dependence of the
effective potential on the separation of the nanoparticles when the solvent is
near bulk two-phase coexistence. If identical nanoparticles preferentially
adsorbing phase $\alpha$ are inserted into phase $\beta$, thick wetting layers
of the preferable phase $\alpha$ develop at their surfaces. At some particular
separation $h_b$ of the nanoparticles, the wetting layers connect to form a
single bridge, and the induced effective potential becomes strongly attractive
for all distances $h<h_b$. The bridging is a first order capillary condensation
like transition for all radii of the nanoparticles greater than the critical
radius $R_c$, the value of which was estimated to be approximately
$R_c\approx20\sigma$ for a temperature $T/T_c\approx0.9$, where $\sigma$ is the
size of the solvent (square-well) particles. For radii $R<R_c$ the process of
bridging is continuous. If the same particles are inserted into the preferable
phase $\alpha$, the only effective interaction between them is induced by the
short-ranged depletion potential. If the nanoparticles have opposite adsorption
preferences, only a single wetting layer forms around one of the nanoparticles
and the effective interaction is strongly repulsive in both phases. The
repulsion, induced by a disruption of the wetting film by the presence of the
second particle, is larger and slightly longer-ranged in a low density state.

strongly to high-frequency changes in data which can be used for the smoothing

the spatial computation of B-spline curves (approximating splines) in 2D

can be represented and the degree of spline curvature corresponds to the
relaxation time of the material. The material computation of spline curves also
includes novel quasi-mechanical properties including unwind- ing of the shape

Interpolating splines could not directly be ap- proximated due to the formation

after rectilinear pre-processing of the source data. This pre-processing was
further simplified by transform- ing the original data to contain the material

semiclassical picture based on the local constant-crossed field approximation

substructure of the spectrum, which results from interference effects between
macroscopically separated formation regions. In order to compare the

Adsorbed atoms (adatoms), which are represented by a continuous density,
diffuse on terraces, and steps move by absorbing or emitting these adatoms.
Here we shed light on the microscopic origins of the BCF theory by deriving a

restricted solid-on- solid (KRSOS) model without external material deposition.
We define the time-dependent adatom density and step position as appropriate
ensemble averages in the KRSOS model, thereby exposing the non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics origins of the BCF theory. Our analysis reveals that the
BCF theory is valid in a low adatom-density regime, much in the same way that
an ideal gas approximation applies to dilute gasses. We find conditions under
which the surface remains in a low-density regime and discuss the microscopic
origin of corrections to the BCF model.

non-singular projective curve defined over an arbitrary (perfect) field $k$.
The method is based on a correspondence between twists and solutions to a
Galois embedding problem. When in addition, this curve is non-hyperelliptic we
show how to compute equations for the twists. If $k = \mathbb{F}_{q}$ the
method then becomes an algorithm, since in this case, the Galois embedding
problems that appear are known how to be solved. As an example we compute the
set of twists of the non-hyperelliptic genus $6$ curve $x^{7}-y^{3}z^{4}-z^{7}

$[k(\zeta_{21}):k] = 12$. For each twist equations are exhibited.

bichromatic ($2$-colored) cycles. The acyclic chromatic index of a graph $G$,
denoted by $a'(G)$, is the least integer $k$ such that $G$ admits an acyclic
edge-coloring using $k$ colors. Let $\Delta = \Delta(G)$ denote the maximum
degree of a vertex in a graph $G$. A complete bipartite graph with $n$ vertices
on each side is denoted by $K_{n,n}$. Basavaraju, Chandran and Kummini proved
that $a'(K_{n,n}) \ge n+2 = \Delta + 2$ when $n$ is odd. Basavaraju and
Chandran provided an acyclic edge-coloring of $K_{p,p}$ using $p+2$ colors and
thus establishing $a'(K_{p,p}) = p+2 = \Delta + 2$ when $p$ is an odd prime.
The main tool in their approach is perfect $1$-factorization of $K_{p,p}$.
Recently, following their approach, Venkateswarlu and Sarkar have shown that
$K_{2p-1,2p-1}$ admits an acyclic edge-coloring using $2p+1$ colors which
implies that $a'(K_{2p-1,2p-1}) = 2p+1 = \Delta + 2$, where $p$ is an odd
prime. In this paper, we generalize this approach and present a general
framework to possibly get an acyclic edge-coloring of $K_{n,n}$ which possess a
perfect $1$-factorization using $n+2 = \Delta+2$ colors. In this general
framework, we show that $K_{p^2,p^2}$ admits an acyclic edge-coloring using
$p^2+2$ colors and thus establishing $a'(K_{p^2,p^2}) = p^2+2 = \Delta + 2$

skeletons based systems from different angles. First, we present a model we
conceived that allows algorithmic skeletons customization exploiting the macro

new map-making algorithms that can create polarisation maps that are clean of

pointing between a detector pair. Where a half wave plate is used, we show that
the spin-2 systematic due to differential ellipticity can also by removed using
our algorithms. The algorithms require no prior knowledge of the imperfections

the systematic and polarisation maps in one step directly from the time ordered
data (TOD). The first algorithm is designed to work with scan strategies that
have a good range of crossing angles for each map pixel and the second for scan
strategies that have a limited range of crossing angles. The first algorithm
can also be used to identify if systematic errors that have a particular spin
are present in a TOD. We demonstrate the use of both algorithms and the ability
to identify systematics with simulations of TOD with realistic scan strategies

Boshernitzan, is to give criteria for a bounded complex-valued sequence to be
uncorrelated to any strictly ergodic sequence. As a tool developed to study
this problem we introduce the notion of correlation between two shift-invariant
measures supported by the symbolic space with complex symbols. We also prove a
""lifting lemma"" for generic points: given a joining $\xi$ of two
shift-invariant measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, every point $x$ generic for $\mu$
lifts to a pair $(x,y)$ generic for $\xi$ (such $y$ exists in the full symbolic
space). This lemma allows us to translate correlation between bounded sequences
to the language of correlation of measures. Finally, to establish that the
property of an invariant measure being uncorrelated to any ergodic measure is
essentially weaker than the property of being disjoint from any ergodic
measure, we develop and apply criteria for ergodicity of four-jump cocycles
over irrational rotations. We believe that apart from the applications to
studying the notion of correlation, the two developed tools: the lifting lemma
and the criteria for ergodicity of four-jump cocycles, are of independent
interest. This is why we announce them also in the title. In the Appendix we
also introduce the notion of conditional disjointness.

lattice-based cryptosystems whose security is based on the hardness of lattice

drawbacks such as; large public key length and low security level. On the other
hand, Low Density Lattice Codes (LDLCs) are the practical classes of lattice

key cryptosystem based on LDLCs to withdraw the drawbacks of GGH cryptosystem.
To reduce the key length, we employ the generator matrix of the used LDLC in
Hermite normal form (HNF) as the public key. Also, by exploiting the linear
decoding complexity of the used LDLC, the decryption complexity is decreased
compared with GGH cryptosystem. These increased efficiencies allow us to use
the bigger values of security parameters. Moreover, we exploit the special
Gaussian vector whose variance is upper bounded by the Poltyrev limit as the
perturbation vector. These techniques can resist the proposed scheme against
the most efficient attacks to the GGH-like cryptosystems.

density distribution of crystals under the constraints of observed diffraction
data. Nevertheless, the reconstruction of electron density distribution by
straightforward Fourier synthesis is usually hindered due to the well-known
phase problem and finite resolution of diffraction data. In analogy with
optical imaging system, the reconstructed electron density map may be regarded
as the image of the real electron density distribution in crystals. Inspired by
image definition evaluation functions applied in auto-focusing process, we
proposed two evaluation functions for the reconstructed electron density
images. One of them is based on atomicity of electron density distribution and
properties of Fourier synthesis. Tests were performed on synthetic data of
known structures, and it was found that this evaluation function can
distinguish the correctly reconstructed electron density image from wrong ones
when diffraction data of atomic resolution is available. An algorithm was
established based on this evaluation function and applied in reconstructing the
electron density image from synthetic data of known structures. The other
evaluation function, which is based on the positivity of electron density and
constrained entropy maximization, was designed for cases where only diffraction
data of rather limited resolution is available. Tests on synthetic data
indicate that this evaluation function may identify the correct phase set even
for a dataset at the resolution as low as 3.5 {\AA}. Though no algorithm of
structure solution has been figured out based on the latter function, the
results presented here provide a new perspective on the phase problem.

scores that the examinee obtains in a test, is also error-ridden. The
quantification of such error or uncertainty in the test score data--or rather
the complementary test reliability--is pursued within the paradigm of Classical
Test Theory in a variety of ways, with no existing method of finding
reliability, isomorphic to the theoretical definition that parametrises
reliability as the ratio of the true score variance and observed (i.e.
error-ridden) score variance. Thus, multiple reliability coefficients for the
same test have been advanced. This paper describes a much needed method of
obtaining reliability of a test as per its theoretical definition, via a single
administration of the test, by using a new fast method of splitting of a given
test into parallel halves, achieving near-coincident empirical distributions of
the two halves. The method has the desirable property of achieving splitting on
the basis of difficulty of the questions (or items) that constitute the test,
thus allowing for fast computation of reliability even for very large test data
sets, i.e. test data obtained by a very large examinee sample. An interval
estimate for the true score is offered, given an examinee score, subsequent to
the determination of the test reliability. This method of finding test
reliability as per the classical definition can be extended to find reliability
of a set or battery of tests; a method for determination of the weights
implemented in the computation of the weighted battery score is discussed. We
perform empirical illustration of our method on real and simulated tests, and
on a real test battery comprising two constituent tests.

level, limited by timing noise. Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of
pulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars
and has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of
timing noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise
spectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the
hunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by
calculating minimum observation times, $T_{\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the
gravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau. We do
this in two ways: 1) in a model-independent manner, and 2) by using the
superfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how
neutron star parameters can be constrained. We show that the superfluid
turbulence model can reproduce the data qualitatively from a number of pulsars
observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We further show how a value
of $f_c$, derived either through observations or theory, can be related to
$T_{\rm min}$. This provides a diagnostic whereby the usefulness of timing
array pulsars for gravitational-wave detection can be quantified.

are used to estimate the space-time dynamics of the burning of the D-T fuel in
Laser driven pellet fusion experiments. The initial ""High foot"" heating of the
fuel makes the compressed target transparent to radiation, and then a rapid
ignition pulse can penetrate and heat up the whole target to supercritical
temperatures in a short time, so that most of the interior of the target
ignites almost simultaneously and instabilities will have no time to develop.
In these relativistic, radiation dominated processes both the interior,
time-like burning front and the surrounding space-like part of the front will
be stable against Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. To achieve this rapid, volume
ignition the pulse heating up the target to supercritical temperature should
provide the required energy in less than ~ 10 ps.

behaviour of a Haldane spin-chain compound containing light rare-earth ion,
Nd2BaNiO5, in detail, as a function of temperature (T) and magnetic field (H)
down to 2 K. In addition to the well-known long range antiferromagnetic order
setting in at (T_N=) 48 K as indicated in dc magnetization (M), we have
observed another magnetic transition near 10 K; this transition appears to be
of a glassy-type which vanishes with a marginal application of external
magnetic field (even H= 100 Oe). There are corresponding anomalies in
dielectric constant as well with variation of T. The isothermal M(H) curves at
2 and 5 K reveal the existence of a magnetic-field induced transition around 90
kOe; the isothermal H-dependent dielectric constant also tracks such a
metamagnetic transition. These results illustrate the MDE coupling in this
compound. Additionally, we observe a strong frequency dependence of a step in
T-dependent dielectric constant with this feature appearing around 25-30 K for
the lowest frequency of 1 kHz, far below T_N. This is attributed to interplay
between crystal-field effect and exchange interaction between Nd and Ni, which
establishes the sensitivity of dielectric measurements to detect such effects.
Interestingly enough, the observed dispersions of the T-dependent dielectric
constant curves is essentially H-independent in the entire T-range of
measurement, despite the existence of MDE coupling, which is in sharp contrast
with other heavy rare-earth members in this series.

modulation (GSM) in indoor wireless visible light communication (VLC) systems.
GSM uses $N_t$ light emitting diodes (LED), but activates only $N_a$ of them at
a given time. Spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing are special cases of
GSM with $N_{a}=1$ and $N_{a}=N_t$, respectively. We first derive an analytical
upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) for maximum likelihood (ML) detection
of GSM in VLC systems. Analysis and simulation results show that the derived
upper bound is very tight at medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The
channel gains and channel correlations influence the GSM performance such that
the best BER is achieved at an optimum LED spacing. Also, for a fixed
transmission efficiency, the performance of GSM in VLC improves as the
half-power semi-angle of the LEDs is decreased. We then compare the performance
of GSM in VLC systems with those of other MIMO schemes such as spatial
multiplexing (SMP), space shift keying (SSK), generalized space shift keying
(GSSK), and spatial modulation (SM). Analysis and simulation results show that
GSM in VLC outperforms the other considered MIMO schemes at moderate to high
SNRs; for example, for 8 bits per channel use, GSM outperforms SMP and GSSK by
about 21 dB, and SM by about 10 dB at $10^{-4}$ BER.

Parameterizing the light curve shape through rise and decline timescales shows
that the two are highly correlated. Magnetar-powered models can reproduce the
correlation, with the diversity in rise and decline rates driven by the
diffusion timescale. Circumstellar interaction models can exhibit a similar
rise-decline relation, but only for a narrow range of densities, which may be
problematic for these models. We find that SLSNe are approximately 3.5
magnitudes brighter and have light curves 3 times broader than SNe Ibc, but
that the intrinsic shapes are similar. There are a number of SLSNe with
particularly broad light curves, possibly indicating two progenitor channels,
but statistical tests do not cleanly separate two populations. The general
spectral evolution is also presented. Velocities measured from Fe II are
similar for SLSNe and SNe Ibc, suggesting that diffusion time differences are
dominated by mass or opacity. Flat velocity evolution in most SLSNe suggests a
dense shell of ejecta. If opacities in SLSNe are similar to other SNe Ibc, the
average ejected mass is higher by a factor 2-3. Assuming
$\kappa=0.1\,$cm$^2\,$g$^{-1}$, we estimate a mean (median) SLSN ejecta mass of
10$\,$M$_\odot$ (6$\,$M$_\odot$), with a range of 3-30$\,$M$_\odot$. Doubling
the assumed opacity brings the masses closer to normal SNe Ibc, but with a
high-mass tail. The most probable mechanism for generating SLSNe seems to be
the core-collapse of a very massive hydrogen-poor star, forming a millisecond
magnetar.

quasi-periodic solutions in a quasi-periodic Frenkel-Kontorova model when the

  The KAM theory we develop is very different both in the methods and in the
conclusions from the more customary KAM theory for Hamiltonian systems or from
the KAM theory in quasi-periodic media for solutions with frequencies which are
Diophantine with respect to the frequencies of the media. The main difficulty
is that we cannot use transformations (as in the Hamiltonian case) nor Ward
identities (as in the case of frequencies Diophantine with those of the media).
  The technique we use is to add an extra equation that ensures the
linearization of the equilibrium equation factorizes. To solve the extra
equation requires an extra counterterm. We compare this phenomenon with other
phenomena in KAM theory. It seems that this technique could be used in several
other problems.
  As a conclusion, we obtain that the perturbation expansions developed in the
previous paper \cite{SuZL15} converge when the potentials are in a codimension
one manifold in a space of potentials. The method of proof also leads to
efficient (low storage requirements and low operation count) algorithms to

chameleon mechanism and reveal the presence of the scalar field with properly
designed experiments. In the third part, I will describe a recent experiment
performed with a neutron interferometer at the Institut Laue Langevin that sets
already interesting constraints on the chameleon theory. Last, the chameleon
field can be probed by measuring the quantum states of neutrons bouncing over a

planning. We propose a neural mechanism to non-destructively translate the
current state of memory into the future, so as to construct an ordered set of
future predictions. This framework applies equally well to translations in time
or in one-dimensional position. In a two-layer memory network that encodes the
Laplace transform of the external input in real time, translation can be
accomplished by modulating the weights between the layers. We propose that
within each cycle of hippocampal theta oscillations, the memory state is swept
through a range of translations to yield an ordered set of future predictions.
We operationalize several neurobiological findings into phenomenological
equations constraining translation. Combined with constraints based on physical
principles requiring scale-invariance and coherence in translation across
memory nodes, the proposition results in Weber-Fechner spacing for the
representation of both past (memory) and future (prediction) timelines. The
resulting expressions are consistent with findings from phase precession
experiments in different regions of the hippocampus and reward systems in the
ventral striatum. The model makes several experimental predictions that can be
tested with existing technology.

stationary phase approximation and a phenomenological model based on the
properties of the complex poles and zeroes of the reflection coefficient are
used to demonstrate that: i) the excitation of backward surface waves can lead
to both negative and positive (and not exclusively negative) Goos-H\""anchen

one-dimensional model for water flux and water uptake by a root system growing
uniformly distributed in the soil is presented, and the Van Genuchten model for
the transport of water in soil is used. The governing equations are represented
by a moving boundary model for which the root length, as a function of time, is
prescribed. The solution of the model is obtained by front-fixing and finite
element methods. Model predictions for water uptake by a same plant growing in
loam, silt and clay soils are obtained and compared. A sensitivity analysis to
determine relative effects on water uptake when system parameters are changed
is also presented and shows that the model and numerical method proposed are
more sensitive to the root growth rate than to the rest of the parameters. This
sensitivity decreases along time, reaching its maximum at thirty days. A
comparison of this model with a fixed boundary model with and without root
growth is also made. The results show qualitative differences from the

is known that their eigenvalue distribution is intermediate between

system intermediate between the extended and localized phase. We show that they
have a much richer energy landscape than expected, with their partition
functions decomposable in a large number of equilibrium configurations, growing
exponentially with the matrix rank. Within each of these saddle points,
eigenvalues are uncorrelated and confined by a different potential felt by each
eigenvalue. The equilibrium positions induced by the potentials differ in
different saddles. Instantons connecting the different equilibrium
configurations are responsible for the correlations between the eigenvalues. We
argue that these instantons can be linked to the SU(2) components in which the

one of the most remarkable implications of collective quantum coherence. In
equilibrium systems like liquid 4He and ultracold atomic gases, superfluid
behaviour conjugates diverse yet related phenomena, such as persistency of
metastable flow in multiply connected geometries and the existence of a
critical velocity for frictionless flow when hitting a static defect. The link
between these different aspects of superfluid behaviour is far less clear in
driven-dissipative systems displaying collective coherence, such as microcavity
polaritons, which raises important questions about their concurrency. With a
joint theoretical and experimental study, we show that the scenario is
particularly rich for polaritons driven in a three-fluid collective coherent
regime so-called optical parametric oscillator. On the one hand, the
spontaneous macroscopic coherence following the phase locking of the signal and
idler fluids has been shown to be responsible for their simultaneous quantized
flow metastability. On the other hand, we show here that pump, signal and idler
have distinct responses when hitting a static defect; while the signal displays
hardly appreciable modulations, the ones appearing in pump and idler are
determined by their mutual coupling due to nonlinear and parametric processes.

quasispecies model. This fitness landscape can be considered as a direct
generalization of the so-called single or sharply peaked landscape. A general,
non permutation invariant quasispecies model is studied, therefore the
dimension of the problem is $2^N\times 2^N$, where $N$ is the sequence length.
It is shown that if the fitness function is equal to $w+s$ on a $G$-orbit $A$
and is equal to $w$ elsewhere, then the mean population fitness can be found as
the largest root of an algebraic equation of degree at most $N+1$. Here $G$ is
an arbitrary isometry group acting on the metric space of sequences of zeroes
and ones of the length $N$ with the Hamming distance. An explicit form of this
exact algebraic equation is given in terms of the spherical growth function of
the $G$-orbit $A$. Sufficient conditions for the so-called error threshold for
sequences of orbits are given. Motivated by the analysis of the two-valued
fitness landscapes an abstract generalization of Eigen's model is introduced
such that the sequences are identified with the points of a finite metric space
$X$ together with a group of isometries acting transitively on $X$. In
particular, a simplicial analogue of the original quasispecies model is
discussed, which can be considered as a mathematical model of the switching of
the antigenic variants for some bacteria.

been extensively studied. Most of existing samplers require $q\ge \alpha
\Delta+\beta$ for some constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of the graph. The problem becomes more challenging when the
underlying graph has unbounded degree since even the decision of
$q$-colorability becomes nontrivial in this situation. The Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,d/n)$ is a typical class of such graphs and has
received a lot of recent attention. In this case, the performance of a sampler
is usually measured by the relation between $q$ and the average degree $d$. We

the state-of-the-art with such sampler for proper $q$-coloring on

bound for the problem so far. Our sampler is based on the spatial mixing
property of $q$-coloring on random graphs. The core of the sampler is a
deterministic algorithm to estimate the marginal probability on blocks, which
is computed by a novel block version of recursion for $q$-coloring on unbounded

  Methods. We coupled a dynamical and thermodynamical disk model with a
temperature-dependent opacity table (that accounts for the sublimation of the
main dust components) to investigate the formation and evolution of snowlines
and planet traps during the first million years of disk evolution.
  Results. Starting from a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), we find that the
disk mid-plane temperature profile shows several plateaux (0.1-1 AU wide) at
the different sublimation temperatures of the species that make up the dust.
For water ice, the correspond- ing plateau can be larger than 1 AU, which means
that this is a snow ""region"" rather than a snow ""line"". As a consequence, the
surface density of solids in the snow region may increase gradually, not
abruptly. Several planet traps and desert regions appear naturally as a result
of abrupt local changes in the temperature and density profiles over the disk
lifetime. These structures are mostly located at the edges of the temperature
plateaux (surrounding the dust sublimation lines) and at the heat-transition
barrier where the disk stellar heating and viscous heating are of the same
magnitude (around 10 AU after 1 Myr).
  Conclusions. Several traps are identified: although a few appear to be
transient, most of them slowly migrate along with the heat- transition barrier
or the dust sublimation lines. These planet traps may temporarily favor the
growth of planetary cores.

networks in order to cater to increasing user demands. In this context, cloud
based radio access networks have garnered significant interest as a cost
effective solution to the problem of coping with denser networks and providing
higher data rates. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, a
quantitative analysis of the cost of such networks is yet to be undertaken.
This paper develops a theoretic framework that enables computation of the
deployment cost of a network (modeled using various spatial point processes) to
answer the question posed by the paper's title. Then, the framework obtained is
used along with a complexity model, which enables computing the information
processing costs of a network, to compare the deployment cost of a cloud based
network against that of a traditional LTE network, and to analyze why they are
more economical. Using this framework and an exemplary budget, this paper shows
that cloud-based radio access networks require approximately 10 to 15% less
capital expenditure per square kilometer than traditional LTE networks. It also
demonstrates that the cost savings depend largely on the costs of base stations
and the mix of backhaul technologies used to connect base stations with data
centers.

the 100MeV (LAT) emission is radiation from cooled electrons accelerated by
external shocks, we show that the kinetic energy of the blast wave estimated
from the 100MeV flux is 50 times larger than the one estimated from the X-ray
flux. This can be explained if either: i) electrons radiating at X-rays are
significantly cooled by SSC (suppressing the synchrotron flux above the cooling
frequency) or ii) if the X-ray emitting electrons, unlike those emitting at
100MeV energies, are in the slow cooling regime. In both cases the X-ray flux
is no longer an immediate proxy of the blast wave kinetic energy. We model the
LAT, X-ray and optical data and show that in general these possibilities are
consistent with the data, and explain the apparent disagreement between X-ray
and LAT observations. All possible solutions require weak magnetic fields:
$10^{-6}< \epsilon_B < 10^{-3}$ (where $\epsilon_B$ is the fraction of shocked
plasma energy in magnetic fields). Using the LAT emission as a proxy for the
blast wave kinetic energy we find that the derived prompt efficiencies are of

higher for the same bursts). This provides at least a partial solution to the

taken by MMT 6.5m telescope. We find that the archival light curves from the
original image subtraction procedure exhibit many unusual outliers, and more
than 20% of data get rejected by the simple filtering algorithm adopted by
early analysis. In order to achieve better photometric precisions and also to
utilize all available data, the entire imaging database was re-analyzed with
our time-series photometry technique (Multi-aperture Indexing Photometry) and a
set of sophisticated calibration procedures. The merit of this approach is as
follows: we find an optimal aperture for each star with a maximum
signal-to-noise ratio, and also treat peculiar situations where photometry
returns misleading information with more optimal photometric index. We also
adopt photometric de-trending based on a hierarchical clustering method, which
is a very useful tool in removing systematics from light curves. Our method
removes systematic variations that are shared by light curves of nearby stars,
while true variabilities are preserved. Consequently, our method utilizes
nearly 100% of available data and reduce the rms scatter several times smaller
than archival light curves for brighter stars. This new data set gives a rare
opportunity to explore different types of variability of short (~minutes) and
long (~1 month) time scales in open cluster stars.

cases, a combination of DOM analysis with screenshot capture and image

produces false alarms because different DOMs may lead to identical or

cross-browser testing based purely on image processing. The method relies on
image segmentation to extract regions from a Web page and computer vision
techniques to extract a set of characteristic features from each region.
Regions extracted from a screenshot taken on a baseline browser are compared
against regions extracted from the browser under test based on characteristic
features. A machine learning classifier is used to determine if differences
between two matched regions should be classified as an incompatibility. An

encountered difficulties. There is no consensus as to even the shape of

liquid-gas interface, we identify different schemes for separating microscopic
observables into background and interfacial contributions. In order for the
backgrounds of the density-density correlation function and local structure
factor to have a consistent and physically meaningful interpretation in terms
of weighted bulk gas and liquid contributions, the background of the total
structure factor must be characterised by a microscopic $q$-dependent length
$\zeta(q)$ not identified previously. The necessity of including the $q$
dependence of $\zeta(q)$ is illustrated explicitly in our model and has wider
implications, i.e. in typical experimental and simulation studies, an
indeterminacy in $\zeta(q)$ will always be present, reminiscent of the cut-off
used in capillary-wave theory. This leads inevitably to a large uncertainty in
the $q$ dependence of $\sigma_\text{eff}(q)$.

equilibria under uncertainty. The underlying game is a multicast game in a
rooted undirected graph with nonnegative edge costs. A set of k terminal
vertices or players need to establish connectivity with the root. The social
optimum is the Minimum Steiner Tree. We are interested in situations where the
designer has incomplete information about the input. We propose two different
models, the adversarial and the stochastic. In both models, the designer has
prior knowledge of the underlying metric but the requested subset of the
players is not known and is activated either in an adversarial manner
(adversarial model) or is drawn from a known probability distribution
(stochastic model).
  In the adversarial model, the designer's goal is to choose a single,
universal protocol that has low Price of Anarchy (PoA) for all possible
requested subsets of players. The main question we address is: to what extent
can prior knowledge of the underlying metric help in the design? We first
demonstrate that there exist graphs (outerplanar) where knowledge of the
underlying metric can dramatically improve the performance of good network
design. Then, in our main technical result, we show that there exist graph
metrics, for which knowing the underlying metric does not help and any
universal protocol has PoA of $\Omega(\log k)$, which is tight. We attack this
problem by developing new techniques that employ powerful tools from extremal
combinatorics, and more specifically Ramsey Theory in high dimensional
hypercubes.
  Then we switch to the stochastic model, where each player is independently
activated. We show that there exists a randomized ordered protocol that
achieves constant PoA. By using standard derandomization techniques, we produce
a deterministic ordered protocol with constant PoA.

zero when the temperature vanishes, i.e., the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied.
For ferromagnetic metals with perfect crystal lattices described by the Drude
model the Casimir entropy goes to a nonzero constant depending on the
parameters of a system with vanishing temperature, i.e., the Nernst heat
theorem is violated. This constant can be positive which is quite different
from the earlier investigated case of two nonmagnetic metals.

The
placement strategies adopted by Weiqi players are often used to analog the
philosophy of human wars. Contrary to the western chess, Weiqi games are less
studied by academics partially because Weiqi is popular only in East Asia,
especially in China, Japan and Korea. Here, we propose to construct a directed
tree using a database of extensive Weiqi games and perform a quantitative
analysis of the Weiqi tree. We find that the popularity distribution of Weiqi
openings with a same number of moves is distributed according to a power law
and the tail exponent increases with the number of moves. Intriguingly, the
superposition of the popularity distributions of Weiqi openings with the number
of moves no more than a given number also has a power-law tail in which the
tail exponent increases with the number of moves, and the superposed
distribution approaches to the Zipf law. These findings are the same as for
chess and support the conjecture that the popularity distribution of board game
openings follows the Zipf law with a universal exponent. We also find that the
distribution of out-degrees has a power-law form, the distribution of branching
ratios has a very complicated pattern, and the distribution of uniqueness
scores defined by the path lengths from the root vertex to the leaf vertices
exhibits a unimodal shape. Our work provides a promising direction for the
study of the decision making process of Weiqi playing from the angle of
directed branching tree.

of many real networks follows either the global principle of popularity or the
local principle of similarity or a tradeoff between the two. In particular, it
has been shown that in social networks individuals exhibit significant
homophily when choosing their collaborators. We demonstrate, however, that in
populations in which there is a division of labor, skill complementarity is an
important factor in the formation of socioeconomic networks and an individual's
choice of collaborators is strongly affected by heterophily. We analyze 124
evolving virtual worlds of a popular ""massively multiplayer online role-playing
game"" (MMORPG) in which people belong to three different professions and are
allowed to work and interact with each other in a somewhat realistic manner. We
find evidence of heterophily in the formation of collaboration networks, where
people prefer to forge social ties with people who have professions different
from their own. We then construct an economic model to quantify the heterophily
by assuming that individuals in socioeconomic systems choose collaborators that
are of maximum utility. The results of model calibration confirm the presence
of heterophily. Both empirical analysis and model calibration show that the
heterophilous feature is persistent along the evolution of virtual worlds. We
also find that the degree of complementarity in virtual societies is positively
correlated with their economic output. Our work sheds new light on the
scientific research utility of virtual worlds for studying human behaviors in
complex socioeconomic systems.
