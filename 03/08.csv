from number fields. Conversely, we show that the fundamental group often pins
down the number field uniquely. We relate the first homology to some
interesting ideal. OT manifolds are never K\""ahler, but carry an LCK metric
(locally conformally K\""ahler). Oeljeklaus and Toma used them to disprove a
conjecture on the Betti numbers of spaces carrying LCK metrics. Mysteriously,
the volume for this metric gives the discriminant and Dirichlet regulator of
the number field. Totally unlike the above topological aspects, there does not
seem to be a conceptual reason why this should be expected. Is it a
coincidence? We explore this and see what happens if we (entirely
experimentally!) regard them as ""baby siblings"" of, say, hyperbolic manifolds
coming from number fields. We ask the same questions and obtain similar
answers, but ultimately it remains unclear whether we are chasing ghosts or
not.

combinatorial purpose. This number (of subatoms) can be an infinite cardinal.
The idea originates with Leon Henkin. Splitting methods existing in a scattered

regarding the optimal dependency of the regret achievable for online local
learning on the size of the label set. In this framework the algorithm is shown
a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then
predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a
real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting
scenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut
among others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning
algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$
is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of
$O(\sqrt{n \log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework
concerns closing the above gap.
  In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main
results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming
based algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a), in fact achieves a regret of
$O(\sqrt{nLT})$. Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely,
we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower
regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem
which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a
related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike
planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known
quasi-polynomial time algorithms.
  Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we
hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other
online learning scenarios as well.

water and a body freely floating in it. Water occupies either a half-space or a
layer of constant depth into which an infinitely long surface-piercing cylinder
is immersed, thus allowing us to study two-dimensional modes. Under the
assumption that the motion is of small amplitude near equilibrium, a linear
setting is applicable and for the time-harmonic oscillations it reduces to a
spectral problem with the frequency of oscillations as the spectral parameter.
It is essential that one of the problem's relations is linear with respect to
the parameter, whereas two others are quadratic with respect to it.
  Within this framework, it is shown that the total energy of the water motion
is finite and the equipartition of energy holds for the whole system. On this
basis, it is proved that no wave modes can be trapped provided their
frequencies exceed a bound depending on cylinder's properties, whereas its
geometry is subject to some restrictions and, in some cases, certain
restrictions are imposed on the type of mode.

""nonstatistical"" $\langle p_t \rangle$ fluctuations decreases with increasing
particle multiplicity $n_{ch}$ (or A-A centrality) and is nearly independent of
collision energy over a large interval. Among several potential mechanisms for
those trends onset of thermalization and collectivity are mentioned. The LHC
analysis employed one fluctuation measure selected from several possibilities.
An alternative fluctuation measure reveals strong increase of $p_t$
fluctuations with $n_{ch}$ (or A-A centrality) and collision energy, consistent
with previous measurements at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC). The
$p_t$ fluctuation data for LHC p-p collisions can be described accurately by a
two-component (soft+hard) model (TCM) in which the hard component represents
dijet production. The data for Pb-Pb collisions are described accurately by a
TCM reference for more-peripheral collisions (suggesting transparent
collisions), but the data deviate quantitatively from the reference for
more-central collisions suggesting modification of jet formation. Overall
fluctuation data trends suggest that minimum-bias jets (minijets) dominate
$p_t$ fluctuations at both the LHC and RHIC.

quadrilateral grids. This approach is an extension of the straight mortar
method originally designed for stationary domains by Kopriva, it employs curved
dynamic mortars on sliding-mesh interfaces to couple rotating and stationary
domains. On the nonconforming sliding-mesh interfaces, the related variables
are first projected from cell faces to mortars to compute common fluxes, and
then the common fluxes are projected back from the mortars to the cell faces to
ensure conservation. To verify the spatial order of accuracy of the
sliding-mesh spectral difference (SSD) method, both inviscid and viscous flow
cases are tested. It is shown that the SSD method preserves the high-order
accuracy of the SD method. Meanwhile, the SSD method is found to be very
efficient in terms of computational cost. This novel sliding-mesh interface
method is very suitable for parallel processing with domain decomposition. It
can be applied to a wide range of problems, such as the aerodynamics of
rotorcraft, wind turbines, and oscillating wing wind power generators, etc.

some natural extensions, for a general setting where the valuations of the
buyers are drawn from a correlated distribution. Sequential posted price
mechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a
take-it-or-leave-it offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted price
mechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands
only one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the
buyers. For standard sequential posted price mechanisms, we prove that with the
valuation distribution having finite support, no sequential posted price
mechanism can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even
with unlimited supply. We extend this result to the the case of a continuous
valuation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously.
In fact, it turns out that the best fraction of the optimal revenue that is
extractable by a sequential posted price mechanism is proportional to ratio of
the highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that for two simple
generalizations of these mechanisms, a better revenue performance can be
achieved: if the sequential posted price mechanism has for each buyer the
option of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then
a Omega(1/max{1,d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d
denotes the degree of dependence of the valuations, ranging from complete
independence (d=0) to arbitrary dependence (d=n-1). Moreover, when we
generalize the sequential posted price mechanisms further, such that the
mechanism has the ability to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the i-th buyer
that depends on the valuations of all buyers except i's, we prove that a
constant fraction (2-sqrt{e})/4~0.088 of the optimal revenue can be always be

the connection between the spectral gap property (SG$\_2$) of $P$ on

One of the tools used is to determine the maximum possible number of matrices

solids is that the mass (size) distribution of pieces is described by a power
law functional form. The exponent of the distribution displays a high degree of
universality depending mainly on the dimensionality and on the brittle-ductile
mechanical response of the system. Recently, experiments and computer
simulations have reported an energy dependence of the exponent increasing with
the imparted energy. These novel findings question the phase transition picture
of fragmentation phenomena, and have also practical importance for industrial
applications. Based on large scale computer simulations here we uncover a
robust mechanism which leads to the emergence of energy dependence in
fragmentation processes resolving controversial issues on the problem: studying
the impact induced breakup of plate-like objects with varying thickness in
three dimensions we show that energy dependence occurs when a lower dimensional
fragmenting object is embedded into a higher dimensional space. The reason is
an underlying transition between two distinct fragmentation mechanisms
controlled by the impact velocity at low plate thicknesses, while it is
hindered for three-dimensional bulk systems. The mass distributions of the
subsets of fragments dominated by the two cracking mechanisms proved to have an
astonishing robustness at all plate thicknesses, which implies that the
non-universality of the complete mass distribution is the consequence of
blending the contributions of universal partial processes.

$C^2$ functions corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian. The
theorem allows one to extend an a.e lower bound on this largest ""eigenvalue"" to
a bound holding everywhere. Via the Dirichlet duality theory of Harvey and
Lawson, this result has been key to recent progress on the fully non-linear,
elliptic Dirchlet problem. Second, we give a dual interpretation of this
largest eigenvalue using the Legendre-Fenchel transform, and use this dual
perspective to provide an alternative proof to an important step in the proof
of the theorem.

of the mechanism is done in a systematic way by considering the dual

isotopic composition. Consequences for other \oq Fe group\cqb elements are then
explored. They include $^{50}$Ti excesses, and some production of
$^{46,47,49}$Ti. In many circumstellar condensates, Ti quantitatively reflects
these effects of AGB neutron captures. Scatter in the data results from small
variations (granularity) in the isotopic composition of the local ISM. For Si,
the main effects are instead due to variations in the local ISM from different
SNe sources. The problem of Ca is discussed, particularly with regard to
$^{48}$Ca. The measured data are usually represented assuming terrestrial

that classical driving can drastically enhance the QFI, namely, the precision
of parameter estimation in the non-Markovian regime. Moreover, the

emphasis on the structural instability of the rutile compounds toward
dimerization. Ti substitution experiments reveal that the MIT is robust up to
20% Ti substitutions and occurs even in extremely thin V-rich lamellas in
spinodally decomposed TiO2-VO2 composites, indicating that the MIT is
insensitive to hole doping and essentially takes on a local character. These
observations suggest that either electron correlation in the Mott-Hubbard sense
or Peierls (Fermi-surface) instability plays a minor role on the MIT. Through a
broad perspective of crystal chemistry on the rutile-related compounds, it is
noted that VO2 and another MIT compound NbO2 in the family eventually lie just
near the borderline between the two structural groups with the regular rutile
structure and the distorted structures characterized by the formation of dimers
with direct metal-metal bonding. The MITs of VO2 and NbO2 are natural
consequences of structural transitions between the two groups, as all the d
electrons are trapped in the bonding molecular orbitals of dimers at low
temperatures. Such dimer crystals are ubiquitously found in early transition
metal compounds having chain-like structures, such as MoBr3, NbCl4, Ti4O7, and
V4O7, the latter two of which also exhibit MITs probably of the same origin. In
a broader sense, the dimer crystal is a kind of molecular orbital crystals in
which virtual molecules made of transition metal atoms with partially-filled
t2g shells, such as dimers, trimers or larger ones, are generated by
metal-metal bonding and are embedded into edge- or face-sharing octahedron
networks of various kinds. The molecular orbital crystallization opens a
natural route to stabilization of unpaired t2g electrons in crystals.

non-robust phenomenon that is very hard to maintain in the presence of noise,
or non-zero temperatures. In recent years however, and motivated, in part, by a
quest for a quantum analog of the PCP theorem researches have tried to
establish whether or not we can preserve quantum entanglement at ""constant""
temperatures that are independent of system size. This would imply that any
quantum state with energy at most, say 0.05 of the total available energy of
the Hamiltonian, would be highly-entangled. To this date, no such systems were
found, and moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians
on robust, albeit ""non-physical"" topologies, namely expanders, does not
guarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such
robustness may be possible after all: We construct an infinite family of
O(1)-local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum
error-correcting code with the following property of inapproximability: any
quantum state with energy at most 0.05 w.r.t. the total available energy cannot
be even approximately simulated by classical circuits of bounded
(sub-logarithmic) depth. In a sense, this implies that even providing a
""witness"" to the fact that the local Hamiltonian can be ""almost"" satisfied,
already requires some measure of long-range entanglement. Our construction is
but a first step in what, we believe, is a whole range of possible entanglement
- robust local Hamiltonians. A natural next step, we believe, is to devise such
local Hamiltonians that resist approximation in terms of bounded-depth quantum
circuits (e.g. NLTS), and even find such robust forms of entanglement that are
useful for some computation.

wire lateral dimensions of sub-10 nm and lengths of 700 nm or more have been

through etching times wherein the underlying cause is the merging of the nearby
crystallographic hexagonal etch pits. The emission processes involving excitons
are found to be efficient and lead to enhanced emission characteristics. The
exciton binding energy is augmented by using quantum confinement whereby
enforcing greater overlap of the electron-hole wave-function. The surviving
nanowires are nearly defect-free, have large exciton binding energies of around
45 meV and a small temperature variation of the output electroluminescent
light. We have observed superluminescent behaviour of the LEDs formed on these

400 A/cm2. The present work thus provides an innovative and cost effective
manner of device fabrication on the formed nanowires and proves the immediate

2.5 keV the best case to determine the neutrino mass by electron capture. The
energy of the Q value is distributed between the excitation of Dysprosium (and
the neglected small recoil of Holmium) and the relativistic energy of the
emitted neutrino including the restmass. The reduction of the upper end of the
deexcitation spectrum of Dysprosium below the Q value allows to determine the
neutrino mass. The excitation of Dysprosium can be calculated in the sudden
approximation of the overlap of the electron wave functions of Holmium minus
the captured electron and one-, two-, three- and multiple hole-excitations in
Dysprosium. Robertson and the author have calculated the influence of the
two-hole states on the Dysprosium deexitation spectrum. Here for the first time
the influence of the three-hole states on the deexcitation bolometer spectrum
of 163 Dysprosium is presented. The electron wave functions and the overlaps
are calculated selfconsitently in a fully relativistic and antisymmetrized
Dirac-Hartree-Fock approach in Holmium and in Dysprosium. The electron orbitals
in Dysprosium are determined including the one-hole states in the
selfconsistent iteration. The influence of the three-hole states on the
deexcitation (by X-rays and Auger electrons) spectrum is hardly visible. The
three-hole states seem not to be important for the determination of the
neutrino mass.

existence is motivated by the central limit theorem. The later result is a
rather weaker version of a theorem that is due to Michel Talagrand. Using ideas
from the theory of Bernstein polynomials, we show that the Bernstein-Hoeffding
method can be adapted to case in which one has information on higher moments of
the random variables. Moreover, we consider the performance of the method under
additional information on the conditional distribution of the random variables

general weak random sources. The ultimate goal is to give a construction that
matches what is given by the probabilistic method --- an extractor for two
independent $n$-bit weak random sources with min-entropy as small as $\log
n+O(1)$. Previously, the best known result in the two-source case is an
extractor by Bourgain \cite{Bourgain05}, which works for min-entropy $0.49n$;
and the best known result in the general case is an earlier work of the author
\cite{Li13b}, which gives an extractor for a constant number of independent
sources with min-entropy $\mathsf{polylog(n)}$. However, the constant in the
construction of \cite{Li13b} depends on the hidden constant in the best known
seeded extractor, and can be large; moreover the error in that construction is
only $1/\mathsf{poly(n)}$.
  In this paper, we make two important improvements over the result in
\cite{Li13b}. First, we construct an explicit extractor for \emph{three}
independent sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy $k \geq \mathsf{polylog(n)}$.
In fact, our extractor works for one independent source with poly-logarithmic
min-entropy and another independent block source with two blocks each having
poly-logarithmic min-entropy. Thus, our result is nearly optimal, and the next
step would be to break the $0.49n$ barrier in two-source extractors. Second, we
improve the error of the extractor from $1/\mathsf{poly(n)}$ to
$2^{-k^{\Omega(1)}}$, which is almost optimal and crucial for cryptographic
applications. Some of the techniques developed here may be of independent
interests.
