regular undulations, called wrinkles, characterized by a spatially extended
energy distribution and a well-defined wavelength $\lambda$. As the confinement
increases, the deformation energy is progressively localized into a single
narrow fold. An exact solution for the deformation of an infinite sheet was
previously found, indicating that wrinkles in an infinite sheet are unstable
against localization for arbitrarily small confinement. We present an extension
of the theory to sheets of finite length $L$, accounting for the experimentally
observed wrinkle-to-fold transition. We derive an exact solution for the
periodic deformation in the wrinkled state, and an approximate solution for the
localized, folded state. We show that a second-order transition between these
two states occurs at a critical confinement $\Delta_F=\lambda^2/L$.

deployed to support a specific application. However, as WSN nodes are becoming

multiple applications could share a very same WSN infrastructure.
Virtualization is a technology that can potentially enable this sharing. This
paper is a survey on WSN virtualization. It provides a comprehensive review of
the state-of-the-art and an in-depth discussion of the research issues. We
introduce the basics of WSN virtualization and motivate its pertinence with
carefully selected scenarios. Existing works are presented in detail and
critically evaluated using a set of requirements derived from the scenarios.
The pertinent research projects are also reviewed. Several research issues are

self-assembled materials. The major hurdle in realizing crystal structures from
DNA-functionalized particles is expected to be kinetic barriers that trap the
system in metastable amorphous states. Therefore, it is vital to explore the
molecular details of particle assembly processes in order to understand the
underlying mechanisms. Molecular simulations based on coarse-grained models can
provide a convenient route to explore these details. Most of the currently
available coarse-grained models of DNA-functionalized particles ignore key
chemical and structural details of DNA behavior. These models therefore are
limited in scope for studying experimental phenomena. In this paper, we present
a new coarse-grained model of DNA-functionalized particles which incorporates
some of the desired features of DNA behavior. The coarse-grained DNA model used
here provides explicit DNA representation (at the nucleotide level) and
complementary interactions between Watson-Crick base pairs, which lead to the
formation of single-stranded hairpin and double-stranded DNA. Aggregation
between multiple complementary strands is also prevented in our model. We study
interactions between two DNA- functionalized particles as a function of DNA
grafting density, lengths of the hybridizing and non-hybridizing parts of DNA,
and temperature. The calculated free energies as a function of pair distance
between particles qualitatively resemble experimental measurements of
DNA-mediated pair interactions.

the effectiveness of a simple near-neighbor forecast technique that works with

detector for PbPb collisions at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV and pPb collisions at

Factorization is observed to be broken as a function of both particle pt and
eta. When measured with particles of different pt, the magnitude of the
factorization breakdown for the second Fourier harmonic reaches 20% for very
central PbPb collisions but decreases rapidly as the multiplicity decreases.
The data are consistent with viscous hydrodynamic predictions, which suggest
that the effect of factorization breaking is mainly sensitive to the
initial-state conditions rather than to the transport properties (e.g., shear
viscosity) of the medium. The factorization breakdown is also computed with
particles of different eta. The effect is found to be weakest for mid-central
PbPb events but becomes larger for more central or peripheral PbPb collisions,
and also for very high-multiplicity pPb collisions. The eta-dependent

structure function $S(q)$ of a one-component ion lattice and use it to
calculate the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of high-density solid matter
expected in the neutron star crust. By making detailed comparisons with the
results for the thermal conductivity obtained using standard techniques based
on the one-phonon approximation (OPA) valid at low temperature, and the
multi-phonon harmonic approximation expected to be valid over a wide range of
temperatures, we asses the temperature regime where $S(q)$ from QMC can be used
directly to calculate $\kappa$. We also compare the QMC results to those
obtained using classical Monte Carlo to quantitatively asses the magnitude of
the quantum corrections. We find that quantum effects became relevant for the
calculation of $\kappa$ at temperature $T \lesssim 0.3 ~\Omega_\mathrm{P}$,
where $\Omega_\mathrm{P}$ is the ion plasma frequency. At $T \simeq 0.1
~\Omega_\mathrm{P}$ the quantum effects suppress $\kappa$ by about $30\%$. The
comparison with the results of the OPA indicates that dynamical information
beyond the static structure is needed when $T \lesssim 0.1~ \Omega_\mathrm{P}$.
These quantitative comparisons help to establish QMC as a viable technique to
calculate $\kappa$ at moderate temperatures in the range
$T=0.1-1~\Omega_\mathrm{P}$ of relevance to the study of accreting neutron
stars. This finding is especially important because QMC is the only viable
technique so far for calculating $\kappa$ in multi-component systems at

First, we characterise continuous orbit equivalence in terms of isomorphisms of

analogue of the classical result by Singer and Feldman-Moore in the measurable
setting. Secondly, we turn to continuous orbit equivalence rigidity, i.e., the
question whether for certain classes of topological dynamical systems,
continuous orbit equivalence implies conjugacy. We show that this is not always
the case by constructing topological dynamical systems (actions of free abelian
groups, and also non-abelian free groups) which are continuously orbit
equivalent but not conjugate. Furthermore, we prove positive rigidity results.
For instance, it turns out that general topological Bernoulli actions are rigid
when compared with actions of nilpotent groups, and that topological Bernoulli
actions of duality groups are rigid when compared with actions of solvable
groups. The same is true for certain subshifts of full shifts over finite
alphabets.

multi-parameter Hamiltonians $H^{(\boldsymbol k,\bf \lambda)}$ carrying a
dependence on crystal momentum $\boldsymbol k$ and an additional periodic
parameter $\bf\lambda$, one usually constructs several sets of Wannier
functions for a set of values of $\bf\lambda$. We present the concept of higher
dimensional Wannier functions (HDWFs), which provide a minimal and accurate
description of the electronic structure of multi-parameter Hamiltonians based
on a single set of HDWFs. The obstacle of non-orthogonality of Bloch functions
at different $\bf\lambda$ is overcome by introducing an auxiliary real space,
which is reciprocal to the parameter $\bf\lambda$. We derive a generalized
interpolation scheme and emphasize the essential conceptual and computational
simplifications in using the formalism, for instance, in the evaluation of
linear response coefficients. We further implement the necessary machinery to
construct HDWFs from ab initio within the full-potential linearized augmented
plane-wave method (FLAPW). We apply our implementation to accurately
interpolate the Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional magnetic chain of Mn atoms in
two important cases of $\bf\lambda$: (i) the spin-spiral vector $\boldsymbol
q$, and (ii) the direction of the ferromagnetic magnetization $\hat{\boldsymbol
m}$. Using the generalized interpolation of the energy, we extract the
corresponding values of magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy, Heisenberg
exchange constants, and spin stiffness, which compare very well with the values
obtained from direct first principles calculations. For toy models we
demonstrate that the method of HDWFs can also be used in applications such as
the virtual crystal approximation, ferroelectric polarization and spin torques.

While other mechanisms may also play a role, adhesion always involves the
fluctuations of deformable membranes, the diffusion of proteins and the
molecular binding and unbinding. Because these stochastic processes couple over
a multitude of time and length scales, theoretical modeling of membrane
adhesion has been a major challenge. Here we present an effective Monte Carlo
scheme within which the effects of the membrane are integrated into local rates
for molecular recognition. The latter step in the Monte Carlo approach enables
us to simulate the nucleation and growth of adhesion domains within a system of
the size of a cell for tens of seconds without loss of accuracy, as shown by
comparison to $10^6$ times more expensive Langevin simulations. To perform this
validation, the Langevin approach was augmented to simulate diffusion of
proteins explicitly, together with reaction kinetics and membrane dynamics. We
use the Monte Carlo scheme to gain deeper insight to the experimentally
observed radial growth of micron sized adhesion domains, and connect the
effective rate with which the domain is growing to the underlying microscopic
events. We thus demonstrate that our technique yields detailed information
about protein transport and complexation in membranes, which is a fundamental
step toward understanding even more complex membrane interactions in the

data size, high degrees of freedom, and many hardware constraints.
High-performance graphics processing units have been used to speed up the
computations. However, its small memory size cannot handle cases with a large
dose-deposition coefficient (DDC) matrix. This paper is to report an
implementation of our column-generation based VMAT algorithm on a multi-GPU
platform to solve the memory limitation problem. The column-generation approach
generates apertures sequentially by solving a pricing problem (PP) and a master
problem (MP) iteratively. The DDC matrix is split into four sub-matrices
according to beam angles, stored on four GPUs in compressed sparse row format.
Computation of beamlet price is accomplished using multi-GPU. While the
remaining steps of PP and MP problems are implemented on a single GPU due to
their modest computational loads. A H&N patient case was used to validate our
method. We compare our multi-GPU implementation with three single GPU
implementation strategies: truncating DDC matrix (S1), repeatedly transferring
DDC matrix between CPU and GPU (S2), and porting computations involving DDC
matrix to CPU (S3). Two more H&N patient cases and three prostate cases were
also used to demonstrate the advantages of our method. Our multi-GPU
implementation can finish the optimization within ~1 minute for the H&N patient
case. S1 leads to an inferior plan quality although its total time was 10
seconds shorter than the multi-GPU implementation. S2 and S3 yield same plan
quality as the multi-GPU implementation but take ~4 minutes and ~6 minutes,
respectively. High computational efficiency was consistently achieved for the
other 5 cases. The results demonstrate that the multi-GPU implementation can
handle the large-scale VMAT optimization problem efficiently without
sacrificing plan quality.

radiation dose calculations. Accuracy of a source model for a linear
accelerator is critical for the overall dose calculation accuracy. In this
paper, we presented an analytical source model that we recently developed for
GPU-based MC dose calculations. A key concept called phase-space-ring (PSR) was
proposed. It contained a group of particles that are of the same type and close
in energy and radial distance to the center of the phase-space plane. The model
parameterized probability densities of particle location, direction and energy
for each primary photon PSR, scattered photon PSR and electron PSR. For a
primary photon PSRs, the particle direction is assumed to be from the beam
spot. A finite spot size is modeled with a 2D Gaussian distribution. For a
scattered photon PSR, multiple Gaussian components were used to model the
particle direction. The direction distribution of an electron PSRs was also
modeled as a 2D Gaussian distribution with a large standard deviation. We also
developed a method to analyze a phase-space file and derive corresponding model
parameters. To test the accuracy of our linac source model, dose distributions
of different open fields in a water phantom were calculated using our source
model and compared to those directly calculated using the reference phase-space
file. The average distance-to-agreement (DTA) was within 1 mm for the depth
dose in the build-up region and beam penumbra regions. The root-mean-square
(RMS) dose difference was within 1.1% for dose profiles at inner and outer beam
regions. The maximal relative difference of output factors was within 0.5%.
Good agreements were also found in an IMRT prostate patient case and an IMRT

this paper, we present a sampling strategy to efficiently utilize this source
model in GPU-based dose calculation. Our source model was based on a concept of
phase-space-ring (PSR). This ring structure makes it effective to account for
beam rotational symmetry, but not suitable for dose calculations due to
rectangular jaw settings. Hence, we first convert PSR source model to its
phase-space let (PSL) representation. Then in dose calculation, different types
of sub-sources were separately sampled. Source sampling and particle transport
were iterated. So that the particles being sampled and transported
simultaneously are of same type and close in energy to alleviate GPU thread
divergence. We also present an automatic commissioning approach to adjust the
model for a good representation of a clinical linear accelerator . Weighting
factors were introduced to adjust relative weights of PSRs, determined by
solving a quadratic minimization problem with a non-negativity constraint. We
tested the efficiency gain of our model over a previous source model using PSL
files. The efficiency was improved by 1.70 ~ 4.41, due to the avoidance of long
data reading and transferring. The commissioning problem can be solved in ~20
sec. Its efficacy was tested by comparing the doses computed using the
commissioned model and the uncommissioned one, with measurements in different
open fields in a water phantom under a clinical Varian Truebeam 6MV beam. For
the depth dose curves, the average distance-to-agreement was improved from
0.04~0.28 cm to 0.04~0.12 cm for build-up region and the root-mean-square (RMS)
dose difference after build-up region was reduced from 0.32%~0.67% to

interdisciplinary area, crossing traditionally distinct scientific boundaries.
Following the paper of Erlykin et al. (Astropart. Phys. 57--58 (2014) 26--29)
we develop the interpretation of observed changes in long-wave (LW) radiation
(Aplin and Lockwood, Env. Res. Letts. 8, 015026 (2013)), by taking account of
cosmic ray ionisation yields and atmospheric radiative transfer. To demonstrate
this, we show that the thermal structure of the whole atmosphere needs to be
considered along with the vertical profile of ionisation. Allowing for
ionisation by all components of a cosmic ray shower and not just by the muons,
reveals that the effect we have detected is certainly not inconsistent with
laboratory observations of the LW absorption cross section. The analysis
presented here, although very different from that of Erlykin et al., does come
to the same conclusion that the events detected were not caused by individual
cosmic ray primaries -- not because it is impossible on energetic grounds, but
because events of the required energy are too infrequent for the 12/hr rate at
which they were seen by the AL experiment. The present paper numerically models
the effect of three different scenario changes to the primary GCR spectrum
which all reproduce the required magnitude of the observed effect. However,
they cannot solely explain the observed delay in the peak effect which, if
confirmed, would appear to open up a whole new and interesting area in the
study of water oligomers and their effects on LW radiation. We argue that a
technical artefact in the earlier experiment is highly unlikely and that our
initial observations merit both follow-up experiments and more rigorous,
self-consistent, three-dimensional radiative transfer modelling.

permit the study of system performance under typical handling of double-talk

equivalent to a linearly-constrained minimum variance problem. Hence, the
derived analytical model can be used to predict the transient performance of
general adaptive wideband beamformers. We study the transient and steady-state
behaviors of the residual mean echo power for stationary Gaussian inputs. A
convergence analysis leads to stability bounds for the step-size matrix and
design guidelines are derived from the analytical models. Monte Carlo
simulations illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical models and the
applicability of the proposed design guidelines. Examples include operation
under mild degrees of nonstationarity. Finally, we show how a high convergence

graphene-based single-layer and few-layer spin-valve devices. We give an
overview of challenges and recent advances in the field of device fabrication
and discuss two of our fabrication methods in more detail which result in
distinctly different device performances. In the first class of devices, Co/MgO
electrodes are directly deposited onto graphene which results in rough
MgO-to-Co interfaces and favor the formation of conducting pinholes throughout
the MgO layer. We show that the contact resistance area product (R$_c$A) is a
benchmark for spin transport properties as it scales with the measured spin
lifetime in these devices indicating that contact-induced spin dephasing is the
bottleneck for spin transport even in devices with large R$_c$A values. In a
second class of devices, Co/MgO electrodes are first patterned onto a silicon
substrate. Subsequently, a graphene-hBN heterostructure is directly transferred
onto these prepatterned electrodes which provides improved interface
properties. This is seen by a strong enhancement of both charge and spin
transport properties yielding charge carrier mobilities exceeding 20000
cm$^2$/(Vs) and spin lifetimes up to 3.7 ns at room temperature. We discuss
several shortcomings in the determination of both quantities which complicates
the analysis of both extrinsic and intrinsic spin scattering mechanisms.
Furthermore, we show that contacts can be the origin of a second charge
neutrality point in gate dependent resistance measurements which is influenced
by the quantum capacitance of the underlying graphene layer.

convex in G if the left G-set G/H has at least one G-invariant order; when G is
left orderable, this holds if and only if H is convex in G under some left
ordering of G.
  We give a criterion for H to be left relatively convex in G that generalizes
a famous theorem of Burns and Hale and has essentially the same proof. We show
that all maximal cyclic subgroups are left relatively convex in free groups, in
right-angled Artin groups, and in surface groups that are not the Klein-bottle
group. The free-group case extends a result of Duncan and Howie.
  We show that if G is left orderable, then each free factor of G is left
relatively convex in G. More generally, for any graph of groups, if each edge
group is left relatively convex in each of its vertex groups, then each vertex
group is left relatively convex in the fundamental group; this generalizes a
result of Chiswell.
  We show that all maximal cyclic subgroups in locally residually torsion-free
nilpotent groups are left relatively convex.

(which is designed for binary data). In this paper, we demonstrate, through an
extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel
often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. As the
min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial
applications with massive data, we show that the min-max kernel can be
linearized via hashing techniques. This allows practitioners to apply min-max
kernel to large-scale applications using well matured linear algorithms such as
linear SVM or logistic regression.
  The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces
samples in the form of ($i^*, t^*$) where the $i^*$ records the location (and
in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by
classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the $t^*$ is theoretically
unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for
building large-scale linear classifiers. In this paper, we provide a simple
solution by discarding $t^*$ (which we refer to as the ""0-bit"" scheme). Via an
extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose
essential information. We then apply the ""0-bit"" CWS for building linear
classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers, as extensively validated
on a wide range of publicly available classification datasets. We expect this
work will generate interests among data mining practitioners who would like to
efficiently utilize the nonlinear information of non-binary and nonnegative

explanation of two equal-mass degenerate objects with a total mass larger than
the Chandrasekhar limiting mass that supposedly will merge in less than a
Hubble time, possibly leading to a SN~Ia, is controversial. This hypothesis
relies on the assumption that the variability of the He II 5412A spectral line
is due to two absorption components. Instead, we propose that it can be
accounted for by a broad absorption line from the central system on top of
which there is a narrow emission line from the nebula. This prompted us to
study if the binary system can be made of a degenerate star and a low-mass main
sequence companion, or of two degenerate objects of smaller mass. We find that
although both scenarios can account for the existence of two symmetric broad
minima in the light curve, the second one agrees better with observations. We
thus argue that the claim that Henize 2-428 provides observational evidence
supporting the double-degenerate scenario for SN~Ia is premature.

momentum from non-gravitational forces after binary formation is a possible
explanation. The two components have similar radar reflectivity, suggesting a
similar composition consistent with formation by spin-up. The secondary appears
to exhibit a larger circular polarization ratio than the primary, suggesting a

devoted to the previous interesting special case $\alpha=\beta.$ In particular,
we give further computational improvements, as well as some useful explicit and

restricted Paley-Wiener space, we relate the GPSWFs to the solutions of a
generalized energy maximisation problem. As a consequence, many desirable
spectral properties of the self-adjoint compact integral operator associated
with the GPSWFs are deduced from the rich literature of the PSWFs. In
particular, we show that the GPSWFs are well adapted for the spectral
approximation of the classical $c-$band-limited as well as almost

LAEs at these redshifts is $\sim$10%, which is consistent with previous
observations. We compared best-fit SED-estimated stellar parameters of the
SFG$_{\rm N}$, SFG$_{\rm L}$ and LAE samples. For the luminosities probed here
($\sim$L$^*$), we find that galaxies with and without Ly$\alpha$ in emission
have small but significant differences in their SED-based properties. We find
that LAEs have less dust, and lower star-formation rates (SFR) compared to
non-LAEs. We also find that LAEs are less massive compared to non-LAEs, though
the difference is smaller and less significant compared to the SFR and E$_{\rm

attention because of the so called Basel Accord. In particular the Basel III
Accord asks the banks to fulfill finer conditions concerning counterparty
credit exposures arising from banks' derivatives, securities financing
transactions, default and downgrade risks characterizing the Over The Counter
(OTC) derivatives market, etc. Consequently the development of effective and
more accurate measures of risk have been pushed, particularly focusing on the
estimate of the future fair value of derivatives with respect to prescribed
time horizon and fixed grid of time buckets. Standard methods used to treat the
latter scenario are mainly based on ad hoc implementations of the classic Monte
Carlo (MC) approach, which is characterized by a high computational time,
strongly dependent on the number of considered assets. This is why many
financial players moved to more enhanced Technologies, e.g., grid computing and
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) capabilities. In this paper we show how to
implement the quantization technique, in order to accurately estimate both
pricing and volatility values. Our approach is tested to produce effective
results for the counterparty risk evaluation, with a big improvement concerning
required time to run when compared to MC approach.

evolution operator can be constructed in many different ways, corresponding to
different trajectories between the desired end-points and different series
expansions. A choice among these possibilities can then be made to obtain the
best computational complexity and control over errors. It is shown how a
construction based on Grover's algorithm scales linearly in time and
logarithmically in the error bound, and is exponentially superior in error
complexity to the scheme based on the straightforward application of the
Lie-Trotter formula. The strategy is then extended first to simulation of any
Hamiltonian that is a linear combination of two projection operators, and then
to any local efficiently computable Hamiltonian. The key feature is to
construct an evolution in terms of the largest possible steps instead of taking
small time steps. Reflection operations and Chebyshev expansions are used to
efficiently control the total error on the overall evolution, without worrying
about discretisation errors for individual steps. We also use a digital
implementation of quantum states that makes linear algebra operations rather
simple to perform.

Using the replica method, our Lagrangian formalism maintains gauge invariance
on the lattice. At $O(\beta^{2})$ and $O(\beta^{3})$, the entanglement entropy
is solely contributed by the central plaquettes enclosing the conical
singularity of the $n$-sheeted Riemann surface. The area law emerges naturally
to the highest order $O(\beta^{3})$ of our calculation. The leading $O(\beta)$
term is negative, which could in principle be canceled by taking into account
the ""cosmological constant"" living in interface of the two entangled
subregions. This unknown cosmological constant resembles the ambiguity of edge
modes in the Hamiltonian formalism. We further speculate this unknown
cosmological constant can show up in the entanglement entropy of scalar and
spinor field theories as well. Furthermore, it could play the role of a
counterterm to absorb the ultraviolet divergence of entanglement entropy and
make entanglement entropy a finite physical quantity.

Ginzburg-Landau-type non-linear sigma model theory, but with an additional
multi-kink domain-wall topological term. Such theory has an anomalous $U^k(1)$

theory, which is beyond Abelian Chern-Simons/BF gauge theories. We argue that
the two field theories are equivalent at low energies. After coupling to the
symmetry twists, both theories produce the desired SPT invariant.

system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism,
general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a
small boundary in initial inclinations and initial semi-major axes that result
in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of alpha Cen B b to its present
location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr
against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with
alpha Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates
in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46-53
degrees relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the initial inclination of

and decay to lighter dark-sector states which subsequently decay to the
Standard Model. Such scenarios - with annihilation followed by cascading
dark-sector decays - can explain the apparent excess GeV gamma-rays identified
in the central Milky Way, while evading bounds from dark matter direct
detection experiments. Each 'step' in the cascade will modify the observable
signatures of dark matter annihilation and decay, shifting the resulting
photons and other final state particles to lower energies and broadening their
spectra. We explore, in a model-independent way, the effect of multi-step
dark-sector cascades on the preferred regions of parameter space to explain the
GeV excess. We find that the broadening effects of multi-step cascades can
admit final states dominated by particles that would usually produce too
sharply peaked photon spectra; in general, if the cascades are hierarchical
(each particle decays to substantially lighter particles), the preferred mass
range for the dark matter is in all cases 20-150 GeV. Decay chains that have
nearly-degenerate steps, where the products are close to half the mass of the
progenitor, can admit much higher DM masses. We map out the region of
mass/cross-section parameter space where cascades (degenerate, hierarchical or
a combination) can fit the signal, for a range of final states. In the current
work, we study multi-step cascades in the context of explaining the GeV excess,

geometry of a dust cloud collapsing to form a black hole, everywhere in the
(1+1) spacetime: that is, both inside and outside the event horizon and
arbitrarily close to the curvature singularity. This allows us to determine the
regularized stress tensor expectation value, everywhere in the appropriate
quantum state (viz., the Unruh vacuum) of the field. We use this to study the
behaviour of energy density and the flux measured in local inertial frames for
the radially freely falling observer at any given event. Outside the black
hole, energy density and flux lead to the standard results expected from the
Hawking radiation emanating from the black hole, as the collapse proceeds.
Inside the collapsing dust ball, the energy densities of both matter and scalar
field diverge near the singularity in both (1+1) and (1+3) spacetime
dimensions; but the energy density of the field dominates over that of
classical matter. In the (1+3) dimensions, the total energy (of both scalar
field and classical matter) inside a small spatial volume around the
singularity is finite (and goes to zero as the size of the region goes to zero)
but the total energy of the quantum field still dominates over that of the
classical matter. Inside the event horizon, but \textit{outside} the collapsing
matter, freely falling observers find that the energy density and the flux
diverge close to the singularity. In this region, even the integrated energy
inside a small spatial volume enclosing the singularity diverges. This result
holds in both (1+1) and (1+3) spacetime dimensions with a \emph{milder}
divergence for the total energy inside a small region in (1+3) dimensions.
These results suggest that the back-reaction effects are significant even in
the region \emph{outside the matter but inside the event horizon}, close to the
singularity.

Structures (EFTofLSS) for the matter power spectrum at different redshifts. In
previous work, we found that the two-loop prediction can match the nonlinear
power spectrum measured from $N$-body simulations at redshift zero within
approximately 2% up to $k\sim 0.6\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ after fixing a single
free parameter, the so-called ""speed of sound"". We determine the time evolution
of this parameter by matching the EFTofLSS prediction to simulation output at
different redshifts, and find that it is well-described by a fitting function
that only includes one additional parameter. After the two free parameters are
fixed, the prediction agrees with nonlinear data within approximately 2% up to
at least $k\sim 1\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z\geq 1$, and also within
approximately 5% up to $k\sim 1.2\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=1$ and $k\sim
2.3\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=3$, a major improvement with respect to other
perturbative techniques. We also develop an accurate way to estimate where the
EFTofLSS predictions at different loop orders should fail, based on the sizes
of the next-order terms that are neglected, and find agreement with the actual
comparisons to data. Finally, we use our matter power spectrum results to
perform analytical calculations of lensing potential power spectra
corresponding to both CMB and galaxy lensing. This opens the door to future
direct applications of the EFTofLSS to observations of gravitational clustering
on cosmic scales.

exoplanets, Galactic evolution, and stellar structure, methods for precisely
measuring their fundamental stellar properties remain elusive. Existing
techniques for measuring M dwarf luminosity, mass, radius, or composition are
calibrated over a limited range of stellar parameters or require expensive
observations. We find a strong correlation between the $K_S$-band luminosity
($M_K$), the observed strength of the $I$-band sodium doublet absorption
feature, and [Fe/H] in M dwarfs without strong H$\alpha$ emission. We show that
the strength of this feature, coupled with [Fe/H] and spectral type, can be
used to derive M dwarf $M_K$ and radius without requiring parallax.
Additionally, we find promising evidence that the strengths of the $I$-band
sodium doublet and the nearby $I$-band calcium triplet may jointly indicate
$\alpha$-element enrichment. The use of these $I$-band features requires only
moderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy to provide valuable information
about the potential habitability of exoplanets around M dwarfs, and surface
gravity and distance for M dwarfs throughout the Galaxy. This technique has
immediate applicability for both target selection and candidate planet host
system characterization for exoplanet missions such as \textit{TESS} and
\textit{K2}.

regulate both star formation and black hole growth. Despite their ubiquitous
presence, the origin and the acceleration mechanism of such powerful and
extended winds is not yet understood. Direct observations of the cold gas
component in objects with detected outflows at other wavelengths are needed to
assess the impact of the outflow on the host galaxy interstellar medium (ISM).
We observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer an obscured quasar at
z~1.5, XID2028, for which the presence of an ionised outflow has been
unambiguously signalled by NIR spectroscopy. The detection of CO(3-2) emission
in this source allows us to infer the molecular gas content and compare it to
the ISM mass derived from the dust emission. We then analyze the results in the
context of recent insights on scaling relations, which describe the gas content
of the overall population of star-forming galaxies at a similar redshifts. The
Star formation efficiency (~100) and gas mass (M_gas=2.1-9.5x10^{10} M_sun)
inferred from the CO(3-2) line depend on the underlying assumptions on the
excitation of the transition and the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. However, the
combination of this information and the ISM mass estimated from the dust mass
suggests that the ISM/gas content of XID2028 is significantly lower than
expected for its observed M$_\star$, sSFR and redshift, based on the most
up-to-date calibrations (with gas fraction <20% and depletion time scale <340

simple to analyze we focus on the multiple photon processes allowed in the low
frequency regime to unveil the hierarchy of Floquet edge-states. In the case of
low intensities an analytical approach allows us to derive effective
Hamiltonians and address the topological character of each gap in a
constructive manner. At high intensities we obtain the net number of edge
states, given by the winding number, with a numerical calculation of the Chern

resembles that of a Russian nesting doll. This hierarchy classifies the gaps
and the associated edge states in different orders according to the
electron-photon coupling strength. For large driving intensities, we rely on
the numerical calculation of the winding number, illustrated in a map of
topological phase transitions. The hierarchy unveiled with the low energy
effective Hamiltonians, alongside with the map of topological phase transitions
discloses the complexity of the Floquet band structure in the low frequency

easily adapted to other Dirac Hamiltonians of two dimensional materials and

  linearly constrained problem","25 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It has been shown that a global minimizer of a smooth determinant of a matrix
function corresponds to the largest cycle of a graph. When it exists, this is a
Hamiltonian cycle. Finding global minimizers even of a smooth function is a
challenge. The difficulty is often exacerbated by the existence of many global
minimizers. One may think this would help, but in the case of Hamiltonian
cycles the ratio of the number of global minimizers to the number of local
minimizers is typically astronomically small. There are various equivalent
forms of the problem and here we report on two.
  Although the focus is on finding Hamiltonian cycles, and this has an interest
in and of itself, this is just a proxy for a class of problems that have
discrete variables. The solution of relaxations of these problems is typically
at a degenerate vertex, and in the neighborhood of the solution the Hessian is
indefinite. The form of the Hamiltonian cycle problem we address has the virtue
of being an ideal test problem for algorithms designed for discrete nonlinear
problems in general. It is easy to generate problems of varying size and
varying character, and they have the advantage of being able to determine if a
global solution has been found. A feature of many discrete problems is that
there are many solutions. For example, in the frequency assignment problem any
permutation of a solution is also a solution. A consequence is that a common
characteristic of the relaxed problems is that they have large numbers of

matching the sides of discs and properly gluing them together. Encoding the
surface in a random permutation $\gamma$ of $[N]$, we use the Fourier transform
on $S_N$ to show that $\gamma$ is asymptotic to the permutation distributed
uniformly on the alternating group $A_N$ ($A_N^c$ resp.) if $N-n$ and $N/2$ are
of the same (opposite resp.) parity. We use this to prove a local central limit
theorem for the number of vertices on the surface, whence for its Euler
characteristic $\chi$. We also show that with high probability the random
surface consists of a single component, and thus has a well-defined genus
$g=1-\chi/2$, which is asymptotic to a Gaussian random variable, with mean
$(N/2-n-\log N)/2$ and variance $(\log N)/2$.

differential geometry, topology, functional and microlocal analysis, causality
and general relativity will be summarised, and the algebraic approach to QFT on
curved spacetime will be reviewed. Apart from these foundations, the original
research of the author and his collaborators will be presented: Together with
Fewster, the author studied the up and down structure of permutations using
their decomposition into so-called atomic permutations. The relevance of these
results to this thesis is their application in the calculation of the moments
of quadratic quantum fields. In a work with Pinamonti, the author showed the
local and global existence of solutions to the semiclassical Einstein equation
in flat cosmological spacetimes coupled to a scalar field by solving
simultaneously for the quantum state and the Hubble function in an
integral-functional equation. The theorem is proved with a fixed-point theorem
using the continuous functional differentiability and boundedness of the
integral kernel of the integral-functional equation. In another work with
Pinamonti the author proposed an extension of the semiclassical Einstein
equations which couples the moments of a stochastic Einstein tensor to the
moments of the quantum stress-energy tensor. In a toy model of a Newtonianly
perturbed exponentially expanding spacetime it is shown that the quantum
fluctuations of the stress-energy tensor induce an almost scale-invariant power
spectrum for the perturbation potential and that non-Gaussianties arise
naturally.

Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The N$_2$H$^+$ emission is
found to be relatively weak near the hot core and the outflows, and its
distribution is clearly anti-correlated with the CS emission. This result
indicates that a young outflow is interacting with cold ambient gas. The
HN$^{13}$C emission is compact and mostly emanates from the hot core, whereas
the DNC emission is extended around the hot core. Thus, the DNC and HN$^{13}$C
emission traces warm regions near the protostar differently. The DNC emission
is stronger than the HN$^{13}$C emission toward most parts of this clump. The
DNC/HNC abundance ratio averaged within a $15^{\prime\prime} \times
15^{\prime\prime}$ area around the phase center is higher than 0.06. This ratio
is much higher than the value obtained by the previous single-dish observations
of DNC and HN$^{13}$C $J$=1--0 ($\sim$0.003). It seems likely that the DNC and
HNC emission observed with the single-dish telescope traces lower density
envelopes, while that observed with ALMA traces higher density and highly
deuterated regions. We have compared the observational results with
chemical-model results in order to investigate the behavior of DNC and HNC in
the dense cores. Taking these results into account, we suggest that the low
DNC/HNC ratio in the high-mass sources obtained by the single-dish observations
are at least partly due to the low filling factor of the high density regions.

i.e.\ globally fixed subspaces in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, a
\emph{pinned subspace-incidence system} is the pair $(H, X)$, with the
constraint that each pin in $X$ lies on the subspace spanned by the point
realizations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of vertices of the corresponding hyperedge of
$H$. We are interested in combinatorial characterization of pinned
subspace-incidence systems that are \emph{minimally rigid}, i.e.\ those systems
that are guaranteed to generically yield a locally unique realization. As is
customary, this is accompanied by a characterization of generic independence as
well as rigidity.
  In a previous paper \cite{sitharam2014incidence}, we used pinned
subspace-incidence systems towards solving the \emph{fitted dictionary
learning} problem, i.e.\ dictionary learning with specified underlying
hypergraph, and gave a combinatorial characterization of minimal rigidity for a
more restricted version of pinned subspace-incidence system, with $H$ being a
uniform hypergraph and pins in $X$ being 1-dimension subspaces. Moreover in a
recent paper \cite{Baker2015}, the special case of pinned line incidence
systems was used to model biomaterials such as cellulose and collagen fibrils
in cell walls. In this paper, we extend the combinatorial characterization to
general pinned subspace-incidence systems, with $H$ being a non-uniform
hypergraph and pins in $X$ being subspaces with arbitrary dimension. As there
are generally many data points per subspace in a dictionary learning problem,
which can only be modeled with pins of dimension larger than $1$, such an
extension enables application to a much larger class of fitted dictionary
learning problems.

subluminal (slower-than-light). This means that, if the polytrope treated in

bands, centred close to 730, 1400 and 3100 MHz, using a dual-band 10 cm/50 cm
receiver and the central beam of the 20 cm multibeam receiver. Observations
spanning approximately six years have been carefully calibrated and summed to
produce high S/N profiles. This allows us to study the individual profile
components and in particular how they evolve with frequency. We also identify
previously undetected profile features. For many pulsars we show that pulsed
emission extends across almost the entire pulse profile. The pulse component
widths and component separations follow a complex evolution with frequency; in
some cases these parameters increase and in other cases they decrease with
increasing frequency. The evolution with frequency of the polarization
properties of the profile is also non-trivial. We provide evidence that the
pre- and post-cursors generally have higher fractional linear polarization than
the main pulse. We have obtained the spectral index and rotation measure for
each pulsar by fitting across all three observing bands. For the majority of
pulsars, the spectra follow a single power-law and the position angles follow a
$\lambda^2$ relation, as expected. However, clear deviations are seen for some
pulsars. We also present phase-resolved measurements of the spectral index,
fractional linear polarization and rotation measure. All these properties are
shown to vary systematically over the pulse profile.

dynamics of a host-parasitoid system. Recent work has introduced a
semi-discrete framework for obtaining model update functions that connect
host-parasitoid population levels from year-to-year. In particular, this
framework uses differential equations to describe the hosts-parasitoid
interaction during the time of year where they come in contact, allowing
specific behaviors to be mechanistically incorporated into the model. We use
the semi-discrete approach to study the effects of host-feeding, which occurs
when a parasitoid consumes a potential host larva without ovipositing. Our
results show that host-feeding by itself cannot stabilize the system, and both
the host and parasitoid populations exhibit diverging oscillations similar to
the Nicholson-Bailey model. However, when combined with other stabilizing
mechanisms such as density-dependent host mortality or density-dependent
parasitoid attack rate, host-feeding expands the region of parameter space that
allows for a stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. Finally, our results show that
host-feeding causes inefficiency in the parasitoid population, which yields a
higher population of hosts per generation. This suggests that host-feeding may
have limited long-term impact in terms of suppressing host levels for
biological control applications.

number density reduces the noise in the weak lensing mass maps, and thus
increases the signal-to-noise ratio of peaks of the lensing signal due to
massive clusters. This enables us to construct a weak lensing selected cluster
sample by adopting a high threshold S/N, such that the contamination rate due
to false signals is small. We find 6 peaks with S/N>5. For all the peaks,
previously identified clusters of galaxies are matched within a separation of 1

welfare function of utilities whose gradient gives the choice probability
vector, we propose a new representation of discrete choice model which we call
the welfare-based choice model. The welfare-based choice model is meaningful on
its own by providing a new way of constructing choice models. More importantly,
it provides great analysis convenience for establishing connections among
existing choice models. We prove by using convex analysis theory, that the
welfare-based choice model is equivalent to the representative agent choice
model and the semi-parametric choice model, establishing the equivalence of the
latter two. We show that these three models are all strictly more general than
the random utility model, while when there are only two alternatives, those
four models are equivalent. In particular, we show that the distinction between
the welfare-based choice model and the random utility model lies in the
requirement of the higher-order derivatives of the welfare function. We then
define a new concept in choice models: substitutability/complementarity between
alternatives. We show that the random utility model only allows
substitutability between different alternatives; while the welfare-based choice
model allows flexible substitutability/complementarity patterns. We argue that
such flexibility could be desirable in capturing certain practical choice
patterns and expanding the scope of discrete choice models. Examples are given

physics and chemistry. Conceptually, CDWs have their origin rooted in the
instability of a one-dimensional system described by Peierls. The extension of
this concept to reduced dimensional systems has led to the concept of Fermi
surface nesting (FSN), which dictates the wave vector q_cdw of the CDW and the
corresponding lattice distortion. The idea is that segments of the Fermi
contours are connected by q_cdw, resulting in the effective screening of
phonons inducing Kohn Anomalies in their dispersion at q_cdw, driving a lattice
restructuring at low temperatures. There is growing theoretical and
experimental evidence that this picture fails in many real systems and in fact
it is the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix
element that determines the characteristic of CDW phase (q_cdw). Here, based on
the published results for the prototypical CDW system 2H-NbSe2, we show how
well the q-dependent EPC matrix element, but not the FSN, can describe the
origin of CDW. We further demonstrate a procedure of combing electronic band
and phonon (dispersion and linewidth) measurements to extract the EPC matrix
element, allowing the electronic states involved in the EPC to be identified.
Thus we show that a large EPC does not necessarily induce the CDW phase, with
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212) as the example, and the charge ordered phenomena
observed in various cuprates are not driven by FSN or EPC. To experimentally
resolve the microscopic picture of EPC will lead to a fundamental change in the
way we think about, write about, and classify Charge Density Waves.

indicates the insensitivity of the oscillator system's period to temperature

the influence of protein dimerization and cooperative stability in protein

cooperative stability means that high-order oligomers are more stable than
their monomeric counterparts. The period of an oscillator is affected by the
parameters of the dynamic system, which in turn are influenced by temperature.
We adopted the Repressilator and the Atkinson oscillator to analyze the
temperature sensitivity of their periods. Phase sensitivity analysis was
employed to evaluate the period variations of different models induced by
perturbations to the parameters. Furthermore, we used experimental data
provided by other studies to determine the reasonable range of parameter
temperature sensitivity. We then applied the linear programming method to the
oscillatory systems to analyze the effects of protein dimerization and
cooperative stability on the temperature sensitivity of their periods, which
reflects the ability of temperature compensation in circadian rhythms. Our
study explains the temperature compensation mechanism for circadian clocks.
Compared with the no-dimer mathematical model and linear model for protein
degradation, our theoretical results show that the nonlinear protein
degradation caused by cooperative stability is more beneficial for realizing

its mathematically equivalent CGLS applied to normal equations system, are
commonly used for large-scale discrete ill-posed problems. It is well known
that LSQR and CGLS have regularizing effects, where the number of iterations
plays the role of the regularization parameter. However, it has long been
unknown whether the regularizing effects are good enough to find best possible
regularized solutions. Here a best possible regularized solution means that it
is at least as accurate as the best regularized solution obtained by the
truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) method. In this paper, we
establish bounds for the distance between the $k$-dimensional Krylov subspace
and the $k$-dimensional dominant right singular space. They show that the
Krylov subspace captures the dominant right singular space better for severely
and moderately ill-posed problems than for mildly ill-posed problems. Our
general conclusions are that LSQR has better regularizing effects for the first
two kinds of problems than for the third kind, and a hybrid LSQR with
additional regularization is generally needed for mildly ill-posed problems.
Exploiting the established bounds, we derive an estimate for the accuracy of
the rank $k$ approximation generated by Lanczos bidiagonalization. Numerical
experiments illustrate that the regularizing effects of LSQR are good enough to
compute best possible regularized solutions for severely and moderately
ill-posed problems, stronger than our theory predicts, but they are not for
mildly ill-posed problems and additional regularization is needed.

background subtraction from compressive measurements (BSCM) is becoming an
active research task in video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel
tensor-based robust PCA (TenRPCA) approach for BSCM by decomposing video frames
into backgrounds with spatial-temporal correlations and foregrounds with
spatio-temporal continuity in a tensor framework. In this approach, we use 3D
total variation (TV) to enhance the spatio-temporal continuity of foregrounds,
and Tucker decomposition to model the spatio-temporal correlations of video
background. Based on this idea, we design a basic tensor RPCA model over the
video frames, dubbed as the holistic TenRPCA model (H-TenRPCA). To characterize
the correlations among the groups of similar 3D patches of video background, we
further design a patch-group-based tensor RPCA model (PG-TenRPCA) by joint
tensor Tucker decompositions of 3D patch groups for modeling the video
background. Efficient algorithms using alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) are developed to solve the proposed models. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world videos demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed approaches over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

that obfuscates the anomalies. To do this, we first develop a highly accurate
fingerprinting mechanism that combines multiple motion sensors and makes use of
(inaudible) audio stimulation to improve detection. We then collect
measurements from a large collection of smartphones and evaluate the impact of
calibration and obfuscation techniques on the classifier accuracy.

studied in the Thomas Fermi approximation. The evolution of the overdensity of
the collapsed region and its expansion rate are calculated for two scenarios.
We consider the case of a sharp phase transition (which happens when the
critical temperature is reached) from the normal dark matter state to the
condensate one and the case of a smooth first order phase transition where
there is a continuous conversion of ""normal"" dark matter to the BEC phase. We
present numerical results for the physics of the collapse for a wide range of
the model's space parameter, i.e. the mass of the scalar particle $m_{\chi}$
and the scattering length $l_s$. We show the dependence of the transition
redshift on $m_{\chi}$ and $l_s$. Since small scales collapse earlier and
eventually before the BEC phase transition the evolution of collapsing halos in
this limit is indeed the same in both the CDM and the BEC models. Differences
are expected to appear only on the largest astrophysical scales. However, we
argue that the BEC model is almost indistinguishable from the usual dark matter
scenario concerning the evolution of nonlinear perturbations above typical
clusters scales, i.e., $\gtrsim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$. This provides an analytical
confirmation for recent results from cosmological numerical simulations [H.-Y.

rapidly. In this work we make a thorough study of the life-cycle of papers in

a few years after its publication, reaches a peak and then decreases rapidly.
This decay can be described by an exponential or a power law behavior, as in
ultradiffusive processes, with exponential fitting better than power law for
the majority of cases. The decay is also becoming faster over the years,
signaling that nowadays papers are forgotten more quickly. However, when time

similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show
that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared,
and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find
that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies
on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected
by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally
non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure.
Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure
their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the
dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that
depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability
of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series,
and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a
more broad context.

whether or not winter housing is practised that have the most significant
effects on the number of infected cattle, with the effect of winter housing
becoming stronger as farm size increases. Whether badgers were culled or not

regolith slopes and the regolith migration found on the surfaces of asteroids
(Richardson et al. 2004; Miyamoto et al. 2007). Here, we use a continuum
mechanics method to simulate the seismic wave propagation in an asteroid.
Assuming that asteroids can be described by a cohesive core surrounded by a
thin non-cohesive regolith layer, our numerical simulations of vibrations
induced by micro-meteoroids suggest that the surface peak ground accelerations
induced by micro-meteoroid impacts may have been previously under-estimated.
Our lower bound estimate of vertical accelerations induced by seismic waves is
about 50 times larger than previous estimates. It suggests that impact events
triggering seismic activity are more frequent than previously assumed for
asteroids in the kilometric and sub-kilometric size range. The regolith lofting
is also estimated by a first order ballistic approximation. Vertical
displacements are small, but lofting times are long compared to the duration of
the seismic signals. The regolith movement has a non-linear dependence on the
distance to the impact source which is induced by the type of seismic wave
generating the first movement. The implications of regolith concentration in
lows of surface acceleration potential are also discussed. We suggest that the
resulting surface thermal inertia variations of small fast rotators may induce
an increased sensitivity of these objects to the Yarkovsky effect.

  Parameters Using Incremental Automatic Relevance Determination","This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal

relevance determination (IARD) algorithm in the context of multipath parameter
estimation in a super-resolution regime. The corresponding estimation problem
is highly nonlinear and, in general, requires an estimation of the number of
multipath components. In the IARD approach individual multipath components are
processed sequentially, which permits a tractable convergence analysis of the
corresponding inference expressions. This leads to a simple condition, termed
here a pruning condition, that determines if a multipath component is
""sparsified"" or retained in the model, thus permitting a fast and adaptive
realization of the estimation algorithm. Yet previous experiments demonstrated
that IARD fails to select the correct number of components when the parameters
entering nonlinearly the multipath model are also estimated. To understand this
effect, an analysis of the statistical structure of the pruning condition is
proposed. It is shown that the corresponding test statistic in the pruning
condition follows an extreme value distribution. As a result, the standard IARD
algorithm implements a statistical test with a very high probability of false
alarm. This leads to insertion of estimation artifacts and underestimation of
signal sparsity. Moreover, the probability of false alarm worsens as the number
of measured signal samples grows. Based on the developed statistical
interpretation of the IARD, an optimal adjustment of the pruning condition is
proposed. This permits a reliable and efficient removal of estimation artifacts
and joint estimation of signal parameters, as well as optimal model order
selection within a sparse Bayesian learning framework.

is also a dynamic transition---the immortality transition---when the

  We assume a standard predictive model inspired by collaborative filtering, in

balance between recursion and dynamic programming to compute this policy. We
further propose and analyze two heuristic policies: a `farsighted' greedy

  Solution of Automata","39 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a solution of automata similar to Population Protocols and
Network Constructors. The automata (or nodes) move passively in a well-mixed
solution and can cooperate by interacting in pairs. Every such interaction may
result in an update of the local states of the nodes. Additionally, the nodes
may also choose to connect to each other in order to start forming some
required structure. We may think of such nodes as the smallest possible
programmable pieces of matter. The model that we introduce here is a more
applied version of Network Constructors, imposing physical (or geometrical)
constraints on the connections. Each node can connect to other nodes only via a
very limited number of local ports, therefore at any given time it has only a
bounded number of neighbors. Connections are always made at unit distance and
are perpendicular to connections of neighboring ports. We show that this
restricted model is still capable of forming very practical 2D or 3D shapes. We
provide direct constructors for some basic shape construction problems. We then
develop new techniques for determining the constructive capabilities of our
model. One of the main novelties of our approach, concerns our attempt to
overcome the inability of such systems to detect termination. In particular, we
exploit the assumptions that the system is well-mixed and has a unique leader,
in order to give terminating protocols that are correct with high probability
(w.h.p.). This allows us to develop terminating subroutines that can be
sequentially composed to form larger modular protocols. One of our main results
is a terminating protocol counting the size $n$ of the system w.h.p.. We then
use this protocol as a subroutine in order to develop our universal
constructors, establishing that the nodes can self-organize w.h.p. into
arbitrarily complex shapes while still detecting termination of the
construction.

a determinate and orchestrated procedure that often incorporates stochastic
mechanisms in order to diversify cell types. How these stochastic phenomena
interact to govern cell fate are poorly understood. Nonetheless, cell fate
decision making procedure is mainly regulated through the activation of
differentiation waves and associated signaling pathways. In the current work,
we focus on the Notch/Delta signaling pathway which is not only known to
trigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral
inhibition, i.e. a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling
between neighboring cells. Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic
decisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, e.g.~as ones found in the
regulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations,
attributed to micro-environmental factors. However, the effect of intrinsic and
extrinsic noise on cell fate determination is an open problem. Our goal is to
elucidate how the induction of extrinsic noise affects cell fate specification
in a lateral inhibition mechanism. Using a stochastic Cellular Automaton with
continuous state space, we show that extrinsic noise results in the emergence
of steady-state furrow patterns of cells in a ""frustrated/transient"" phenotypic

proposed that affords a fast and continuous obstacle image-map estimation from
a single video stream captured onboard a USV. The model accounts for the
semantic structure of marine environment as observed from USV by imposing weak
structural constraints. A Markov random field framework is adopted and a highly
efficient algorithm for simultaneous optimization of model parameters and
segmentation mask estimation is derived. Our approach does not require
computationally intensive extraction of texture features and comfortably runs
in real-time. The algorithm is tested on a new, challenging, dataset for

Decomposition (SVD), which makes essential use of the fact that, the SVD
subspace preserves significant amount of information of an image and is a one
way decomposition. The principal components are used, along with the
corresponding singular vectors of the watermark image to watermark the target
image. For further security, the semi-blind scheme is extended to an invisible
hash based watermarking scheme. The hash based scheme commits a watermark with
a key such that, it is incoherent with the actual watermark, and can only be
extracted using the key. Its security is analyzed in the random oracle model
and shown to be unforgeable, invisible and satisfying the property of
non-repudiation.

content of the Galactic halo by microlensing experiments in the direction of
the Large Magellanic Cloud. This has been prompted by recent measurements of
the Galactic rotation curve, which suggest that the limits have been biassed by
the assumption of an over-massive halo. The paper first discusses the security
of the detection efficiency calculations which are central to deriving the
MACHO content of the Galactic halo. It then sets out to compare the rotation
curves from various halo models with recent observations, with a view to
establishing what limits can be put on an all-MACHO halo. The main thrust of
the paper is to investigate whether lighter halo models which are consistent
with microlensing by an all-MACHO halo are also consistent with recent measures
of the Galactic rotation curve. In this case the population of bodies
discovered by the MACHO collaboration would make up the entire dark matter
content of the Galactic halo. The main result of this paper is that it is easy
to find low mass halo models consistent with the observed Galactic rotation
curve, which also imply an optical depth to microlensing similar to that found
by the MACHO collaboration. This means that all-MACHO halos cannot be ruled out
on the basis of their observations. In conclusion, limits placed on the MACHO
content of the Galactic halo from microlensing surveys in the Magellanic Clouds
are inconsistent and model dependent, and do not provide a secure basis for
rejecting an all-MACHO halo.

the exchange $sd$-coupling. For both bulk and quasi-two-dimensional systems we
find that, by varying the system parameters within realistic ranges, both

in both types of systems is the appearance of strong oscillations where the
exchange $sd$-coupling by itself only causes an exponential decay of the mean
electronic spin components. The mean-field approximation is also studied and it
is interpreted analytically why it shows a strong suppression of the

achieved in the probe transmission based on a hybrid setup, which is composed
of an optical cavity with two charged nano mechanical resonators (MRs). The two
MRs are electrostatically coupled via tunable Coulomb coupling strength

$g_{c}$ that couples the two MRs can be switched on and off by controlling the
bias voltages on the MRs, and acts as a tunable switch that allows the
propagation of transmitted probe field as slow light ($g_{c} \neq 0$) or fast
light ($g_{c} = 0$). In our scheme, the magnitude of delay and pulse
advancement can be controlled by tuning the Coulomb interaction and power of

been of great interest. To provide insight from a different perspective and
gain a unified phase transition picture, non-extended phase space
thermodynamics of $(n+1)$-dimensional charged topological Lovelock AdS black
holes is investigated detailedly in the grand canonical ensemble. Specifically,
the specific heat at constant electric potential is calculated and phase
transition in the grand canonical ensemble is discussed. To probe the impact of
the various parameters, we utilize the control variate method and solve the
phase transition condition equation numerically for the case $k=1,-1$. There
are two critical points for the case $n=6,k=1$ while there is only one for
other cases. For $k=0$, there exists no phase transition point. To figure out
the nature of phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble, we carry out an
analytic check of the analog form of Ehrenfest equations proposed by Banerjee
et al. It is shown that Lovelock AdS black holes in the grand canonical
ensemble undergo a second order phase transition. To examine the phase
structure in the grand canonical ensemble, we utilize the thermodynamic
geometry method and calculate both the Weinhold metric and Ruppeiner metric. It
is shown that for both analytic and graphical results that the divergence
structure of the Ruppeiner scalar curvature coincides with that of the specific
heat. Our research provides one more example that Ruppeiner metric serves as a
wonderful tool to probe the phase structures of black holes.

suspected northern hemisphere prograde jet, locating its peak near 58 N, and
extended wind speed measurements to 73 N. For 28 cloud features we obtained
extremely high wind-speed accuracy through extended tracking times. The new
results confirm a small N-S asymmetry in the zonal wind profile, and the lack
of any change in the southern hemisphere between 1986 (near solstice) and 2007
(near equinox) suggests that the asymmetry may be permanent rather than
seasonally reversing. In the 2007 images we found two prominent groups of
discrete cloud features with very long lifetimes. The one near 30 S has
departed from its previous oscillatory motion and started a significant
northward drift, accompanied by substantial morphological changes. The complex
of features near 30 N remained at a nearly fixed latitude, while exhibiting
some characteristics of a dark spot accompanied by bright companion features.
Smaller and less stable features were used to track cloud motions at other
latitudes, some of which lasted over many planet rotations, though many could
not be tracked beyond a single transit. A bright band has developed near 45 N,
while the bright band near 45 S has begun to decline, both events in agreement
with the idea that the asymmetric band structure of Uranus is a delayed
response to solar forcing, but with a surprisingly short delay of only a few

extensivity breaks down. From experimental examples we induce two general
hypothesis concerning such systems. In the first the existence of an internal
coordinate system in which extensivity works is assumed. The second hypothesis
concerns the link between this internal coordinate system and the usual
thermodynamic variables. This link is represented by an extra relation between
two variables pertaining to the two descriptions; to be illustrative a scaling
law has been introduced relating external and internal volumes. In addition, we
use an axiomatic description based on the approach of the second law of
thermodynamics proposed by E. Lieb and J. Yngvason (Physics Reports 310,
1999,1). We show that it exists an entropy function satisfying the monotony of
the usual thermodynamic entropy. If a state results from the association of
different states, the entropy is additive under these states. However, the
entropy is a non-extensive function and we give its law of transformation under
a change of the external volume. The entropy is based on some reference states,
a change of these states leads to an affine transformation of the entropy. To
conclude we can say that the main aspect of the second law of thermodynamics
survives in the case of non-extensive systems.

characterized using diffraction and inelastic scattering of synchrotron

crystal can be described by a regular twinning of an average P6$_3$ structure
with three disordered positions of the Cr ions. Short-range correlations of the
occupational disorder result in a quite intense and structured diffuse
scattering; a static nature of the disorder was unambiguously attributed by the
inelastic x-ray scattering. The diffuse scattering has been modeled using a
reverse Monte-Carlo algorithm assuming a disorder of the Cr sub-lattice only.
The observed correlated disorder of the Cr sub-lattice reduces the temperature
of the magnetic ordering from 130 K to 88 K and drastically modifies the field
dependence of the magnetization as it is evidenced by the SQUID magnetometery.

monitoring, the null hypothesis may be rejected after only one or two adverse
events are observed. In this paper, we explore continuous sequential monitoring
when we do not allow the null to be rejected until a minimum number of observed
events have occurred. We also evaluate continuous sequential analysis with a
delayed start until a certain sample size has been attained. Tables with exact
critical values, statistical power and the average times to signal are
provided. We show that, with the first option, it is possible to both increase
the power and reduce the expected time to signal, while keeping the alpha level
the same. The second option is only useful if the start of the surveillance is
delayed for logistical reasons, when there is a group of data available at the
first analysis, followed by continuous or near-continuous monitoring
thereafter.

spin-dependent transport contributions within and in between the constituents.
Separation of these local and non-local contributions is essential to obtain
microscopic understanding and for potential applications of the underlying

rotation and ellipticity in the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) we observe a
time-dependent magnetization profile M(z,t) in Co/Cu(001) films by exploiting
the effective depth sensitivity of the method. By analyzing the spatio-temporal

spin-dependent transport effects, while after hot electron thermalization (>200

(dL) that is entirely based on uniform substitution, a proof rule that
substitutes a formula for a predicate symbol everywhere. Uniform substitutions
make it possible to rely on axioms rather than axiom schemata, substantially
simplifying implementations. Instead of nontrivial schema variables and
soundness-critical side conditions on the occurrence patterns of variables, the
resulting calculus adopts only a finite number of ordinary dL formulas as
axioms. The static semantics of differential dynamic logic is captured
exclusively in uniform substitutions and bound variable renamings as opposed to
being spread in delicate ways across the prover implementation. In addition to
sound uniform substitutions, this paper introduces differential forms for
differential dynamic logic that make it possible to internalize differential
invariants, differential substitutions, and derivations as first-class axioms

noncontextual definite values to all (of a finite set of) quantum mechanical
observables in a consistent manner. If one assumes that any definite values
behave noncontextually, one can nonetheless only conclude that some observables
(in this set) are value indefinite.
  In this paper we prove a variant of the Kochen-Specker theorem showing that,
under the same assumption of noncontextuality, if a single one-dimensional
projection observable is assigned the definite value 1, then no one-dimensional
projection observable that is incompatible (i.e., non-commuting) with this one
can be assigned consistently a definite value. Unlike standard proofs of the
Kochen-Specker theorem, in order to localise and show the extent of value
indefiniteness this result requires a constructive method of reduction between
Kochen-Specker sets.
  If a system is prepared in a pure state $|\psi\rangle$, then it is reasonable
to assume that any value assignment (i.e., hidden variable model) for this
system assigns the value 1 to the observable projecting onto the
one-dimensional linear subspace spanned by $|\psi\rangle$, and the value 0 to
those projecting onto linear subspaces orthogonal to it. Our result can be
interpreted, under this assumption, as showing that the outcome of a
measurement of any other incompatible one-dimensional projection observable
cannot be determined in advance, thus formalising a notion of quantum
randomness.

heterodyne down-conversion. Finally, the generated intermediate frequency
signals are amplified by cryogenic and room-temperature HEMT amplifiers and
exported to the telescope's back end for further processing and, finally,

the relativistically induced modulation of an underlying carrier wave that
moves with the velocity of the particle. In the rest frame of the particle this
underlying structure has the form of a standing wave. De Broglie also assumed
the existence of this antecedent standing wave, but it would appear that he
failed to notice its survival as a carrier wave in the Lorentz transformed wave
structure. Identified as a modulation, the de Broglie wave acquires a
physically reasonable ontology, evidencing a more natural unity between matter
and radiation than might otherwise be contemplated, and avoiding the necessity
of recovering the particle velocity from a superposition of such waves. Because
the Schr\""{o}dinger and other wave equations for massive particles were
conceived as equations for the de Broglie wave, this interpretation of the wave
is also relevant to such issues in quantum mechanics as the meaning of the wave
function, the nature of wave-particle duality, and the possibility of

assist for genomic attribute extracting or describing biologically meaningful
features embedded in a DNA. The codongrams and a2grams are offered as an
alternative to spectrograms and scalograms. Twenty different a^2grams are
defined for a genome, one for each amino acid (valgram is an a^2gram for
valine; alagram is an a^2gram for alanine and so on). They provide information
about the distribution and occurrence of the investigated amino acid. In
particular, the metgram can be used to find out potential start position of
genes within a genome. This approach can help implementing a new diagnosis test
for genetic diseases by providing a type of DNA-medical imaging.

known, the DNA mapping into proteins remains as one of the relevant discoveries
of genetics. However, modern genomic signal processing usually requires
converting symbolic-DNA strings into complex-valued signals in order to take
full advantage of a broad variety of digital processing techniques. The genetic
code is revisited in this paper, addressing alternative representations for it,
which can be worthy for genomic signal processing. Three original
representations are discussed. The inner-to-outer map builds on the unbalanced
role of nucleotides of a 'codon' and it seems to be suitable for handling
information-theory-based matter. The two-dimensional-Gray map representation is
offered as a mathematically structured map that can help interpreting
spectrograms or scalograms. Finally, the world-map representation for the
genetic code is investigated, which can particularly be valuable for
educational purposes -besides furnishing plenty of room for application of
distance-based algorithms.

matching-pennies game that modifies the collected payoffs. In a spatial version
players are distributed on a square lattice and interact with their neighbors.
Firstly, we show that the matching-pennies game can be considered as the
microscopic force of the Red Queen effect that breaks the detailed balance and
induces eddies in the microscopic probability currents if the strategy update
is analogous to the Glauber dynamics for the kinetic Ising models. The
resulting loops in probability current breaks symmetry between the
chessboard-like arrangements of strategies via a bottleneck effect occurring
along the four-edge loops in the microscopic states. The impact of this
congestion is analogous to the application of a staggered magnetic field in the
Ising model, that is, the order-disorder critical transition is wiped out by
noise. It is illustrated that the congestion induced symmetry breaking can be
beneficial for the whole community within a certain region of parameters.

equation for the (2+1)D Dirac Hamiltonian are presented. Both utilize a
single-cone staggered space-time grid which ensures a single-cone energy
dispersion to formulate a numerical treatment of the mixed-state dynamics
within the von Neumann equation. The first scheme executes the time-derivative
according to the product rule for ""bra"" and ""ket"" indices of the density
operator. It therefore directly inherits all the favorable properties of the
difference scheme for the pure-state Dirac equation and conserves positivity.
The second scheme proposed here performs the time-derivative in one sweep. This
direct scheme is investigated regarding stability and convergence. Both schemes
are tested numerically for elementary simulations using parameters which
pertain to topological insulator surface states. Application of the schemes to
a Dirac Lindblad equation and real-space-time Green's function formulations are
discussed.

statistical concepts, for pattern matching purposes in time series. The
technique analytically quantifies the extent of similitude between a known
signal within a group of data, by means of a single parameter. Specifically,
the method was applied to voice recognition problem, by selecting samples from
a given individual recordings of the 5 vowels, in Spanish. The frequency of
acquisition of the data was 11.250 Hz. A certain distinctive interval was
established from each vowel time series as a representative test function and
it was compared both to itself and to the rest of the vowels by means of an
algorithm, for a subsequent graphic illustration of the results.
  We conclude that for a minimum distinctive length, the method meets
resemblance between every vowel with itself, and also an irrefutable difference
with the rest of the vowels for an estimate length of 30 points (~2 10-3 s).

detection is covered. Classical and current filtering methods for manoeuvre
tracking are presented including multi-level process noise, input estimation,
variable dimension filtering, two-stage filter, the interacting multiple model
algorithm, and generalised pseudo-Bayesian algorithms. Various extensions of
these algorithms to the case of cluttered measurements are also described and
these include: joint manoeuvre and measurement association, probabilistic data
association and multi-hypothesis tracking. Smoothing schemes, including IMM
smoothing and batch expectation-maximisation using the Viterbi algorithm, are
also described. The use of amplitude information for target measurement
discrimination is discussed. It is noted that although many manoeuvre tacking
techniques exist, the literature contains surprisingly few performance
comparisons to guide the design engineer although a performance benchmark has
recently been introduced.

adiabatic and anisotropic source in $5D$ Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity. To this
end, the source has been taken as Tolman-Bondi model which preserve
inhomogeneity in nature. The field equations, Misner-Sharp mass and dynamical
equations have formulated in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $5D$. The
junction conditions have been explored between the anisotropic source and
vacuum solution in Gauss-Bonnet gravity in detail. The Misner and Sharp
approach has been applied to define the proper time and radial derivatives.
Further, these helps to formulate general dynamical equations. The equations
show that the mass of the collapsing system increases with the same amount as
the effective radial pressure increases. The dynamical system preserve
retardation which implies that system under-consideration goes to gravitational
collapse.
