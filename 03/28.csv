that the process is weakly non-ergodic in the sense that the time averaged MSD

We demonstrate for fermions that the Green function factorizes when the system

neighbors interactions the Green function factorizes at every link connecting
two sites with the same occupation. As a consequence we show that the
conductance distribution function for interacting systems is log-normal, in the

SCN's users are divided into two types: frequent users, who are regular users
of certain small cells, and occasional users, who are one-time or infrequent
users of a particular small cell. Given such \emph{context} information, each
small cell base station (SCBS) aims to maximize the overall performance
provided to its frequent users, while ensuring that occasional users are also
well serviced. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game in which the
SCBSs are the players. The strategy of each SCBS is to choose a proper power
allocation so as to optimize a utility function that captures the tradeoff
between the users' quality-of-service gains and the costs in terms of resource
expenditures. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and
uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game, and we show that
this condition is independent of the number of users in the network. Simulation
results show that the proposed context-aware resource allocation game yields
significant performance gains, in terms of the average utility per SCBS,
compared to conventional techniques such as proportional fair allocation and
sum-rate maximization.

sensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we introduce BASTA
(BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a new approach implemented in
BEAST2 that combines the accuracy of methods based on the structured coalescent
with the computational efficiency required to handle more than just few
populations. We illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model
choice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic transmission
of Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent analysis correctly infers
that successive human Ebola outbreaks have been seeded by a large unsampled
non-human reservoir population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly
concludes that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus to
persist over the past four decades. As genomics takes on an increasingly
prominent role informing the control and prevention of infectious diseases, it
will be vital that phylogeographic inference provides robust insights into
transmission history.

of a pure-loss bosonic channel for such a task, where $\eta$ is the average

The purpose of the present paper is to extend these results beyond the

multipartite generalizations of the squashed entanglement to constrain the

We first establish, as expected, that the plasma is screening if there are no
short nontrivial paths around the torus. We also find that when one of the
handles has a short circumference -- i.e. the thin-torus limit -- the plasma no
longer screens. To quantify this we compute the normalization of the Laughlin
state, both numerically and analytically. For the numerical calculation we
expand the Laughlin state in a Fock basis of slater-determinants of single
particle orbitals, and determine the Fock coefficients of the expansion as a
function of torus geometry. In the thin torus limit only a few Fock
configurations have non-zero coefficients, and their analytical forms simplify
greatly. Using this simple limit, we can reconstruct the normalization and
analytically extend it back into the 2D regime. We find that there are geometry
dependent corrections to the normalization, and this in turn implies that the
plasma in the plasma analogy is not screening when in the thin torus limit.
Further we obtain an approximate normalization factor that gives a good
description of the normalization for all tori, by extrapolating the thin torus
normalization to the thick torus limit.

extragalactic H II regions provide an independent method for determining the
primordial helium abundance, Y_p. Traditionally, the emission lines employed
are in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is
limited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in
helium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical
parameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, & Guseva
(2014) have pioneered adding the He 10830 infrared emission line in helium
abundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He 10830
makes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the
degeneracy with temperature. We revisit our analysis of the dataset published
by Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007) and incorporate the newly available
observations of He 10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoretical
Paschen-gamma ratio. The solutions are better constrained, in particular for
electron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the
model fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for
quality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut.
Furthermore, the addition of He 10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium
abundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from
10-80%. Overall, we find a reduction in the uncertainty on Y_p by over 50%.
From a regression to zero metallicity, we determine Y_p = 0.2449 +/- 0.0040,
consistent with the BBN result, Y_p = 0.2470 +/- 0.0002, based on the Planck
determination of the baryon density. The dramatic improvement in the
uncertainty from incorporating He 10830 strongly supports the case for
simultaneous (thus not requiring scaling) observations of visible and infrared
helium emission line spectra.

with optical time series, we find that the planet presents a transmission
spectrum indistinguishable from a horizontal line. In emission, WASP-80b is the
intrinsically faintest planet whose dayside flux has been detected in both the
3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m Spitzer channels. The depths of the occultations reveal that
WASP-80b is as bright and as red as a T4 dwarf, but that its temperature is
cooler. If planets go through the equivalent of an L-T transition, our results
would imply this happens at cooler temperatures than for brown dwarfs. Placing
WASP-80b's dayside into a colour-magnitude diagram, it falls exactly at the
junction between a blackbody model and the T-dwarf sequence; we cannot discern
which of those two interpretations is the more likely. Flux measurements on
other planets with similar equilibrium temperatures are required to establish
whether irradiated gas giants, like brown dwarfs, transition between two
spectral classes. An eventual detection of methane absorption in transmission
would also help lift that degeneracy.
  We obtained a second series of high-resolution spectra during transit, using
HARPS. We reanalyse the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The data now favour an
aligned orbital solution and a stellar rotation nearly three times slower than
stellar line broadening implies. A contribution to stellar line broadening,
maybe macroturbulence, is likely to have been underestimated for cool stars,
whose rotations have therefore been systematically overestimated. [abridged]

patients privacy, promoting clinician acceptance and prescription security when
compared with the customary paper method. Traditionally, medical prescriptions
are typically handwritten or printed on paper and hand-delivered to
pharmacists. Paper-based medical prescriptions are generating major concerns as
the incidences of prescription errors have been increasing and causing minor to
serious problems to patients, including deaths. In this paper, intelligent
eprescription model that comprises a knowledge base of drug details and an
inference engine that can help in decision making when writing a prescription
was developed. The research implements the e-prescription model with
multifactor authentication techniques which comprises password and biometric
technology. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, using C-Sharp programming language,
and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database were employed in developing the systems
front end and back end respectively. This work implements a knowledge base to
the e-prescription system which has added intelligence for validating doctors
prescription and also added security feature to the e-prescription system.

metallicities are assumed. The adopted distance moduli, for both the GCs and
Carina, are based on our ZAHB models, which are able to reproduce the old HB
component (as well as the luminosity of the HB clump) of the dwarf spheroidal
galaxy quite well --- even if it spans a range in [Fe/H] of ~ 1.5 dex, provided
that [alpha/Fe] varies with [Fe/H] in approximately the way that has been
derived spectroscopically. Ages derived here agree reasonably well with those
found previously for the old and intermediate-age turnoff stars, as well as for
the period of negligible star formation (SF) activity (~ 6-10 Gyr ago). CMD
simulations have been carried out for the faintest turnoff and subgiant stars.
They indicate a clear preference for SF that lasted several Gyr instead of a
short burst, with some indication that ages decrease with increasing [Fe/H]. In
general, stellar models that assume spectroscopic metallicities provide
satisfactory fits to the observations, including the thin giant branch of
Carina, though higher oxygen abundances than those implied by the adopted
values of [alpha/Fe] would have favorable consequences.

Locally, the dynamics is driven by a canonical model for the evolution of the
population density, consisting of a logistic expression plus multiplicative
noises. Spatial coupling is introduced by means of two spreading mechanisms:
diffusive dispersion and selective migration driven by patch suitability. We
focus on the long-time population size as a function of habitat configurations,
environment fluctuations and coupling schemes. We obtain the conditions, that
the spatial distribution of favorable patches and the coupling mechanisms must
fulfill, to grant population survival. The fundamental phenomenon that we
observe is the positive feedback between environment fluctuations and spatial

of the signal to noise ratio is the main argument of this chapter. The third
chapter shows simulations of possible spectra of the comet's nucleus, which are
useful for both a comparison with real spectra, and for a planning of the
observations. Hapke's radiative transfer model is used to invert acquired data
to infer physical properties. The fourth chapter introduces a method for
spectral modeling. It includes the information on the instrumental noise,
permitting the analysis of the goodness of the models, and an estimation of the
error of the retrieved parameters. The fifth chapter presents the spectral
analysis of Tempel 1 and Hartley 2 whose data are coming from Deep Impact space

divergence form are investigated. Conditions are established for nonnegative
directional splittings to hold in a neighborhood of an arbitrary interior
point. The result is used to construct monotone finite difference schemes for
the boundary value problem of anisotropic diffusion operators. It is shown that
such a monotone scheme can be constructed if the underlying diffusion matrix is
continuous on the closure of the physical domain and symmetric and uniformly
positive definite on the domain, the mesh spacing is sufficiently small, and
the size of finite difference stencil is sufficiently large. An upper bound for
the stencil size is obtained, which is determined completely by the diffusion
matrix. Loosely speaking, the more anisotropic the diffusion matrix is, the
larger stencil is required. An exception is the situation with a strictly
diagonally dominant diffusion matrix where a three-by-three stencil is
sufficient for the construction of a monotone finite difference scheme.
Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.

contributions to thermal conductivity, which is termed Green-Kubo modal
analysis (GKMA). The GKMA method combines the lattice dynamics formalism with
the Green-Kubo formula for thermal conductivity, such that the thermal
conductivity becomes a direct summation of modal contributions, where one need
not define the phonon velocity. As a result the GKMA method can be applied to
any material/group of atoms where the atoms vibrate around stable equilibrium
positions, which includes not only crystalline line compounds, but also random
alloys, amorphous materials and even molecules. The GKMA method provides new
insight into the nature of phonon transport, as it casts the problem in terms
of mode-mode correlation instead of scattering, and provides a general unified

  Antonio, 2015",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this talk, we describe recent experimental progress in detecting the
chiral anomaly in the Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi in the presence of a magnetic
field. The chiral anomaly, which plays a fundamental role in chiral gauge
theories, was predicted to be observable in crystals by Nielsen and Ninomiya in
1983 [1]. Theoretical progress in identifying and investigating Dirac and Weyl
semimetals has revived strong interest in this issue [2-6]. In the Dirac
semimetal, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by a magnetic field $\bf B$
splits each Dirac node into two chiral Weyl nodes. If an electric field $\bf E$
is applied parallel to $\bf B$, charge is predicted to flow between the Weyl
nodes. We report the observation in the Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi of a novel,
negative and highly anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR). We show that the
enhanced conductivity has the form of a narrowly defined plume that can be
steered by the applied field. The novel MR is acutely sensitive to deviations
of $\bf B$ from $\bf E$, a feature incompatible with conventional transport.
The locking of the current plume to the field appears to be a defining
signature of the chiral anomaly.

an - out of equilibrium - hyperpolarized state by microwave saturation of the
electron spins in interaction with them. Here we show that the electron dipolar
interactions compete with the local magnetic fields resulting in two distinct
dynamical phases: for strong interactions the electron spins equilibrate to an
extremely low effective temperature that boosts DNP efficiency. For weak
interaction this spin temperature is not defined and the polarization profile
has an 'hole burning' shape characteristic of the non interacting case. The
study of the many-body eigenstates reveals that these two phases are intimately
related to the problem of thermalization in closed quantum systems where
breaking of ergodicity is expected varying the strength of the interactions.

This unpredictability can be due to a variety of physical mechanisms, but it is
quantified by an entropy rate. This rate describes how quickly a system

experimentally study entropy generation and the emergence of deterministic

particular cases of uni- axial and shear strain were analized. The evolution of
the electron group velocity indicates a break up of the trigonal warping

strained reciprocal lattice. The Fermi velocity becomes strongly anisotropic,
i.e, for a strong pure shear-strain (20% of the lattice parameter), the two
inequivalent Dirac cones merge and the Fermi velocity is zero in one of the

  We show that any scoring function that is consistent for a quantile or an

for the mean value and probability forecasts of binary events constitute
important examples. The quantile and expectile functionals along with the

in terms of thresholds in decision making.
  The Choquet type mixture representations give rise to simple checks of
whether a forecast dominates another in the sense that it is preferable under
any consistent scoring function. In empirical settings it suffices to compare
the average scores for only a finite number of extremal elements. Plots of the

formed at critical potential strengths, which leads to us posit the use of
`optimal traps' to combat the chiral tunneling found in graphene, which could
be explored experimentally with an artificial network of point charges held
above the graphene layer. We also discuss scattering on these states and find
the zero angular momentum states create a dominant peak in scattering
cross-section as energy tends towards the Dirac point energy, suggesting a
dominant contribution to resistivity.

galaxy group NGC~5813, the deepest Chandra observation of a galaxy group to
date. Earlier observations showed two pairs of cavities distributed roughly
collinearly, with each pair associated with an elliptical shock front. The new
observations confirm a third pair of outer cavities, collinear with the other
pairs, and reveal an associated outer outburst shock at ~30 kpc. This system is
therefore unique in exhibiting three cavity pairs, each associated with an
unambiguous AGN outburst shock front. The implied mean kinetic power is roughly
the same for each outburst, demonstrating that the average AGN kinetic
luminosity can remain stable over long timescales (~50 Myr). The two older
outbursts have larger, roughly equal total energies as compared with the
youngest outburst, implying that the youngest outburst is ongoing. We find that
the radiative cooling rate and the mean shock heating rate of the gas are well
balanced at each shock front, suggesting that AGN outburst shock heating alone
is sufficient to offset cooling and establish AGN/ICM feedback within at least
the central 30 kpc. This heating takes place roughly isotropically and most
strongly at small radii, as is required for feedback to operate. We suggest
that shock heating may play a significant role in AGN feedback at smaller radii
in other systems, where weak shocks are more difficult to detect. We find
non-zero shock front widths that are too large to be explained by particle
diffusion. Instead, all measured widths are consistent with shock broadening
due to propagation through a turbulent ICM with a mean turbulent speed of ~70
km/s. Finally, we place lower limits on the temperature of any volume-filling
thermal gas within the cavities that would balance the internal cavity pressure
with the external ICM.

generalized, it may be that a more viable approach to the theory is through
identifying the relevant quantum structures rather than by quantizing classical
spacetime. This viewpoint is supported by difficulties of such quantization,
and by the apparent lack of a fundamental role for locality. In finite or
discrete quantum systems, important structure is provided by tensor
factorizations of the Hilbert space. However, even in local quantum field
theory properties of the generic type III von Neumann algebras and of long
range gauge fields indicate that factorization of the Hilbert space is
problematic. Instead it is better to focus on the structure of the algebra of
observables, and in particular on its subalgebras corresponding to regions.
This paper suggests that study of analogous algebraic structure in gravity
gives an important perspective on the nature of the quantum theory. Significant
departures from the subalgebra structure of local quantum field theory are
found, working in the correspondence limit of long-distances/low-energies.
Particularly, there are obstacles to identifying commuting algebras of
localized operators. In addition to suggesting important properties of the
algebraic structure, this and related observations pose challenges to proposals
of a fundamental role for entanglement.

and weak measurements to condensed matter systems. Here a weak measurement
protocol is proposed for obtaining the $Z_2$ index of a topological insulator.
The setup consists of a topological insulator with a hole pierced by a time
dependent Aharonov-Bohm flux. A certain weak value ($A_{gs}$) associated with
the time-integrated magnetization in the hole has a universal response to a
small ambient magnetic field ($B$), namely $A_{gs}B = 2 \hbar$. This result is
unaffected by disorder, interactions, and, to a large extent, the speed of the
flux threading. It hinges mainly on preventing the flux from leaking outside
the hole, as well as being able to detect magnetization at a resolution of a
few spins. A similar result may be obtained using only charge measurements, in
a setup consisting of a double quantum dot weakly coupled to an LC circuit.
Here one obtains $\langle \phi \rangle_{weak} Q_0 =2\hbar$, where $\langle \phi
\rangle_{weak}$ is a weak value associated with the flux on the inductor and
$Q_0$ is the average capacitor charging. The universality of these results
suggests that they may be used as a testbed for weak values in condensed matter
physics.

of $\rho$, this 1-halo conformity matches corresponding measurements in a group

conformity at large separations from isolated objects, potentially an imprint
of halo assembly bias. A detailed study - using mocks with assembly bias erased

however. At separations $\lesssim 4$Mpc, conformity is mainly a 1-halo effect
dominated by the largest halos and is $\textit{not}$ a robust indicator of
assembly bias. Only at very large separations ($\gtrsim 8$Mpc) does genuine
2-halo conformity, driven by the assembly bias of small halos, manifest
distinctly. We explain all these trends in standard Halo Model terms. Our model

has been corroborated by several groups, including the Fermi collaboration, on
whose data the observation is based. Dark matter annihilation into standard
model particles has been shown to give a good fit to the signal for a variety
of final state particles, but generic models are inconsistent with constraints
from direct detection. Models where the dark matter annihilates to mediators
that subsequently decay are less constrained. We perform global fits of such
models to recent data, allowing branching fractions to all possible fermionic
final states to vary. The best fit models, including constraints from the
AMS-02 experiment (and also antiproton ratio), require branching primarily to
muons, with a $\sim 10-20\%$ admixture of $b$ quarks, and no other species.
This suggests models in which there are two scalar mediators that mix with the
Higgs, and have masses consistent with such a decay pattern. The scalar that
decays to $\mu^+\mu^-$ must therefore be lighter than $2m_\tau \cong 3.6$ GeV.
Such a small mass can cause Sommerfeld enhancement, which is useful to explain
why the best-fit annihilation cross section is larger than the value needed for
a thermal relic density. For light mediator masses $\sim (0.2-2)$ GeV, it can
also naturally lead to elastic DM self-interactions at the right level for

as unreliable. We contaminate the clean base galaxy sample with galaxies with
unreliable redshifts and attempt to recover the contaminating galaxies using
the Elliptical Envelope technique. We then train four machine learning
architectures for redshift analysis on both the contaminated sample and on the
preprocessed 'anomaly-removed' sample and measure redshift statistics on a
clean validation sample generated without any preprocessing. We find an
improvement on all measured statistics of up to 80% when training on the
anomaly removed sample as compared with training on the contaminated sample for
each of the machine learning routines explored. We further describe a method to
estimate the contamination fraction of a base data sample.

estimation, which significantly improves the reconstruction of photometric
redshift probability density functions (PDFs) for individual galaxies and
galaxy samples. As a use case we apply our method to CFHTLS galaxies. The
ordinal classification algorithm treats distinct redshift bins as ordered
values, which improves the quality of photometric redshift PDFs, compared with
non-ordinal classification architectures. We also propose a new single value
point estimate of the galaxy redshift, that can be used to estimate the full
redshift PDF of a galaxy sample. This method is competitive in terms of
accuracy with contemporary algorithms, which stack the full redshift PDFs of
all galaxies in the sample, but requires orders of magnitudes less storage
space.
  The methods described in this paper greatly improve the log-likelihood of
individual object redshift PDFs, when compared with a popular Neural Network
code (ANNz). In our use case, this improvement reaches 50\% for high redshift
objects ($z \geq 0.75$).
  We show that using these more accurate photometric redshift PDFs will lead to
a reduction in the systematic biases by up to a factor of four, when compared
with less accurate PDFs obtained from commonly used methods. The cosmological
analyses we examine and find improvement upon are the following: gravitational
lensing cluster mass estimates, modelling of angular correlation functions, and
modelling of cosmic shear correlation functions.

density of the lightest neutralino easily evades the present direct LHC limits
on sparticle masses and also lies to a large extent beyond future LHC

LHC can probe a broad class of GUT-inspired SUSY models with gaugino
non-universality that are currently in agreement with the bounds from
$\delta(g-2)$, as well as with the relic density and the Higgs mass
measurement. To this end we perform a detailed numerical simulation of several

standard model (SM) particles only through the PW field of ~ MeV -- multi-GeV
mass particles. The interactions occur via an U(1)' mediator, V_{\mu}', which
couples to the SM by kinetic mixing with U(1) hypercharge bosons, B_{\mu}. One
important difference between our model and other such models in the literature
is the absence of an extra singlet scalar, so that the parameter with dimension
of mass M^2_V is not related to a spontaneous symmetry breaking. This QED based
model is also renormalizable. The mass scale of the mediator and the absence of
the singlet scalar can lead to interesting astrophysical signatures. The
dominant annihilation channels are different from those usually considered in
previous work. We show that the GeV-energy gamma-ray excess in the galactic
center region, as derived from Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Space Telescope data, can be
attributed to such secluded dark matter WIMPs, given parameters of the model
that are consistent with the cosmological dark matter density. Secluded WIMP
models are also consistent with suggested upper limits on the DM contribution

recurrence across genes or known pathways. We introduce Combinations of
Mutually Exclusive Alterations (CoMEt), an algorithm to identify combinations
of alterations de novo, without any prior biological knowledge (e.g. pathways
or protein interactions). CoMEt searches for combinations of mutations that
exhibit mutual exclusivity, a pattern expected for mutations in pathways. CoMEt
has several important feature that distinguish it from existing approaches to
analyze mutual exclusivity among alterations. These include: an exact
statistical test for mutual exclusivity that is more sensitive in detecting
combinations containing rare alterations; simultaneous identification of
collections of one or more combinations of mutually exclusive alterations;
simultaneous analysis of subtype-specific mutations; and summarization over an
ensemble of collections of mutually exclusive alterations. These features
enable CoMEt to robustly identify alterations affecting multiple pathways, or
hallmarks of cancer. We show that CoMEt outperforms existing approaches on

we find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster and

differences larger than $10$--$20$\% in both cases. Consistent conclusions are
found with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. These results have
important consequences for the physical process(es) responsible for the size
evolution of galaxies, and in particular the effect of the environment. The
remarkable growth in galaxy size observed from $z\sim2.5$ has been reported to
depend on the environment at higher redshifts ($z>1$), with early-type/passive
galaxies in higher density environments growing earlier. Such dependence
disappears at lower redshifts. Therefore, if the reported difference at
higher-$z$ is real, the growth of field galaxies has caught up with that of
cluster galaxies by $z\sim1$. Any putative mechanism responsible for galaxy

out the evolution in the emissivity at z>~6 from the new Planck optical depth
tau measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectra
and from the prevalence of Ly-alpha emission in z~7-8 galaxies. We find the
redshift evolution in the emissivity dot{N}_{ion}(z) required by the
observations to be d(log Nion)/dz=-0.15(-0.11)(+0.08), largely independent of
the assumed clumping factor C_{HII} and entirely independent of the nature of
the ionising sources. The trend in dot{N}_{ion}(z) is well-matched by the
evolution of the galaxy UV-luminosity density (dlog_{10}
rho_UV/dz=-0.11+/-0.04) to a magnitude limit >~-13 mag, suggesting that
galaxies are the sources that drive the reionization of the universe. The role
of galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the UV luminosity
density rho_UV to dot(N)_{ion}(z) being possible for physically-plausible
values of the escape fraction f_{esc}, the Lyman-continuum photon production
efficiency xi_{ion}, and faint-end cut-off $M_{lim}$ to the luminosity
function. Quasars/AGN appear to match neither the redshift evolution nor
normalization of the ionizing emissivity. Based on the inferred evolution in
the ionizing emissivity, we estimate that the z~10 UV-luminosity density is
8(-4)(+15)x lower than at $z~6, consistent with the observations. The present
approach of contrasting the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity with
that of the galaxy UV luminosity density adds to the growing observational
evidence that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of the
universe.

  Development of ZnO and ZnO-Bi2O3 under Direct Currents","36 pages",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DC flash sintering of both pure and 0.5 mol. % Bi2O3-doped ZnO at a
relatively high activating field of 300 V/cm has been investigated. It is
demonstrated that even high-purity ZnO single crystals can ""flash"" at 870C. In
comparison, flash sintering occurs at a substantially lower onset temperature
of 550C in ZnO powder specimens, indicating the important roles of surfaces
and/or grain boundaries. A model has been developed to forecast the thermal
runaway conditions and the predictions are in excellent agreements with the
observed onset flash temperatures, attesting that the flash starts as a thermal
runaway in at least these ZnO based systems. Interestingly, enhanced grain
growth is observed at the anode side of the pure ZnO specimens with an abrupt
change in the grain sizes, indicating the occurrence of
electric-potential-induced abnormal grain growth. With a large current density,
the growth of aligned hexagonal single-crystalline rods toward the anode
direction is evident in the ZnO powder specimen. Moreover, Bi2O3 doping defers
the onset of flash sintering, which can be explained from the formation of
space charges at grain boundaries, and it homogenizes the microstructure due to
a liquid-phase sintering effect. The key scientific contributions of this study
include the development of a model to predict the thermal runaway conditions
that are coincident with the observed onset flash sintering temperatures, the
clarification of how flash starts in ZnO based specimens, and the observation
and explanation of diversifying phenomena of sintering and microstructural
development under applied electric currents.

two-dimensional fluid flows can be remarkably rich and varied. For
time-invariant flows, the front dynamics may simplify, settling in to a steady
state in which the reacted domain is static, and the front appears ""frozen"".
Our central result is that these frozen fronts in the two-dimensional fluid are
composed of segments of burning invariant manifolds---invariant manifolds of
front-element dynamics in $xy\theta$-space, where $\theta$ is the front
orientation. Burning invariant manifolds (BIMs) have been identified previously
as important local barriers to front propagation in fluid flows. The relevance
of BIMs for frozen fronts rests in their ability, under appropriate conditions,
to form global barriers, separating reacted domains from nonreacted domains for
all time. The second main result of this paper is an understanding of
bifurcations that lead from a nonfrozen state to a frozen state, as well as
bifurcations that change the topological structure of the frozen front. Though
the primary results of this study apply to general fluid flows, our analysis
focuses on a chain of vortices in a channel flow with an imposed wind. For this
system, we present both experimental and numerical studies that support the
theoretical analysis developed here.

  in the Presence of Uncertainty about the Background Population",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A goal in the forensic interpretation of scientific evidence is to make an
inference about the source of a trace of unknown origin. The evidence is
composed of the following three elements: (a) the trace of unknown origin, (b)
a sample from a specific source, and (c) a collection of samples from the
alternative source population. The inference process usually considers two
propositions. The first proposition is usually referred to as the prosecution
hypothesis and states that a given specific source is the actual source of the
trace of unknown origin. The second, usually referred to as the defense
hypothesis, states that the actual source of the trace of unknown origin is
another source from a relevant alternative source population. One approach is
to calculate a Bayes Factor for deciding between the two competing hypotheses.
This approach commonly assumes that the alternative source population is
completely known or uses point estimates for its parameters. Contrary to this
common approach, we propose a development that incorporates the uncertainty on
the alternative source population parameters in a reasonable and coherent
manner into the Bayes Factor. We will illustrate the resulting effects on the
calculation of several Bayes Factors for different situations with a
well-studied collection of samples of glass fragments.

atmosphere) ranges from 20 to 2E6 times larger than the disequilibria of other
atmospheres in the Solar System. Only on Earth is the chemical disequilibrium
energy comparable to the thermal energy per mole of atmosphere. Earth's
disequilibrium is biogenic, mainly caused by the coexistence of N2, O2 and
liquid water instead of more stable nitrate. In comparison, the O2-CH4
disequilibrium is minor. We identify abiotic processes that cause
disequilibrium in the other atmospheres. Our metric requires minimal
assumptions and could potentially be calculated using observations of exoplanet
atmospheres. However, further work is needed to establish whether thermodynamic
disequilibrium is a practical exoplanet biosignature, requiring an assessment
of false positives, noisy observations, and other detection challenges. Our
Matlab code and databases for these calculations are available, open source.

parameter for material design. Since material properties are affected by
temperature, in this article a simple model is proposed to correlate the work
function with temperature, expressed as $\varphi (T)=\varphi_{0} -\gamma
\frac{(k_{B} T)^{2}}{\varphi_{0}} $, where $\gamma $ varies with the crystal

generalize the chromatic number $\chi_1$ of a graph. In any fixed dimension
$d$, the $s$-chromatic number $\chi_s$ of $d$-complexes can become arbitrarily
large for $s\leq\lceil d/2\rceil$ [6,18]. In contrast, $\chi_{d+1}=1$, and only
little is known on $\chi_s$ for $\lceil d/2\rceil<s\leq d$.
  A particular class of $d$-complexes are triangulations of $d$-manifolds. As a
consequence of the Map Color Theorem for surfaces [29], the 2-chromatic number
of any fixed surface is finite. However, by combining results from the
literature, we will see that $\chi_2$ for surfaces becomes arbitrarily large
with growing genus. The proof for this is via Steiner triple systems and is
non-constructive. In particular, up to now, no explicit triangulations of
surfaces with high $\chi_2$ were known.
  We show that orientable surfaces of genus at least 20 and non-orientable
surfaces of genus at least 26 have a 2-chromatic number of at least 4. Via a
projective Steiner triple systems, we construct an explicit triangulation of a
non-orientable surface of genus 2542 and with face vector $f=(127,8001,5334)$

2-chromatic numbers 5 and 6.
  For 3-dimensional manifolds, an iterated moment curve construction [18] along
with embedding results [6] can be used to produce triangulations with
arbitrarily large 2-chromatic number, but of tremendous size. Via a topological
version of the geometric construction of [18], we obtain a rather small
triangulation of the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ with face vector

investigate how p53 dynamics are modulated by PDCD5 during the DNA damage

results reveal that p53 activities can display rich dynamics under different
PDCD5 levels, including monostability, bistability with two stable steady
states, oscillations, and co-existence of a stable steady state and an
oscillatory state. Physical properties of the p53 oscillations are further
shown by the potential landscape, in which the potential force attracts the
system state to the limit cycle attractor, and the curl flux force drives the
coherent oscillation along the cyclic. We also investigate the effect of PDCD5
efficiency on inducing the p53 oscillations. We show that Hopf bifurcation is
induced by increasing the PDCD5 efficiency, and the system dynamics show clear
transition features in both barrier height and energy dissipation when the
efficiency is close to the bifurcation point. This study provides a global
picture of how PDCD5 regulates p53 dynamics via the interaction with the

discussed topics in condensed matter physics. Such interplay gives rise to
magneto-electric coupling, which in the case of solids was named
magneto-electric effect, as predicted by Curie on the basis of symmetry
considerations. This effect enables the manipulation of magnetization using
electrical field or, conversely, the manipulation of electrical polarization by
magnetic field. The latter is known as the magnetocapacitance effect. Here, we
show that non-equilibrium spin accumulation can induce tunnel
magnetocapacitance through the formation of a tiny charge dipole. This dipole
can effectively give rise to an additional serial capacitance, which represents
an extra charging energy that the tunneling electrons would encounter. In the
sequential tunneling regime, this extra energy can be understood as the energy
required for a single spin to flip. A ferromagnetic single-electron-transistor
with tunable magnetic configuration is utilized to demonstrate the proposed
mechanism. It is found that the extra threshold energy is experienced only by
electrons entering the islands, bringing about asymmetry in the measured
Coulomb diamond. This asymmetry is an unambiguous evidence of spin accumulation
induced tunnel magnetocapacitance, and the measured magnetocapacitance value is
as high as 40%.

  structural health monitoring signals","41 pages, 18 figures",,,,"stat.AP stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of compressive sensing (CS) to structural health monitoring
is an emerging research topic. The basic idea in CS is to use a
specially-designed wireless sensor to sample signals that are sparse in some
basis (e.g. wavelet basis) directly in a compressed form, and then to
reconstruct (decompress) these signals accurately using some inversion
algorithm after transmission to a central processing unit. However, most
signals in structural health monitoring are only approximately sparse, i.e.
only a relatively small number of the signal coefficients in some basis are
significant, but the other coefficients are usually not exactly zero. In this
case, perfect reconstruction from compressed measurements is not expected. A
new Bayesian CS algorithm is proposed in which robust treatment of the
uncertain parameters is explored, including integration over the
prediction-error precision parameter to remove it as a ""nuisance"" parameter.
The performance of the new CS algorithm is investigated using compressed data
from accelerometers installed on a space-frame structure and on a cable-stayed
bridge. Compared with other state-of-the-art CS methods including our
previously-published Bayesian method which uses MAP (maximum a posteriori)
estimation of the prediction-error precision parameter, the new algorithm shows
superior performance in reconstruction robustness and posterior uncertainty
quantification. Furthermore, our method can be utilized for recovery of lost
data during wireless transmission, regardless of the level of sparseness in the
signal.

pathway to promote cell apoptosis. Recombinant human PDCD5 can significantly
sensitize different cancers to chemotherapies. In the present paper, we
construct a computational model that includes PDCD5 interactions in the p53
signaling network and study the effects of PDCD5 on p53-mediated cell fate
decisions during the DNA damage response. Our results revealed that PDCD5
functions as a co-activator of p53 that regulates p53-dependent cell fate
decisions via the mediation of p53 dynamics. The effects of PDCD5 are
dose-dependent such that p53 can display either sustained or pulsed dynamics at
different PDCD5 levels. Moreover, PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two
mechanisms during the two phases of sustained and pulsed p53 dynamics. This
study provides insights regarding how PDCD5 functions as a regulator of the p53
pathway and might be helpful for increasing our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms by which PDCD5 can be used to treat cancers.

show that in Higgs-portal type models, for DM particles with $s$-wave

insulating and shows strong ferromagnetism. This distinctive behavior would
make it a promising candidate as a magnetoelectric multiferroic if it was also
a polar material, but experiments have shown that bulk BiMnO$_3$ has either a
very small polarization (below 0.1~$\mu$C/cm$^2$) or, most likely, that it is a
paraelectric. There is also experimental evidence that the polarization in
BiMnO$_3$ {\em films} grown on SrTiO$_3$ can be as high as 20~$\mu$C/cm$^2$.
Despite of the interest of these behaviors, the diagram of BiMnO$_3$ as a
function of epitaxial strain has remained largely unexplored. In this article,
we use first-principles to predict that both under enough compressive and
tensile epitaxial strain BiMnO$_3$ films are ferroelectric with a giant
polarization around 100~$\mu$C/cm$^2$. The phases displayed by the films are
similar to those experimentally found for BiFeO$_3$ in similar conditions---at
compressive strains, the film is supertetragonal with a large component of the
polarization pointing out of plane, while at tensile strains the polarization
points mostly in plane. Like in BiFeO$_3$ films, these phases are

explore an alternative approach, based on a new algorithm variant specifically

have been performed, using both parallel and sequential implementations of the

geometry/physics/kinematics for this subclass compared to the radio-quiet (RQ)
majority of quasars. We discuss how this restricted domain for the LD RL parent
population supports the notion for a RQ-RL dichotomy among Type 1 sources. 3C
57 is an atypical RL quasar that shows both uncertain radio morphology and
falls in a region of 4DE1 space where RL quasars are rare.
  We present new radio flux and optical spectroscopic measures designed to
verify its atypical optical/UV spectroscopic behaviour and clarify its radio
structure. The former data confirms that 3C 57 falls off the 4DE1 quasar ""main
sequence"" with both extreme optical FeII emission (R_{FeII} ~ 1) and a large
CIV 1549 profile blueshift (~ -1500 km/s). These parameter values are typical
of extreme Population A sources which are almost always RQ. New radio measures
show no evidence for flux change over a 50+ year timescale consistent with
compact steep-spectrum (CSS or young LD) over core-dominated morphology. In the
4DE1 context where LD RL are usually low L/L_{Edd} quasars we suggest that 3C
57 is an evolved RL quasar (i.e. large Black Hole mass) undergoing a major
accretion event leading to a rejuvenation reflected by strong FeII emission,
perhaps indicating significant heavy metal enrichment, high bolometric
luminosity for a low redshift source and resultant unusually high Eddington
ratio giving rise to the atypical CIV 1549.

constrain the evolutionary processes in galaxies. This requires the knowledge
of the average yield per stellar generation, $y_{\text{Z}}$, i.e. the quantity
of metals that a stellar population releases into the interstellar medium
(ISM), which is generally assumed to be a fixed fiducial value. Deviations of
the observed metallicity from the expected value of $y_{\text{Z}}$ are used to
quantify the effect of outflows or inflows of gas, or even as evidence for
biased metallicity calibrations or inaccurate metallicity diagnostics. Here we
show that $\rm y_{\text{Z}}$ depends significantly on the Initial Mass Function
(IMF), varying by up to a factor larger than three, for the range of IMFs
typically adopted in various studies. Varying the upper mass cutoff of the IMF
implies a further variation of $y_{\text{Z}}$ by an additional factor that can
be larger than two. These effects, along with the variation of the gas mass
fraction restored into the ISM by supernovae ($R$, which also depends on the
IMF), may yield to deceiving results, if not properly taken into account. In
particular, metallicities that are often considered unusually high can actually
be explained in terms of yield associated with commonly adopted IMFs such as
the Kroupa (2001) or Chabrier (2003). We provide our results for two different
sets of stellar yields (both affected by specific limitations) finding that the
uncertainty introduced by this assumption can be as large as $\sim0.2$ dex.
Finally, we show that $y_{\text{Z}}$ is not substantially affected by the
initial stellar metallicity as long as $\text{Z}> 10^{-3}~\text{Z}_{\odot}$.

by families of solitary waves that show a continuous variation in the angular
momentum, and provide a bridge between different winding numbers. We show that
the size of hysteresis loops is determined by the range of existence within the
weak link region of solitary waves which configure the energy barrier
preventing phase slips. The barrier vanishes when the critical rotation leads
winding numbers and solitonic states to a matching configuration. At this
point, Landau and Feynman criteria for phase slips meet: the fluid flow reaches
the local speed of sound, and stationary vortex lines (which are the building
blocks of solitons) can be excited inside the system.

However, these facilities are usually large and costly. Here, we propose a

pulse off-axially injected in a straight channel, the centroid oscillation of
the pulse causes a wiggler motion of the whole accelerating structure including

step-size when dealing with smooth strongly convex functions. Empirically, we
demonstrate improvements over existing stochastic Quasi-Newton and variance
reduced stochastic gradient methods.

This formalism was developed by Alonzo Church as a tool for studying the
mathematical properties of effectively computable functions. The formalism
became popular and has provided a strong theoretical foundation for the family
of functional programming languages. This tutorial shows how to perform
arithmetical and logical computations using the $\lambda$-calculus and how to
define recursive functions, even though $\lambda$-calculus functions are
unnamed and thus cannot refer explicitly to themselves.

isosceles trapezoid with two equal masses $m_1=m_4$ at positions $(\mp 0.5,
r_B)$ and $m_2=m_3$ at positions $(\mp \alpha/2, r_A)$. We derive, both
analytically and numerically, regions of central configurations in the phase
space where it is possible to choose positive masses. It is also shown that in
the compliment of these regions no central configurations are possible.

with positive cosmological constant ($\Lambda$), modelled in terms of a
Newtonian and collisionless fluid, particle trajectories are analytical in time
(representable by a convergent Taylor series) until at least a finite time
after decoupling. The time variable used for this statement is the cosmic scale
factor, i.e., the ""$a$-time"", and not the cosmic time. For this, a
Lagrangian-coordinates formulation of the Euler-Poisson equations is employed,
originally used by Cauchy for 3-D incompressible flow. Temporal analyticity for
$\Lambda$CDM is found to be a consequence of novel explicit all-order recursion
relations for the $a$-time Taylor coefficients of the Lagrangian displacement
field, from which we derive the convergence of the $a$-time Taylor series. A
lower bound for the $a$-time where analyticity is guaranteed and shell-crossing
is ruled out is obtained, whose value depends only on $\Lambda$ and on the
initial spatial smoothness of the density field. The largest time interval is
achieved when $\Lambda$ vanishes, i.e., for an Einstein-de Sitter universe.
Analyticity holds also if, instead of the $a$-time, one uses the linear
structure growth $D$-time, but no simple recursion relations are then obtained.
The analyticity result also holds when a curvature term is included in the
Friedmann equation for the background, but inclusion of a radiation term
arising from the primordial era spoils analyticity.

"1504.00213","Jose G. Vargas","Jose G. Vargas","Total Operators and Inhomogeneous Proper Values Equations","A number of typos have been corrected",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kaehler's two-sided angular momentum operator, K + 1, is neither
vector-valued nor bivector-valued. It is total in the sense that it involves
terms for all three dimensions. Constant idempotents that are ""proper
functions"" of K+1's components are not proper functions of K+1. They rather
satisfy ""inhomogeneous proper-value equations"", i.e. of the form (K + 1)U =
{\mu}U + {\pi}, where {\pi} is a scalar. We consider an equation of that type
with K+1 replaced with operators T that comprise K + 1 as a factor, but also
containing factors for both space and spacetime translations. We study the
action of those T's on linear combinations of constant idempotents, so that
only the algebraic (spin) part of K +1 has to be considered. {\pi} is now, in
general, a non-scalar member of a Kaehler algebra. We develop the system of
equations to be satisfied by the combinations of those idempotents for which
{\pi} becomes a scalar. We solve for its solutions with {\mu} = 0, which
actually also makes {\pi} = 0: The solutions with {\mu} = {\pi} = 0 all have
three constituent parts, 36 of them being different in the ensemble of all such
solutions. That set of different constituents is structured in such a way that
we might as well be speaking of an algebraic representation of quarks. In this
paper, however, we refrain from pursuing this identification in order to
emphasize the purely mathematical nature of the argument.

not every object is assessed by every assessor. A problem facing such panels is
how to take into account different standards amongst panel members and varying
levels of confidence in their scores. Here, a mathematically-based algorithm is
developed to calibrate the scores of such assessors, addressing both of these
issues. The algorithm is based on the connectivity of the graph of assessors
and objects evaluated, incorporating declared confidences as weights on its
edges. If the graph is sufficiently well connected, relative standards can be
inferred by comparing how assessors rate objects they assess in common,
weighted by the levels of confidence of each assessment. By removing these
biases, ""true"" values are inferred for all the objects. Reliability estimates
for the resulting values are obtained. The algorithm is tested in two case
studies, one by computer simulation and another based on realistic evaluation
data. The process is compared to the simple averaging procedure in widespread
use, and to Fisher's additive incomplete block analysis. It is anticipated that
the algorithm will prove useful in a wide variety of situations such as
evaluation of the quality of research submitted to national assessment
exercises; appraisal of grant proposals submitted to funding panels; ranking of
job applicants; and judgement of performances on degree courses wherein
candidates can choose from lists of options.
