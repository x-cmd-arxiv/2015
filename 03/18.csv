contribute to gluon Green's functions in the Landau gauge display infrared
divergences, akin to those one would encounter in a conventional perturbative
treatment. This is in sharp contrast with gluon loops, in which the
perturbative divergences are tamed by the dynamical generation of a gluon mass
acting as an effective infrared cutoff. In this paper, after reviewing the full
nonperturbative origin of this divergence in the two-gluon sector, we discuss
its implications for the three- and four-gluon sector, showing in particular
that some of the form factors characterizing the corresponding Green's
functions are bound to diverge in the infrared.

pathfinder activities for the future International Axion Observatory (IAXO).
The use of low background techniques and the application of discrimination
algorithms based on the high granularity of the readout have led to background
levels below 10$^{-6}$ counts/keV/cm$^2$/s, more than a factor 100 lower than
the first generation of Micromegas detectors. The best levels achieved at the
Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) are as low as 10$^{-7}$

the background level. Finally, we will describe the R&D paths to achieve
sub-keV energy thresholds, which could broaden the physics case of axion

colors. Though, in the many applications of Graph Motif, the input graph
originates from real-life and has structure. Motivated by this prosaic

quantifying the embodiment's effect on the agent's behaviour is beneficial to
the fields of artificial life and artificial intelligence. The contribution of
an agent's body and environment to its behaviour is also known as morphological

the sensorimotor loop into shared, unique and synergistic information. In
numerical simulation based on a formal representation of the sensorimotor loop,
we show that the unique information of the body and environment is a good
measure for morphological computation. The results are compared to our
previously derived quantification of morphological computation.

compact galaxies in SDSS, as targets for more detailed follow-up observations.
  Methods. From the virial theorem it is expected that for a given mass,
compact galaxies have stellar velocity dispersion higher than the mean due to
their smaller sizes. Therefore velocity dispersion coupled with size (or mass)
is an appropriate method to select relics, independent of the stellar
population properties. Based on these consideration we design a set of criteria
using distribution of early-type galaxies from SDSS on the
log$_{10}$(R$_{0}$)-log$_{10}$($\sigma_{0}$) plane to find the most extreme
objects on it.
  Results. We find 76 galaxies at 0.05 < z < 0.2, which have properties similar
to the typical quiescent galaxies at high redshift. We study how well these
galaxies fit on well-known local universe relations of early-type galaxies such
as the fundamental plane, the red sequence or mass-size relations. As expected
from the selection criteria, the candidates are located in an extreme corner of
mass-size plane. However, they do not extend as deeply into the so-called zone
of exclusion as some of the high-redshift compact galaxies ('red nuggets')
found at high redshift, being a factor 2-3 less massive at a given intrinsic
scale size. Our candidates are systematically offset from scaling relations of
average early-type galaxies, while being in the mass-size range expected for
passive evolution of the red nuggets from their high redshift to the present.
  Conclusions. The 76 selected candidates form a well suited set of objects for
further follow-up observations. We argue that selecting a high velocity
dispersion is the best way to find analogues of compact high redshift galaxies
in the local universe.

origin of the observed emission. We report imaging, spectral, and timing
analysis of data from 74 months of observations of the Galactic centre by

Compton scattering by high-energy electrons. In this a model, the GeV bump in
the spectrum originates from an episode of injection of high-energy particles,
which happened ~300 years ago. This injection episode coincides with the known
activity episode of the Galactic centre region, previously identified using

compatible with the data if bremsstrahlung emission from high-energy electrons

values of multiplicative functions in short intervals, combined with an
argument of Katai and Bourgain-Sarnak-Ziegler, we establish an averaged version
of this conjecture, namely $$\sum_{h_1,\dots,h_k \leq H} \left|\sum_{1 \leq n

$X \to \infty$ uniformly for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, with $H$ as before.
Our arguments in fact give quantitative bounds on the decay rate (roughly on
the order of $\frac{\log\log H}{\log H}$), and extend to more general bounded
multiplicative functions than the Liouville function, yielding an averaged form
of a (corrected) conjecture of Elliott.

develop a new methodology to provide a test for detecting a change in the mean
function of the corresponding data. To obtain the test statistic we provide an
alternative estimator of the covariance kernel. The proposed estimator is
asymptotically unbiased under the null hypothesis and, at the same time, has
smaller amount of bias than that of the existing estimator. We show here that
under the null hypothesis the proposed test statistic is pivotal
asymptotically. Moreover, it is shown that under alternative hypothesis the
test is consistent for large enough sample size. It is also found that the
proposed test is more powerful than the available test procedure in the
literature. From the extensive simulation studies we observe that the proposed
test outperforms the existing one with a wide margin in power for moderate
sample size. The developed methodology performs satisfactorily for the average
daily temperature of central England and monthly global average anomaly of
temperatures.

simulation of complex stochastic dynamics. Such problems are typically plagued
with incomplete information that may enter as uncertainty in the model
parameters, or even in the model itself. Furthermore, due to their dynamic
nature, we need to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the transient
and long-time behavior of the stochastic models and derive corresponding
uncertainty bounds for observables of interest. A special class of such
challenges is parametric uncertainties in the model and in particular
sensitivity analysis along with the corresponding sensitivity bounds for
stochastic dynamics. Moreover, sensitivity analysis can be further complicated
in models with a high number of parameters that render straightforward
approaches, such as gradient methods, impractical. In this paper, we derive
uncertainty and sensitivity bounds for path-space observables of stochastic
dynamics in terms of new goal-oriented divergences; the latter incorporate both
observables and information theory objects such as the relative entropy rate.
These bounds are tight, depend on the variance of the particular observable and
are computable through Monte Carlo simulation. In the case of sensitivity
analysis, the derived sensitivity bounds rely on the path Fisher Information
Matrix, hence they depend only on local dynamics and are gradient-free. These
features allow for computationally efficient implementation in systems with a
high number of parameters, e.g., complex reaction networks and molecular
simulations.

is aimed at providing seamless computing/data access to the edge of the network

Different from the traditional cloud, a mobile micro-cloud is smaller and
deployed closer to users, typically attached to a cellular basestation or
wireless network access point. Due to the relatively small coverage area of
each basestation or access point, when a user moves across areas covered by
different basestations or access points which are attached to different
micro-clouds, issues of service performance and service migration become
important. In this paper, we consider such migration issues. We model the
general problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and show that, in the
special case where the mobile user follows a one-dimensional asymmetric random
walk mobility model, the optimal policy for service migration is a threshold
policy. We obtain the analytical solution for the cost resulting from arbitrary
thresholds, and then propose an algorithm for finding the optimal thresholds.
The proposed algorithm is more efficient than standard mechanisms for solving

Dey and Edward Waymire","On Normalized Multiplicative Cascades under Strong Disorder","11 pages, 1 figure, submitted",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiplicative cascades, under weak or strong disorder, refer to sequences of
positive random measures $\mu_{n,\beta}, n = 1,2,\dots$, parameterized by a
positive disorder parameter $\beta$, and defined on the Borel $\sigma$-field
${\mathcal B}$ of $\partial T = \{0,1,\dots b-1\}^\infty$ for the product
topology. The normalized cascade is defined by the corresponding sequence of
random probability measures $prob_{n,\beta}:= Z_{n,\beta}^{-1}\mu_{n,\beta}, n
= 1,2\dots,$ normalized to a probability by the partition function
$Z_{n,\beta}$. In this note, a recent result of Madaule (2011) is used to
explicitly construct a family of tree indexed probability measures
$prob_{\infty,\beta}$ for strong disorder parameters $\beta > \beta_c$, almost
surely defined on a common probability space. Moreover, viewing
$\{prob_{n,\beta}: \beta > \beta_c\}_{n=1}^\infty$ as a sequence of probability
measure valued stochastic process leads to finite dimensional weak convergence
in distribution to a probability measure valued process $\{prob_{\infty,\beta}:
\beta > \beta_c\}$. The limit process is constructed from the tree-indexed
random field of derivative martingales, and the Brunet-Derrida-Madaule
decorated Poisson process. A number of corollaries are provided to illustrate
the utility of this construction.

excitations, whose appearance is caused by intersite atomic interactions

collective excitations should not be confused with lattice vibrations produced
by an external force. No such a force is assumed. But the considered phonons
are purely self-organized collective excitations, characterizing atomic
oscillations around lattice sites, due to intersite atomic interactions. It is
shown that these excitations can essentially influence the possibility of atoms
to be localized. The states that would be insulating in the absence of phonon
excitations can become delocalized when these excitations are taken into
account. This concerns long-range as well as local atomic interactions. To
characterize the region of stability, the Lindemann criterion is used.

selected final state forces gluon radiation to be soft or collinear. Such
radiation factorizes at the level of scattering amplitudes, and this leads to
the resummation of threshold logarithms which appear at leading power in the
threshold variable. In this paper, we consider the extension of this
factorization to include effects suppressed by a single power of the threshold
variable. Building upon the Low-Burnett-Kroll-Del Duca (LBKD) theorem, we
propose a decomposition of radiative amplitudes into universal building blocks,
which contain all effects ultimately responsible for next-to-leading power
(NLP) threshold logarithms in hadronic cross sections for electroweak
annihilation processes. In particular, we provide a NLO evaluation of the
""radiative jet function"", responsible for the interference of next-to-soft and
collinear effects in these cross sections. As a test, using our expression for
the amplitude, we reproduce all abelian-like NLP threshold logarithms in the
NNLO Drell-Yan cross section, including the interplay of real and virtual
emissions. Our results are a significant step towards developing a generally
applicable resummation formalism for NLP threshold effects, and illustrate the
breakdown of next-to-soft theorems for gauge theory amplitudes at loop level.

merger. We find these galaxies are very gas rich, with H2 masses between 4x10^8
and 2x10^10 Msun. We use these molecular gas masses, combined with atomic gas
masses from an accompanying paper, to calculate gas-to-dust and gas-to-stellar
mass ratios. The gas-to-dust ratios of our sample objects vary widely (between
~50 and 750), suggesting many objects have low gas-phase metallicities, and
thus that the gas has been accreted through a recent merger with a lower mass
companion. We calculate the implied minor companion masses and gas fractions,
finding a median predicted stellar mass ratio of ~40:1. The minor companion
likely had masses between ~10^7 - 10^10 Msun. The implied merger mass ratios
are consistent with the expectation for low redshift gas-rich mergers from
simulations. We then go on to present evidence that (no matter which
star-formation rate indicator is used) our sample objects have very low
star-formation efficiencies (star-formation rate per unit gas mass), lower even
than the early-type galaxies from ATLAS3D which already show a suppression.
This suggests that minor mergers can actually suppress star-formation activity.
We discuss mechanisms that could cause such a suppression, include dynamical
effects induced by the minor merger.

different categories, such as incorporating new features, improving software,

difficult and crucial task. Managers must be aware of every aspect of the
development process for managing the software-related issues. Issue Tracking
Systems (ITS) play a central role in supporting the management of release
trajectory. These systems, which support reporting and tracking issues of
different kinds (such as ""bug"", ""feature"", ""improvement"", etc.), record rich
data about the software development process. Yet, recorded historical data in
ITS are still not well-modeled for supporting practical needs of release
trajectory management.
  In this paper, we describe a sequence analysis approach for modeling and
analyzing releases' trajectories, using the tracking process of reported
issues. Release trajectory analysis is based on the categories of tracked
issues and their temporal changing, and aims to address important questions
regarding the co-habitation of unresolved issues, the transitions between
different statuses in release trajectory, the recurrent patterns of release
trajectories, and the properties of a release trajectory.

measured using the parallax of pulsation technique. The different versions of
this technique combine measurements of the linear diameter variation (from
spectroscopy) and the angular diameter variation (from photometry or
interferometry) amplitudes, to retrieve the distance in a quasi-geometrical
way. However, the linear diameter amplitude is directly proportional to the
projection factor (hereafter p-factor), which is used to convert spectroscopic
radial velocities (i.e., disk integrated) into pulsating (i.e., photospheric)
velocities. The value of the p-factor and its possible dependence on the
pulsation period are still widely debated. Our goal is to measure an
observational value of the p-factor of the type-II Cepheid kappa Pavonis, whose
parallax was measured with an accuracy of 5% using HST/FGS. We used this
parallax as a starting point to derive the p-factor of kappa Pav, using the
SPIPS technique, which is a robust version of the parallax-of-pulsation method
that employs radial velocity, interferometric and photometric data. We applied
this technique to a combination of new VLTI/PIONIER optical interferometric
angular diameters, new CORALIE and HARPS radial velocities, as well as
multi-colour photometry and radial velocities from the literature. We obtain a
value of p = 1.26 +/- 0.07 for the p-factor of kappa Pav. This result agrees
with several of the recently derived Period-p-factor relationships from the
literature, as well as previous observational determinations for Cepheids.
Individual estimates of the p-factor are fundamental to calibrating the
parallax of pulsation distances of Cepheids. Together with previous
observational estimates, the projection factor we obtain points to a weak
dependence of the p-factor on period.

present paper, by employing Regge phenomenology, we first express the mass of
the ground state ($L$=0) doubly charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{*+}$ as a function
of masses of the well established light baryons and singly charmed baryons.
Inserting the recent experimental data, the mass of $\Omega_{cc}^{*+}$ is given
to be 3809$\pm$36 MeV, which is independent of any unobservable parameters.
Then, with the quadratic mass relations, we calculate the masses of the ground
state triply charmed baryon $\Omega_{ccc}^{++}$ and doubly charmed baryons
$\Xi_{cc}^{(*)++}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(*)+}$, and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ (the mass of
$\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ is determined as 3520$^{+41}_{-40}$ MeV, which agrees with the
mass of $\Xi_{cc}^{+}(3520)$). The isospin splitting $M_{\Xi_{cc}^{++}} -
M_{\Xi_{cc}^{+}} = 0.4 \pm 0.3$ MeV. After that, masses of the orbitally
excited ($L$=1,2,3) doubly and triply charmed baryons are estimated. The
results are reasonable comparing with those extracted in many other approaches.
We suggest more efforts to study doubly and triply charmed baryons both
theoretically and experimentally, not only for the abundance of baryon spectra,

the discovery of unobserved doubly and triply charmed baryon states and the

more massive in the past in order survive its perigalacticon passage. In
addition the large confining pressure of the hot corona allows gas that was
originally at the outskirts to begin forming stars, initially forming stars of
low metallicity compared to the dwarf evolved in isolation. This increase in
star formation eventually allows a dwarf galaxy to form more metal rich stars
compared to one in isolation, but only if the dwarf retains gas for a
sufficiently long period of time. In addition, dwarfs which formed substantial
numbers of stars post-infall will have a slightly elevated [Mg/Fe] at high

understanding the relative importance of galaxy interactions and secular
evolution during the assembly of galaxies. The kinematic properties of galaxies
as traced by emission lines have been used to suggest the existence of a
significant population of high-z star-forming galaxies consistent with isolated
rotating disks. However, recent studies have cautioned that post-coalescence
mergers may also display disk-like kinematics. To further investigate the
robustness of merger/disk classifications based on kinematic properties, we
carry out a systematic classification of 24 local (U)LIRGs spanning a range of
galaxy morphologies: from isolated spiral galaxies, ongoing interacting
systems, to fully merged remnants. We artificially redshift the WiFeS
observations of these local (U)LIRGs to z=1.5 to make a realistic comparison
with observations at high-z, and also to ensure that all galaxies have the same
spatial sampling of ~900 pc. Using both kinemetry-based and visual
classifications, we find that the reliability of kinematic classification shows
a strong trend with the interaction stage of galaxies. Mergers with two nuclei
and tidal tails have the most distinct kinematic properties compared to
isolated disks, whereas a significant population of the interacting disks and
merger remnants are indistinguishable from isolated disks. The high fraction of
late-stage mergers showing disk-like kinematics reflects the complexity of the
dynamics during galaxy interactions. However, the exact fractions of
misidentified disks and mergers depend on the definition of kinematic

instead the universe slowly sloughs off crunching patches of space that never

significant proportion of patches exit inflation in the unstable vacuum, and as

the launch of Fermi several methods were developed to search for blazars as
potential counterparts of unidentified gamma-ray sources (UGSs). To confirm the

necessary. In 2013 we started a spectroscopic campaign to investigate gamma-ray
blazar candidates selected according to different procedures. The main goals of

possible determine their redshifts. Optical spectroscopic observations will
also permit us to verify the robustness of the proposed associations and check
for the presence of possible source class contaminants to our counterpart

recently been found to dramatically disagree with the predictions of the
standard CV formation model. The high mean WD mass among CVs is not imprinted
in the currently observed sample of CV progenitors and cannot be attributed to
selection effects. Two possibilities have been put forward: either the WD grows
in mass during CV evolution, or in a significant fraction of cases, CV
formation is preceded by a (short) phase of thermal time-scale mass transfer
(TTMT) in which the WD gains a sufficient amount of mass. We investigate if
either of these two scenarios can bring theoretical predictions and
observations into agreement. We employed binary population synthesis models to
simulate the present intrinsic CV population. We incorporated aspects specific
to CV evolution such as an appropriate mass-radius relation of the donor star
and a more detailed prescription for the critical mass ratio for dynamically
unstable mass transfer. We also implemented a previously suggested wind from
the surface of the WD during TTMT and tested the idea of WD mass growth during
the CV phase by arbitrarily changing the accretion efficiency. We compare the
model predictions with the characteristics of CVs derived from observed
samples. We find that mass growth of the WDs in CVs fails to reproduce the
observed WD mass distribution. In the case of TTMT, we are able to produce a
large number of massive WDs if we assume significant mass loss from the surface
of the WD during the TTMT phase. However, the model still produces too many CVs
with helium WDs. Moreover, the donor stars are evolved in many of these
post-TTMT CVs, which contradicts the observations. We conclude that in our
current framework of CV evolution neither TTMT nor WD mass growth can fully
explain either the observed WD mass or the period distribution in CVs.

a binary frequency that decreases towards the core, while the binary frequency
for stars of similar mass in NGC 1805 is flat with radius, or perhaps bimodal
(with a peak in the core). We show here, through detailed N-body modeling, that
both clusters could have formed with the same primordial binary frequency and
with binary orbital elements and masses drawn from the same distributions
(defined from observations of open clusters and the field of our Galaxy). The
observed radial trends in binary frequency for both clusters are best matched
with models that have initial substructure. Furthermore, both clusters may be
evolving along a very similar dynamical sequence, with the key difference that
NGC 1805 is dynamically older than NGC 1818. The F-type binaries in NGC 1818
still show evidence of an initial period of rapid dynamical disruptions (which
occur preferentially in the core), while NGC 1805 has already begun to recover
a higher core binary frequency, owing to mass segregation (which will
eventually produce a distribution in binary frequency that rises only towards
the core, as is observed in old Milky Way star clusters). This recovery rate
increases for higher-mass binaries, and therefore even at one age in one
cluster, we predict a similar dynamical sequence in the radial distribution of
the binary frequency as a function of binary primary mass.

we investigate quantum anomaly effects in quantum phase transitions between

directly related with the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition : anomalies are
conserved in renormalization group flow. By applying the matching condition, we
show massless excitations are enforced by the anomalies in a whole phase
diagram in sharp contrast to the case of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory
which only has massive excitations in symmetric phases. Furthermore, we find
non-perturbative criteria to characterize quantum phase transitions between

theories, CP(1) and the NLSM with WZW, describe different universality class.
Physical realizations and experimental implication of the anomalies are also

among the best understood samples of galaxies, and they are employed in a broad
range of cosmological studies. Because they form a relatively homogeneous
population, with high stellar masses and red colors, they are expected to
occupy halos in a relatively simple way. In this paper, we study how LRGs
occupy massive halos via direct counts in clusters and we reveal several
unexpected trends suggesting that the connection between LRGs and dark matter
halos may not be straightforward. Using the redMaPPer cluster catalog, we
derive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness, Ncen({\lambda}).
Assuming no correlation between cluster mass and central galaxy luminosity at
fixed richness, we show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of
central LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function. At halo
masses of 10^14.5 Msun, we find Ncen=0.73, compared to Ncen of 0.89 from
correlation studies. Our central occupation function for LRGs converges to 0.95
at large halo masses. A strong anti-correlation between central luminosity and
cluster mass at fixed richness is required to reconcile our results with those
based on clustering studies. We also derive P_BNC, the probability that the
brightest cluster member is not the central galaxy. We find P_BNC ~ 20-30%
which is a factor of ~2 lower than the value found by Skibba et al. 2011.
Finally, we study the radial offsets of bright non-central LRGs from cluster
centers and show that bright non-central LRGs follow a different radial
distribution compared to red cluster members, which follow a
Navarro-Frank-White profile. This work demonstrates that even the most massive
clusters do not always have an LRG at the center, and that the brightest galaxy
in a cluster is not always the central galaxy.

parameter space allowed by LAE Ly$\alpha$ and UV luminosity functions (LFs)
alone. With this work, we simultaneously constrain the escape fraction of
ionizing photons $f_{esc}=0.05-0.5$, the mean fraction of neutral hydrogen in
the intergalactic medium (IGM) $\langle \chi_{HI} \rangle \leq 0.01$ and the
dust-dependent ratio of the escape fractions of Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum

largest impact on the amplitude of the ACFs, and its imprints are clearly
distinguishable from those of $f_{esc}$ and $f_\alpha/f_c$. We also show that
galaxies with a critical stellar mass of $M_* = 10^{8.5} (10^{9.5})M_{\odot}$
produce enough luminosity to stay visible as LBGs (LAEs). Finally, the fraction
of time during the past 100 Myrs prior to z=6.6 a galaxy spends as a LBG or as
a LBG with Ly$\alpha$ emission increases with the UV magnitude (and the stellar
mass $M_*$): considering observed (dust and IGM attenuated) luminosities, the

complex number for which the interpretation has long been debated. We analyse
the procedure of weak measurement and postselection, and the interpretation of
the associated weak value, using a theory of classical mechanics supplemented
by an epistemic restriction that is known to be operationally equivalent to a
subtheory of quantum mechanics. Both the real and imaginary components of the
weak value appear as phase space displacements in the postselected expectation
values of the measurement device's position and momentum distributions, and we
recover the same displacements as in the quantum case by studying the
corresponding evolution in the classical theory. By using this analogous
classical theory, we gain insight into the appearance of the weak value as a
result of the statistical effects of post selection, and this provides us with
an operational interpretation of the weak value, both its real and imaginary
parts. We find that the imaginary part of the weak value is a measure of how
much postselection biases the mean phase space distribution for a given amount
of measurement disturbance. All such biases proportional to the imaginary part
of the weak value vanish in the limit where disturbance due to measurement goes
to zero. Our analysis also offers intuitive insight into how measurement
disturbance can be minimised and the limits of weak measurement.

\sigma$ relation signals a global change in the nature of AGN feedback. At
black hole masses below $M-\sigma$ feedback is confined to the immediate
vicinity of the hole. At the $M-\sigma$ mass it becomes much more energetic and
widespread, and can drive away much of the bulge gas as a fast molecular
outflow.

small number of planetary mass objects, as wide-orbit companions to young
stars. The formation mechanism of these objects remains uncertain. In this
paper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the
properties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs
around objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like
stars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than
expected from the ${M}_{\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars
with masses $M_*>0.2 {\rm M}_{\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto
these objects are also higher than expected from the $\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.
Moreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown
dwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the
disc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have
larger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent
star during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they
accrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc
and how they interact with it. Observations of disc masses and accretion rates
onto very low-mass objects are consistent with the predictions of the disc
fragmentation model. Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and
accretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young
planets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations
predicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the
corresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the

rotate around one-dimensional phase singularities. Recent theoretical work
predicts that these filaments drift along step-like height variations. Here we
test this prediction using experiments with thin layers of the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. We observe that over short distances scroll
waves are attracted towards the step and then rapidly commence a steady drift
along the step line. The translating filaments always reside in the shallow
subsystem and terminate on the step plateau near the edge. Accordingly
filaments in the deep subsystem initially collide with and shorten at the step
wall. The drift speeds obey the predicted proportional dependence on the
logarithm of the height ratio and the direction depends on the vortex
chirality. We also observe drift along the perimeter of rectangular plateaus
and find that the filaments perform sharp turns at the corners. In addition, we
investigate rectangular troughs for which vortices of equal chirality can drift
in different directions. The latter two effects are reproduced in numerical
simulations with the Barkley model. The simulations show that narrow troughs
instigate scroll wave encounters that induce repulsive interaction and symmetry
breaking. Similar phenomena could exist in the geometrical complicated
ventricles of the human heart where reentrant vortex waves cause tachycardia

the gauge field breaks the symmetry between left- and right-circularly

used extensively in data analysis especially when the objects being compared

However, we lack common tools needed to actually use information distances in
applications efficiently and at scale with any kind of provable guarantees. We
can't sketch these distances easily, or embed them in better behaved spaces, or
even reduce the dimensionality of the space while maintaining the probability
structure of the data.
  In this paper, we build these tools for information distances---both for the
Hellinger distance and Jensen--Shannon divergence, as well as related measures,
like the $\chi^2$ divergence. We first show that they can be sketched
efficiently (i.e. up to multiplicative error in sublinear space) in the
aggregate streaming model. This result is exponentially stronger than known
upper bounds for sketching these distances in the strict turnstile streaming
model. Second, we show a finite dimensionality embedding result for the
Jensen-Shannon and $\chi^2$ divergences that preserves pair wise distances.
Finally we prove a dimensionality reduction result for the Hellinger,
Jensen--Shannon, and $\chi^2$ divergences that preserves the information
geometry of the distributions (specifically, by retaining the simplex structure
of the space). While our second result above already implies that these
divergences can be explicitly embedded in Euclidean space, retaining the
simplex structure is important because it allows us to continue doing inference
in the reduced space. In essence, we preserve not just the distance structure

Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy (MRS) with submicron probes offers flexibility

characterization of nanoliter droplets and thin films when other methods fall
short. MRS analyzes distinct features of the in-plane rotation of a magnetic
probe, when its magnetic moment makes full revolution following an external
rotating magnetic field. The probe demonstrates a distinguishable movement
which changes from rotation to tumbling to trembling as the frequency of
rotation of the driving magnetic field changes. In practice, MRS has been used
in analysis of gelation of thin polymer films, ceramic precursors, and
nanoliter droplets of insect biofluids. MRS is a young field, but it has many
potential applications requiring rheological characterization of scarcely

previously unknown molecular outflows in the MonR2 clump. Comparing these
outflows with known IR sources in the IRS5 and IRS3 subclusters allows for
tentative identification of driving stars. Line images of molecular species
such as CH3CN or CH3OH show that, besides IRS3 (a well-known hot molecular
core), IRS5 is also a chemically active source in the region. The gas
excitation temperature derived from CH3CN lines toward IRS5 is 144 \pm 15 K,
indicating a deeply embedded protostar at the hot-core evolutionary stage. SED
fitting of IRS5 gives a mass of ~7 M_Sun and a luminosity of 300 L_Sun for the
central source. The derived physical properties of the CO outflows suggest that
they contribute to the turbulent support of the MonR2 complex and to the gas
velocity dispersion in the clump's center. The detection of a large number of

component of real purchasing decisions with decades of experimental validation.
Marketers have recently developed statistical methods that can estimate
quantitative choice models that include consideration set formation via
non-compensatory screening rules. But is capturing consideration within models
of choice important for design? This paper reports on a simulation study of a
vehicle portfolio design when households screen over vehicle body style built
to explore the importance of capturing consideration rules for optimal
designers. We generate synthetic market share data, fit a variety of discrete
choice models to the data, and then optimize design decisions using the
estimated models. Model predictive power, design ""error"", and profitability
relative to ideal profits are compared as the amount of market data available
increases. We find that even when estimated compensatory models provide
relatively good predictive accuracy, they can lead to sub-optimal design
decisions when the population uses consideration behavior; convergence of
compensatory models to non-compensatory behavior is likely to require
unrealistic amounts of data; and modeling heterogeneity in non-compensatory
screening is more valuable than heterogeneity in compensatory trade-offs. This
supports the claim that designers should carefully identify consideration
behaviors before optimizing product portfolios. We also find that higher model
predictive power does not necessarily imply better design decisions; that is,
different model forms can provide ""descriptive"" rather than ""predictive""
information that is useful for design.

extreme black-widow gamma-ray pulsar with a helium-star companion. In a
previous study we estimated the neutron star mass as M_NS= 2.68+/-0.14M_Sun
(statistical error), based on limited spectroscopy and a basic (direct heating)
light curve model; however, much larger model-dependent systematics dominate
the mass uncertainty. Our new spectroscopy reveals a range of complex source
behavior. The variable He I companion wind emission lines can dominate
broad-band photometry, especially in red filters or near minimum brightness,
and the wind flux should complete companion evaporation in a spin-down time.
The heated companion face also undergoes dramatic flares, reaching 40,000K over
20% of the star; this is likely powered by a magnetic field generated in the
companion. The companion center-of-light radial velocity is now well measured
with K_CoL = 615.4+/-5.km/s. We detect non-sinusoidal velocity components due
to the heated face flux distribution. Using our spectra to excise flares and
wind lines, we generate substantially improved light curves for companion
continuum fitting. We show that the inferred inclination and neutron star mass,
however, remain sensitive to the poorly constrained heating pattern. The
neutron star's mass, M_NS, is likely less than the direct heating value and
could range as low as 1.8M_Sun for extreme equatorial heating concentration.
While we cannot yet pin down M_NS, our data imply that an intrabinary shock
reprocesses the pulsar emission and heats the companion. Improved spectra and,
especially, models that include such shock heating are needed for precise
parameter measurement.

great variety of astrophysical sources, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
and Gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The only known analytic solution to the BZ
mechanism is a split monopole perturbation solution up to $O(a^2)$, where $a$
is the spin parameter of a Kerr black hole. In this paper, we extend the
monopole solution to higher order $\sim O(a^4)$. We carefully investigate the
structure of the BH magnetosphere, including the angular velocity of magnetic
field lines $\Omega$, the toroidal magnetic field $B^\phi$ as well as the
poloidal electric current $I$. In addition, the relevant energy extraction rate
$\dot E$ and the stability of this high-order monopole perturbation solution
are also examined.

friction in connection with the structure and energetics of the solid surface
is lacking. Here we show for the first time that \textit{ab initio} molecular
dynamics can be used to unravel the connection between the structure of
nanoscale water and friction for liquid water in contact with graphene and with
hexagonal boron nitride. We find that whilst the interface presents a very
similar structure between the two sheets, the friction coefficient on boron
nitride is $\approx 3$ times larger than that on graphene. This comes about
because of the greater corrugation of the energy landscape on boron nitride
arising from specific electronic structure effects. We discuss how a subtle
dependence of the friction on the atomistic details of a surface, that is not
related to its wetting properties, may have a significant impact on the
transport of water at the nanoscale, with implications for the development of
membranes for desalination and for osmotic power harvesting.

coronal envelope above. The interface represents a free surface. We compare our
model to models that have no coronal envelope. The presence of a coronal
envelope is found to modify the Reynolds stress and the $\Lambda$ effect
resulting in a weaker and non-cylindrical differential rotation. This is
related to the reduced latitudinal temperature variations that are caused by
and dependent on the angular velocity. Some simulations develop a near-surface
shear layer that we can relate to a sign change in the meridional Reynolds
stress term in the thermal wind balance equation. Furthermore, the presence of
a free surface changes the magnetic field evolution since the toroidal field is
concentrated closer to the surface. In all simulations, however, the migration
direction of the mean magnetic field can be explained by the Parker--Yoshimura
rule, which is consistent with earlier findings. A realistic treatment of the
upper boundary in spherical dynamo simulations is crucial for the dynamics of
the flow and magnetic field evolution.

underlying broad component from the inner accretion disk, with a clear red wing
to the emission profile. Based on simulations, we find the detection of this

implies that iron emission from the inner disk is relatively common in the

established that the generation of octupolar out-of-plane magnetic field
structure in a stressed $X$-point collapse is due to ion currents. The field
has a central region, comprising of the well-known qaudrupolar field
(quadrupolar components), as well as four additional poles of reversed polarity
closer to the corners of the domain (octupolar components). In this extended
work, the dependence of the octupolar structure on domain size and ion mass
variation is investigated. Simulations show that the strength and spatial
structure of the generated octupolar magnetic field is independent of ion to
electron mass ratio. Thus showing that ion currents play a significant role in
out-of-plane magnetic structure generation in physically realistic scenarios.
Simulations of different system sizes show that the width of the octupolar
structure remains the same and has a spacial extent of the order of the ion
inertial length. The width of the structure thus appears to be independent on
boundary condition effects. The length of the octupolar structure however
increases for greater domain sizes, prescribed by the external system size.
This was found to be a consequence of the structure of the in-plane magnetic
field in the outflow region halting the particle flow and thus terminating the
in-plane currents that generate the out-of-plane field. The generation of
octupolar magnetic field structure is also established in a tearing-mode
reconnection scenario. The differences in the generation of the octupolar field
and resulting qualitative differences between $X$-point collapse and
tearing-mode are discussed.

of the inflaton starts to dominate, the energy density of the other fields at

fraction will be small at the horizon exit due to the inflationary expansion,
they can alter the scale dependence of the spectrum. At the same time, velocity
of the inflaton field may not coincide with the slow-roll (attractor) velocity.
Those dynamics could be ubiquitous but can easily alter the scale dependence of
the spectrum. Since the scale dependence is currently used to constrain or even
exclude inflation models, it is very important to measure its shift, which is
due to the dynamics that does not appear in the original inflation model.
Considering typical examples, we show that the spectral index of the tensor

be the main bottleneck in millimeter wave (mmWave) networks. Moreover, with the
anticipated vision that mmWave networks would have a dense deployment of base
stations, interference from strong line-of-sight base stations increases too,
thus further increasing the probability of outage. To address the issue of
reducing outage, this paper explores the possibility of base station
cooperation in the downlink of a mmWave heterogenous network. The main focus of
this work is showing that, in a stochastic geometry framework, cooperation from
randomly located base stations decreases outage probability. With the presumed
vision that less severe fading will be experienced due to highly directional
transmissions, one might expect that cooperation would increase the coverage
probability; our numerical examples suggest that is in fact the case. Coverage
probabilities are derived accounting for: different fading distributions,
antenna directionality and blockage. Numerical results suggest that coverage
with base station cooperation in dense mmWave systems and with no small scale
fading considerably exceeds coverage with no cooperation. In contrast, an
insignificant increase is reported when mmWave networks are less dense with a
high probability of signal blockage and with Rayleigh fading.

the local service area and migration requests (MRs) generated when mobile users
move across service areas. A novel resource management scheme is proposed to
help the resource manager decide whether to accept the service requests (NRs or

service (if accepted). The optimization objective is to maximize the average
system reward and keep the rejection probability of service requests under a
certain threshold. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme can
significantly improve the overall system utility as well as the user experience

globular cluster candidates varies from group to group, from equal numbers to
the extreme of HCG 31 which has a ratio of 8 to 1, due to a recent starburst
induced by interactions in the group. We find that the number of blue clusters
with $M_V < -9$ correlates well with the current star formation rate in an
individual galaxy, while the number of globular cluster candidates with $M_V <
-7.8$ correlates well (though with large scatter) with the stellar mass.

density at dwarf-galaxy scales, for which we have derived from the Milky Way

constancy. This is due to the striking difference between mass-concentration
relations for CDM and WDM halos at low halo-mass scales. In order to explain
the universal surface density of dwarf-galaxy scales in WDM models, we suggest
that WDM particles need to be heavier than 3 keV.

techniques have been applied to galaxy-scale and cluster-scale lenses, the
paucity of intermediate-mass systems with high-quality data has precluded a
uniform analysis of mass-dependent trends. With the aim of bridging this gap,
we present new observations and analyses of 10 group-scale lenses at <z>=0.36
characterized by Einstein radii theta_Ein=2.5""-5.1"" and a mean halo mass of
M_200=10^14.0 Msol. We measure a mean concentration c_200=5.0+-0.8 consistent
with unmodified cold dark matter halos. By combining our data with other lens
samples, we analyze the mass structure of ETGs in 10^13 Msol-10^15 Msol halos
using homogeneous techniques. We show that the slope of the total density
profile gamma_tot within the effective radius depends on the stellar surface
density, as demonstrated previously, but also on the halo mass. We analyze
these trends using halo occupation models and resolved stellar kinematics with
the goal of testing the universality of the DM profile. Whereas the central
galaxies of clusters require a shallow inner DM density profile, group-scale
lenses are consistent with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile or one that is
slightly contracted. The largest uncertainties arise from the sample size and
likely radial gradients in stellar populations. We conclude that the net effect
of baryons on the DM distribution may not be universal, but more likely varies
with halo mass due to underlying trends in star formation efficiency and
assembly history.

key questions in pulsar magnetospheric physics. A very extensive literature
exists about the assumption of a dipolar magnetic field but very little
progress has been made in attempts to include multipolar components in a
self-consistent way. In this paper, we study the effect of multipolar
electromagnetic fields anchored in the star. We give exact analytical solutions
in closed form for any order $l$ and apply them to the retarded point
quadrupole ($l=2$), hexapole ($l=3$) and octopole ($l=4$), a generalization of
the retarded point dipole ($l=1$). We also compare the Poynting flux from each
multipole and show that the spin down luminosity depends on the ratio $R/r_{\rm
L}$, $R$ being the neutron star radius and $r_{\rm L}$ the light-cylinder
radius. Therefore the braking index also depends on $R/r_{\rm L}$. As such
multipole fields possess very different topology, most importantly smaller
length scales compared to the dipolar field, especially close to the neutron
star, we investigate the deformation of the polar caps induced by these
multipolar fields. Such fields could have a strong impact on the interpretation
of the pulsed radio emission suspected to emanate from these polar caps as well
as on the inferred geometry deduced from the high-energy light-curve fitting
and on the magnetic field strength. Discrepancies between the two-pole caustic
model and our new multipole-caustic model are emphasized with the quadrupole
field. To this respect, we demonstrate that working with only a dipole field
can be very misleading.

how such an approach to afterglow analysis works in practice, paying special

precision, and repeatability, of one part in $\sim 10^4$. This is beyond the
original calibration plans of current observatories, hence the necessity to
disentangle the instrumental systematics from the astrophysical signals in raw
datasets. Most methods used in the literature are based on an approximate
instrument model. The choice of parameters of the model and their functional
forms can sometimes be subjective, causing controversies in the literature.
Recently, Morello et al. (2014, 2015) have developed a non-parametric
detrending method that gave coherent and repeatable results when applied to
Spitzer/IRAC datasets that were debated in the literature. Said method is based
on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of individual pixel time-series,
hereafter ""pixel-ICA"". The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the
limits and advantages of pixel-ICA on a series of simulated datasets with
different instrument properties, and a range of jitter timescales and shapes,
non-stationarity, sudden change points, etc. The performances of pixel-ICA are
compared against the ones of other methods, in particular polynomial centroid

regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are clumpy. Hence. in this paper, we
run radiative transfer models in the optical/UV for a variety of AGN
reprocessing regions with different distributions of clumpy scattering media.
We use the latest version of the Monte Carlo code STOKES presented in the first
two papers of this series to model AGN reprocessing regions of increasing
morphological complexity. We replace previously uniform-density media with up
to thousands of constant-density clumps. We couple a continuum source to
fragmented equatorial scattering regions, polar outflows, and toroidal,
obscuring dust regions and investigate a wide range of geometries. We also
consider different levels of fragmentation in each scattering region to
evaluate importance of fragmentation for the net polarization of the AGN. We
find that, in comparison with uniform-density models, equatorial distributions
of gas and dust clouds result in grayer spectra, and show a decrease of the net
polarization percentage at all lines of sight. The resulting polarization
position angle depends on the morphology of the clumpy structure, with extended
tori favoring parallel polarization while compact tori produce orthogonal
polarization position angles. In the case of polar scattering regions,
fragmentation increases the net polarization unless the cloud filling factor is
small. A complete set of AGN models constructed from the individual, fragmented
regions is investigated. Our modeling shows that the introduction of fragmented
dusty tori significantly alters the resulting net polarization of an AGN.
Comparison of our models to polarization observations of large AGN samples
greatly favors geometrically compact clumpy tori over extended ones.

have retained volatiles in the gas phase, which implies the presence of an
atmosphere that can affect their reflectance spectra and thermal balance.
Volatile escape rates driven by solar heating of the surface were estimated by
Schaller and Brown (2007) (SB) and Levi and Podolak (2009)(LP) using Jeans
escape from the surface and a hydrodynamic model respectively. Based on recent
molecular kinetic simulations these rates can be hugely in error (e.g., a
factor of $\sim 10^{16}$ for the SB estimate for Pluto). In this paper we
estimate the loss of primordial N$_2$ for several large KBOs guided by recent
molecular kinetic simulations of escape due to solar heating of the surface and
due to UV/EUV heating of the upper atmosphere. For the latter we extrapolate
simulations of escape from Pluto (Erwin et al. 2013) using the energy limited
escape model recently validated for the KBOs of interest by molecular kinetic
simulations (Johnson et al. 2013). Unless the N$_2$ atmosphere is thin
($\lesssim 10^{18}$ N$_2$/cm$^2$) and/or the radius small ($\lesssim 200-300$
km), we find that escape is primarily driven by the UV/EUV radiation absorbed
in the upper atmosphere rather than the solar heating of the surface. This
affects the previous interpretations of the relationship between atmospheric
loss and the observed surface properties. The long-term goal is to connect
detailed atmospheric loss simulations with a model for volatile transport
(e.g., Young, 2014) for individual KBOs.

use the combined set of 44 M_UV estimates and limits to construct the M_UV
luminosity function (LF) for GRB host galaxies over 3<z<5 and compare it to
expectations from Lyman break galaxy (LBG) photometric surveys with the Hubble

of galaxy dust obscuration (and hence, total star formation rate), we find that
our LF is compatible with LBG observations over a factor of 600x in host
luminosity, from M_UV = -22.5 mag to >-15.6 mag, and with extrapolations of the
assumed Schechter-type LF well beyond this range. We review proposed

the timing provided by the competition of the ionisation processes in the
different drift regions, which can be exploited for fast timing at the high
luminosity accelerators (e.g. HL-LHC upgrade) as well as far applications like

  On-line Data-Intensive Applications","13 pages",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Datacenters running on-line, data-intensive applications (OLDIs) consume
significant amounts of energy. However, reducing their energy is challenging
due to their tight response time requirements. A key aspect of OLDIs is that
each user query goes to all or many of the nodes in the cluster, so that the
overall time budget is dictated by the tail of the replies' latency
distribution; replies see latency variations both in the network and compute.
Previous work proposes to achieve load-proportional energy by slowing down the
computation at lower datacenter loads based directly on response times (i.e.,
at lower loads, the proposal exploits the average slack in the time budget
provisioned for the peak load). In contrast, we propose TimeTrader to reduce
energy by exploiting the latency slack in the sub- critical replies which
arrive before the deadline (e.g., 80% of replies are 3-4x faster than the
tail). This slack is present at all loads and subsumes the previous work's
load-related slack. While the previous work shifts the leaves' response time
distribution to consume the slack at lower loads, TimeTrader reshapes the
distribution at all loads by slowing down individual sub-critical nodes without
increasing missed deadlines. TimeTrader exploits slack in both the network and
compute budgets. Further, TimeTrader leverages Earliest Deadline First
scheduling to largely decouple critical requests from the queuing delays of
sub- critical requests which can then be slowed down without hurting critical
requests. A combination of real-system measurements and at-scale simulations
shows that without adding to missed deadlines, TimeTrader saves 15-19% and
41-49% energy at 90% and 30% loading, respectively, in a datacenter with 512
nodes, whereas previous work saves 0% and 31-37%.

can be seen as irreversible random dynamics of discrete interfaces.
""Irreversible"" means that the interface has an average non-zero drift.
Interface configurations correspond to height functions of dimer coverings of
the infinite hexagonal or square lattice. The model can also be viewed as an
interacting driven particle system and in the totally asymmetric case the
dynamics corresponds to an infinite collection of mutually interacting
Hammersley processes.
  When the dynamical asymmetry parameter $(p-q)$ equals zero, the
infinite-volume Gibbs measures $\pi_\rho$ (with given slope $\rho$) are
stationary and reversible. When $p\ne q$, $\pi_\rho$ are not reversible any
more but, remarkably, they are still stationary. In such stationary states, we
find that the average height function at any given point $x$ grows linearly
with time $t$ with a non-zero speed: $\mathbb E Q_x(t):=\mathbb
E(h_x(t)-h_x(0))= V(\rho) t$ while the typical fluctuations of $Q_x(t)$ are
smaller than any power of $t$ as $t\to\infty$.
  In the totally asymmetric case of $p=0,q=1$ and on the hexagonal lattice, the
dynamics coincides with the ""anisotropic KPZ growth model"" introduced by A.
Borodin and P. L. Ferrari. For a suitably chosen, ""integrable"", initial
condition (that is very far from the stationary state), they were able to
determine the hydrodynamic limit and a CLT for interface fluctuations on scale
$\sqrt{\log t}$, exploiting the fact that in that case certain space-time
height correlations can be computed exactly.

the OICC covers only one period whereas several periods are taken into account

developed for this purpose and a special mention is paid to the modeling of the
MICC.
  Based on a numerical example, we firstly analyse the effects of the OICC and
the MICC on the optimal decisions (asset allocation and contribution rate) of a
pension fund. By definition, the MICC is more restrictive and safer compared to
the OICC. Secondly, we quantify this MICC safety increase. The results show
that although the optimal decisions from the OICC and the MICC differ, the

approach since it is more prudent.

tremendously enhanced by driving the cavity and the quantum dot simultaneously

ascribed to the quantum interference effect to avoid two-photon excitation of
the cavity field. Comparing with Jaynes-Cummings model, the second-order
correlation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)}(0)$ in our scheme can be
reduced by two orders of magnitude and the system sustains a large intracavity
photon number. A red (blue) cavity-light detuning asymmetry for photon quantum
statistics with bunching or antibunching characteristics is also observed. The
photon blockade effect has a controllable flexibility by tuning the relative
phase between the two pumping laser fields and the Rabi coupling strength
between the quantum dot and the pumping field. Moreover, the photon blockade
scheme based on quantum interference mechanism does not require a strong
coupling strength between the cavity and the quantum dot, even with the pure
dephasing of the system. This simple proposal provides an effective way for
potential applications in solid state quantum computation and quantum

limitations in its present formulation which hinder its application to some
highly-entangled systems. The purpose of this paper is to unravel some of these

this, we first introduce the fast full update scheme, where effective

dramatic computational savings, and (ii) improved overall stability. Besides,

to the case of symmetric M-theory backgrounds (i.e. $(M,g,F)$ with $(M,g)$ a
symmetric space and $F$ an invariant closed 4-form), we derive several criteria
for such a background to preserve some supersymmetry and consequently find all
supersymmetric symmetric M-theory backgrounds.

  black holes","21 pages, 1 figure",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The pair-production process for a black hole (BH) is discussed within the
framework of a recently proposed semiclassical model of BH evaporation. Our
emphasis is on how the requirements of unitary evolution and strong
subadditivity act to constrain the state of the produced pairs and their
entanglement with the already emitted BH radiation. We find that the state of
the produced pairs is indeed strongly constrained but that the semiclassical
model is consistent with all requirements. We are led to the following picture:
Initially, the pairs are produced in a state of nearly maximal entanglement
amongst the partners, with a parametrically small entanglement between each
positive-energy partner and the outgoing radiation, similar to Hawking's model.
But, as the BH evaporation progresses past the Page time, each positive-energy
partner has a stronger entanglement with the outgoing radiation and,
consequently, is less strongly entangled with its negative-energy partner. We
present some evidence that this pattern of entanglement does not require
non-local interactions, only EPR-like non-local correlations.

two monolayers of C$_{60}$ deposited on top of a thin film of
Copper-Phthalocyanine (CuPC) is excited by an optical pump pulse and the
induced electronic dynamics are probed with 590 eV X-ray pulses. Charge
transfer from the electron donor (CuPC) to the acceptor (C$_{60}$) and
subsequent charge carrier dynamics are monitored by recording the
time-dependent C 1$s$ core level photoemission spectrum of the system. The
arrival of electrons in the C$_{60}$ layer is readily observed as a completely
reversible, transient shift of the C$_{60}$ associated C 1$s$ core level, while
the C 1$s$ level of the CuPC remains unchanged. The capability to probe charge
transfer and recombination dynamics in OPV assemblies directly in the time
domain and from the perspective of well-defined domains is expected to open
additional pathways to better understand and optimize the performance of this
emerging technology.

partially ionized because of their relative low temperature. In this Letter, we
address the long-standing problem of how the neutral component of the plasma in
prominences is supported against gravity. Using the multiple fluid approach we
solve the time-dependent equations in two dimensions considering the frictional
coupling between the neutral and ionized components of the magnetized plasma
representative of a solar prominence embedded in a hot coronal environment. We
demonstrate that given an initial density enhancement in the two fluids,
representing the body of the prominence, the system is able to relax in the
vicinity of magnetic dips to a stationary state in which both neutrals and
ionized species are dynamically suspended above the photosphere. Two different
coupling processes are considered in this study, collisions between ions and
neutrals and charge exchange interactions. We find that for realistic
conditions ions are essentially static while neutrals have a very small
downflow velocity. The coupling between ions and neutrals is so strong at the
prominence body that the behavior is similar to that of a single fluid with an
effective density equal to the sum of the ion and neutral species. We also find
that the charge exchange mechanism is about three times more efficient
sustaining neutrals than elastic scattering of ions with neutrals.

can detect target signal buried in clutter without knowledge of clutter
subspace. This detector makes use of the geometrical relation between target

magnetic reconnection. We use data from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST),
to study EB events on the solar disk and at the limb. Both datasets show that
EBs are connected to the foot-points of forming chromospheric jets. The limb
observations show that a bright structure in the H$\alpha$ blue wing connects
to the EB initially fuelling it, leading to the ejection of material upwards.
The material moves along a loop structure where a newly formed jet is
subsequently observed in the red wing of H$\alpha$. In the disk dataset, an EB
initiates a jet which propagates away from the apparent reconnection site
within the EB flame. The EB then splits into two, with associated brightenings
in the inter-granular lanes (IGLs). Micro-jets are then observed, extending to
500 km with a lifetime of a few minutes. Observed velocities of the micro-jets
are approximately 5-10 km s$^{-1}$, while their chromospheric counterparts
range from 50-80 km s$^{-1}$. MURaM simulations of quiet Sun reconnection show
that micro-jets with similar properties to that of the observations follow the
line of reconnection in the photosphere, with associated H$\alpha$ brightening
at the location of increased temperature.

possible additional phase transitions, through their influence on elastic and
anelastic relaxations that occur as a function of temperature between 2 and 300

accompanied by acoustic loss and softening, and a weak magnetoelastic effect is

magnetic defects which couple with strain and may play a role in pinning of

or transit measurements in nearly continuous time series. This paper shows how
to obtain the period error in such measurements from a basic linear
least-squares fit, and how to correctly derive the timing error in the
prediction of future transit or eclipse events. Assuming strict periodicity, a
formula for the period error of such time series is derived: sigma_P = sigma_T
(12/( N^3-N))^0.5, where sigma_P is the period error; sigma_T the timing error
of a single measurement and N the number of measurements. Relative to the
iterative method for period error estimation by Mighell & Plavchan (2013), this
much simpler formula leads to smaller period errors, whose correctness has been
verified through simulations. For the prediction of times of future periodic
events, the usual linear ephemeris where epoch errors are quoted for the first
time measurement, are prone to overestimation of the error of that prediction.
This may be avoided by a correction for the duration of the time series. An
alternative is the derivation of ephemerides whose reference epoch and epoch
error are given for the centre of the time series. For long continuous or
near-continuous time series whose acquisition is completed, such central epochs
should be the preferred way for the quotation of linear ephemerides. While this
work was motivated from the analysis of eclipse timing measures in space-based
light curves, it should be applicable to any other problem with an
uninterrupted sequence of discrete timings for which the determination of a
zero point, of a constant period and of the associated errors is needed.

different models of the thermal evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). In
the combined model, where the densities are low enough that at least some part
of the spectrum is optically thin, a model of the thermodynamics of the diffuse
ISM is more significant in setting the temperatures. Where the densities are
high enough to be optically thick across the spectrum, a model of flux limited
diffusion is more appropriate. Previous methods either model the low-density
interstellar medium and ignore the thermal behaviour at high densities (e.g.
inside collapsing molecular cloud cores), or model the thermal behaviour near
protostars but assume a fixed background temperature (e.g. approximately 10 K)
on large-scales. Our new method treats both regimes. It also captures the
different thermal evolution of the gas, dust, and radiation separately. We
compare our results with those from the literature, and investigate the
dependence of the thermal behaviour of the gas on the various model parameters.
This new method should allow us to model the ISM across a wide range of
densities and, thus, develop a more complete and consistent understanding of
the role of thermodynamics in the star formation process.

constraining the neutron star equation of state (EOS) using signals from
coalescing binary neutron stars, or neutron star-black hole systems, as they
will be seen in upcoming advanced gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo. In particular, it was estimated to what extent the
combined information from multiple detections would enable one to distinguish
between different equations of state through hypothesis ranking or parameter
estimation. Under the assumption of zero neutron star spins both in signals and
in template waveforms and considering tidal effects to 1 post-Newtonian (1PN)
order, it was found that O(20) sources would suffice to distinguish between a
hard, moderate, and soft equation of state. Here we revisit these results, this
time including neutron star tidal effects to the highest order currently known,
termination of gravitational waveforms at the contact frequency, neutron star
spins, and the resulting quadrupole-monopole interaction. We also take the
masses of neutron stars in simulated sources to be distributed according to a
relatively strongly peaked Gaussian, as hinted at by observations, but without
assuming that the data analyst will necessarily have accurate knowledge of this
distribution for use as a mass prior. We find that especially the effect of the
latter is dramatic, necessitating many more detections to distinguish between
different EOS and causing systematic biases in parameter estimation, on top of
biases due to imperfect understanding of the signal model pointed out in
earlier work. This would get mitigated if reliable prior information about the
mass distribution could be folded into the analyses.

large scale structure out to distances of a few times 100 Mpc/h. Using the
largest and most accurate ever catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities
""Cosmicflows-2"", the large scale structure has been reconstructed by means of
the Wiener filter and constrained realizations assuming as a Bayesian prior
model the LCDM model with the WMAP inferred cosmological parameters. The
present paper focuses on studying the bulk flow of the local flow field,
defined as the mean velocity of top-hat spheres with radii ranging out to R=500
Mpc/h. The estimated large scale structures, in general, and the bulk flow, in
particular, are determined by the tension between the observational data and
the assumed prior model. A prerequisite for such an analysis is the requirement
that the estimated bulk flow is consistent with the prior model. Such a
consistency is found here. At R=50(150) Mpc/h the estimated bulk velocity is
250+/-21 (239+/-38) km/s. The corresponding cosmic variance at these radii is
126(60)km/s, which implies that these estimated bulk flows are dominated by the
data and not by the assumed prior model. The estimated bulk velocity is
dominated by the data out to R~200 Mpc/h, where the cosmic variance on the
individual Supergalactic Cartesian components (of the r.m.s. values) exceeds
the variance of the Constrained Realizations by at least a factor of 2. The
supergalactic SGX and SGY components of the CMB dipole velocity are recovered
by the Wiener filter velocity field down to a very few km/s. The SGZ component
of the estimated velocity, the one that is most affected by the Zone of
Avoidance, is off by 126 km/s (an almost 2 sigma discrepancy).

(FPR) which extends fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) by operators that
determine the rank of matrices over finite fields. While FPR can express most
of the known queries that separate FPC from PTIME, nearly nothing was known
about the limitations of its expressive power.
  In our first main result we show that the extensions of FPC by rank operators
over different prime fields are incomparable. This solves an open question
posed by Dawar and Holm and also implies that rank logic, in its original
definition with a distinct rank operator for every field, fails to capture
polynomial time. In particular we show that the variant of rank logic FPR* with
an operator that uniformly expresses the matrix rank over finite fields is more
expressive than FPR.
  One important step in our proof is to consider solvability logic FPS which is
the analogous extension of FPC by quantifiers which express the solvability
problem for linear equation systems over finite fields. Solvability logic can
easily be embedded into rank logic, but it is open whether it is a strict
fragment. In our second main result we give a partial answer to this question:
in the absence of counting, rank operators are strictly more expressive than
solvability quantifiers.

  This paper presents YouLighter, an unsupervised technique to identify changes

co-located identical caches into edge-nodes. This automatically unveils the

allow comparison between the clustering results from the same dataset, no

Hence, we develop a novel methodology, based on the Constellation Distance, to

  By running YouLighter over 10-month long traces obtained from two ISPs in

  Training to Minimize False Merges in Electron Microscopy Segmentation",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The prospect of neural reconstruction from Electron Microscopy (EM) images
has been elucidated by the automatic segmentation algorithms. Although
segmentation algorithms eliminate the necessity of tracing the neurons by hand,
significant manual effort is still essential for correcting the mistakes they
make. A considerable amount of human labor is also required for annotating
groundtruth volumes for training the classifiers of a segmentation framework.
It is critically important to diminish the dependence on human interaction in
the overall reconstruction system. This study proposes a novel classifier
training algorithm for EM segmentation aimed to reduce the amount of manual
effort demanded by the groundtruth annotation and error refinement tasks.
Instead of using an exhaustive pixel level groundtruth, an active learning
algorithm is proposed for sparse labeling of pixel and boundaries of
superpixels. Because over-segmentation errors are in general more tolerable and
easier to correct than the under-segmentation errors, our algorithm is designed
to prioritize minimization of false-merges over false-split mistakes. Our
experiments on both 2D and 3D data suggest that the proposed method yields
segmentation outputs that are more amenable to neural reconstruction than those
of existing methods.

high-dimensional in the sense that the series of approximating functions for

time-frequency or time-scale representations, the representation coefficients

we refer to the process of nonlinear evaluation according to a bijective,

continuity and invertibility, we will show that a large subclass of warping
functions gives rise to families of generalized coorbit spaces, i.e. Banach
spaces of functions whose representations possess a certain localization.
Furthermore, we obtain sufficient conditions for subsampled warped
time-frequency systems to form atomic decompositions and Banach frames. To this
end, we extend results previously presented by Fornasier and Rauhut to a larger
class of function systems via a simple, but crucial modification. The proposed
method allows for great flexibility, but by choosing particular warping
functions we also recover classical time-frequency representations, e.g. $F(t)
= ct$ provides the short-time Fourier transform and $F(t)=\log_a(t)$ provides
wavelet transforms. This is illustrated by a number of examples provided in the

  landscapes",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Having a precise knowledge of the dispersal ability of a population in a
heterogeneous environment is of critical importance in agroecology and
conservation biology as it can provide management tools to limit the effects of
pests or to increase the survival of endangered species. In this paper, we
propose a mechanistic-statistical method to estimate space-dependent diffusion
parameters of spatially-explicit models based on stochastic differential
equations, using genetic data. Dividing the total population into
subpopulations corresponding to different habitat patches with known allele
frequencies, the expected proportions of individuals from each subpopulation at
each position is computed by solving a system of reaction-diffusion equations.
Modelling the capture and genotyping of the individuals with a statistical
approach, we derive a numerically tractable formula for the likelihood function
associated with the diffusion parameters.
  In a simulated environment made of three types of regions, each associated
with a different diffusion coefficient, we successfully estimate the diffusion
parameters with a maximum-likelihood approach. Although higher genetic
differentiation among subpopulations leads to more accurate estimations, once a
certain level of differentiation has been reached, the finite size of the
genotyped population becomes the limiting factor for accurate estimation.

  the title, some typos fixed, some references added",,,,"math.OC math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  p2pOC is an add-on toolbox to the Matlab package pde2path. It is aimed at the
numerical solution of optimal control (OC) problems with an infinite time
horizon for parabolic systems of PDE over 1D or 2D spatial domains. The basic
idea is to treat the OC problem via the associated canonical system in two
steps. First we use pde2path to find branches of stationary solutions of the
canonical system, also called canonical steady states (CSS). In a second step
we use the results and the spatial discretization of the first step to
calculate the objective values of time-dependent canonical paths ending at a
CSS with the so called saddle point property. This is a (typically very high
dimensional) boundary value problem (BVP) in time, which we solve by combining
a modification of the BVP solver TOM with a continuation algorithm in the
initial states. We explain the design and usage of the package via two example
problems, namely the optimal management of a distributed shallow lake model,
and of a semi-arid grazing system. Both show interesting bifurcations of so
called patterned CSS, and in particular the latter also a variety of patterned
optimal steady states. The package (library and demos) can be downloaded at

consequence of the validity of the Einstein relation and the decay of
correlations of the random polymer. We test the independence on correlations of
the diffusion coefficient for correlated polymers produced by two different
stochastic processes, a one-step Markov chain and the expansion-modification
system. Within the accuracy of our simulations, we found that the numerically
obtained diffusion coefficient for these systems agree with the analytically

allows us to photometrically measure both components of the spin-orbit angle
$\psi$, its sky projection $\lambda$ and inclination of the stellar spin axis
$i_\star$. In this paper, we apply the method to two transiting hot Jupiter
systems monitored with the Kepler spacecraft, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-7. For
Kepler-13A, we find $i_\star=81^\circ\pm5^\circ$ and $\psi=60^\circ\pm2^\circ$
adopting the spectroscopic constraint $\lambda=58.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$ by
Johnson et al. (2014). In our solution, the discrepancy between the above
$\lambda$ and that previously reported by Barnes et al. (2011) is solved by
fitting both of the two parameters in the quadratic limb-darkening law. We also
report the temporal variation in the orbital inclination of Kepler-13Ab,
$\mathrm{d} |\cos i_{\rm
orb}|/\mathrm{d}t=(-7.0\pm0.4)\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, providing
further evidence for the spin-orbit precession in this system. By fitting the
precession model to the time series of $i_{\rm orb}$, $\lambda$, and $i_\star$
obtained with the gravity-darkened model, we constrain the stellar quadrupole
moment $J_2=(6.1\pm0.3)\times10^{-5}$ for our new solution, which is several
times smaller than $J_2=(1.66\pm0.08)\times10^{-4}$ obtained for the previous
one. We show that the difference can be observable in the future evolution of
$\lambda$, thus providing a possibility to test our solution with follow-up
observations. The second target, HAT-P-7, is the first F-dwarf star analyzed
with the gravity-darkening method. Our analysis points to a nearly pole-on
configuration with $\psi=101^\circ\pm2^\circ$ or $87^\circ\pm2^\circ$ and the
gravity-darkening exponent $\beta$ consistent with $0.25$. Such an

  Natural Disaster Situations",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During recent years the online social networks (in particular Twitter) have
become an important alternative information channel to traditional media during
natural disasters, but the amount and diversity of messages poses the challenge
of information overload to end users. The goal of our research is to develop an
automatic classifier of tweets to feed a mobile application that reduces the
difficulties that citizens face to get relevant information during natural
disasters. In this paper, we present in detail the process to build a
classifier that filters tweets relevant and non-relevant to an earthquake. By
using a dataset from the Chilean earthquake of 2010, we first build and
validate a ground truth, and then we contribute by presenting in detail the
effect of class imbalance and dimensionality reduction over 5 classifiers. We
show how the performance of these models is affected by these variables,
providing important considerations at the moment of building these systems.

in computing systems. In this paper, we consider a computational grid in which
the mobile devices can share their idle resources to realize parallel
processing. The overall computing task can be arbitrarily partitioned into
multiple subtasks to be distributed to mobile resource providers (RPs). In this
process, the computation load scheduling problem is highlighted. Based on the
optimization objective, i.e., minimizing the task makespan, a buyer-seller
model in which the task sponsor can inspire the SPs to share their computing
resources by paying certain profits, is proposed. The Stackelberg Pricing Game
(SPG) is employed to obtain the optimal price and shared resource amount of
each SP. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by
system simulation and the results indicate that the SPG-based load scheduling
algorithm can significantly improve the time gain in mobile grid systems.

two methods to improve controllability. In this paper, controllability of
multi-agent systems under directed topologies is studied, especially on leader
selection problem and weight adjustment problem. For a given system, necessary
and sufficient algebraic conditions for controllability with fewest leaders are
proposed. From another perspective, when leaders are fixed, controllability
could be improved by adjusting edge weights, and therefore the system is
supposed to be structurally controllable, which holds if and only if the
communication topology contains a spanning tree. It is also proved that the
number of fewest edges needed to be assigned on new weights equals the rank
deficiency of controllability matrix. An algorithm on how to perform weight
adjustment is presented. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the
theoretical results.

fundamental physics explorations and device applications. Unlike gapless
graphene, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) has new optical
functionalities for next generation ultra-compact electronic and
opto-electronic devices. When TMDC crystals are thinned down to monolayers,
they undergo an indirect to direct bandgap transition, making it an outstanding
2D semiconductor. Unique electron valley degree of freedom, strong light matter
interactions and excitonic effects were observed. Enhancement of spontaneous
emission has been reported on TMDC monolayers integrated with photonic crystal
and distributed Bragg reflector microcavities. However, the coherent light
emission from 2D monolayer TMDC has not been demonstrated, mainly due to that
an atomic membrane has limited material gain volume and is lack of optical mode
confinement. Here, we report the first realization of 2D excitonic laser by
embedding monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) in a microdisk resonator. Using a
whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator with a high quality factor and optical
confinement, we observed bright excitonic lasing in visible wavelength. The
Si3N4/WS2/HSQ sandwich configuration provides a strong feedback and mode
overlap with monolayer gain. This demonstration of 2D excitonic laser marks a
major step towards 2D on-chip optoelectronics for high performance optical
communication and computing applications.
