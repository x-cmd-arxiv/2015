same problem has been addressed for pure spin Hamiltonians. As a main result,
we show that the relaxation dynamics of the double occupancy and of the
staggered moment are different. The former is controlled by the
nearest-neighbor tunneling rate while the latter is much slower and strongly
dependent on the interaction strength, indicating that spin excitations are
important. This difference in characteristic energy scales for the fast charge
dynamics and the much slower spin dynamics is also reflected in the real-time
evolution of nearest-neighbor density and spin correlations. A very interesting
time dependence emerges in the von Neumann entropy, which at short times
increases linearly with a slope proportional to the tunneling matrix element
while the long-time growth of entanglement is controlled by spin excitations.
Our predictions for the different relaxation dynamics of the staggered moment
and the double occupancy should be observable in state-of-the art optical
lattice experiments. We further compare time averages of the double occupancy
to both the expectation values in the canonical and diagonal ensemble, which
quantitatively disagree with each other on finite systems. We relate the
question of thermalization to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.

exponentially distributed duration, interrupted by random changes in the
direction of motion and resumption of motion in the new direction with the same
speed. We call these walkers ""mortal creepers"". A mortal creeper may die at any
time during its motion according to an exponential decay law characterized by a
finite mean death rate $\omega_m$. While still alive, the creeper has a finite
mean frequency $\omega$ of change of the direction of motion. In particular, we
consider the efficiency of the target search process, characterized by the
probability that the creeper will eventually detect the target. Analytic
results confirmed by numerical results show that there is an
$\omega_m$-dependent optimal frequency $\omega=\omega_{opt}$ that maximizes the
probability of eventual target detection. We work primarily in one-dimensional
($d=1$) domains and examine the role of initial conditions and of finite domain
sizes. Numerical results in $d=2$ domains confirm the existence of an optimal
frequency of change of direction, thereby suggesting that the observed effects
are robust to changes in dimensionality. In the $d=1$ case, explicit
expressions for the probability of target detection in the long time limit are
given. In the case of an infinite domain, we compute the detection probability
for arbitrary times and study its early- and late-time behavior. We further
consider the survival probability of the target in the presence of many
independent creepers beginning their motion at the same location and at the
same time. We also consider a version of the standard ""target problem"" in which
many creepers start at random locations at the same time.

Recently, we demonstrated that a system of dipolar achiral disklike ellipsoids

origin. In the present work, extensive off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations are
used to investigate the phase behavior of the system under the influences of
the electrostatic boundary conditions that restrict any global polarization. We
find that the system develops strongly ferroelectric slablike domains
periodically arranged in an antiferroelectric fashion. Exploring the phase
behavior at different dipole strengths, we find existence of the ferroelectric
nematic and ferroelectric columnar order inside the domains. For higher dipole
strengths, a biaxial phase is also obtained with a similar periodic array of
ferroelectric slabs of antiparallel polarizations. We have studied the
depolarizing effects by using both the Ewald summation and the spherical
cut-off techniques. We present and compare the results of the two different
approaches of considering the depolarizing effects in this anisotropic system.
It is explicitly shown that the domain size increases with the system size as a
result of considering longer range of dipolar interactions. The system exhibits
pronounced system size effects for stronger dipolar interactions. The results
provide strong evidence to the novel understanding that the dipolar
interactions are indeed sufficient to produce long range ferroelectric order in
anisotropic fluids.

imaging and heating therapies, its application for neuromodulation is
relatively new and not well understood. The objective of the present study was
to investigate issues related to interactions between focused acoustic beams
and brain tissues to better understand possible limitations of transcranial
ultrasound for neuromodulation. Approach. A computational model of transcranial
focused ultrasound was constructed and validated against bench top experimental
data. The models were then incrementally extended to address and investigate a
number of issues related to the use of ultrasound for neuromodulation. These
included the effect of variations in skull geometry and gyral anatomy, as well
as the effect of transmission across multiple tissue and media layers, such as
scalp, skull, CSF, and gray/white matter on ultrasound insertion behavior. In
addition, a sensitivity analysis was run to characterize the influence of
acoustic properties of intracranial tissues. Finally, the heating associated
with ultrasonic stimulation waveforms designed for neuromodulation was modeled.

radio galaxies are signposts of such coalescences, and that their abundance
might be used to predict the magnitude of the gravitational wave background. In
Roberts et al. (2015) we present radio images of all 52 X-shaped radio source
candidates out of the sample of 100 selected by Cheung (2007) for which
archival VLA data were available. These images indicate that at most 21% of the
candidates might be genuine X-shaped radio sources that were formed by a
restarting of beams in a new direction following a major merger. This suggests
that fewer than 1.3% of extended radio sources appear to be candidates for
genuine axis reorientations (""spin flips""), much smaller than the 7% suggested
by Leahy and Parma (1992). Thus the associated gravitational wave background
may be substantially smaller than previous estimates. These results can be used
to normalize detailed calculations of the SMBH coalescence rate and the GWB.

coupled to realistically engineered optical cavities. The light intensity is
enhanced at the graphene plane, and so is its absorption, which can be switched

III protostars formed in the early universe. We argue from the Jeans criterion
that primordial gas can collapse to form a cluster of first stars that evolve
relatively independently of one another (i.e., with negligible gravitational
interaction). We model the collapse of individual protostellar clumps using
2+1D nonaxisymmetric numerical hydrodynamics simulations. Each collapse
produces a protostar surrounded by a massive disk (i.e., $M_{\rm disk} / M_{*}
\gtrsim 0.1$), whose evolution we follow for a further 30--40 kyr.
Gravitational instabilities result in the fragmentation and the formation of
gravitationally bound clumps within the disk. The accretion of these fragments
by the host protostar produces accretion and luminosity bursts on the order of
$10^6\,\LSun$. Within the cluster, we show that a simultaneity of such events
across several protostellar cluster members can elevate the cluster luminosity
to 5--10${\times}$ greater than expected, and that the cluster spends
$\sim15\%$ of it's star-forming history at these levels. This enhanced
luminosity effect is particularly enabled in clusters of modest size with
$\simeq$ 10--20 members. In one such instance, we identify a confluence of
burst events that raise the luminosity to nearly $1000{\times}$ greater than
the cluster mean luminosity, resulting in $L > 10^8\,\LSun$. This phenomenon
arises solely through the gravitational-instability--driven episodic
fragmentation and accretion that characterizes this early stage of protostellar
evolution.

function with an extremely large number of parameters. Naturally, existing
gradient descent (GD) based methods are prone to arbitrarily poor local minima.
In this paper, we rigorously show that such local minima can be avoided (upto
an approximation error) by using the dropout technique, a widely used heuristic
in this domain. In particular, we show that by randomly dropping a few nodes of
a one-hidden layer neural network, the training objective function, up to a
certain approximation error, decreases by a multiplicative factor.
  On the flip side, we show that for training convex empirical risk minimizers
(ERM), dropout in fact acts as a ""stabilizer"" or regularizer. That is, a simple
dropout based GD method for convex ERMs is stable in the face of arbitrary
changes to any one of the training points. Using the above assertion, we show
that dropout provides fast rates for generalization error in learning (convex)
generalized linear models (GLM). Moreover, using the above mentioned stability
properties of dropout, we design dropout based differentially private
algorithms for solving ERMs. The learned GLM thus, preserves privacy of each of
the individual training points while providing accurate predictions for new
test points. Finally, we empirically validate our stability assertions for
dropout in the context of convex ERMs and show that surprisingly, dropout
significantly outperforms (in terms of prediction accuracy) the L2

YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$ (YBCO) pressure suppresses charge order, but does not
affect the pseudogap phase. This is based on transport measurements under
pressure, which reveal that the onset of the pseudogap at $T^*$ is independent
of pressure, while the negative Hall effect, a clear signature of CDW order in
YBCO, is suppressed by pressure. We also find that pressure and magnetic field
shift the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of YBCO in the
same way as a function of doping - but in opposite directions - and most
effectively at $p \simeq 0.12$. This shows that the competition between
superconductivity and CDW order can be tuned in two ways, either by suppressing
superconductivity with field or suppressing CDW order by pressure. Based on
existing high-pressure data and our own work, we observe that when CDW order is
fully suppressed at high pressure, the so-called ""1/8 anomaly"" in the
superconducting dome vanishes, revealing a smooth $T_{\rm c}$ dome which now
peaks at $p \simeq 0.13$. We propose that this $T_{\rm c}$ dome is shaped by

biophysics. It has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical polymer
physics; for realistic systems the quantitative understanding is however often
achievable only by computer simulations. In this study, we present the findings
of such extensive Monte-Carlo in silico experiments for polymer-surface
adsorption in confined domains. We study the inverted critical adsorption of
finite-length polyelectrolytes in three fundamental geometries: planar slit,
cylindrical pore, and spherical cavity. The scaling relations extracted from
simulations for the critical surface charge density $\sigma_c$-defining the
adsorption-desorption transition-are in excellent agreement with our analytical
calculations based on the ground-state analysis of the Edwards equation. In
particular, we confirm the magnitude and scaling of $\sigma_c$ for the concave
interfaces versus the Debye screening length $1/\kappa$ and the extent of
confinement $a$ for these three interfaces for small $\kappa a$ values. For
large $\kappa a$ the critical adsorption condition approaches the planar limit.
The transition between the two regimes takes place when the radius of surface
curvature or half of the slit thickness $a$ is of the order of $1/\kappa$. We
also rationalize how $\sigma_c(\kappa)$ gets modified for semi-flexible versus
flexible chains under external confinement. We examine the implications of the
chain length onto critical adsorption-the effect often hard to tackle
theoretically-putting an emphasis on polymers inside attractive spherical
cavities.

$C(60/100)$] of the dust emission. The latter probes the average intensity of
the dust heating radiation field and scales statistically with the effective
SFR surface density in star-forming galaxies including (ultra-)luminous

($L_{\rm CO\,(7-6)}$) to the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$; 8$-$1000
$\mu$m) are fairly tightly distributed (to within $\sim$0.12 dex) and show
little dependence on $C(60/100)$. This makes $L_{\rm CO\,(7-6)}$ a good SFR
tracer, which is less contaminated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) than $L_{\rm
IR}$ and may also be much less sensitive to metallicity than $L_{\rm
CO\,(1-0)}$. Furthermore, the logarithmic [NII] 205 $\mu$m to CO (7$-$6)
luminosity ratio is fairly steeply (at a slope of $\sim$$-1.4$) correlated with
$C(60/100)$, with a modest scatter ($\sim$0.23 dex). This makes it a useful
estimator on $C(60/100)$ with an implied uncertainty of $\sim$0.15 [or
$\lesssim$4 K in the dust temperature ($T_{\rm dust}$) in the case of a
graybody emission with $T_{\rm dust} \gtrsim 30$ K and a dust emissivity index
$\beta \ge 1$]. Our locally calibrated SFR and $C(60/100)$ estimators are shown
to be consistent with the published data of (U)LIRGs of $z$ up to $\sim$6.5.

scalar-tensor theories of gravity, a matter distribution around a black hole
can lead to the so called ""spontaneous scalarisation"" instability that triggers
the development of scalar hair. In the Brans-Dicke type theories, this effect
can be understood as a result of tachyonic effective mass of the scalar field.
Here we consider the instability in the generalised class of scalar-theories
that feature non-conformal, i.e. ""disformal"", couplings to matter. Such
theories have gained considerable interest in the recent years and have been
studied in a wide variety of systems, both cosmological and astrophysical. In
view of the prospects of gravitational wave astronomy, it is relevant to
explore the implications of the theories in the strong-gravity regime. In this

configurations around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. We find that in the
more generic scalar-tensor theories, the instability of the Brans-Dicke theory
can be enhanced, suggesting violations of the no-hair theorem. On the other
hand, we find that, especially if the coupling is very strong, or if the
gradients in the matter distribution are negligible, the disformal coupling
tends to stabilise the system.

color code with $d+1$ boundaries of $d+1$ distinct colors, we find that the
code is equivalent to multiple copies of the $d$-dimensional toric code which
are attached along a $(d-1)$-dimensional boundary. In particular, for $d=2$, we
show that the (triangular) color code with boundaries is equivalent to the
(folded) toric code with boundaries. We also find that the $d$-dimensional
toric code admits logical non-Pauli gates from the $d$-th level of the Clifford
hierarchy, and thus saturates the bound by Bravyi and K\""{o}nig. In particular,
we show that the $d$-qubit control-$Z$ logical gate can be fault-tolerantly
implemented on the stack of $d$ copies of the toric code by a local unitary
transformation.

a generic three dimensional metal in the presence of parallel electric ($E$)

theory of magnetotransport, this intrinsically quantum mechanical phenomenon
gives rise to the longitudinal magnetoresistance for any three dimensional

existence of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. We show this through an
explicit calculation of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in the quantum
limit using the Boltzmann equation, for both short-range neutral and long-range
ionic impurity scattering processes. We demonstrate that the ionic scattering
contributes a large positive magnetoconductivity $\propto B^2$ in the quantum
limit, which can cause a strong negative magnetoresistance for any three
dimensional or quasi-two dimensional metal. In contrast, the finite range
neutral impurities and zero range point impurities can lead to both positive
and negative longitudinal magnetoresistance depending on the underlying band
structure. In the presence of both neutral and ionic impurities, the
longitudinal magnetoresistance of a generic metal in the quantum limit
initially becomes negative, and ultimately becomes positive after passing
through a minimum. We discuss in detail the qualitative agreement between our

Galactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures are
seen in the thick disk. Our findings imply that the velocities of thick disk
stars should no longer be described by Schwarzschild's, multivariate Gaussian

reported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these could

the first stacked ultraviolet (rest-frame wavelengths 600-2500\AA) spectrum of
53 luminous quasars at z=2.4, with a state-of-the-art correction for the
intervening Lyman forest and Lyman continuum absorption. The continuum slope
($f_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha_\nu}$) of the full sample shows a break at ~912\AA\

softening at shorter wavelengths ($\alpha_\nu=-1.70 \pm 0.61$ at $\lambda\leq

correction is required to establish the intrinsic continuum emission of
quasars. We interpret our average ultraviolet spectrum in the context of
photoionisation, accretion disk models, and quasar contribution to the
ultraviolet background. We find that observed broad line ratios are consistent
with those predicted assuming an ionising slope of $\alpha_\mathrm{ion}=$-2.0,
similar to the observed ionising spectrum in the same wavelength range. The
continuum break and softening are consistent with accretion disk plus X-ray
corona models when black hole spin is taken into account. Our spectral energy

high [SII]6716/[SII]6761 and high [SII]6716/H$\alpha$, implying very low
electron densities (<30x lower than all other star-forming galaxies outside the
cluster) and significant contribution from supernovae, respectively. All
cluster star-forming galaxies near the cluster centre show evidence of
significant outflows (blueshifted Na D~200-300km/s), likely driven by
supernovae. Strong outflows are also found for the cluster H$\alpha$ AGN.
H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies in the merging cluster follow the z~0
mass-metallicity relation, showing systematically higher metallicity (~0.15-0.2
dex) than H$\alpha$ emitters outside the cluster (projected R>2.5 Mpc). This
suggests that the shock front may have triggered remaining metal-rich gas which
galaxies were able to retain into forming stars. Our observations show that the
merger of impressively massive (~10$^{15}$M$_\odot$) clusters can provide the
conditions for significant star-formation and AGN activity, but, as we witness
strong feedback by star-forming galaxies and AGN (and given how massive the

assume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we expect
them to share the same chemical composition. Most of the stellar aggregates are
disrupted while orbiting the Galaxy and most of the dynamic information is
lost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing the stellar formation history
is to analyze the chemical abundances that we observe today.
  Aims. The chemical tagging technique aims to recover disrupted stellar
clusters based merely on their chemical composition. We evaluate the viability
of this technique to recover co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationally
bound.
  Methods. Open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survive
together. We compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age open
clusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundance
species, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based on
their chemical composition. This approach allows us to evaluate the viability
and efficiency of the chemical tagging technique.
  Results. We found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinct
chemical patterns that may be due to NLTE effects, atomic diffusion, mixing,
and biases. When separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that a
few open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority show a
high degree of overlap. This limits the recovery of co-natal aggregates by
applying the chemical tagging technique. Nevertheless, there is room for
improvement if more elements are included and models are improved.

of the hierarchical growth of massive galaxies through mergers, and the
strongest sirens of gravitational waves (GWs) in the cosmos. And yet, their
direct detection has remained elusive due to the compact (sub-parsec) orbital
separations of gravitationally bound SMBHBs. Here we exploit a theoretically
predicted signature of a SMBHB in the time domain: periodic variability caused
by a mass accretion rate that is modulated by the binary's orbital motion. We
report our first significant periodically varying quasar detection from the
systematic search in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey. Our SMBHB
candidate, PSO J334.2028+01.4075, is a luminous radio-loud quasar at $z=2.060$,
with extended baseline photometry from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey,
as well as archival spectroscopy from the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey. The
observed period ($542 \pm 15$ days) and estimated black hole mass ($\log
(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) = 9.97 \pm 0.50$), correspond to an orbital separation of
$7^{+8}_{-4}$ Schwarzschild radii ($\sim 0.006^{+0.007}_{-0.003}$ pc), assuming
the rest-frame period of the quasar variability traces the orbital period of
the binary. This SMBHB candidate, discovered at the peak redshift for SMBH
mergers, is in a physically stable configuration for a circumbinary accretion
disk, and within the regime of GW-driven orbital decay. Our search with PS1 is
a benchmark study for the exciting capabilities of LSST, which will have orders
of magnitude larger survey power, and will potentially pinpoint the locations
of thousands of SMBHBs in the variable night sky.

absorption-line data from the COS-Halos Survey to absorption around a matched
galaxy sample from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The models
include different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybrid
energy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). We extract for
comparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors,
ion ratios, and kinematics. Both wind models are generally in good agreement
with these observations for HI and certain low ionization metal lines, but show
poorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including SiIII and OVI
that are well-observed by COS-Halos. These discrepancies suggest that both wind
models predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/or
that the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. This may reflect our model
assumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. Our ezw simulation
includes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heating
its ISM gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to be
broadly consistent with observations, but also substantial OVI absorption that
is inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in the
real Universe does not cool. At impact parameters of <50 kpc, recycling winds
dominate the absorption of low ions and even HI, while OVI almost always arises
from metals ejected longer than 1 Gyr ago. The similarity between the wind
models is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in their
predicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. We show that this
similarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather than
at fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that CGM properties
are more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.

optical-UV tracers of X-ray weakness; e.g., Fe II rest-frame equivalent width
and relative color. We describe how orientation effects under our previously
proposed ""shielding-gas"" scenario can likely unify the X-ray weak and X-ray
normal populations. We suggest that the shielding gas may naturally be
understood as a geometrically thick inner accretion disk that shields the broad
line region from the ionizing continuum. If WLQs and PHL 1811 analogs have very
high Eddington ratios, the inner disk could be significantly puffed up (e.g., a
slim disk). Shielding of the broad emission-line region by a geometrically
thick disk may have a significant role in setting the broad distributions of C

the evolution and survival of their binary stars. Our simulations show that
initial differences between the spatial distribution of first-generation (FG)

properties of the binary population. SG binaries are disrupted more efficiently
than those of the FG population resulting in a global SG binary fraction
smaller than that of the FG. As for surviving binaries, dynamical evolution
produces a difference between the SG and the FG binary binding energy
distribution with the SG population characterized by a larger fraction of high
binding energy (more bound) binaries. We have also studied the dependence of
the binary properties on the distance from the cluster centre. Although the
global binary fraction decreases more rapidly for the SG population, the local
binary fraction measured in the cluster inner regions may still be dominated by
SG binaries. The extent of the differences between the surviving FG and SG
binary binding energy distribution also varies radially within the cluster and
is larger in the cluster inner regions.

nonmesonic (NM) weak decay of hypernuclei. Instead of confronting the primary
decay rates, as is usually done, we focus attention on the effective decay
rates that are straightforwardly related with the number of emitted particles.
Proton kinetic energy spectra of $^5_\Lambda$He, $^7_\Lambda$Li,
$^9_\Lambda$Be, $^{11}_\Lambda$B, $^{12}_{\Lambda}$C, $^{13}_\Lambda$C,
$^{15}_{\Lambda}$N and $^{16}_{\Lambda}$O, measured by FINUDA, are evaluated
theoretically. The Independent Particle Shell Model (IPSM) is used as the
nuclear structure framework, while the dynamics is described by the
One-Meson-Exchange (OME) potential. Only for the $^{5}_{\Lambda}$He,
$^{7}_{\Lambda}$Li, and $^{12}_{\Lambda}$C hypernuclei is it possible to make a
comparison with the data, since for the rest there is no published experimental
information on number of produced hypernuclei. Considering solely the
one-nucleon-induced ($1N$-NM) decay channel, the theory reproduces correctly
the shapes of all three spectra at medium and high energies ($E_p \geq 40 $
MeV). Yet, it greatly overestimates their magnitudes, as well as the
corresponding transition rates when the full OME ($\pi+K+
\eta+\rho+\omega+K^*$) model is used. The agreement is much improved when only
the $\pi+K$ mesons with soft dipole cutoff parameters participate in the decay
process. We find that the IPSM is a fair first order approximation to
disentangle the dynamics of the $1N$-NM decay, the knowledge of which is
indispensable to inquire about the baryon-baryon strangeness-flipping
interaction. It is shown that the IPSM provides very useful insights regarding
the determination the $2N$-NM decay rate. In a new analysis of the FINUDA data,
we derive two results for this quantity with one of them close to that obtained
previously.

Graphical procedures, such as the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, are arguably
the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find
their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness-of-fit tests are
available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of
fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this paper we explore the use of the
lineup protocol to inject rigor to graphical distributional assessment and
compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineups
of standard Q-Q plots are more powerful than lineups of de-trended Q-Q plots

years at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m telescope. Of the 238 red dwarfs within 25 pc, we

the VRI bands. We find that high variability at optical wavelengths over the
long-term can be used to identify young stars. Overall, however, the fluxes of
most red dwarfs at optical wavelengths are steady to a few percent over the
long term. The low overall rate of photometric variability for red dwarfs is
consistent with results found in previous work on similar stars on shorter
timescales, with the body of work indicating that most red dwarfs are only
mildly variable. We highlight 17 stars that show long-term changes in

  Decomposition",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze stochastic gradient descent for optimizing non-convex functions.
In many cases for non-convex functions the goal is to find a reasonable local
minimum, and the main concern is that gradient updates are trapped in saddle
points. In this paper we identify strict saddle property for non-convex problem
that allows for efficient optimization. Using this property we show that
stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number
of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives
global convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex
functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. Our analysis
can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in
learning a rich class of latent variable models. We propose a new optimization
formulation for the tensor decomposition problem that has strict saddle
property. As a result we get the first online algorithm for orthogonal tensor
decomposition with global convergence guarantee.

billions of years ago, even though plenty of hot gas remains available for star

star formation depends on both black-hole feedback and Type Ia supernova
heating. We analyze Chandra X-ray observations of ten massive ellipticals, five
with extended, potentially star-forming multiphase gas and five single-phase
ellipticals with no star formation. The ratio of cooling time to freefall time
at 1--10 kpc in the multiphase galaxies is tc/tff ~10, indicating that
precipitation-driven feedback limits cooling but does not eliminate
condensation. In the same region of the single-phase galaxies, the radial
profiles of gas entropy are consistent with a thermally stable (tc/tff > 20)
supernova-driven outflow that sweeps stellar ejecta out of the galaxy. However,
in one of those single-phase ellipticals (NGC 4261) we find tc/tff < 10 at <
300 pc. Notably, its jets are ~50 times more powerful than in the other nine
ellipticals, in agreement with models indicating that precipitation near the
black hole should switch its fueling mode from Bondi-like accretion to cold
chaotic accretion. We conclude by hypothesizing that particularly strong
black-hole outbursts can shut off star formation in massive elliptical galaxies
by boosting the entropy of the hot gas and flipping the system into the
supernova-sweeping state.

for every $n \ge |V(H)|$, there exists an $n$-vertex graph that is
$H$-saturated, the same does not hold for induced subgraphs. That is, there
exist graphs $H$ and values of $n \ge |V(H)|$ for which every $n$-vertex graph
$G$ either contains $H$ as an induced subgraph, or there exists $e \notin E(G)$
such that $G + e$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. To circumvent
this, Martin and Smith make use of trigraphs when introducing the concept of
induced saturation and the induced saturation number of graphs. This allows for
edges that can be included or excluded when searching for an induced copy of H,
and the induced saturation number is the minimum number of such edges that are
required.
  In this paper, we show that the induced saturation number of many common
graphs is zero. Consequently, this yields graphs, instead of trigraphs, that
are H-induced-saturated. We introduce a new parameter for such graphs,
indsat*(n;H), which is the minimum number of edges in an H-induced-saturated

particular, we determine indsat*(n;paw) completely, and indsat*(n;$K_{1,3}$)

of the $(M)$-estimator for location with score function $\psi$, and
$I(F_\epsilon^*)$ is the minimal Fisher information $ \min_{{\cal F}_\epsilon}

  We consider the linear regression model $Y = X\theta_0 + W$,
$W_i\sim_{\text{i.i.d.}}F$, and iid Normal predictors $X_{i,j}$, working in the
high-dimensional-limit asymptotic where the number $n$ of observations and $p$
of variables both grow large, while $n/p \rightarrow m \in (1,\infty)$; hence
$m$ plays the role of `asymptotic number of observations per parameter

the $(M)$-estimator of regression in the $n/p \rightarrow m$ regime. Then $V_m
\neq V$; however $V_m \rightarrow V$ as $m \rightarrow \infty$.
  In this paper we evaluate the minimax asymptotic variance of the Huber
$(M)$-estimate. The statistician minimizes over the family
$(\psi_\lambda)_{\lambda > 0}$ of all tunings of Huber $(M)$-estimates of
regression, and Nature maximizes over gross-error contaminations $F \in {\cal

\max_{F \in {\cal F}_\epsilon} V_m(\psi_\lambda, F) = \frac{1}{I(F_\epsilon^*)
- 1/m} $. Strikingly, if $I(F_\epsilon^*) \cdot m \leq 1$, then the minimax
asymptotic variance is $+\infty$. The breakdown point is where the Fisher

[Fe/H], starting with $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at
[$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0$ and [Fe/H]$\sim+0.4$. At larger radii we find two distinct
sequences in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-$\alpha$
sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-$\alpha$ sequence that
merges with the low-$\alpha$ sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The location of
the high-$\alpha$ sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however there
are very few high-$\alpha$ stars at $R>11$ kpc. The peak of the midplane MDF
shifts to lower metallicity at larger $R$, reflecting the Galactic metallicity
gradient. Most strikingly, the shape of the midplane MDF changes systematically
with radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at $3<R<7$ kpc, to a roughly
Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in the
outer Galaxy. For stars with $|z|>1$ kpc or [$\alpha$/Fe]$>0.18$, the MDF shows
little dependence on $R$. The positive skewness of the outer disk MDF may be a
signature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations by

simple model of radial migration can do so.

into its fundamental equations, simply by postulating their existence and
properties, just as it postulates the existence and properties of electric
charges and currents. Maxwell's macroscopic equations are mathematically exact
and self-consistent differential equations that relate the electromagnetic (EM)
field to its sources, namely, electric charge-density $\rho_{free}$, electric
current-density $J_{free}$, polarization P, and magnetization M. At the level
of Maxwell's macroscopic equations, there is no need for models of electric and
magnetic dipoles. For example, whether a magnetic dipole is an Amperian
current-loop or a Gilbertian pair of north and south magnetic monopoles has no
effect on the solution of Maxwell's equations.
  Electromagnetic fields carry energy as well as linear and angular momenta,
which they can exchange with material media - the seat of the sources of the EM
field - thereby exerting force and torque on these media. In the Lorentz
formulation of classical electrodynamics, the electric and magnetic fields, E
and B, exert forces and torques on electric charge and current distributions.
An electric dipole is then modeled as a pair of electric charges on a stick (or
spring), and a magnetic dipole is modeled as an Amperian current loop, so that
the Lorentz force law can be applied to the corresponding (bound) charges and
(bound) currents of these dipoles. In contrast, the Einstein-Laub formulation
circumvents the need for specific models of the dipoles by simply providing a
recipe for calculating the force-density and torque-density exerted by the E
and H fields on charge, current, polarization and magnetization.

represent open quantum harmonic oscillators modelled by linear quantum
stochastic differential equations. The interconnections between the plant and
the controller are assumed to be established through quantum bosonic fields. In
this framework, conditions for the stabilization of a given linear quantum
plant via linear coherent quantum feedback are addressed using a stable
factorization approach. The class of stabilizing quantum controllers is
parameterized in the frequency domain. Also, this approach is used in order to
formulate coherent quantum weighted $H_2$ and $H_\infty$ control problems for
linear quantum systems in the frequency domain. Finally, a projected gradient
descent scheme is proposed to solve the coherent quantum weighted $H_2$ control
problem.

offers an alternative to the current IP\nobreakdash-based Internet

(content) instead of communication endpoints. One important open issue in ICN
is whether negative acknowledgments (NACKs) at the network layer are useful for
notifying downstream nodes about forwarding failures, or requests for incorrect
or non-existent information. In benign settings, NACKs are beneficial for ICN
architectures, such as CCNx and NDN, since they flush state in routers and
notify consumers. In terms of security, NACKs seem useful as they can help
mitigating so-called Interest Flooding attacks. However, as we show in this
paper, network-layer NACKs also have some unpleasant security implications. We
consider several types of NACKs and discuss their security design requirements
and implications. We also demonstrate that providing secure NACKs triggers the
threat of producer-bound flooding attacks. Although we discuss some potential
countermeasures to these attacks, the main conclusion of this paper is that
network-layer NACKs are best avoided, at least for security reasons.

obtaining a root-mean-square scatter of order sub-millimagnitude over several

observations with the telescope operated in in-focus mode. High photometric
precision is obtained due to the collection of a larger amount of photons
resulting in a higher signal compared to other random and systematic noise
sources. Accurate telescope tracking is likely to further contribute to
lowering systematic noise by probing the same pixels on the CCD. Furthermore, a
longer exposure time helps reducing the effect of scintillation noise which
otherwise has a significant effect for small-aperture telescopes operated in
in-focus mode. Finally we present the results of modelling four light-curves

Nevertheless, the high phononic contribution to the thermal conductance
strongly suppresses $ZT$. Our work demonstrates the importance to include the
phonon thermal conductance for any realistic estimate of the $ZT$ for

quantum gravity. First, we review on our previous work of a canonical
quantization for a spherically symmetric geometry where one of the spatial
coordinates is treated as the time variable, since we think of the interior
region of a black hole. Based on this formalism, under physically plausible
assumptions, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation inside the black hole, and
show that the mass-loss rate of an evaporating black hole due to thermal
radiation is equivalent to the result obtained by Hawking in his semi-classical
approach. A remarkable point is that our assumptions make the momentum
constraint coincide with the Hamiltonian constraint up to an irrelevant overall
factor. Furthermore, for comparison, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation
outside the black hole as well, and see that the mass-loss rate of an
evaporating black hole has the same expression. The present analysis suggests
that the black hole radiation comes from the black hole singularity. We also
comment on the Birkhoff theorem in quantum gravity.

learning strategies. However, as is well known, the choices of the degree of
polynomial kernel and the regularization parameter are still open in the realm
of model selection. The first aim of this paper is to develop a strategy to
select these parameters. On one hand, based on the worst-case learning rate
analysis, we show that the regularization term in polynomial kernel regression
is not necessary. In other words, the regularization parameter can decrease
arbitrarily fast when the degree of the polynomial kernel is suitable tuned. On
the other hand,taking account of the implementation of the algorithm, the
regularization term is required. Summarily, the effect of the regularization
term in polynomial kernel regression is only to circumvent the "" ill-condition""
of the kernel matrix. Based on this, the second purpose of this paper is to
propose a new model selection strategy, and then design an efficient learning
algorithm. Both theoretical and experimental analysis show that the new
strategy outperforms the previous one. Theoretically, we prove that the new
learning strategy is almost optimal if the regression function is smooth.
Experimentally, it is shown that the new strategy can significantly reduce the
computational burden without loss of generalization capability.

Contrary to the static/stationary channel regime, there is no optimal power
allocation profile to target (either static or in the mean), so the system's
users must adapt to changes in the environment ""on the fly"", without being able
to predict the system's evolution ahead of time. In this dynamic context, we
formulate the users' power/throughput trade-off as an online optimization
problem and we provide a matrix exponential learning algorithm that leads to no
regret - i.e. the proposed transmit policy is asymptotically optimal in
hindsight, irrespective of how the system evolves over time. Furthermore, we
also examine the robustness of the proposed algorithm under imperfect channel
state information (CSI) and we show that it retains its regret minimization
properties under very mild conditions on the measurement noise statistics. As a
result, users are able to track the evolution of their individually optimum

diagrammatic expansion for the self-energy which guarantees the positivity of
the spectral function. In this work we extend the theory to the density
response function. We write the generic diagram for the density-response
spectrum as the sum of partitions. In a partition the original diagram is
evaluated using time-ordered Green's functions (GF) on the left-half of the
diagram, antitime-ordered GF on the right-half of the diagram and lesser or
greater GF gluing the two halves. As there exist more than one way to cut a
diagram in two halves, to every diagram corresponds more than one partition. We
recognize that the most convenient diagrammatic objects for constructing a
theory of positive spectra are the half-diagrams. Diagrammatic approximations
obtained by summing the squares of half-diagrams do indeed correspond to a
combination of partitions which, by construction, yield a positive spectrum. We
develop the theory using bare GF and subsequently extend it to dressed GF. We
further prove a connection between the positivity of the spectral function and
the analytic properties of the polarizability. The general theory is
illustrated with several examples and then applied to solve the long-standing
problem of including vertex corrections without altering the positivity of the
spectrum. In fact already the first-order vertex diagram, relevant to the study
of gradient expansion, Friedel oscillations, etc., leads to spectra which are
negative in certain frequency domain. We find that the simplest approximation
to cure this deficiency is given by the sum of the zero-th order bubble
diagram, the first-order vertex diagram and a partition of the second-order
ladder diagram. We evaluate this approximation in the 3D homogeneous electron
gas and show the positivity of the spectrum for all frequencies and densities.

recovery in noiseless case and a tighter non-asymptotic upper bound of estimate
error in noisy case. We further prove that the nonconvex $\ell_q$-analysis
optimization can do recovery with a lower sample complexity and in a wider
range of cosparsity than its convex counterpart. In addition, we develop an
iteratively reweighted method to solve the optimization problem under the
variational framework. Theoretical analysis shows that our method is capable of
pursuing a local minima close to the global minima. Also, empirical results of
preliminary computational experiments illustrate that our nonconvex method
outperforms both its convex counterpart and other state-of-the-art methods.

  overlap with arXiv:1306.5169",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reactions induced by high energy antiprotons on proton on nuclei are
accompanied with large probability by the emission of a few mesons. Interesting
phenomena can be observed and QCD tests can be performed, through the detection
of one or more mesons. The collinear emission from high energy (anti)proton
beams of a hard pion or vector meson, can be calculated similarly to the
emission of a hard photon from an electron \cite{Kuraev:2013izz}. This is a
well known process in QED, and it is called the ""Quasi-Real Electron method"",
where the incident particle is an electron and a hard photon is emitted leaving
an 'almost on shell' electron impinging on the target \cite{Baier:1973ms}. Such
process is well known as Initial State Emission (ISR) method of scanning over
incident energy, and can be used, in the hadron case, to produce different kind
of particles in similar kinematical conditions. In case of emission of a
charged light meson, $\pi$ or $\rho$-meson, in proton-proton(anti-proton)
collisions, the meson can be deviated in a magnetic field and detected. The
collinear emission (along the beam direction) of a charged meson may be used to
produce high energy (anti)neutron beams. This can be very useful to measure the
difference of the cross sections of (anti)proton and (anti)neutron scattering
from the target and may open the way for checking sum rules with antiparticles.
Hard meson emission allows also to enhance the cross section when the energy
loss from one of the incident particles lowers the total energy up to the mass
of a resonance. The cross section can be calculated, on the basis of factorized
formulas, where the probability of emission of the light mesons multiplies the
cross section of the sub-process. Multiplicity distributions for neutral and
charged meson production are also given.

(necessary and sufficient condition) for contextuality in a broad class of
quantum systems. This class includes Leggett-Garg, EPR/Bell, and
Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky type systems as special cases. In a system of
this class certain physical properties $q_{1},...,q_{n}$ are measured in pairs
$(q_{i},q_{j})$; every property enters in precisely two such pairs; and each
measurement outcome is a binary random variable. Denoting the measurement
outcomes for a property $q_{i}$ in the two pairs it enters by $V_{i}$ and
$W_{i}$, the pair of measurement outcomes for $(q_{i},q_{j})$ is
$(V_{i},W_{j})$. Contextuality is defined as follows: one computes the minimal
possible value $\Delta_{0}$ for the sum of $\Pr[V_{i}\not=W_{i}]$ (over
$i=1,...,n$) that is allowed by the individual distributions of $V_{i}$ and
$W_{i}$; one computes the minimal possible value $\Delta_{\min}$ for the sum of
$\Pr[V_{i}\not=W_{i}]$ across all possible couplings of (i.e., joint
distributions imposed on) the entire set of random variables
$V_{1},W_{1},...,V_{n},W_{n}$ in the system; and the system is considered
contextual if $\Delta_{\min}>\Delta_{0}$ (otherwise
$\Delta_{\min}=\Delta_{0}$). This definition has its justification in the
general approach dubbed Contextuality-by-Default, and it allows for measurement
errors and signaling among the measured properties. The conjecture proved in
this paper specifies the value of $\Delta_{\min}-\Delta_{0}$ in terms of the
distributions of the measurement outcomes $(V_{i},W_{j})$.

One of the main difficulties with these vectors of categorical variables is
sparsity. The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector
length, but dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have
gained significant improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models
embed observations in a continuous space to capture similarities between them.
Building on these ideas we propose a Bayesian model for the unsupervised task
of distribution estimation of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors
of categorical variables as generated from a non-linear transformation of a
continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality in the
distribution. The continuous representation addresses sparsity. Our model ties
together many existing models, linking the linear categorical latent Gaussian
model, the Gaussian process latent variable model, and Gaussian process
classification. We derive inference for our model based on recent developments
in sampling based variational inference. We show empirically that the model
outperforms its linear and discrete counterparts in imputation tasks of sparse

of the Earth. The depth of oscillations is about $(0.1 - 0.2)\%$ and the length
$\approx 30$ km. The period of the oscillatory modulations in the energy scale
is comparable with the width of the line determined by the temperature in the
center of the Sun. The latter means that depending on the length of trajectory
(nadir angle) one obtains different degree of averaging of oscillations.
Exploring these oscillations it is possible to measure the width of the $^7$Be
line and therefore the temperature of the Sun, determine precisely $\Delta
m^2_{21}$, perform tomography of the Earth, in particular, measure the
deviation of its form from sphere, and detect small structures. Studies of the
Be neutrinos open up a possibility to test quantum mechanics of neutrino
oscillations and search for the sterile neutrinos. Accuracy of these
measurements with future scintillator (or scintillator uploaded) detectors of
the $\sim 100$ kton mass scale is estimated.

the thermalization time as well as an anisotropy accelerates the

a correlation between solar particle events and congenital malformations. In
this work we use the results of computational simulations to approximate the
ionizing radiation from such events as well as longer term increases in cosmic
ray flux. We find that the amounts of ionizing radiation produced by these
events are insufficient to produce congenital malformations under the current

muons. We suggest that more extensive measurements of muon radiation effects

completeness, we give a brief outline of the canonical proper-time approach to
electrodynamics and mechanics, and then introduce the canonical proper-time
approach to relativistic quantum theory. This theory leads to three new
relativistic wave equations. In each case, the canonical generator of
proper-time translations is strictly positive definite, so that it represents a

experimental data, when compared to the Dirac equation. However, these results
are not sufficient to account for either the Lamb shift or the anomalous

achieve sub-meter accuracy in the short/medium period. However, when low-cost
inertial measurement units (IMU) are employed for their implementation, they
suffer from a slowly growing drift between the true pedestrian position and the
corresponding estimated position. In this paper we illustrate a novel solution
to mitigate such a drift by: a) using only accelerometer and gyroscope
measurements (no magnetometers required); b) including the sensor error model
parameters in the state vector of an extended Kalman filter; c) adopting a
novel soft heuristic for foot stance detection and for zero-velocity updates.
Experimental results evidence that our inertial-only navigation system can
achieve similar or better performance with respect to pedestrian dead-reckoning
systems presented in related studies, although the adopted IMU is less accurate
than more expensive counterparts.
