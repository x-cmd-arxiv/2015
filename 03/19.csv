radiation-hydrodynamics, 1-D non-LTE radiative transfer, and 2-D polarised
radiative transfer for super-luminous interacting supernovae (SNe). Our
reference model is a ~10Msun inner shell with 10^51erg ramming into a ~3Msun
cold outer shell (the circumstellar-medium, or CSM) that extends from 10^15cm
to 2x10^16cm and moves at 100km/s. We discuss the light curve evolution, which
cannot be captured adequately with a grey approach. In these interactions, the
shock-crossing time through the optically-thick CSM is much longer than the
photon diffusion time. Radiation is thus continuously leaking from the shock
through the CSM, in disagreement with the shell-shocked model that is often
invoked. Our spectra redden with time, with a peak distribution in the near-UV
during the first month gradually shifting to the optical range over the
following year. Initially Balmer lines exhibit a narrow line core and the broad
line wings that are characteristic of electron scattering in the SNe IIn
atmospheres (CSM). At later times they also exhibit a broad blue shifted
component which arises from the cold dense shell. Our model results are broadly
consistent with the bolometric light curve and spectral evolution observed for
SN2010jl. Invoking a prolate pole-to-equator density ratio in the CSM, we can
also reproduce the ~2% continuum polarisation, and line depolarisation,
observed in SN2010jl. By varying the inner shell kinetic energy and the mass
and extent of the outer shell, a large range of peak luminosities and
durations, broadly compatible with super-luminous SNe IIn like 2010jl or
2006gy, can be produced.

parallelization of this algorithm and also present the parallelization of
structured matrix-vector product, structured factorization and solution

different academic and industrial applications, on up to 8,000 cores.

completely determined by its coarse space $X$ and the ramification divisor (on

adaptive Low Rank (LR) filters used in target detection embedded in a

this context, we use the Signal to Interference to Noise Ratio (SINR) loss as
performance measure which is a function of the estimated projector onto the LR
noise subspace. However, although the SINR loss can be determined through
Monte-Carlo simulations or real data, this process remains quite time
consuming. Thus, this paper proposes to predict the SINR loss behavior in order
to not depend on the data anymore and be quicker. To derive this theoretical
result, previous works used a restrictive hypothesis assuming that the target
is orthogonal to the LR noise. In this paper, we propose to derive this
theoretical performance by relaxing this hypothesis and using Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) tools. These tools will be used to present the convergences of
simple quadratic forms and perform new RMT convergences of structured quadratic
forms and SINR loss in the large dimensional regime, i.e. the size and the
number of the data tend to infinity at the same rate. We show through
simulations the interest of our approach compared to the previous works when
the restrictive hypothesis is no longer verified.

initiated by cosmic-gamma rays or cosmic rays entering the Earth's atmosphere.
From the combination of images the Cherenkov light produces in the telescopes,
one is able to infer the primary particle energy and direction. A correct
energy estimation can be thus performed only if the local atmosphere is well
characterized. The atmosphere not only affects the shower development itself,
but also the Cherenkov photon transmission from the emission point in the
particle shower, at about 10-20 km above the ground, to the detector. Cherenkov
light on the ground is peaked in the UV-blue region, and therefore molecular
and aerosol extinction phenomena are important. The goal of CTA is to control
systematics in energy reconstruction to better than 10%. For this reason, a
careful and continuous monitoring and characterization of the atmosphere is
required. In addition, CTA will be operated as an observatory, with data made

stainless steel sheets were obtained, exhibiting high contact angle values
($154^{\circ}$) and high adhesion force (high contact angle hysteresis).
Furthermore, the investigation of MWCNT films at scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) reveals a two-fold hierarchical morphology of the MWCNT random networks
made of hydrophilic carbonaceous nanostructures on the tip of hydrophobic
MWCNTs. Owing to the Salvinia effect, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic composite
surface of the MWCNT films supplies a stationary super-hydrophobic coating for
conductive stainless steel. This biomimetical inspired surface not only may
prevent corrosion and fouling but also could provide low-friction and

The data reveal multiple signatures of molecular and atomic gas that has been
kinematically distorted by the passage of the jet plasma or cocoon within an
area of ~1 kpc^2. Concrete evidence that the interaction of the jet with the
gas causes the gas to accelerate comes from the detection of outflows in four
different regions along the jet trail: near the two radio lobes, between the
radio emission tip and the optical narrow-line-region cone, and at a region
with diffuse 17.8 GHz emission midway between the nucleus and the north radio
lobe. The outflow in the latter region is biconical, centered 240 pc away from
the nucleus, and oriented perpendicularly to the jet trail. The diffuse
emission that is observed as a result of the gas entrainment or scattering
unfolds around the trail and away from the nucleus with increasing velocity. It
overall extends for >700 pc parallel and perpendicular to the trail. Near the
outflow starting points, the gas has a velocity excess of 600 km/s to 1200 km/s

colliders, operating in two different beam modes, namely, $e^+e^-$ and
$e^-e^-$. In the $e^+e^-$ beam mode, we consider various production and decay
modes of the heavy neutrino ($N$), and find that the final state with
$e+2j+{E\!\!\!/}_T$, arising from the $e^+e^-\to N\nu$ production mode, is the
most promising channel. However, since this mode is insensitive to the Majorana
nature of the heavy neutrinos, we also study a new production channel
$e^+e^-\to Ne^\pm W^\mp$, which leads to a same-sign dilepton plus four jet
final state, thus directly probing the lepton number violation in $e^+e^-$
colliders. In the $e^-e^-$ beam mode, we study the prospects of the lepton
number violating process of $e^-e^-\to W^-W^-$, mediated by a heavy Majorana
neutrino. We use both cut-based and multivariate analysis techniques to make a
realistic calculation of the relevant signal and background events, including
detector effects for a generic linear collider detector. We find that with the
cut-based analysis, the light-heavy neutrino mixing parameter $|V_{eN}|^2$ can
be probed down to $\sim 10^{-4}$ at 95\% C.L. for the heavy neutrino mass up to
$400$ GeV or so at $\sqrt s=500$ GeV with $100 \rm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity. For smaller mixing values, we show that a multivariate analysis can
improve the signal significance by up to an order of magnitude. These limits
will be at least an order of magnitude better than the current best limits from
electroweak precision data, as well as the projected limits from $\sqrt s=14$

microwave bands, it is important to properly discriminate the weak rainfall
signals from strong and highly variable background surface emission.
Traditionally, land rainfall retrieval methods often rely on a weak signal of
rainfall scattering on high-frequency channels (85 GHz) and make use of
empirical thresholding and regression-based techniques. Due to the increased
ground surface signal interference, precipitation retrieval over
radiometrically complex land surfaces, especially over snow-covered lands,
deserts and coastal areas, is of particular challenge for this class of
retrieval techniques. This paper evaluates the results by the recently proposed
Shrunken locally linear embedding Algorithm for Retrieval of Precipitation
(ShARP), over a radiometrically complex terrain and coastal areas using the
data provided by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. To
this end, the ShARP retrieval experiments are performed over a region in
Southeast Asia, partly covering the Tibetan Highlands, Himalayas,
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basins and its delta. We elucidate promising
results by ShARP over snow covered land surfaces and at the vicinity of
coastlines, in comparison with the land rainfall retrievals of the standard
TRMM-2A12 product. Specifically, using the TRMM-2A25 radar product as a
reference, we provide evidence that the ShARP algorithm can significantly
reduce the rainfall over estimation due to the background snow contamination
and markedly improve detection and retrieval of rainfall at the vicinity of
coastlines. During the calendar year 2013, we demonstrate that over the study
domain the root mean squared difference can be reduced up to 38% annually,
while the reduction can reach up to 70% during the cold months.

identifying the basic units which build up the system and 2) introducing the
new feature to each of these basic units.
  In the case where the system is argumentation and the feature is
probabilistic we have the following. The basic units are: a. the nature of the
arguments involved; b. the membership relation in the set S of arguments; c.
the attack relation; and d. the choice of extensions.
  Generically to add a new aspect (probabilistic, or fuzzy, or temporal, etc)
to an argumentation network <S,R> can be done by adding this feature to each
component a-d. This is a brute-force method and may yield a non-intuitive or
meaningful result.
  A better way is to meaningfully translate the object system into another
target system which does have the aspect required and then let the target
system endow the aspect on the initial system. In our case we translate
argumentation into classical propositional logic and get probabilistic
argumentation from the translation.
  Of course what we get depends on how we translate.

networks. We then compare our semantics with existing proposals in the

data, researchers and urban planners can detect many aspects of how people live
in cities and can also suggest how to transform cities into more efficient and
smarter places to live in. In particular, their digital trails can be used to
investigate tastes of individuals, and what attracts them to live in a
particular city or to spend their vacation there. In this paper we propose an
unconventional way to study how people experience the city, using information
from geotagged photographs that people take at different locations. We compare
the spatial behavior of residents and tourists in 10 most photographed cities
all around the world. The study was conducted on both a global and local level.
On the global scale we analyze the 10 most photographed cities and measure how
attractive each city is for people visiting it from other cities within the
same country or from abroad. For the purpose of our analysis we construct the
users mobility network and measure the strength of the links between each pair
of cities as a level of attraction of people living in one city (i.e., origin)
to the other city (i.e., destination). On the local level we study the spatial
distribution of user activity and identify the photographed hotspots inside
each city. The proposed methodology and the results of our study are a low cost
mean to characterize a touristic activity within a certain location and can
help in urban organization to strengthen their touristic potential.

Hecke operators acting on the space of cusp forms (\cite{5}, \cite{6}).
Actually, it is an expression in terms of an integral over a fundamental domain
of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}).$ His theorem tells us that if $f$ is a cusp form of
weight $k$, then we can identify the Peterson scalar product of $f$ and a
certain series $\omega_m(z_1,\bar{z_2}, k)$ with the action of the Hecke
operator $T(m)$ on the function $f$, up to a constant that depends only on $k$
and $m$. It follows that $\omega_m(z_1,\bar{z_2}, k)$ is kind of ""kernel
function"" for the operator $T(m)$.
  Don Zagier proved this theorem using the Rankin-Selberg method. Other
evidence was proposed by prof. A. Levin. He suggested to construct a Cauchy
kernel. Formally, the Cauchy kernel expressed by the series, which doesn't
converge absolutely. The main purpose of this paper is to extend this series to
the edge of convergence by analytic continuation. The second part of the paper
is devoted to getting an expression for differential form of logarithm of

coefficients to an accuracy of approximately 1%. There are two main methods of
determining free flight drag coefficients, or equivalent ballistic
coefficients: 1) measuring near and far velocities over a known distance and 2)
measuring a near velocity and time of flight over a known distance. Atmospheric
conditions must also be known and nearly constant over the flight path. A
number of tradeoffs are important when designing experiments to accurately
determine drag coefficients. The flight distance must be large enough so that
the projectile's loss of velocity is significant compared with its initial
velocity and much larger than the uncertainty in the near and/or far velocity
measurements. On the other hand, since drag coefficients and ballistic
coefficients both depend on velocity, the change in velocity over the flight
path should be small enough that the average drag coefficient over the path
(which is what is really determined) is a reasonable approximation to the value
of drag coefficient at the near and far velocity. This paper considers these
tradeoffs as well as practical considerations for obtaining accurate near and
far velocity measurements and the impact of different sources of error
(velocity, distance, time, atmospheric conditions, etc.) on the resulting
accuracy of drag coefficients and ballistic coefficients. For a given level of
accuracy of various quantities, the method of using near and far velocities
usually produces drag coefficients with about half the uncertainty of the
method using a near velocity and time of flight.

been recognized that mixing phenomena can also be nonlinear. The corresponding
nonlinear analysis techniques are necessarily more challenging and complex than
those employed for linear unmixing. Within this context, it makes sense to
detect the nonlinearly mixed pixels in an image prior to its analysis, and then
employ the simplest possible unmixing technique to analyze each pixel. In this
paper, we propose a technique for detecting nonlinearly mixed pixels. The
detection approach is based on the comparison of the reconstruction errors
using both a Gaussian process regression model and a linear regression model.
The two errors are combined into a detection statistics for which a probability
density function can be reasonably approximated. We also propose an iterative
endmember extraction algorithm to be employed in combination with the detection
algorithm. The proposed Detect-then-Unmix strategy, which consists of
extracting endmembers, detecting nonlinearly mixed pixels and unmixing, is

Manufacturers collect large amount of engine related data during flights which

introduces and studies a generic methodology that allows one to build automatic
early signs of anomaly detection in a way that builds upon human expertise and
that remains understandable by human operators who make the final maintenance

binary indicators based on parametric anomaly scores designed by experts,
complemented by simple aggregations of those scores. A feature selection method
is used to keep only the most discriminant indicators which are used as inputs
of a Naive Bayes classifier. This give an interpretable classifier based on
interpretable anomaly detectors whose parameters have been optimized indirectly
by the selection process. The proposed methodology is evaluated on simulated
data designed to reproduce some of the anomaly types observed in real world
engines.

Advanced image and video editing techniques are increasingly common in the
image processing and computer vision world, and are also starting to be used in
media entertainment. One common and difficult task closely linked to the world
of video editing is image and video "" inpainting "". Generally speaking, this is
the task of replacing the content of an image or video with some other content
which is visually pleasing. This subject has been extensively studied in the
case of images, to such an extent that commercial image inpainting products
destined for the general public are available, such as Photoshop's "" Content
Aware fill "" [1]. However, while some impressive results have been obtained in
the case of videos, the subject has been studied far less extensively than
image inpainting. This relative lack of research can largely be attributed to
high time complexity due to the added temporal dimension. Indeed, it has only
very recently become possible to produce good quality inpainting results on
high definition videos, and this only in a semi-automatic manner. Nevertheless,
high-quality video inpainting has many important and useful applications such
as film restoration, professional post-production in cinema and video editing
for personal use. For this reason, we believe that an automatic, generic video
inpainting algorithm would be extremely useful for both academic and
professional communities.

of related regular polygons. These families arise naturally in the study of
piecewise rotations such as outer billiards. In some cases they exist on all
scales and can be used to define the fractal dimension of the 'singularity
set'. This is well-documented for regular N-gons such as the pentagon, octagon
and dodecagon, whose algebraic complexity is 'quadratic' (EulerPhi[N]/2 = 2).
  Recent evidence suggests that the geometry of these families is intrinsic to
the 'parent' polygon and can be derived independently of any mapping. It is the
purpose of this paper to show how the First Family for any regular polygon
arises naturally from the geometry of the 'star polygons' first studied by
Thomas Bradwardine (1290-1349).
  The nucleus of the First Family are the S[k] 'tiles'. Each S[k] tile has a
corresponding 'star-point' sk = tan(kPi/N) and a matching scale. Based on a
1949 result by C.Siegel and S.Chowla, the primitive scales with gcd(k,N) = 1
form a unit basis for the maximal real subfield of the cyclotomic field of N.
Traditionally, this subfield has been the source of scaling and rotational
parameters for affine piecewise rational rotations, and our results show that
the First Family scaling can serve as a 'natural' basis for such investigations
- which include the outer billiards map.

this result. We compute the Casimir energy for such theories by reducing to a
problem in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. For the round cylinder the vacuum
energy is proportional to $a+3c$. We also compute the dependence of the Casimir
energy on the squashing parameter of the cylinder. Finally, we revisit the

channels in the nondegenerate extended Hubbard model with intersite Coulomb and
exchange interactions. To this aim we use the spin rotationally invariant slave
boson approach and we determine the necessary inverse propagator matrix. The
analytically derived spin Landau parameter $F_0^a$ for the half filled band
uncovers the intrinsic instability of the nondegenerate Hubbard model towards
ferromagnetism --- negative intersite exchange interaction triggers a
ferromagnetic instability at half filling before the metal-insulator
transition, indicated by the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility at
$F_0^a=-1$. This result is general and the instability occurs in the strongly
correlated metallic regime for any lattice, in three or two dimensions. Next as
an illustrative example we present numerical results obtained for the cubic
lattice with nearest neighbor exchange $J$ and Coulomb $V$ elements and
arbitrary electron density. One finds that the range of small doping near half
filling is the most unstable one towards spin polarization, but only in the
case of ferromagnetic intersite exchange $J<0$. Charge Landau parameter $F_0^s$
is lowered near half filling by increasing $U$ when the intersite Coulomb
interaction $V$ is attractive, but in contrast to $F_0^a$ at $J<0$ it requires
an attraction beyond a critical value $V_c$ to generate the divergence of the
charge susceptibility at $F_0^s=-1$ in the metallic phase. This instability was
found for a broad range of electronic filling away from half filling for
moderate attraction.

Consequently, a new two loops algorithm based on ADE-FDTD method is presented

1 to 10 4 mW.mm-2. Furthermore, the three dimensional distribution of

predict the covering fractions of strong HI absorbers ($N_{\rm{HI}} \gtrsim

depend only weakly on halo mass. For massive ($M_{200} \gtrsim 10^{12} {\rm

and we provide fitting functions that reproduce the simulation results. While
efficient feedback is required to increase the HI covering fractions to the
high observed values, the distribution of strong absorbers in and around halos
of a fixed mass is insensitive to factor of two variations in the strength of
the stellar feedback. In contrast, at fixed stellar mass the predicted HI
distribution is highly sensitive to the feedback efficiency. The fiducial EAGLE

motivating an analysis of the initial conditions, evolution, and cosmological

focus on the tensor sector, and study a primordial stochastic gravitational
wave background in massive bigravity. The phenomenology can differ from
standard General Relativity due to non-trivial mixing between the two
linearized tensor fluctuations in the theory, only one of which couples to
matter. We study perturbations about two classes of cosmological solutions in
bigravity, computing the tensor contribution to the temperature anisotropies in
the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and the present stochastic
gravitational wave background. The result is strongly dependent on the choice
of cosmological background and initial conditions. One class of background
solution generically displaying tremendous growth in the amplitude of
large-wavelength gravitational waves, while the other remains observationally
indistinguishable from standard General Relativity for a wide variety of
initial conditions. We analyze the initial conditions for tensor modes expected
in an inflationary cosmology, finding again that there is a strong dependence
on the assumed background. For one choice of background, the semi-classical
theory is beyond the perturbative regime. For the other choice, inflation
generically yields initial conditions that, when evolved, give rise to a
stochastic background observationally indistinguishable from standard General
Relativity.

alongside the stellar system. A 3D-radiative transfer code is then used to
compare the models to observational data. The resulting models display arm

approximately 20 degrees, though with a pattern speed that decreases with
increasing Galactic radius. Inner bars are lacking however, which appear

interferometer's fringe pattern at rates that depend on their position on the
sky. Capitalizing on this geometric interpretation of fringe rates, we employ
time-domain convolution kernels to enact fringe-rate filters that sculpt the
effective primary beam of antennas in an interferometer. As we show, beam
sculpting through fringe-rate filtering can be used to optimize measurements
for a variety of applications, including mapmaking, minimizing polarization
leakage, suppressing instrumental systematics, and enhancing the sensitivity of
power-spectrum measurements. We show that fringe-rate filtering arises
naturally in minimum variance treatments of many of these problems, enabling
optimal visibility-based approaches to analyses of interferometric data that
avoid systematics potentially introduced by traditional approaches such as
imaging. Our techniques have recently been demonstrated in Ali et al. (2015),

boost sensitivity and reduce the impact of systematics in deep observations.

short due to electron-electron scattering. This leads to local equilibration of
electron liquid, and consequently drag is determined by hydrodynamic density
modes. Our theory applies to both the collisionless and the hydrodynamic
regimes, and it enables us to describe the crossover between them. We find that
drag resistivity exhibits a nonmonotonic temperature dependence with multiple
crossovers at distinct energy scales. At the lowest temperatures, Coulomb drag
is dominated by the particle-hole continuum, whereas at higher temperatures of
the collision-dominated regime it is governed by the plasmon modes. We observe

transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a
small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small
moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised
function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by
back-propagation. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the
probabilistic interpretation of denoising auto-encoders and provide an
interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized
pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and
sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). We study
how GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of
variables given the rest. Successful experiments are conducted, validating
these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular
architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows
training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.

first order phase transition exists as a function of the baryochemical
potential $\mu$, since it is established knowledge from ab-initio lattice QCD
simulations that at $\mu=0$ the transition on the temperature axis is a
crossover.
  We present the argument that the observation of a gap in the mass-radius
relationship for compact stars which proves the existence of a so-called third
family (aka ""mass twins"") will imply that the $T=0$ equation of state of
compact star matter exhibits a strong first order transition with a latent heat
that satisfies $\Delta\epsilon/\epsilon_c \gt 0.6$.
  Since such a strong first order transition under compact star conditions will
remain first order when going to symmetric matter, the observation of a
disconnected branch (third family) of compact stars in the mass-radius diagram
proves the existence of a CEP in QCD. For the equation of state of the twins
the quark matter description is based on a QCD-motivated chiral approach with
higher-order quark interactions in the Dirac scalar and vector coupling
channels. For hadronic matter we select a relativistic mean-field equation of
state with density-dependent couplings. Since the nucleons are treated in the
quasi-particle framework, an excluded volume has been included for the nuclear
equation of state at super-saturation density that takes into account the
finite size of the nucleons.
  Furthermore we show results of a Bayesian analysis (BA) using disjunct M-R
constraints for extracting probability measures for cold, dense matter
equations of state. This study reveals that measuring the radii of neutron star
twins has the potential to support the existence of a first order phase
transition for compact star matter.

transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres. Previous analyses employed
the isothermal approximation and dealt only with the transit radius. By
recognising the absorption depth and the transit radius as being independent
observables, we develop a theory for jointly interpreting both quantities,
which allows us to infer the temperatures and number densities associated with
the sodium lines. We are able to treat a non-isothermal situation with a
constant temperature gradient. Our novel diagnostics take the form of
simple-to-use algebraic formulae and require measurements of the transit radii
(and their corresponding absorption depths) at line center and in the line wing
for both sodium lines. We apply our diagnostics to the HARPS data of HD
189733b, confirm the upper atmospheric heating reported by Huitson et al.

ground-state phase of such a system only one condensates is present. This can
be viewed as a spontaneous breakdown of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We study the
phase diagram of the system at finite temperature beyond mean-field
approximation. In the absence of rotation, we show that the system undergoes a
first order phase transition from this ground state to a miscible two-component
normal fluid as temperature is increased. In the presence of rotation, the
system features a competition between vortex-vortex interaction and short range
density-density interactions. This leads to a rotation-driven ""mixing"" phase
transition in a spatially inhomogeneous state with additional broken
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry. Thermal fluctuations in this state lead to nematic
two-component sheets of vortex liquids. At sufficiently strong inter-component
interaction, we find that the superfluid and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase transitions
split. This results in the formation of an intermediate state which breaks only
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. It represents two phase separated normal fluids with
density imbalance.

influences the properties of the supercurrent. Detailed studies of Josephson
junctions can reveal microscopic properties of the superconducting pairing
(spin-triplet correlations, $d$-wave symmetry) or of the electronic transport
(quantum dot, ballistic channels). In recent years, considerable efforts have
focused on the coupling of superconductors to topological insulators, in which
transport is mediated by topologically protected Dirac surface states with
helical spin polarization (while the bulk remains insulating). Here, the
proximity of a superconductor is predicted to give rise to unconventional
induced $p$-wave superconductivity, with a doublet of topologically protected
gapless Andreev bound states, whose energies varies $4\pi$-periodically with
the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In this article, we
report the observation of an anomalous response to rf irradiation in a

Hawking's quantum-mechanical model of BH evaporation makes essentially the same

extended Hawking's model by taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the

depends on the near-horizon state of the Hawking pairs. We find that, after the
Page time when the state of the pairs deviates significantly from maximal
entanglement (as required by unitarity), the induced strain in our
semiclassical model is still parametrically small. This is because the number
of the disentangled pairs is parametrically smaller than the BH entropy. A

effects on physics and geometry on a firmer foundation, and to make it more
understandable. A main point is that two different concepts, number and number
value are combined in the usual representations of number structures. This is
valid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. It
is not valid when different structures of each number type are being
considered. Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by
themselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a
number structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are
described. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number
structures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a
real or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as
scalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. Connections are
described that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M
locations and at neighbor scaling levels. Scalar and vector structure valued
fields are described and covariant derivatives of these fields are obtained.
Two complex vector fields, each with one real and one imaginary field, appear,
with one complex field associated with positions in $M$ and the other with
position dependent scaling factors. A derivation of the covariant derivative
for scalar and vector valued fields gives the same vector fields. The
derivation shows that the complex vector field associated with scaling fiber
levels is the gradient of a complex scalar field. Use of these results in gauge
theory shows that the imaginary part of the vector field associated with M
positions acts like the electromagnetic field. The physical relevance of the
other three fields, if any, is not known.

levitated within an optical cavity, we study its conditional dynamics under
simultaneous sideband cooling and additional time-continuous measurement of
either the output cavity mode or the nanosphere's position. We find that the
average phonon number, purity and quantum squeezing of the steady-states can
all be made more non-classical through the addition of time-continuous
measurement. We predict that the continuous monitoring of the system, together
with Markovian feedback, allows one to stabilize the dynamics for any value of
the laser frequency driving the cavity. By considering state-of-the-art values
of the experimental parameters, we prove that one can in principle obtain a
non-classical (squeezed) steady-state with an average phonon number $n_{\sf

magnetic memory functionality. Traditionally, the macroscopic moment of ordered
spins in FMs is utilized to write information on magnetic media by a weak
external magnetic field, and the FM stray field is used for reading. However,
the latest generation of magnetic random access memories demonstrates a new
efficient approach in which magnetic fields are replaced by electrical means
for reading and writing. This concept may eventually leave the sensitivity of
FMs to magnetic fields as a mere weakness for retention and the FM stray fields
as a mere obstacle for high-density memory integration. In this paper we report
a room-temperature bistable antiferromagnetic (AFM) memory which produces
negligible stray fields and is inert in strong magnetic fields. We use a
resistor made of an FeRh AFM whose transition to a FM order 100 degrees above
room-temperature, allows us to magnetically set different collective directions
of Fe moments. Upon cooling to room-temperature, the AFM order sets in with the
direction the AFM moments pre-determined by the field and moment direction in
the high temperature FM state. For electrical reading, we use an
antiferromagnetic analogue of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). We
report microscopic theory modeling which confirms that this archetypical
spintronic effect discovered more than 150 years ago in FMs, can be equally
present in AFMs. Our work demonstrates the feasibility to realize
room-temperature spintronic memories with AFMs which greatly expands the
magnetic materials base for these devices and offers properties which are
unparalleled in FMs.

its substructure in the projected phase space through the spectrophotometric
properties of a large number of galaxies from the CLASH-VLT survey. Our
analysis is mainly based on an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 445 member
galaxies, mostly acquired with VIMOS@VLT as part of our ESO Large Programme,
sampling the cluster out to a radius ~2R200 (4 Mpc). We classify 412 galaxies
as passive, with strong Hdelta absorption (red and blue galaxies, and with
emission lines from weak to very strong. A number of tests for substructure
detection are applied to analyze the galaxy distribution in the velocity space,
in 2D space, and in 3D projected phase-space. Studied in its entirety, the
cluster appears as a large-scale relaxed system with a few secondary, minor
overdensities in 2D distribution. We detect no velocity gradients or evidence
of deviations in local mean velocities. The main feature is the WNW-ESE
elongation. The analysis of galaxy populations per spectral class highlights a
more complex scenario. The passive galaxies and red strong Hdelta galaxies
trace the cluster center and the WNW-ESE elongated structure. The red strong
Hdelta galaxies also mark a secondary, dense peak ~2 Mpc at ESE. The emission
line galaxies cluster in several loose structures, mostly outside R200. The
observational scenario agrees with MACS J1206.2-0847 having WNW-ESE as the
direction of the main cluster accretion, traced by passive galaxies and red
strong Hdelta galaxies. The red strong Hdelta galaxies, interpreted as
poststarburst galaxies, date a likely important event 1-2 Gyr before the epoch
of observation. The emission line galaxies trace a secondary, ongoing infall
where groups are accreted along several directions.

This is equivalent to the question of ergodicity of a certain family of

automata have been studied in the contexts of enumeration of directed lattice
animals, the golden-mean subshift, and the hard-core model, and their
ergodicity has been noted as an open problem by several authors. We prove that

  On the other hand, we prove that certain analogous games \emph{do} exhibit
draws for suitable parameter values on various directed graphs in higher

$\mathbb{Z}^d$ in all $d\geq3$. This is proved via a dimension reduction to a
hard-core lattice gas in dimension $d-1$. We show that draws occur whenever the
corresponding hard-core model has multiple Gibbs distributions. We conjecture

of white dwarfs. However, these surveys are subject to complicated target
selection algorithms, which make it almost impossible to quantify to what
extent the observational biases affect the observed populations. The LAMOST
(Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) Spectroscopic
Survey of the Galactic anti-center (LSS-GAC) follows a well-defined set of
criteria for selecting targets for observations. This advantage over previous
surveys has been fully exploited here to identify a small yet
well-characterised magnitude-limited sample of hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarfs.
We derive preliminary LSS-GAC DA white dwarf luminosity and mass functions. The
space density and average formation rate of DA white dwarfs we derive are
0.83+/-0.16 x 10^{-3} pc^{-3} and 5.42 +/- 0.08 x 10^{-13} pc^{-3} yr^{-1},
respectively. Additionally, using an existing Monte Carlo population synthesis
code we simulate the population of single DA white dwarfs in the Galactic
anti-center, under various assumptions. The synthetic populations are passed
through the LSS-GAC selection criteria, taking into account all possible
observational biases. This allows us to perform a meaningful comparison of the
observed and simulated distributions. We find that the LSS-GAC set of criteria
is highly efficient in selecting white dwarfs for spectroscopic observations
(80-85 per cent) and that, overall, our simulations reproduce well the observed
luminosity function. However, they fail at reproducing an excess of massive
white dwarfs present in the observed mass function. A plausible explanation for
this is that a sizable fraction of massive white dwarfs in the Galaxy are the
product of white dwarf-white dwarf mergers.

propagation measurements obtained with a 400 megachips per second broadband
sliding correlator channel sounder and highly directional, steerable horn
antennas in New York City. A 3GPP-like statistical channel model that is easy
to implement in software or hardware is developed from measured power delay
profiles and a synthesized method for providing absolute propagation delays
recovered from 3-D ray-tracing, as well as measured angle of departure and
angle of arrival power spectra. The extracted statistics are used to implement
a MATLAB-based statistical simulator that generates 3-D millimeter-wave
temporal and spatial channel coefficients that reproduce realistic impulse
responses of measured urban channels. The methods and model presented here can
be used for millimeter-wave system-wide simulations, and air interface design
and capacity analyses.

  Sampling",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is an important and commonly used
tool for the analysis of hierarchical models. Nevertheless, practitioners
generally have two options for MCMC: utilize existing software that generates a
black-box ""one size fits all"" algorithm, or the challenging (and time
consuming) task of implementing a problem-specific MCMC algorithm. Either
choice may result in inefficient sampling, and hence researchers have become
accustomed to MCMC runtimes on the order of days (or longer) for large models.
We propose an automated procedure to determine an efficient MCMC algorithm for
a given model and computing platform. Our procedure dynamically determines
blocks of parameters for joint sampling that result in efficient sampling of
the entire model. We test this procedure using a diverse suite of example
models, and observe non-trivial improvements in MCMC efficiency for many
models. Our procedure is the first attempt at such, and may be generalized to a
broader space of MCMC algorithms. Our results suggest that substantive
improvements in MCMC efficiency may be practically realized using our automated
blocking procedure, or variants thereof, which warrants additional study and
application.

stellar winds in those systems using the Block Adaptive Tree Solar-wind Roe
Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) code. The BATS-R-US code was originally written to

the host star. They will also allow us to determine what influence the winds
will have on the space weather environment of the planet. This paper presents
the preliminary results of these simulations for the star $\tau$ Bo\""otis,
using a newly reconstructed magnetic field map based on previously published
observations. These simulations show interesting structures in the wind

both consistent with rotational instability and partial disruption of the

bodies, which, however, do not eject detectable fragments at the present-day
epoch, and also fragmentation events have been observed, but with no rotation
period measured. P/2012 F5 is unique in that for the first time we detected
fragments and quantified the rotation rate of one and the same object. The
rapid spin rate of P/2012 F5 is very close to the spin rates of two other
active asteroids in the Main Belt, 133P/Elst-Pizarro and (62412), confirming
the existence of a population of fast rotators among these objects. But while
P/2012 F5 shows impulsive ejection of dust and fragments, the mass loss from
133P is prolonged and recurrent. We believe that these two types of activity
observed in the rapidly rotating active asteroids have a common origin in the
rotational instability of the nucleus.

allowing relays to compute combinations of source messages. The computed
message combinations at relays are correlated, and so directly forwarding these
combinations to a destination generally incurs information redundancy and
spectrum inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel relay
strategy, termed compute-compress-and-forward (CCF). In CCF, source messages
are encoded using nested lattice codes constructed on a chain of nested coding
and shaping lattices. A key difference of CCF from CF is an extra compressing
stage inserted in between the computing and forwarding stages of a relay, so as
to reduce the forwarding information rate of the relay. The compressing stage
at each relay consists of two operations: first to quantize the computed
message combination on an appropriately chosen lattice (referred to as a
quantization lattice), and then to take modulo on another lattice (referred to
as a modulo lattice). We study the design of the quantization and modulo
lattices and propose successive recovering algorithms to ensure the
recoverability of source messages at destination. Based on that, we formulate a
sum-rate maximization problem that is in general an NP-hard mixed integer
program. A low-complexity algorithm is proposed to give a suboptimal solution.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of CCF over the
existing CF schemes.

both industry and research communities since the development of communication
technology and smart city. However, a proprietary and closed way of operating
hardwares in network equipments slows down the progress of new services
deployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control and data
planes in traditional networks significantly increase the complexity and cost
of network management. By proposing a novel architecture, called
Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDIV), we adopt the software-defined
network (SDN) architecture to address these problems by leveraging its
separation of the control plane from the data plane and a uniform way to
configure heterogeneous switches. However, the characteristics of IoV introduce
the very challenges in rule installation due to the limited size of Flow Tables
at OpenFlow-enabled switches which are the main component of SDN. It is
necessary to build compact Flow Tables for the scalability of IoV. Accordingly,
we develop a rule optimization approach for real-time query service in SDIV.
Specifically, we separate wired data plane from wireless data plane and use
multicast address in wireless data plane. Furthermore, we introduce a
destination-driven model in wired data plane for reducing the number of rules
at switches. Experiments show that our rule optimization strategy reduces the
number of rules while keeping the performance of data transmission.

quantify the statistical distance between them. We find that there is indeed a
close quantitative correspondence between $P_n$ and $\tilde{P}_n$ for a wide
range of states, justifying the broadly accepted view that, for highly occupied
modes, individual stochastic realisations of Wigner trajectories should
approximately correspond to outcomes of single experiments. However, we also
find counterexamples for which high mode occupation may not be sufficient for
such an interpretation, we find instead that a more relevant and sufficient
requirement is the smoothness and broadness of the Wigner function $W(\alpha)$

can then measure the temperature of a probe that is weakly coupled to a

value of some observable of the system is minimally perturbed, one obtains a
parameter that measures its degree of local statistical excitation, and hence
its local heating. However, one anticipates that different observables may lead
to different temperatures and thus different local heating expectations. We
propose an experimentally realizable protocol to measure such local
temperatures and apply it to bias-driven quantum dots. By means of a highly
accurate open quantum system approach, we show theoretically that the measured
temperature is quite insensitive both to the choice of observable and to the
probe-system coupling. In particular, even with observables that are distinct
both physically and in their degree of locality, such as the local magnetic
susceptibility of the quantum dot and the global spin-polarized current
measured at the leads, the resulting local temperatures are quantitatively
similar for quantum dots ranging from noninteracting to Kondo-correlated
regimes, and are close to those obtained with the traditional ""local

semi-structured data sets by their concepts improves the effectiveness of
answering queries over these data sets. As every enterprise has a limited
budget of time or computational resources, it has to annotate a subset of
concepts in a given domain whose costs of annotation do not exceed the budget.
We call such a subset of concepts a {\it conceptual design} for the annotated
data set. We focus on finding a conceptual design that provides the most
effective answers to queries over the annotated data set, i.e., a {\it
cost-effective conceptual design}. Since, it is often less time-consuming and
costly to annotate general concepts than specific concepts, we use information
on superclass/subclass relationships between concepts in taxonomies to find a
cost-effective conceptual design. We quantify the amount by which a conceptual
design with concepts from a taxonomy improves the effectiveness of answering
queries over an annotated data set. If the taxonomy is a tree, we prove that
the problem is NP-hard and propose an efficient approximation and
pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the problem. We further prove that if the
taxonomy is a directed acyclic graph, given some generally accepted hypothesis,
it is not possible to find any approximation algorithm with reasonably small
approximation ratio for the problem. Our empirical study using real-world data
sets, taxonomies, and query workloads shows that our framework effectively
quantifies the amount by which a conceptual design improves the effectiveness
of answering queries. It also indicates that our algorithms are efficient for a
design-time task with pseudo-polynomial algorithm being generally more
effective than the approximation algorithm.

shows that the averaged luminosity of flat-spectral radio quasars (FSRQs) is
larger than that of BL Lacs objects. On the other hand, the broad band spectral
energy distribution reveals that FSRQs and low energy peaked BL Lac objects
(LBLs) objects have similar spectral properties, but high energy peaked BL Lac
objects (HBLs) have a distinct spectral property. This may be due to that
different subclasses of blazars have different intrinsic environments and are
at different cooling levels. Even so, a unified scheme also is revealed from
the color-color diagram, which hints that there are similar physical processes
operating in all objects under a range of intrinsic physical conditions or

($\mathtt{LEM}$) for multihop energy harvesting networks. Different from prior
works on this problem, our algorithm explicitly incorporates information
learning into system control via a step called \emph{perturbed dual learning}.
$\mathtt{LEM}$ does not require any statistical information of the system
dynamics for implementation, and efficiently resolves the challenging energy
outage problem. We show that $\mathtt{LEM}$ achieves the near-optimal
$[O(\epsilon), O(\log(1/\epsilon)^2)]$ utility-delay tradeoff with an
$O(1/\epsilon^{1-c/2})$ energy buffers ($c\in(0,1)$). More interestingly,
$\mathtt{LEM}$ possesses a \emph{convergence time} of $O(1/\epsilon^{1-c/2}
+1/\epsilon^c)$, which is much faster than the $\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ time of
pure queue-based techniques or the $\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ time of approaches
that rely purely on learning the system statistics. This fast convergence
property makes $\mathtt{LEM}$ more adaptive and efficient in resource
allocation in dynamic environments. The design and analysis of $\mathtt{LEM}$
demonstrate how system control algorithms can be augmented by learning and what
the benefits are. The methodology and algorithm can also be applied to similar
problems, e.g., processing networks, where nodes require nonzero amount of

neural networks which we call Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC).
K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's
Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some
cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large
blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker
product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive
to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC
make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm
that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in
practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate
natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature
matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly
stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and
inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the
amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated
only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.

the point spread function (PSF) is only poorly known or completely unknown.
Moreover, an accurate modeling of the PSF is in general not available.
Therefore in several imaging situations the so-called blind deconvolution
methods, aiming at estimating both the scientific target and the PSF from the
detected image, can be useful. A blind deconvolution problem is severely
ill-posed and, in order to reduce the extremely large number of possible
solutions, it is necessary to introduce sensible constraints on both the
scientific target and the PSF. In a previous paper we proposed a sound
mathematical approach based on a suitable inexact alternating minimization
strategy for minimizing the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence, assuring
global convergence. In the framework of this method we showed that an important
constraint on the PSF is the upper bound which can be derived from the
knowledge of its Strehl ratio. The efficacy of the approach was demonstrated by
means of numerical simulations. In this paper, besides improving the previous
approach by the use of a further constraint on the unknown scientific target,
we extend it to the case of multiple images of the same target obtained with
different PSFs. The main application we have in mind is to Fizeau
interferometry. As it is known this is a special feature of the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT). The method is applied to realistic simulations of imaging both
by single mirrors and Fizeau interferometers. Successes and failures of the
method in the imaging of stellar fields are demonstrated in simple cases. These
preliminary results look promising at least in specific situations. The IDL
code of the proposed method is available on request and will be included in the
forthcoming version of the Software Package AIRY (v.6.1).

user-specified values. We applied the recalibration strategy to two D-Wave Two
quantum annealers, one at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field,

of massive daughters with non-relativistic recoil velocity $V_k$. This decaying
dark matter model (DDM) can suppress the structure formation below its
free-streaming scale at time scale comparable to $\tau$. Comparing with warm
dark matter (WDM), DDM can better reduce the small structures while being
consistent with high redshfit observations. We study the cosmological structure
formation in DDM by performing self-consistent N-body simulations and point out
that cosmological simulations are necessary to understand the DDM structures

DDM suppression of the mass function and the mass-concentration relation, which
depend on the decay parameters lifetime $\tau$ and recoil velocity $V_k$, and
redshift. The fitting functions lead to accurate reconstruction of the the
non-linear power transfer function of DDM to CDM in the framework of halo
model. Using these results, we set constraints on the DDM parameter space by
demanding that DDM does not induce larger suppression than the Lyman-$\alpha$
constrained WDM models. We further generalize and constrain the DDM models to
initial conditions with non-trivial mother fractions and show that the halo
model predictions are still valid after considering a global decayed fraction.
Finally, we point out that the DDM is unlikely to resolve the disagreement on

imaging. This task arises for example in dynamic renal scintigraphy, where
impulse response or retention functions are estimated, or in functional
magnetic resonance imaging where hemodynamic response functions are required.
These functions can not be observed directly and their estimation is
complicated because the recorded images are subject to superposition of
underlying signals. Therefore, the response functions are estimated via blind
source separation and deconvolution. Performance of this algorithm heavily
depends on the used models of the response functions. Response functions in
real image sequences are rather complicated and finding a suitable parametric
form is problematic. In this paper, we study estimation of the response
functions using non-parametric Bayesian priors. These priors were designed to
favor desirable properties of the functions, such as sparsity or smoothness.
These assumptions are used within hierarchical priors of the blind source
separation and deconvolution algorithm. Comparison of the resulting algorithms
with these priors is performed on synthetic dataset as well as on real datasets
from dynamic renal scintigraphy. It is shown that flexible non-parametric
priors improve estimation of response functions in both cases. MATLAB
implementation of the resulting algorithms is freely available for download.

  Efficient multiprocessor computing requires implementations of basic data
structures that can be used concurrently and scale to large numbers of threads
and cores. Lock-free data structures promise superior scalability by avoiding
blocking synchronization primitives, but the \emph{delete-min} operation is an
inherent scalability bottleneck in concurrent priority queues. Recent work has
focused on alleviating this obstacle either by batching operations, or by
relaxing the requirements to the \emph{delete-min} operation.
  We present a new, lock-free priority queue that relaxes the \emph{delete-min}
operation so that it is allowed to delete \emph{any} of the $\rho+1$ smallest
keys, where $\rho$ is a runtime configurable parameter. Additionally, the
behavior is identical to a non-relaxed priority queue for items added and
removed by the same thread. The priority queue is built from a logarithmic
number of sorted arrays in a way similar to log-structured merge-trees. We

possibility of a pattern of oscillations in which one torus produces traveling
waves of constant phase shift, while the second torus shows synchronous
in-phase oscillations, at $N-$ times the frequency shown by the traveling

planetary magnetospheric sizes of 4.1 to 5.6 planetary radii. We also derive

to become a serious handicap in cases of physical interest (2,3,4,5). Our
general search algorithm works with almost arbitrary diffusion operator with
only restriction of having the initial state as one of its eigenstates. The
price that we pay for using arbitrary operator is an increase in the number of
oracle queries by a factor of order of B, where B is a characteristic of the
eigenspectrum of diffusion operator and it can be large in some situations.
Here we show that by using quantum fourier transform, we can regain the optimal
query complexity of Grover algorithm without losing the freedom of using
arbitrary diffusion operators for quantum searching. However, the total number
of operators required by algorithm is still order of B times more than that of
Grover algorithm. So our algorithm offers advantage only if oracle operator is
computationally more expensive than diffusion operator, which is true in most

mechanics and central to our understanding of equilibrium states of matter.
Recently, it has been shown that there is a formal connection between the
dynamics of open quantum systems and the statistical mechanics in an extra
dimension. This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics
generates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible
quantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions
in the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of
continuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad
master equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which
encodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed
total observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates
trajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events
into the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an
interesting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different
ensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by
total number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of
different thermodynamic ensembles, akin to ""grand-canonical"" and ""isobaric"",
but for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are
equivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is
in direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence
between ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An
intrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all
observables that commute with the number of quantum jumps.

the $j$th oscillator ($1\leq j\leq N$) has the natural frequency $\omega_j$ and

The oscillators are coupled adjacently with coupling constants that are purely
imaginary; the coupling of the $j$th oscillator to the $(j+1)$st oscillator has
the bilinear form $i\gamma x_jx_{j+1}$ ($\gamma$ real). The complex
Hamiltonians for these systems exhibit {\it partial} $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry;
that is, they are invariant under $i\to-i$ (time reversal), $x_j\to-x_j$ ($j$
odd), and $x_j\to x_j$ ($j$ even). [They are also invariant under $i\to-i$,
$x_j\to x_j$ ($j$ odd), and $x_j\to- x_j$ ($j$ even).] For all $N$ the quantum
energy levels of these systems are calculated exactly and it is shown that the
ground-state energy is real. When $\omega_j=1$ for all $j$, the full spectrum
consists of a real energy spectrum embedded in a complex one; the
eigenfunctions corresponding to real energy levels exhibit partial
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. However, if the $\omega_j$ are allowed to vary away
from unity, one can induce a phase transition at which {\it all} energies
become real. For the special case $N=2$, when the spectrum is real, the
associated classical system has localized, almost-periodic orbits in phase
space and the classical particle is confined in the complex-coordinate plane.
However, when the spectrum of the quantum system is partially real, the
corresponding classical system displays only open trajectories for which the
classical particle spirals off to infinity. Similar behavior is observed when
$N>2$.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and spin dipole-dipole interactions are induced. As a
result, $p$-wave superconductivity is induced with the gap function $d$-vector
being not aligned with the internal magnetic field of the spin-orbit
interaction. Most importantly, the ground state goes through transitions into
gapless phases with split nodal points. The split nodal structure always
results in Majorana modes for any interfaces that are not exactly in (100) or
(010) directions. Hence for general interfaces, existence of Majorana bound
edge states is a robust feature. Our results indicate that these Majorana modes
would result in a small plateau in tunneling spectrum near zero bias peak and
in 4 $\pi$ periodicity in typical SIS$'$ junctions . As a result, it is easy

may excite coherent oscillations in the disk perpendicular to its plane. We
determine the properties of these modes for various self-gravitating plane
symmetric systems (Spitzer sheets) using the matrix method of Kalnajs. In
particular, we find an infinite series of modes for the case of a barotropic
fluid. In general, for a collisionless system, there is a double series of
modes, which include normal modes and/or Landau-damped oscillations depending
on the phase space distribution function of the stars. Even Landau-damped
oscillations may decay slowly enough to persist for several hundred Myr. We
discuss the implications of these results for the recently discovered vertical
perturbations in the kinematics of solar neighborhood stars and for broader
questions surrounding secular phenomena such as spiral structure in disk
galaxies.

advances. Much of its focus so far has been on the modelling of the magnitudes
of extreme events but little attention has been paid on the timing of extremes.
To address this gap, this paper introduces the notion of extremal concurrence.
Suppose that one measures precipitation at several synoptic stations over
multiple days. We say that extremes are concurrent if the maximum precipitation
over time at each station is achieved simultaneously, e.g., on a single day.
Under general conditions, we show that the finite sample concurrence
probability converges to an asymptotic quantity, deemed extremal concurrence
probability. Using Palm calculus, we establish general expressions for the
extremal concurrence probability through the max-stable process emerging in the
limit of the componentwise maxima of the sample. Explicit forms of the extremal
concurrence probabilities are obtained for various max-stable models and
several estimators are introduced. In particular, we prove that the pairwise
extremal concurrence probability for max-stable vectors is precisely equal to
the Kendall's $\tau$. The estimators are evaluated by using simulations and
applied to study the concurrence patterns of temperature extremes in the United
States. The results demonstrate that concurrence probability can provide a
powerful new perspective and tools for the analysis of the spatial structure
and impact of extremes.

simply by considering the effect of the Zeeman gap in magnon excitation. This
result requires us to introduce magnon-frequency-dependent mechanism into the

magnetic field dependence of the LSSE voltage was observed to change by
changing the thickness of YIG, suggesting that the thermo-spin conversion by
the low-frequency magnons is suppressed in thin YIG films due to the long
characteristic lengths of such magnons.

grain in two regions of interest: exine and inner part. A coarse-to-fine
approach ensures a smooth and accurate segmentation of both structures. As a
rough stage, grain segmentation is performed by a procedure involving
clustering and morphological operations, while the exine is approximated by an
iterative procedure consisting in consecutive cropping steps of the pollen
grain. A snake-based segmentation is performed to refine the segmentation of
both structures. Results have shown that our segmentation method is able to
deal with different pollen types, as well as with different types of exine and

microscope pollen images. The framework is meant to be generic and based on a
brute force-like approach aimed to be efficient not only on any kind, and any
number, of pollen images (regardless of the pollen type), but also on any kind
of multi-focal images. All stages of the framework's pipeline are designed to
be used in an automatic fashion. First, the optimal focus is selected using the
absolute gradient method. Then, pollen grains are extracted using a
coarse-to-fine approach involving both clustering and morphological techniques
(coarse stage), and a snake-based segmentation (fine stage). Finally, features
are extracted and selected using a generalized approach, and their
classification is tested with four classifiers: Weighted Neighbor Distance,
Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. The latter method, which has
shown the best and more robust classification accuracy results (above 97\% for
any number of pollen types), is finally used for the authentication stage.

tree coalescences can take place, and their enumerative properties assist in
understanding the computational complexity of calculations central in the study
of gene trees and species trees. Here, we solve an enumerative problem left
open by Rosenberg (IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and
Bioinformatics 10: 1253-1262, 2013) concerning the number of coalescent
histories for gene trees and species trees with a matching labeled topology
that belongs to a generic caterpillar-like family. By bringing a generating
function approach to the study of coalescent histories, we prove that for any
caterpillar-like family with seed tree $t$, the sequence $(h_n)_{n\geq 0}$
describing the number of matching coalescent histories of the $n$th tree of the
family grows asymptotically as a constant multiple of the Catalan numbers.
Thus, $h_n \sim \beta_t c_n$, where the asymptotic constant $\beta_t > 0$
depends on the shape of the seed tree $t$. The result extends a claim
demonstrated only for seed trees with at most 8 taxa to arbitrary seed trees,
expanding the set of cases for which detailed enumerative properties of
coalescent histories can be determined. We introduce a procedure that computes
from $t$ the constant $\beta_t$ as well as the algebraic expression for the

$\pi-0$ transitions which can be controlled by varying the temperature and the

varies with doping and the bias. Such scattering phases are responsible for the
$\pi-0$ transitions. On the other hand if both of the electrodes are coupled to
the same layer of the flake or the flake has AA stacking instead of common AB,
the junction will be always in $0$ state since layer or sublattice index is not

large-scale structure growth observables using the exact and covariant
framework of Macroscopic Gravity (MG). It is well-known that applying the
Einstein's equations and spatial averaging do not commute and lead to the
averaging problem. For the MG formalism applied to the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, this gives an extra
dynamical term encapsulated as an averaging density parameter denoted
$\Omega_A$. An exact isotropic cosmological solution of MG for the flat FLRW
metric is already known in the literature, we derive here an anisotropic exact
solution. Using the isotropic solution, we compare the expansion history to
current data of distances to supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, CMB last
scattering surface, and Hubble constant measurements, and find $-0.05 \le
\Omega_A \le 0.07$ (at the 95% CL). For the flat metric case this reduces to
$-0.03 \le \Omega_A \le 0.05$. We also find that the inclusion of this term in
the fits can shift the values of the usual cosmological parameters by a few to
several percents. Next, we derive an equation for the growth rate of large
scale structure in MG that includes a term due to the averaging and compare it
to that of the LCDM concordance model. We find that an $\Omega_A$ of an
amplitude range within the bounds above leads to a relative deviation of the
growth from that of the LCDM of up to 2-4% at late times. Thus, the shift in
the growth could be of comparable amplitude to that caused by similar changes
in cosmological parameters like the dark energy density parameter or its
equation of state. The effect could also be comparable in amplitude to some
systematic effects considered for future surveys. This indicates that the
averaging term and its possible effect need to be tightly constrained in future
precision cosmological studies. (Abridged)

heterogeneity. This is unfortunate since the occurrence of an event may alter

extra-galactic regions, while the attempt to associate their origin with the
inflationary epoch alone has been found extremely challenging. We therefore
take into account the consistent post-inflationary evolution of the magnetic
fields that are originated from vacuum fluctuations during inflation. In the
model of our interest, the electromagnetic (EM) field is coupled to a
pseudo-scalar inflaton $\phi$ through the characteristic term $\phi F\tilde F$,
breaking the conformal invariance. This interaction dynamically breaks the
parity and enables a continuous production of only one of the polarization
states of the EM field through tachyonic instability. The produced magnetic
fields are thus helical. We find that the dominant contribution to the observed
magnetic fields in this model comes from the modes that leave the horizon near
the end of inflation, further enhanced by the tachyonic instability right after
the end of inflation. The EM field is subsequently amplified by parametric
resonance during the period of inflaton oscillation. Once the thermal plasma is
formed (reheating), the produced helical magnetic fields undergo a turbulent
process called inverse cascade, which shifts their peak correlation scales from
smaller to larger scales. We consistently take all these effects into account
within the regime where the perturbation of $\phi$ is negligible and obtain
$B_{\rm eff} \sim 10^{-19}$G, indicating the necessity of additional mechanisms
to accommodate the observations.

that all perform compatible services but that exhibit behavioral differences

Objective: We aim at proposing an approach for automatically assessing the
presence of computational diversity. In this work, computationally diverse
variants are defined as (i) sharing the same API, (ii) behaving the same
according to an input-output based specification (a test-suite) and (iii)
exhibiting observable differences when they run outside the specified input
space. Method: Our technique relies on test amplification. We propose source
code transformations on test cases to explore the input domain and
systematically sense the observation domain. We quantify computational
diversity as the dissimilarity between observations on inputs that are outside
the specified domain. Results: We run our experiments on 472 variants of 7
classes from open-source, large and thoroughly tested Java classes. Our test
amplification multiplies by ten the number of input points in the test suite
and is effective at detecting software diversity. Conclusion: The key insights
of this study are: the systematic exploration of the observable output space of
a class provides new insights about its degree of encapsulation; the behavioral

$\sim$30 counts s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5--50 keV band with $\sim$10% peak-to-peak
flux variation. The time-averaged X-ray spectrum cannot be described by a
multi-color disk and single Compton component with its reflection, but requires
additional Comptonized emissions. This double Compton component model allows a
slightly larger inner radius of the multi-color disk, implying a lower spin
parameter. Significant spectral evolution was observed above 8 keV along with a
flux decrease on a timescale of $\sim$10$^4$--10$^5$ s. By spectral fitting, we
show that this behavior is well explained by changes in the hard Comptonized
emission component in contrast to the maintained disk and soft Comptonized

bounded maximum degree and maximum size of hyperedges. With an activity
parameter $\lambda$, each matching $M$ is assigned a weight $\lambda^{|M|}$.
The counting problem is formulated as computing a partition function that gives
the sum of the weights of all matchings in a hypergraph. This problem unifies
two extensively studied statistical physics models in approximate counting: the
hardcore model (graph independent sets) and the monomer-dimer model (graph
matchings).
  For this model, the critical activity $\lambda_c= \frac{d^d}{k (d-1)^{d+1}}$
is the threshold for the uniqueness of Gibbs measures on the infinite
$(d+1)$-uniform $(k+1)$-regular hypertree. Consider hypergraphs of maximum
degree at most $k+1$ and maximum size of hyperedges at most $d+1$. We show that
when $\lambda < \lambda_c$, there is an FPTAS for computing the partition
function; and when $\lambda = \lambda_c$, there is a PTAS for computing the
log-partition function. These algorithms are based on the decay of correlation
(strong spatial mixing) property of Gibbs distributions. When $\lambda >
2\lambda_c$, there is no PRAS for the partition function or the log-partition
function unless NP$=$RP.
  Towards obtaining a sharp transition of computational complexity of
approximate counting, we study the local convergence from a sequence of finite
hypergraphs to the infinite lattice with specified symmetry. We show a
surprising connection between the local convergence and the reversibility of a
natural random walk. This leads us to a barrier for the hardness result: The
non-uniqueness of infinite Gibbs measure is not realizable by any finite
gadgets.

to a negative BAU by the EWPT time. In contrast, a sufficiently small initial

growth and the corresponding BAU growth from zero to some positive
