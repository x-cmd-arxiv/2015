which allows variation of the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light
$c$. Three different approaches to the formulation of the field equations are
presented. Some cosmological solutions for each framework are given and one of
them is tested against combined observational data (supernovae, BAO, and CMB).
From the fit of the data it is found that the Hawking temperature numerical
coefficient $\gamma$ is two to four orders of magnitude less than usually
assumed on the geometrical ground theoretical value of $O(1)$ and that it is
also compatible with zero. Besides, in the entropic scenario we observationally
test that the fit of the data is allowed for the speed of light $c$ growing and
the gravitational constant $G$ diminishing during the evolution of the
universe. We also obtain a bound on the variation of $c$ to be $\Delta c/c
\propto 10^{-5} >0$ which is at least one order of magnitude weaker than the
quasar spectra observational bound.

are becoming increasingly important for video service providers, such as
Youtube and Netflix, while multi-view 3D videos have the potential to inspire a
variety of innovative applications. However, enabling multi-view 3D video
services may overwhelm WiFi networks when every view of a video are
multicasted. In this paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate
depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), which allows each mobile client to
synthesize the desired view from nearby left and right views, in order to
effectively reduce the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, when each client
suffers from packet losses, retransmissions incur additional bandwidth
consumption and excess delay, which in turn undermines the quality of
experience in video applications. To address the above issue, we first discover
the merit of view protection via DIBR for multi-view video multicast using a
mathematical analysis and then design a new protocol, named Multi-View Group
Management Protocol (MVGMP), to support the dynamic join and leave of users and
the change of desired views. The simulation results demonstrate that our
protocol effectively reduces bandwidth consumption and increases the
probability for each client to successfully playback the desired views in a
multi-view 3D video.

methods. ABC methods use a comparison between simulated data, using different
parameters drew from a prior distribution, and observed data. This comparison
process is based on computing a distance between the summary statistics from
the simulated data and the observed data. For complex models, it is usually
difficult to define a methodology for choosing or constructing the summary
statistics. Recently, a nonparametric ABC has been proposed, that uses a
dissimilarity measure between discrete distributions based on empirical kernel
embeddings as an alternative for summary statistics. The nonparametric ABC
outperforms other methods including ABC, kernel ABC or synthetic likelihood
ABC. However, it assumes that the probability distributions are discrete, and
it is not robust when dealing with few observations. In this paper, we propose
to apply kernel embeddings using an smoother density estimator or Parzen
estimator for comparing the empirical data distributions, and computing the ABC
posterior. Synthetic data and real data were used to test the Bayesian
inference of our method. We compare our method with respect to state-of-the-art

distribution in terms of the number of observations.

The points of emphasis are: (i) The magnetic ordering temperature of Cr appears
to be suppressed compared to that in isostructural Nd counterpart, NdCrTiO5,
for which the Neel temperature is about 21 K. This finding on the Gd compound
suggests that Nd 4f orbital plays a role on the magnetism of Cr in contrast to

feature below about 30 K in the absence of external magnetic field, but a peak
appears and gets stronger with the application of external magnetic fields,
supporting the existence of magnetodielectric coupling. (iii) The dielectric
anomalies appear even near 100 K, which can be attributed to short-range
magnetic-order. We also observe a gain in spectral weight below about 150 K in
Raman spectra in the frequency range 150 to 400 cm-1, which could be magnetic
in origin supporting short-range magnetic order. It is of interest to explore

event in decision theory corresponds to the measurement of an observable. This
analogy looks clear for operationally testable simple events. However, the
situation is essentially more complicated in the case of composite events. The
most difficult point is the relation between decisions under uncertainty and
measurements under uncertainty. We suggest a unified language for describing
the processes of quantum decision making and quantum measurements. The notion
of quantum measurements under uncertainty is introduced. We show that the
correct mathematical foundation for the theory of measurements under
uncertainty, as well as for quantum decision theory dealing with uncertain
events, requires the use of positive operator-valued measure that is a
generalization of projection-valued measure. The latter is appropriate for
operationally testable events, while the former is necessary for characterizing
operationally uncertain events. In both decision making and quantum
measurements, one has to distinguish composite non-entangled events from
composite entangled events. Quantum probability can be essentially different
from classical probability only for entangled events. The necessary condition
for the appearance of an interference term in the quantum probability is the
occurrence of entangled prospects and the existence of an entangled strategic
state of a decision maker or of an entangled statistical state of a measuring
device.

It is applied to the computation of regularized forms of certain integrals of

remarkably different behaviours when many-particle correlations are taken into
account, leading to the emergence of the Kondo effect. Our numerical
renormalization group results indicate that while spin noise is a universal
function of the Kondo temperature, charge noise remains well described by
single-particle theory even when the trap is deep in the Kondo regime. This
difference survives even in the presence of disorder, showing that noise can be
more manageable in devices that are sensitive to magnetic (rather than charge)
fluctuations and that the signature of the Kondo effect can be observed in spin
noise spectroscopy experiments.

influence on the reaction cross section at energies relevant for astrophysics.
Several experiments have been performed to determine the contribution of this

significant discrepancies between different measurements remain.
  Purpose: The aim of this work is to investigate these discrepancies.
  Method: An 8 MeV $^{13}$C beam (below the Coulomb barrier) was used to study
the $\alpha$-transfer reaction $^6$Li($^{13}$C,$d$)$^{17}$O.
  Results: The squared Coulomb modified ANC of the 1/2$^+$ state in $^{17}$O
measured in this work is $(\tilde

can be transferred toward an accreting compact object at extremely high rate.
If the transferred mass is efficiently converted to X-ray luminosity (with
disregard of the classical Eddington limit) or if the X-rays are focused into a
narrow beam then binaries can form extreme ULX sources with the X-ray
luminosity of Lx>10^42 erg/s. For example, Lasota & King argued that the
brightest known ULX (HLX-1) is a regular binary system with a rather low-mass
compact object (a stellar-origin black hole or a neutron star). The predicted
formation efficiencies and lifetimes of binaries with the very high mass
transfer rates are large enough to explain all observed systems with extreme
X-ray luminosities. These systems are not only limited to binaries with
stellar-origin black hole accretors. Noteworthy, we have also identified such
objects with neutron stars. Typically, a 10 Msun black hole is fed by a massive
(10 Msun) Hertzsprung gap donor with Roche lobe overflow rate of 10^-3 Msun/yr
(2600 MEdd). For neutron star systems the typical donors are evolved low-mass
(2 Msun) helium stars with Roche lobe overflow rate of 10^-2 Msun/yr. Our study
does not prove that any particular extreme ULX is a regular binary system, but
it demonstrates that any ULX, including the most luminous ones, may potentially
be a short-lived phase in the life of a binary star.

also allows the effects of structure formation on the large-scale expansion of

we use this formalism to investigate the cosmological behaviour of a large

photosphere is curl-free (hence, by Ampere's law, also current-free), so can be
represented as the gradient of a scalar potential. Since magnetic fields are
divergence free, this scalar potential obeys Laplace's equation, given an
appropriate boundary condition (BC). With measurements of the full magnetic
vector at the photosphere, it is possible to employ either Neumann or Dirichlet
BCs there. Historically, the Neumann BC was used with available line-of-sight
magnetic field measurements, which approximate the radial field needed for the
Neumann BC. Since each BC fully determines the 3D vector magnetic field, either
choice will, in general, be inconsistent with some aspect of the observed field
on the boundary, due to the presence of both currents and noise in the observed
field. We present a method to combine solutions from both Dirichlet and Neumann
BCs to determine a hybrid, ""least-squares"" potential field, which minimizes the
integrated square of the residual between the potential and actual fields. This
has advantages in both not overfitting the radial field used for the Neumann
BC, and maximizing consistency with the observations. We demonstrate our
methods with SDO/HMI vector magnetic field observations of AR 11158, and find
that residual discrepancies between the observed and potential fields are
significant, and are consistent with nonzero horizontal photospheric currents.
We also analyze potential fields for two other active regions observed with two
different vector magnetographs, and find that hybrid potential fields have
significantly less energy than the Neumann fields in every case --- by more
than 10^(32) erg in some cases. This has major implications for estimates of
free magnetic energy in coronal field models, e.g., non-linear force-free field
extrapolations.

renewed interest in adiabatic quantum computation, and in particular quantum

features of the evolution can survive over the long time-scales used for
quantum annealing relative to standard measures of the decoherence time. We
reconsider the role of decoherence in adiabatic quantum computation and quantum
annealing using the adiabatic quantum master equation formalism. We restrict
ourselves to the weak-coupling and singular-coupling limits, which correspond
to decoherence in the energy eigenbasis and in the computational basis,
respectively. We demonstrate that decoherence in the instantaneous energy
eigenbasis does not necessarily detrimentally affect adiabatic quantum
computation, and in particular that a short single-qubit $T_2$ time need not
imply adverse consequences for the success of the quantum adiabatic algorithm.
We further demonstrate that boundary cancellation methods, designed to improve
the fidelity of adiabatic quantum computing in the closed system setting,
remain beneficial in the open system setting. To address the high computational
cost of master equation simulations, we also demonstrate that a quantum Monte
Carlo algorithm that explicitly accounts for a thermal bosonic bath can be used
to interpolate between classical and quantum annealing. Our study highlights
and clarifies the significantly different role played by decoherence in the
adiabatic and circuit models of quantum computing.

compromise other hosts. To protect authorities and their clients proactively
from undetected exploits and misuse, we introduce CoSi, a scalable witness
cosigning protocol ensuring that every authoritative statement is validated and
publicly logged by a diverse group of witnesses before any client will accept
it. A statement S collectively signed by W witnesses assures clients that S has
been seen, and not immediately found erroneous, by those W observers. Even if S
is compromised in a fashion not readily detectable by the witnesses, CoSi still
guarantees S's exposure to public scrutiny, forcing secrecy-minded attackers to
risk that the compromise will soon be detected by one of the W witnesses.
Because clients can verify collective signatures efficiently without

transparency mechanism effective against persistent man-in-the-middle attackers
who control a victim's Internet access, the authority's secret key, and several
witnesses' secret keys. CoSi builds on existing cryptographic multisignature
methods, scaling them to support thousands of witnesses via signature
aggregation over efficient communication trees. A working prototype

inflation. In this way, the peak sets the energy scale at which the
inflationary phase has started. This energy scale must be consistent with the
energy scale found from the inflationary potential and with the scale found
from a potential observation of primordial gravitational waves. Demanding a
consistent history of the universe from its quantum origin to its present

constrain the parameter space of the underlying model of inflation. We
demonstrate our method by applying it to two models: Higgs inflation and

sources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mJy, and their
potential for being situated at high redshift. These ""cold"" Planck sources,
selected using the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) directly from the maps and
from the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS), all satisfy the criterion
of having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range
353 and 857 GHz. This colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift range
z=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (CIB).
We perform a dedicated Herschel-SPIRE follow-up of 234 such Planck targets,
finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison to
reference SPIRE fields. About 94% of the SPIRE sources in the Planck fields are
consistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. About 3% are
candidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopic
confirmations, placing them at redshifts z>2.2. The galaxy overdensities are
detected with high significance, half of the sample showing statistical
significance above 10sigma. The SPIRE photometric redshifts of galaxies in
overdensities suggest a peak at z~2. Under the Td=35K assumption, we derive an
infrared (IR) luminosity for each SPIRE source of about 4x10^12 Lsun, yielding
star formation rates of typically 700 Msun.yr^-1. If the observed overdensities
are actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formation
rates reaches 7x10^3 Msun.yr^-1. Taken together, these sources show the
signatures of high-z (z>$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.
All these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate the
ability of the all-sky Planck-HFI cold sources to select populations of
cosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

and high resolution images of the structure and morphology of coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere. CME directions and propagation
speeds have often been estimated through the use of time-elongation maps
obtained from the STEREO Heliospheric Imager (HI) data. Many of these CMEs have
been identified by citizen scientists working within the SolarStormWatch
project ( www.solarstormwatch.com ) as they work towards providing robust
real-time identification of Earth-directed CMEs. The wide field of view of HI
allows scientists to directly observe the two-dimensional (2D) structures,
while the relative simplicity of time-elongation analysis means that it can be
easily applied to many such events, thereby enabling a much deeper
understanding of how CMEs evolve between the Sun and the Earth. For events with
certain orientations, both the rear and front edges of the CME can be monitored
at varying heliocentric distances (R) between the Sun and 1 AU. Here we take
four example events with measurable position angle widths and identified by the
citizen scientists. These events were chosen for the clarity of their structure
within the HI cameras and their long track lengths in the time-elongation maps.
We show a linear dependency with R for the growth of the radial width (W) and
the 2D aspect ratio (X) of these CMEs, which are measured out to ~0.7 AU. We
estimated the radial width from a linear best fit for the average of the four
CMEs. We obtained the relationships W=0.14R+0.04 for the width and X=2.5R+0.86
for the aspect ratio (W and R in units of AU).

an extra director field, $\bf t$. It corresponds to a nematic ground state
exhibiting nanoscale periodic modulation. To demonstrate the stability of this
phase from the elastic point of view, a natural extension of the Frank elastic
energy density is proposed. The elastic energy density is built in terms of the
elements of symmetry of the new phase in which intervene the components of
these director fields together with the usual Cartesian tensors. It is shown
that the ground state corresponds to a deformed state for which $K_{22} >
K_{33}$. When the elastic free energy is interpreted in analogy with the Landau
theory, it is demonstrated the existence of a second order phase transition
between the usual and the twist-bend nematic phase, driven by a new elastic
parameter playing a role similar to the one of the main dielectric anisotropy
of classical nematics and being closely related to the bulk compression modulus

reliably over a discrete memoryless channel while simultaneously ensuring
covertness (low probability of detection) with respect to a warden, who
observes the signals through another discrete memoryless channel. We develop a
coding scheme based on the principle of channel resolvability, which
generalizes and extends prior work in several directions. First, it shows that,
irrespective of the quality of the channels, it is possible to communicate on
the order of $\sqrt{n}$ reliable and covert bits over $n$ channel uses if the
transmitter and the receiver share on the order of $\sqrt{n}$ key bits; this
improves upon earlier results requiring on the order of $\sqrt{n}\log n$ key
bits. Second, it proves that, if the receiver's channel is ""better"" than the
warden's channel in a sense that we make precise, it is possible to communicate
on the order of $\sqrt{n}$ reliable and covert bits over $n$ channel uses
without a secret key; this generalizes earlier results established for binary
symmetric channels. We also identify the fundamental limits of covert and
secret communications in terms of the optimal asymptotic scaling of the message
size and key size, and we extend the analysis to Gaussian channels. The main
technical problem that we address is how to develop concentration inequalities
for ""low-weight"" sequences; the crux of our approach is to define suitably
modified typical sets that are amenable to concentration inequalities.

concentric ring- or shell-like over-densities at large $R$ ($\approx$ 30 kpc)
and $Z$ ($\approx$ -10 kpc) in the Galactic halo that are thought to have been
formed from the accretion and disruption of a satellite galaxy. This paper
critically re-examines this formation scenario by comparing the number ratio of
RR Lyrae to M giant stars associated with the TriAnd clouds with other
structures in the Galaxy. The current data suggest a stellar population for
these over-densities ($f_{\rm RR:MG} < 0.38$ at 95% confidence) quite unlike
any of the known satellites of the Milky Way ($f_{\rm RR:MG} \approx 0.5$ for
the very largest and $f_{\rm RR:MG} >>1$ for the smaller satellites) and more
like the population of stars born in the much deeper potential well inhabited
by the Galactic disk ($f_{\rm RR:MG} < 0.01$). N-body simulations of a
Milky-Way-like galaxy perturbed by the impact of a dwarf galaxy demonstrate
that, in the right circumstances, concentric rings propagating outwards from
that Galactic disk can plausibly produce similar over-densities. These results
provide dramatic support for the recent proposal by Xu et al. (2015) that,
rather than stars accreted from other galaxies, the TriAnd clouds could
represent stars kicked-out from our own disk. If so, these would be the first
populations of disk stars to be found in the Galactic halo and a clear
signature of the importance of this second formation mechanism for stellar
halos more generally. Moreover, their existence at the very extremities of the
disk places strong constraints on the nature of the interaction that formed
them.

Rep","Scientific Reports 5, 13376 (2015)","10.1038/srep13376",,"physics.optics quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Combating the effects of disorder on light transport in micro- and
nano-integrated photonic devices is of major importance from both fundamental
and applied viewpoints. In ordinary waveguides, imperfections and disorder
cause unwanted back-reflections, which hinder large-scale optical integration.
Topological photonic structures, a new class of optical systems inspired by
quantum Hall effect and topological insulators, can realize robust transport
via topologically-protected unidirectional edge modes. Such waveguides are
realized by the introduction of synthetic gauge fields for photons in a
two-dimensional structure, which break time reversal symmetry and enable
one-way guiding at the edge of the medium. Here we suggest a different route
toward robust transport of light in lower-dimensional (1D) photonic lattices,
in which time reversal symmetry is broken because of the {\it non-Hermitian}
nature of transport. While a forward propagating mode in the lattice is
amplified, the corresponding backward propagating mode is damped, thus
resulting in an asymmetric transport that is rather insensitive to disorder or
imperfections in the structure. Non-Hermitian transport in two lattice models
is considered: a tight-binding lattice with an imaginary gauge field
(Hatano-Nelson model), and a non-Hermitian driven binary lattice. In the former
case transport in spite of disorder is ensured by a mobility edge that arises
because of a non-Hermitian delocalization transition. The possibility to
observe non-Hermitian delocalization induced by a synthetic 'imaginary' gauge
field is suggested using an engineered coupled-resonator optical waveguide
(CROW) structure.

bound, and the three most promising star forming cores have a virial parameter
smaller than 1 even taking magnetic field into account. We also associate the
cores with star formation activities revealed by outflows, masers, or infrared

beam optical dipole traps for precision force measurement in high vacuum with
long averaging times, and enables future applications including the study of
gravitational inverse square law violations at short range, Casimir forces,

computation. Advantages exist in using qudits, d-level quantum systems, as the
basic carrier of quantum information. We show that color codes, a class of
topological quantum codes with remarkable transversality properties, can be
generalized to the qudit paradigm. In recent developments it was found that in
three spatial dimensions a qubit color code can support a transversal
non-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional
non-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and K\""onig's bound [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 110, 170503 (2013)]. Furthermore, by using gauge fixing techniques,
an effective set of Clifford gates can be achieved, removing the need for state
distillation. We show that the qudit color code can support the qudit analogues
of these gates, and show that in higher spatial dimensions a color code can
support a phase gate from higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy which can be
proven to saturate Bravyi and K\""onig's bound in all but a finite number of
special cases. The methodology used is a generalisation of Bravyi and Haah's
method of triorthogonal matrices [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], which may be
of independent interest. For completeness, we show explicitly that the qudit
color codes generalize to gauge color codes, and share the many of the
favorable properties of their qubit counterparts.

very large extra-dimension cut-off scale. One is the type-I seesaw mechanism
and the other is the overlap integration of localized lepton wave functions. A
singlet scalar with an exponential-like VEV plays a central role in these two
mechanisms. For consistency in this model we introduce a $U(1)'$ gauge
symmetry, which will be broken by the singlet scalar. Parameters of our model
can fit the masses and flavor mixing data well. These parameters can also
predict all CP violating phases including the Majorana ones and accidentally

The standard classification of the extremals into normal and abnormal ones is
discussed, pointing out the existence of an algebraic algorithm assigning to
each admissible curve a corresponding abnormality index, related to the co-rank
of a suitable linear map. Attention is then shifted to the study of the first

the simulation and analysis pipeline used by the Planck satellite experiment

bispectrum (or three-point correlator) of the cosmic microwave background
radiation. We focus on one particular element of the code: the projection of
bispectra from the end of inflation to the spherical shell at decoupling, which
defines the CMB we observe today. This code involves a three-dimensional inner
product between two functions, one of which requires an integral, on a
non-rectangular domain containing a sparse grid. We show that by employing
separable methods this calculation can be reduced to a one-dimensional
summation plus two integrations, reducing the overall dimensionality from four
to three. The introduction of separable functions also solves the issue of the
non-rectangular sparse grid. This separable method can become unstable in
certain cases and so the slower non-separable integral must be calculated
instead. We present a discussion of the optimisation of both approaches. We
show significant speed-ups of ~100x, arising from a combination of algorithmic
improvements and architecture-aware optimisations targeted at improving thread
and vectorisation behaviour. The resulting MPI/OpenMP hybrid code is capable of
executing on clusters containing processors and/or coprocessors, with
strong-scaling efficiency of 98.6% on up to 16 nodes. We find that a single
coprocessor outperforms two processor sockets by a factor of 1.3x and that
running the same code across a combination of both microarchitectures improves
performance-per-node by a factor of 3.38x. By making bispectrum calculations
competitive with those for the power spectrum (or two-point correlator) we are
now able to consider joint analysis for cosmological science exploitation of
new data.

inspired by the familiar game of Cops and Robbers. In Zombies and Survivors, a
set of zombies attempts to eat a lone survivor loose on a given graph. The
zombies randomly choose their initial location, and during the course of the
game, move directly toward the survivor. At each round, they move to the
neighbouring vertex that minimizes the distance to the survivor; if there is
more than one such vertex, then they choose one uniformly at random. The
survivor attempts to escape from the zombies by moving to a neighbouring vertex
or staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if eventually one of them
eats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise, the survivor wins. The
zombie number of a graph is the minimum number of zombies needed to play such
that the probability that they win is strictly greater than 1/2. We present
asymptotic results for the zombie numbers of several graph families, such as
cycles, hypercubes, incidence graphs of projective planes, and Cartesian and

large fiducial mass of the T2K $\pi^0$ detector. The predominant poriton of the
$\nu_e$ flux ($\sim$85 %) at these energies comes from kaon decays. The
measured ratio of the observed beam interaction rate to the predicted rate in
the detector with water targets filled is 0.89 $\pm$ 0.08 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.11
(sys.), and with the water targets emptied is 0.90 $\pm$ 0.09 (stat.) $\pm$
0.13 (sys.). The ratio obtained for the interactions on water only from an
event subtraction method is 0.87 $\pm$ 0.33 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.21 (sys.). This is
the first measurement of the interaction rate of electron neutrinos on water,
which is particularly of interest to experiments with water Cherenkov
detectors.

boson, commonly known as the Glashow resonance, can be initiated in matter only
by the electron antineutrino in the process $\bar\nu_ee^-\rightarrow W^-$ at
the laboratory energy around~6.3~PeV. In this paper we argue that the Glashow
resonance within the Standard Model also occurs in neutrino--nucleus
collisions. The main conclusions are as follows. 1)~The Glashow resonance can
be excited by both~neutrinos and~antineutrinos of all the three flavors
scattering in the Coulomb field of a nucleus. 2)~The Glashow resonance in a
neutrino--nucleus reaction does not manifest itself as a Breit--Wigner-like
peak in the cross section but the latter exhibits instead a slow
logarithmic-law growth with the neutrino energy. The resonance turns thus out
to be hidden. 3)~More than~$98\%$ of~$W$ bosons produced in the sub-PeV region
in neutrino-initiated reactions in water/ice will be from the Glashow
resonance. 4)~The vast majority of the Glashow resonance events in a neutrino
detector is expected at energies from a few TeV to a few tens of TeV, being
mostly initiated by the conventional atmospheric neutrinos dominant in this
energy range. Calculations of the cross sections for Glashow resonance
excitation on the oxygen nucleus as well as on the proton are carried out in
detail. The results of this paper can be useful for studies of neutrino
interactions at large volume water/ice neutrino detectors. For example, in the
IceCube detector one can expect~0.3 Glashow resonance events with shower-like
topologies and the deposited energies above~$300~\text{TeV}$ per year. It is
therefore likely already to have at least one Glashow resonance event in the
IceCube data set.

demanding and challenging to perform on a large number of targets. Our intent
is to perform for the first time a peak bagging analysis on a sample of 19
low-mass low-luminosity red giants observed by Kepler for more than four years.
This allows us to provide high-quality asteroseismic measurements that can be
exploited for an intensive testing of the physics used in stellar structure
models, stellar evolution and pulsation codes, as well as for refining existing
asteroseismic scaling relations in the red giant branch regime. For this
purpose, powerful and sophisticated analysis tools are needed. We exploit the
Bayesian code Diamonds, using an efficient nested sampling Monte Carlo
algorithm, to perform both a fast fitting of the individual oscillation modes
and a peak detection test based on the Bayesian evidence. We find good
agreement for the parameters estimated in the background fitting phase with
those given in the literature. We extract and characterize a total of 1618
oscillation modes, providing the largest set of detailed asteroseismic mode
measurements ever published. We report on the evidence of a change in regime
observed in the relation between linewidths and effective temperatures of the
stars occurring at the bottom of the RGB. We show the presence of a linewidth
depression or plateau around $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ for all the red giants of the
sample. Lastly, we show a good agreement between our measurements of maximum
mode amplitudes and existing maximum amplitudes from global analyses provided
in the literature, useful as empirical tools to improve and simplify the future
peak bagging analysis on a larger sample of evolved stars.

substructures of galaxy clusters from optical redshift data alone. The caustic
technique is designed to estimate the mass profile of galaxy clusters to radii
well beyond the virial radius, where dynamical equilibrium does not hold. Two
by-products of this technique are the identification of the cluster members and
the identification of the cluster substructures. We test the caustic technique
as a substructure detector on two samples of 150 mock redshift surveys of
clusters; the clusters are extracted from a large cosmological $N$-body
simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM model and have masses of $M_{200} \sim 10^{14}
h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{200} \sim 10^{15} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ in the two

with 200 galaxies within $3R_{200}$, (1) the caustic technique recovers $\sim
30-50$\% of the real substructures, and (2) $\sim 15-20$\% of the substructures
identified by the caustic technique correspond to real substructures of the

substructures of clusters in the surrounding region, or chance alignments of
unrelated galaxies. These encouraging results show that the caustic technique

cosmological information it has become crucial to understand the Large Scale
Structures (LSS) of the universe to percent accuracy. The Effective Field
Theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) is a novel theoretical framework that aims to develop
an analytic understanding of LSS at long distances, where inhomogeneities are
small. We further develop the description of biased tracers in the EFTofLSS to
account for the effect of baryonic physics and primordial non-Gaussianities,
finding that new bias coefficients are required. Then, restricting to dark
matter with Gaussian initial conditions, we describe the prediction of the
EFTofLSS for the one-loop halo-halo and halo-matter two-point functions, and
for the tree-level halo-halo-halo, matter-halo-halo and matter-matter-halo
three-point functions. Several new bias coefficients are needed in the
EFTofLSS, even though their contribution at a given order can be degenerate and
the same parameters contribute to multiple observables. We develop a method to
reduce the number of biases to an irreducible basis, and find that, at the
order at which we work, seven bias parameters are enough to describe this
extremely rich set of statistics. We then compare with the output of $N$-body
simulations. For the lowest mass bin, we find percent level agreement up to
$k\simeq 0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for the one-loop two-point functions, and up
to $k\simeq 0.15\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for the tree-level three-point functions,
with the $k$-reach decreasing with higher mass bins. This is consistent with
the theoretical estimates, and suggests that the cosmological information in
LSS amenable to analytical control is much more than previously believed.

Mecl, by means of direct N -body calculations. We include diverse initial
conditions by varying the half-mass radius, initial mass-segregation, initial
binary fraction and orbital parameters of the massive binaries. The results
show robustly that the ejection fraction of O star systems exhibits a maximum
at a cluster mass of $10^{3.5}$ Msun for all models, even though the number of
the ejected systems increases with cluster mass. We show that lower mass
clusters (Mecl ~ 400 Msun ) are the dominant sources for populating the
Galactic field with O stars by dynamical ejections, considering the mass
function of embedded clusters. About 15 per cent (up to 38 per cent, depending
on the cluster models) of O stars of which a significant fraction are binaries,
and which would have formed in a 10 Myr epoch of star formation in a
distribution of embedded clusters, will be dynamically ejected to the field.
Individual clusters may eject 100 per cent of their original O star content. A
large fraction of such O stars have velocities up to only 10 km/s. Synthesising
a young star cluster mass function it follows, given the stellar-dynamical
results presented here, that the observed fractions of field and runaway O
stars, and the binary fractions among them can be well understood theoretically

(the 1.5-m Loiano Telescope and the 3.6-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo)
instruments. The X-ray spectrum of Sw J2014 can be described by a hard and
highly absorbed power law. The optical observations made it possible to single
out the optical counterpart to this source, which displays several variable
emission lines and total eclipses lasting ~20 min. Total eclipses of similar
length were observed also in X-rays. The study of the eclipses, allowed us to
infer a second periodicity of 3.44 h, which we interpret as the orbital period
of a close binary system. We also found that the period has not significantly
changed over a ~7 yr timespan. Based on the timing signatures of Sw J2014, and
its optical and X-ray spectral properties, we suggest that it is a close binary
hosting an accreting magnetic white dwarf. The system is therefore a
cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar type and one of the very few

We confirm previous results suggesting a correlation between color and age for
quiescent galaxies, finding mean ages of $1.22^{+0.56}_{-0.19}$ Gyr and
$0.85^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ Gyr for the reddest and bluest galaxies in our sample.
Combining our KMOS measurements with those obtained from previous studies at
$0.2 < z < 2$ we find evidence for a $2-3$ Gyr spread in the formation epoch of
massive galaxies. At $z < 1$ the measured stellar ages are consistent with
passive evolution, while at $1 < z \lesssim2$ they appear to saturate at
$\sim$1 Gyr, which likely reflects changing demographics of the (mean)
progenitor population. By comparing to star-formation histories inferred for
""normal"" star-forming galaxies, we show that the timescales required to form

minimal surfaces can be static and compact. We use the blackfold approach in

uncover several new configurations, such as black helicoids and catenoids, some

the ultraspinning regime of singly-spinning Myers-Perry black holes, described
in terms of the simplest minimal surface (the plane), can be obtained as a

monopole of the redshift space halo correlation function is well described by
the GSM, higher multipoles improve upon including the leading order
non-Gaussian correction in the ESM: the GSM quadrupole breaks down on scales
below 30 Mpc/h whereas the ESM stays accurate to 2% within statistical errors
down to 10 Mpc/h. To predict the scale dependent functions entering the
streaming model we employ Convolution Lagrangian perturbation theory (CLPT)
based on the dust model and local Lagrangian bias. Since dark matter halos
carry an intrinsic length scale given by their Lagrangian radius, we extend
CLPT to the coarse-grained dust model and consider two different smoothing
approaches operating in Eulerian and Lagrangian space, respectively. The
coarse-graining in Eulerian space features modified fluid dynamics different
from dust while the coarse-graining in Lagrangian space is performed in the
initial conditions with subsequent single streaming dust dynamics, implemented
by smoothing the initial power spectrum in the spirit of the truncated
Zel'dovich approximation. Finally, we compare the predictions of the different
coarse-grained models for the streaming model ingredients to N-body
measurements and comment on the proper choice of both the tracer distribution

Telescope narrowband Ha images of T Pyx . The flash of radiation from the nova
event had no effect on the ejecta until at least 55 days after the eruption

was seen 132 days after the beginning of the eruption. That hydrogen recombined
in the following 51 days, allowing us to determine a hydrogen atom density of
at least 7e5 cm^-3 - at least an order of magnitude denser than the previously
detected, unresolved [NII] knots surrounding T Pyx. Material to the northwest

outburst) and 101 days later, we detected almost no trace of hydrogen emission

hydrogen overlapping the previously detected, [NII] - emitting knots of T Pyx
ejecta. The mass of this newly detected hydrogen is probably an order of
magnitude larger than that of the [NII] knots. We also determine that there is
no significant reservoir of undetected ejecta from the outer boundaries of the
previously detected ejecta out to about twice that distance, near the plane of
the sky. The lack of distant ejecta is consistent with the Schaefer et al

within five years of 1866 after many millennia of quiescence, followed by the
six observed recurrent nova eruptions since 1890. This lack of distant ejecta
is not consistent with scenarios in which T Pyx has been erupting continuously

literature only took a layer wise training without any post fine tuning. We
empirically show that global training with BP outperforms layer-wise

which utilized sparse connection to learn local image feature representation.

extending CPR-GTN to 3D pose estimation by doing experiments using 3D Computed

have measured Si II, Cr II, and Zn II from new HST COS observations. We have
combined these measurements with H I and H$_2$ column densities and reference
stellar abundances from the literature to derive gas-phase abundances,
depletions, and gas-to-dust ratios (GDRs). 80 of our 84 P measurements and 13
of our 16 Zn measurements are depleted by more than 0.1 decades, suggesting
that P and Zn abundances are not accurate metallicity indicators at and above
the metallicity of the SMC. The maximum P and Zn depletions are the same in the
MW, LMC, and SMC. Si, Cr, and Fe are systematically less depleted in the SMC
than in the MW or LMC. The minimum Si depletion in the SMC is consistent with
zero. Our depletion-derived GDRs broadly agree with GDRs from the literature.
The GDR varies from location to location within a galaxy by a factor of up to 2
in the LMC and up to 5 in the SMC. This variation is evidence of dust
destruction and/or growth in the diffuse neutral phase of the interstellar
medium.

  free-viewing fixations",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting where people look in natural scenes has attracted a lot of
interest in computer vision and computational neuroscience over the past two
decades. Two seemingly contrasting categories of cues have been proposed to
influence where people look: \textit{low-level image saliency} and
\textit{high-level semantic information}. Our first contribution is to take a
detailed look at these cues to confirm the hypothesis proposed by
Henderson~\cite{henderson1993eye} and Nuthmann \&
Henderson~\cite{nuthmann2010object} that observers tend to look at the center
of objects. We analyzed fixation data for scene free-viewing over 17 observers
on 60 fully annotated images with various types of objects. Images contained
different types of scenes, such as natural scenes, line drawings, and 3D
rendered scenes. Our second contribution is to propose a simple combined model
of low-level saliency and object center-bias that outperforms each individual
component significantly over our data, as well as on the OSIE dataset by Xu et
al.~\cite{xu2014predicting}. The results reconcile saliency with object
center-bias hypotheses and highlight that both types of cues are important in
guiding fixations. Our work opens new directions to understand strategies that
humans use in observing scenes and objects, and demonstrates the construction
of combined models of low-level saliency and high-level object-based
information.

dictionary learning and other practical problems, is to recover both $A$ and
$X$, given $Y$. Under normal circumstances, it is clear that this problem is
underdetermined. However, in the case when $X$ is sparse and random, Spielman,
Wang and Wright showed that one can recover both $A$ and $X$ efficiently from
$Y$ with high probability, given that $p$ (the number of samples) is
sufficiently large. Their method works for $p \ge C n^2 \log^ 2 n$ and they
conjectured that $p \ge C n \log n$ suffices. The bound $n \log n$ is sharp for
an obvious information theoretical reason.
  In this paper, we show that $p \ge C n \log^4 n$ suffices, matching the
conjectural bound up to a polylogarithmic factor. The core of our proof is a
theorem concerning $l_1$ concentration of random matrices, which is of
independent interest.
  Our proof of the concentration result is based on two ideas. The first is an
economical way to apply the union bound. The second is a refined version of
Bernstein's concentration inequality for the sum of independent variables. Both
have nothing to do with random matrices and are applicable in general settings.

prediction and analysis across many disciplines. We will reformulate these in
terms of linear maps. This reformulation will suggest a natural extension,
which we will show is equivalent to standard textbook quantum mechanics.
Therefore, this extension will be termed ""quantum"". However, the term ""quantum""
should not be taken to imply this extension is necessarily only of utility in
situations traditionally thought of as in the domain of quantum mechanics. In
principle, it may be employed in any modeling situation, say forecasting the
weather or the stock market--it is up to experiment to determine if this
extension is useful in practice. Even restricting to the domain of quantum
mechanics, with this new formulation the advantages of Bayesian networks can be
maintained for models incorporating quantum and mixed classical-quantum
behavior. The use of these will be illustrated by various basic examples.
  Parrondo's paradox refers to the situation where two, multi-round games with
a fixed winning criteria, both with probability greater than one-half for one
player to win, are combined. Using a possibly biased coin to determine the rule
to employ for each round, paradoxically, the previously losing player now wins
the combined game with probability greater than one-half. Using the extended
Bayesian networks, we will formulate and analyze classical observed, classical
hidden, and quantum versions of a game that displays this paradox, finding
bounds for the discrepancy from naive expectations for the occurrence of the
paradox. A quantum paradox inspired by Parrondo's paradox will also be
analyzed. We will prove a bound for the discrepancy from naive expectations for
this paradox as well. Games involving quantum walks that achieve this bound
will be presented.

fresh plasma, our analysis shows that the instability grows spatially from the
beam front to the back up to a certain critical beam length; then the
instability acquires a purely temporal growth. This critical beam length
increases linearly with time and in the non-relativistic regime it is
proportional to the beam velocity. In the relativistic regime the critical
length is inversely proportional to the cube of the beam Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{0b}$. Thus, in the ultra-relativistic regime the instability
immediately acquires a purely temporal growth all over the beam. The analytical

the reason, a rewriting of the functional form of the +U corrections is
presented that leads to a more physical and transparent understanding of the
effect of these correction terms. The approach highlights the importance of
Hund's coupling (intra-orbital exchange) in providing anisotropy across the
occupation and energy eigenvalues of the Mn d states. This intra-orbital
exchange is the key to fully activating the Jahn-Teller distortion, reproducing
the experimental band gap and stabilizing the correct magnetic ground state in
LaMnO$_{3}$. The best parameter values for LaMnO$_{3}$ within the DFT (PBEsol)
+U framework are determined to be U = 8 eV and J = 1.9 eV.

Instead the spectra display prominent broad double-peaked Halpha emission and
weaker HeI emission lines. From the Halpha peak-to-peak separation we constrain
the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to > 789 km/s. Further
analysis through radial velocity and equivalent width measurements indicates
that the Halpha line is free of variability due to S-wave components or disc
eclipses. From our data and previous observations during outburst, we conclude
that long-term radial velocity changes ascribed to a precessing disc were of
low amplitude or not present. This implies that the centroid position of the
line should closely represent the systemic radial velocity. Using the derived
systemic velocity of -150 km/s and the best available limits on the source
distance, we infer that the black hole is moving towards the Plane in its
current Galactic orbit unless the proper motion is substantial. Finally, the
depth of the central absorption in the double peaked profiles adds support for
Swift J1357.2-0933 as a high-inclination system. On the other hand, we argue
that the low hydrogen column density inferred from X-ray fitting suggests that

We explain existing rollback schemes by assigning a logical time to each event

system rolls back by selecting a set of logical times for each processor. The
effect of events at times within the set is retained or restored from saved
state, while the effect of other events is undone and re-executed. We show
that, by adopting different logical time ""domains"" at different processors, an
application can adopt appropriate checkpointing schemes for different parts of
its computation. We illustrate with an example of an application that combines
batch processing with low-latency streaming updates. We show rules, and an
algorithm, to determine a globally consistent state for rollback in a system
that uses multiple logical time domains. We also introduce selective rollback
at a processor, which can selectively preserve the effect of events at some
logical times and not others, independent of the original order of execution of
those events. Selective rollback permits new checkpointing policies that are

SIS model whose basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0 $ is computed as a
function of a patch residence-times matrix $\mathbb P$. Our analysis implies
that the resulting $n$-patch SIS model has robust dynamics when patches are
strongly connected: there is a globally stable endemic equilibrium when
$\mathcal R_0>1 $ while the disease free equilibrium is globally stable when
$\mathcal R_0\leq1 $. Our further analysis indicates that the dispersal
behavior described by the residence-times matrix $\mathbb P$ has profound
effects on the disease dynamics at the single patch level with consequences
that proper dispersal behavior along with the local environmental risk can
either promote or eliminate the endemic in particular patches. Our work
highlights the impact of residence times matrix if the patches are not strongly
connected. Our framework can be generalized in other endemic and disease
outbreak models. As an illustration, we apply our framework to a two-patch SIR

evolved the primary stars with different initial orbital periods using the
binary module in MESA (version 6208) from zero age main-sequence (ZAMS) to post

compared with the observation. The results are consistent with observation in
the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and the logg-Teff plane for NGC 2808, which
is an example GC hosting BHk stars. However, the helium abundance in the
surface for our models is higher than the one obtained in BHk stars. This
discrepancy between our models and observation is possibly due to the fact that
gravitational settling and radiative levitation which are common processes in
hot HB stars are not considered in the models as well as the fact that the
flash mixing efficiency may be overestimated in the calculations. Our results
suggested that tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution is able to

(AGNs) and galaxies at redshift 0.1-1.0 for investigating properties of
galaxies associated with the AGNs, revealing the nature of fueling mechanism of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We used 8059 SDSS AGNs/QSOs for which virial
masses of individual SMBHs were measured, and divided them into four mass
groups. Cross-correlation analysis was performed and bias for each mass group
was derived. The averaged color and luminosity distributions of galaxies around
the AGNs/QSOs were also derived for each mass group. The galaxy color was
estimated for SED constructed from a merged SDSS and UKIDSS catalog. The
distributions of color and luminosity were derived by the subtraction method,
which does not require redshift information of galaxies. The main results of
this work are: (1) a bias increases by a factor two from the lower mass group
to the highest mass group; (2) the environment around AGNs with the most
massive SMBH (Mbh > 10^9 Msun) is dominated by red sequence galaxies; (3)
marginal indication of decline in luminosity function at dimmer side of M >
-19.5 mag is found for galaxies around AGNs with Mbh = 10^8.2 - 10^9 Msun and
nearest redshift group (z=0.1-0.3). These results indicate that AGNs with the
most massive SMBHs reside in haloes where large fraction of galaxies have been
transited to the red sequence. The accretion of hot halo gas as well as
recycled gas from evolving stars can be the most plausible mechanism to fuel
the SMBHs above ~10^9 Msun.

  Broadband Light Absorption in Graphene Optoelectronic Devices",,,"10.1364/OE.23.021809",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A general metallic mirror (i.e., a flat metallic surface) has been a popular
optical component that can contribute broadband light absorption to thin-film
optoelectronic devices; nonetheless, such electric mirror with a reversal of
reflection phase inevitably causes the problem of minimized electric field near
at the mirror surface (maximized electric field at one quarter of wavelength
from mirror). This problem becomes more elucidated, when the
deep-subwavelength-scaled two-dimensional (2D) material (e.g., graphene and
molybdenum disulfide) is implemented into optoelectronic device as an active
channel layer. The purpose of this work was to conceive the idea for using a
charge storage layer (spherical Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), embedded into
dielectric matrix) of the floating-gate graphene photodetector as a magnetic
mirror, which allows the device to harness the increase in broadband light
absorption. In particular, we systematically examined whether the versatile
assembly of spherical AuNP monolayer within a dielectric matrix (i.e., optical
metamaterial mirror), which should be designed to be placed right below the
graphene channel layer for floating-gate device, can be indeed treated as the
effective magnetic mirror. In addition to being capable of the enhancement of
broadband light absorption, versatile access to various structural motifs of
AuNPs benefitting from recent advances in chemical synthesis promises
compelling opportunities for sophisticated engineering of optical metamaterial
mirror. High amenability of the AuNP assembly with the semiconductor-related
procedures may make this strategy widely applicable to various thin film
optoelectronic devices. Our study thereby illustrates advantages in advancing
the design of mirror for rational engineering of light-matter interaction
within deep-subwavelength-scaled optoelectronic devices.

account for the temperature dependence of SMR by assuming a temperature

width of the annulus and strength of the magnetic field, in particular, we
focus on the phase slip and superflow. Then we consider the coupled Bose gas
system in a magnetic field. In a strong magnetic field, vortices form a
Abrikosov triangular lattice in both Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and
locations of vortices in the BECs correlate with each other by the Rabi
coupling. However, as the strength of the Rabi coupling is increased, vortices
start to vibrate around their equilibrium locations. As the strength is
increased further, vortices in the harmonic trap start to move along the
boundaries of the annulus. Finally for a large Rabi coupling, the BECs are
destroyed. Based on our findings about the BEC in the annular trap, we discuss
the origin of above mentioned phenomena.

recent algorithm that uses a non-deterministic gradient descent search to
decode low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The proposed re-decode procedure
obtains improved performance because the perturbations are independent at each
re-decoding phase, therefore increasing the likelihood of successful decoding.
We examine the benefits of re-decoding for an LDPC code from the IEEE 802.3an

hypotheses when the individual test statistics are not necessarily independent.
Specifically, we consider the problem of simultaneous testing of point null
hypotheses against two-sided alternatives for the mean parameters of normally
distributed random variables. We assume that conditionally given the vector of
means, these random variables jointly follow a multivariate normal distribution
with a known but arbitrary covariance matrix. We consider a Bayesian framework
where each unknown mean parameter is modeled through a two-component ""spike and
slab"" mixture prior. This way, unconditionally the test statistics jointly have
a mixture of multivariate normal distributions. A new testing procedure is
developed that uses the dependence among the test statistics and works in a
""step-down"" manner. This procedure is general enough to be applied for
non-normal data. A decision theoretic justification in favor of the proposed
testing procedure has been provided by showing that unlike many traditional
p-value based stepwise procedures, this new method possesses a certain
""convexity property"" which makes it admissible with respect to a vector risk
function that captures the risks for the individual testing problems. An
alternative representation of the proposed test statistics has also been
established resulting in great simplification in the computational complexity.
It is demonstrated through extensive simulations that for various forms of
dependence and a wide range of sparsity levels, the proposed testing procedure
compares quite favorably with several existing multiple testing procedures
available in the literature in terms of overall misclassification probability.

interpretation inspired from Hughes-vanGlabbeek (HvG) proof-nets for

geometric correctness criterion-the toggling cycle condition-in terms of
algebraic operators. Our new ingredient is a scalar extension of the *-algebra
in Girard's *-ring of partial isometries over a boolean polynomial ring with
literals of eigenweights as indeterminates. In order to capture feedback
arising from cuts, we construct a finer grained execution formula. The
expansion of this execution formula is longer than that for collections of
slices for multiplicative GoI, hence it is harder to prove termination. Our GoI
gives a dynamical, semantical account of boolean valuations (in particular,
pruning sub-proofs), conversion of weights (in particular, alpha-conversion),
and additive (co)contraction, peculiar to additive proof-theory. Termination of
our execution formula is shown to correspond to HvG's toggling criterion. The
slice-wise restriction of our execution formula (by collapsing the boolean
structure) yields the well known correspondence, explicit or implicit in
previous works on multiplicative GoI, between the convergence of execution
formulas and acyclicity of proof-nets. Feedback arising from the execution
formula by restricting to the boolean polynomial structure yields autonomous
definability of eigenweights among cuts from the rest of the eigenweights.

larger at the grid points near a boundary or grid interface than that in the

are gained from the large truncation error. However, many interesting second

operation at the relay with nested lattice encoding at the source is proposed.
For this system with full channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT),
theoretical analysis shows that the proposed MF scheme approaches the secrecy
capacity within 1/2 bit for any channel realization, and hence achieves full
generalized security degrees of freedom (G-SDoF). In contrast, the AF scheme
can only achieve a small fraction of the G-SDoF. For this system without any

outage, is introduced. Based on this total outage definition, analysis shows
that the proposed MF scheme achieves the full generalized secure diversity gain

of superpartners have lead to concerns that supersymmetric models are now fine
tuned. Large stop masses, required for a 125 GeV Higgs, feed into the
electroweak symmetry breaking conditions through renormalisation group
equations forcing one to fine tune these parameters to obtain the correct
electroweak vacuum expectation value. Nonetheless this fine tuning depends
crucially on our assumptions about the supersymmetry breaking scale. At the
same time $U(1)$ extensions provide the most compelling solution to the
$\mu$-problem, which is also a naturalness issue, and allow the tree level
Higgs mass to be raised substantially above $M_Z$. These very well motivated
supersymmetric models predict a new $Z'$ boson which could be discovered at the
LHC and the naturalness of the model requires that the $Z'$ boson mass should
not be too far above the TeV scale. Moreover this fine tuning appears at the
tree level, making it less dependent on assumptions about the supersymmetry
breaking mechanism. Here we study this fine tuning for several $U(1)$
supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model and compare it to the situation
in the MSSM where the most direct tree level fine tuning can be probed through
chargino mass limits. We show that future LHC $Z'$ searches are extremely
important for challenging the most natural scenarios in these models.

D 83, 121502(R) (2011)], a new kind
of metric ansatz was found to fairly describe all already known black hole
solutions in the ungauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) supergravity theories. That metric
ansatz somewhat resembles to the famous Kerr-Schild (KS) form, but it is
different from the KS one in two distinct aspects. That is, apart from a global
conformal factor, the metric ansatz can be written as a vacuum background
spacetime plus a ""perturbation"" modification term, the latter of which is
associated with a timelike geodesic vector field rather than a null geodesic
congruence in the usual KS ansatz. In this paper, we shall study this novel
metric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the
construction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other
gauged supergravity theories. In order to investigate the metric properties of
the general KK-AdS solutions, in this paper we devise a new effective method,
dubbed the background metric expansion method, which can be thought of as a
generalization of the perturbation expansion method, to deal with the
Lagrangian and all equations of motion. In addition to two previously known
conditions, namely the timelike and geodesic properties of the vector, we get
the three additional constraints via contracting the Maxwell and Einstein
equations once or twice with this timelike geodesic vector. In particular, we
find that these are a simple set of sufficient conditions to determine the
vector and the dilaton scalar around the background metric, which is helpful in
obtaining new exact solutions. With these five simplified equations in hand, we
rederive the general rotating charged KK-(A)dS black hole solutions with
spherical horizon topology and obtain new solutions with planar topology in all
dimensions.

fragmentation in gas as well as its dependence on the adopted 3-body H$_2$
formation rate. We find that the fragmentation behaviour of the gas is only
marginally effected by the choice of 3-body rate co-efficient, and that
halo-to-halo differences are of equal importance in affecting the final mass
distribution of stars.

  Channels",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present paper, we propose a broadcast ARQ protocol based on the
concept of index coding. In the proposed scenario, a server wishes to transmit
a finite sequence of packets to multiple receivers via a broadcast channel with
packet erasures until all of the receivers successfully receive all of the
packets. In the retransmission phase, the server produces a coded packet as a
retransmitted packet based on the side-information sent from the receivers via
feedback channels. A notable feature of the proposed protocol is that the
decoding process at the receiver side has low decoding complexity because only
a small number of addition operations are needed in order to recover an
intended packet. This feature may be preferable for reducing the power
consumption of receivers. The throughput performance of the proposed protocol
is close to that of the ideal FEC throughput performance when the erasure
probability is less than $0.1$. This implies that the proposed protocol
provides almost optimal throughput performance in such a regime.

incorporates the effects of both linear interference from adjacent bit-cells

During these eras, cosmological perturbations on small scales can enter and
re-exit the horizon, modifying the power spectrum on those scales. The largest
modified scale, $k_\mathrm{b}$, touches the horizon size when the expansion
changes from deflation to inflation at the transition from moduli domination to
thermal inflation. We analytically calculate the evolution of perturbations
from moduli domination through thermal inflation and evaluate the curvature

thermal inflation to determine the late time curvature perturbation. Our
resulting transfer function suppresses the power spectrum by a factor $\sim 50$

lines, yielding a broadening of the red wing of the resonance lines. The
contribution of such satellite lines may be important, because of the high
degeneracy of the relevant excited configurations which give these large
Boltzmann weights. However, it is in general difficult to take these
configurations into account since they are likely to give rise to a large

in a way similar to the Partially-Resolved-Transition-Array approach recently
published by C. Iglesias. It consists in a partial detailed-line-accounting
calculation in which the effect of the Rydberg spectators is included through a
shift and width, expressed in terms of the canonical partition functions, which
are key-ingredients of the Super-Transition-Arrays model. The resulting method

diagnostics. We consider two interacting forms for the models, i.e., $Q_1=\beta

coupling parameter. Our focus is the I$\Lambda$CDM model that is a
one-parameter extension to $\Lambda$CDM by considering a direct coupling
between the vacuum energy ($\Lambda$) and cold dark matter (CDM), with the only
additional parameter $\beta$. But we begin with a more general case by
considering the I$w$CDM model in which dark energy has a constant $w$
(equation-of-state parameter). For calculating the growth rate of structure, we
employ the ""parametrized post-Friedmann"" theoretical framework for interacting
dark energy to numerically obtain the $\epsilon(z)$ values for the models. We
show that in both geometrical and structural diagnostics the impact of $w$ is
much stronger than that of $\beta$ in the I$w$CDM model. We thus wish to have a
closer look at the I$\Lambda$CDM model by combining the geometrical and
structural diagnostics. We find that the evolutionary trajectories in the
$S^{(1)}_3$--$\epsilon$ plane exhibit distinctive features and the departures
from $\Lambda$CDM could be well evaluated, theoretically, indicating that the
composite null diagnostic $\{S^{(1)}_3, \epsilon\}$ is a promising tool for
investigating the interacting dark energy models.

studied in detail with spectroscopic stellar data as well as an estimate of the
ongoing star formation rate. The aims of this paper are to study the chemical
evolution of the GC region by means of a detailed chemical evolution model and
to compare the results with high resolution spectroscopic data in order to
impose constraints on the GC formation history.The chemical evolution model
assumes that the GC region formed by fast infall of gas and then follows the
evolution of alpha-elements and Fe. We test different initial mass functions
(IMFs), efficiencies of star formation and gas infall timescales. To reproduce
the currently observed star formation rate, we assume a late episode of star
formation triggered by gas infall/accretion. We find that, in order to
reproduce the [alpha/Fe] ratios as well as the metallicity distribution
function observed in GC stars, the GC region should have experienced a main
early strong burst of star formation, with a star formation efficiency as high
as 25 Gyr^{-1}, occurring on a timescale in the range 0.1-0.7 Gyr, in agreement
with previous models of the entire bulge. Although the small amount of data
prevents us from drawing firm conclusions, we suggest that the best IMF should
contain more massive stars than expected in the solar vicinity, and the last
episode of star formation, which lasted several hundred million years, should
have been triggered by a modest episode of gas infall/accretion, with a star
formation efficiency similar to that of the previous main star formation
episode. This last episode of star formation produces negligible effects on the
abundance patterns and can be due to accretion of gas induced by the bar. Our
results exclude an important infall event as a trigger for the last starburst.

Hall (QSH) insulators, are excellent candidates for coherent spin transport
related applications because the edge states of 2D TIs are robust against
nonmagnetic impurities since the only available backscattering channel is
forbidden. Currently, most known 2D TIs are based on a hexagonal (specifically,
honeycomb) lattice. Here, we propose that there exists the quantum spin Hall
effect (QSHE) in a buckled square lattice. Through performing global structure
optimization, we predict a new three-layer quasi-2D (Q2D) structure which has
the lowest energy among all structures with the thickness less than 6.0 {\AA}
for the BiF system. It is identified to be a Q2D TI with a large band gap (0.69
eV). The electronic states of the Q2D BiF system near the Fermi level are
mainly contributed by the middle Bi square lattice, which are sandwiched by two
inert BiF2 layers. This is beneficial since the interaction between a substrate
and the Q2D material may not change the topological properties of the system,
as we demonstrate in the case of the NaF substrate. Finally, we come up with a
new tight-binding model for a two-orbital system with the buckled square
lattice to explain the low-energy physics of the Q2D BiF material. Our study
not only predicts a QSH insulator for realistic room temperature applications,
but also provides a new lattice system for engineering topological states such
as quantum anomalous Hall effect.

$S_{\phi}=\Lambda^4\int{d^4x\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{F}}$, which should be resolved
through physical means. In the general relativity, the spherically symmetric
solution to the Einstein equation is a benchmark and its massive deformation
also play a crucial role in Lorentz breaking massive gravity. $\mathcal{F}$
will satisfy the constraint equation $T_0^1=0$ from the spherically symmetric
Einstein tensor $G_0^1=0$, if we maintain that any reasonable physical theory
should possess the spherically symmetric solutions. The St\""{u}ckelberg field
$\phi^i$ is taken as a 'hedgehog' configuration $\phi^i=\phi(r)x^i/r$, whose
stability is guaranteed by the topological one. Under this ans\""{a}tz,
$T_0^1=0$ is reduced to $d\mathcal{F}=0$. The functions $\mathcal{F}$ for
$d\mathcal{F}=0$ form a commutative ring $R^{\mathcal{F}}$. We obtain a general

$\mathcal{F}$ form a subring $S^{\mathcal{F}}\subset R^{\mathcal{F}}$. We show
that the metric is Schwarzschild, AdS or dS if $\mathcal{F}\in

analytical examples and their phenomenological applications. Furthermore, we
also discuss the stability of gravitational field by the analysis of Komar

ill-posedness results for NLS in certain $H^s$ spaces, which depend on the

operation of the D-Wave quantum computer. The decoherence time of a single flux
qubit is reported to be on the order of nanoseconds, which is much shorter than
the time required to carry out a computation on the timescale of seconds. In
our contribution we investigate a model of four qubits with one qubit coupled
to a phonon and (optionally) to environmental particles of high density of
states, called gravonons. The calculations indicate that when no gravonons are
present, the current in the qubit is flipped at some time and adiabatic
evolution is discontinued. The time dependent wave functional becomes a
non-correctable superposition of many excited states. The results demonstrate
the possibility of effectively suppressing the current flip and allowing for
continued adiabatic evolution when the entanglement to gravonons is included.
This adiabatic evolution is, however, a coherent evolution in high dimensional
spacetime and cannot be understood as a solution of Schr\""odinger's time
dependent equation in four dimensional spacetime. Compared to Schr\""odinger's
time development, the evolution is considerably slowed down, though still
adiabatic. The properties of our model reflect correctly the experimentally
found behaviour of the D-Wave machine and explain the factor of $10^8$
discrepancy between decoherence time and quantum computation time. The
observation and our explanation are in analogy to the $10^8$ discrepancy factor
found, when comparing experimental results on adsorbate quantum diffusion rate
with predictions of Schr\""odinger's time dependent equation, which can also be

behind an isotropic ion are assumed to be angle-independent. Using an
interferometric method involving XUV attosecond pulse trains and an IR probe
field in combination with a detection scheme, which allows for full 3D momentum
resolution, we show that measured time delays between electrons liberated from
the $1s^2$ spherically symmetric ground state of helium depend on the emission
direction of the electrons relative to the linear polarization axis of the
ionizing XUV light. Such time-delay anisotropy, for which we measure values as
large as 60 attoseconds, is caused by the interplay between final quantum
states with different symmetry and arises naturally whenever the
photoionization process involves the exchange of more than one photon in the
field of the parent-ion. With the support of accurate theoretical models, the
angular dependence of the time delay is attributed to small phase differences
that are induced in the laser-driven continuum transitions to the final states.
Since most measurement techniques tracing attosecond electron dynamics involve
the exchange of at least two photons, this is a general, significant, and
initially unexpected effect that must be taken into account in all such
photoionization measurements.

interferometric closure phases remained zero within errors during the

constrain the size of the outflows that we could have missed to ~2.5 mas along
the major axis, ~0.4 mas along the minor axis of the beam, corresponding to
approximately 232 and 35 Schwarzschild radii, respectively; we thus probe
spatial scales on which the jets of radio galaxies are suspected to convert
magnetic into kinetic energy. As probably less than 0.2 Jy of the flux from Sgr
A* can be attributed to accretion from G2, one finds an effective accretion
rate eta*Mdot < 1.5*10^9 kg/s ~ 7.7*10^-9 Mearth/yr for material from G2.
Exploiting the kinetic jet power--accretion power relation of radio galaxies,
one finds that the rate of accretion of matter that ends up in jets is limited
to Mdot < 10^17 kg/s ~ 0.5 Mearth/yr, less than about 20% of the mass of G2.

photoelectric, photoionization and H_2 dissociation heating as well as pumping
of molecular hydrogen by UV photons. All included radiative feedback processes
are extensively tested. We also compare our module to dedicated

the ability of HIV-1 to use hybrid spreading mechanisms and evaluate the

the model predicts that cell-to-cell spread becomes increasingly effective as

Deriving predictions of various treatments' influence on HIV-1 progression

the resource allocation process, in the case of scarce resources, and allocates
optimal rates for both high-traffic and low-traffic situations. Our distributed

prior work has applied compressive sensing (CS) techniques and the fact that
CSI can be sparsified. The adopted sparsifying bases fail, however, to reflect
the spatial correlation and channel conditions or to be feasible in practice.
In this paper, we propose a new sparsifying basis that reflects the long-term
characteristics of the channel, and needs no change as long as the spatial
correlation model does not change. We propose a new reconstruction algorithm

feed back compressed CSI in practice, we propose a new codebook for the

solar surface to determine the travel times of wave packets moving from one
surface location to another. We review the methodology to interpret travel-time
measurements in terms of small, localized perturbations to a horizontally
homogeneous reference solar model. Using the first Born approximation, we
derive and compute 3D travel-time sensitivity (Fr\'echet) kernels for
perturbations in sound-speed, density, pressure, and vector flows. While
kernels for sound speed and flows had been computed previously, here we extend
the calculation to kernels for density and pressure, hence providing a complete
description of the effects of solar dynamics and structure on travel times. We
treat three thermodynamic quantities as independent and do not assume
hydrostatic equilibrium. We present a convenient approach to computing damped
Green's functions using a normal-mode summation. The Green's function must be
computed on a wavenumber grid that has sufficient resolution to resolve the
longest lived modes. The typical kernel calculations used in this paper are
computer intensive and require on the order of 600 CPU hours per kernel.
Kernels are validated by computing the travel-time perturbation that results
from horizontally-invariant perturbations using two independent approaches. At
fixed sound-speed, the density and pressure kernels are approximately related
through a negative multiplicative factor, therefore implying that perturbations
in density and pressure are difficult to disentangle. Mean travel-times are not
only sensitive to sound-speed, density and pressure perturbations, but also to
flows, especially vertical flows. Accurate sensitivity kernels are needed to
interpret complex flow patterns such as convection.

(or to the ${\eta^\prime}$ in-medium mass shift) in the studied incident photon
energy regime. Therefore, such observables may be useful to help determine the
above ${\eta^\prime}$ in-medium renormalization from the comparison of the
results of our calculations with the data from the CBELSA/TAPS experiment. In
addition, we show that these distributions are also strongly influenced by the
momentum-dependent optical potential, which the outgoing participant proton
feels inside the carbon nucleus. This potential should be taken into account in
the analysis of these data with the aim to obtain information on the
${\eta^\prime}$ modification in cold nuclear matter.

  Part I","An updated version",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research on asymptotic model selection in the context of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) is almost non-existent in the literature. In
particular, when a collection of SDEs is considered, the problem of asymptotic
model selection has not been hitherto investigated. Indeed, even though the
diffusion coefficients may be considered known, questions on appropriate choice
of the drift functions constitute a non-trivial model selection problem. In
this article, we develop the asymptotic theory for comparisons between
collections of SDEs with respect to the choice of drift functions using Bayes
factors when the number of equations (individuals) in the collection of SDEs
tend to infinity while the time domains remain bounded for each equation. Our
asymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated with
the SDEs are independently and identically distributed (iid), as well as when
they are independently but not identically distributed (non-iid). In
particular, we allow incorporation of available time-dependent covariate
information into each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift
function; we also permit different initial values and domains of observations
for the SDEs. Our model selection problem thus encompasses selection of a set
of appropriate time-dependent covariates from a set of available time-dependent
covariates, besides selection of the part of the drift function free of
covariates. For both iid and non-iid set-ups we establish almost sure
exponential convergence of the Bayes factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate with
simulation studies that even in non-asymptotic scenarios Bayes factor
successfully captures the right set of covariates.

through the engineering of electronic structure. Here, we demonstrate an
alternative source for the Seebeck effect based on charge-carrier relaxation: A
charge mobility that changes rapidly with temperature can result in a sizeable
addition to the Seebeck coefficient. This new Seebeck source is demonstrated
explicitly for Ni-doped CoSb3, where a dramatic mobility change occurs due to
the crossover between two different charge-relaxation regimes. Our findings
unveil the origin of pronounced features in the Seebeck coefficient of many
other elusive materials characterized by a significant mobility mismatch. As
the physical origin for the latter can vary greatly, our proposal provides a
unifying framework for the understanding of a large panoply of thermoelectric

labels as additional features (a transformation of the input), we create
neural-network inspired novel methods that remove the emphasis of a prior

density function $\psi(t) \simeq t^{-1-\alpha}$) ($0\le \alpha \le 2$). An
ageing stochastic process is defined by the explicit dependence of its dynamic
quantities on the ageing time $t_a$, the time elapsed between its preparation
and the start of the observation. Subdiffusive ageing CTRWs describe systems
such as charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors, tracer dispersion in
geological and biological systems, or the dynamics of blinking quantum dots. We
derive the exact forms of the first passage time density for an ageing
subdiffusive CTRW in the semi-infinite, confined, and biased case, finding
different scaling regimes for weakly, intermediately, and strongly aged
systems: these regimes, with different scaling laws, are also found when the
scaling exponent is in the range $1<\alpha<2$, for sufficiently long $t_a$. We
compare our results with the ageing motion of a test particle in a quenched
energy landscape. We test our theoretical results in the quenched landscape
against simulations: only when the bias is strong enough, the correlations from
returning to previously visited sites become insignificant and the results
approach the aging CTRW results. With small or without bias, the ageing effects
disappear and a change in the exponent compared to the case of a completely
annealed landscape can be found, reflecting the build-up of correlations in the
quenched landscape.

either directly or via its eigenfunctions, the Jack polynomials. The
supersymmetric counterpart of this model, although much less ubiquitous, has an
equally rich structure. In particular, its eigenfunctions, the Jack
superpolynomials, appear to share the very same remarkable combinatorial and
structural properties as their non-supersymmetric version. These
super-functions are parametrized by superpartitions with fixed bosonic and
fermionic degrees. Now, a truly amazing feature pops out when the fermionic
degree is sufficiently large: the Jack superpolynomials stabilize and
factorize. Their stability is with respect to their expansion in terms of an
elementary basis where, in the stable sector, the expansion coefficients become
independent of the fermionic degree. Their factorization is seen when the
fermionic variables are stripped off in a suitable way which results in a
product of two ordinary Jack polynomials (somewhat modified by plethystic
transformations), dubbed the double Jack polynomials. Here, in addition to
spelling out these results, which were first obtained in the context of
Macdonal superpolynomials, we provide a heuristic derivation of the Jack
superpolynomial case by performing simple manipulations on the supersymmetric
eigen-operators, rendering them independent of the number of particles and of
the fermionic degree. In addition, we work out the expression of the
Hamiltonian which characterizes the double Jacks. This Hamiltonian, which
defines a new integrable system, involves not only the expected
Calogero-Sutherland pieces but also combinations of the generators of an
underlying affine ${\widehat{\mathfrak {sl}}_2}$ algebra.

activity of an unexplored filamentary dark cloud (~5.7pc x 1.9pc), which itself
is part of a large filament (~20pc) located in the S254-S258 OB complex at a
distance of 2.5kpc. Using MIPS Spitzer 24 micron data, we uncover 49 sources
with SNR greater than 5. We identified 45 sources as candidate YSOs of Class I,
Flat-spectrum & Class II nature. Additional 17 candidate YSOs (9 Class I & 8
Class II) are also identified using JHK and WISE photometry. We find that the
protostar to Class II sources ratio (~2) and the protostar fraction (~70%) of
the region are high. When the protostar fraction compared to other young
clusters, it suggests that the star formation in the dark cloud was possibly
started only 1 Myr ago. Combining the NIR photometry of the YSO candidates with
the theoretical evolutionary models, we infer that most of the candidate YSOs
formed in the dark cloud are low-mass (<2 Msolar) in nature. We examine the
spatial distribution of the YSOs and find that majority of them are linearly
aligned along the highest column density line (N(H2) ~1 x 10^22 cm^-2) of the
dark cloud along its long axis at mean nearest neighbor separation of ~0.2pc.
Using observed properties of the YSOs, physical conditions of the cloud and a
simple cylindrical model, we explore the possible star formation process of
this filamentary dark cloud and suggest that gravitational fragmentation within
the filament should have played a dominant role in the formation of the YSOs.
From the total mass of the YSOs, gaseous mass associated with the dark cloud,
and surrounding environment, we infer that the region is presently forming
stars at an efficiency ~3% and a rate ~30 Msolar Myr^-1, and may emerge to a
richer cluster.

  We analyse how many vertices the two colors paint eventually. We show that

Thereby, the variational approach resolves ambiguities related with the bath
discretization, which is generally necessary to make Anderson impurity models
tractable by exact diagonalization. The choice of variational degrees of
freedom made here allows systematic improvements of total energies over mean
field decouplings like Hartree-Fock. Furthermore, our approach allows us to
embed arbitrary bath discretization schemes in total energy calculations and to
systematically optimize and improve on traditional routes to the discretization
problem such as fitting of hybridization functions on Matsubara frequencies.
Benchmarks in terms of a single orbital Anderson model demonstrate that the
variational exact diagonalization method accurately reproduces free energies as
well as several single- and two-particle observables obtained from an exact
solution. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the variational exact
diagonalization approach to realistic five orbital problems with the example
system of Co impurities in bulk Cu and compare to continuous-time Monte Carlo

a function of resonator parameters as well as their periodicity. The
interaction between the two bandgaps is studied by varying the local resonance
frequency. We find that a single combined bandgap does not exist for this
system and that the Bragg bandgaps transition into sub-wavelength bandgaps when
the local resonance frequency is above their associated classical Bragg
frequency.

indicators (including the one provided by Hadoop) can be seriously harmed by
data skewness, load unbalancing, and straggling tasks. This is mainly due to
their implicit assumption that the running time depends linearly on the input
size. We thus design a novel profile-guided progress indicator, called
NearestFit, that operates without the linear hypothesis assumption and exploits
a careful combination of nearest neighbor regression and statistical curve
fitting techniques. Our theoretical progress model requires fine-grained
profile data, that can be very difficult to manage in practice. To overcome
this issue, we resort to computing accurate approximations for some of the
quantities used in our model through space- and time-efficient data streaming
algorithms. We implemented NearestFit on top of Hadoop 2.6.0. An extensive
empirical assessment over the Amazon EC2 platform on a variety of real-world
benchmarks shows that NearestFit is practical w.r.t. space and time overheads
and that its accuracy is generally very good, even in scenarios where
competitors incur non-negligible errors and wide prediction fluctuations.
Overall, NearestFit significantly improves the current state-of-art on progress
analysis for MapReduce.

the determination of certain ratios of $\bar{B}_s\to K^*$ form factors.
Moreover, a future precision measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in

unambiguously verify the left-handed nature of the transition operator as

cause screening effects in the quark-gluon plasma. Our analysis is based on the
identification and elimination of center vortices which allows to control the

reliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its
weight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with
its opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can
be extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse.
We illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral

the uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior. We take up the challenge

For the affine subclass, we get explicit results for the expected value and

are allowed to propagate in the bulk of five-dimensional brane world models
with compact extra dimension, and the Standard Model fields and their
interactions are supposed to be reproduced by the corresponding zero
Kaluza-Klein modes. An unexpected result is that in order to avoid possible
pathological behavior in the fermion sector, it is necessary to impose
constraints on the fermion field Lagrangian. In the case when the fermion zero
modes are supposed to be localized at one of the branes, these constraints
imply an additional relation between the vacuum profile of the Higgs field and
the form of the background metric. Moreover, this relation between the vacuum
profile of the Higgs field and the form of the background metric results in the
exact reproduction of the gauge boson and fermion sectors of the Standard Model
by the corresponding zero mode four-dimensional effective theory in all the
physically relevant cases, allowed by the absence of pathologies. Meanwhile,
deviations from these conditions can lead either back to pathological behavior
in the fermion sector or to a variance between the resulting zero mode
four-dimensional effective theory and the Standard Model, which, depending on
the model at hand, may, in principle, result in constraints putting the theory

Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) system, where multiple user equipments (UEs) aim at
uploading some data to a central server or to the Cloud. The traditional
uploading technique used in cellular systems, i.e., with separate links from
each UE to the eNodeB, is compared to innovative \textit{relay-based} schemes
that exploit Device-to-Device (D2D) communications between two (or more) UEs in
proximity to each other. Differences in the channel quality experienced by the
UEs offer an opportunity to develop D2D-based solutions, where \textit{(i)} the
UE with a poor direct link to the eNodeB will forward data to a nearby UE over
a high-quality D2D link; and \textit{(ii)} the receiving UE then uploads its
own generated data and the relayed data to the eNodeB over a good uplink
channel. A straightforward gain in the data uploading time can be obtained for
the first UE. To extend the benefits, also to the relaying UE, enhanced
D2D-based solutions are proposed that decrease the uploading time of this UE
based on the cooperative sharing of the resources allocated by the eNodeB to
the cooperating devices. Finally, preliminary results are also presented for a
multihop study case, where a chain of devices exploits D2D communications to
upload data to the eNodeB.

bound time-like geodesic motion in the exact static and axially symmetric
space-time of an (originally) Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a thin
disc or ring, is considered to test whether the often employed
""pseudo-Newtonian"" approach (resorting to Newtonian dynamics in gravitational
potentials modified to mimic the black-hole field) can reproduce phase-space
properties observed in the relativistic treatment. By plotting Poincar\'e
surfaces of section and using two recurrence methods for similar situations as
in the relativistic case, we find similar tendencies in the evolution of the
phase portrait with parameters (mainly with mass of the disc/ring and with
energy of the orbiters), namely those characteristic to weakly non-integrable
systems. More specifically, this is true for the Paczy\'nski--Wiita and a newly
suggested logarithmic potential, whereas the Nowak--Wagoner potential leads to
a different picture. The potentials and the exact relativistic system clearly
differ in delimitation of the phase-space domain accessible to a given set of
particles, though this mainly affects the chaotic sea whereas not so much the
occurrence and succession of discrete dynamical features (resonances). In the
pseudo-Newtonian systems, the particular dynamical features generally occur for
slightly smaller values of the perturbation parameters than in the relativistic
system, so one may say that the pseudo-Newtonian systems are slightly more
prone to instability. We also add remarks on numerics (a different code is used
than in previous papers), on the resemblance of dependence of the dynamics on
perturbing mass and on orbital energy, on the difference between the Newtonian
and relativistic Bach--Weyl rings, and on the relation between Poincar\'e
sections and orbital shapes within the meridional plane.

of 800ks in the three central ACIS-I fields, a region of approximately
$0.29$~deg$^{2}$. This is currently the third deepest X-ray survey in
existence, a factor $\sim 2-3$ shallower than the Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs)
but over an area $\sim 3$ times greater than each CDF. We present a catalogue
of 937 point sources detected in the deep \chandra\ observations. We present
identifications of our X-ray sources from deep ground-based, Spitzer, GALEX and
HST imaging. Using a likelihood ratio analysis, we associate multi band
counterparts for 929/937 of our X-ray sources, with an estimated 95~\%
reliability, making the identification completeness approximately 94~\% in a
statistical sense. Reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 353 of our X-ray
sources are provided predominantly from Keck (DEEP2/3) and MMT Hectospec, so
the current spectroscopic completeness is $\sim 38$~per cent. For the remainder
of the X-ray sources, we compute photometric redshifts based on multi-band
photometry in up to 35 bands from the UV to mid-IR. Particular attention is
given to the fact that the vast majority the X-ray sources are AGN and require
hybrid templates. Our photometric redshifts have mean accuracy of $\sigma=0.04$
and an outlier fraction of approximately 5\%, reaching $\sigma=0.03$ with less
than 4\% outliers in the area covered by CANDELS . The X-ray, multi-wavelength
photometry and redshift catalogues are made publicly available.

generalized into a general machine learning system as categorization axioms
become trivial when the number of categories becomes one. In order to
generalize categorization axioms into general cases, categorization input and
categorization output are reinterpreted by inner and outer category
representation. According to the categorization reinterpretation, two category
representation axioms are presented. Category representation axioms and
categorization axioms can be combined into a generalized categorization
axiomatic framework, which accurately delimit the theoretical categorization
constraints and overcome the shortcoming of categorization axioms. The proposed
axiomatic framework not only discuses categorization test issue but also
reinterprets many results in machine learning in a unified way, such as

renormalisation scale mu, where p is the momentum in the legs. Indeed, unlike
the vector case, the Ward-Takahashi (WT) identity for the axial current is
shown to imply both the renormalisation scale independence of ZA and a mu2
dependence of ZA,MOM. This mu^2 dependence is simply related to certain
invariants in the pseudoscalar vertex and can persist in the chiral limit due
to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry (pion pole). It is seen clearly
in the mu^2 dependence of some lattice calculations of ZA,MOM/ZV,MOM near the
chiral limit.

  oscillations in g-mode period spacings from stellar models","Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/805/2/127",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With recent advances in asteroseismology it is now possible to peer into the
cores of red giants, potentially providing a way to study processes such as
nuclear burning and mixing through their imprint as sharp structural variations
-- glitches -- in the stellar cores. Here we show how such core glitches can
affect the oscillations we observe in red giants. We derive an analytical
expression describing the expected frequency pattern in the presence of a
glitch. This formulation also accounts for the coupling between acoustic and
gravity waves. From an extensive set of canonical stellar models we find
glitch-induced variation in the period spacing and inertia of non-radial modes
during several phases of red-giant evolution. Significant changes are seen in
the appearance of mode amplitude and frequency patterns in asteroseismic
diagrams such as the power spectrum and the \'echelle diagram. Interestingly,
along the red-giant branch glitch-induced variation occurs only at the
luminosity bump, potentially providing a direct seismic indicator of stars in
that particular evolution stage. Similarly, we find the variation at only
certain post-helium-ignition evolution stages, namely, in the early phases of
helium-core burning and at the beginning of helium-shell burning signifying the
asymptotic-giant-branch bump. Based on our results, we note that assuming stars
to be glitch-free, while they are not, can result in an incorrect estimate of
the period spacing. We further note that including diffusion and mixing beyond
classical Schwarzschild, could affect the characteristics of the glitches,
potentially providing a way to study these physical processes.

evaluating it on all points in $\{0,1\}^m$. We denote this code by $RM(m,r)$.
The minimal distance of $RM(m,r)$ is $2^{m-r}$ and so it cannot correct more
than half that number of errors in the worst case. For random errors one may
hope for a better result.
  In this work we give an efficient algorithm (in the block length $n=2^m$) for
decoding random errors in Reed-Muller codes far beyond the minimal distance.
Specifically, for low rate codes (of degree $r=o(\sqrt{m})$) we can correct a
random set of $(1/2-o(1))n$ errors with high probability. For high rate codes
(of degree $m-r$ for $r=o(\sqrt{m/\log m})$), we can correct roughly $m^{r/2}$
errors.
  More generally, for any integer $r$, our algorithm can correct any error
pattern in $RM(m,m-(2r+2))$ for which the same erasure pattern can be corrected
in $RM(m,m-(r+1))$. The results above are obtained by applying recent results
of Abbe, Shpilka and Wigderson (STOC, 2015), Kumar and Pfister (2015) and
Kudekar et al. (2015) regarding the ability of Reed-Muller codes to correct
random erasures.
  The algorithm is based on solving a carefully defined set of linear equations
and thus it is significantly different than other algorithms for decoding
Reed-Muller codes that are based on the recursive structure of the code. It can
be seen as a more explicit proof of a result of Abbe et al. that shows a
reduction from correcting erasures to correcting errors, and it also bares some
similarities with the famous Berlekamp-Welch algorithm for decoding
Reed-Solomon codes.

based frameworks can be implemented for targeting, the latter is often more
relevant than the former from a managerial point of view due to easy
attainability of the targets. To date, the two projection-dependent problems of
reference set identification and returns to scale (RTS) measurement have been
extensively discussed in DEA literature. To the best of our knowledge,
nonetheless, there exists only one study which uses a closest projection for
identifying reference set and accomplishes this task through a primal-dual
linear programming based method. Motivated by this, we investigate the two
aforementioned problems in a least distance based framework. First, we propose
a lexicographic multiple-objective programming problem to find a unique closest
projection for an inefficient decision making unit (DMU). Associated with the
founded projection, we then identify all the possible closest reference DMUs by
developing a linear programming model in the envelopment form. For an
inefficient DMU, we next define closest RTS (CRTS) as the RTS of its least
distance projection and measure the CRTS in two stages. Finally, we illustrate
our proposed approach by a numerical example and compare the results with those
found in the most distance based framework.

tensors of elastodynamics by the requirements that the linear elastodynamic
system under consideration be both causal (effects succeed causes) and passive
(system doesn't produce energy)? Compared to electromagnetism, elastodynamics
is complicated by its generally non diagonalizable constitutive tensors. In
this paper we clarify the constraints that causality and passivity place on
very general forms of elastodynamic constitutive relations. Specifically we
show that the satisfaction of passivity (and causality) directly requires that
the hermitian parts, as defined later, of the Fourier transforms of the time
derivatives of the elastodynamic constitutive tensors be positive semi-definite
at all frequencies. Additionally, we show that the conditions subsequently
require that the non-hermitian parts of the Fourier transforms of the
constitutive tensors, when divided by the imaginary number $i$, be positive
semi-definite for positive values of frequency and negative semi-definite for
negative values of frequency. We show that when major symmetries are assumed
these definiteness relations apply simply to the real and imaginary parts of
the relevant tensors. For diagonal and one-dimensional problems, these positive
semi-definiteness relationships reduce to simple inequality relations. Finally
we extend the results to highly general constitutive relations which include
the Willis inhomogeneous relations as a special case.

indications for a stratification of the abundances of these elements and
significant anisotropies. We then perform a spatially resolved spectral
analysis by identifying five different regions characterized by high/low values
of the Fe K equivalent width. We find that the spatial distribution of the Fe K
emission is correlated with that of the Cr XXII. We also detect the Ti K-line
complex in the spectra extracted from the two regions with the highest values
of the Fe and Cr equivalent widths. The Ti line emissions remains undetected in
regions where the Fe and Cr equivalent widths are low. Our results indicate
that the post-shock Ti is spatially co-located with other iron-peak nuclei in

  Part II","An updated version",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of model selection in the context of a system of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) has not been touched upon in the literature.
Indeed, properties of Bayes factors have not been studied even in single SDE
based model comparison problems. In this article, we first develop an
asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when two SDEs are compared, assuming the
time domain expands. Using this we then develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes
factors when systems of SDEs are compared, assuming that the number of
equations in each system, as well as the time domain, increase indefinitely.
Our asymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated
with the SDEs are independently and identically distributed (iid), as well as
when they are independently but not identically distributed (non-iid). Quite
importantly, we allow inclusion of available time-dependent covariate
information into each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift function
in a random effects set-up; different initial values for the SDEs are also
permitted. Thus, our general model-selection framework includes simultaneously
the variable selection problem associated with time-varying covariates, as well
as choice of the part of the drift function free of covariates. As we show, the
Bayes factor is inconsistent for comparing individual SDEs, in the sense that
the log-Bayes factor converges only in expectation, while the relevant variance
does not converge to zero. Nevertheless, it has been possible to exploit this
result to establish almost sure exponential convergence of the Bayes factor
when, in addition, the number of individuals are also allowed to increase
indefinitely. We carry out simulated and real data analyses to demonstrate that
Bayes factor is a suitable candidate for covariate selection in our SDE models
even in non-asymptotic situations.

which clearly indicate validity of the model.

approach to identify and measure cohort effects in mortality data set. The
approach is based on differential geometry and leads to an explicit result
which can describe how strong the cohort effect is in any period. This
quantitative measurement provides a possibility to compare cohort effects among
different countries or groups. The paper also suggests to use coefficient of
variation as a measurement of the whole cohort effect for one country. Data of
several countries are taken as examples to explain our approach and results.

from genetic information contained within mRNAs. Here we study the kinetics of
translation at molecular level through a stochastic simulation model. The model
explicitly include RNA sequences, ribosome dynamics, tRNA pool and biochemical
reactions in the translation elongation. The results show that the translation
efficiency is mainly limited by the available ribosome number, translation
initiation and the translation elongation time. The elongation time is
log-normal distribution with mean and variance determined by both the codon
saturation and the process of aa-tRNA selection at each codon binding.
Moreover, our simulations show that the translation accuracy exponentially
decreases with the sequence length. These results suggest that aa-tRNA
competition is crucial for both translation elongation, translation efficiency
and the accuracy, which in turn determined the effective protein production
rate of correct proteins. Our results improve the dynamical equation of protein
production with a delay differential equation which is dependent on sequence
informations through both the effective production rate and the distribution of
elongation time.

  MPa",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new equation of state for argon has been developed in view to extend the
range of validity of the equation of state previously proposed by Tegeler et
al. (1999) and to obtain a better physical description of the experimental
thermodynamic data for the whole fluid region (single-phase and coexistence
states). As proposed by Tegeler et al., this equation is also based on a
functional form of the residual part of the reduced Helmholtz free energy.
However in this work, the fundamental equation for the Helmholtz free energy
has been derived from the measured quantities CV(rho,T) and P(rho,T). The
empirical description of the isochoric heat capacity CV is based on an original
empirical description containing explicitly the metastable states. The new
formulation is valid for the whole fluid region from the melting line to 2300 K
and for pressures up to 50 000 MPa. It also predicts existence of a maximum of
the isochoric heat capacity CV along isochors as experimentally observed in
several other fluids.

counterintuitive consequences of quantum theory. Nevertheless, many discussions
about the Klein paradox are based upon single-particle Dirac equation in
quantum mechanics rather than quantum field method. By using the path integral
formalism, we evaluate the reflection and transmission coefficients up to the
lowest order for the electron scattering by the finite square barrier
potential. Within the context of assuming the step potential is the limiting
case of the finite square barrier potential, we explain the Klein paradox that
is caused by the ill-definition of the step potential.

the open curve in only finitely many points. This was proved only for finitely

problem to the case of influence of Yarkovsky effect, which is known as reason
of additional infinitesimal acceleration of a small bodies in the space (due to
anisotropic re-emission of absorbed energy from the sun, other stellar
sources). Asteroid is supposed to move under the influence of gravitational
forces from 2 massive bodies (which are rotating around their common centre of
masses on Kepler trajectories), as well under the influence of pressure of
light from both the primaries. Analyzing the ODE system of motion, we explore
the existense of equilibrium points for a small body (asteroid) in the case
when the 2-nd primary is non-oblate spheroid. In such a case, it is proved the
existence of maximally 256 different non-planar libration points in generalized
