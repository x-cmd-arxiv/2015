differences in the transitions of Markov chains are reflected in differences
between their distributions. We prove powerful and flexible bounds on the
distance of the $n$th step distributions of two Markov chains when one of them
satisfies a Wasserstein ergodicity condition. Our work is motivated by the
recent interest in approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the
analysis of big data sets. By using an approach based on Lyapunov functions, we
provide estimates for geometrically ergodic Markov chains under weak
assumptions. In an autoregressive model, our bounds cannot be improved in
general. We illustrate our theory by showing quantitative estimates for
approximate versions of two prominent MCMC algorithms, the Metropolis-Hastings
and stochastic Langevin algorithms.

Partial correlation patterns exhibit approximately a third-order Markov

the variance of non-linearity due to the signal Gaussianity approximation,
leading to maximum reach predictions for typical optical systems which may be
pessimistic by about 5% to 15%, depending on fiber type and system set-up.
Various models have been proposed which improve over the GN model accuracy. One
of them is the EGN model, which completely removes the Gaussianity
approximation from all non-linear interference (NLI) components. The EGN model
is, however, substantially more complex than the GN model. Recently, we
proposed a simple closed-form formula which permits to approximate the EGN
model, starting from the GN. It was however limited to all-identical,
equispaced channels, and did not correct single-channel NLI (also called SCI).
In this follow-up contribution, we propose an improved version which both
allows to address non-identical channels and corrects the SCI contribution as
well. Extensive simulative testing shows the new formula to be asymptotically
very accurate, for sufficiently large number of spans. This is a preliminary
document which will be followed by a journal submission.

(radiative natural SUSY or RNS) which include a DFSZ-like solution to the
strong CP and SUSY mu problems, dark matter is expected to be an admixture of
both axions and higgsino-like WIMPs. The WIMP/axion abundance calculation
requires simultaneous solution of a set of coupled Boltzmann equations which
describe quasi-stable axinos and saxions. In most of parameter space, axions
make up the dominant contribution of dark matter although regions of WIMP
dominance also occur. We show the allowed range of PQ scale f_a and compare to
the values expected to be probed by the ADMX axion detector in the near future.
We also show WIMP detection rates which are suppressed from usual expectations
because now WIMPs comprise only a fraction of the total dark matter.
Nonetheless, ton-scale noble liquid detectors should be able to probe the
entirety of RNS parameter space. Indirect WIMP detection rates are less
propitious since they are reduced by the square of the depleted WIMP abundance.

side-bubbles, created by trapping air pockets in blind channels perpendicular
to the main channel direction. This configuration consists of acoustically
excited bubbles with a semi-cylindrical shape that generate significant
streaming flow. Due to the geometry of the channels, such flows have been
generally considered as quasi two-dimensional. Similar assumptions are often
made in many other microfluidic systems based on \emph{flat} micro-channels.
However, in this paper we show that microparticle trajectories actually present
a much richer behavior, with particularly strong out-of-plane dynamics in
regions close to the microbubble interface. Using Astigmatism Particle Tracking
Velocimetry, we reveal that the apparent planar streamlines are actually
projections of a \emph{streamsurface} with a pseudo-toroidal shape. We
therefore show that acoustic streaming cannot generally be assumed as a

s$^{-1}$, the proton $\beta = 0.08$ and the magnetic field strength is 8 nT.
These shocks are fast with a median speed of 590 km s$^{-1}$ but weak with a
median Alfv{\'e}nic Mach number of 1.9. They typically compress the magnetic
field and density by a factor of 2-3. The most extreme upstream conditions
found were a fast magnetosonic speed of 230 km s$^{-1}$, a plasma $\beta$ of
0.02, upstream solar wind speed of 740 km s$^{-1}$ and density of 0.5
cm$^{-3}$. Nineteen of these complex events were associated with an intense
geomagnetic storm (peak Dst under $-100$ nT) within 12 hours of the shock
detection at Wind, and fifteen were associated with a drop of the storm-time
Dst index of more than 50 nT between 3 and 9 hours after shock detection. We
also compare them to a sample of 45 shocks propagating in more typical upstream
conditions. We show the average property of these shocks through a superposed
epoch analysis, and we present some analytical considerations regarding the
compression ratios of shocks in low $\beta$ regimes. As most of these shocks
are measured in the back half of a CME, we conclude that about half the shocks
may not remain fast-mode shocks as they propagate through an entire CME due to
the large upstream and magnetosonic speeds.

detection in videos using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for
image classification. We study different ways of performing spatial and
temporal pooling, feature normalization, choice of CNN layers as well as choice
of classifiers. Making judicious choices along these dimensions led to a very
significant increase in performance over more naive approaches that have been
used till now. We evaluate our approach on the challenging TRECVID MED'14
dataset with two popular CNN architectures pretrained on ImageNet. On this
MED'14 dataset, our methods, based entirely on image-trained CNN features, can
outperform several state-of-the-art non-CNN models. Our proposed late fusion of
CNN- and motion-based features can further increase the mean average precision
(mAP) on MED'14 from 34.95% to 38.74%. The fusion approach achieves the
state-of-the-art classification performance on the challenging UCF-101 dataset.

the form of their potentials, and the coupling between the fields and the

that the summation of diagrams resulting from the self-consistent solution of
the Dyson equation removes the divergences pathological to second-order
Moller-Plesset theory (MP2) for strong correlations. In the language often used
in density functional theory contexts, this means GF2 has a greatly reduced
fractional spin error relative to MP2. The natural question then is what
effect, if any, does the Dyson summation have on the fractional charge error in
GF2? To this end we generalize our previous implementation of GF2 to open-shell
systems and analyze its fractional spin and charge errors. We find that like
MP2, GF2 possesses only a very small fractional charge error, and consequently
little many electron self-interaction error. This shows that GF2 improves on
the critical failings of MP2, but without altering the positive features that
make it desirable. Furthermore, we find that GF2 has both less fractional
charge and fractional spin errors than typical hybrid density functionals as

RW Aur A is a classical T Tauri star (CTTS) with an unusually rich
emission line spectrum. In 2014 the star faded by ~ 3 magnitudes in the V band
and went into a long-lasting minimum. In 2010 the star suffered from a similar
fading, although less deep. These events in RW Aur A are very unusual among the
CTTS, and have been attributed to occultations by passing dust clouds. Aims. We
want to find out if any spectral changes took place after the last fading of RW
Aur A with the intention to gather more information on the occulting body and
the cause of the phenomenon. Methods. We collected spectra of the two
components of RW Aur. Photometry was made before and during the minimum.
Results. The overall spectral signatures reflecting emission from accretion
flows from disk to star did not change after the fading. However, blue-shifted
absorption components related to the stellar wind had increased in strength in
certain resonance lines, and the profiles and strengths, but not fluxes, of
forbidden lines had become drastically different. Conclusions. The extinction
through the obscuring cloud is grey indicating the presence of large dust
grains. At the same time, there are no traces of related absorbing gas. The
cloud occults the star and the interior part of the stellar wind, but not the
wind/jet further out. The dimming in 2014 was not accompanied by changes in the
accretion flows at the stellar surface. There is evidence that the structure
and velocity pattern of the stellar wind did change significantly. The dimmings
could be related to passing condensations in a tidally disrupted disk, as
proposed earlier, but we also speculate that large dust grains have been
stirred up from the inclined disk into the line-of-sight through the
interaction with an enhanced wind.

density is stipulated by the corresponding growth of the magnetic helicity
density due to the presence of the anomalous electric current in the Maxwell

chiral magnetic effect driven by the difference of chemical potentials for the
right and left handed massless electrons and (ii) constant chiral electroweak
electron-nucleon interaction term, which has the polarization origin and
depends on the constant neutron density in a neutron star core. The remarkable
issue for the decisive role of the magnetic helicity evolution in the suggested
mechanism is the arbitrariness of an initial magnetic helicity including the
case of non-helical fields from the beginning. The tendency of the magnetic
helicity density to the maximal helicity case at large evolution times provides
the growth of a seed magnetic field to the strongest magnetic fields in
astrophysics.

When they were first discovered in 2005, dynamical ejection from the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Centre (GC) was suggested as
their origin. The two dozen HVSs known today are young massive B stars, mostly
of 3-4 solar masses. Recently, 20 HVS candidates of low mass were discovered in
the Segue G and K dwarf sample, but none of them originates from the GC. We
embarked on a kinematic analysis of the Segue HVS candidate sample using the
full 6D phase space information based on new proper motion measurements. Their
orbital properties can then be derived by tracing back their trajectories in
different mass models of our Galaxy. We present the results for 14 candidate
HVSs, for which proper motion measurements were possible. Significantly lower
proper motions than found in the previous study were derived. Considering three
different Galactic mass models we find that all stars are bound to the Galaxy.
We confirm that the stars do not originate from the GC. The distribution of
their proper motions and radial velocities is consistent with predictions for
runaway stars ejected from the Galactic disk by the binary supernova mechanism.
However, their kinematics are also consistent with old disk membership.
Moreover, most stars have rather low metallicities and strong $\alpha$-element
enrichment as typical for thick disk and halo stars, whereas the metallicity of
the three most metal-rich stars could possibly indicate that they are runaway
stars from the thin disk. One star shows halo kinematics.

electronic properties of phosphorene using density functional theory. The
surface adatoms considered are B, C, N, O and F with a [He] core electronic
configuration. Our calculations show that B and C, with electronegativity close
to P, prefer to break the sp3 bonds of phosphorene, and reside at the
interstitial sites in the 2D lattice by forming sp2 bonds with the native
atoms. On the other hand, N, O and F, which are more electronegative than P,
prefer the surface sites by attracting the lone pairs of phosphorene. B, N and
F adsorption will also introduce local magnetic moment to the lattice.
Moreover, B, C, N and F adatoms will modify the band gap of phosphorene
yielding metallic transverse tunneling characters. Oxygen does not modify the
band gap of phosphorene, and a diode like tunneling behavior is observed. Our
results therefore offer a possible route to tailor the electronic and magnetic
properties of phosphorene by the adatom functionalization, and provide the
physical insights of the environmental sensitivity of phosphorene, which will
be helpful to experimentalists in evaluating the performance and aging effects

for decades. But, Selinger-style algorithms are asymptotically suboptimal for

that many have advocated supplementing relational engines with specialized

replace it during shock breakout (SB). We demonstrate here that for some
realistic progenitors enshrouded in optically thick winds, such as possibly SN
2008D, a CS forms deep inside the wind, soon after the RDS leaves the core, and
therefore significantly before SB. The RDS does not survive the transition from
the core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently
dense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock
curvature. This typically happens when the shock velocity is $\lesssim 0.1 {\rm
c} \, (\frac{u_{\rm w}}{10\,{\rm km/s}}) (\frac{\dot{M}}{5 \cdot 10^{-4} \,
{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}})^{-1} (\frac{r_\ast}{10^{13}\,{\rm cm}})$, where
$u_{\rm w}$, $\dot{M}$ and $r_\ast$ are respectively the wind velocity,
mass-loss rate and radius of the progenitor star. The radiative CS results in a
hard spectrum of the photon flash at breakout, which would produce an X-ray
flash. Cosmic ray acceleration would start before SB, for such progenitors. A
fraction of secondary TeV neutrinos can reach the observer up to more than ten
hours before the first photons from breakout, providing information on the

many experimentally relevant crossover phenomena that can be described in terms
of fixed points, originally discussed by Hertz, that ultimately become unstable

interacting with their neighbors and in particular, the modified model allows
the update of self-confidence levels to take place in finite time without
waiting for the opinion process to reach a consensus on any particular issue.
We study properties of this Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model and compare the
associated equilibria and stability with those of the original DeGroot-Friedkin

continuing success that defectors be policed. The precise connection between
punishers and benefits, population structure, and division of labour, however,
remains ill-understood. Many models assume costly ""peer punishment"" to enforce
cooperation, but results in the economics literature suggest that this
assumption may not be generally valid. In many human and animal societies,
there is a division of labour between a purely supportive majority and a
dedicated minority of police-like enforcers. Here we present several extensions
to the Public Goods Game with punishment which allow for this possibility, and
evaluate their influence on the level of cooperative behaviour. We find that a
structure of separate subpopulations, which only interact through migration of
individuals, can have a strong effect on the evolutionary dynamics of a system
and significantly facilitate cooperation. Forcing defectors to contribute and
enabling fitness transfers to punishers both have a weak positive effect on
cooperation levels. In the presence of group competition, however, evolutionary
effects can paradoxically hinder cooperation.

fly away from minima in an unbounded space. The problem of a particle near

signaled by the sign change of the Lyapunov exponent that characterizes the
mean rate of particle approach to the minimum (which could be wall or another
particle). Here we solve analytically this problem for inelastic collisions and
derive the phase diagram for the transition in the inertia-inelasticity plane.
An important feature of the phase diagram is the region of inelastic collapse:
if the restitution coefficient of particle velocity is smaller than some
critical value, then the particle is localized for any inertia. We present

spectra (R 26,000) obtained with VLT/FLAMES. Our results provide evidence for a
new type of star cluster, based on the CSS dynamical mass scaling relations.
All radial velocity (v_r) and line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los)
measurements are performed with the penalized pixel fitting (ppxf) technique,
which provided sigma_ppxf estimates for 115 targets. The sigma_ppxf estimates
are corrected to the 2D projected half-light radii, sigma_{1/2}, as well as the
cluster cores, sigma_0, accounting for observational/aperture effects and are
combined with structural parameters, from high spatial resolution imaging, in
order to derive total dynamical masses (M_dyn) for 112 members of NGC5128's
star cluster system. In total, 89 CSSs have dynamical masses measured for the
first time along with the corresponding dynamical mass-to-light ratios
(Upsilon_V^dyn). We find two distinct sequences in the Upsilon_V^dyn - M_dyn
plane, which are well approximated by power laws of the forms Upsilon_V^dyn
M_dyn^0.33+\-0.04 and Upsilon_V^dyn - M_dyn^0.79+\-0.04. The shallower sequence
corresponds to the very bright tail of the globular cluster luminosity function
(GCLF), while the steeper relation appears to be populated by a distinct group
of objects which require significant dark gravitating components such as
central massive black holes and/or exotically concentrated dark matter
distributions. This result would suggest that the formation and evolution of
these CSSs are markedly different from the ""classical"" globular clusters in
NGC5128 and the Local Group, despite the fact that these clusters have

over two decades in projected distance at $z\approx0.2$. The study is based on
a sample of $95$ galaxies from a highly complete ($ > 80\%$) survey of faint
galaxies ($L > 0.1L_*$) with archival quasar absorption spectra and $53$
galaxies from the literature. A clear anti-correlation is found between HI
(OVI) column density and virial radius normalized projected distance, $d/R_{\rm
h}$. Strong HI (OVI) absorption systems with column densities greater than
$10^{14.0}$ ($10^{13.5}$) cm$^{-2}$ are found for $48$ of $54$ ($36$ of $42$)
galaxies at $d < \,R_{\rm h}$ indicating a mean covering fraction of
$\langle\kappa_{\rm HI}\rangle=0.89$ ($\langle\kappa_{\rm OVI}\rangle=0.86$).
OVI absorbers are found at $d\approx R_{\rm h}$, beyond the extent observed for
lower ionization species. At $d/R_{\rm h}=1-3$ strong HI (OVI) absorption
systems are found for only $7$ of $43$ ($5$ of $34$) galaxies
($\langle\kappa_{\rm HI}\rangle=0.16$ and $\langle\kappa_{\rm
OVI}\rangle=0.15$). Beyond $d=3\,R_{\rm h}$, the HI and OVI covering fractions
decrease to levels consistent with coincidental systems. The high completeness
of the galaxy survey enables an investigation of environmental dependence of
extended gas properties. Galaxies with nearby neighbors exhibit a modest
increase in OVI covering fraction at $d>R_{\rm h}$ compared to isolated
galaxies ($\kappa_{\rm OVI}\approx0.13$ versus $0.04$) but no excess HI
absorption. These findings suggest that environmental effects play a role in
distributing heavy elements beyond the enriched gaseous halos of individual
galaxies. Finally, we find that differential HI and OVI absorption between
early- and late-type galaxies continues from $d < R_{\rm h}$ to
$d\approx3\,R_{\rm h}$.

to study new models. In general, SARAH can handle a wide range of models beyond
the MSSM coming with additional chiral superfields, extra gauge groups, or
distinctive features like Dirac gaugino masses. All of these models can be
implemented in a compact form in SARAH and are easy to use: SARAH extracts all
analytical properties of the given model like two-loop renormalization group
equations, tadpole equations, mass matrices and vertices. Also one- and
two-loop corrections to tadpoles and self-energies can be obtained. For
numerical calculations SARAH can be interfaced to other tools to get the mass
spectrum, to check flavour or dark matter constraints, and to test the vacuum
stability, or to perform collider studies. In particular, the interface to
SPheno allows a precise prediction of the Higgs mass in a given model
comparable to MSSM precision by incorporating the important two-loop
corrections. I show in great detail at the example of the B-L-SSM how SARAH
together with SPheno, HiggsBounds/HiggsSignals, FlavorKit, Vevacious, CalcHep,
MicrOmegas, WHIZARD, and MadGraph can be used to study all phenomenological

of an $SU(N_D)$ strongly-coupled theory with even $N_D \geq 4$. All mass scales
are technically natural, and dark matter stability is automatic without
imposing an additional discrete or global symmetry. Constituent fermions
transform in vector-like representations of the electroweak group that permit
both electroweak-breaking and electroweak-preserving mass terms. This gives a
tunable coupling of stealth dark matter to the Higgs boson independent of the
dark matter mass itself. We specialize to $SU(4)$, and investigate the
constraints on the model from dark meson decay, electroweak precision
measurements, basic collider limits, and spin-independent direct detection
scattering through Higgs exchange. We exploit our earlier lattice simulations
that determined the composite spectrum as well as the effective Higgs coupling
of stealth dark matter in order to place bounds from direct detection,
excluding constituent fermions with dominantly electroweak-breaking masses. A
lower bound on the dark baryon mass $m_B \gtrsim 300$ GeV is obtained from the
indirect requirement that the lightest dark meson not be observable at LEP II.
We briefly survey some intriguing properties of stealth dark matter that are
worthy of future study, including: collider studies of dark meson production
and decay; indirect detection signals from annihilation; relic abundance
estimates for both symmetric and asymmetric mechanisms; and direct detection
through electromagnetic polarizability, a detailed study of which will appear

Matter (DM) interactions. For several types of DM-Standard Model couplings, a
meaningful interpretation of the results requires to go beyond effective field
theory, considering simplified models with light mediators. This is especially
important in the case of loop-mediated interactions. In this paper we perform
the first simplified model study of the magnetic dipole interacting DM, by
including the one-loop momentum-dependent form factors that mediate the
coupling -- given by the Dark Penguin -- in collider processes. We compute
bounds from the monojet, monophoton, and diphoton searches at the $8$ and $14$
TeV LHC, and compare the results to those of direct and indirect detection
experiments. Future searches at the $100$ TeV hadron collider and at the ILC
are also addressed. We find that the optimal search strategy requires loose
cuts on the missing transverse energy, to capture the enhancement of the form
factors near the threshold for on-shell production of the mediators. We
consider both minimal models and models where an additional state beyond the DM
is accessible. In the latter case, under the assumption of anarchic flavor
structure in the dark sector, the LHC monophoton and diphoton searches will be
able to set much stronger bounds than in the minimal scenario. A determination
of the mass of the heavier dark fermion might be feasible using the $M_{T2}$
variable. In addition, if the Dark Penguin flavor structure is almost aligned
with that of the DM mass, a displaced signal from the decay of the heavier dark
fermion into the DM and photon can be observed. This allows us to set
constraints on the mixings and couplings of the model from an existing search
for non-pointing photons.

a dark SU(4) confining gauge theory. In the nonrelativistic limit,
electromagnetic polarizability proceeds through a dimension-7 interaction
leading to a very small scattering cross section for dark matter with weak
scale masses. This represents a lower bound on the scattering cross section for
composite dark matter theories with electromagnetically charged constituents.
We carry out lattice calculations of the polarizability for the lightest
baryons in SU(3) and SU(4) gauge theories using the background field method on
quenched configurations. We find the polarizabilities of SU(3) and SU(4) to be
comparable (within about 50%) normalized to the baryon mass, which is
suggestive for extensions to larger SU(N) groups. The resulting scattering
cross sections with a xenon target are shown to be potentially detectable in
the dark matter mass range of about 200-700 GeV, where the lower bound is from
the existing LUX constraint while the upper bound is the coherent neutrino
background. Significant uncertainties in the cross section remain due to the
more complicated interaction of the polarizablity operator with nuclear
structure, however the steep dependence on the dark matter mass, $1/m_B^6$,
suggests the observable dark matter mass range is not appreciably modified. We
briefly highlight collider searches for the mesons in the theory as well as the
indirect astrophysical effects that may also provide excellent probes of
stealth dark matter.

short path from a start to a target article by only clicking links encountered

candidates for missing links and then rank these candidates. Experiments show

configurations where energetic radiation (E~ P_{J_T}) is only along either the
single jet direction or the beam direction with only soft radiation (E ~ \tau_1
<<P_{J_T}) in between. Thus, the restriction tau_1 << P_{J_T} corresponds to a
veto on additional jets and leads to large Sudakov logarithms of \tau_1/P_{J_T}
that must be resummed. Based on a factorization framework, derived using the
Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), we provide resummation results at the
NNLL level of accuracy and match them onto the NLO result in fixed order
perturbation theory, appropriate in the \tau_1 \sim P_{J_T} region where
additional jets and hard radiation are allowed. The \tau_1-distribution depends
on the jet algorithm used to find the leading jet in the region tau_1 ~
P_{J_T}, unlike the resummation region where this dependence is power
suppressed in tau_1/P_{J_T} << 1. We give results for the entire tau_1
spectrum, with a smooth matching between the resummation region and fixed-order

concavity of an entropic function of a continuous random variable under a
scaled addition rule: $$f(\sqrt{a}\,X + \sqrt{1-a}\,Y) \ge a f(X) + (1-a) f(Y)
\quad \forall \, a \in [0,1].$$ Here, $X$ and $Y$ are continuous random
variables and the function $f$ is either the differential entropy or the
entropy power. K\""onig and Smith [arXiv:1205.3409] and De Palma, Mari, and
Giovannetti [arXiv:1402.0404] obtained quantum analogues of these inequalities
for continuous-variable quantum systems, where $X$ and $Y$ are replaced by
bosonic fields and the addition rule is the action of a beamsplitter with
transmissivity $a$ on those fields. In this paper, we similarly establish a
class of EPI analogues for $d$-level quantum systems (i.e. qudits). The
underlying addition rule for which these inequalities hold is given by a
quantum channel that depends on the parameter $a \in [0,1]$ and acts like a
finite-dimensional analogue of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$,
converting a two-qudit product state into a single qudit state. We refer to
this channel as a partial swap channel because of the particular way its output
interpolates between the states of the two qudits in the input as $a$ is
changed from zero to one. We obtain analogues of Shannon's EPI, not only for
the von Neumann entropy and the entropy power for the output of such channels,
but for a much larger class of functions as well. This class includes the
R\'enyi entropies and the subentropy. We also prove a qudit analogue of the
entropy photon number inequality (EPnI). Finally, for the subclass of partial
swap channels for which one of the qudit states in the input is fixed, our EPIs

environments and their host galaxies are among the most massive systems at
those redshifts, providing key insights for galaxy evolution. Finding
radio-loud quasars at the highest accessible redshifts (z~6) is important to
study their properties and environments at even earlier cosmic time. They would
also serve as background sources for radio surveys intended to study the
intergalactic medium beyond the epoch of reionization in HI 21 cm absorption.
Currently, only five radio-loud ($R=f_{\nu,5{\rm GHz}}/f_{\nu,4400\AA}>10$)
quasars are known at z~6. In this paper we search for 5.5 < z < 7.2 quasars by
cross-matching the optical Pan-STARRS1 and radio FIRST surveys. The radio
information allows identification of quasars missed by typical color-based
selections. While we find no good 6.4 < z <7.2 quasar candidates at the
sensitivities of these surveys, we discover two new radio-loud quasars at z~6.
Furthermore, we identify two additional z~6 radio-loud quasars which were not
previously known to be radio-loud, nearly doubling the current z~6 sample. We
show the importance of having infrared photometry for z>5.5 quasars to robustly
classify them as radio-quiet or radio-loud. Based on this, we reclassify the
quasar J0203+0012 (z=5.72), previously considered radio-loud, to be
radio-quiet. Using the available data in the literature, we constrain the
radio-loud fraction of quasars at z~6, using the Kaplan--Meier estimator, to be
$8.1^{+5.0}_{-3.2}\%$. This result is consistent with there being no evolution
of the radio-loud fraction with redshift, in contrast to what has been
suggested by some studies at lower redshifts.

experience a quasistatic evolution, returning a final population that is close
to a Boltzmann distribution of the Hamiltonian at a single (freeze-out) point
during the annealing. Such a system is expected to correlate well with a proper
quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It may also correlate with simulated annealing
if at the freeze-out point the quantum energy eigenvalues are close to the
classical ones. These correlations are just signatures of equilibration and do
not mean that the evolution of the quantum annealer is classical or can be
simulated by quantum Monte Carlo. The computation time extracted from such a
distribution reflects the equilibrium behavior and therefore provides no
information about the underlying quantum dynamics. This makes the search for
quantum speedup in suboptimal quantum annealers problematic. We use an open
quantum master equation with realistic parameters to illustrate quasistatic
evolution in a 16 qubit quantum annealer and discuss its implication for
quantum speedup.

relation of the jet kinematics to the observed broadband flux variability. We
find significant non-radial motions in the jet outflow of the source. In the
radial direction, the highest measured apparent speed is \sim37 c, which is
exceptionally high, especially for a BL Lac object. Patterns in the jet flow
reveal a roughly stationary feature \sim0.15 mas downstream of the core. The
long-term fits to the component trajectories reveal acceleration in the sub-mas
region of the jet. The measured brightness temperature, T_{B}, follows a
continuous trend of decline with distance, T_B \propto
r_{jet}^{-(2.36\pm0.41)}, which suggests a gradient in Doppler factor along the
jet axis. Our analysis suggest that a moving disturbance (or a shock wave) from
the base of the jet produces the high-energy (optical to \gamma-ray) variations
upstream of the 7 mm core, and then later causes an outburst in the core.
Repetitive optical/\gamma-ray flares and the curved trajectories of the
associated components suggest that the shock front propagates along a bent
trajectory or helical path. Sharper \gamma-ray flares could be related to the
passage of moving disturbances through the stationary feature. Our analysis
suggests that the \gamma-ray and radio emission regions have different Doppler
factors.

antibody-coding B cell receptor (BCR) sequences for a remarkable diversity of
antigens. It is now possible to sequence these BCRs in high throughput;
analysis of these sequences is bringing new insight into how antibodies
develop, in particular for broadly-neutralizing antibodies against HIV and
influenza. A fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each
base as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or from an
N-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous work has used simple
parametric distributions to model transitions from state to state in a hidden
Markov model (HMM) of VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via
the same process across sites. However, codon frame and other effects have been
observed to violate these parametric assumptions for such coding sequences,
suggesting that a non-parametric approach to modeling the recombination process
could be useful. In our paper, we find that indeed large modern data sets
suggest a model using parameter-rich per-allele categorical distributions for
HMM transition probabilities and per-allele-per-position mutation
probabilities, and that using such a model for inference leads to significantly
improved results. We present an accurate and efficient BCR sequence annotation

simulation is carried out in a spherical shell that encompasses 3.8 density
scale heights of the solar convection zone. It is found that dynamo action with
a high degree of time variation occurs, with many periodic polarity reversals
occurring roughly every 6.2 years. The magnetic energy also rises and falls
with a regular period. The magnetic energy cycles arise from a Lorentz-force
feedback on the differential rotation, whereas the processes leading to
polarity reversals are more complex, appearing to arise from the interaction of
convection with the mean toroidal fields. Moreover, an equatorial migration of
toroidal field is found, which is linked to the changing differential rotation,

if interpreted in a supersymmetric framework, be a smoking gun signature of
non-minimal supersymmetry. In this work in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model we focus on vector boson fusion and
Higgs-strahlung production of heavier scalars that subsequently decay into
pairs of light pseudoscalars. We demonstrate that although these channels have
in general very limited reach, they are viable for the detection of light
pseudoscalars in some parts of parameter space and can serve as an important
complementary probe to the dominant gluon-fusion production mode. We also
demonstrate that in a Higgsfactory these channels may reach sensitivities
comparable to or even exceeding the gluon fusion channels at the LHC, thus
possibly rendering this our best option to discover a light pseudoscalar. It is
also worth mentioning that for the singlet dominated scalar this may be the
only way to measure its couplings to gauge bosons. Especially promising are
channels where the initial scalar is radiated off a W as these events have
relatively high rates and provide substantial background suppression due to
leptons from the W. We identify three benchmark points that well represent the
above scenarios. Assuming that the masses of the scalars and pseudoscalars are
already measured in the gluon-fusion channel, the event kinematics can be
further constrained, hence significantly improving detection prospects. This is
especially important in the Higgs-strahlung channels with rather heavy scalars,
and results in possible detection at 200/fb for the most favoured parts of the
parameter space.

However, the exact relation between the GRB rate and the star formation rate

Host (TOUGH) survey includes observations of all GRB hosts (69) in an optically

consistent with a luminosity function derived from SFR weighted models

significance of this shortfall is limited by nine hosts of unknown redshift.

demonstrates that the network coverage probability first increases with the

rule out events $\sim40$ days before the main peak caused by initially faint

outage occurs when either the transmitter or the receiver does not have enough

retransmission, we prove that threshold-based power control policies are
optimal. We thus propose disjoint/joint threshold-based policies with and
without battery state sharing between the transmitter and receiver,

with linear power levels is adopted to adapt the power thresholds per

Markov chain is formulated to calculate the optimal parameters and
corresponding performance of proposed policies. The energy arrival correlation
between the transmitter and receiver is addressed for both finite and infinite

transmissions to the intended user. The radar operates in two modes,
interference-mitigation mode when it avoids interference with the CoMP system
and cooperation mode when it exchanges information with it. Using either the
conventional Switched Null Space Projection (SNSP) or the newly proposed
Switched Small Singular Value Space Projection (SSSVSP), the radar beam sweeps
across the BS clusters focusing on the optimal ones, optimal in either nullity
or difference between the precoded and original radar signal. Taking the
channel estimation error into account, the design of precoder is pivoted on the
minimal radar interference at the BS clusters during interference-mitigation
mode and minimal bit-error-rate at the BSs during cooperation mode while
interfering minimally with the radar target detection capability. Our
investigation shows that loss in radar performance can be compensated using
SSSVSP instead of SNSP to some extent but increasing the number of radar
antenna elements goes a long way to serve the purpose. Simulations verify our
theoretical predictions about the proposed SSSVSP.

also their conjunction when one or both concepts are negated, namely, 'Fruits

revealing systematic and remarkable deviations from classical (fuzzy set) logic

considerable evidence to the validity of our quantum-theoretic framework for
the combination of two concepts. Indeed, the representation of conceptual
negation naturally arises from the general assumptions of our two-sector Fock

with a carbon-oxygen core surrounded by an oxygen-neon mantle. Being born with
masses ~1.1 Msun, hybrid WDs in a binary system may easily approach the
Chandrasekhar mass (MCh) by accretion and give rise to a thermonuclear
explosion. Here, we investigate an off-centre deflagration in a near-MCh hybrid
WD under the assumption that nuclear burning only occurs in carbon-rich
material. Performing hydrodynamics simulations of the explosion and detailed
nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations, we find that only 0.014 Msun of
material is ejected while the remainder of the mass stays bound. The ejecta
consist predominantly of iron-group elements, O, C, Si and S. We also calculate
synthetic observables for our model and find reasonable agreement with the
faint Type Iax SN 2008ha. This shows for the first time that deflagrations in
near-MCh WDs can in principle explain the observed diversity of Type Iax
supernovae. Leaving behind a near-MCh bound remnant opens the possibility for
recurrent explosions or a subsequent accretion-induced collapse in faint Type
Iax SNe, if further accretion episodes occur. From binary population synthesis
calculations, we find the rate of hybrid WDs approaching MCh to be on the order
of 1 percent of the Galactic SN Ia rate.

we routinely encounter high-throughput datasets in complex biological and
environment research. Most Bayesian variable selection methods are restricted
to mixture priors having separate components for characterizing the signal and
the noise. However, such priors encounter computational issues in high
dimensions. This has motivated continuous shrinkage priors, resembling the
two-component priors facilitating computation and interpretability. While such
priors are widely used for estimating high-dimensional sparse vectors,
selecting a subset of variables remains a daunting task. In this article, we
propose a general approach for variable selection with shrinkage priors. The
presence of very few tuning parameters makes our method attractive in
comparison to adhoc thresholding approaches. The applicability of the approach
is not limited to continuous shrinkage priors, but can be used along with any
shrinkage prior. Theoretical properties for near-collinear design matrices are
investigated and the method is shown to have good performance in a wide range
of synthetic data examples.

apply a previously derived effective Hamiltonian for the $\pi$-bands of
graphene on h-BN to address the carrier-dependence of transport properties,
concentrating on the conductivity features at four electrons and four holes per
unit cell. These transport features measure the strength of Bragg scattering of
$\pi$-electrons off the moir\'e pattern, and exhibit a striking particle-hole
asymmetry that we trace to specific features of the effective Hamiltonian that
we interpret physically.

Kalman filtering theory since ancient times to the present. A brief description
of the filter equations its aesthetics, beauty, truth, fascinating perspectives
and competence are described. For a Kalman filter design to provide optimal
estimates tuning of its statistics namely initial state and covariance, unknown
parameters, and state and measurement noise covariances is important. The
earlier tuning approaches are reviewed. The present approach is a reference
recursive recipe based on multiple filter passes through the data without any
optimization to reach a `statistical equilibrium' solution. It utilizes the a
priori, a posteriori, and smoothed states, their corresponding predicted
measurements and the actual measurements help to balance the measurement
equation and similarly the state equation to help form a generalized likelihood
cost function. The filter covariance at the end of each pass is heuristically
scaled up by the number of data points is further trimmed to statistically
match the exact estimates and Cramer Rao Bounds (CRBs) available with no
process noise provided the initial covariance for subsequent passes. During
simulation studies with process noise the matching of the input and estimated
noise sequence over time and in real data the generalized cost functions helped
to obtain confidence in the results. Simulation studies of a constant signal, a
ramp, a spring, mass, damper system with a weak non linear spring constant,
longitudinal and lateral motion of an airplane was followed by similar but more
involved real airplane data was carried out in MATLAB. In all cases the present
approach was shown to provide internally consistent and best possible estimates
and their CRBs.

  Data-Center Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The size of modern data centers is constantly increasing. As it is not
economic to interconnect all machines in the data center using a
full-bisection-bandwidth network, techniques have to be developed to increase
the efficiency of data-center networks. The Software-Defined Network paradigm
opened the door for centralized traffic engineering (TE) in such environments.
Up to now, there were already a number of TE proposals for SDN-controlled data
centers that all work very well. However, these techniques either use a high
amount of flow table entries or a high flow installation rate that overwhelms
available switching hardware, or they require custom or very expensive
end-of-line equipment to be usable in practice.
  We present HybridTE, a TE technique that uses (uncertain) information about
large flows. Using this extra information, our technique has very low hardware
requirements while maintaining better performance than existing TE techniques.
This enables us to build very low-cost, high performance data-center networks.

for these molecular systems can be interpreted in terms of probing large extra

than 50,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands and found significant superlinear
scaling of gross urban product with population size. Of these cities, 22 major
cities have urban agglomerations and urban areas defined by the Netherlands
Central Bureau of Statistics. For these major cities we investigated the
superlinear scaling for three separate modalities: the cities defined as
municipalities, their urban agglomerations and their urban areas. We find
superlinearity with power-law exponents of around 1.15. But remarkably, both
types of agglomerations underperform if we compare for the same size of
population an agglomeration with a city as a municipality. In other words, an
urban system as one formal municipality performs better as compared to an urban
agglomeration with the same population size. This effect is larger for the
second type of agglomerations, the urban areas. We think this finding has
important implications for urban policy, in particular municipal
reorganizations. A residual analysis suggests that cities with a municipal
reorganization recently and in the past decades have a higher probability to
perform better than cities without municipal restructuring.

relativity, Einstein's initial idea was a variable speed of light theory.
Indeed space-time curvature can be mimicked by a speed of light $c(r)$ that
depends on the distribution of masses. Einstein's 1911 theory was considerably
improved by Robert Dicke in 1957, but only recently has the equivalence of the
variable speed of light approach to the conventional formalism been
demonstrated (Broekaert, 2008). Using Green's functions, we show that
Einstein's 1911 idea can be expressed in an analytic form, similar to the
Poisson equation. Using heuristic arguments, we derive a simple formula that
directly relates curvature $w$ to the local speed of light, $w= -c^2 \Delta
\frac{1}{c^2}$. In contrast to the conventional formulation, this allows for a
Machian interpretation of general relativity and the gravitational constant
$G$. Gravity, though described by local equations, has its origin in all other
masses in the universe.

In this context, we introduce a descriptor which combines the shape and color
descriptors to have an effectiveness description of birds. The proposed
descriptor is an adaptation of a descriptor based on the contours defined in
article Belongie et al. [5] combined with color moments [19]. Specifically,
points of interest are extracted from each image and information's in the
region in the vicinity of these points are represented by descriptors of shape
context concatenated with color moments. Thus, the approach bag of visual words
is applied to the latter. The experimental results show the effectiveness of
our descriptor for the bird search by content.
