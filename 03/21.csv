scenario with tree level mass difference 3.55 keV such that the heavier one can
decay into the lighter one and a photon with energy 3.55 keV. The lighter dark
matter candidate is protected from decaying into the standard model particles
by a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry into which the abelian gauge symmetry gets
spontaneously broken. If the mass of the dark matter particle is chosen to be
within $31-40$ GeV, then this model can also explain the galactic center gamma
ray excess if the dark matter annihilation into $b\bar{b}$ pairs has a cross
section of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq (1.4-2.0) \times 10^{-26} \;
\text{cm}^3/\text{s}$. We constrain the model from the requirement of producing
correct dark matter relic density, 3.55 keV X-ray line flux and galactic center
gamma ray excess. We also impose the bounds coming from dark matter direct
detection experiments as well as collider limits on additional gauge boson mass
and gauge coupling. We also briefly discuss how this model can give rise to
sub-eV neutrino masses at tree level as well as one-loop level while keeping
the dark matter mass at few tens of GeV. We also constrain the model parameters
from the requirement of keeping the one-loop mass difference between two dark
matter particles below a keV. We find that the constraints from light neutrino
mass and keV mass splitting between two dark matter components show more
preference for opposite $CP$ eigenvalues of the two fermion singlet dark matter

Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) was recently proposed as a
general-purpose access control paradigm for application domains in which
authorization must take into account the relationship between the access
requestor and the resource owner. The healthcare domain is envisioned to be an
archetypical application domain in which ReBAC is sorely needed: e.g., my
patient record should be accessible only by my family doctor, but not by all
doctors.
  In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that ReBAC can be
incorporated into a production-scale medical records system, OpenMRS, with
backward compatibility to the legacy RBAC mechanism. Specifically, we extend
the access control mechanism of OpenMRS to enforce ReBAC policies. Our
extensions incorporate and extend advanced ReBAC features recently proposed by
Crampton and Sellwood. In addition, we designed and implemented the first
administrative model for ReBAC. In this paper, we describe our ReBAC
implementation, discuss the system engineering lessons learnt as a result, and
evaluate the experimental work we have undertaken. In particular, we compare
the performance of the various authorization schemes we implemented, thereby
demonstrating the feasibility of ReBAC.

We have observed these clumps in $^{13}$CO (1-0), C$^{18}$O (1-0), and
N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) lines. Aims. Our aim is to find out if these cold clumps are
prestellar. We have examined to what extent independent analysis of the dust
and the molecular lines lead to similar conclusions about the masses of these
objects. Methods. We calculate the clump masses and densities from the dust
continuum and molecular line observations and compare these to each other and
to the virial and Bonnor-Ebert masses calculated for each clump. Finally we
examine two of the fields with radiative transfer models to estimate CO
abundances. Results. When excitation temperatures could be estimated, the
column densities derived from molecular line observations were comparable to
those from dust continuum data. The median column density estimates are
4.2$\times 10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$ and 5.5$\times 10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$ for the line and
dust emission data, respectively. The calculated abundances, column densities,
volume densities, and masses all have large uncertainties and one must be
careful when drawing conclusions. Abundance of $^{13}$CO was found in modeling
the two clumps in the field G131.65$+$9.75 to be close to the usual value of
10$^{-6}$. The abundance ratio of $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O was $\sim$10.
Molecular abundances could only be estimated with modeling, relying on dust
column density data. Conclusions. The results indicate that most cold clumps,
even those with dust color temperatures close to 11 K, are not necessarily
prestellar.

computational model to reproduce the probability of glioma incidence across the

in a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical findings. To
decrease this gap between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate
recent data on cellular and molecular factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since
evidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-of-origin of
glioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem
cell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our
model. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual
demographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts
for the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age,
without the need to assert differential susceptibility throughout the
population. Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that glioma is caused by
randomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population.
Based on this model, we assess the influence of the (experimentally indicated)
decrease in the number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate
during aging. Our model provides multiple testable predictions, and suggests
that different temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to
tumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or five oncogenic mutations are
sufficient for the formation of glioma.

hierarchical model which we introduce here, members of the same household are
also members of the same school.
  We introduce computable branching process approximations for both types of
populations and use these to compare the probabilities of a large outbreak. The
branching process approximation in the hierarchical model is novel and of
independent interest. We prove by a coupling argument that if all households
and schools have the same size, an epidemic spreads easier (in the sense that
the number of individuals infected is stochastically larger) in the independent
partition model. We also show by example that this result does not necessarily
hold if households and/or schools do not all have the same size.

distribution with $\sim 20\%$ higher density in the equatorial plane than at
the poles. To model the 2010 outburst, we consider several physical parameters,

A detailed study of the shock interaction and evolution reveals that the
interaction of shocks with the red giant wind generates strong Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. In addition, the presence of the companion and circumstellar
density enhancement greatly alter the shock evolution during the nova phase.
The ejecta speed after sweeping out most of the circumstellar medium decreases
to $\sim 100-300$ km-s$^{-1}$, depending on model, which is consistent with the

An infinite permutation can be defined by a sequence of real numbers where only
the order of elements is taken into account. In the paper we investigate a new
class of {\it equidistributed} infinite permutations, that is, infinite
permutations which can be defined by equidistributed sequences. Similarly to
infinite words, a complexity $p(n)$ of an infinite permutation is defined as a
function counting the number of its subpermutations of length $n$. For infinite
words, a classical result of Morse and Hedlund, 1938, states that if the
complexity of an infinite word satisfies $p(n) \leq n$ for some $n$, then the
word is ultimately periodic. Hence minimal complexity of aperiodic words is
equal to $n+1$, and words with such complexity are called Sturmian. For
infinite permutations this does not hold: There exist aperiodic permutations
with complexity functions growing arbitrarily slowly, and hence there are no
permutations of minimal complexity. We show that, unlike for permutations in
general, the minimal complexity of an equidistributed permutation $\alpha$ is
$p_{\alpha}(n)=n$. The class of equidistributed permutations of minimal
complexity coincides with the class of so-called Sturmian permutations,
directly related to Sturmian words.

  Purpose: To use the experimentally measured three-body correlations to gain
insight into the properties of O26, including the decay mechanism and
ground-state resonance energy.
  Method: O26 was produced in a one-proton knockout reaction from F27 and the
O24+n+n decay products were measured using the MoNA-Sweeper setup. The
three-body correlations from the O26 ground-state resonance decay were
extracted. The experimental results were compared to Monte Carlo simulations in
which the resonance energy and decay mechanism were varied.
  Results: The measured three-body correlations were well reproduced by the
Monte Carlo simulations but were not sensitive to the decay mechanism due to
the experimental resolutions. However, the three-body correlations were found
to be sensitive to the resonance energy of O26. A 1{\sigma} upper limit of 53
keV was extracted for the ground-state resonance energy of O26.
  Conclusions: Future attempts to measure the three-body correlations from the
ground-state decay of O26 will be very challenging due to the need for a
precise measurement of the O24 momentum at the reaction point in the target.

$n(X) = \displaystyle\lim_m n(X_m).$ For the case in which $ \mathbb{N}$ is

the two-site Hubbard Model (HM) have been studied. They have been found for
three-point vertices of increasing complexity ($\Gamma=1$ (GW approximation),
$\Gamma_{1}$ from the first order perturbation theory, and exact vertex
$\Gamma_{E}$). The comparison is being made when an additional quasiparticle
(QP) approximation for the Green function is applied during the self-consistent
iterative solving of HE and when QP approximation is not applied. The results
obtained with the exact vertex are directly related to the presently open
question - which approximation is more advantageous for future implementations
- GW+DMFT or QPGW+DMFT. It is shown that in the regime of strong correlations
only originally proposed GW+DMFT scheme is able to provide reliable results.
Vertex corrections based on Perturbation Theory (PT) systematically improve the
GW results when full self-consistency is applied. The application of the QP
self-consistency combined with PT vertex corrections shows similar problems to
the case when the exact vertex is applied combined with QP sc. The analysis of
Ward Identity violation is performed for all studied in this work

Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, displaying a large J-to-K-band
flux reversal ($\Delta$J = -0.45$\pm$0.09 mag, $\Delta$K = 0.52$\pm$0.05 mag).
We determine a total dynamical mass from Keck orbital monitoring (88$\pm$5
$M_{\rm Jup}$) and a mass ratio by measuring the photocenter orbit from
CFHT/WIRCam absolute astrometry ($M_B/M_A$ = 0.78$\pm$0.07). Combining these
provides the first individual dynamical masses for any field L or T dwarfs,
49$\pm$3 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the L6.5$\pm$1.5 primary and 39$\pm$3 $M_{\rm Jup}$
for the T1.5$\pm$1.0 secondary. Such a low mass ratio for a nearly equal
luminosity binary implies a shallow mass$-$luminosity relation over the L/T
transition ($\Delta$log$L_{\rm bol}$/$\Delta$log$M = 0.6^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$). This
provides the first observational support that cloud dispersal plays a
significant role in the luminosity evolution of substellar objects. Fully
cloudy models fail our coevality test for this binary, giving ages for the two
components that disagree by 0.2 dex (2.0$\sigma$). In contrast, our observed
masses and luminosities can be reproduced at a single age by ""hybrid""
evolutionary tracks where a smooth change from a cloudy to cloudless
photosphere around 1300 K causes slowing of luminosity evolution. Remarkably,
such models also match our observed JHK flux ratios and colors well. Overall,
it seems that the distinguishing features SDSSJ1052+4422AB, like a J-band flux
reversal and high-amplitude variability, are normal for a field L/T binary
caught during the process of cloud dispersal, given that the age
(1.11$^{+0.17}_{-0.20}$ Gyr) and surface gravity (log$g$ = 5.0$-$5.2) of

larger at higher temperatures but clearly saturate as temperature is lowered,

continue to rise near half filling. This rise is even more dramatic in the
d-wave susceptibility. The convergence of NLCEs breaks down as the

non--Gaussian features potentially containing the majority of the information.
We examine constraints on the parameter triplet $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$ from
non-Gaussian features of the weak lensing convergence field, including a set of
moments (up to $4^{\rm th}$ order) and Minkowski functionals, using publicly
available data from the 154deg$^2$ CFHTLenS survey. We utilize a suite of
ray--tracing N-body simulations spanning 91 points in $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$
parameter space, replicating the galaxy sky positions, redshifts and shape
noise in the CFHTLenS catalogs. We then build an emulator that interpolates the
simulated descriptors as a function of $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$, and use it to
compute the likelihood function and parameter constraints. We employ a
principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality and to help stabilize the
constraints with respect to the number of bins used to construct each
statistic. Using the full set of statistics, we find
$\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.27)^{0.55}=0.75\pm0.04$ (68% C.L.), in
agreement with previous values. We find that constraints on the
$(\Omega_m,\sigma_8)$ doublet from the Minkowski functionals suffer a strong
bias. However, high-order moments break the $(\Omega_m,\sigma_8)$ degeneracy
and provide a tight constraint on these parameters with no apparent bias. The
main contribution comes from quartic moments of derivatives.

GW emitted by compact (neutron star/black hole) binary mergers. If one of those
is a neutron star the merger will also emit electromagnetic radiation via three
possible channels: Gamma-ray bursts and their (possibly orphan) afterglows
(Eichler et al. 1989), Li-Paczynski Macronovae (Li & Paczynski 1998) and radio
flares (Nakar & Piran 2011). This accompanying electromagnetic radiation is
vitally important in confirming the GW detections (Kochanek & Piran 1993). It
could also reveal a wealth of information regarding the merger and will open a
window towards multi-messenger astronomy. Identifying and characterizing these
counterparts is therefore of utmost importance. In this work we explore late
time radio flares emitted by the dynamically ejected outflows. We build upon
previous work and consider the effect of the outflow's non-trivial geometry.
Using an approximate method we estimate the radio light-curves for several
ejected matter distributions obtained in numerical simulations. Our method
provides an upper limit to the effect of non-sphericity. Together with the
spherical estimates the resulting light curves bound the actual signal. We find
that while non-spherical geometries can in principle lead to an enhanced
emission, in most cases they result in an increase in the timescale compared
with a corresponding spherical configuration. This would weaken somewhat these
signals and might decrease the detection prospects.

supported disks. In this paper we discuss how a classification based on
canonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar mass
maps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification of
clumpy but not merging galaxies. We calibrate the mass-based selection of
mergers using the MIRAGE hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated and
merging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of
$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}M_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3. These
simulations are processed to reproduce the typical depth and spatial resolution
of observed HUDF data. We test our approach on a sample of real z~2 galaxies
with kinematic classification into disks or mergers and on ~100 galaxies in the
HUDF field with photometric/spectroscopic redshift between 1.5$\leqslant z
\leqslant$3 and $M>10^{9.4}M_{sun}$. We find that a combination of the
asymmetry $A_{MASS}$ and $M_{20, MASS}$ indices measured on the stellar mass
maps can efficiently identify real (major) mergers with $\lesssim$20%
contamination from clumpy disks in the merger sample. This mass-based
classification cannot be reproduced in star-forming galaxies by $H-$band
measurements alone, which instead result in a contamination from clumpy
galaxies that can be as high as 50%. Moreover, we find that the mass-based
classification always results in a lower contamination from clumpy galaxies
than an $H-$band classification, regardless of the depth of the imaging used
(e.g., CANDELS vs. HUDF).

understanding of the properties of numerical methods when the wavenumber is
real and complex. Numerical methods of the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
type are considered for simulating waves that satisfy the Helmholtz and Maxwell
equations. It is shown that these methods, when wrongly used, give rise to
singular systems for complex wavenumbers. A sufficient condition on the HDG
stabilization parameter for guaranteeing unique solvability of the numerical
HDG system, both for Helmholtz and Maxwell systems, is obtained for complex
wavenumbers. For real wavenumbers, results from a dispersion analysis are
presented. An asymptotic expansion of the dispersion relation, as the number of
mesh elements per wave increase, reveal that some choices of the stabilization
parameter are better than others. To summarize the findings, there are values
of the HDG stabilization parameter that will cause the HDG method to fail for
complex wavenumbers. However, this failure is remedied if the real part of the
stabilization parameter has the opposite sign of the imaginary part of the
wavenumber. When the wavenumber is real, values of the stabilization parameter
that asymptotically minimize the HDG wavenumber errors are found on the
imaginary axis. Finally, a dispersion analysis of the mixed hybrid
Raviart-Thomas method showed that its wavenumber errors are an order smaller

state"" of the entire system, which exhibits a universal ideal thermodynamic
behavior. Fluctuating macroscopic quantities are studied from the stochastic
thermodynamic point of view and a non-equilibrium work relation is obtained in
the macroscopic picture, which may facilitate experimental study and
application of the equalities due to Jarzynski, Crooks, and Hatano and Sasa.

Version 2: Some remarks added and typos fixed",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The scaling behaviour of euclidean quantum gravity at an asymptotically safe
critical point is studied by means of the exact renormalisation group. Gauge
independence is ensured via a specific parameterisation of metric fluctuations
introduced in a recent paper. Within a non-perturbative approximation the beta
function for Newton's constant takes a simple form to all orders in $\hbar$. A
UV fixed point is found to exist for $d\leq 7$ spacetime dimensions at which
the critical scaling can be assessed. The critical exponent for the Newton's
constant $\nu$ is found to be regulator independent close to two dimensions.
Applying Litim's optimisation criteria we find $\nu \approx 1/3$ in four
spacetime dimensions. This value is in agreement with lattice studies
supporting the existence of a second order phase transition between strongly
and weakly coupled phases.

performance of cellular networks at low infrastructure cost, but at the same
time, they can aggravate the interference issue. In this paper, we analyze for
several relay coding schemes the maximum energy gain provided by a relay,
taking into account the additional relay-generated interference to neighboring
cells. First, we define spatial areas for relaying efficiency in log-normal
shadowing environments and propose three easily-computable and tractable
models. These models allow the prediction of 1) the probability of
energy-efficient relaying, 2) the spatial distribution of energy consumption
within a cell and 3) the average interference generated by relays. Second, we
define a new performance metric that jointly captures both aspects of energy
and interference, and characterize the optimal number and location of relays.
These results are obtainable with significantly lower complexity and execution
time when applying the proposed models as compared to system simulations.We
highlight that energy-efficient relay deployment does not necessarily lead to
interference reduction and conversely, an interference-aware deployment is
suboptimal in the energy consumption. We then propose a map showing the optimal
utilization of relay coding schemes across a cell. This map combines two-hop
relaying and energy-optimized partial decode-forward as a function of their
respective circuitry consumption. Such a combination not only alleviates the
interference issue, but also leads to a reduction in the number of relays
required for the same performance.

calculation of the stationary distribution computationally feasible. The
transition probabilities of this embedded Markov chain involve fixation
probabilities of mutants in single populations. The asymmetry of the underlying
game leads to fixation probabilities that are derived from
frequency-independent selection, in contrast to the analogous single-population
symmetric-game case (Fudenberg and Imhof 2006). This frequency independence is
useful in that it allows us to employ results from the population genetics

the utility of this approach by applying it to a battle-of-the-sexes game, a

  Our answer to the first question is representations of the based loop group.
More precisely, we identify a certain class of projective unitary
representations of the based loop group $\Omega G$ that we locally normal
representations. We define the fusion product of such representations and we
prove that, modulo certain conjectures, the Drinfel'd centre of that
representation category of $\Omega G$ is equivalent to the category of positive
energy representations of the free loop group $LG$. The above mentioned
conjectures are known to hold when the gauge group is abelian or of type $A_1$.
  Our answer to the second question is bicommutant categories. The latter are
higher categorical analogs of von Neumann algebras: they are tensor categories
that are equivalent to their bicommutant inside $\mathrm{Bim}(R)$, the category
of bimodules over a hyperfinite $\mathit{III}_1$ factor. We prove that, modulo
certain conjectures, the category of locally normal representations of the
based loop group is a bicommutant category. The relevant conjectures are known
to hold when the gauge group is abelian or of type $A_n$.
  Our work builds on the formalism of coordinate free conformal nets, developed
jointly with A. Bartels and C. Douglas.

first establish the class of beams that being transmitted through the phase

photon number in the mode, the deviation of $g^{(2)}(t)$ from unity is so small
that even a tiny error in measuring $g^{(2)}(t)$ would result in an inaccurate

well-established sub-Poissonian light source, we measured $g^{(2)}(t)$ with two
different types of photodetectors with different dead time. We also introduced
prolonged dead time by intentionally deleting the photodetection events
following a preceding one within a specified time interval. We found that the
observed Q of the cavity-QED microlaser was underestimated by 19% with respect

typically occurs in localized areas in the absence of collapse. This prior
information about the spatial sparseness of structural damage is exploited here
by a hierarchical sparse Bayesian learning framework with the goal of reducing
the source of ill-conditioning in the stiffness loss inversion problem for
damage detection. Sparse Bayesian learning methodologies automatically prune
away irrelevant or inactive features from a set of potential candidates, and so
they are effective probabilistic tools for producing sparse explanatory
subsets. We have previously proposed such an approach to establish the
probability of localized stiffness reductions that serve as a proxy for damage
by using noisy incomplete modal data from before and after possible damage. The
core idea centers on a specific hierarchical Bayesian model that promotes
spatial sparseness in the inferred stiffness reductions in a way that is
consistent with the Bayesian Ockham razor. In this paper, we improve the theory
of our previously proposed sparse Bayesian learning approach by eliminating an
approximation and, more importantly, incorporating a constraint on stiffness
increases. Our approach has many appealing features that are summarized at the
end of the paper. We validate the approach by applying it to the Phase II
simulated and experimental benchmark studies sponsored by the IASC-ASCE Task
Group on Structural Health Monitoring. The results show that it can reliably
detect, locate and assess damage by inferring substructure stiffness losses
from the identified modal parameters. The occurrence of missed and false damage
alerts is effectively suppressed.

published articles in general follows a universal pattern - an initial growth
in the number of citations within the first two to three years after
publication followed by a steady peak of one to two years and then a final
decline over the rest of the lifetime of the article. This observation has long
been the underlying heuristic in determining major bibliometric factors such as
the quality of a publication, the growth of scientific communities, impact
factor of publication venues etc. In this paper, we gather and analyze a
massive dataset of scientific papers from the computer science domain and
notice that the citation count of the articles over the years follows a
remarkably diverse set of patterns - a profile with an initial peak (PeakInit),
with distinct multiple peaks (PeakMul), with a peak late in time (PeakLate),
that is monotonically decreasing (MonDec), that is monotonically increasing
(MonIncr) and that can not be categorized into any of the above (Oth). We
conduct a thorough experiment to investigate several important characteristics
of these categories such as how individual categories attract citations, how
the categorization is influenced by the year and the venue of publication of
papers, how each category is affected by self-citations, the stability of the
categories over time, and how much each of these categories contribute to the
core of the network. Further, we show that the traditional preferential
attachment models fail to explain these citation profiles. Therefore, we
propose a novel dynamic growth model that takes both the preferential
attachment and the aging factor into account in order to replicate the
real-world behavior of various citation profiles. We believe that this paper
opens the scope for a serious re-investigation of the existing bibliometric
indices for scientific research.

repositories, document corpuses, image sets and Internet routing history.
Proximity search and clustering are two algorithmic primitives fundamental to
data analysis, but suffer from the ""curse of dimensionality"" on these gigantic
datasets. A popular attack for this problem is to convert object
representations into short binary codewords, while approximately preserving
near neighbor structure. However, there has been limited research on
constructing codewords in the ""streaming"" or ""online"" settings often applicable
to this scale of data, where one may only make a single pass over data too
massive to fit in local memory.
  In this paper, we apply recent advances in matrix sketching techniques to
construct binary codewords in both streaming and online setting. Our
experimental results compete outperform several of the most popularly used
algorithms, and we prove theoretical guarantees on performance in the streaming
setting under mild assumptions on the data and randomness of the training set.

  topology",,,,,"cs.GT physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evolutionary game theory is used to model the evolution of competing
strategies in a population of players. Evolutionary stability of a strategy is
a dynamic equilibrium, in which any competing mutated strategy would be wiped
out from a population. If a strategy is weak evolutionarily stable, the
competing strategy may manage to survive within the network. Understanding the
network-related factors that affect the evolutionary stability of a strategy
would be critical in making accurate predictions about the behaviour of a
strategy in a real-world strategic decision making environment. In this work,
we evaluate the effect of network topology on the evolutionary stability of a
strategy. We focus on two well-known strategies known as the Zero-determinant
strategy and the Pavlov strategy. Zero-determinant strategies have been shown
to be evolutionarily unstable in a well-mixed population of players. We
identify that the Zero-determinant strategy may survive, and may even dominate
in a population of players connected through a non-homogeneous network. We
introduce the concept of `topological stability' to denote this phenomenon. We
argue that not only the network topology, but also the evolutionary process
applied and the initial distribution of strategies are critical in determining
the evolutionary stability of strategies. Further, we observe that topological
stability could affect other well-known strategies as well, such as the general
cooperator strategy and the cooperator strategy. Our observations suggest that
the variation of evolutionary stability due to topological stability of
strategies may be more prevalent in the social context of strategic evolution,
in comparison to the biological context.

spin-orbit coupling, endows silicene with considerable advantages over graphene
in that the spin-split states in silicene are tunable with external fields.
Although the low-energy Dirac cone states lie at the heart of all novel quantum
phenomena in a pristine sheet of silicene, the question of whether or not these
key states can survive when silicene is grown or supported on a substrate
remains hotly debated. Here we report our direct observation of Dirac cones in
monolayer silicene grown on a Ag(111) substrate. By performing angle-resolved
photoemission measurements on silicene(3x3)/Ag(111), we reveal the presence of
six pairs of Dirac cones on the edges of the first Brillouin zone of Ag(111),
other than expected six Dirac cones at the K points of the primary
silicene(1x1) Brillouin zone. Our result shows clearly that the unusual Dirac
cone structure originates not from the pristine silicene alone but from the
combined effect of silicene(3x3) and the Ag(111) substrate. This study
identifies the first case of a new type of Dirac Fermion generated through the
interaction of two different constituents. Our observation of Dirac cones in

dissipative mechanism, extra higher regularity than that for the global-in-time
existence is usually imposed to obtain the optimal decay rates of classical

critical space. To overcome the outstanding difficulty, we develop a new

related to the integrability at the high-frequency part. Furthermore, by the
energy approach in terms of high-frequency and low-frequency decomposition, we
show the optimal decay rate for Timoshenko system in critical Besov spaces,
which improves previous works greatly.

Notably, off-line control design is conducted in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion

the evolution of a discrete quantum system and as such has a founding role in
the study of quantum computation. We contribute to the investigation of QW
phenomena by performing a detailed numerical study of discrete-time quantum
walks. In one dimension (1D), we compute the structure of the probability
distribution, which is not a smooth curve but shows oscillatory features on all
length scales. By analyzing walks up to $N$ = 1000000 steps, we discuss the
scaling characteristics and limiting forms of the QW in both real and Fourier
space. In 2D, with a view to ready experimental realization, we consider two
types of QW, one based on a four-faced coin and the other on sequential
flipping of a single two-faced coin. Both QWs may be generated using two
two-faced coins, which in the first case are completely unentangled and in the
second are maximally entangled. We draw on our 1D results to characterize the
properties of both walks, demonstrating maximal speed-up and emerging
semi-classical behavior in the maximally entangled QW.

of time reversal symmetry in an acoustic system is commonly realized with

in slowing down of other jobs present in the queue. In this paper, we formulate
the problem of Speed Up Scheduling without acquiring any additional resources

glass formation, but a general molecular theory that predicts how chemical
structure determines the properties of glass-forming polymers has been slow to
develop. While the generalized entropy theory (GET) explains the influence of
various molecular details on polymer glass formation, the application of the
GET has heretofore been limited to the use of the simplest polymer model in
which all united atom groups within the monomers of a species interact with a
common monomer averaged van der Waals energy. However, energetic
heterogeneities are ubiquitous within the monomers of real polymers, and their
implications for polymer glass formation remain to be investigated
theoretically. This paper uses an extension of the GET to explore the influence
of energetic heterogeneities within monomers upon the nature of polymer glass
formation. The present paper focuses on establishing general trends for the
variation of characteristic properties of glass formation, such as the isobaric
fragility parameter $m_P$ and the glass transition temperature $T_g$, with
molecular details, such as the specific interactions and chain stiffness. Our
computations confirm that the previously used model with monomer averaged
interactions correctly captures general trends in the variation of $m_P$ and
$T_g$ with various molecular parameters. More importantly, adjustment of the
energetic heterogeneities within monomers alone are shown to provide an
efficient mechanism for tailoring the properties of glass-forming polymers. The
variations of polymer properties along iso-fragility and iso-$T_g$ lines are
illustrated as important design tools for exhibiting the combined influence of
specific interactions and chain stiffness.

current density plays the role of the pseudovector charge density. In this
field-theoretic model, spin interactions are mediated by a single scalar gauge
boson in its antisymmetric tensor formulation. We show that these long range
spin interactions induce a gauge invariant photon mass in the one-loop
effective action. The fermion loop generates a coupling between photons and the
spin gauge boson, which acquires thus charge. This coupling represents also an
induced, gauge invariant, topological mass for the photons, leading to the
Meissner effect. The one-loop effective equations of motion for the charged
spin gauge boson are the London equations. We propose thus spin gauge
interactions as an alternative, topological mechanism for superconductivity in
which no spontaneous symmetry breaking is involved.

non linear operators $f(x) = 0$ with a tridiagonal dominant linear part. We
recast the operator equation into an equivalent Newton-like equation $x = T(x)
= x - Af(x)$, where $A$ is an approximate inverse of the derivative
$Df(\overline x)$ at an approximate solution $\overline x$. We present rigorous
computer-assisted calculations showing that $T$ is a contraction near
$\overline x$, thus yielding the existence of a solution. Since $Df(\overline

computation of $A$ is not straightforward. This paper provides ideas for
computing $A$, and proposes a new rigorous method for proving existence of
solutions of nonlinear operators with tridiagonal dominant linear part.

an important role in the treatment. Clinicians often conduct surveys to
understand the self-care behaviors in their patients. In this context, we
propose to use Self-Organising Maps (SOM) to explore the survey data for
assessing the self-care behaviors in Type-1 diabetic patients. Specifically,
SOM is used to visualize high dimensional similar patient profiles, which is
rarely discussed. Experiments demonstrate that our findings through SOM
analysis corresponds well to the expectations of the clinicians. In addition,
our findings inspire the experts to improve their understanding of the
self-care behaviors for their patients. The principle findings in our study
show: 1) patients who take correct dose of insulin, inject insulin at the right
time, 2) patients who take correct food portions undertake regular physical
activity and 3) patients who eat on time take correct food portions.

Important Financial Institution (SIFI) in a financial network by taking into
account both common idiosyncratic shocks and contagion through counterparty
exposures. We develop an efficient algorithm to rank financial institutions by
formulating a fixed point problem and reducing it to a non-smooth convex
optimization problem. We then study the underlying distribution of the proposed
metric and analyze the performance of the algorithm by using different
financial network structures. Overall, our findings suggest that the level of
interconnection and position of institutions in the financial network are
important elements to measure systemic risk and identify SIFIs. Results show
that increasing the levels of out- and in-degree connections of an institution
can have a diverse impact on its systemic ranking. Additionally, on the
empirical side, we investigate the factors which lead to the identification of
Global Systemic Important Banks (G-SIB) by using a panel dataset of the largest
banks in each country. Our empirical results supports the main findings of the
theoretical model.

genetic algorithms to optimize the orientation of gridshell bars in order to
minimize the stresses and therefore to avoid bar breakage during the

We then introduce a mechanical memory resistor which has M(x) independent of

memristance does not crucially involve inert mass. It is practically realizable
with a 1cm radius hollow sphere in heavy fuel oil with a temperature gradient.
It has a pinched hysteretic loop that collapses at high frequency in the v
versus p plot. The mechanical system clarifies the nature of memristor devices
that can be hypothesized on grounds of physical symmetries. We hypothesize a
missing mechanical perfect memristor, which must be crucially mass-involving
(MI) precisely like the 1971 implied EM memristor device needs magnetism. We
also construct MI memristive nano systems, which clarifies why perfect MI
memristors and EM memristors are still missing and likely impossible.
