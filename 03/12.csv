interplanetary space is one of the best ways to remotely deduce the
characteristics of solar accelerated electron beams and the solar wind plasma.
One feature of all type III bursts is the lowest frequency they reach (or
stopping frequency). This feature reflects the distance from the Sun that an
electron beam can drive the observable plasma emission mechanism. The stopping
frequency has never been systematically studied before from a theoretical
perspective. Using numerical kinetic simulations, we explore the different
parameters that dictate how far an electron beam can travel before it stops
inducing a significant level of Langmuir waves, responsible for plasma radio
emission. We use the quasilinear approach to model self-consistently the
resonant interaction between electrons and Langmuir waves in inhomogeneous
plasma, and take into consideration the expansion of the guiding magnetic flux
tube and the turbulent density of the interplanetary medium. We find that the
rate of radial expansion has a significant effect on the distance an electron
beam travels before enhanced leves of Langmuir waves, and hence radio waves,
cease. Radial expansion of the guiding magnetic flux tube rarefies the electron
stream to the extent that the density of non-thermal electrons is too low to
drive Langmuir wave production. The initial conditions of the electron beam
have a significant effect, where decreasing the beam density or increasing the
spectral index of injected electrons would cause higher type III stopping
frequencies. We also demonstrate how the intensity of large-scale density
fluctuations increases the highest frequency that Langmuir waves can be driven
by the beam and how the magnetic field geometry can be the cause of type III
bursts only observed at high coronal frequencies.

faster than a threshold value, a regime which may always be achieved by tuning
the coupling between the quantum probe and the environment inducing the noise.
Our scheme exploits time-dependent sensitivity of quantum systems to
decoherence and does not require dynamical control on the probes. We derive the
optimal interaction time and the optimal probe preparation, showing that it
corresponds to multiqubit GHZ states when entanglement is useful. We also show
robustness of the scheme against depolarization or dephasing of the probe, and
discuss simple measurements approaching optimal precision.

Therefore, a less restrictive criterion for parsimony of non-salient loadings

'buffered scales', which have been introduced by Cattell and Tsujioka (1964) as
optimal indicators of corresponding factors. Variables with positive and
negative loadings on an unwanted factor are balanced out in a buffered scale,
so that the variance of the unwanted factor is at minimum. It is proposed here
to specify a balance of positive and negative secondary loadings by means of
model constraints in order to achieve parsimony of loading patterns. The
specification of buffered simple structure by means of model constraints was
illustrated by means of a simulation study and an empirical example.

outbursts during our long-term monitoring campaign of ~monthly observations of
the M31 center with Chandra. However, the decay profile appears to be unlike
those observed from Galactic transients. We followed up the 2011 outburst with
two ~B band HST/ACS observations, one in outburst and the other in quiescence,
and used difference imaging to search for a counterpart; this would be
dominated by re-processed X-ray emission from the disk. We found a counterpart
with B = 28.21+/-0.16. An XMM-Newton observation from a previous outburst
yielded a spectrum that is well described by an absorbed power law with
absorption equivalent to ~2.6 E+21 H atom cm^(-2) and photon index ~1.8; the
highest quality Chandra spectrum yielded only $\sim$130 counts, and best fits
consistent with the XMM-Newton results. We calculated an absolute V magnitude
of +1.9 during outburst for a typical disk spectrum. An empirical relation
between the ratio of X-ray to optical flux and orbital period suggests a period
< ~4 hr for a black hole accretor. Such a short period is expected to yield an
asymmetric, precessing disk, and we propose that the observed decay lightcurve
is due to modulation of the mass transfer rate due to the disk precession.

performed on cross section of the sample's surface region shows a 2 microns
thick Nb3Sn surface layer. The elemental composition map exhibits a Nb over Sn

Galactic Nucleus (AGN) should give rise to a gradient in the observed Faraday
rotation measure (RM) across the jet, due to the associated systematic change
in the line-of-sight magnetic field. Reports of observations of transverse RM
gradients across AGN jets have appeared in the literature starting from 2002,
but concerns were raised about the resolution required for these gradients to
be reliable, and there was a lack of a full understanding of the best approach
to accurate estimation of the uncertainties of local RM values. These questions
have now been resolved by recent Monte Carlo simulations carried out by various
groups, enabling both a verification of previously published results and
reliable analyses of new data. We consider here RM gradients across the jet
structures of 15 AGN, some previously published in the refereed literature but
without a correct and complete error analysis, and some published for the first
time here, all of which have monotonic transverse RM gradients with
significances of at least 3 sigma.

lattice, the critical string tension, at which the transition to a
topologically trivial phase takes place, can be obtained analytically and
agrees with the numerically determined value. Such a transition can be
generalized to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological model under a string tension and
determined in the same way. With different deformations, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$

momentum transfer from a now stripped-down, hot subdwarf companion. Here we
present the first high angular resolution images of phi Persei made possible by
new capabilities in longbaseline interferometry at near-IR and visible
wavelengths. We observed phi Persei with the MIRC and VEGA instruments of the
CHARA Array. Additional MIRC-only observations were performed to track the
orbital motion of the companion, and these were fit together with new and
existing radial velocity measurements of both stars to derive the complete
orbital elements and distance. The hot subdwarf companion is clearly detected
in the near-IR data at each epoch of observation with a flux contribution of
1.5% in the H band, and restricted fits indicate that its flux contribution
rises to 3.3% in the visible. A new binary orbital solution is determined by
combining the astrometric and radial velocity measurements. The derived stellar
masses are 9.6+-0.3Msol and 1.2+-0.2Msol for the Be primary and subdwarf
secondary, respectively. The inferred distance (186 +- 3 pc), kinematical
properties, and evolutionary state are consistent with membership of phi Persei
in the alpha Per cluster. From the cluster age we deduce significant
constraints on the initial masses and evolutionary mass transfer processes that
transformed the phi Persei binary system. The interferometric data place strong
constraints on the Be disk elongation, orientation, and kinematics, and the
disk angular momentum vector is coaligned with and has the same sense of
rotation as the orbital angular momentum vector. The VEGA visible continuum
data indicate an elongated shape for the Be star itself, due to the combined
effects of rapid rotation, partial obscuration of the photosphere by the
circumstellar disk, and flux from the bright inner disk.

which are allowed from neutrino oscillation as well as cosmology data when the
charged lepton mass matrix is assumed to take the diagonal form. In case of
one-zero texture, we write down the Majorana phases which are assumed to be
equal and the lightest neutrino mass as a function of the Dirac CP phase. In
case of two-zero texture, we numerically evaluate all the three CP phases and
lightest neutrino mass by solving four real constraint equations. We then
constrain texture zero mass matrices from the requirement of producing correct
baryon asymmetry through the mechanism of leptogenesis. Adopting a type I
seesaw framework, we consider the CP violating out of equilibrium decay of the
lightest right handed neutrino as the source of lepton asymmetry. Apart from
discriminating between the texture zero mass matrices and light neutrino mass
hierarchy, we also constrain the Dirac and Majorana CP phases so that the
observed baryon asymmetry can be produced. In two-zero texture, we further
constrain the diagonal form of Dirac neutrino mass matrix from the requirement
of producing correct baryon asymmetry.

provides the strongest principled justification yet of why we should expect
perfect transmission in such random media regardless of the refractive index

gravitational perturbations in both the even and odd parity sectors. In
particular, it was seen that the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations in $f(R)$
gravity obey the same equations as their General Relativity counterparts. More
recently, the 1+1+2 semi-tetrad formalism has been used to derive a set of two
wave equations: one for transverse, trace-free (tensor) perturbations and one
for the additional scalar modes that characterise fourth-order theories of
gravitation. The master variable governing tensor perturbations was shown to be
a modified Regge-Wheeler tensor obeying the same equation as in General
Relativity. However, it is well known that there is a non-uniqueness in the
definition of the master variable. In this paper we derive a set of two
perturbation variables and their concomitant wave equations that describe
gravitational perturbations in a covariant and gauge invariant manner. These
variables can be related to the Newman-Penrose (NP) Weyl scalars as well as the
master variables from the 2+2 formalism.

around the Coulomb barrier exhibit fusion hindrance, where the probability of
compound nucleus formation is strongly hindered compared with that in light-
and medium-mass systems. The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well
understood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion
dynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the
origin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy
dissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of
fusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation
term. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties
of the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted
potentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei
decreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of
the potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems
and from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients
show sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which
are rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these
properties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that
contribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger
than that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this
article. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we
conclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in
potential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the
dissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the
fusion hindrance.

these strongly confined materials. Here, by integrating chemically grown
monolayers of MoS2 with a silver-bowtie nanoantenna array supporting narrow
surface-lattice plasmonic resonances, a unique two-dimensional optical system
has been achieved. The enhanced exciton-plasmon coupling enables profound
changes in the emission and excitation processes leading to spectrally tunable,
large photoluminescence enhancement as well as surface-enhanced Raman
scattering at room temperature. Furthermore, at low temperatures, due to the
decreased damping of MoS2 excitons interacting with the plasmonic resonances of
the bowtie array, stronger exciton-plasmon coupling is achieved resulting in a
Fano lineshape in the reflection spectrum. The Fano lineshape, which is due to
the interference between the pathways involving the excitation of the exciton
and plasmon, can be tuned by altering the coupling strengths between the two
systems via changing the design of the bowties lattice. The ability to
manipulate the optical properties of two-dimensional systems with tunable
plasmonic resonators offers a new platform for the design of novel optical
devices with precisely tailored responses.

control vector fields that are compositions of Lipschitz maps with polynomials

revisit a long-known intuition about interference channels that as long as the
marginal distributions at the receivers are conserved, the capacity remains the
same. We take this intuition and impose a certain spatial correlation among
channel gains such that the marginal distributions remain unchanged. Then we
provide an outer-bound on the capacity region of the channel with correlation

eliminates the clean bulk, and reduces a $D$-dimensional problem to a

significantly bigger systems than is possible with exact diagonalization. We
use our method to analyze a 2D topological spin-Hall insulator with
non-magnetic and magnetic edge impurities, and we calculate the probability
density (or local density of states) of the zero-energy eigenstates as a

the system size needed to reach behavior in the thermodynamic limit increases

network, giving the connections between substrates and products. EFMs-based
metabolic flux analysis (MFA) estimates the flux over each EFM from external
flux measurements through least-squares data fitting. In previous work we
presented an optimization method of column generation type that facilitates
EFMs-based MFA when the metabolic reaction network is so large that enumerating
all EFMs is prohibitive. In this work we extend this model by including errors
on measurements in a robust optimization framework. In the robust optimization
problem, the least-squares data fitting is minimized subject to the error on
each metabolite being as unfavourable as it can be, within a given interval. In
general, inclusion of robustness may make the optimization problem
significantly harder. However, we show that in our case the robust problem can
be stated as a convex quadratic programming problem, i.e., of the same form as
the original non-robust problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
column-generation technique of the non-robust problem can be extended also to
the robust problem. Furthermore, the option to indicate intervals on
metabolites that are not measured is introduced in this column generation
framework. The effect of including robustness in the model is evaluated in a
case-study, which indicated that the solutions of our non-robust problems are
in fact near-optimal also when robustness is considered. On the other hand, the
addition of intervals on unmeasured metabolites resulted in a change of optimal
solution. Implying that the inclusion of intervals on unmeasured metabolites is
more important than the direct consideration of measurement errors, this
despite up to 20% errors.

curve in the plane, like a circle or a parabola. The ""zone"" of $C$ in $\mathcal
L$, denoted $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$, is defined as the set of all cells in
the arrangement $\mathcal A(\mathcal L)$ that are intersected by $C$.
Edelsbrunner et al. (1992) showed that the complexity (total number of edges or
vertices) of $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ is at most $O(n\alpha(n))$, where
$\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function. They did this by translating the
sequence of edges of $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ into a sequence $S$ that avoids
the subsequence $ababa$. Whether the worst-case complexity of $\mathcal
Z(C,\mathcal L)$ is only linear is a longstanding open problem.
  Since the relaxation of the problem to pseudolines does have a
$\Theta(n\alpha(n))$ bound, any proof of $O(n)$ for the case of straight lines
must necessarily use geometric arguments.
  In this paper we present some such geometric arguments. We show that, if $C$
is a circle, then certain configurations of straight-line segments with
endpoints on $C$ are impossible. In particular, we show that there exists a
Hart-Sharir sequence that cannot appear as a subsequence of $S$.
  The Hart-Sharir sequences are essentially the only known way to construct
$ababa$-free sequences of superlinear length. Hence, if it could be shown that
every family of $ababa$-free sequences of superlinear-length eventually
contains all Hart-Sharir sequences, it would follow that the complexity of
$\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ is $O(n)$ whenever $C$ is a circle.

adding plain data to the spreadsheet, an accountant may define new business

defined by adding intrusive ""code"" to the spreadsheet.
  In this paper we go through the design and implementation of an
aspect-oriented language for spreadsheets so that users can work on different
aspects of a spreadsheet in a modular way. For example, aspects can be defined
in order to introduce new business rules to an existing spreadsheet, or to
manipulate the spreadsheet data to be ported to another system. Aspects are
defined as aspect-oriented program specifications that are dynamically woven
into the underlying spreadsheet by an aspect weaver. In this aspect-oriented
style of spreadsheet development, different users develop, or reuse, aspects
without adding intrusive code to the original spreadsheet. Such code is
added/executed by the spreadsheet weaving mechanism proposed in this paper.

from incomplete measurements based on norm constraints on its image under a
linear operator (3) gambling on the value of the solution of the PDE based on a
hierarchy of nested measurements of its solution or source term. The resulting
elementary gambles form a hierarchy of (deterministic) basis functions of
$H^1_0(\Omega)$ (gamblets) that (1) are orthogonal across subscales/subbands
with respect to the scalar product induced by the energy norm of the PDE (2)
enable sparse compression of the solution space in $H^1_0(\Omega)$ (3) induce
an orthogonal multiresolution operator decomposition. The operating diagram of
the multigrid method is that of an inverted pyramid in which gamblets are
computed locally (by virtue of their exponential decay), hierarchically (from
fine to coarse scales) and the PDE is decomposed into a hierarchy of
independent linear systems with uniformly bounded condition numbers. The
resulting algorithm is parallelizable both in space (via localization) and in
bandwith/subscale (subscales can be computed independently from each other).
Although the method is deterministic it has a natural Bayesian interpretation
under the measure of probability emerging (as a mixed strategy) from the
information game formulation and multiresolution approximations form a
martingale with respect to the filtration induced by the hierarchy of nested

analysis of the three components of the massive multiple system $\delta$ Ori A,
focusing on the fundamental stellar properties, stellar winds, and X-ray
characteristics of the system. The primary's distance-independent parameters
turn out to be characteristic for its spectral type (O9.5 II), but usage of the
${\rm \it Hipparcos}$ parallax yields surprisingly low values for the mass,
radius, and luminosity. Consistent values follow only if $\delta$ Ori lies at
about twice the ${\rm \it Hipparcos}$ distance, in the vicinity of the
$\sigma$-Orionis cluster. The primary and tertiary dominate the spectrum and
leave the secondary only marginally detectable. We estimate the V-band
magnitude difference between primary and secondary to be $\Delta V \approx
2.\!\!^{\rm m}8$. The inferred parameters suggest the secondary is an early
B-type dwarf ($\approx$ B1 V), while the tertiary is an early B-type subgiant
($\approx$ B0 IV). We find evidence for rapid turbulent velocities ($\sim 200$
km ${\rm s}^{-1}$) and wind inhomogeneities, partially optically thick, in the
primary's wind. The bulk of the X-ray emission likely emerges from the
primary's stellar wind ($\log L_{\text{X}} / L_{\text{Bol}} \approx -6.85$),
initiating close to the stellar surface at $R_0 \sim 1.1\,R_*$. Accounting for
clumping, the mass-loss rate of the primary is found to be $\log \dot{M}
\approx -6.4\,[M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}]$, which agrees with hydrodynamic
predictions, and provides a consistent picture along the X-ray, UV, optical and

the distribution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the Lyman Alpha forest have
constrained the shape of the power spectrum of matter fluctuations on large
scales k < few h/Mpc. We explore a new technique to constrain the matter power
spectrum on smaller scales, assuming the dark matter is a Weakly Interacting
Massive Particle (WIMP) that annihilates at early epochs. Energy released by
dark matter annihilation can modify the spectrum of CMB temperature
fluctuations and thus CMB experiments such as Planck have been able to
constrain the quantity f <sigma v> /m < 1/88 picobarn c / GeV, where f is the
fraction of energy absorbed by gas, <sigma v> is the annihilation rate assumed
constant, and m is the particle mass. We assume the standard scale-invariant
primordial matter power spectrum of P_prim(k) ~ k^{n_s} at large scales k <
k_p, while we adopt the modified power law of P_prim(k) ~ k_p^{n_s}
(k/k_p)^{m_s} at small scales. We then aim at deriving constraints on m_s. For
m_s > n_s, the excess small-scale power results in a much larger number of
nonlinear small mass halos, particularly at high redshifts. Dark matter
annihilation in these halos releases sufficient energy to partially ionize the
gas, and consequently modify the spectrum of CMB fluctuations. We show that the
recent Planck data can already be used to constrain the power spectrum on small
scales. For a simple model with an NFW profile with halo concentration
parameter c_200 = 5 and f <sigma v> / m = 1/100 picobarn c / GeV, we can limit
the mass variance sigma_{max} < 100 at the 95% confidence level, corresponding
to a power law index m_s < 1.43 (1.63) for k_p = 100 (1000) h/Mpc. Our results

basis of the radio-gamma-ray connection established for the class of active
galactic nuclei known as blazars. In particular, the main spectral property of
the radio counterparts associated with gamma-ray blazars is that they show a
flat spectrum in the GHz frequency range. Our recent analysis dedicated to
search blazar-like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentified
gamma-ray sources (UGSs) allowed us to extend the radio-gamma-ray connection in
the MHz regime. We also showed that below 1 GHz blazars maintain flat radio
spectra. Thus on the basis of these new results, we assembled a low-frequency
radio catalog of flat spectrum sources built by combining the radio
observations of the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and of the
Westerbork in the southern hemisphere (WISH) catalog with those of the NRAO
Very Large Array Sky survey (NVSS). This could be used in the future to search

main properties of the catalog listing 28358 radio sources and their logN-logS
distributions. Finally a comparison with with the Green Bank 6-cm radio source

temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The state of matter at
such high densities and low temperatures is believed to be a phase known as the
color-flavor locked phase which breaks color and electromagnetic gauge
invariance leaving a linear combination of them unbroken. Of the 9 quarks
(three flavors and three colors), five are neutral under this unbroken
generator and four are oppositely charged. In the presence of a magnetic field
corresponding to the unbroken generator however, the properties of the
condensate changes and a new phase known as the magnetic color flavor locked
(MCFL)phase is realized. This phase breaks some of the color-flavor symmetry of
the Lagrangian spontaneously, giving rise to 6 Goldstone modes, 5 of which are
pseudo Goldstone modes. These Goldstone modes are composed of excitations that
correspond to both neutral quarks and charged quarks. Hence it is natural to
expect that the propagators of these Goldstone modes get affected in the
presence of a magnetic field and their speed becomes considerably anisotropic.
Although this anisotropy is self-evident from symmetry arguments, it has not
been quantified yet. We calculate this anisotropy in the speed of the Goldstone
modes using an NJL model type of interaction between the quarks and comment on
the impact of such anisotropic modes on the transport properties of the MCFL
phase.

N-body simulations with a homogeneous overdensity superimposed on a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Lema\^itre-Walker (FRLW) universe using the \emph{separate

spectrum response up to $n=3$, which is equivalent to measuring the fully
nonlinear matter $3-$ to $5-$point function in this squeezed limit. The
sub-percent to few percent accuracy of those measurements is unprecedented. We
then test the hypothesis that nonlinear $N$-point functions at a given time are
a function of the linear power spectrum at that time, which is predicted by
standard perturbation theory (SPT) and its variants that are based on the ideal
pressureless fluid equations. Specifically, we compare the responses computed

problems is by solving the expected residual minimization (ERM) problem. This
avenue necessitates distributional information associated with the uncertainty

distinctly different approach in the context of uncertain linear
complementarity problems with a view towards obtaining robust solutions.
Specifically, we define a robust solution to a complementarity problem as one
that minimizes the worst-case of the gap function. In what we believe is
amongst the first efforts to comprehensively address such problems in a
distribution-free environment, we show that under specified assumptions on the
uncertainty sets, the robust solutions to uncertain monotone linear

single convex program. We also define uncertainty sets that ensure that robust
solutions to non-monotone generalizations can also be obtained by solving
convex programs. More generally, robust counterparts of uncertain non-monotone
LCPs are proven to be low-dimensional nonconvex quadratically constrained
quadratic programs. We show that these problems may be globally resolved by
customizing an existing branching scheme. We further extend the tractability
results to include uncertain affine variational inequality problems defined
over uncertain polyhedral sets as well as to hierarchical regimes captured by
mathematical programs with uncertain complementarity constraints. Preliminary
numerics on uncertain linear complementarity and traffic equilibrium problems

space without altering topology. This paper introduces the notion simple set of
points of a digital space. The definition is based on contractible spaces and
contractible transformations. A set of points in a digital space is called
simple if it can be contracted to a point without changing topology of the
space. It is shown that contracting a simple set of points does not change the
homotopy type of a digital space, and the number of points in a digital space
without simple points can be reduces by contracting simple sets. Using the
process of contracting, we can substantially compress a digital space while

events. The climatic effects of the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events
were felt globally, although the North Atlantic experienced the largest and
most abrupt temperature anomalies. Similar but weaker oscillations also took
place during the interglacial period. This paper proposes an auto-oscillatory
mechanism between sea ice and convective deep water formation in the north
Atlantic as the source of the persistent cycles. A simple dynamical model is
constructed by coupling and slightly modifying two existing models of ocean
circulation and sea ice. The model exhibits mixed mode oscillations, consisting
of decadal scale small amplitude oscillations, and a large amplitude relaxation
fluctuation. The decadal oscillations occur due to the insulating effect of sea
ice and leads to periodic ventilation of heat from the polar ocean. Gradually
an instability builds up in the polar column and results in an abrupt
initiation of convection and polar warming. The unstable convective state
relaxes back to the small amplitude oscillations from where the process repeats
in a self-sustained manner. Freshwater pulses mimicking Heinrich events cause
the oscillations to be grouped into packets of progressively weaker
fluctuations, as also observed in the proxy records. Modulation of this stable
oscillation mechanism by freshwater and insolation variations could account for
the distribution and pacing of DO and Bond events. Physical aspects of the
system such as sea ice extent and oceanic advective flow rates could determine
the characteristic 1,500 year timescale of DO events.

the maximum number of orthogonal $\epsilon$-pseudoeigenfunctions with $\epsilon

a maximum of energy $\epsilon $ outside the domain $T\times \Omega $, in the

that systematic noise can be removed in Fourier space at all frequencies, by
only using data within a fixed time frame with a width equal to an integer
number of orbital periods. This results in a reconstruction of the full transit
signal which on average is unbiased, despite that no prior knowledge of either
the noise or the transit signal itself is used in the analysis. The method has
therefore clear advantages over standard phase folding, which normally requires
external input such as nearby stars or noise models for removing systematic

degrees) simultaneously, and \emph{Kepler} like data can be analyzed in just a

the intensity of all multiple large jumps. We find that the decay rates of
eigenfunctions depend on the process via specific preference rates in
particular jump scenarios, and depend on the potential through the distance of
the corresponding eigenvalue from the edge of the continuous spectrum. We prove
that the conditions of the jump-paring class imply that for all eigenvalues the
corresponding positive eigenfunctions decay at most as rapidly as the L\'evy
intensity. This condition is sharp in the sense that if the jump-paring
property fails to hold, then eigenfunction decay becomes slower than the decay
of the L\'evy intensity. We furthermore prove that under reasonable conditions
the L\'evy intensity also governs the upper bounds of eigenfunctions, and
ground states are comparable with it, i.e., two-sided bounds hold. As an
interesting consequence, we identify a sharp regime change in the decay of
eigenfunctions as the L\'evy intensity is varied from sub-exponential to
exponential order, and dependent on the location of the eigenvalue, in the
sense that through the transition L\'evy intensity-driven decay becomes slower
than the rate of decay of L\'evy intensity. Our approach is based on path
integration and probabilistic potential theory techniques, and all results are

drastically modified due to the unique geometry. We calculate the dc current
through a DRN in the Coulomb blockade regime and show that it can efficiently
work as a single electron transistor or a current rectifier. In both cases the
transport characteristics strongly depends on the details of the confinement
potential. The calculations are carried out for low and high bias regime, the
latter being especially interesting in the context of current rectification due
to fast relaxation processes.

decade scales superlinearly with word rank and exhibits a scaling break we
connect to that of Zipf's law. To better understand the changing lexicon, we
examine the contributions to the Jensen-Shannon divergence of individual words
crossing frequency thresholds. We also find indications that scholarly works

density to $\Omega_{c}h^2=0.1193\pm0.0014$, with an error of less than 1.5%. In
order to fully exploit this observational precision, theoretical calculations
should have a comparable or smaller error. In this paper we use recent lattice
QCD calculations to improve the description of the thermal plasma. This affects
the predicted relic density of ""thermal WIMPs"", which once were in chemical

extensively during navigation. We evaluated different types of image and video
frame descriptors that could be used to determine distinctive visual landmarks
for localizing a person based on what is seen by a camera that they carry. To
do this, we created a database containing over 3 km of video-sequences with
ground-truth in the form of distance travelled along different corridors. Using
this database, the accuracy of localization - both in terms of knowing which
route a user is on - and in terms of position along a certain route, can be
evaluated. For each type of descriptor, we also tested different techniques to
encode visual structure and to search between journeys to estimate a user's
position. The techniques include single-frame descriptors, those using
sequences of frames, and both colour and achromatic descriptors. We found that
single-frame indexing worked better within this particular dataset. This might
be because the motion of the person holding the camera makes the video too
dependent on individual steps and motions of one particular journey. Our
results suggest that appearance-based information could be an additional source
of navigational data indoors, augmenting that provided by, say, radio signal
strength indicators (RSSIs). Such visual information could be collected by
crowdsourcing low-resolution video feeds, allowing journeys made by different
users to be associated with each other, and location to be inferred without
requiring explicit mapping. This offers a complementary approach to methods
based on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms.

the number of factors for a given data set. The scree test is popular but
subjective. The best performing objective methods are recommended on the basis
of simulations. We introduce a method based on bi-cross-validation, using
randomly held-out submatrices of the data to choose the number of factors. We
find it performs better than the leading methods of parallel analysis (PA) and
Kaiser's rule. Our performance criterion is based on recovery of the underlying
factor-loading (signal) matrix rather than identifying the true number of
factors. Like previous comparisons, our work is simulation based. Recent
advances in random matrix theory provide principled choices for the number of
factors when the noise is homoscedastic, but not for the heteroscedastic case.
The simulations we choose are designed using guidance from random matrix
theory. In particular, we include factors too small to detect, factors large
enough to detect but not large enough to improve the estimate, and two classes
of factors large enough to be useful. Much of the advantage of
bi-cross-validation comes from cases with factors large enough to detect but
too small to be well estimated. We also find that a form of early stopping

derived planetary radii for the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). The current
production of the KOI list assumes that the each KOI is a single star. Not
accounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets towards
smaller radii. The bias towards smaller radii depends on the properties of the
companion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companion
stars. Defining a planetary radius correction factor $X_R$, we find that if the
KOIs are assumed to be single, then, {\it on average}, the planetary radii may
be underestimated by a factor of $\langle X_R \rangle \approx 1.5$. If typical
radial velocity and high resolution imaging observations are performed and no
companions are detected, this factor reduces to $\langle X_R \rangle \approx
1.2$. The correction factor $\langle X_R \rangle$ is dependent upon the primary
star properties and ranges from $\langle X_R \rangle \approx 1.6$ for A and F
stars to $\langle X_R \rangle \approx 1.2$ for K and M stars. For missions like
K2 and TESS where the stars may be closer than the stars in the Kepler target
sample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the radius correction
factor to $\langle X_R \rangle \approx 1.1$. Finally, we show that if the
stellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, occurrence rate
calculations for Earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of small

next-generation magnetic storage due to their nanoscale domains to enable high
information storage density and their low threshold for current-driven motion
to enable ultralow energy consumption. One-dimensional (1D) nanowires are ideal
hosts for skyrmions since they not only serve as a natural platform for
magnetic racetrack memory devices but also can potentially stabilize skyrmions.
Here we use the topological Hall effect (THE) to study the phase stability and
current-driven dynamics of the skyrmions in MnSi nanowires. The THE was
observed in an extended magnetic field-temperature window (15 to 30 K),
suggesting stabilization of skyrmion phase in nanowires compared with the bulk
(27 to 29.5 K). Furthermore, for the first time, we study skyrmion dynamics in
this extended skyrmion phase region and found that under the high
current-density of $10^{8}-10^{9} Am^{-2}$ enabled by nanowire geometry, the
THE decreases with increasing current densities, which demonstrates the
current-driven motion of skyrmions generating the emergent electric field.
These results open up the exploration of nanowires as an attractive platform
for investigating skyrmion physics in 1D systems and exploiting skyrmions in
magnetic storage concepts.

important when the objective is to produce estimates for a large number of time
series. In this context, the Theta method called researchers attention due its
performance in the largest up-to-date forecasting competition, the
M3-Competition. Theta method proposes the decomposition of the deseasonalised
data into two ""theta lines"". The first theta line removes completely the
curvatures of the data, thus being a good estimator of the long-term trend
component. The second theta line doubles the curvatures of the series, as to
better approximate the short-term behaviour. In this paper, we propose a
generalisation of the Theta method by optimising the selection of the second
theta line, based on various validation schemes where the out-of-sample
accuracy of the candidate variants is measured. The recomposition process of
the original time series builds on the asymmetry of the decomposed theta lines.
An empirical investigation through the M3-Competition data set shows
improvements on the forecasting accuracy of the proposed optimised Theta
method.

illustrate our ideas using a family of bio-motivated spreading models
originally proposed in the epidemiological literature, e.g., the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. We first introduce a framework in
which we are allowed to distribute two types of resources in order to contain
the spread, namely, (i) preventive resources able to reduce the spreading rate,
and (ii) corrective resources able to increase the recovery rate of nodes in
which the resources are allocated. In practice, these resources have an
associated cost that depends on either the resiliency level achieved by the
preventive resource, or the restoration efficiency of the corrective resource.
We present a mathematical framework, based on dynamic systems theory and convex
optimization, to find the cost-optimal distribution of protection resources in
a network to contain the spread. We also present two extensions to this
framework in which (i) we consider generalized epidemic models, beyond the
simple SIS model, and (ii) we assume uncertainties in the contact network in
which the spreading is taking place. We compare these protection strategies
with common heuristics previously proposed in the literature and illustrate our
results with numerical simulations using the air traffic network.

mole fractions of H2O between -3.09 and -3.91, CO between -3.30 and -3.72 and
CH4 between -5.06 and -5.85. More precise mole fractions are obtained for each

shown to be sensitive to vertical mixing and indicates an eddy diffusion
coefficient in the range of 10^6 to 10^8 cm^2 s^-1, comparable to mixing in the

yielded better intrinsic spatial resolution (~540 {\mu}m) and lower light
output than rough crystal. Energy resolutions of I-125 and Tc-99m were ~36.9%

that main stock markets such as the US markets and most European markets do not
set price limits. Here, we perform detailed analyses of the high-frequency data
of all A-share common stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2011 to investigate the statistical
properties of price limit hits and the dynamical evolution of several important
financial variables before stock price hits its limits. We compare the
properties of up-limit hits and down-limit hits. We also divide the whole
period into three bullish periods and three bearish periods to unveil possible
differences during bullish and bearish market states. To uncover the impacts of
stock capitalization on price limit hits, we partition all stocks into six
portfolios according to their capitalizations on different trading days. We
find that the price limit trading rule has a cooling-off effect (object to the
magnet effect), indicating that the rule takes effect in the Chinese stock
markets. We find that price continuation is much more likely to occur than
price reversal on the next trading day after a limit-hitting day, especially
for down-limit hits, which has potential practical values for market
practitioners.

each root of unity $\xi$ (with some mild restriction on the order) one can
define the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) quantum invariant $\tau_M^{\mathfrak
g}(\xi)\in \mathbb C$ of oriented 3-manifolds $M$. In the present paper we
construct an invariant $J_M$ of integral homology spheres $M$ with values in
the cyclotomic completion $\widehat {\mathbb Z [q]}$ of the polynomial ring
$\mathbb Z [q]$, such that the evaluation of $J_M$ at each root of unity gives
the WRT quantum invariant of $M$ at that root of unity. This result generalizes
the case ${\mathfrak g}=sl_2$ proved by the first author. It follows that $J_M$
unifies all the quantum invariants of $M$ associated with $\mathfrak g$, and
represents the quantum invariants as a kind of ""analytic function"" defined on
the set of roots of unity. For example, $\tau_M(\xi)$ for all roots of unity
are determined by a ""Taylor expansion"" at any root of unity, and also by the
values at infinitely many roots of unity of prime power orders. It follows that
WRT quantum invariants $\tau_M(\xi)$ for all roots of unity are determined by
the Ohtsuki series, which can be regarded as the Taylor expansion at $q=1$, and
hence by the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant. Another consequence is that the WRT
quantum invariants $\tau_M^{ \mathfrak g}(\xi)$ are algebraic integers. The
construction of the invariant $J_M$ is done on the level of quantum group, and
does not involve any finite dimensional representation, unlike the definition
of the WRT quantum invariant. Thus, our construction gives a unified,
""representation-free"" definition of the quantum invariants of integral homology
spheres.

matches the species tree, showing that this number grows with $m!!$ in the
number of taxa $m$. This computation demonstrates the existence of tree
families in which the growth in the number of coalescent histories is faster
than exponential. Further, it provides a substantial improvement on the lower
bound for the ratio of the largest number of matching coalescent histories to
the smallest number of matching coalescent histories for trees with $m$ taxa,

optimized individually and plans in the second set shared the 30 degree

2-dimensional ion chamber array MatriXX (IBA Dosimetry, Germany). The
comparison between the calculation and measurements were made by the
$\gamma$-index analysis. The $\gamma$-index (2\%/2 mm) and (3\%/3 mm) passing

between $\gamma$-index (3\%/3 mm) passing rates of different collimator angles

were significant differences (maximum 5.6\%) in the passing rates of different

According to these explicit expressions we demonstrate strictly that the large
Q-balls enlarge and the small ones become smaller in the background with lower
temperature. The energy per unit charge will not be divergent if the charge is
enormous. We find that the lower temperature will lead the energy per unit
charge of Q-ball smaller. We also prove rigorously the necessary conditions

When one of model parameters of Q-balls $K$ is positive, the Q-balls will not

D2D groups. We formulate the problem of power and channel allocation as a mixed
integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem where one D2D group can reuse the
channels of multiple CUs and the channel of each CU can be reused by multiple
D2D groups. Distinct from existing approaches in the literature, our
formulation and solution methods provide an effective and flexible means to
utilize radio resources in cellular networks and share them with multicast
groups without causing harmful interference to each other. A variant of the
generalized bender decomposition (GBD) is applied to optimally solve the MINLP

devised. The performance of all schemes is evaluated through extensive
simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed greedy algorithm
can achieve closeto- optimal performance, and the heuristic algorithm provides
good performance, though inferior than that of the greedy, with much lower

entanglement to be sustained at high temperatures for quantum systems in
thermal equilibrium (Case A), in nonequilibrium (Case B) and in nonequilibrium
steady state conditions (Case C). The system we analyze here consists of two
coupled quantum harmonic oscillators each interacting with its own bath
described by a scalar field, set at temperatures $T_1 > T_2$. For
\textit{constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling} studied here (Case C1)
owing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be solved exactly at arbitrary
temperatures even for strong coupling. We find that the valid entanglement
criterion in general is not a function of the bath temperature difference, in
contrast to thermal transport in the same NESS setting [1]. Thus lowering the
temperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard
the entanglement between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will
disappear if any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the
critical temperature $T_c$. With the Langevin equations derived we give a full
display of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$
, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For
weak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature $T_c$ is about the order
of the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it
will depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic
circumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling,
`hot entanglement' is largely a fiction. In Paper III we will examine the case
(C2) of \textit{time-dependent driven coupling } which contains the parametric
pumping type described in [2] wherein entanglement was first shown to sustain
at high temperatures.

have been observed in the past in systems with multi-peaked thermicity, using
Fickett's detonation analogue. A steady state analysis of the travelling wave
predicts multiple states, however, all but the one with the highest velocity
develop a singularity after the sonic point. Simulations show singularities are
associated with a shock wave which overtakes all sonic points, establishing a
detonation travelling at the highest of the predicted velocities.
  Under a certain parameter range, the steady-state detonation can have
multiple sonic points and solutions. Embedded shocks can exist behind sonic
points, where they link the weak and strong solutions. Sonic points whose
characteristics do not diverge are found to be unstable, and to be the source
of the embedded shocks. Numerical simulations show that these shocks are only
quasi-stable. This is believed to be due in part to a feature of the model
which permits shocks anywhere behind a sonic point.

irradiation doses can alter the structure and function of macromolecules,

effects of e-beam irradiation on the medical grade thermo plastic polyurethane
were studied. The changes in the chain length and their distribution as well as
the changes in molecular structure were studied. The GPC (Gel Permeation
Chromatography) results show that the oxidative decomposition is followed by a
decrease in molecular mass together with an increase in polydispersity. This
indicates a very inhomogeneous degradation, which is a consequence of the
specific course and of the intensity of oxidative degradation. This was
confirmed by means of mechanical property measurements. Overall, this study
demonstrated that the medical grade TPU was affected by radiation exposure,

magnetic Ru$^{3+}$ ions with the $4d^5$ electronic state. We have investigated
the magnetic properties of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ via magnetization and specific
heat measurements using single crystals. It was observed that $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
undergoes a structural phase transition at $T_{t}\,{\simeq}\,150$ K accompanied
by fairly large hysteresis. This structural phase transition is expected to be
similar to that observed in closely related CrCl$_3$. The magnetizations and
magnetic susceptibilities are strongly anisotropic, which mainly arise from the
anisotropic $g$-factors, i.e., $g_{ab}\,{\simeq}\,2.5$ and $g_c\,{\simeq}\,0.4$
for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the $ab$ plane, respectively.
These $g$-factors and the obtained entropy indicate that the effective spin of
Ru$^{3+}$ is one-half, which results from the low-spin state. Specific heat
data show that magnetic ordering occurs in four steps at zero magnetic field.
The successive magnetic phase transitions should be ascribed to the competition
among exchange interactions. The magnetic phase diagram for
$H\,{\parallel}\,ab$ is obtained. We discuss the strongly anisotropic
$g$-factors in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and deduce that the exchange interaction is
strongly XY-like. $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is magnetically described as a

formation and rupture of conducting filaments, believed to be mediated by
oxygen-vacancy redistribution. The underlying atomic-scale processes are still
unknown, however, which limits device modeling and design. Here we combine
experimental data with multi-scale calculations to elucidate the entire
atomic-scale cycle in undoped polycrystalline BiFeO3. Conductive atomic force
microscopy reveals that the grain boundaries behave like two-dimensional
nanovaristors while, on the return part of the cycle, the decreasing current is
through the grains. Using density-functional-theory and Monte-Carlo
calculations we deduce the atomic-scale mechanism of the observed phenomena.
Oxygen vacancies in non-equilibrium concentrations are initially distributed
relatively uniformly, but they are swept into the grain boundaries by an
increasing voltage. A critical voltage, the SET voltage, then eliminates the
barrier for hopping conduction through vacancy energy levels in grain
boundaries. On the return part of the cycle, the grain boundaries are again
non-conductive, but the grains show nonzero conductivity by virtue of remote
doping by oxygen vacancies. The RESET voltage amounts to a heat pulse that
redistributes the vacancies. The realization that nanovaristors are at the
heart of memristive switching in polycrystalline materials may open
possibilities for novel devices and circuits.

number $t$ of defective items that are present among a large number $N$ of
items. Each test takes as input a group of items and produces a binary output
indicating whether any defective item is present in the group. In a
non-adaptive scheme designing a testing scheme is equivalent to the
construction of a disjunct matrix, an $M \times N$ binary matrix where the
union of supports of any $t$ columns does not contain the support of any other
column. In this paper we consider the scenario where defective items are random
and follow simple probability distributions. In particular we consider the
cases where 1) each item can be defective independently with probability
$\frac{t}{N}$ and 2) each $t$-set of items can be defective with uniform
probability. In both cases our aim is to design a testing matrix that
successfully identifies the set of defectives with high probability. Both of
these models have been studied in the literature before and it is known that
$O(t\log N)$ tests are necessary as well as sufficient (via random coding) in
both cases. Our main focus is explicit deterministic construction of the test
matrices amenable to above scenarios. One of the most popular ways of
constructing test matrices relies on \emph{constant-weight error-correcting
codes} and their minimum distance. We go beyond the minimum distance analysis
and connect the average distance of a constant weight code to the parameters of
the resulting test matrix. With our relaxed requirements, we show that using
explicit constant-weight codes (e.g., based on algebraic geometry codes) we may
achieve a number of tests equal to $O(t \frac{\log^2 N}{ \log t})$ for both the

sparsity simultaneously. It is well known that regularization parameter (REPA)
selection of SLMS-RL1 is a very challenging issue. In the worst case,
inappropriate REPA may even result in unexpected instable convergence of
SLMS-RL1 algorithm. In this paper, Monte Carlo based selection method is
proposed to select suitable REPA so that SLMS-RL1 can achieve two goals: stable
convergence as well as usage sparsity information. Simulation results are
provided to corroborate our studies.

narrow lines, due to the changing observing conditions. Six of the newly
detected lags are indistinguishable from the Hbeta lags measured in the same
sources. Two are significantly longer and one is slightly shorter. Combining
with Fe II lags reported in previous studies, we find a Fe II
radius--luminosity relationship similar to the one for Hbeta, although our

Fe II emission lines originate in photoionized gas which, for the majority of
the newly reported objects, is indistinguishable from the Hbeta-emitting gas.

Iref with axial movement of deformation point and Vref depending on the types
of deformation that are the deformation1 is to increase the Vref (relaxation)

(Vdef) acquired by ImSimQA software were inversely deformed to Iref and Vref
using DIR algorithms. As a result, we acquired deformed image (Iid) from Idef
and volume (Vid) from Vdef. The DIR algorithms were the Horn Schunk optical
flow (HS), Iterative Optical Flow (IOF), Modified Demons (MD) and Fast Demons
(FD) with the Deformable Image Registration and Adaptive Radiotherapy Toolkit
(DIRART) of MATLAB. The image similarity between Iref and Iid was calculated
using the metrics that were Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Normalized
Cross Correlation (NCC). When moving distance of deformation point was 4 mm,
the value of NMI was above 1.81 and NCC was above 0.99 in all DIR
algorithms.When the Vref increased or decreased about 12%, the difference
between Vref and Vid was within 5% regardless of the type of deformation.The
value of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was above 0.95 in deformation1
except for the MD algorithm. In case of deformation 2, that of DSC was above
0.95 in all DIR algorithms. The Idef and Vdef have not been completely restored
to Iref and Vref and the accuracy of DIR algorithms was different depending on
the degree of deformation. Hence, the performance of DIR algorithms should be
verified for the desired applications.

eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-duration
class. Dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the Milky Way and
the two Magellanic Clouds. We derive the rest-frame extinction of the entire
sample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it A}_{\rm V} \lesssim 1.2$.
Moreover, the SMC extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve template
for the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with those
commonly observed in GRB lines-of-sights. In one analysed case (GRB 120119A),
the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observed
extinction. To illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality X-shooter
afterglow SEDs over the photometric SEDs, we repeat the modeling using the
broadband SEDs with the NIR-to-UV photometric measurements instead of the
spectra. The main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to a
combination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the SED,
are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore the
dust properties in GRB hosts with respect to photometric measurements. In all
cases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over the
others. We show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectral
slope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric SED analysis, can differ
significantly for individual events. Finally we stress that, regardless of the
resolution of the optical-to-NIR data, the SED modeling gives reliable results
only when the fit is performed on a SED covering a broader spectral region.

curvature formula from integral geometry to reweight the sampling probabilities
of Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithms in order to increase their convergence
speed. We consider algorithms that sample from a probability density
conditioned on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Our method exploits the symmetries of
the algorithms' isotropic random search-direction subspaces to analytically
average out the variance in the intersection volume caused by the orientation
of the search-subspace with respect to the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ it
intersects. This variance can grow exponentially with the dimension of the
search-subspace, greatly slowing down the algorithm. Eliminating this variance
allows us to use search-subspaces of dimensions many times greater than would
otherwise be possible, allowing us to sample very rare events that a
lower-dimensional search-subspace would be unlikely to intersect.
  To extend this method to events that are rare for reasons other than their
support $\mathcal{M}$ having a lower dimension, we formulate and prove a new
theorem in integral geometry that makes use of the curvature form of the
Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem to reweight sampling probabilities. On the side, we
also apply our theorem to obtain new theoretical bounds for the volumes of real
algebraic manifolds.

super-resolution based on an observation: an image is consisted of smooth
components and non-smooth components, and we use two classes of approximated
Heaviside functions (AHFs) to represent them respectively. Due to sparsity of
the non-smooth components, a $L_{1}$ model is employed. In addition, we apply
the proposed iterative model to image patches to reduce computation and

that the amplitude and distribution of these fluctuations are insensitive to

the link in WMN. A major challenge in a MCMR-WMN is finding the routing with
QoS satisfied and an interference free path from the redundant paths, in order
to transmit the packets through this path. The Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) is an optimization technique to find the candidate solution in the search
space optimally, and it applies artificial intelligence to solve the routing
problem. On the other hand, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population based
meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the natural evolution, such
as selection,mutation and crossover. PSO can easily fall into a local optimal
solution, at the same time GA is not suitable for dynamic data due to the
underlying dynamic network. In this paper we propose an optimal intelligent
routing, using a Hybrid PSO-GA, which also meets the QoS constraints. Moreover,
it integrates the strength of PSO and GA. The QoS constraints, such as
bandwidth, delay, jitter and interference are transformed into penalty
functions. The simulation results show that the hybrid approach outperforms PSO

modern computer systems. However, current database management systems (DBMSs)
are generally ineffective in exploiting the parallelism of such systems. In
particular, contention can lead to a dramatic fall in performance. In this
paper, we propose a new concurrency control protocol called DGCC (Dependency
Graph based Concurrency Control) that separates concurrency control from
execution. DGCC builds dependency graphs for batched transactions before
executing them. Using these graphs, contentions within the same batch of
transactions are resolved before execution. As a result, the execution of the
transactions does not need to deal with contention while maintaining full
equivalence to that of serialized execution. This better exploits multicore
hardware and achieves higher level of parallelism. To facilitate DGCC, we have
also proposed a system architecture that does not have certain centralized
control components yielding better scalability, as well as supports a more
efficient recovery mechanism. Our extensive experimental study shows that DGCC
achieves up to four times higher throughput compared to that of
state-of-the-art concurrency control protocols for high contention workloads.

  The admissible polyhedral scatterers satisfy minimal a priori assumptions of
Lipschitz type and may include at the same time solid obstacles and screen-type

explicit dependence on the parameter $h$ representing the minimal size of the
cells forming the boundaries of the admissible polyhedral scatterers, and that
the modulus of continuity, provided the error is small enough with respect to
$h$, does not depend on $h$. If we restrict to $N=2,3$ and to polyhedral
obstacles, that is to polyhedra, then we obtain stability estimates with fewer

electron transport through a quantum-dot spin valve. The hyperfine interaction
between electron and nuclear spins in a quantum dot allows for the transfer of
angular momentum from spin-polarized electrons injected from ferromagnetic or
half-metal leads to the nuclear spin system under a finite voltage bias.
Accounting for a local nuclear-spin dephasing process prevents the system from
becoming stuck in collective dark states, allowing a large nuclear polarization
to be built up in the long-time limit. After reaching a steady state, reversing
the voltage bias induces a transient current response as the nuclear
polarization is reversed. Long-range nuclear-spin coherence leads to a strong
enhancement of spin-flip transition rates (by an amount proportional to the
number of nuclear spins) and is revealed by an intense current burst, analogous
to superradiant light emission. The crossover to a regime with incoherent spin
flips occurs on a relatively long time scale, on the order of the
single-nuclear-spin dephasing time, which can be much longer than the time
scale for the superradiant current burst. This conclusion is confirmed through
a general master equation. For the two limiting regimes (coherent/incoherent
spin flips) the general master equation recovers our simpler treatment based on
rate equations, but is also applicable at intermediate dephasing. Throughout
this work we assume uniform hyperfine couplings, which yield the strongest
coherent enhancement. We propose realistic strategies, based on isotopic
modulation and wavefunction engineering in core-shell nanowires, to realize
this analytically solvable ""box-model"" of hyperfine couplings.

offer a plethora of routes towards the realization of exotic phases of matter.
In these systems, inversion symmetry is broken which strongly affects the
properties of possible instabilities -- in particular in the superconducting
channel. By combining symmetry and energetic arguments, we derive general and
experimentally accessible selection rules for Cooper instabilities in
noncentrosymmetric systems which yield necessary and sufficient conditions for
spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking at the superconducting transition
and constrain the orientation of the triplet vector. We discuss in detail the
implications for various different materials. For instance, we conclude that
the pairing state in thin layers of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ must, as opposed to its bulk
superconducting state, preserve time-reversal symmetry with its triplet vector
being parallel to the plane of the system. All pairing states of this system
allowed by the selection rules are predicted to display topological Majorana
modes at dislocations or at the edge of the system. Applying our results to the
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures, we find that while the condensates of the
(001) and (110) oriented interfaces must be time-reversal symmetric,
spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking can only occur for the less studied
(111) interface. We also discuss the consequences for thin layers of
URu$_2$Si$_2$ and UPt$_3$ as well as for single-layer FeSe. On a more general
level, our considerations might serve as a design principle in the search for
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity in the absence of external
magnetic fields.

electric field, E_ext, applied normal to a 2D black phosphorus thin film, can
reduce the direct band gap of few-layer black phosphorus, resulting in an
insulator-to-metal transition at a critical field, E_c. Increasing E_ext beyond
E_c can induce a Dirac cone in the system, provided the black phosphorus film
is sufficiently thin. The electric field strength can tune the position of the
Dirac cone and the Dirac-Fermi velocities, the latter being similar in
magnitude to that in graphene. We show that the Dirac cone arises from an
anisotropic interaction term between the frontier orbitals that are spatially
separated due to the applied field, on different halves of the 2D slab. When
this interaction term becomes vanishingly small for thicker films, the Dirac
cone can no longer be induced. Spin-orbit coupling can gap out the Dirac cone
at certain electric fields; however, a further increase in field strength
reduces the spin-orbit-induced gap, eventually resulting in a
topological-insulator-to-Dirac-semi-metal transition.

  Item Recommendation","10 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.IR cs.DB cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), spatial
item recommendation has become an important means to help people discover
attractive and interesting venues and events, especially when users travel out
of town. However, this recommendation is very challenging compared to the
traditional recommender systems. A user can visit only a limited number of
spatial items, leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. Most of the items
visited by a user are located within a short distance from where he/she lives,
which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far away
place. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically
across different geographical regions. In light of this, we propose Geo-SAGE, a
geographical sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation
in this paper. Geo-SAGE considers both user personal interests and the
preference of the crowd in the target region, by exploiting both the
co-occurrence pattern of spatial items and the content of spatial items. To
further alleviate the data sparsity issue, Geo-SAGE exploits the geographical
correlation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial
index structure called spatial pyramid. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate the performance of our Geo-SAGE model on two real large-scale
datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate our Geo-SAGE model
outperforms the state-of-the-art in the two tasks of both out-of-town and
home-town recommendations.

by time modulation of the Rashba coupling $\alpha_R$, which induces an
additional electric field $E^R_d={\dot \alpha_R} m_e/e\hbar({\hat z}\times
{\mathbf m})$. When the modulation frequency is higher than the magnetization
precessing frequency, the amplitude of this field is significantly larger than
previously predicted results. Correspondingly, the spin torque on the
magnetization is also effectively enhanced. Additionally, the nature of SOC
induced spin torque in the system can be transformed from damping to
antidamping-like by modulating ${\dot \alpha_R}$. We also suggest a biasing
scheme to achieve rectification of SMF, {\it i.e.}, by application of a square
wave voltage at the resonant frequency. Finally, we numerically estimate the
resulting spin torque field arising from a Gaussian pulse time modulation of
$\alpha_R$.

traditional data log (e.g., ARIES log) in the in-memory databases. Instead of
recording how the tuples are updated, a command log only tracks the
transactions being executed, thereby effectively reducing the size of the log
and improving the performance. Command logging on the other hand increases the
cost of recovery, because all the transactions in the log after the last
checkpoint must be completely redone in case of a failure. In this paper, we
first extend the command logging technique to a distributed environment, where
all the nodes can perform recovery in parallel. We then propose an adaptive
logging approach by combining data logging and command logging. The percentage
of data logging versus command logging becomes an optimization between the
performance of transaction processing and recovery to suit different OLTP
applications. Our experimental study compares the performance of our proposed
adaptive logging, ARIES-style data logging and command logging on top of
H-Store. The results show that adaptive logging can achieve a 10x boost for
recovery and a transaction throughput that is comparable to that of command
logging.

a scalar field as dark energy is studied up to the third derivative
($d^3w/da^3$) with respect to the scale factor $a$, in order to predict the
future observations and specify the scalar potential parameters with the
observables. The third derivative of $w$ for general potential $V$ is derived
and applied to several types of potentials. They are the inverse power-law
($V=M^{4+\alpha}/Q^{\alpha}$), the exponential ($V=M^4\exp{(\beta M/Q)}$), the
mixed ( $V=M^{4+\gamma}\exp{(\beta M/Q)}/Q^{\gamma}$), the cosine ($V=M^4(\cos
(Q/f)+1)$) and the Gaussian types ($V=M^4\exp(-Q^2/\sigma^2)$), which are
prototypical potentials for the freezing and thawing models.
  If the parameter number for a potential form is $ n$, it is necessary to find
at least for $n+2$ independent observations to identify the potential form and
the evolution of the scalar field ($Q$ and $ \dot{Q} $).
  Such observations would be the values of $ \Omega_Q, w, dw/da. \cdots $, and
$ dw^n/da^n$.
  From these specific potentials, we can predict the $ n+1 $ and higher
derivative of $w$ ; $ dw^{n+1}/da^{n+1}, \cdots$.
  Since four of the above mentioned potentials have two parameters, it is
necessary to calculate the third derivative of $w$ for them to estimate the
predict values.
  If they are tested observationally, it will be understood whether the dark
energy could be described by the scalar field with this potential.
  At least it will satisfy the necessary conditions.
  Numerical analysis for $d^3w/da^3$ are made under some specified parameters

The widths of these correlation functions are called HBT radii, named after
Brown and Twiss who studied the angular diameter of stars via intensity
correlations in their radio telescopes. Today, high energy physics experiments
measure the HBT radii as a function of many parameters: particle type,
transverse momentum, azimuthal angle, collision energy, collision geometry. In

the observation of strong azimuthal-angle dependence of the extracted Gaussian
HBT radii, the similarities and differences between kaon and pion HBT radii.
The key point of this paper is the application of Bose-Einstein correlations to
the search for the critical point: how HBT radii would show the appearance of a
first order phase transition, and what the non-monotonic collision energy
dependence of the pion source tells us about the critical point; and how the

the properties of the total matter (both luminous and dark). For comparison
with observations, it is better to consider tracer populations of stars. These
can be used to represent elliptical galaxies or the spheroidal components of
spiral galaxies. Accordingly, we study the properties of tracers with power-law
or Einasto profiles moving in the doubloon potential. Under the assumption of
spherical alignment, we provide a simple way to solve the Jeans equations for
the velocity dispersions. This choice of alignment is supported by observations
on the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Power-law tracers have prolate spheroidal
velocity ellipsoids everywhere. However, this is not the case for Einasto
tracers, for which the velocity ellipsoids change from prolate to oblate
spheroidal near the pole. Asymptotic forms of the velocity distributions close
to the escape speed are also derived, with an eye to application to the high
velocity stars in the Milky Way. Power-law tracers have power-law or Maxwellian
velocity distributions tails, whereas Einasto tracers have super-exponential
cut-offs.

in energy and intersect the Landau levels of the hole-like subbands. The
electron-hole hybridization leads to a series of anti-crossing splittings of
the Landau levels. The energies of some Landau level transitions and their
corresponding transition strengthes are calculated. The magnetic field
dependence of some dominant transitions is shown with their corresponding
initial-states and final-states indicated. This information should be useful in
analyzing an experimentally measured magneto-optical spectrum. At high magnetic
fields, multiple transitions due to the initial-state splitting can be
observed. The dominant transitions at high fields can be roughly viewed as two
spin-split Landau level transitions with many electron-hole hybridization
induced splittings. The energy separations between the dominant transitions may
decrease or increase versus the magnetic field locally, or may be almost field
independent. The separations can be tuned by changing the width of InAs layer

suggests existence of two parallel conduction channels: metallic and
semiconducting, with the latter making negligible contribution at low

linear magnetoresistance is observed up to room temperature. Below 10 K, it is

and interstellar environments, raising the question of their formation pathway.
It has been proposed that they can form by the photo-chemical processing of
large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Following our previous work on
the evolution of PAHs in the NGC 7023 reflection nebula, we evaluate, using
photochemical modeling, the possibility that the PAH C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ (i.e.
circumovalene) can lead to the formation of C$_{60}$ upon irradiation by
ultraviolet photons. The chemical pathway involves full dehydrogenation,
folding into a floppy closed cage and shrinking of the cage by loss of C$_2$
units until it reaches the symmetric C$_{60}$ molecule. At 10"" from the
illuminating star and with realistic molecular parameters, the model predicts
that 100% of C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ is converted into C$_{60}$ in $\sim$ 10$^5$
years, a timescale comparable to the age of the nebula. Shrinking appears to be
the kinetically limiting step of the whole process. Hence, PAHs larger than
C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ are unlikely to contribute significantly to the formation of
C$_{60}$, while PAHs containing between 60 and 66 C atoms should contribute to
the formation of C$_{60}$ with shorter timescales, and PAHs containing less
than 60 C atoms will be destroyed. Assuming a classical size distribution for
the PAH precursors, our model predicts absolute abundances of C$_{60}$ are up
to several $10^{-4}$ of the elemental carbon, i.e. less than a percent of the
typical interstellar PAH abundance, which is consistent with observational
studies. According to our model, once formed, C$_{60}$ can survive much longer
than other fullerenes because of the remarkable stability of the C$_{60}$
molecule at high internal energies.Hence, a natural consequence is that
C$_{60}$ is more abundant than other fullerenes in highly irradiated
environments.

image quality measured CT transverse images of the PMMA head phantom depending

transverse images were chosen from the right and left areas under the surface
of the PMMA head phantom and from ion chamber holes located at directions of 12

showed that the new DRFS shields could reduce dosages to 15.61%, 23.05%, and
22.71% more in 90 kVp, 120 kVp, and 140 kVp, respectively, than with a

convergence regime, which we characterize precisely in terms of the structure
of the underlying active manifolds. For simpler problems involving polyhedral

results may have numerous applications including in signal/image processing,

prediction is based on an ""internally-consistent"" scheme to adjust the exchange
mixing parameter $\alpha$ of the PBEh hybrid density functional, so as to
obtain a description of the electronic structure consistent with the

fluctuations, in both studies [5,9] an artificial harmonic potential was added
to the action; in [9] measurements were taken after a fixed number of accepted
instead of attempted moves which introduces an additional error. Finally the
simulations suffer from strong critical slowing down which may have been
underestimated. In the present work, we address the above weaknesses: we allow
the volume to fluctuate freely within a fixed interval; we take measurements

by using an optimized parallel tempering algorithm [12]. With these improved
methods, on systems of size up to 64k 4-simplices, we confirm that the phase
transition is first order.
  In addition, we discuss a local criterion to decide whether parts of a
triangulation are in the elongated or crumpled state and describe a new
correspondence between EDT and the balls in boxes model. The latter gives rise
to a modified partition function with an additional, third coupling. Finally,
we propose and motivate a class of modified path-integral measures that might
remove the metastability of the Markov chain and turn the phase transition into
second order.

with separate hydrophobic/hydrophilic domains along the tube as well as random

channel is found to vary nonlinearly as a function of f, and a small fraction
of hydrophilic atoms (f ~ 0.4) are sufficient to induce spontaneous and
continuous filling of the nanotube. Interestingly, the average number of water
molecules inside the channel and water flux through the nanotube are less
sensitive to the specific arrangement of hydrophilic atoms than to the

on f - an approximately linear increase in flux as a function of f for f < 0.4,
and almost no change in flux for higher f values, similar to the change in
water occupancy. We are able to define an effective interaction strength

Magnetic Bright Points (MBPs). Apart from simple $V/I$ magnetograms, the most
common method to deduce their magnetic properties is the inversion of
spectropolarimetric data. Here we employ the SIR code for that purpose. SIR is
a well-established tool that can derive not only the magnetic field vector and
other atmospheric parameters (e.g., temperature, line-of-sight velocity), but
also their stratifications with height, effectively producing 3-dimensional

least one month, and one feature near 34\deg S (termed S34) seems to have
persisted for nearly two decades, a conclusion derived with the help of Voyager
2 and HST observations. S34 oscillates in latitude between 32\deg S and
36.5\deg S, with a period of $\sim$1000 days, which may be a result of a
non-barotropic Rossby wave. It also varied its longitudinal drift rate between
-20\deg /day and -31\deg /day in approximate accord with the latitudinal
gradient in the zonal wind profile, exhibiting behavior similar to that of the
DS2 feature observed on Neptune (Sromovsky et al., Icarus 105, 110-141, 1993).
S34 also exhibits a superimposed rapid oscillation with an amplitude of
0.57\deg in latitude and period of 0.7 days, which is approximately consistent

an overall stability diagram for helix formation similar to that from experi-

different peptide conformations sampled using TIP3P. Rather, there is a
critical role for the solvent itself in determining the dependence of total
system volume (peptide and solvent) on helix content. Helical peptide
structures exclude a smaller volume to water, relative to non-helical
structures with both the water models, but the total system volume for helical
conformations is higher than non-helical conformations with TIP3P water at low

Then, we compare our results with XMM-Newton observations of the Herbig-Haro
object HH 248, where extended X-ray emission aligned with the optical knots is
detected at the edge of the nearby IC 434 cloud. Our simulations show that a
jet can produce plasma with temperatures up to 10 MK, consistent with
production of X-ray emission, after impacting a dense cloud. We find that jets
denser than the ambient medium but less dense than the cloud produce detectable
X-ray emission only at the impact onto the cloud. From the exploration of the
model parameter space, we constrain the physical conditions (jet density and
velocity, cloud density) that reproduce well the intrinsic luminosity and
emission measure of the X-ray source possibly associated with HH 248. Thus, we
suggest that the extended X-ray source close to HH 248 corresponds to the jet

situations. An attempt is made to categorize existing contact models for the
normal force, discuss all the essential mechanical ingredients that must enter
the model (qualitatively) and finally solve it analytically. The model combines
a short-ranged, non-contact part (resembling either dry or wet materials) with
an elaborate, visco-elasto-plastic and adhesive contact law. Using energy
conservation arguments, an analytical expression for the coefficient of
restitution is derived in terms of the impact velocity (for pair interactions
or, equivalently, without loss of generality, for quasi-static situations in
terms of the maximum overlap or confining stress). Adhesive particles (or
meso-particles) stick to each other at very low impact velocity, while they
rebound less dissipatively with increasing velocity, in agreement with previous
studies. For even higher impact velocities an interesting second sticking and
rebound regime is reported. The low velocity sticking is due to non-contact
adhesive forces, the first rebound regime is due to stronger elastic and
kinetic energies with little dissipation, while the high velocity sticking is
generated by the non-linearly increasing, history dependent plastic dissipation

Mixing of local thermal or local kinetic equilibrium systems with different
temperatures yields a locally averaged temperature rise, which is proportional
to the square of temperature perturbations damping in the photon diffusion
scale. Such secondary temperature perturbations are indistinguishable from the
standard temperature perturbations linearly coming from primordial curvature
perturbations and hence should be subdominant compared to the standard ones. We
show that small-scale higher order correlation functions (connected
non-Gaussian and disconnected Gaussian parts) of primordial curvature
perturbations can be probed by investigating auto power spectrum of the
generated secondary perturbations and the cross power spectrum with the
standard perturbations. This is simply because these power spectra come from
higher order correlation functions of primordial curvature perturbations with
non-linear parameters such as $f_{\rm NL}$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}$ since secondary
temperature perturbations are second order effects. Thus, the observational
results $l(l+1)C^{TT}_l\simeq 6\times 10^{-10}$ at large scales give a robust
and universal upper bound on small-scale non-Gaussianities of primordial

gathered using a companion robot equipped with a Kinect. The evaluation on our

validates the use of such a technique in a real environment. Experimental
validation shows that multimodal features set gives better precision and recall
than using only spatial and speed features. We also demonstrate that 7 selected
features are sufficient to provide a good starting engagement detection score.
In our last investigation, we show that among our full 99 features set, the
space reduction is not a solved task. This result opens new researches

reconstruction of the Fermi surface (FS). Under pressure, S/T increases
strongly of at low temperature near the critical pressure Pc, where the AF
order is suppressed, implying the interplay of a FS change and low energy

interpreted by the dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ via a light

singlet scalar is useful to achieve a strongly first order phase transition
required by the electroweak baryogenesis. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility that the NMSSM model can simultaneously accommodate these two
issues. The phase transition strength can be characterized by the vacua energy
gap at zero temperature and be sufficiently enhanced by the tree-level effect
in the NMSSM. We find that the annihilation of Singlino/Higgsino DM particles
occurring close to the light pseudoscalar resonance is favored by the galactic
center excess and the observed DM relic density, and a resulting small
$\kappa/\lambda$ and a negative $A_\kappa$ can also lead to a successful
strongly first order electroweak phase transition.

unravel questions about online individuals' behavior at scale, but also allows
to explore the potential perils that the massive adoption of social media
brings to our society. These communication channels provide plenty of
incentives (both economical and social) and opportunities for abuse. As social
media activity became increasingly intertwined with the events in the offline
world, individuals and organizations have found ways to exploit these platforms
to spread misinformation, to attack and smear others, or to deceive and
manipulate. During crises, social media have been effectively used for
emergency response, but fear-mongering actions have also triggered mass
hysteria and panic. Criminal gangs and terrorist organizations like ISIS adopt
social media for propaganda and recruitment. Synthetic activity and social bots
have been used to coordinate orchestrated astroturf campaigns, to manipulate
political elections and the stock market. The lack of effective content
verification systems on many of these platforms, including Twitter and
Facebook, rises concerns when younger users become exposed to cyber-bulling,
harassment, or hate speech, inducing risks like depression and suicide. This
article illustrates some of the recent advances facing these issues and
discusses what it remains to be done, including the challenges to address in
the future to make social media a more useful and accessible, safer and

complementary problem of how to form groups such that the users in the formed

that the recommendations will be generated according to one of the two group
recommendation semantics - LM or AV. Rather than assuming groups are given, or
rely on ad hoc group formation dynamics, our framework allows a strategic
approach for forming groups of users in order to maximize satisfaction. We show
that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally under both semantics.

non-trivial local (in a precise standard sense) and diffeomorphism invariant

the most important properties that follow from the standard definition of
locality, yet is flexible enough to admit a large class of diffeomorphism
invariant observables in GR. The generalization comes at a small price, that
the domain of definition of a generalized local observable may not cover the
entire phase space of GR and two such observables may have distinct domains.
However, the subset of metrics on which generalized local observables can be
defined is in a sense generic (its open interior is non-empty in the Whitney
strong topology). Moreover, generalized local gauge invariant observables are
sufficient to separate diffeomorphism orbits on this admissible subset of the
phase space. Connecting the construction with the notion of differential
invariants, gives a general scheme for defining generalized local gauge
invariant observables in arbitrary gauge theories, which happens to agree with
well-known results for Maxwell and Yang-Mills theories.

observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark
energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a
wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010
Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top
priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey,
WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to
determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program
utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science
Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office
at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an
implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope
assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the
earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4
DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission
with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m
designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the
primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility.
The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design
enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.

spectral resolution (R ~ 38,000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ~ 50-300)
spectra collected with UVES at ESO VLT. The current measurements were
complemented with Cepheid abundances either provided by our group (75) or
available in the literature, for a total of 439 Galactic Cepheids. Special
attention was given in providing a homogeneous abundance scale for these five
elements plus iron (Genovali et al. 2013, 2014). In addition, accurate
Galactocentric distances (RG) based on near-infrared photometry are also
available for all the Cepheids in the sample (Genovali et al. 2014). They cover
a large fraction of the Galactic thin disk (4.1 <= RG <= 18.4 kpc). We found
that the above five elements display well defined linear radial gradients and
modest standard deviations over the entire range of RG. Moreover, the
[element/Fe] abundance ratios are constant across the entire thin disk; only
the Ca radial distribution shows marginal evidence of a positive slope. These
results indicate that the chemical enrichment history of iron and of the quoted
five elements has been quite similar across the four quadrants of the Galactic
thin disk. The [element/Fe] ratios are also constant over the entire period
range. This empirical evidence indicates that the chemical enrichment of
Galactic Cepheids has also been very homogenous during the range in age that
they cover (~10-300 Myr). Once again, [Ca/Fe] vs. log(P) shows a (negative)
gradient, being underabundant among youngest Cepheids. Finally, we also found
that Cepheid abundances agree quite well with similar abundances for thin and
thick disk dwarf stars and they follow the typical Mg-Al and Na-O correlations.

bias barrier height and decrease in the ideality factor are observed with
increasing temperature for both junctions. Such behavior is attributed to
barrier inhomogeneities that arise from interfacial states as revealed by
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of
the barrier heights, mean values of 1.14(+/-)0.14 eV and 0.76(+/-)0.10 eV are
found for graphene Si and GaAs junctions, respectively. These findings provide
insights into the barrier height inhomogeneities in graphene based Schottky
junctions, essential for the integration of graphene with Si and GaAs device
architectures.

This opens up a wide area of research which poses need to have a framework for

crackling bursts in a fiber bundle model of the creep rupture of heterogeneous
materials. In the model fibers break due to two mechanisms: slowly accumulating
damage triggers bursts of immediate breakings analogous to acoustic emissions
in experiments. The rupture process accelerates such that the size of breaking
avalanches increases while the waiting time between consecutive events
decreases towards failure. Record events are defined as bursts which have a
larger size than all previous events in the time series. We analyze the
statistics of records focusing on the limit of equal load sharing (ELS) of the
model and compare the results to the record statistics of sequences of
independent identically distributed random variables. Computer simulations
revealed that the number of records grows with the logarithm of the event
number except for the close vicinity of macroscopic failure where an
exponential dependence is evidenced. The two regimes can be attributed to the
dominance of disorder with small burst sizes and to stress enhancements giving
rise efficient triggering of extended bursts, respectively. Both the size of
records and the increments between consecutive record events are characterized
by power law distributions with a common exponent 1.33 significantly different
from the usual ELS burst size exponents of fiber bundles. The distribution of
waiting times follows the same behavior, however, with two distinct exponents
for low and high loads. Studying the evolution of records we identify a load
dependent characteristic scale of the system which separates slow down and
acceleration of record breaking as failure is approached.

critical point-like bandgap do not show a clear temperature dependence. We also
observe some weak discrete absorption features around the strong charge
transfer transitions with energies matching well to low-temperature
photoluminescence signals.

timber engineering. In this combined numerical and experimental approach,
damage onset and propagation in uni-directional and cross-laminated samples out
of European beech due to climatic changes are studied. The inter- and
intra-laminar damage evolution is characterized for various configurations
adhesively bonded by three structural adhesive systems. Typical situations are
simulated by means of a comprehensive moisture-dependent non-linear rheological
finite element model for wood with the capability to capture delaminations. The
simulations give insight into the role of different strain components such as
visco-elastic, mechano-sorptive, plastic, and hygro-elastic deformations under
changing moisture content in progressive damage and delamination. We show the
stress buildup under cyclic hygric loading resulting in hygro-fatigue and
modify an analytical micro-mechanics of damage model, originally developed for
cross-ply laminates, to describe the problem of moisture-induced damage in
beech lamellae.

that alter the global characteristics of the network and obfuscate the most
important structures therein. Graph pruning is the process of identifying the
most significant edges according to a generative null model, and extracting the
subgraph consisting of those edges. Here, we focus on integer-weighted graphs
commonly arising when weights count the occurrences of an ""event"" relating the
nodes. We introduce a simple and intuitive null model related to the
configuration model of network generation, and derive two significance filters
from it: the Marginal Likelihood Filter (MLF) and the Global Likelihood Filter
(GLF). The former is a fast algorithm assigning a significance score to each
edge based on the marginal distribution of edge weights whereas the latter is
an ensemble approach which takes into account the correlations among edges. We
apply these filters to the network of air traffic volume between US airports
and recover a geographically faithful representation of the graph. Furthermore,
compared with thresholding based on edge weight, we show that our filters
extract a larger and significantly sparser giant component.

we report the first microwave characterization of the real permittivity tensor
of a bulk YSO sample, as well as an investigation of the temperature dependence
of the tensor components from 296 K down to 6 K. Estimated uncertainties were
below 0.26%, limited by the precision of machining the cylindrical dielectric.
Also, the electrical Q-factors of a few electromagnetic modes were recorded as
a way to provide some information about the crystal losses over the temperature
range. To solve the tensor components necessary for a biaxial crystal, we
developed the multi-mode technique, which uses simultaneous measurement of low
order Whispering Gallery Modes. Knowledge of the permittivity tensor offers
important data, essential for the design of technologies involving YSO, such as
microwave coupling to electron and hyperfine transitions in RE doped samples at
low temperatures.

gravity where $F$ is a generic function of the curvature scalar $R$ and the
Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant $\cal G$. The main feature that emerges in
this analysis is the fact that this kind of theory can exhaust all the
curvature budget related to curvature invariants without considering
derivatives of $R,$ $R_{\mu\nu}$, $R^{\lambda}_{\sigma\mu\nu}$ etc. in the
action. Cosmological dynamics results driven by two effective masses (lenghts)
related to the $R$ scalaron and the $\cal G$ scalaron working respectively at
early and very early epochs of cosmic evolution. In this sense, a double
inflationary scenario naturally emerges.

related to the fundamental problems of physics itself such as determinism,
causality, free will, predictability, and irreversibility [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn.
{\bf 79}, 15002 (2010)]. This letter reveals a structure hidden behind the
primitive chaos; under some conditions, a new primitive chaos is constructed
from the original primitive chaos, this procedure can be repeated, and the
hierarchic structure of the primitive chaos is obtained. This implies such a
picture that new events and causality is constructed from the old ones, with
the aid of the concept of a coarse graining. As an application of this
structure, interesting facts are revealed for the essential condition of the
primitive chaos and for the chaotic behaviors.

groups, where each group is composed by academics or researchers. To assess
academic productivity we propose a new metric, which we call P-score. Our
metric P-score assigns weights to venues using only the publication patterns of
selected reference groups. This implies that P-score does not depend on
citation data and thus, that it is simpler to compute particularly in contexts
in which citation data is not easily available. Also, preliminary experiments
suggest that P-score preserves strong correlation with citation-based metrics.

of a few sources from a limited number of observations on an array of sensors,
thus it can be formulated as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and solved
efficiently with compressive sensing (CS) to achieve high-resolution imaging.
On a discrete angular grid, the CS reconstruction degrades due to basis
mismatch when the DOAs do not coincide with the angular directions on the grid.
To overcome this limitation, a continuous formulation of the DOA problem is
employed and an optimization procedure is introduced, which promotes sparsity
on a continuous optimization variable. The DOA estimation problem with
infinitely many unknowns, i.e., source locations and amplitudes, is solved over
a few optimization variables with semidefinite programming. The grid-free CS
reconstruction provides high-resolution imaging even with non-uniform arrays,
single-snapshot data and under noisy conditions as demonstrated on experimental
towed array data.
