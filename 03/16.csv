  Measure","Proceedings of American Control Conference, Chicago IL, 2015",,,,"math.DS cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the stability problem of a stochastic, nonlinear,
discrete-time system. We introduce a linear transfer operator-based Lyapunov
measure as a new tool for stability verification of stochastic systems. Weaker
set-theoretic notion of almost everywhere stochastic stability is introduced
and verified, using Lyapunov measure-based stochastic stability theorems.
Furthermore, connection between Lyapunov functions, a popular tool for
stochastic stability verification, and Lyapunov measures is established. Using
the duality property between the linear transfer Perron-Frobenius and Koopman
operators, we show the Lyapunov measure and Lyapunov function used for the
verification of stochastic stability are dual to each other. Set-oriented
numerical methods are proposed for the finite dimensional approximation of the
Perron-Frobenius operator; hence, Lyapunov measure is proposed. Stability
results in finite dimensional approximation space are also presented. Finite
dimensional approximation is shown to introduce further weaker notion of
stability referred to as coarse stochastic stability. The results in this paper
extend our earlier work on the use of Lyapunov measures for almost everywhere
stability verification of deterministic dynamical systems (""Lyapunov Measure
for Almost Everywhere Stability"", {\it IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control}, Vol.

Holographically, this is dual to the dynamical meson melting in the N = 2 super
Yang-Milles theory. If the final temperature of the system is large enough, the
probe D7-brane will dynamically cross the horizon (black hole embedding). By
turning on the external magnetic field and raising it sufficiently, the final
embedding of the corresponding D7-brane changes to Minkowski embedding. In the
field theory side, this means that the mesons which melt due to the raise in
the temperature, will form bound states again by applying an external magnetic
field. We will also show that the evolution of the system to its final
equilibrium state is postponed due to the presence of the magnetic field.

For the first time the simultaneous action of rotation and magnetic diffusion
are taken into account and the effects of a poloidal field on the dynamic
evolution of unstable toroidal magnetic fields is included. In the absence of
diffusion, fast rotation (rotation rate compared to Alfv\'en frequency) is able
to suppress the instability when the rotation and magnetic axes are aligned and
when the radial field strength gradient p < 1.5. When diffusion is included,
this system turns unstable for diffusion dominated and marginally diffusive
dominated regions. If the magnetic and rotation axes are perpendicular to each
other the stabilizing effect induced by the Coriolis force is scale dependent
and decreases with increasing wavenumber. In toroidal fields with radial field
gradients bigger than p > 1.5, rapid rotation does not suppress the instability
but instead introduces a damping factor to the growth rate in agreement with
the analytic predictions. For the mixed poloidal-toroidal fields we find an
unstable axisymmetric mode, not predicted analytically, right at the stability
threshold for the non-axisymmetric modes; it has been argued that an
axisymmetric mode is necessary for the closure of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo
loop.

of the evolution of the X-ray lags of the broad-band variability component
(0.008-5 Hz) in GX 339-4 as a function of the position of the source in the
hardness-intensity diagram. The hard photons always lag the soft ones,
consistent with previous results. In the low-hard state the lags correlate with
X-ray intensity, and as the source starts the transition to the
intermediate/soft states, the lags first increase faster, and then appear to
reach a maximum, although the exact evolution depends on the outburst and the
energy band used to calculate the lags. The time of the maximum of the lags
appears to coincide with a sudden drop of the Optical/NIR flux, the fractional
RMS amplitude of the broadband component in the power spectrum, and the
appearance of a thermal component in the X-ray spectra, strongly suggesting
that the lags can be very useful to understand the physical changes that GX
339-4 undergoes during an outburst. We find strong evidence for a connection
between the evolution of the cut-off energy of the hard component in the energy
spectrum and the phase lags, suggesting that the average magnitude of the lags
is correlated with the properties of the corona/jet rather than those of the
disc. Finally, we show that the lags in GX 339-4 evolve in a similar manner to
those of the black-hole candidate Cygnus X-1, suggesting similar phenomena
could be observable in other black-hole systems.

nonemptiness and regularity of the Severi variety parametrizing $\delta$-nodal
curves in the linear system $|L|$ for $0\leq \delta\leq n-1=p-2$ (here $p$ is
the arithmetic genus of any curve in $|L|$). We also show that a general genus
$g$ curve having as nodal model a hyperplane section of some $(1,n)$-polarized
abelian surface admits only finitely many such models up to translation;
moreover, any such model lies on finitely many $(1,n)$-polarized abelian

proved concerning the possibility of deforming a genus $g$ curve in $S$
equigenerically to a nodal curve. The rest of the paper deals with the

negative and some other inequalities are satisfied, the locus $|L|^r_d$ of

the electrical conductance depends on changes in the drift velocity and the

conductance of the electrolyte. We characterized the length of the electric
field lines by a tortuosity and the changes in drift velocity by a constriction
factor. Both the tortuosity and the constriction factor are descriptors of the
pore microstructure. We define a conductance reduction factor to measure the
local contributions of the pore microstructure to the global conductance. It is
shown that the global conductance reduction factor is the product of the
tortuosity squared divided by the constriction factor, thereby proving that the
combined effect of tortuosity and constriction, in addition to the porosity and
conductance of the electrolyte, fully describes the effective electrical
conductance of a porous medium. We show that our tortuosity, constriction

for idealized porous media. They are also applied to Bentheimer sandstone,

conductivity using both the global conductance reduction factor and the
distinct contributions from tortuosity and constriction. Overall, this work
shows how the empirical Archie cementation exponent can be substituted by more

way to make intersections controlled with traffic lights more efficient. This
goal was accomplished through the creation of a genetic algorithm, which
enhances an input algorithm through genetic principles to produce the fittest
algorithm. The program was comprised of two major elements: coding in Java and
coding in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), which is an environment that
simulates real traffic. The Java code called upon the SUMO simulation via a
command prompt which ran the simulation, received the output, altered the
algorithm, and looped. The SUMO component initialized a simulation in which a 1
x 1 street layout was created, each intersection with its own traffic light.
Each loop enhanced the input algorithm by altering the scheduling string
(dictates the light changes). After the looped simulations were executed, the
data was then analyzed. This was accomplished by creating an algorithm based
upon regular practice, timed traffic lights, and comparing the output which was
comprised of the total time it took for all vehicles to exit the system and the
average time it took each individual vehicle to exit the system. These
different variables: the time it took the average vehicle to exit the system

the universal pre-uniformity $p\mathcal U_X$ on $X$. For a pre-uniformity
$\mathcal U$ on a set $X$ and a word $v$ in the two-letter alphabet $\{+,-\}$
we define the verbal power $\mathcal U^v$ of $\mathcal U$ and study its
boundedness numbers $\ell(\mathcal U^v)$ and $\bar \ell(\mathcal U^v)$. The
boundedness numbers of the (Boolean operations over) the verbal powers of the
canonical pre-uniformities $p\mathcal U_X$, $q\mathcal U_X$ and $\mathcal U_X$
yield new cardinal characteristics $\ell^v(X)$, $\bar \ell^v(X)$, $q\ell^v(X)$,
$q\bar \ell^v(X)$, $u\ell(X)$ of a topological space $X$, which generalize all
known cardinal topological invariants related to (star)-covering properties. We
study the relation of the new cardinal invariants $\ell^v$, $\bar \ell^v$ to
classical cardinal topological invariants such as Lindel\""of number $\ell$,
density $d$, and spread $s$. The simplest new verbal cardinal invariant is the
foredensity $\ell^-(X)$ defined for a topological space $X$ as the smallest
cardinal $\kappa$ such that for any neighborhood assignment $(O_x)_{x\in X}$
there is a subset $A\subset X$ of cardinality $|A|\le\kappa$ that meets each
neighborhood $O_x$, $x\in X$. It is clear that $\ell^-(X)\le d(X)\le
\ell^-(X)\cdot \chi(X)$. We shall prove that $\ell^-(X)=d(X)$ if
$|X|<\aleph_\omega$. On the other hand, for every singular cardinal $\kappa$
(with $\kappa\le 2^{2^{cf(\kappa)}}$) we construct a (totally disconnected)
$T_1$-space $X$ such that $\ell^-(X)=cf(\kappa)<\kappa=|X|=d(X)$.

spectra inspired by ""Brane Supersymmetry Breaking"". This mechanism splits Bose
and Fermi excitations in String Theory, leaving behind an exponential potential
that is just too steep for the inflaton to emerge from the initial singularity
while descending it. As a result, the scalar generically bounces against the
exponential wall, which typically introduces an infrared depression and a
pre--inflationary peak in the power spectrum of scalar perturbations. We
elaborate on a possible link between this phenomenon and the low--$\ell$ CMB.
For the first 32 multipoles, combining the hard exponential with a milder one
leading to $n_s\simeq 0.96$ and with a small gaussian bump we have attained a
reduction of $\chi^{\,2}$ to about 46% of the standard $\Lambda$CDM setting,
with both WMAP9 and PLANCK 2013 data. This result corresponds to a
$\chi^{\,2}/DOF$ of about 0.45, to be compared with a $\Lambda$CDM value of
about 0.85. The preferred choices combine naturally quadrupole depression, a
first peak around $\ell=5$ and a wide minimum around $\ell=20$. We have also
gathered some evidence that similar spectra emerge if the hard exponential is
combined with more realistic models of inflation. A problem of the preferred
examples is their slow convergence to an almost scale--invariant profile.

This framework gives a remarkably simple and general description of the

accurately describe the transport phenomena irrespective of the nature of

for implementing quantum information in superconducting devices, since it is
both insensitive to charge noise (like flux qubits) and insensitive to flux
noise (like charge qubits). Here, we investigate the stability of the quantum
information to quasiparticle tunneling through a Josephson junction.
Microscopically, this dephasing is due to the dependence of the quasiparticle
transmission probability on the qubit state. We argue that on a
phenomenological level the dephasing mechanism can be understood as originating
from heat currents, which are flowing in the device due to possible effective
temperature gradients, and their sensitivity to the qubit state. The emerging
dephasing time is found to be insensitive to the number of junctions with which
the superinductance of the fluxonium qubit is realised. Furthermore, we find
that the dephasing time increases quadratically with the shunt-inductance of
the circuit which highlights the stability of the device to this dephasing
mechanism.

for large sparse linear systems, proposed by Grote and Huckle [SIAM J. Sci.
Comput., 18 (1997), pp.~838--853.], is based on the F-norm minimization and
computes a sparse approximate inverse $M$ of a large sparse matrix $A$
adaptively. However, SPAI may be costly to seek the most profitable indices at
each loop and $M$ may be ineffective for preconditioning. In this paper, we
propose a residual based sparse approximate inverse preconditioning procedure
(RSAI), which, unlike SPAI, is based on only the {\em dominant} rather than all
information on the current residual and augments sparsity patterns adaptively
during the loops. RSAI is less costly to seek indices and is more effective to
capture a good approximate sparsity pattern of $A^{-1}$ than SPAI. To control
the sparsity of $M$ and reduce computational cost, we develop a practical
RSAI($tol$) algorithm that drops small nonzero entries adaptively during the
process. Numerical experiments are reported to demonstrate that RSAI($tol$) is
at least competitive with SPAI and can be considerably more efficient and
effective than SPAI. They also indicate that RSAI($tol$) is comparable to the
PSAI($tol$) algorithm proposed by one of the authors in 2009.

  Self-Assembly Systems",,,,,"cs.CG cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we extend existing results about simulation and intrinsic
universality in a model of tile-based self-assembly. Namely, we work within the
2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), which is a model of self-assembly in which
assemblies are formed by square tiles that are allowed to combine, using glues
along their edges, individually or as pairs of arbitrarily large assemblies in
a hierarchical manner, and we explore the abilities of these systems to
simulate each other when the simulating systems have a higher ""temperature""
parameter, which is a system wide threshold dictating how many glue bonds must
be formed between two assemblies to allow them to combine. It has previously
been shown that systems with lower temperatures cannot simulate arbitrary
systems with higher temperatures, and also that systems at some higher
temperatures can simulate those at particular lower temperatures, creating an
infinite set of infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing
simulation power within each hierarchy. These previous results relied on two
different definitions of simulation, one (strong simulation) seemingly more
restrictive than the other (standard simulation), but which have previously not
been proven to be distinct. Here we prove distinctions between them by first
fully characterizing the set of pairs of temperatures such that the high
temperature systems are intrinsically universal for the lower temperature
systems (i.e. one tile set at the higher temperature can simulate any at the
lower) using strong simulation. This includes the first impossibility result
for simulation downward in temperature. We then show that lower temperature
systems which cannot be simulated by higher temperature systems using the
strong definition, can in fact be simulated using the standard definition,
proving the distinction between the types of simulation.

region NOAA 11996 with the \textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph}

owing to the interaction between its magnetic fields and an nearby emerging
flux region (EFR) is firstly observed. The line-of-sight magnetograms from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the SDO reveal that the dome is
located on the mixed magnetic fields, with its rim rooted in the redundant
positive polarity surrounding the minority parasitic negative fields. The fan
surface of the dome consists of a filament system and recurring jets are
observed along its spine. The jet occurring around 13:54 UT is accompanied with
a quasi-circular ribbon that brightens in the clockwise direction along the
bottom rim of the dome, which may indicate an occurrence of slipping
reconnection in the fan-spine topology. The EFR emerges continuously and meets
with the magnetic fields of the dome. Magnetic cancellations take place between
the emerging negative polarity and the outer positive polarity of the dome's
fields, which lead to the rise of the loop connecting the EFR and brightenings
related to the dome. A single Gaussian fit to the profiles of the IRIS SI IV
1394 \AA\ line is used in the analysis. It appears that there are two rising
components along the slit, except for the rise in the line-of-sight direction.
The cancellation process repeats again and again. Eventually the fan-spine dome
is destroyed and a new connectivity is formed. We suggest that magnetic
reconnection between the EFR and the magnetic fields of the fan-spine dome in
the process is responsible for the destruction of the dome.

account of the CR diffusion along the magnetic field but neglect the
cross-field-line diffusion. Two models are considered in this paper: shearing
box model and differentially rotating cylinder model. We studied how MRI is
affected by the initial CR pressure (i.e., energy) distribution. In the
shearing box model, the initial state is uniform distribution. Linear analysis
shows that the growth rate of MRI does not depend on the value of CR diffusion
coefficient. In the differentially rotating cylinder model, the initial state
is a constant angular momentum polytropic disk threaded by weak uniform
vertical magnetic field. Linear analysis shows that the growth rate of MRI
becomes larger if the CR diffusion coefficient is larger. Both results are
confirmed by MHD simulations. The MHD simulation results show that the outward
movement of matter by the growth of MRI is not impeded by the CR pressure
gradient, and the centrifugal force which acts to the concentrated matter
becomes larger. Consequently, the growth rate of MRI is increased. On the other
hand, if the initial CR pressure is uniform, then the growth rate of the MRI
barely depends on the value of the CR diffusion coefficient.

Using powdered polycrystalline samples oriented by different methods, the field
dependences of NMR shift and nuclear spin relaxation rates for H_0 // c (easy
axis) and H_0 // b were obtained. From the NMR shifts for H_0 // b, we
confirmed a gradual suppression of the Curie temperature and observed a phase
separation near the spin reorientation. The observation of the phase separation
gives microscopic evidence that the spin reorientation under H_0 // b is of
first order at low temperatures. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1
indicates that the magnetic fluctuations are suppressed for H_0 // c, whereas
the fluctuations remain strongly for H_0 // b. The enhancements of both 1/T_1T
and the nuclear spin-spin relaxation rate 1/T_2 for H_0 // b toward the spin
reorientation field suggest that the field-induced superconductivity in URhGe
emerges under the magnetic fluctuations along the b axis and the c axis.

enforcing complex program properties. These systems combine linear types with a
language of type-level indices, allowing more fine-grained analyses. Such
systems have been fruitfully applied in diverse domains, including implicit
complexity and differential privacy. A natural way to enhance the
expressiveness of this approach is by allowing the indices to depend on runtime
information, in the spirit of dependent types. This approach is used in DFuzz,
a language for differential privacy. The DFuzz type system relies on an index
language supporting real and natural number arithmetic over constants and
variables. Moreover, DFuzz uses a subtyping mechanism to make types more
flexible. By themselves, linearity, dependency, and subtyping each require
delicate handling when performing type checking or type inference; their
combination increases this challenge substantially, as the features can
interact in non-trivial ways. In this paper, we study the type-checking problem
for DFuzz. We show how we can reduce type checking for (a simple extension of)
DFuzz to constraint solving over a first-order theory of naturals and real
numbers which, although undecidable, can often be handled in practice by
standard numeric solvers.

the radius of influence of the SMBH, revealing an abrupt increase in the
stellar velocity dispersion within 10 pc from the nucleus, consistent with the
presence of a SMBH there. Assuming that the galaxy nucleus is in a steady state
and that the velocity dispersion ellipsoid is aligned with a cylindrical
coordinate system, we constructed a Jeans anisotropic dynamical model to fit
the observed kinematics distribution. Our dynamical model assumes that the
galaxy has axial symmetry and is constructed using the multi-gaussian expansion
method to parametrize the observed surface brightness distribution. The Jeans
dynamical model has three free parameters: the mass of the central SMBH, the
mass-luminosity ratio of the galaxy and the anisotropy of the velocity
distribution. We test two types of models: one with constant velocity
anisotropy, and another with variable anisotropy. The model that best
reproduces the observed kinematics was obtained considering that the galaxy has
radially varying anisotropy, being the best-fitting parameters with 3$\sigma$
significance $M_\bullet=4.8^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\times 10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and
$\Gamma_k = 4.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. This value for the mass of the SMBH is just 25

different cancer cell phenotypes, which extends the cellular hierarchy proposed
by the classical cancer stem cell (CSC) theory. Since it is still question able
if the phenotypic plasticity is a crucial improvement to the hierarchical model
or just a minor extension to it, it is worthwhile to explore the dynamic
behavior characterizing the reversible phenotypic plasticity. In this study we
compare the hierarchical model and the reversible model in predicting the
cell-state dynamics observed in biological experiments. Our results show that
the hierarchical model shows significant disadvantages over the reversible
model in describing both long-term stability (phenotypic equilibrium) and
short-term transient dynamics (overshoot) of cancer cells. In a very specific
case in which the total growth of population due to each cell type is
identical, the hierarchical model predicts neither phenotypic equilibrium nor
overshoot, whereas thereversible model succeeds in predicting both of them.
Even though the performance of the hierarchical model can be improved by
relaxing the specific assumption, its prediction to the phenotypic equilibrium
strongly depends on a precondition that may be unrealistic in biological
experiments, and it also fails to capture the overshoot of CSCs. By comparison,
it is more likely for the reversible model to correctly describe the stability
of the phenotypic mixture and various types of overshoot behavior.

that two fillings of $F_g$ are in the same $\text{Mod}(F_g)$-orbit if and only

the presence of driving field, current and transverse magnetic field is
investigated by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert(LLG) equation with the adiabatic
and non-adiabatic spin-transfer torques both analytically and numerically. The
analytical expressions for the velocity, width, excitation angle and
displacement for the domain wall are obtained by using small angle
approximation along with Walkers trial function. The results show that the
initial velocity of the domain wall can be controlled by the adiabatic
spin-transfer torque and the saturated velocity can be controlled by the
non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque and driving field. The large increase in the
saturated velocity of the domain wall driven by current and field due to the
transverse magnetic field is identified through the presence of driving field.
There is no impact in the saturated velocity of the domain wall driven by
current from the transverse magnetic field. For the domain wall driven by the
current in the presence of the transverse magnetic field, the saturated
velocity remains constant. The transverse magnetic field along with current and
driving field is more advantageous that the transverse magnetic field along
with current for increasing the saturated velocity of the domain wall. The
numerical results showed that the saturated velocity is increased by the
transverse magnetic field with the irrespective of the directions of the
driving field and current further it is higher and lower when the directions of
driving field and current are antiparallel and parallel respectively. The
obtained analytical solutions are closely coincided with the computed numerical

a novel transport phenomenon in which the Hall resistance reaches the quantum

has been discovered experimentally in an ultrathin film of the Bi2Te3 family TI
with spontaneous ferromagnetic (FM) order. An important question concerning the
QAH state is whether it is simply a zero-magnetic-field version of the quantum
Hall (QH) effect, or if there is new physics beyond the conventional paradigm.
Here we report experimental investigations on the quantum phase transition
between the two opposite Hall plateaus of a QAH insulator caused by
magnetization reversal. We observe a well-defined plateau with zero Hall
conductivity over a range of magnetic field around coercivity, consistent with
a recent theoretical prediction. The features of the zero Hall plateau are
shown to be closely related to that of the QAH effect, but its temperature
evolution exhibits quantitative differences from the network model for
conventional QH plateau transition. We propose that the chiral edge states
residing at the magnetic domain boundaries, which are unique to a QAH
insulator, are responsible for the zero Hall plateau. The rich magnetic domain
dynamics makes the QAH effect a distinctive class of quantum phenomenon that
may find novel applications in spintronics.

in the Galactic bulge have challenged the picture of an exclusively old stellar
population. However, these age estimates have not been independently confirmed.
In this paper we verify these results by means of a grid-based method and
quantify the systematic biases that might be induced by some assumptions
adopted to compute stellar models. We explore the impact of increasing the
initial helium abundance, neglecting the element microscopic diffusion, and
changing the mixing-length calibration in theoretical stellar track
computations. We adopt the SCEPtER pipeline with a novel stellar model grid for
metallicities [Fe/H] from -2.00 to 0.55 dex, and masses in the range [0.60;
1.60] Msun from the ZAMS to the helium flash at the red giant branch tip. We
show for the considered evolutionary phases that our technique provides
unbiased age estimates. Our age results are in good agreement with Bensby and
collaborators findings and show 16 stars younger than 5 Gyr and 28 younger than
9 Gyr over a sample of 58. The effect of a helium enhancement as large as Delta
Y/Delta Z = 5 is quite modest, resulting in a mean age increase of metal rich
stars of 0.6 Gyr. Even simultaneously adopting a high helium content and the
upper values of age estimates, there is evidence of 4 stars younger than 5 Gyr
and 15 younger than 9 Gyr. For stars younger than 5 Gyr, the use of stellar
models computed by neglecting microscopic diffusion or by assuming a
super-solar mixing-length value leads to a mean increase in the age estimates
of about 0.4 Gyr and 0.5 Gyr respectively. Even considering the upper values
for the age estimates, there are four stars estimated younger than 5 Gyr is in
both cases. Thus, the assessment of a sizeable fraction of young stars among
the microlensed sample in the Galactic bulge appears robust.

reproducing. Directly getting offspring is the most basic form of fitness, but
fitness can also be increased indirectly by helping genetically related
individuals (such as kin) to increase their fitness. The combined effect is
known as inclusive fitness. Here it is argued that a further elaboration of
fitness has evolved, particularly in humans. It is called extensive fitness and
it incorporates producing organisms that are merely similar in phenotype. The
evolvability of this mechanism is illustrated by computations on a simple model
combining heredity and behaviour. Phenotypes are driven into the direction of
high fitness through a mechanism that involves an internal estimate of fitness,
implicitly made within the organism itself. This mechanism has recently been
conjectured to be responsible for producing agency and goals. In the model,
inclusive and extensive fitness are both implemented by letting fitness
increase nonlinearly with the size of subpopulations of similar heredity (for
the indirect part of inclusive fitness) and of similar phenotype (for the
phenotypic part of extensive fitness). Populations implementing extensive
fitness outcompete populations implementing mere inclusive fitness. This occurs
because groups with similar phenotype tend to be larger than groups with
similar heredity, and fitness increases more when groups are larger. Extensive
fitness has two components, a direct component where individuals compete in
inducing others to become like them and an indirect component where individuals
cooperate and help others who are already similar to them.

from this Small Magellanic Cloud transient, when the source luminosity was Lx ~
10$^{38}$ erg/s. A spin period of P=2.762383(5) s was derived, corresponding to
an average spin-up of $\dot{P}_{\mathrm{spin}} = -(1.27\pm0.01)\times10^{-12}$
s $s^{-1}$ from the only previous period measurement, obtained more than 20
years earlier. The time-averaged continuum spectrum (0.2-12 keV) consisted of a
hard power-law (photon index ~0.44) with an exponential cut-off at a
phase-dependent energy (20-50 keV) plus a significant soft excess below about
0.5 keV. In addition, several features were observed in the spectrum: an
emission line at 6.6 keV from highly ionized iron, a broad feature at 0.9-1 keV
likely due to a blend of Fe L-shell lines, and narrow emission and absorption
lines consistent with transitions in highly ionized oxygen, nitrogen and iron
visible in the high resolution RGS data (0.4-2.1 keV). Given the different
ionization stages of the narrow line components, indicative of photoionization
from the luminous X-ray pulsar, we argue that the soft excess in RX

merger of two compact objects for short bursts and the explosion of a massive
star for long bursts. Further classifying the long GRBs might give tighter
constraints on their progenitor and on the emission mechanism(s). In my thesis,
I present evidence for the existence of a sub-class of long GRBs, based on
their faint afterglow emission. These bursts were named low-luminosity
afterglow (LLA) GRBs. I discuss the data analysis and the selection method, and
their main properties are described. Their link to supernova is strong as 64%
of all the bursts firmly associated to SNe are LLA GRBs. Finally, I present
additional properties of LLA GRBs: the study of their rate density, which seems
to indicate a new distinct third class of events, the properties of their host
galaxies, which show that they take place in young star-forming galaxies.
Additionally, I show that it is difficult to reconcile all differences between
normal long GRBs and LLA GRBs only by considering instrumental or environmental
effects, a different ejecta content or a different geometry for the burst.
Thus, I conclude that LLA GRBs and normal long GRBs should have different
properties. I indicate that a binary system is favored in the case of LLA GRB.
The argument is based on the initial mass function of massive stars, on the
larger rate density of LLA GRBs compared to the rate of normal long GRBs and on
the type of accompanying SNe.

only minor differences, by at most ~30-50 K, compared to models calculated at
constant solar alpha(ml). The depth of the convective regions is essentially
the same in both cases. We have also analyzed the role played by the
hydro-calibrated T(tau) relationships in determining the evolution of the model
effective temperatures, when compared to alternative T(tau) relationships often
used in stellar model computations. The choice of the T(tau) can have a larger
impact than the use of a variable alpha(ml) compared to a constant solar value.
We found that the solar semi-empirical T(tau) by Vernazza et al. (1981)
provides stellar model effective temperatures that agree quite well with the
results with the hydro-calibrated relationships.

in the diffusion and anomalous diffusion limit. When the equilibrium
distribution function is a Maxwellian distribution, it is well known that for
an appropriate time scale, the small mean free path limit gives rise to a
diffusion type equation. However, when a heavy-tailed distribution is
considered, another time scale is required and the small mean free path limit
leads to a fractional anomalous diffusion equation. Our aim is to develop
numerical schemes for the original kinetic model which works for the different
regimes, without being restricted by stability conditions of standard explicit
time integrators. First, we propose some numerical schemes for the diffusion
asymptotics; then, their extension to the anomalous diffusion limit is studied.
In this case, it is crucial to capture the effect of the large velocities of
the heavy-tailed equilibrium, so that some important transformations of the
schemes derived for the diffusion asymptotics are needed. As a result, we
obtain numerical schemes which enjoy the Asymptotic Preserving property in the
anomalous diffusion limit, that is: they do not suffer from the restriction on
the time step and they degenerate towards the fractional diffusion limit when
the mean free path goes to zero. We also numerically investigate the uniform
accuracy and construct a class of numerical schemes satisfying this property.
Finally, the efficiency of the different numerical schemes is shown through
numerical experiments.

by the amplitude of initial fluctuations of spatial curvature at the last

range for all voids, but at a faster rate in voids with $\Lambda$CDM and open

atrial fibrillation (AF), clinical evidence demonstrating a heart rate target
is lacking. Aim of the present study was to run a mathematical model simulating
AF episodes with a different heart rate (HR) to predict hemodynamic parameters
for each situation.
  Methods. The lumped model, representing the pumping heart together with
systemic and pulmonary circuits, was run to simulate AF with HR of 50, 70, 90,
110 and 130 bpm, respectively.
  Results. Left ventricular pressure increased by 56.7%, from 33.92+-37.56 mmHg
to 53.15+-47.56 mmHg, and mean systemic arterial pressure increased by 27.4%,
from 82.66+-14.04 mmHg to 105.29+-7.63 mmHg, at the 50 and 130 bpm simulations,
respectively. Stroke volume (from 77.45+-8.5 to 39.09+-8.08 mL), ejection
fraction (from 61.1+-4.4 to 39.32+-5.42%) and stroke work (SW, from 0.88+-0.04
to 0.58+-0.09 J) decreased by 49.5, 35.6 and 34.2%, at the 50 and 130 bpm
simulations, respectively. In addition, oxygen consumption indexes (rate
pressure product, RPP, tension time index per minute, TTI/min, and pressure
volume area per minute, PVA/min) increased from the 50 to the 130 bpm
simulation, respectively, by 185.7% (from 5598+-1939 to 15995+-3219 mmHg/min),
55.5% (from 2094+-265 to 3257+-301 mmHg s/min) and 102.4% (from 57.99+-17.9 to
117.37+-25.96 J/min). In fact, left ventricular efficiency (SW/PVA) decreased
from 80.91+-2.91% at 50 bpm to 66.43+-3.72% at the 130 bpm HR simulation.
  Conclusion. Awaiting compulsory direct clinical evidences, the present
mathematical model suggests that lower HRs during permanent AF relates to
improved hemodynamic parameters, cardiac efficiency, and lower oxygen
consumption.

Augmenting the fine details on the coarse mesh is done via a final optimization
step. Note that the method does not provide a generic solution for multi-view
photometric stereo problem but it relaxes several common assumptions of this
problem. The approach scales very well in size given its piecewise nature,
dealing with large scale optimization and with severe missing data. Experiments

The main goal of this study is to detect the stellar overdensity

the physical parameters derived from Str\""omgren photometric data to compute
the surface density distribution as a function of galactocentric distance for
different samples of intermediate young stars. The radial distribution of the
interstellar absorption has also been derived. Results. We detected the Perseus
arm stellar overdensity at 1.6+-0.2 kpc from the Sun with a significance of
4-5{\sigma} and a surface density amplitude of around 10%, slightly depending
on the sample used. Values for the radial scale length of the Galactic disk
have been simultaneously fitted obtaining values in the range [2.9,3.5] kpc for
the population of the B4-A1 stars. Moreover, the interstellar visual absorption
distribution is congruent with a dust layer in front of the Perseus arm.
Conclusions. This is the first time that the presence of the Perseus arm
stellar overdensity has been detected through individual star counts, and its
location matches a variation in the dust distribution. The offset between the
dust lane and the overdensity indicates that the Perseus arm is placed inside
the co-rotation radius of the Milky Way spiral pattern.

then explored by working within an extended phase space. Applications to the

  Systems","30 pages, 5 figures, submitted for possible journal publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study RF-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) via energy beamforming,
from a multi-antenna energy transmitter (ET) to multiple energy receivers (ERs)
in a backscatter communication system, such as RFID, where each ER (or RFID
tag) reflects back a portion of the incident signal to the ET (or RFID reader).
For such a system, the acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER)
state information (F-CSI) at the ET is challenging, since the ERs are typically
too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feed back the F-CSI. The ET
leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel
(i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze
the harvested energy obtained by using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we
optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for
different energy beams, for weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization and
proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For WET to single ER, we obtain
the optimal channel-training energy in a semi-closed form. For WET to multiple
ERs, the optimal WET scheme for WSE maximization is shown to use only one
energy beam. For PFE maximization, we show it is a biconvex problem, and
propose a block-coordinate-descent based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal
solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the
harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10%, compared to that
obtained by using the perfect F-CSI. Hence, energy beamforming by using the
estimated BS-CSI is promising, as the complexity and energy requirement is
shifted from the ERs to the ET.

However, the computational cost of the lifted analysis still depends inherently

the worst case). For a large number of features, the lifted analysis may be too
costly or even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce variability abstractions
defined as Galois connections and use abstract interpretation as a formal

lifted analyses of SPL programs, which are sound by construction. Moreover,

the horizontal magnetic gradient (GM), defined between two opposite polarity
spots, to all spots within an appropriately defined region close to the
magnetic neutral line of an active region. This novel approach is not limited
to searching for the largest GM of two single spots as in previous methods.
Instead, the pre-flare conditions of the evolution of spot groups is captured
by the introduction of the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient, or W_GM. This
new proxy enables the potential of forecasting flares stronger than M5. The
improved capability includes (i) the prediction of flare onset time and (ii) an
assessment whether a flare is followed by another event within about 18 hours.
The prediction of onset time is found to be more accurate here. A linear
relationship is established between the duration of converging motion and the
time elapsed from the moment of closest position to that of the flare onset of
opposite polarity spot groups. The other promising relationship is between the
maximum of the W_GM prior to flaring and the value of W_GM at the moment of the
initial flare onset in the case of multiple flaring. We found that when the
W_GM decreases by about 54%, then there is no second flare. If, however, when
the W_GM decreases less than 42%, then there will be likely a follow-up flare
stronger than M5. This new capability may be useful for an automated flare
prediction tool.

this becomes important in simulations for circular machines over millions of
turns as it may induce artificial diffusion of the beam.
  In this work, we present a modeling of numerical noise induced by PIC

of particle tracking and noise created by PIC algorithms leads to correlated or
decorrelated numerical noise. For decorrelated numerical noise we derive a
scaling law for the simulation parameters, allowing an estimate of artificial

differs from the common assumption that tin segregates into nano-clusters
embedded in the lithia matrix. With this model we are able to account for the
various tin bonds that are seen experimentally and explain the three volume
expansion phases that occur when SnO undergoes lithiation: (i) at low
concentrations Li behaves as an intercalated species inducing small volume
increases; (ii) for intermediate concentrations SnO transforms into lithia
causing a large expansion; (iii) finally, as the Li concentration further
increases a saturation of the lithia takes place until a layered Li$_2$O is
formed. A moderate volume expansion results from this last process. We also
report a 'zipper' nucleation mechanism that could provide the seed for the
transformation from tin oxide to lithium oxide.

network layers has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the
theoretical frameworks developed so far apply only to special models in the
limit of infinite sizes. These methods are therefore of little help in
practical contexts, given that real interconnected networks have finite size
and their structures are generally not compatible with those of graph toy
models. Here, we introduce a theoretical method that takes as inputs the
adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the
interconnected network, without the need of actually simulating any percolation
process. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in arbitrary
interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these system into
uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the
layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected
network undergoes a continuous percolation transition. Conversely, if the
intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition
becomes abrupt even in systems of finite size. We provide examples of real
systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing a core of ""high

a passive eavesdropper intends to intercept the communication between a base
station (BS) and multiple secure users (SU) over Rayleigh fading channels. In
order to guarantee the security of information transfer, physical layer
security is employed accordingly. For such a multiple user (MU) secure network,
the number of accessing SUs, namely transmission mode, has a great impact on
the secrecy performance. Specifically, on the one hand, a large number of
accessing SUs will arise high inter-user interference at SUs, resulting in a
reduction of the capacity of the legitimate channel. On the other hand, high
inter-user interference will interfere with the eavesdropper and thus degrades
the performance of the eavesdropper channel. Generally speaking, the harmful
inter-user interference may be transformed as a useful tool of
anti-eavesdropping. The focus of this paper is on selecting the optimal
transmission mode according to channel conditions and system parameters, so as
to maximize the sum secrecy outage capacity. Moreover, through asymptotic
analysis, we present several simple mode selection schemes in some extreme
cases. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
mode selection schemes in MU secure communications.

down-conversion pattern while the other crystal, bismuth triborate (BiBO)
produces an elliptical pattern. We show this difference is due to the
angle-independent refractive index experienced by the daughter photons in BBO,
while they experience an angle-dependent refractive index in BiBO. We image the
transverse spatial profile of the generated light to determine the eccentricity
produced by each crystal and develop a model to explain our observation. Among
other things, this model predicts that there is a wavelength for which the
eccentricity from BiBO is nearly zero. Finally, we discuss how the elliptical
ring pattern produced in BiBO potentially affects polarization entanglement for
experimental setups that collect biphotons around the entire down-conversion
ring. We show that the quality of polarization entanglement as measured by the
overlap integral of the spectrum of the two rings, can remain high (>99.4%)
around the entire ring at the expense of decreased biphoton rate.

spatially growing wave is excited instead with the growth rate small compared
to that of the standing wave in a periodic system. The approximate expression

rational Liouville potentials (RLPs) starting from the so-called
""Gauss-reference"" (GRef) potentials exactly quantized on the line via classical
Jacobi, classical (generalized) Laguerre, or Romanovski-Routh polynomials with
energy-dependent indexes. Each RLP is obtained by means of the Liouville
transformation (LT) of the appropriate rational canonical Sturm-Liouville
equation (RCSLE) with second-order poles. The presented analysis takes
advantage of the generic factorization of canonical Sturm-Liouville equations
(CSLEs) in terms of intertwining ""generalized"" Darboux operators. We refer to
the latter operators as the canonical Liouville-Darboux transformations (CLDTs)
to stress that they are equivalent to three-step operations: i) the LT from the
CSLE to the Schrodinger equation; ii) the Darboux transformation (DT) of the
appropriate LP; and iii) the inverse LT from the Schrodinger equation to the
new CSLE. It is proven that the CLDT preserves the rational form of the RCSLE
if its factorization function (FF) is an almost-everywhere holomorphic (AEH)
solution of the RCSLE (or, in other words, a solution with a rational
logarithmic derivative). As explained in the paper there are up to four gauge
transformations which convert each RCSLE of our interest into the second-order
differential equations with energy-dependent polynomial coefficients. The most
important result of the paper is that polynomial solutions of these equations
belong to sequences of Heine polynomials obtained by varying free terms at
fixed values of singular points and the appropriate characteristic exponents.
This allows us to construct networks of polynomial solutions -- the so-called
""r-, c-, or i-Gauss-seed"" (r-, c-, or i-GS) Heine polynomials -- starting from
Jacobi, (generalized) Laguerre or Routh polynomials, respectively.

dynamics in order to understand the circumstances which favour its emergence
and development in large fractions of the general public. Our model is based on
the bounded confidence hypothesis and on the evolution of initially
anti-conformist agents to extreme positions.
  Numerical analyses demonstrate that a few anti-conformists are able to drag a
large fraction of conformists agents to their position provided that they
express their views more often than the conformists. The most influential
parameter controlling the outcome of the dynamics is the uncertainty of the
conformist agents; the higher their uncertainty, the higher is the influence of
anti-conformists. Systematic scans of the parameter space show the existence of
two regime transitions, one following the conformists uncertainty parameter and
the other one following the anti-conformism strength.

triple independently appears with probability $p$, consider the following graph
process. We start with the star $G_0$ on the same vertex set, containing all
the edges incident to some vertex $v_0$, and repeatedly add an edge $xy$ if
there is a vertex $z$ such that $xz$ and $zy$ are already in the graph and $xzy
\in H$. We say that the process propagates if it reaches the complete graph
before it terminates. In this paper we prove that the threshold probability for
propagation is $p=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$. We conclude that
$p=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$ is an upper bound for the threshold probability that a
random 2-dimensional simplicial complex is simply connected.

is proposed. The model is based on a number of fitting parameters depending on
bias conditions by third order polynomials. The model includes three thermal
parameters describing CNTFET behaviour in terms of saturation drain current,
threshold voltage and M exponent in the knee region versus the temperature. To
confirm the validity of the proposed thermal model, the simulations were
performed in very different thermal conditions, obtaining I-V characteristics
perfectly coincident with those of other models. The very low CPU calculation
time makes the proposed model particularly suitable to be implemented in CAD
applications.

  semi-Markov approach",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.data-an q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a statistical approach to tornadoes modeling for predicting and
simulating occurrences of tornadoes and accumulated cost distributions over a
time interval. This is achieved by modeling the tornadoes intensity, measured
with the Fujita scale, as a stochastic process. Since the Fujita scale divides
tornadoes intensity into six states, it is possible to model the tornadoes
intensity by using Markov and semi-Markov models. We demonstrate that the
semi-Markov approach is able to reproduce the duration effect that is detected
in tornadoes occurrence. The superiority of the semi-Markov model as compared
to the Markov chain model is also affirmed by means of a statistical test of
hypothesis. As an application we compute the expected value and the variance of
the costs generated by the tornadoes over a given time interval in a given
area. he paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating that semi-Markov
models represent an effective tool for physical analysis of tornadoes as well
as for the estimation of the economic damages to human things.

Italian cities with a relevant sociological aspect: the cult of the catholic
Saints. Indeed, more than in other Countries, a high percentage of Italian
cities has a toponym coming from the name of specific Saints (hagiotoponym).
The assessment of the historical origin of each hagiotoponym is out of the
scopes of the present paper, but the link with the religious sense of Italians
seems to be clear. The statistical analysis of the economic contributions that
each hagiotoponym city provides to the Italian GDP is here performed. Such an
analysis is also based on the comparison with the overall Italian data, and it
is carried out through the computation of the Theil, Gini and
Herfindahl-Hirschman indices.

detection of life beyond the Solar System. However our planet cannot be
considered a fair sample, especially if intelligent life exists elsewhere. Just
as a person's country of origin is a biased sample among countries, so too
their planet of origin may be a biased sample among planets. The magnitude of
this effect can be substantial: over 98% of the world's population live in a
country larger than the median. In the context of a simple model where the mean
population density is invariant to planet size, we infer that a given inhabited
planet (such as our nearest neighbour) has a radius $r<1.2 r_\oplus$ (95%
confidence bound). We show that this result is likely to hold not only for
planets hosting advanced life, but also for those which harbour primitive life
forms. Further inferences may be drawn for any variable which influences
population size. For example, since population density is widely observed to
decline with increasing body mass, we conclude that most intelligent species
are expected to exceed 300kg.

antenna elements $N$ to the number $P$ of radiating sources is superior or
equal to $2$, then it is possible to choose a propagator from a set of
$n(n+1)/2-1$ operators to compute the Angles of Arrival (AoA) of the narrowband
incoming waves. This new non eigenbased approach is efficient when the Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) is moderate, and gives multitude of possibilities, that
are dependent of the random data, to construct the complex sets whose columns
are orthogonal to the signal subspace generated by the radiating sources.
Elementary examples are given for $n=3$, $n=4$ and $n=6$. The simulation
results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed
computational methods.
