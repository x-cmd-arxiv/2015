microns IRAS show that the dust properties vary in the diffuse ISM at high
Galactic latitude (1e19<NH<2.5e20 H/cm2). Our aim is to explain these
variations with changes in the ISM properties and grain evolution. Our starting
point is the latest core-mantle dust model. It consists of small aromatic-rich
carbon grains, larger amorphous carbon grains with aliphatic-rich cores and
aromatic-rich mantles, and amorphous silicates with Fe/FeS nano-inclusions
covered by aromatic-rich carbon mantles. We explore whether variations in the
radiation field or in the gas density distribution in the diffuse ISM could
explain the observations. The dust properties are also varied in terms of
mantle thickness, Fe/FeS inclusions, carbon abundance, and size distribution.
Variations in the radiation field intensity and gas density distribution cannot
explain the observed variations but radiation fields harder than the standard
ISRF may participate in creating part of them. We further show that variations
in the grain mantle thickness coupled with changes in the grain size
distribution can reproduce most of the observations. We put a limit on the
mantle thickness of the silicates (~10-15nm), and find that aromatic-rich
mantles are needed for the carbon grains (at least 5-7.5nm thick). We also find
that changes in the carbon abundance in the grains could explain part of the
observed variations. Finally, we show that varying the composition of Fe/FeS
inclusions in the silicates cannot account for the variations. With small
variations in the dust properties, we are able to explain most of the
variations in the dust emission observed by Planck-HFI in the diffuse ISM. We
also find that the small realistic changes in the dust properties that we
consider almost perfectly match the anti-correlation and scatter in the
observed beta-T relation.

  Expansion",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community detection is an important task in network analysis. A community
(also referred to as a cluster) is a set of cohesive vertices that have more
connections inside the set than outside. In many social and information
networks, these communities naturally overlap. For instance, in a social
network, each vertex in a graph corresponds to an individual who usually
participates in multiple communities. In this paper, we propose an efficient
overlapping community detection algorithm using a seed expansion approach. The
key idea of our algorithm is to find good seeds, and then greedily expand these
seeds based on a community metric. Within this seed expansion method, we
investigate the problem of how to determine good seed nodes in a graph. In
particular, we develop new seeding strategies for a personalized PageRank
clustering scheme that optimizes the conductance community score. Experimental
results show that our seed expansion algorithm outperforms other
state-of-the-art overlapping community detection methods in terms of producing
cohesive clusters and identifying ground-truth communities. We also show that
our new seeding strategies are better than existing strategies, and are thus
effective in finding good overlapping communities in real-world networks.

has been widely used. Despite its success it fails to account for various
phenomena expected from Quantum-Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). We suggest a
straightforward extension of tdBAG in order to take the dynamical breaking of
chiral symmetry and the influence of vector interactions explicitly into
account. As for tdBAG the model mimics confinement in a phenomenological
approach. It is based on an analysis of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at
finite density. Furthermore, we demonstrate how NJL and bag models in this
regime follow from the more general and QCD based framework of Dyson-Schwinger
(DS) equations in medium by assuming a simple gluon contact interaction. Based
on our simple and novel model, we construct quark hadron hybrid equations of
state (EoS) and study systematically chiral and deconfinement phase
transitions, the appearance of $s$-quarks and the role of vector interaction.
We further study these aspects for matter in beta-equilibrium at zero
temperature, with particular focus on the current ~2 solar masses maximum mass
constraint for neutron stars. Our approach indicates that the currently only
theoretical evidence for the hypothesis of stable strange matter is an artifact
of tdBAG and results from neglecting the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry.

optical to GeV energy range. Previous analysis on the prompt phase revealed
similarities with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) bursts observed by Fermi: i) a
delayed onset of the high-energy emission ($> 100$ MeV), ii) a short-lasting
bright peak at later times and iii) a temporally extended component from this
phase and lasting hundreds of seconds. Additionally to the prompt phase,
multiwavelength observations over different epochs showed that the spectral
energy distribution was better fitted by a wind afterglow model. We present a
leptonic model based on an early afterglow that evolves in a stellar wind of
its progenitor. We apply this model to interpret the temporally extended LAT
emission and the brightest LAT peak exhibited by the prompt phase of GRB
110731A. Additionally, using the same set of parameters, we describe the
multiwavelength afterglow observations. The origin of the temporally extended
LAT, X-ray and optical flux is explained through synchrotron radiation from the
forward shock and the brightest LAT peak is described evoking the synchrotron
self-Compton emission from the reverse shock. The bulk Lorentz factor required
in this model ($\Gamma\simeq520$) lies in the range of values demanded for most
LAT-detected gamma-ray bursts. We show that the strength of the magnetic field
in the reverse-shock region is $\sim$ 50 times stronger than in the
forward-shock region. This result suggests that for GRB 110731A, the central
engine is likely entrained with strong magnetic fields.

aim to capture a small asteroid a few meters in size and redirect it into an
orbit around the Moon. There it can be investigated at leisure by astronauts
aboard an Orion or other spacecraft. The target for the mission has not yet
been selected, and there are very few potential targets currently known. Though
sufficiently small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are thought to be numerous, they
are also difficult to detect and characterize with current observational
facilities. Here we collect the most up-to-date information on the smallest
known near-Earth asteroids to outline the properties of these small NEAs as
currently understood, in order to examine what the eventual ARM target might be
like. Observational biases certainly mean that our sample is not an ideal
representation of the true population of small NEAs. However our sample is
representative of the eventual target list for the ARM mission, which will be
compiled under very similar observational constraints unless dramatic changes
are made to the way near-Earth asteroids are searched for and studied.
  We find that the typical rotation period is 40 minutes. The mean and median
axis ratios were 1.43 and 1.29. Rotation rates much faster than the spin
barrier are seen, reaching below 30 seconds, and implying that most of these
bodies are monoliths. Non-principal axis rotation is uncommon. Axial ratios
often reach values as high as two, though no undisputed results reach above
three. We find little correlation of axis ratio with size. The most common
spectral type in the sample of small NEAs is S-type (> 90%), with only a
handful of C and X types known.

that the combination of time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
methods with quantum trajectories can be used to fully address possible
experimental limitations due to decoherence, and demonstrate that the magnetic
correlations are robust for experimentally realizable ramp speeds. Using a
microscopic master equation treatment of light scattering in the many-particle
system, we test the robustness of adiabatic state preparation against
decoherence. Due to different ground-state symmetries, we also find a
metastable state with xy-ferromagnetic order if the ramp crosses to regimes
where the ground state is a z-ferromagnet. The bosonic spin Mott phase as the
initial gapped state for adiabatic cooling has many features in common with a
fermionic band insulator, but the use of bosons should enable experiments with
substantially lower initial entropies.

to clarify the {\em muon--neutrino disappearance} measurements at short
baselines in order to put severe constraints to models with more than the
three--standard neutrinos. To this aim the current FNAL--Booster neutrino beam
for a Short--Baseline experiment was carefully evaluated by considering the use
of magnetic spectrometers at two sites, near and far ones. The detector
locations were studied, together with the achievable performances of two
OPERA--like spectrometers. The study was constrained by the availability of
existing hardware and a time--schedule compatible with the undergoing project
of multi--site Liquid--Argon detectors at FNAL.
  The settled physics case and the kind of proposed experiment on the Booster
neutrino beam would definitively clarify the existing tension between the
$\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance and the $\nu_e$ appearance/disappearance at the eV
mass scale. In the context of neutrino oscillations the measurement of
$\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance is a robust and fast approach to either reject or
discover new neutrino states at the eV mass scale. We discuss an experimental
program able to extend by more than one order of magnitude (for neutrino
disappearance) and by almost one order of magnitude (for antineutrino
disappearance) the present range of sensitivity for the mixing angle between
standard and sterile neutrinos. These extensions are larger than those achieved

currently most widely used approach to build Recommendation System. CF
techniques uses the user behavior in form of user item ratings as their
information source for prediction. There are major challenges like sparsity of
rating matrix and growing nature of data which is faced by CF algorithms. These
challenges are been well taken care by Matrix Factorization. In this paper we
attempt to present an overview on the role of different MF model to address the
challenges of CF algorithms, which can be served as a roadmap for research in
this area.

gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers, using data from the physical
environmental monitors (PEM). The objective of the regression analysis is to
predict environmental noise in the gravitational-wave channel from the PEM
measurements. One of the most promising regression method is based on the
construction of Wiener-Kolmogorov filters. Using this method, the seismic noise
cancellation from the LIGO GW channel has already been performed. In the
presented approach the Wiener-Kolmogorov method has been extended,
incorporating banks of Wiener filters in the time-frequency domain,
multi-channel analysis and regulation schemes, which greatly enhance the
versatility of the regression analysis. Also we presents the first results on
regression of the bi-coherent noise in the LIGO data.

mechanism which classify unstructured data into organized form which helps user
to easily access required data. Classification techniques over big

two different expressions for the covariance of the stochastic chemical

compare both of them to predictions of the chemical Master Equation for
homogeneous well-mixed systems close to and far from thermodynamic equilibrium.
We develop a numerical scheme for inhomogeneous reactive flows, based on our
previous methods for non-reactive mixtures [K. Balakrishnan, A. L. Garcia, A.
Donev and J. B. Bell, Phys. Rev. E 89:013017, 2014]. We study the suppression
of non-equilibrium long-ranged correlations of concentration fluctuations by
chemical reactions, as well as the enhancement of pattern formation by
spontaneous fluctuations. Good agreement with available theory demonstrates
that the formulation is robust and a useful tool in the study of fluctuations
in reactive multi-species fluids. At the same time, several problems with
Langevin formulations of stochastic chemistry are identified, suggesting that
future work should examine combining Langevin and Master Equation descriptions
of hydrodynamic and chemical fluctuations.

and cosmology. In addition to cosmological measurements based on two-point
statistics, the neutrino mass can also be estimated by observations of neutrino
wakes resulting from the relative motion between dark matter and neutrinos.
Such a detection relies on an accurate reconstruction of the dark
matter-neutrino relative velocity which is affected by non-linear structure
growth and galaxy bias. We investigate our ability to reconstruct this relative
velocity using large N-body simulations where we evolve neutrinos as distinct
particles alongside the dark matter. We find that the dark matter velocity
power spectrum is overpredicted by linear theory whereas the neutrino velocity
power spectrum is underpredicted. The magnitude of the relative velocity
observed in the simulations is found to be lower than what is predicted in
linear theory. Since neither the dark matter nor the neutrino velocity fields
are directly observable from galaxy or 21 cm surveys, we test the accuracy of a
reconstruction algorithm based on halo density fields and linear theory.
Assuming prior knowledge of the halo bias, we find that the reconstructed
relative velocities are highly correlated with the simulated ones with
correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.93, 0.91 and 0.88 for neutrinos of mass
0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 eV. We confirm that the relative velocity field
reconstructed from large scale structure observations such as galaxy or 21 cm
surveys can be accurate in direction and, with appropriate scaling, magnitude.

the HST samples of ~190,000 galaxies at z=0-10. Our HST samples consist of
176,152 photo-z galaxies at z=0-6 from the 3D-HST+CANDELS catalogue and 10,454
LBGs at z=4-10 identified in CANDELS, HUDF09/12, and HFF parallel fields,
providing the largest data set to date for galaxy size evolution studies. We
derive r_e with the same technique over the wide-redshift range of z=0-10,
evaluating the optical-to-UV morphological K-correction and the selection bias
of photo-z galaxies+LBGs as well as the cosmological surface brightness dimming
effect. We find that r_e values at a given luminosity significantly decrease
towards high-z, regardless of statistics choices. For star-forming galaxies,
there is no evolution of the power-law slope of the size-luminosity relation
and the median Sersic index (n~1.5). Moreover, the r_e-distribution is well
represented by log-normal functions whose standard deviation \sigma_{\ln{r_e}}
does not show significant evolution within the range of
\sigma_{\ln{r_e}}~0.45-0.75. We calculate the stellar-to-halo size ratio from
our r_e measurements and the dark-matter halo masses estimated from the
abundance matching study, and obtain a nearly constant value of
r_e/r_vir=1.0-3.5% at z=0-8. The combination of the r_e-distribution
shape+standard deviation, the constant r_e/r_vir, and n~1.5 suggests a picture
that typical high-z star-forming galaxies have disk-like stellar components in
a sense of dynamics and morphology over cosmic time of z~0-6. If high-z
star-forming galaxies are truly dominated by disks, the r_e/r_vir value and the
disk formation model indicate that the specific angular momentum of the disk
normalized by the host halo is j_d/m_d=0.5-1. These are statistical results for
galaxies' major stellar components, and the detailed study of clumpy
sub-components is presented in the paper II.

Galois cover of the BPS spectrum of a different 4d N=2 model. The Galois group
G acts as a physical symmetry of the covering N=2 model. The simplest instance
is SU(2) SQCD with N_f=2 quarks, whose BPS spectrum is a Z_2-cover of the BPS
spectrum of pure SYM. More generally, N=2 SYM with simply--laced gauge group
admits Z_k-covers for all k; e.g. the Z_2-cover of SO(8) SYM is SO(8) SYM
coupled to two copies of the E_6 Minahan-Nemeshanski SCFT. Galois covers
simplify considerably the computation of the BPS spectrum at G-symmetric
points, in both finite and infinite chambers. When the covering and quotient
QFTs admit a geometric engineering, say for class S models, the categorical
spectral cover may be realized as a covering map in the geometry. A
particularly nice instance is when the spectral Galois cover is induced by a
modular cover of principal modular curves, X(NM)-> X(M), or, more generally, by
regular Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants; the BPS spectra of the corresponding
N=2 QFTs have magic properties. The Galois covers allow to study effectively
the action of the quantum (half)monodromy of 4d N=2 QFTs. We present several
examples and applications of the spectral covering philosophy.

low-mass main-sequence stars. Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to
constrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their
properties evolve with time on the main-sequence.
  Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed
rotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters
in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar
mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed
in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the
main-sequence.
  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters
as $\dot{M}_\star \propto R_\star^2 \Omega_\star^{1.33} M_\star^{-3.36}$. We
estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is
an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to
the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of
this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the
spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at
a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age.
  Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution
of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of
stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the
sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions,
these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution
of planetary environments.

field direction) circularly polarized Alfven waves that are almost free of
dissipation, and due to being circularly polarized exhibit no spatial variation
of magnetic field strength. Following interaction with the SNR shock with
nonzero obliquity, these parallel waves become obliquely propagating, due the
the wave refraction (different in principle for the different plane wave
components), and dissipation sets in. The magnetosonic polarization decays
faster, due to transit time damping, leaving only the Alfven mode. This
surviving mode now exhibits a spatial variation of the magnetic field, leading
to local maxima and minima in the synchrotron emission, i.e. the stripes. We
attribute the initial wave generation to the Bell instability, which in
contrast to the resonant generation of upstream Alfven waves, gives rise to a
preferred wavelength, and hence the single wave period at which the stripes are
seen. Based on estimates for damping rates due to turbulent cascade and transit
time damping, we estimate the dependence of the visibility of the stripes on
the shock obliquity, and determine a maximum cosmic ray energy in Tycho's SNR

This is understood to derive at least in part from some active process that
magnifies vibrations of the basilar membrane (BM) and the cochlear partition in
which it is embedded, to the extent that it overcomes the effect of viscous
damping from the surrounding cochlear fluid. Many authors have associated this
amplification ability to some type of mechanical resonance within the cochlea,
however there is still no consensus regarding the precise cause of
amplification. Our work is inspired by experiments showing that the outer hair
cells within the cochlear partition change their lengths when stimulated, which
can in turn cause periodic distortions of the BM and other structures in the
cochlea. This paper investigates a novel fluid-mechanical resonance mechanism
that derives from hydrodynamic interactions between an oscillating BM and the
surrounding cochlear fluid. We present a model of the cochlea based on the
immersed boundary method, in which a small-amplitude periodic internal forcing
due to outer hair cells can induce parametric resonance. A Floquet stability
analysis of the linearized equations demonstrates the existence of resonant
(unstable) solutions within the range of physical parameters corresponding to
the human auditory system. Numerical simulations of the immersed boundary
equations support the analytical results and clearly demonstrate the existence
of resonant solution modes. These results are then used to illustrate the
influence of parametric resonance on wave propagation along the BM and explicit
comparisons are drawn with results from another two-dimensional cochlea model.

an effective interaction potential that can be used to study the assembly of

interaction is obtained best from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on a
density functional approach, this study proposes three methods of predicting
the PMF for any temperature based on a single molecular dynamics simulation for
one temperature. The three methods construct the PMF by considering the ligands
as an ideal gas, as hard-sphere chains, or as Lennard-Jones interaction sites.
To apply this methodology, the density of the interaction centers must be
extracted from the simulation data. For the ideal gas model, a straightforward
sampling procedure with a fixed lattice in space leads to free energies that
are too large in order to consistently explain the simulation data for
different temperatures. Naive sampling does not account for the small momenta
added to the NCs when coupled to a thermostat. A method is proposed that
corrects for the unphysical steps during the simulation. The ideal gas
contribution computed for the corrected density is significantly smaller than
the one obtained from naive sampling and can thus explain the temperature
dependence of the PMF correctly. For the hard-sphere chain model, where a
weighted density is used, the correction of the particle density is not
essential. However, the PMF calculated based on the corrected density confirms
our approach. All three models predict PMF curves in very good agreement with
simulation results, but they differ in the number of input parameters and the
computational effort. Based on the modeling results, we predict the existence
of an additional attractive force at small distances of the NCs - a depletion
force.

variables using only a limited number of samples. In this regard, sparse
models, e.g. the lasso, are applied to select the optimal features and achieve
high diagnosis accuracy. The lasso, however, usually results in independent
unstable features. Stability, a manifest of reproducibility of statistical
results subject to reasonable perturbations to data and the model, is an
important focus in statistics, especially in the analysis of high dimensional
data. In this paper, we explore a nonnegative generalized fused lasso model for
stable feature selection in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition
to sparsity, our model incorporates two important pathological priors: the
spatial cohesion of lesion voxels and the positive correlation between the
features and the disease labels. To optimize the model, we propose an efficient
algorithm by proving a novel link between total variation and fast network flow
algorithms via conic duality. Experiments show that the proposed nonnegative
model performs much better in exploring the intrinsic structure of data via
selecting stable features compared with other state-of-the-arts.

The aim of the study is to constrain the physics of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) by analysing the multi-wavelength afterglow data set of GRB 121024A that
covers the full range from radio to X-rays. Methods. Using multi-epoch
broad-band observations of the GRB 121024A afterglow, we measured the three
characteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum. We used six
epochs of combined XRT and GROND data to constrain the temporal slopes, the
dust extinction, the X-ray absorption, and the spectral slope with high
accuracy. Two more epochs of combined data from XRT, GROND, APEX, CARMA, and
EVLA were used to set constraints on the break frequencies and therefore on the
micro-physical and dynamical parameters. Results. The XRT and GROND light
curves show a simultaneous and achromatic break at around 49 ks. As a result,
the crossing of the synchrotron cooling break is no suitable explanation for
the break in the light curve. The multi wavelength data allow us to test two
plausible scenarios explaining the break: a jet break, and the end of energy
injection. The jet-break scenario requires a hard electron spectrum, a very low
cooling break frequency, and a non-spreading jet. The energy injection avoids
these problems, but requires $\epsilon_e > 1 (k = 2)$, spherical outflow, and
$\epsilon_B < 10^{-9}$. Conclusions. In light of the extreme microphysical
parameters required by the energy-injection model, we favour a jet-break
scenario where $\nu_m < \nu_{sa}$ to explain the observations. This scenario
gives physically meaningful microphysical parameters, and it also naturally
explains the reported detection of linear and circular polarisation.

using analytical guided wave models. The device consists of a ring resonator
fed by a directional coupler, where the ring resonator path includes a
leaky-wave antenna segment. The resonator integration provides two main
advantages: the high-quality factor ensures effective control of radiation
intensity by controlling the resonance conditions and the efficient radiation
from a leaky-wave antenna even when its length is much smaller than the
propagation length of the leaky wave. We devise an analytical model of the
guided wave propagation along a directional coupler and the ring resonator path
including the antenna and non-radiating segments. The trade-offs regarding the
quality factor of resonance and the antenna efficiency of such a design is
reported in terms of the coupler parameters, leaky-wave constant and radiation
length. Finally a CMOS-compatible OLWA design suitable for the ring resonator
integration is designed where Silicon is utilized as the waveguide material for
a possible electronic control of radiation intensity. The simulation results
together with the analytical model show that slight variations in the
leaky-wave's propagation constant, realized through excitation of excess
carriers in Si domain, is sufficient to control the far-field radiation
modulation with high extinction ratio.

to assess malaria transmission risk and predict the public health consequences
of vector control strategies. However, laboratory studies commonly demonstrate
clear evidence of senescence, or a decrease in physiological function and
increase in vector mortality rate with age. We developed methods to integrate
available field data to understand mortality in wild Anopheles gambiae, the
most import vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. We found evidence for an
increase in rates of mortality with age, a component of senescence. As
expected, we also found that overall mortality is far greater in wild cohorts
than commonly observed under protected laboratory conditions. The magnitude of
senescence increases with An. gambiae lifespan, implying that wild mosquitoes
die long before cohorts can exhibit strong senescence. We reviewed available
published mortality studies of Anopheles spp. to confirm this fundamental
prediction of aging in wild populations. Senescence becomes most apparent in
long-living mosquito cohorts, and cohorts with low extrinsic mortality, such as
those raised under protected laboratory conditions, suffer a relatively high
proportion of senescent deaths. Imprecision in estimates of vector mortality
and changes in mortality with age will severely bias models of vector borne
disease transmission risk, such as malaria, and the sensitivity of transmission
to bias increases as the extrinsic incubation period of the parasite decreases.
While we focus here on malaria, we caution that future models for
anti-vectorial interventions must therefore incorporate both realistic
mortality rates and age-dependent changes in vector mortality.

identify two parameters computed from the pre-collapse structure of the

mu4 = d(m/M_sun)/d(r/1000 km) at s=4, being the normalized mass-derivative at
this location. The two parameters mu4 and M4*mu4 can be directly linked to the
mass-infall rate, Mdot, of the collapsing star and the electron-type neutrino
luminosity of the accreting proto-NS, L_nue ~ M_ns*Mdot, which play a crucial
role in the ""critical luminosity"" concept for the theoretical description of
neutrino-driven explosions as runaway phenomenon of the stalled accretion
shock. All models were evolved employing the approach of Ugliano et al. for
simulating neutrino-driven explosions in spherical symmetry. The neutrino
emission of the accretion layer is approximated by a gray transport solver,

seven such weak emission line quasars (WLQs) at moderate redshifts (z=1.4-1.7)
using the X-shooter spectrograph, which provides simultaneous optical and
near-infrared spectroscopy covering the rest-frame ultraviolet through optical.
These new observations effectively double the number of WLQs with spectroscopy
in the optical rest-frame, and they allow us to compare the strengths of (weak)
high-ionization emission lines (e.g., CIV) to low-ionization lines (e.g., MgII,
Hb, Ha) in individual objects. We detect broad Hb and Ha emission in all
objects, and these lines are generally toward the weaker end of the
distribution expected for typical quasars (e.g., Hb has rest-frame equivalent
widths ranging from 15-40 Ang.). However, these low-ionization lines are not
exceptionally weak, as is the case for high-ionization lines in WLQs. The
X-shooter spectra also display relatively strong optical FeII emission, Hb FWHM
<4000 km/s, and significant CIV blueshifts (1000-5500 km/s) relative to the
systemic redshift; two spectra also show elevated ultraviolet FeII emission,
and an outflowing component to their (weak) MgII emission lines. These
properties suggest that WLQs are exotic versions of ""wind-dominated"" quasars.
Their BELRs either have unusual high-ionization components, or their BELRs are
in an atypical photoionization state because of an unusually soft continuum.

of the Milky Way with the onboard X-Ray Telescope using short 1-ks exposures
performed every 1-4 days. Between 2006 and 2014, over 1200 observations have
been obtained, amounting to ~1.2 Ms of exposure time. This has yielded a wealth
of information about the long-term X-ray behavior of the supermassive black
hole Sgr A*, and numerous transient X-ray binaries that are located within the
25'x25' region covered by the campaign. In this review we highlight the
discoveries made during these first nine years, which includes 1) the detection
of seven bright X-ray flares from Sgr A*, 2) the discovery of the magnetar SGR
J1745-29, 3) the first systematic analysis of the outburst light curves and
energetics of the peculiar class of very-faint X-ray binaries, 4) the discovery
of three new transient X-ray sources, 5) exposing low-level accretion in
otherwise bright X-ray binaries, and 6) the identification of a candidate X-ray
binary/millisecond radio pulsar transitional object. We also reflect on future
science to be done by continuing this Swift's legacy campaign of the Galactic
center, which includes high-cadence monitoring of how the interaction between
the gaseous object `G2' and Sgr A* plays out in the future.

true for Bell states of two bosonic modes, as well as for Bell states of a

degradation of entanglement for Bell states of fermionic modes. We reveal the

that the behavior of entanglement in accelerated frames strongly depends on the

the entangled state, where especially states $\Phi^\pm$ and $\Psi^\pm$ exhibit
distinct characteristics regarding entanglement degradation. Finally, we point
out possible implications of hovering over a black hole for these states.

Josephson structures consisting of a uniform SFFS structure and a trilayer
SFFFS configuration. Our results demonstrate that for SCs flowing perpendicular
to the FF interfaces, incorporating a conical texture yields the most effective
way to observe the signatures of the long-ranged SC. We also consider three
different types of finite-sized 2D structures subjected to an applied magnetic
field: a uniform SFS junction, and two SFFS configurations with differing FF
bilayer arrangements. In one case, the FF interface is parallel with the SF
interfaces while in the other case, the FF junction is oriented perpendicular
to the SF interfaces. For the uniform SFS junction, we analytically derive the
magnetic field induced SC and pair potential, providing insight into the
variations of the critical SCs and proximity vortices. Our extensive
computations demonstrate that the induced long-range SCs can penetrate deeply
into uniform FF bilayers when singlet SCs flow parallel to the FF interfaces

the FF interfaces. We pinpoint the origin of the induced triplet and singlet
correlations through spatial profiles of the decomposed total SCs. We find that
the penetration of the long-range SCs associated with SCs flowing parallel to

generations of stars to explain the observed chemical abundance anomalies, but
it has also been suggested that self-enrichment could occur via accretion of
ejecta from massive stars onto the circumstellar disc of low-mass pre-main
sequence stars. These scenarios imply different initial conditions for the
kinematics of the various stellar populations. Given some net angular momentum
initially, models for which a second generation forms from gas that collects in
a cooling flow into the core of the cluster predict an initially larger
rotational amplitude for the polluted stars compared to the pristine stars.
This is opposite to what is expected from the accretion model, where the
polluted stars are the ones crossing the core and are on preferentially radial
(low-angular momentum) orbits, such that their rotational amplitude is lower.
Here we present the results of a suite of $N$-body simulations with initial
conditions chosen to capture the distinct kinematic properties of these
pollution scenarios. We show that initial differences in the kinematics of
polluted and pristine stars can survive to the present epoch in the outer parts
of a large fraction of Galactic globular clusters. The differential rotation of
pristine and polluted stars is identified as a unique kinematic signature that
could allow us to distinguish between various scenarios, while other kinematic
imprints are generally very similar from one scenario to the other.

$\alpha$, is monotonically and positively correlated with the collapse redshift
of the halo. This is qualitatively similar to the findings of some previous

producing mock catalogs, and to simplify computationally intensive

framework was also extended to non-polynomial dynamical systems, including
power systems, using an algebraic reformulation technique that recasts the
system's dynamics into a set of polynomial differential algebraic equations.
Nevertheless, for large scale dynamical systems this method becomes
inapplicable due to its computational complexity. For this reason we develop a
subsystem based stability analysis approach using vector Lyapunov functions and
introduce a parallel and scalable algorithm to infer the stability of the
interconnected system with the help of the subsystem Lyapunov functions.
Furthermore, we design adaptive and distributed control laws that guarantee
asymptotic stability under a given external disturbance. Finally, we apply this
algorithm for the stability analysis and control synthesis of a network

provide closer performance to the exact method at lower values of rate-outage

For a space mission, the most interesting regions would be those that are
unstable for the prograde cases, but stable for the retrograde cases. Such
configuration provide a stable region to place the mission probe with a
relative retrograde orbit, and, at the same time, guarantees a region free of
debris since they are expected to have prograde orbits. We found that in fact
the internal and external stable regions significantly increase when compared
to the prograde case. For particles with $e=0$ and $I=180^{\circ}$, we found
that nearly the whole region around Alpha and Beta remain stable. We then
identified three internal regions and one external region that are very
interesting to place the space probe. We present the stable regions found for
the retrograde case and a discussion on those preferred regions. We also
discuss the effects of resonances of the particles with Beta and Gamma, and the

EW(C IV) is primarily anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio, a relation we

previously obtained for quasars at z < 0.5. Based on the MBE, weak emission
line quasars (WLQs), typically showing EW(C IV) <~ 10 A, are expected to have
extremely high Eddington ratios. By selecting all WLQs with archival Hbeta and
C IV spectroscopic data, nine sources in total, we find that their Hbeta-based
Eddington ratios are typical of ordinary quasars with similar redshifts and
luminosities. Four of these WLQs can be accommodated by the MBE, but the other
five deviate significantly from this relation, at the >~3 \sigma\ level, by
exhibiting C IV lines much weaker than predicted from their Hbeta-based

spectral index along the jets and a gradual steepening from the ends of the

to the integrated spectrum of the source gives an asymptotic low-frequency
index of $\alpha_{inj}=0.53_{-0.02}^{+0.01}$, while JP models fitted to the
observed spectral index trend along the lobes allow us to estimate radiative
ages of $\sim29$ Myr and $\sim37$ Myr for the west and east lobes respectively.
Our age estimates are a factor of two lower than the 75-Myr upper limit derived
from X-ray data (O'Sullivan et al. 2011). We find unlikely the scenario of an
early supersonic phase in which the lobe expanded into the ISM at approximately
Mach 6 (3500 km s$^{-1}$), and suggest that either the source underwent
multiple AGN outbursts with possible large changes in jet power, or possibly
that the source age that we find is due to a backflow that transports young
electrons from the jet tips through the lobes toward the nucleus relatively
quickly. We calculate that in the lobes the energy ratio of non-radiating to
radiating particles is $\sim4-24$ indicating significant gas entrainment. If
the lobes are in pressure balance with their surroundings, the total energy
required to heat the entrained material is $10^{58}$ erg, $\sim$40% of the

temperatures ($T$) in the range of $150\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to
$300\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. A relation between mound evolution and
large-wavelength fluctuations at CdTe surface has been established. One finds
that short-length scales are dictated by an interplay between the effects of
the formation of defects at boundaries of neighbouring grains and a relaxation
process which stems from the diffusion and deposition of particles (CdTe
molecules) torward these regions. A Kinetic Monte Carlo model corroborates
these reasonings. As $T$ is increased, the competition gives rise to different
scenarios in the roughening scaling such as: uncorrelated growth, a crossover
from random to correlated growth and transient anomalous scaling. In
particular, for $T = 250\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, one shows that surface
fluctuations are described by the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
equation, in the meantime that, the universality of height, local roughness and
maximal height distributions for the KPZ class is, finally, experimentally
demonstrated. The dynamic of fluctuations at the CdTe surface for other
temperatures still is described by the KPZ equation, but with different values
for the superficial tension ($\nu$) and excess of velocity ($\lambda$). Namely,
for $T = 150\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ one finds a Poissonian growth that indicates
$\nu = \lambda = 0$. For $T = 200\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, however, a
Random-to-KPZ crossover is found, with $\lambda > 0$ in the second regime.
Finally, for films grown at $T = 300\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, one demonstrates
that a KPZ growth with $\lambda < 0$ takes place. We discuss the different
mechanisms leading to KPZ scaling which depend on $T$, and conjecture the
behavior of the phenomenological parameter $\lambda$ as function of the
deposition temperature.

how regulatory constraints can be set within the EU-ETS in order to reach
certain political goals such as a good balance of emission reduction and
economical growth. Such regulatory constraints can be modeled as parameters
within the HJB equation.
  (2) The EU-ETS is just one example where one is interested in solving a
parameterized HJB equation often for different values of the parameters (e.g.\
to optimize their values with respect to a given target functional). The
Reduced Basis Method (RBM) is by now a well-established numerical method to
efficiently solve parameterized partial differential equations. However, to the
best of our knowledge, an RBM for the HJB equation is not known so far and of
(mathematical) interest by its own, since the HJB equation is of hyperbolic
type which is in general a nontrivial task for model reduction.
  We analyze and realize a RBM for the HJB equation. In particular, we
construct an online-efficient error estimator for this nonlinear problem using
the Brezzi-Rapaz-Raviart (RBB) theory as well as numerical algorithms for the
involved parameter-dependent constants. Numerical experiments are presented.

  Riva Shalom","Mind the Gap",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine the complexity of the online Dictionary Matching with One Gap
Problem (DMOG) which is the following. Preprocess a dictionary $D$ of $d$
patterns, where each pattern contains a special gap symbol that can match any
string, so that given a text that arrives online, a character at a time, we can
report all of the patterns from $D$ that are suffixes of the text that has
arrived so far, before the next character arrives. In more general versions the
gap symbols are associated with bounds determining the possible lengths of
matching strings. Finding efficient algorithmic solutions for (online) DMOG has
proven to be a difficult algorithmic challenge. We demonstrate that the
difficulty in obtaining efficient solutions for the DMOG problem even, in the
offline setting, can be traced back to the infamous 3SUM conjecture.
Interestingly, our reduction deviates from the known reduction paths that
follow from 3SUM. In particular, most reductions from 3SUM go through the
set-disjointness problem, which corresponds to the problem of preprocessing a
graph to answer edge-triangles queries. We use a new path of reductions by
considering the complementary, although structurally very different,
vertex-triangles queries. Using this new path we show a conditional lower bound
of $\Omega(\delta(G_D)+op)$ time per text character, where $G_D$ is a bipartite
graph that captures the structure of $D$, $\delta(G_D)$ is the degeneracy of
this graph, and $op$ is the output size. We also provide matching upper-bounds
(up to sub-polynomial factors) for the vertex-triangles problem, and then
extend these techniques to the online DMOG problem. In particular, we introduce
algorithms whose time cost depends linearly on $\delta(G_D)$. Our algorithms
make use of graph orientations, together with some additional techniques.
Finally, when $\delta(G_D)$ is large we are able to obtain even more efficient
solutions.

the droplets exit the hopper via intermittent avalanches. At the highest flow

of behaviors is a fairly smooth function of the mean strain rate. The
avalanches are characterized by a power law distribution of the time interval
between droplets exiting the hopper, with long intervals between the

by adding a flexible compliance to the system. The compliance results in
continuous flow at high flow rates, and allows the system to clog at low flow

scalar and vector potentials of the harmonic coordinates, where $\phi$ is the
usual corrector, grows sublinearly in a mildly quantified way. We then
construct ""$k$th-order correctors"" and thereby the space of $a$-harmonic

observable universe emerges from a tunnelling event and that the relevant
features originate purely from inflationary dynamics, we find that the power
spectrum not only contains information on single-field dynamics, but also
places strong con- straints on all scalar fields present in the theory. We find
that the simplest single-field models giving rise to power suppression do not
generalise to multifield models in a straightforward way, as the resulting
superhorizon evolution of the curvature perturbation tends to erase any power
suppression present at horizon crossing. On the other hand, multifield effects
do present a means of generating power suppression which to our knowledge has
so far not been considered. We propose a mechanism to illustrate this, which we
dub flume inflation.

whose characters arise in the continuum scaling limits of certain transfer
matrices in logarithmic minimal models, described using Temperley-Lieb
algebras. The lattice transfer operators include seams on the boundary that use
Wenzl-Jones projectors. If the projectors are singular, the original
prescription is to select a subspace of the Temperley-Lieb modules on which the
action of the transfer operators is non-singular. However, this prescription
does not, in general, yield representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebras and
the Virasoro Kac modules have remained largely unidentified. Here, we introduce
the appropriate algebraic framework for the lattice analysis as a quotient of
the one-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra. The corresponding standard modules are
introduced and examined using invariant bilinear forms and their Gram
determinants. The structures of the Virasoro Kac modules are inferred from
these results and are found to be given by finitely generated submodules of
Feigin-Fuchs modules. Additional evidence for this identification is obtained
by comparing the formalism of lattice fusion with the fusion rules of the
Virasoro Kac modules. These are obtained, at the character level, in complete
generality by applying a Verlinde-like formula and, at the module level, in
many explicit examples by applying the Nahm-Gaberdiel-Kausch fusion algorithm.

operads, a general monad-theoretic context for speaking about structures within
structures is presented, and the problem of constructing the universal ambient
structure containing the prescribed internal structure is studied. Following
the work of Lack, these universal objects must be constructed from simplicial
objects arising from our monad-theoretic framework, as certain 2-categorical
colimits called codescent objects. We isolate the extra structure present on
these simplicial objects which enable their codescent objects to be computed.
These are the crossed internal categories of the title, and generalise the
crossed simplicial groups of Loday and Fiedorowicz. The most general results of
this article are concerned with how to compute such codescent objects in
2-categories of internal categories, and on isolating conditions on the
monad-theoretic situation which enable these results to apply. Combined with
earlier work of the author in which operads are seen as polynomial 2-monads,
our results are then applied to the theory of non-symmetric, symmetric and
braided operads. In particular, the well-known construction of a PROP from an
operad is recovered, as an illustration of our techniques.

The control signals comprising of CSI and the precoding weights can easily
overwhelm the backhaul resources. Relative thresholding has been proposed to
alleviate the burden; however, this is at the cost of reduction in throughput.
In this paper, we propose utilizing the long term channel statistics comprising
of pathloss and shadow fading in the precoder design to model the statistical
interference for the unknown CSI. In this regard, a successive second order
cone programming (SSOCP) based precoder for maximizing the weighted sum rate is
proposed. The accuracy of the solution obtained is bounded with the branch and
bound technique. An alternative optimization framework via weighted mean square
error minimization is also derived. Both these approaches provide an efficient
solution close to the optimal, and also achieve efficient backhauling, in a
sense that the precoding weights are generated only for the active links. For
comparison, a stochastic approach based on particle swarm optimization is also
considered.

of selected such 55 red giants in the Kepler field with precisely known seismic
parameters (among which parallaxes are available for 9 stars), we checked the
accuracy of the determination method of stellar parameters previously applied
to many red giants by Takeda et al. (2008, PASJ, 60, 781), since it may be
possible to discriminate their complex evolutionary status by using the surface
gravity vs. mass diagram. We confirmed that our spectroscopic gravity and the
seismic gravity satisfactorily agree with each other (to within ~0.1 dex)
without any systematic difference. However, the mass values of He-burning red
clump giants derived from stellar evolutionary tracks (~2-3 Msun) were found to
be markedly larger by ~50% compared to the seismic values (~1-2 Msun) though
such discrepancy is not seen for normal giants in the H-burning phase, which
reflects the difficulty of mass determination from intricately overlapping
tracks on the luminosity vs. effective temperature diagram. This consequence
implies that the mass results of many red giants in the clump region determined
by Takeda et al. (2008) are likely to be significantly overestimated. We also
compare our spectroscopically established parameters with recent literature

investigation and the solutions obtained from the generic method are compared
to the analytical solutions which are obtained from the
Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch-Mooney-Schofield method. Very good agreement was
obtained in all the investigated cases. All the required quantities of the flow
which include local viscosity, rate of strain, flow velocity profile and
volumetric flow rate, as well as shear stress, can be obtained from the generic
method. This is an advantage as compared to some traditional methods which only
produce some of these quantities. The method is also superior to the numerical
meshing techniques which may be used for resolving the flow in these systems.
The method is particularly useful when analytical solutions are not available
or when the available analytical solutions do not yield all the flow
parameters.

functions of physical systems, like lattice gauge theories, in various
dimensions by associating local tensors or weights, to different parts of a
closed triangulated manifold. Here we extend this construction by including
matter fields to build partition functions in both two and three space-time
dimensions. The matter fields introduces new weights to the vertices and they
correspond to Potts spin configurations described by an $\mathcal{A}$-module
with an inner product. Performing this construction on a triangulated manifold
with a boundary we obtain the transfer matrices which are decomposed into a
product of local operators acting on vertices, links and plaquettes. The vertex
and plaquette operators are similar to the ones appearing in the quantum double
models (QDM) of Kitaev. The link operator couples the gauge and the matter
fields, and it reduces to the usual interaction terms in known models such as
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter fields. The transfer matrices lead to
Hamiltonians that are frustration-free and are exactly solvable. According to
the choice of the initial input, that of the gauge group and a matter module,
we obtain interesting models which have a new kind of ground state degeneracy
that depends on the number of equivalence classes in the matter module under
gauge action. Some of the models have confined flux excitations in the bulk
which become deconfined at the surface. These edge modes are protected by an
energy gap provided by the link operator. These properties also appear in
""confined Walker-Wang"" models which are 3D models having interesting surface
states. Apart from the gauge excitations there are also excitations in the
matter sector which are immobile and can be thought of as defects like in the
Ising model. We only consider bosonic matter fields in this paper.

selecting a pair of transmit and receive antenna at both ends for

consensus dynamics in classical or quantum networks. We show that in the
classical case, the network entropy decreases at the consensus limit if the
node initial values are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, and the network
differential entropy is monotonically non-increasing if the node initial values
are i.i.d. Gaussian. While for quantum consensus dynamics, the network's von
Neumann entropy is in contrast non-decreasing. In light of this inconsistency,
we compare several gossiping algorithms with random or deterministic
coefficients for classical or quantum networks, and show that quantum gossiping
algorithms with deterministic coefficients are physically related to classical
gossiping algorithms with random coefficients.

analyses of eight typical events' diffusion on a very large micro-blogging

impact on information spreading along with social activities. In addition, we
propose a theoretical model to interpret the spreading process via both

Experimental and mathematical results indicate that the information indeed
spreads much quicker and broader with mutual effects of the internal and

compact formulas for computing both Caputo and (modified) Riemann-Liouville
(RL) fractional pseudospectral differentiation matrices (F-PSDMs) of any order
at general Jacobi-Gauss-Lobatto (JGL) points. We show that in the Caputo case,
it suffices to compute F-PSDM of order $\mu\in (0,1)$ to compute that of any
order $k+\mu$ with integer $k\ge 0,$ while in the modified RL case, it is only
necessary to evaluate a fractional integral matrix of order $\mu\in (0,1).$
Secondly, we introduce suitable fractional JGL Birkhoff interpolation problems
leading to new interpolation polynomial basis functions with remarkable
properties: (i) the matrix generated from the new basis yields the exact
inverse of F-PSDM at ""interior"" JGL points; (ii) the matrix of the highest
fractional derivative in a collocation scheme under the new basis is diagonal;
and (iii) the resulted linear system is well-conditioned in the Caputo case,
while in the modified RL case, the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are
highly concentrated. In both cases, the linear systems of the collocation
schemes using the new basis can solved by an iterative solver within a few
iterations. Notably, the inverse can be computed in a very stable manner, so
this offers optimal preconditioners for usual fractional collocation methods
for fractional differential equations (FDEs). It is also noteworthy that the
choice of certain special JGL points with parameters related to the order of
the equations can ease the implementation. We highlight that the use of the
Bateman's fractional integral formulas and fast transforms between Jacobi
polynomials with different parameters, are essential for our algorithm

we find that 25 S0s (14%) and 24 spirals (77%) host pseudoblges. The fraction
of pseudobulges we find in spiral galaxies is consistent with previous results
obtained with optical data and show that the evolution of a large fraction of
spirals is governed by secular processes rather than by major mergers. We find
that the bulge effective radius is correlated with the disk scale length for
pseudobulges of S0s and spirals, as expected for secular formation of bulges
from disk instabilities, though the disks in S0s are significantly smaller than
those in spirals. We show that early-type pseudobulge hosting spirals can

the LAT datasets, instrument response functions and background models allow for
a more accurate analysis. Therefore it is important to re-evaluate the
previously analyzed time period along with the new data to further constrain
location, spectral shape, and flux time history of the gamma-ray source. We
confirm earlier predictions of increasing flux values above 10 GeV toward the
next periastron passage. For the most recent part of the data sample, flux
values as high as those before the first periastron passage in 2008 are
recorded. A comparison of spectral energy distributions around periastron and

to a second spectral component that is present only around periastron. Improved
spatial consistency with the gamma-ray source at the position of eta Carinae

The resulting turbulent flow saturates at an average Mach number of ~2.5 and is
analysed through density and velocity power spectra, including an investigation
of the evolution of the solenoidal and compressional components. We obtain a
shallow density power spectrum with a slope of ~-1.2 attributed to the presence
of a network of localised dense filamentary structures formed by strong shock
interactions. The total velocity power spectrum slope is found to be ~-2.0,
representative of Burgers shock dominated turbulence model. The density
weighted velocity power spectrum slope is measured as ~-1.6, slightly less than
the expected Kolmogorov scaling value (slope of -5/3) found in previous works.
The discrepancy may be caused by the nature of our real space driving model and
we suggest there is no universal scaling law for supersonic compressible
turbulence. We find that on average, solenoidal modes slightly dominate in our
turbulence model as the interaction between strong curved compressible shocks
generates solenoidal modes, and compressible modes decay faster.

ubiquitous in the literature. If the assumption of parallel lines does not hold
for the data, then an alternative is to specify a non-proportional odds (NPO)
model, where the regression parameters are allowed to vary depending on the
level of the response. However, it is often difficult to fit these models, and
challenges regarding model choice and fitting are further compounded if there
are a large number of explanatory variables. We make two contributions towards
tackling these issues: firstly, we develop a Bayesian method for fitting these
models, that ensures the stochastic ordering conditions hold for an arbitrary
finite range of the explanatory variables, allowing NPO models to be fitted to
any observed data set. Secondly, we use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte
Carlo to allow the model to choose between PO and NPO structures for each
explanatory variable, and show how variable selection can be incorporated.
These methods can be adapted for any monotonic increasing link functions. We
illustrate the utility of these approaches on novel data from a longitudinal
study of individual-level risk factors affecting body condition score in a dog
population in Zenzele, South Africa.

  2015 (typos fixed; correction in figure 1.11)",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This thesis presents a newly developed theory for the formation and
maintenance of eddy-driven jets in planetary turbulence. The novelty is that
jet formation and maintenance is studied as a dynamics of the statistics of the
flow rather than a dynamics of individual realizations. This is pursued using
Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T), which studies the closed dynamics
of the first two cumulants of the full statistical state dynamics of the flow
after neglecting or parameterizing third and higher-order cumulants. Using this
statistical closure, large-scale structure formation is studied in barotropic
turbulence on a $\beta$-plane.
  It is demonstrated that at analytically predicted critical parameter values
the homogeneous turbulent state undergoes a bifurcation becoming inhomogeneous
with the emergence of large-scale zonal and/or non-zonal flows. The mechanisms
by which the turbulent Reynolds stresses organize to reinforce infinitesimal
mean flow inhomogeneities, thus leading to this statistical state instability,
are studied for various regimes of parameter values. It is also demonstrated
that the S3T instabilities equilibrate to turbulent states with
finite-amplitude jets. Moreover, the relation between large-scale structure
formation through modulational instability and the S3T instability of the
homogeneous turbulent state is also investigated and it is shown that the
modulational instability results are subsumed by the S3T results. Finally, the
study of the S3T stability of inhomogeneous turbulent jet equilibria is
presented and the relation with the phenomenon of jet merging is investigated.
Although all these phenomena cannot be predicted by analysis of the dynamics of
single realizations of the flow, it is demonstrated that the predictions of S3T
are reflected in individual realizations of the flow.

authorized users only. One approach for specifying policies is using role based
access control (RBAC) where authorization is given to roles instead of users.
Users are assigned to roles such that each user can access all the records that
are allowed to his/her role. RBAC has a great interest because of its
flexibility. One issue in RBAC is dealing with constraints. Usually, policies
should satisfy pre-defined constraints as for example separation of duty (SOD)
which states that users are not allowed to play two conflicting roles.
Verifying the satisfiability of constraints based on policies is time consuming
and may lead to errors. Therefore, an automated verification is essential. In
this paper, we propose a theory for specifying policies and constraints in
first order logic. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive list of constraints.
We identity constraints based on the relation between users and roles, between
roles and permission on records, between users and permission on records, and
between users, roles, and permission on records. Then, we use a general purpose
theorem prover tool called Prover9 for proving the satisfaction of constraints.

the magnetic correlation length xi. The spin nematic instability occurs when xi
reaches a critical value xi_{cr}, i.e., its transition temperature T_{SN} is
always higher than the SDW critical temperature T_{SDW}. In particular, xi_{cr}
decreases monotonically with increasing T_{SN}. Concomitantly, low-energy
nematic fluctuations are present in a wider temperature region as T_{SN}
becomes higher. Approaching the spin nematic instability, the nematic spectral
function at zero momentum exhibits a central peak as a function of energy for a
finite temperature and a soft mode at zero temperature. These properties
originate from the general feature that the imaginary part of the
spin-fluctuation bubble has a term linear in energy and its coefficient is
proportional to the square of temperature. Furthermore we find that the nematic

energy without clear dispersive features. A possible phase diagram for the spin

case we have a dual pair resulting from the action of diffeomorphisms on point
particles (essentially by moving the points). We then augment our dual pair by
considering the action of diffeomorphisms on Taylor series, also known as jets.
The augmented weak dual pairs induce a hierarchy of particle-like solutions and
conservation laws with particles carrying a copy of a jet group. We call these
augmented particles jetlets. The jet groups serve as finite-dimensional models
of the diffeomorphism group itself, and so the jetlet particles serve as a
finite-dimensional model of the self-similarity exhibited by ideal
incompressible fluids. The conservation law associated to jetlet solutions is
shown to be a shadow of Kelvin's circulation theorem. Finally, we study the
dynamics of infinite time particle mergers. We prove that two merging particles
at the zeroth level in the hierarchy yield dynamics which asymptotically
approach that of a single particle in the first level in the hierarchy. This
merging behavior is then verified numerically as well as the exchange of
angular momentum which must occur during a near collision of two particles. The
resulting particle-like solutions suggest a new class of meshless methods which
work in dimensions $n \geq 2$ and which exhibit a shadow of Kelvin's

the incoming bits (before the interaction) form an individual sequence, rather

replaced by the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity of the incoming sequence, a fact
that gives rise to an entropic meaning of the LZ complexity, not only in

not just apply to programs written specifically for Loo.py, but also those
imported from other languages such as Fortran. It eases the trade-off between
achieving high performance, portability, and programmability by allowing the

associated resonances, in growing bulges in the inner regions of disk galaxies
have long been studied in the low-redshift nearby Universe. There it has long
been probed observationally, in particular through peanut-shaped bulges. This
secular growth of bulges in modern disk galaxies is driven by weak,
non-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudo-bulges at slow rates
and with long star-formation timescales. Disk instabilities at high redshift
(z>1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (10^10 to a few 10^11 Msun of stars)
are very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. High-redshift
disks are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 10^8-10^9
Msun of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxy
morphologies. The clumps and other features associated to the violent
instability drive disk evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms,
on short timescales. The giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into the
bulge in a few 10^8 yr. The instability in the very turbulent media drives
intense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region. Thick disks and
supermassive black holes can grow concurrently as a result of the violent
instability. This chapter reviews the properties of high-redshift disk
instabilities, the evolution of giant clumps and other features associated to
the instability, and the resulting growth of bulges and associated sub-galactic
components.

dynamics during inflation very often take advantage of the ""semi-classical""
approach, where the metric fluctuations are simply omitted. On the other hand,
a complete computation ought to take into account that the matter field
perturbation and scalar metric perturbation together constitute a single
physical degree of freedom. The question then naturally arises, in which sense
the semi-classical approach is an approximation to the complete calculation,
and whether there are specific limits where this is also a good approximation.
We consider the quantum corrected dynamics of interacting scalar fields in an
expanding inflationary background. We demonstrate this by explicitly computing
the leading quantum radiative corrections to the evolution equation of the mean
field (""condensate"") and the Friedmann equations taking into account scalar
perturbations of both the matter field and the metric, and when omitting the
latter. We find that the two agree in the limit H << M_pl , but one is not a
limit of the other. We also find that in simple models of inflation, H/M_pl is
not small enough that the two approaches can be said to agree. By direct
comparison, we demonstrate how to interpret the ""semi-classical"" approach often
employed in more complex computations as a well-defined approximation, and
quantify its validity.

1645-1715, but the exact level of sunspot activity is uncertain as based, to a
large extent, on historical generic statements of the absence of spots on the
Sun. Here we aim, using a conservative approach, to assess the level and length
of solar cycle during the Maunder minimum, on the basis of direct historical
records by astronomers of that time. A database of the active and inactive days
(days with and without recorded sunspots on the solar disc respectively) is
constructed for three models of different levels of conservatism (loose ML,
optimum MO and strict MS models) regarding generic no-spot records. We have
used the active day fraction to estimate the group sunspot number during the
MM. A clear cyclic variability is found throughout the MM with peaks at around
1655--1657, 1675, 1684 and 1705, and possibly 1666, with the active day
fraction not exceeding 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 during the core MM, for the three
models. Estimated sunspot numbers are found very low in accordance with a grand
minimum of solar activity.
  We have found, for the core MM (1650-1700), that: (1) A large fraction of
no-spot records, corresponding to the solar meridian observations, may be
unreliable in the conventional database. (2) The active day fraction remained
low (below 0.3-0.4) throughout the MM, indicating the low level of sunspot
activity. (3) The solar cycle appears clearly during the core MM. (4) The
length of the solar cycle during the core MM appears $9\pm 1$ years, but there
is an uncertainty in that. (5) The magnitude of the sunspot cycle during MM is
assessed to be below 5-10 in sunspot numbers;
  A hypothesis of the high solar cycles during the MM is not confirmed.

jet nuclear modification factor of reconstructed jets, the extracted data can
be characterized without a reduced jet-medium coupling at LHC energies. We
conclude that while reconstructed jets are sensitive to both quarks and gluons

their information regarding the jet-medium coupling is limited due to the
superimposition with NLO and medium effects. Hence, a detailed description of
the underlying physics requires both the leading hadron and the reconstructed

determining the causes of instability and contagion in financial networks is
necessary to inform policy and avoid future financial collapse. In the American
Economic Review, Elliott, Golub and Jackson proposed a simple model for
capturing the dynamics of complex financial networks. In Elliott, Golub and
Jackson's model, each institution in the network can buy underlying assets or
percentage shares in other institutions (cross-holdings) and if any
institution's value drops below a critical threshold value, its value suffers
an additional failure cost.
  This work shows that even in simple model put forward by Elliott, Golub and
Jackson there are fundamental barriers to understanding the risks that are
inherent in a network. First, if institutions are not required to maintain a
minimum amount of self-holdings, an $\epsilon$ change in investments by a
single institution can have an arbitrarily magnified influence on the net worth
of the institutions in the system. This sensitivity result shows that if
institutions have small self-holdings, then estimating the market value of an
institution requires almost perfect information about every cross-holding in
the system. Second, we show that even if a regulator has complete information
about all cross-holdings in the system, it may be computationally intractable
to even estimate the number of failures that could be caused by an arbitrarily
small shock to the system. Together, these results show that any uncertainty in
the cross-holdings or values of the underlying assets can be amplified by the
network to arbitrarily large uncertainty in the valuations of institutions in

physical processes related to ocean surface waves, namely the surface stress
(modified by growth and dissipation of the oceanic wave field), the turbulent
kinetic energy flux from breaking waves, and the Stokes-Coriolis force.
Experiments are done with NEMO in ocean-only (forced) mode and coupled to the
ECMWF atmospheric and wave models. Ocean-only integrations are forced with
fields from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. All three effects are noticeable in the
extra-tropics, but the sea-state dependent turbulent kinetic energy flux yields
by far the largest difference. This is partly because the control run has too
vigorous deep mixing due to an empirical mixing term in NEMO. We investigate
the relation between this ad hoc mixing and Langmuir turbulence and find that
it is much more effective than the Langmuir parameterization used in NEMO. The
biases in sea surface temperature as well as subsurface temperature are
reduced, and the total ocean heat content exhibits a trend closer to that
observed in a recent ocean reanalysis (ORAS4) when wave effects are included.
Seasonal integrations of the coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model consisting of
NEMO, the wave model ECWAM and the atmospheric model of ECMWF similarly show
that the sea surface temperature biases are greatly reduced when the mixing is
controlled by the sea state and properly weighted by the thickness of the
uppermost level of the ocean model. These wave-related physical processes were
recently implemented in the operational coupled ensemble forecast system of
ECMWF.

convex optimization problems solved by a network of computing and communicating

coupled, the dual decomposition scheme involves local parallel subgradient
calculations and a global subgradient update performed by a master node. In
this paper, we propose a consensus-based dual decomposition to remove the need
for such a master node and still enable the computing nodes to generate an
approximate dual solution for the underlying convex optimization problem. In
addition, we provide a primal recovery mechanism to allow the nodes to have
access to approximate near-optimal primal solutions. Our scheme is based on a
constant stepsize choice and the dual and primal objective convergence are
achieved up to a bounded error floor dependent on the stepsize and on the
number of consensus steps among the nodes.

exploit this variation to extract the magnetic properties of the oxide cladding

spectral analyses and use a simplified model to study the kinematics of this
system. The basic picture is that PLCK G036.7+14.9 is undergoing a major merger
(mass ratio close to unity) between the two massive subclusters, with the
merger largely along the line-of-sight and probably at an early stage. G036N
hosts a small, moderate cool-core, while G036S has at most a very weak
cool-core in the central 40 kpc region. The difference in core cooling times is
unlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger disrupting a pre-existing cool-core
in G036S. G036N also hosts an unresolved radio source in the center, which may
be heating the gas if the radio source is extended. The Planck derived mass is
higher than the X-ray measured mass of either subcluster, but is lower than the
X-ray measured mass of the whole cluster, due to the fact that Planck does not
resolve PLCK G036.7+14.9 into subclusters and interprets it as a single
cluster. This mass discrepancy could induce significant bias to the mass
function if such previously unresolved systems are common in the Planck cluster
sample. High resolution X-ray observations are necessary to identify the
fraction of such systems and correct such a bias for the purpose of precision
cosmological studies.

joint use of encoding of normalized image projections and a Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) classifier. The encoding is novel and it consists in
identifying the zero-crossings and extracting the relevant parameters from the
resulting modes. The compressed normalized projections produce feature
descriptors that are inputs to a properly-trained MLP, for discriminating among
various categories of image regions. The proposed framework forms a fast and
reliable system for the eye centers localization, especially in the context of
face expression analysis in unconstrained environments. We successfully test
the proposed method on a wide variety of databases including BioID,
Cohn-Kanade, Extended Yale B and Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases.

(PCs) of the hippocampus are key elements of the brain network for the metric
representation of space. Currently, any of the existing theoretical models can
explain all aspects of GC-specific spatially selective patterns of activity. It
is also not clear how these patterns are formed during the network development.
On the other hand, it was previously shown that the network that can learn to
extract high principal components from the activity of the place cells could
provide the basis for GC-like activity patterns development. Supporting this
hypothesis is the finding that PC activity remains spatially stable after the
disruption of the GC firing patterns and that grid patterns almost disappear
when hippocampal cells are deactivated. Development of the early PCs before GCs
formation also supports the role of PCs as the spatial information providers to
GCs. Here we have developed a new theoretical model of grid fields formation
based on synaptic plasticity in synapses connecting PCs in hippocampus and
neurons in entorhinal cortex. Learning of hexagonally symmetric fields in the
model is due to complex action of several simple biologicaly motivated synaptic
plasticity rules. These rules include associative synaptic plasticity rules
similar to BCM rule and homeostatic plasticity rules which restrict synaptic
weigths. In contrast to previously described models, this network could learn
GC patterns after a very short experience of navigation in a novel environment.
In conclusion we suggest that learning on the basis of simple and biologically
plausible associative synaptic plasticity rules could contribute to the
formation of grid fields in early development and to maintainence of normal GCs
activity patterns in familiar environments.

fundamental ideas of this approach, I shall concentrate on the mathematical
aspect and more exactly on the determination of the equations defining the
orbit space and its strata. I shall deal only with compact coregular linear
groups. The method exposed has been worked out together with prof. G. Sartori
and it is based on the solution of a matrix differential equation. Such
equation is easily solved if an integrity basis of the group is known. If the
integrity basis is unknown one may determine anyway for which degrees of the
basic invariants there are solutions to the equation, and in all these cases
also find out the explicit form of the solutions. The solutions determine
completely the stratification of the orbit spaces. Such calculations have been
carried out for 2, 3 and 4-dimensonal orbit spaces. The method is of general
validity but the complexity of the calculations rises tremendously with the

They allow to determine easily most of the solutions for the
$(q+1)$-dimensional case once the solutions for the $q$-dimensional case are
known. The method exposed is interesting because it allows to determine the
orbit spaces without using any specific knowledge of group structure and
integrity basis and evidences a certain hidden and yet unknown link with group
theory and invariant theory.

length-dependent manner, whereas passive cross linkers increase it
independently of the length. In addition to maintaining structural integrity,
passive cross linkers can thus also have a dynamic role for size regulation.

platforms such as LiquidFeedback to organise themselves and their political

another user, giving rise to so-called super-voters, i.e. powerful users who
receive many delegations. It has been asserted in the past that the presence of
these super-voters undermines the democratic process, and therefore delegative
democracy should be avoided. In this paper, we look at the emergence of
super-voters in the largest delegative online democracy platform worldwide,
operated by Germany's Pirate Party. We investigate the distribution of power
within the party systematically, study whether super-voters exist, and explore
the influence they have on the outcome of votings conducted online. While we
find that the theoretical power of super-voters is indeed high, we also observe
that they use their power wisely. Super-voters do not fully act on their power
to change the outcome of votes, but they vote in favour of proposals with the
majority of voters in many cases thereby exhibiting a stabilising effect on the
system. We use these findings to present a novel class of power indices that
considers observed voting biases and gives significantly better predictions
than state-of-the-art measures.

well has been evaluated using self-avoiding as well as ideal chain
representations of varying length, up to 80 beads. Long timescale Langevin
trajectories were calculated using the path integral hyperdynamics method to
evaluate the escape rate. A minimum is found in the rate for self-avoiding
polymers of intermediate length while the escape rate decreases monotonically
with polymer length for ideal polymers. The increase in the rate for long,
self-avoiding polymers is ascribed to crowding in the potential well which
reduces the free energy escape barrier. An effective potential curve obtained
using the centroid as an independent variable was evaluated by thermodynamic
averaging and Kramers rate theory then applied to estimate the escape rate.
While the qualitative features are well reproduced by this approach, it
significantly overestimates the rate, especially for the longer polymers. The
reason for this is illustrated by constructing a two-dimensional effective
energy surface using the radius of gyration as well as the centroid as
controlled variables. This shows that the description of a transition state
dividing surface using only the centroid fails to confine the system to the
region corresponding to the free energy barrier and this problem becomes more
pronounced the longer the polymer is. A proper definition of a transition state

constructed in terms of the physical quantity of interest itself, for example
the density. Therefore, the calculation of important properties such as total
energies or photoemission spectra requires the solution of non-linear equations
that have unphysical and physical solutions. In this work we show in which
circumstances one runs into an unphysical solution, and we indicate how one can
overcome this problem. Moreover, we solve the puzzle of when and why the
interacting Green's function does not unambiguously determine the underlying
system, given in terms of its potential, or non-interacting Green's function.
Our results are general since they originate from the fundamental structure of
the equations. The absorption spectrum of lithium fluoride is shown as one
illustration, and observations in the literature for some widely used models
are explained by our approach. Our findings apply to both the weak and
strong-correlation regimes. For the strong-correlation regime we show that one
cannot use the expressions that are obtained from standard perturbation theory,
and we suggest a different approach that is exact in the limit of strong
interaction.

where SIA is applied is determined automatically and dynamically based on
estimates of the modeling error. For a three dimensional model problem where
the number of degrees of freedom is comparable to a real world application,
ISCAL performs almost an order of magnitude faster with a low reduction in
accuracy compared to a monolithic FS. Furthermore, ISCAL is shown to be able to
detect rapid dynamic changes in the flow. Three different error estimations are
applied and compared. Finally, ISCAL is applied to the Greenland Ice Sheet,
proving ISCAL to be a potential valuable tool for the ice sheet modeling

Wind-collision region (WCR) models can reproduce the radio continuum spectra of
massive binaries that contain both thermal and non-thermal radio emission;
however, key constraints for models come from high-resolution imaging. Only
five WCRs have been resolved to date at radio frequencies at milliarcsec (mas)
angular scales. The source HD 93129A, prototype of the very few known O2 I
stars, is a promising target for study: recently, a second massive, early-type
star about 50 mas away was discovered, and a non-thermal radio source detected
in the region. Preliminary long-baseline array data suggest that a significant
fraction of the radio emission from the system comes from a putative WCR. We
sought evidence that HD 93129A is a massive binary system with colliding
stellar winds that produce non-thermal radiation, through spatially resolved
images of the radio emitting regions. We completed observations with the
Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) to resolve the system at mas angular
resolutions and reduced archival Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) data

of the system in a homogeneous way. We reduced historical Hubble Space
Telescope data and obtained absolute and relative astrometry with milliarcsec
accuracy. The astrometric analysis leads us to conclude that the two stars in
HD 93129A form a gravitationally bound system. The LBA data reveal an extended
arc-shaped non-thermal source between the two stars, indicative of a WCR. The

fraction of BSs in these clusters was formed by the binary mass-transfer
mechanism. The aim of our present investigation is to obtain and analyze a set
of evolutionary models of cool, close detached binaries with a low metal
abundance, which are characteristic of GC. We computed the evolution of 975
models of initially detached, cool close binaries with different initial
parameters. The models include mass exchange between components as well as mass
and angular momentum loss due to the magnetized winds for very low-metallicity
binaries with Z = 0.001. The models are interpreted in the context of existing
data on contact binary and blue straggler members of GCs. The model parameters
agree well with the observed positions of the GC contact binaries in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Contact binaries in the lower part of the cluster
main sequence are absent because there are no binaries with initial orbital
periods shorter than 1.5 d. Contact binaries end their evolution as mergers
that appear in the BS region. Binary-formed BSs populate the whole observed BS
region in a GC, but a gap is visible between low-mass mergers that are
concentrated along the zero-age main sequence and binary BSs occupying the red
part of the BS region. Very few binary mergers are expected to rotate rapidly
and/or possess chemical peculiarities resulting from the exposure of the layers
processed by CNO nuclear reactions. All other binary mergers are
indistinguishable from the collisionally formed mergers. The results show that
binary-formed BSs may constitute at least a substantial fraction of all BSs in

and the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction which introduce mixing of $\pi$ and
$\sigma$ bonds between the $p_z$ orbitals along the CNT. The effect contributes
to the main origin of the SO coupling--the folding of the graphene plane into
the nanotube. We discuss the bend-related contribution of the SO coupling for
resonant single-electron spin and charge transitions in a double quantum dot.
We report that although the effect of the bend-related SO coupling is weak for
the energy spectra, it produces a pronounced increase of the spin transition
rates driven by an external electric field. We find that spin-flipping
transitions driven by alternate electric fields have usually larger rates when
accompanied by charge shift from one dot to the other. Spin-flipping transition
rates are non-monotonic functions of the driving amplitude since they are
masked by stronger spin-conserving charge transitions. We demonstrate that the
fractional resonances--counterparts of multiphoton transitions for atoms in

These surface states can only be removed by a bulk topological quantum phase
transition into a trivial phase. Here we use photoemission spectroscopy to
image the formation of protected surface states in a topological insulator as
we chemically tune the system through a topological transition. Surprisingly,
we discover an exotic spin-momentum locked, gapped surface state in the trivial
phase that shares many important properties with the actual topological surface
state in anticipation of the change of topology. Using a spin-resolved
measurement, we show that apart from a surface band-gap these states develop
spin textures similar to the topological surface states well-before the
transition. Our results offer a general paradigm for understanding how surface
states in topological phases arise and are suggestive for future realizing Weyl
arcs, condensed matter supersymmetry and other fascinating phenomena in the
vicinity of topological quantum criticality.

dimensional confining theory are considered. The perturbations are induced by
varying the coupling to the theory's most relevant operator. The dual
gravitational theory belongs to a class of Einstein-dilaton theories which
exhibit a mass gap at zero temperature and a first order deconfining phase
transition at finite temperature. The perturbation is realized in various
thermal bulk solutions by specifying time dependent boundary conditions on the
scalar, and we solve the fully backreacted Einstein-dilaton equations of motion
subject to these boundary conditions. We compute the characteristic time scale
of many thermalization processes, noting that in every case we examine, this
time scale is determined by the imaginary part of the lowest lying quasi-normal
mode of the final state black brane. We quantify the dependence of this final
state on parameters of the quench, and construct a dynamical phase diagram.
Further support for a universal scaling regime in the abrupt quench limit is
provided.

  Cryptocurrency","39 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NeuCoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency derived from Sunny
King's Peercoin, which itself was derived from Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin. As
with Peercoin, proof-of-stake replaces proof-of-work as NeuCoin's security
model, effectively replacing the operating costs of Bitcoin miners
(electricity, computers) with the capital costs of holding the currency.
Proof-of-stake also avoids proof-of-work's inherent tendency towards
centralization resulting from competition for coinbase rewards among miners
based on lowest cost electricity and hash power.
  NeuCoin increases security relative to Peercoin and other existing
proof-of-stake currencies in numerous ways, including: (1) incentivizing nodes
to continuously stake coins over time through substantially higher mining
rewards and lower minimum stake age; (2) abandoning the use of coin age in the
mining formula; (3) causing the stake modifier parameter to change over time
for each stake; and (4) utilizing a client that punishes nodes that attempt to
mine on multiple branches with duplicate stakes.
  This paper demonstrates how NeuCoin's proof-of-stake implementation addresses
all commonly raised ""nothing at stake"" objections to generic proof-of-stake
systems. It also reviews many of the flaws of proof-of-work designs to
highlight the potential for an alternate cryptocurrency that solves these
flaws.

orbital resonance can be misinterpreted as a single eccentric planet, if data
are sparse and measurement precision insufficient to distinguish between these
models. We determine the fraction of alleged single-planet RV detected systems
for which a 2:1 resonant pair of planets is also a viable model and address the
question of how the models can be disentangled. By simulation we quantified the
mismatch arising from applying the wrong model. Model alternatives are
illustrated using the supposed single-planet system HD 27894 for which we also
study the dynamical stability of near-2:1 resonant solutions. From the data
scatter around the fitted single-planet Keplerians, we find that for $74\% $ of
the $254$ putative single-planet systems, a 2:1 resonant pair cannot be
excluded as a viable model, since the error due to the wrong model is smaller
than the scatter. For $187$ stars $\chi ^2$-probabilities can be used to reject
the Keplerian models with a confidence of $95\% $ for $54\% $ of the stars and
with $99.9\% $ for $39\% $ of the stars. For HD 27894 a considerable fit
improvement is obtained when adding a low-mass planet near half the orbital
period of the known Jovian planet. Dynamical analysis demonstrates that this
system is stable when both planets are initially placed on circular orbits. For
fully Keplerian orbits a stable system is only obtained if the eccentricity of
the inner planet is constrained to $<0.3$. A large part of the allegedly RV
detected single-planet systems should be scrutinized in order to determine the
fraction of systems containing near-2:1 resonant pairs of planets. Knowing the
abundance of such systems will allow us to revise the eccentricity distribution
for extrasolar planets and provide direct constraints for planetary system
formation.

initial conditions? This addresses the question if the general inflationary
paradigm is sufficient to predict within a given model the spectrum and
amplitude of cosmic fluctuations, or if additional particular assumptions about
the initial conditions are needed. The answer depends on the number of
e-foldings $N_{in}$ between the beginning of inflation and horizon crossing of
the observable fluctuations. We discuss an interacting inflaton field in an
arbitrary homogeneous and isotropic geometry, employing the quantum effective
action $\Gamma$. An exact time evolution equation for the correlation function
involves the second functional derivative $\Gamma^{(2)}$. The operator
formalism and quantum vacua for interacting fields are not needed. Use of the
effective action also allows one to address the change of frames by field
transformations (field relativity). Within the approximation of a derivative
expansion for the effective action we find the most general solution for the
correlation function, including mixed quantum states. For not too large
$N_{in}$ the memory of the initial conditions is preserved. In this case the
cosmic microwave background cannot disentangle between the initial spectrum and
its processing at horizon crossing. The inflaton potential cannot be
reconstructed without assumptions about the initial state of the universe. We
argue that for very large $N_{in}$ a universal scaling form of the correlation
function is reached for the range of observable modes. This can be due to
symmetrization and equilibration effects, not yet contained in our
approximation, which drive the short distance tail of the correlation function
towards the Lorentz invariant propagator in flat space.

inhomogeneous and accelerated manner. For understanding this phenomenon, some
aging changes are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in
Misrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of repair for
survival of an organism in situations of severe injuries; however a Misrepair
alters the structure of a tissue, a cell or a molecule, which are the
sub-structures of an organism. II. Misrepair of a sub-structure also alters the
spatial relationship of this sub-structure with its neighbor sub-structures.
Thus a Misrepair leads to increased damage-sensitivity and reduced
repair-efficiency of these sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a
tendency to occur to the sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an
old Misrepair has taken place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again
the damage-sensitivity of these sub-structures and the surrounding
sub-structures. By such a vicious circle, the frequency of Misrepairs to these
sub-structures is increased and the range of affected sub-structures is
enlarged after each time of Misrepair. Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is
focalized and self-accelerating. III. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs
leads to formation and growing of a ""spot"" or ""plaque"" in a tissue. Growing of
a spot is self-accelerating, and old spots grow faster than new ones. New spots
tend to develop close to old ones, resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution
of spots. In conclusion, the inhomogeneous development of aging changes is a
result of self-accelerated and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; and the
process of aging is self-accelerating.

bioengineering, yet are not fully understood. In biosensors, a key factor
determining the sensitivity and thus the performance of the device is the
orientation of the ligand molecules on the bioactive device surface. Adsorption
studies thus seek to determine how orientation can be influenced by surface
preparation. In this work, protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces is
obtained under electrostatic effects using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in
an implicit-solvent model. Sampling the free energy for protein GB1D4' at a
range of tilt and rotation angles with respect to the charged surface, we
calculated the probability of the protein orientations and observed a dipolar
behavior. This result is consistent with published experimental studies and
combined Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations using this small
protein, validating our method. More relevant to biosensor technology,
antibodies such as immunoglobulin G are still a formidable challenge to
molecular simulation, due to their large size. We obtained the probability
distribution of orientations for the iso-type IgG2a at varying surface charge
and salt concentration. This iso-type was not found to have a preferred
orientation in previous studies, unlike the iso-type IgG1 whose larger dipole
moment was assumed to make it easier to control. We find that the preferred
orientation of IgG2a can be favorable for biosensing with positive surface
charge of 0.05C/m$^{2}$ or higher and 37mM salt concentration. The results also
show that local interactions dominate over dipole moment for this protein.
Improving immunoassay sensitivity may thus be assisted by numerical studies
using our method (and open-source code), guiding changes to fabrication
protocols or protein engineering of ligand molecules to obtain more favorable
orientations.

the intensity of nonlinearity in the fiber. In order to verify whether the

such as RAID controllers, enclosures, expanders, interconnects and disks is
important from a storage system designer's point of view. A model that can
express all the failure characteristics of the whole RAID storage system can be
used to evaluate design choices, perform cost reliability trade-offs and
conduct sensitivity analyses. However, including such details makes the
computational models of reliability quickly infeasible.
  We present a CTMC reliability model for RAID storage systems that scales to
much larger systems than heretofore reported and we try to model all the
components as accurately as possible. We use several state-space reduction
techniques at the user level, such as aggregating all in-series components and
hierarchical decomposition, to reduce the size of our model. To automate
computation of reliability, we use the PRISM model checker as a CTMC solver
where appropriate. Our modelling techniques using PRISM are more practical (in
both time and effort) compared to previously reported Monte-Carlo simulation
techniques.
  Our model for RAID storage systems (that includes, for example, disks,
expanders, enclosures) uses Weibull distributions for disks and, where
appropriate, correlated failure modes for disks, while we use exponential
distributions with independent failure modes for all other components. To use
the CTMC solver, we approximate the Weibull distribution for a disk using sum
of exponentials and we confirm that this model gives results that are in
reasonably good agreement with those from the sequential Monte Carlo simulation
methods for RAID disk subsystems reported in literature earlier. Using a
combination of scalable techniques, we are able to model and compute
reliability for fairly large configurations with upto 600 disks using this
model.
