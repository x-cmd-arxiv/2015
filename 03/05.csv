The phase diagram of SBT as a function of the temperature includes an
intermediate phase between the high-temperature phase and the ferroelectric
ground state, while in the Niobium compound the intermediate phase is
suppressed and a single transition between the high- and low temperature
structures is observed. We present \emph{ab initio} calculations that reveal
the relevance of a trilinear coupling between three symmetry-adapted modes to
stabilize the ground sate in both compounds, being this coupling much stronger
in SBN. Within the framework of the phenomenological Landau theory, it is shown
that by solely increasing the strength of the trilinear coupling the topology
of the phase diagram of SBT can change up to suppress the intermediate phase.
Monte Carlo simulations on an idealized $\phi^4$ Hamiltonian confirm that the
trilinear coupling is the key parameter that determines the sequence of phase
transitions and that for higher dimensionality of the order parameters the
stability region of the intermediate phase is narrower.

equivalently, algorithms that approximate the distance from a given image to
the desired property (that is, the smallest fraction of pixels that need to
change in the image to ensure that the image satisfies the desired property).
Image processing is a particularly compelling area of applications for
sublinear-time algorithms and, specifically, property testing. However, for
testing algorithms to reach their full potential in image processing, they have
to be tolerant, which allows them to be resilient to noise. Prior to this work,
only one tolerant testing algorithm for an image property (image partitioning)
has been published.
  We design efficient approximation algorithms for the following fundamental
questions: What fraction of pixels have to be changed in an image so that it
becomes a half-plane? a representation of a convex object? a representation of
a connected object? More precisely, our algorithms approximate the distance to
three basic properties (being a half-plane, convexity, and connectedness)
within a small additive error $\epsilon$, after reading a number of pixels
polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ and independent of the size of the image. The
running time of the testers for half-plane and convexity is also polynomial in
$1/\epsilon$. Tolerant testers for these three properties were not investigated
previously. For convexity and connectedness, even the existence of distance
approximation algorithms with query complexity independent of the input size is
not implied by previous work. (It does not follow from the VC-dimension bounds,
since VC dimension of convexity and connectedness, even in two dimensions,
depends on the input size. It also does not follow from the existence of
non-tolerant testers.)

tame abstract elementary classes (AECs) with amalgamation. We show that
whenever such classes are categorical in a high-enough cardinal, they admit a

  $\mathbf{Theorem}$ (Superstability from categoricity)
  Let $K$ be a $(<\kappa)$-tame AEC with amalgamation. If $\kappa =
\beth_\kappa > \text{LS} (K)$ and $K$ is categorical in a $\lambda > \kappa$,
then:
  * $K$ is stable in all cardinals $\ge \kappa$.
  * $K$ is categorical in $\kappa$.
  * There is a type-full good $\lambda$-frame with underlying class
$K_\lambda$.
  Under more locality conditions, we prove that the frame extends to a global
independence notion (for types of arbitrary length).
  $\mathbf{Theorem}$ (A global independence notion from categoricity)
  Let $K$ be a densely type-local, fully tame and type short AEC with
amalgamation. If $K$ is categorical in unboundedly many cardinals, then there
exists $\lambda \ge \text{LS} (K)$ such that $K_{\ge \lambda}$ admits a global
independence relation with the properties of forking in a superstable
first-order theory.
  As an application, we deduce (modulo an unproven claim of Shelah) that
Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture for AECs (without assuming
categoricity in a successor cardinal) follows from the weak generalized
continuum hypothesis and a large cardinal axiom.
  $\textbf{Corollary}$
  Assume $2^{\lambda} < 2^{\lambda^+}$ for all cardinals $\lambda$, as well as
an unpublished claim of Shelah. If there exists a proper class of strongly
compact cardinals, then any AEC categorical in some high-enough cardinal is
categorical in all high-enough cardinals.

believe we know are based on a few intuitions about time, which are, in turn,
based on our conscious waking experiences. As far as I can tell, these
intuitions about time are something like this: 1) There is a physical world in
which events occur, 2) These events are mirrored by our perceptual re-creation
of them in essentially the same order in which they occur in the physical
world, 3) This re-creation of events occurs in a linear order based on our
conscious memory of them (e.g., event A is said to occur before event B if at
some point we do remember event A but we don not yet remember event B, and at
another point we remember both events), 4) Assuming we have good memories, what
we remember has occurred in the past and what we don not remember but we can
imagine might: a) never occur, b) occur when we are not conscious, or c) occur
in the future. These intuitions are excellent ones for understanding our
conscious conception of ordered events. However, they do not tell us anything
about how the non-conscious processes in our brains navigate events in time.
Currently, neuroscientists assume that neural processes of which we are
unaware, that is, non-conscious processes, create conscious awareness as a
reflection of physical reality (Singer, 2015). Thus, if we wish to understand
how events unfold in time in the physical world, we would do well to attempt to
get some hints about how these events are navigated by non-conscious processes.

effective Hamiltonian for a relevant subspace of states, incorporating effects
of its coupling to states with much higher unperturbed energy. It shares with
techniques from other fields the emphasis on the existence of widely separated
scales. Given this fact, the question arises whether it is feasible to improve
on the adiabatic approximation, similarly to some of those other approaches. A
number of authors have addressed the issue from the quantum optics/atomic
physics perspective, and have run into the issue of non-hermiticity of the
effective Hamiltonian improved beyond the adiabatic approximation, which poses
conceptual and practical problems. Here, we first briefly survey methods
present in the physics literature. Next, we rewrite the problems addressed by
the adiabatic elimination technique to make apparent the fact that they are
singular perturbation problems from the point of view of dynamical systems. We
apply the invariant manifold method for singular perturbation problems to this
case, and show that this method produces the equation named after Bloch in
nuclear physics. Given the wide separation of scales, it becomes intuitive that
the Bloch equation admits iterative/perturbative solutions. We show, using a
fixed point theorem, that indeed the iteration converges to a perturbative
solution that produces in turn an exact Hamiltonian for the relevant subspace.
We propose thus several sequences of effective Hamiltonians, starting with the
adiabatic elimination and improving on it. We show the origin of the
non-hermiticity, and that it is inessential given the isospectrality of the
effective non-hermitian operator and a corresponding effective hermitian
operator, which we build. We propose an application of the introduced
techniques to periodic Hamiltonians.

equal to 0 at $\zeta=0$, which ultimately leads to a degenerate limit

complementary approximation methods for modelling the dynamics of compact
binary systems. Comparison of their results in an overlapping domain of
validity provides a crucial test for both methods, and can be used to enhance
their accuracy, e.g. via the determination of previously unknown PN parameters.
Here, for the first time, we extend such comparisons to noncircular
orbits---specifically, to a system of two nonspinning objects in a bound
(eccentric) orbit. To enable the comparison we use a certain orbital-averaged
quantity $\langle U \rangle$ that generalizes Detweiler's redshift invariant.
The functional relationship $\langle U \rangle(\Omega_r,\Omega_\phi)$, where
$\Omega_r$ and $\Omega_\phi$ are the frequencies of the radial and azimuthal
motions, is an invariant characteristic of the conservative dynamics. We
compute $\langle U \rangle(\Omega_r,\Omega_\phi)$ numerically through linear
order in the mass ratio $q$, using a GSF code which is based on a
frequency-domain treatment of the linearized Einstein equations in the Lorenz
gauge. We also derive $\langle U \rangle(\Omega_r,\Omega_\phi)$ analytically
through 3PN order, for an arbitrary $q$, using the known near-zone 3PN metric
and the generalized quasi-Keplerian representation of the motion. We
demonstrate that the $\mathcal{O}(q)$ piece of the analytical PN prediction is
perfectly consistent with the numerical GSF results, and we use the latter to
estimate yet unknown pieces of the 4PN expression at $\mathcal{O}(q)$.

paper is to study the relevance of additional components which should naturally
occur in a SSC scenario for a better understanding of the emission mechanisms,
especially at very high energies (VHE). Methods. We use simultaneous data from
a multi-wavelength campaign of Planck, Swift-UVOT and Swift-XRT telescopes
carried out in February 2010, as well as quasi-simultaneous data of WISE, Fermi
and H.E.S.S. taken in 2010. The multi-lambda emission of Ap Lib is modelled by
a blob-in-jet SSC scenario including the contribution of the base of the VLBI
extended jet, the radiative blob-jet interaction, the accretion disk and its
associated external photon field. We show that signatures of a strong
parsec-scale jet and of an accretion disk emission are present in the SED. We
can link the observationnal VLBI jet features from MOJAVE to parameters
expected for a VHE emitting blob accelerated near the jet base. The VHE
emission appears to be dominated by the inverse-Compton effect of the blob
relativistic electrons interacting with the jet synchrotron radiation. In such
scenario Ap Lib appears as an intermediate source between BL Lac objects and
Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars. Ap Lib could be a bright representative of a
specific class of blazars, in which the parsec-scale jet luminosity is no more
negligible compared to the blob and contributes to the high energy emission via
inverse Compton processes.

fluorine-carbon bonding. Our simple tight-binding model, that includes the SOC
of the $2p$ orbitals of F and effective parameters based on maximally localized
Wannier functions, is able to account for the effect. The strong enhancement of
the SOC induced by graphene doping opens the possibility to tune the spin
relaxation in this material.

social context as independence, on a duplex network. To study the role of the
multi-levelness we propose three methods of transferring the model from a mono-
to a multiplex network. They take into account two criteria -- one related to
the status of independence (LOCAL vs. GLOBAL) and one related to peer pressure
(AND vs. OR). In order to examine the influence of the presence of more than
one level in the social network, we perform simulations on a particularly
simple multiplex -- a duplex clique, which consists of two fully overlapped
complete graphs (cliques). Solving numerically the rate equation and
simultaneously conducting Monte Carlo simulations, we provide evidence that
even a simple rearrangement into a duplex topology may lead to significant
changes in the observed behavior. However, qualitative changes in the phase
transitions can be observed for only one of the considered rules -- LOCAL&AND.
For this rule the phase transition becomes discontinuous for q=5, whereas for a
monoplex such a behavior is observed for q=6. Interestingly, only this rule
admits construction of realistic variants of the model, in line with recent
social experiments.

simulations of mathematical models that can be applied to a broad class of
stochastic, discrete, and differential equation models. Quantifying uncertainty
is crucial for determining how accurate the model predictions are and
identifying which input parameters affect the outputs of interest. Most of the
existing methods for uncertainty quantification require many samples to
generate accurate results, are unable to differentiate where the uncertainty is
coming from (e.g., parameters or model assumptions), or require a lot of
computational resources. Our approach addresses these challenges and
opportunities by allowing different types of uncertainty, that is, uncertainty
in input parameters as well as uncertainty created through stochastic model
components. This is done by combining the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition,
polynomial chaos expansion, and Bayesian Gaussian process regression to create
a statistical surrogate for the stochastic model. The surrogate separates the
analysis of variation arising through stochastic simulation and variation
arising through uncertainty in the model parameterization. We illustrate our
approach by quantifying the uncertainty in a stochastic ordinary differential
equation epidemic model. Specifically, we estimate four quantities of interest
for the epidemic model and show agreement between the surrogate and the actual
model results.

PONDER makes use of the current state of the art computing hardware, a
Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and sufficiently large disk storage to support
high time resolution real-time data of pulsar observations, obtained by
coherent dedispersion over a bandpass of 16 MHz. Four different modes for
pulsar observations are implemented in PONDER to provide standard reduced data
products, such as time-stamped integrated profiles and dedispersed time series,
allowing faster avenues to scientific results for a variety of pulsar studies.
Additionally, PONDER also supports general modes of interplanetary
scintillation (IPS) measurements and very long baseline interferometry data
recording. The IPS mode yields a single polarisation correlated time series of
solar wind scintillation over a bandwidth of about four times larger (16 MHz)
than that of the legacy system as well as its fluctuation spectrum with high
temporal and frequency resolutions. The key point is that all the above modes
operate in real time. This paper presents the design aspects of PONDER and
outlines the design methodology for future similar backends. It also explains
the principal operations of PONDER, illustrates its capabilities for a variety
of pulsar and IPS observations and demonstrates its usefulness for a variety of
astrophysical studies using the high sensitivity of the ORT.

introduces nearly isotropic stress that gives the fluid core of the star an

the tangled field eliminates the problematic Alfv\'en continuum that would
exist in the stellar core for an organized field. For a tangled field energy
density comparable to that inferred from the measured dipole fields of $\sim
10^{15}$ G in SGRs 1806-20 and 1900+14, torsional modes exist with fundamental
frequencies of about 20 Hz, and mode spacings of $\sim 10$ Hz. For fixed
stellar mass and radius, the model has only one free parameter, and can account
for {\em every} observed QPO under 160 Hz to within 3 Hz for both SGRs 1806-20
and 1900+14. The combined effects of stratification and crust stresses
generally decrease the frequencies of torsional oscillations by $<10$% for
overtones and increase the lowest-frequency fundamentals by up to 50%, and so
the star can be treated as having constant density to a generally good first
approximation. We address the issue of mode excitation by sudden readjustment
of the stellar magnetosphere. While the total energy in excited modes is well
within the energy budget of giant flares, the surface amplitude is $< 10^{-3}$
of the stellar radius for global oscillations, and decreases strongly with mode
frequency. The 626 Hz QPO reported for SGR 1806-20 is particularly problematic
to excite beyond a surface amplitude of $10^{-6}$ of the stellar radius.

Theorem occurs in Chapter 5 of his PhD thesis [1930] --- entitled Recherches

is, together with G\""odel's incompleteness theorems and Gentzen's Hauptsatz,
one of the most influential theorems of modern logic. Because of its
complexity, Herbrand's Fundamental Theorem is typically fouled up in textbooks

Union2.1 and the JLA datasets. Firstly, we show that the angular distributions
for both SNe Ia datasets are statistically anisotropic at high confidence level
($p$-value $<$ 0.0001), in particular the JLA sample. Then we find that the
cosmic expansion and acceleration are mainly of dipolar type, with maximal
anisotropic expansion [acceleration] pointing towards $(l,b) \simeq
(326^{\circ},12^{\circ})$ [$(l,b) \simeq (174^{\circ},27^{\circ})$], and $(l,b)
\simeq (58^{\circ},-60^{\circ})$ [$(l,b) \simeq (225^{\circ},51^{\circ})$] for
the Union2.1 and JLA data, respectively. Secondly, we use a geometrical method
to test the hypothesis that the non-uniformly distributed SNe Ia events could
introduce anisotropic imprints on the cosmological expansion and acceleration.
For the JLA compilation, we found significant correlations between the
celestial distribution of data points and the directional studies of $H_0$ and
$q_0$, suggesting that these results can be attributed to the intrinsic
anisotropy of the sample. In the case of the Union2.1 data, nonetheless, these
correlations are less pronounced, and we verify that the dipole asymmetry found
in the $H_0$ analyses coincides with the well-known bulk-flow motion of our
local group. From these analyses, we conclude that the directional asymmetry on
the cosmological parameters maps are mainly either of local origin or due to
celestial incompleteness of current SNe Ia samples.

biochemical reactions. This method can be applied to networks with polynomial
or rational reaction rates and whose parameters are given by their orders of
magnitude. In order to obtain reduced models we solve the problem of tropical
equilibration that is a system of equations in max-plus algebra. In the case of
networks with nonlinear fast cycles we have to solve the problem of tropical
equilibration at least twice, once for the initial system and a second time for
an extended system obtained by adding to the initial system the differential
equations satisfied by the conservation laws of the fast subsystem. The two
steps can be reiterated until the fast subsystem has no conservation laws
different from the ones of the full model. Our method can be used for formal
model reduction in computational systems biology.

(CSS) with multiple antenna nodes over composite and generalized fading
channels. We model the probability density function (PDF) of the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using the mixture gamma (MG) distribution. We then
derive a generalized closed-form expression for the probability of energy
detection, which can be used efficiently for generalized multipath as well as
composite (multipath and shadowing) fading channels. The composite effect of
fading and shadowing scenarios in CSS is mitigated by applying an optimal
fusion rule that minimizes the total error rate (TER), where the optimal number
of nodes is derived under the Bayesian criterion, assuming erroneous feedback
channels. For imperfect feedback channels, we demonstrate the existence of a
TER floor as the number of antennas of the CR nodes increases. Accordingly, we
derive the optimal rule for the number of antennas that minimizes the TER.
Numerical and Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to corroborate the
analytical results and to provide illustrative performance comparisons between
different composite fading channels.

spanning from information theory and artificial intelligence to game theory and

although all of them make use of money to make the challenge meaningful and,
moreover, can be played in two different formats: tournament and cash game. An
important issue when dealing with Poker is its classification, i.e., as a
`skill game' or as gambling. Nowadays, its classification still represents an
open question, having a long list of implications (e.g., legal and healthcare)
that vary from country to country. In this study, we analyze Poker challenges,
considering the cash game format, in terms of thermodynamics systems. Notably,
we propose a framework to represent a cash game Poker challenge that, although
based on a simplified scenario, allows both to obtain useful information for
rounders (i.e., Poker players), and to evaluate the role of Poker room in this

evolution of a Poker challenge, making a direct connection with the probability
theory underlying its dynamics and finding that, even if we consider these
games as `skill games', to take a real profit from Poker is really hard.

nine Fermi pockets, including one hole pocket at the Brillouin zone center
$\Gamma$, and two hole pockets and two electron pockets on each side of
$\Gamma$ along the $\Gamma$-$X$ direction. Remarkably, we have observed
circular dichroism in our photoemission spectra, which suggests that the
orbital angular momentum exhibits a rich texture at various sections of the
Fermi surface. As reported previously for topological insulators and Rashiba
systems, such a circular dichroism is a signature for spin-orbital coupling
(SOC). This is further confirmed by our density functional theory calculations,
where the spin texture is qualitatively reproduced as the conjugate consequence
of SOC. Since the backscattering processes are directly involved with the
resistivity, our data suggest that the SOC and the related spin and orbital
angular momentum textures may be considered in the understanding of the
anomalous magnetoresistance of WTe$_2$.

  To illustrate this, we study matrix models with a cubic action, and show how
breaking its natural triality symmetry by imposing different compactifications
yields particle mechanics, string theory and Chern-Simons theory. These result
from compactifying, respectively, one, two and three dimensions. This may
explain the origin of Born's duality between position and momenta operators in

A
common example is hierarchical label spaces, corresponding to the case where
one label subsumes another (e.g., animal subsumes dog). But labels can also be
mutually exclusive (e.g., dog vs cat) or unrelated (e.g., furry, carnivore). To
jointly model hierarchy and exclusion relations, the notion of a HEX (hierarchy
and exclusion) graph was introduced in [7]. This combined a conditional random
field (CRF) with a deep neural network (DNN), resulting in state of the art
results when applied to visual object classification problems where the
training labels were drawn from different levels of the ImageNet hierarchy
(e.g., an image might be labeled with the basic level category ""dog"", rather
than the more specific label ""husky""). In this paper, we extend the HEX model
to allow for soft or probabilistic relations between labels, which is useful
when there is uncertainty about the relationship between two labels (e.g., an
antelope is ""sort of"" furry, but not to the same degree as a grizzly bear). We
call our new model pHEX, for probabilistic HEX. We show that the pHEX graph can
be converted to an Ising model, which allows us to use existing off-the-shelf
inference methods (in contrast to the HEX method, which needed specialized
inference algorithms). Experimental results show significant improvements in a
number of large-scale visual object classification tasks, outperforming the

is described as a Hamiltonian evolution problem. It is shown that the
computational complexity has a power-law dependence on error when a
straightforward Lie-Trotter discretisation formula is used, and it becomes
logarithmic in error when reflection operators are used. The exponential change
in error control is striking, and can be used to improve many importance
sampling methods. The key concept is to make the evolution steps as large as

extraordinary channels for spreading and consuming information. Along with the
rise of such infrastructure, there is continuous progress on techniques for
spreading information effectively through influential users. In many
applications, one is restricted to select influencers from a set of users who
engaged with the topic being promoted, and due to the structure of social
networks, these users often rank low in terms of their influence potential. An
alternative approach one can consider is an adaptive method which selects users
in a manner which targets their influential neighbors. The advantage of such an
approach is that it leverages the friendship paradox in social networks: while
users are often not influential, they often know someone who is.
  Despite the various complexities in such optimization problems, we show that
scalable adaptive seeding is achievable. In particular, we develop algorithms
for linear influence models with provable approximation guarantees that can be
gracefully parallelized. To show the effectiveness of our methods we collected
data from various verticals social network users follow. For each vertical, we
collected data on the users who responded to a certain post as well as their
neighbors, and applied our methods on this data. Our experiments show that
adaptive seeding is scalable, and importantly, that it obtains dramatic

derivation also shows how to correct eddy viscosity models. The report proves
the corrected models preserve important features of the true Reynolds stresses.
It gives algorithms for their discretization including a minimally invasive

numerical test is given with the usual and over diffusive Smagorinsky model.

Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks (IVWSNs) have recently received a lot
of attention in the automotive industry as they can reduce the amount of wiring
harness inside a vehicle. By removing the wires, car manufacturers can reduce
the weight of a vehicle and improve engine performance, fuel economy, and
reliability. In addition to these direct benefits, an IVWSN is a versatile
platform that can support other vehicular applications as well. An example
application, known as a Side Blind Zone Alert (SBZA) system, which monitors the
blind zone of the vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent
collisions, is discussed in this paper. The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA
system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles. Our
results show that the proposed system can achieve approximately 95% to 99%
detection rate with less than 15% false alarm rate. Compared to commercial
systems using radars or cameras, the main benefit of the IVWSN-based SBZA is
substantially lower cost.

contrast in dust optical depth between the parent belt and the interior regions
that results from the dominance of collisions over drag in systems with
detectable cool belts. Here, we show that the levels of habitable zone dust
arising from detectable Kuiper belt analogues can be tens to a few hundreds of
times greater than the optical depth in the Solar Zodiacal cloud. Dust
enhancements of more than a few tens of `zodi' are expected to hinder future
Earth-imaging missions, but relatively few undetectable Kuiper belts result in
such levels, particularly around stars older than a few Gyr. Thus, current mid
to far-IR photometric surveys have already identified most of the 20-25% of
nearby stars where P-R drag from outer belts could seriously impact
Earth-imaging. The LBTI should easily detect such warm dust around many nearby
stars with outer belts, and will provide insight into currently unclear details
of the competition between P-R drag and collisions. Given sufficient confidence
in future models, the inevitability of P-R drag means that the non-detection of
warm dust where detectable levels were expected could be used to infer
additional dust removal process, the most likely being the presence of
intervening planets.

Using this matrix integral, we compute the two- and three-link averages with an

four-zero texture in the Yukawa matrices and a general Higgs potential. We
consider theoretically consistent scenarios in agreement with current
experimental data from flavor and Higgs physics. We investigate the charged
current production process $\nu_e \phi q$ in presence of flavor violating
decays of the Higgs bosons, that lead to a 3-jets + $E\!\!\!\!/_T$ signature.
We demand exactly two jets, one tagged $b$-jet and one light-flavor jet, all in
the central rapidity region. The remaining jet (originated by the remanent
quark $q$) is tagged in the forward or backward regions and this together with
a central jet veto (not more than one light-flavor jet) are essential
criterions to enhance the signal--to--background rates. We consider the most
relevant Standard Model (SM) backgrounds, treating $c$-jets separately from
light-flavor and gluon ones, while allowing for mis-tagging. We find that the
SM-like Higgs boson, $h$, would be accessible within several parameter
configurations of our model at approximately the 1-2$\sigma$ level with 100
fb$^{-1}$ of data. We also find that the heaviest neutral Higgs boson, $H$,
with mass up to 150 GeV, would have a 1$\sigma$ significance for the same data
sample. At the end of the LHeC running, one would have ten times data
accumulation and for all the Higgs masses the significances are enhanced so as
to allow for detection of both the $h$ and $H$ state. Hence, one of the most
viable extensions of 2HDMs with FCNC's generated at tree level but controlled
by a four-zero texture approach in the Yukawa matrices, as opposed to the
adoption of ad hoc discrete symmetries, could be put under scrutiny at a future
LHeC.

source by self-emitted Alfven waves. The second is the problem of diffusive
propagation of CRs through the turbulent ISM. This is a seemingly

simulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first
principles and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than
aligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique
pulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to
the standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away
from the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is
the primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To
demonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and
orthogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description
of the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped
magnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties
outside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet
separates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each
other. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,
rather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across
the current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a
mechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical
description of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar
gamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse
gamma-ray bursts and supernovae.

simulations of merging pairs of gas-rich spiral galaxies. Our goal is to
provide an estimate of the combined effect of merging and RPS on stripping
efficiency and star formation rate.
  Methods: We make use of the combined N-body/hydrodynamic code GADGET-2. In
our simulations, we vary mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:8 in a binary merger. We
sample different geometric configurations of the merging systems (edge-on and
face-on mergers, different impact parameters). Furthermore, we vary the
properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in rough steps: The speed of the
merging system relative to the ICM between 500 and 1000 km/s, the ICM density
between $10^{-29}$ and $10^{-27}$ g/cm$^3$, and the ICM direction relative to
the mergers' orbital plane. Ram pressure is kept constant within a simulation
time period, as is the ICM temperature of $10^7$ K. Each simulation in the ICM
is compared to simulations of the merger in vacuum and the non-merging galaxies
with acting ram pressure.
  Results: Averaged over the simulation time (1 Gyr) the merging pairs show a
negligible 5% enhancement in SFR, when compared to single galaxies under the
same environmental conditions. The SFRs peak at the time of the galaxies first
fly-through. There, our simulations show SFRs of up to 20 M$_{\odot}$/yr
(compared to 3 M$_{\odot}$/yr of the non-merging galaxies in vacuum). In the
most extreme case, this constitutes a short-term ($<50$ Myr) SFR increase of
50% over the non-merging galaxies experiencing ram pressure. The wake of
merging galaxies in the ICM typically has a third to half the star mass seen in
the non-merging galaxies and 5% to 10 % less gas mass. The joint effect of RPS
and merging, according to our simulations, is not significantly different from
pure ram pressure effects.

noises and interruptions caused by outliers, saturation events or transmission
losses. We assess the impact of missing data on the performance of linear
regression analysis involving the fit of modeled or measured time series. We
show that data gaps can significantly alter the precision of the regression
parameter estimation in the presence of colored noise, due to the frequency
leakage of the noise power. We present a regression method which cancels this
effect and estimates the parameters of interest with a precision comparable to
the complete data case, even if the noise power spectral density (PSD) is not
known a priori. The method is based on an autoregressive (AR) fit of the noise,
which allows us to build an approximate generalized least squares estimator
approaching the minimal variance bound. The method, which can be applied to any
similar data processing, is tested on simulated measurements of the MICROSCOPE
space mission, whose goal is to test the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) with
a precision of $10^{-15}$. In this particular context the signal of interest is
the WEP violation signal expected to be found around a well defined frequency.
We test our method with different gap patterns and noise of known PSD and find
that the results agree with the mission requirements, decreasing the
uncertainty by a factor 60 with respect to ordinary least squares methods. We
show that it also provides a test of significance to assess the uncertainty of
the measurement.

quasi-equilibrium thermodynamics. The tight coupling between the macroscale and
the mesoscale distinguishes our results from previously published studies. The
inclusion of Marangoni driven fluid flow and heat transfer, both during heating
and cooling, was found to be crucial for accurately predicting both weld pool
shape and grain morphology. However, if only the shape of the weld pool is of
interest, a thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium solidification model, neglecting
solidification kinetics, was found to suffice when including fluid flow and
heat transfer. We demonstrate that the addition of a sufficient concentration
of approximately 1 $\mu$m diameter TiN grain refining particles effectively
triggers a favorable transition from columnar dendritic to equiaxed grains, as
it allows for the latter to heterogeneously nucleate in the undercooled melt
ahead of the columnar dendritic front. This transition from columnar to
equiaxed growth is achievable for widely differing weld conditions, and its
precise nature is relatively insensitive to the concentration of particles and

perpendicular ferromagnet via the spin Hall effect is studied. Both the
dampinglike and fieldlike torques associated with the spin current generated by
the spin Hall effect is included in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to
model the system. In the absence of the fieldlike torque, the critical current
is independent of the damping constant and is much larger than that of
conventional spin torque switching of collinear magnetic systems, as in
magnetic tunnel junctions. With the fieldlike torque included, we find that the
critical current scales with the damping constant as $\alpha^{0}$ (i.e.,
damping independent),$\alpha$, and $\alpha^{1/2}$ depending on the sign of the
fieldlike torque and other parameters such as the external field. Numerical and
analytical results show that the critical current can be significantly reduced

effective field associated with the fieldlike torque is pointing opposite to
the spin direction of the incoming electrons. These results provide a pathway

half of the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field in the $3 +

degrees of freedom, they cannot ordinarily be given solely by two scalar
potentials. Such expressions have been derived however, in coordinate form, for
all TT tensors in flat space which are also translationally or axially
symmetric (Conboye and \'O Murchadha 2014 \emph{Class. Quantum Grav.} {\bf 31}

in conformally-flat space. In this article, the work above has been extended by
giving a coordinate-\emph{independent} expression for these TT tensors. The
translational and axial symmetry conditions have also been generalized to

Nuclei (AGN) were known to generate relativistic jets and thus to emit up to
the gamma-ray energy range: blazars and radio galaxies, both hosted in giant
elliptical galaxies. The first four years of observations by the Large Area

the most numerous identified sources in the extragalactic gamma-ray sky, but
the discovery of variable gamma-ray emission from 5 radio-loud Narrow-Line
Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies revealed the presence of a possible emerging third
class of AGN with relativistic jets. Considering that NLSy1 are thought to be
hosted in spiral galaxies, this finding poses intriguing questions about the
nature of these objects, the knowledge of the development of relativistic jets,
and the evolution of radio-loud AGN. In this context, the study of the
radio-loud NLSy1 from radio to gamma-rays has received increasing attention.
Here we discuss the radio-to-gamma-rays properties of the gamma-ray emitting
NLSy1, also in comparison with the blazar scenario.

constrain the physical properties of both the molecular disk and outflow, the
presence of a highly-ionized ultra-fast nuclear wind, and their connection. The
molecular outflow has a size of ~1 kpc, and extends in all directions around
the nucleus, being more prominent along the south-west to north-east direction,
suggesting a wide-angle biconical geometry. The maximum projected velocity of
the outflow is nearly constant out to ~1 kpc, thus implying that the density of
the outflowing material decreases from the nucleus outwards as $r^{-2}$. This
suggests that either a large part of the gas leaves the flow during its
expansion or that the bulk of the outflow has not yet reached out to ~1 kpc,
thus implying a limit on its age of ~1 Myr. We find $\dot M_{OF}=[ 500-1000]~
M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ and $\dot E_{kin,OF}=[7-10]\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Remarkably, our analysis of the X-ray data reveals a nuclear ultra-fast outflow

yr^{-1}$, and momentum load $\dot P_{UFO}/\dot P_{rad}=[0.2-1.6]$.We find $\dot
E_{kin,UFO}\sim \dot E_{kin,OF}$ as predicted for outflows undergoing an energy
conserving expansion. This suggests that most of the UFO kinetic energy is
transferred to mechanical energy of the kpc-scale outflow, strongly supporting
that the energy released during accretion of matter onto super-massive black
holes is the ultimate driver of giant massive outflows. We estimate a momentum
boost $\dot P_{OF}/\dot P_{UFO}\approx [30-60]$. The ratios $\dot E_{kin,
UFO}/L_{bol,AGN} =[ 1-5]\%$ and $\dot E_{kin,OF}/L_{bol,AGN} = [1-3]\%$ agree
with the requirements of the most popular models of AGN feedback.

data sets. We reconstruct the projected matter distribution from a joint
weak-lensing analysis of 2D shear and azimuthally integrated magnification
constraints, the combination of which allows us to break the mass-sheet
degeneracy. The resulting mass distribution reveals elongation with axis ratio
~0.7 in projection. When assuming a spherical halo, our full weak-lensing

combining weak/strong lensing and X-ray/SZE data with minimal geometric
assumptions. We show that the data favor a triaxial geometry with minor-major

quite elongated with minor-major axis ratio 0.60+/-0.14. The gas mass fraction

first look at the space of lexicographic preferences and show that, as opposed
to the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we show
that although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when the
number of objects is less than or equal agents, it is strictly manipulable when
there are more objects than agents. In the space of general preferences, we
provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS, analyze
economic properties, and provide further insights on the applicability of each

non-thermal emission from the coronal source, and EUV spectroscopy from the
Hinode/EIS, which scanned the coronal source during the impulsive peak, to
analyse Doppler shifts in Fe XII and Fe XXIV emission lines, and determine the
source density. The coronal source exhibited an impulsive emission lightcurve
in all AIA filters during the impulsive phase. RHESSI hard X-ray images
indicate both thermal and non-thermal emission at the coronal source, and its
plasma temperature derived from RHESSI imaging spectroscopy shows an impulsive
rise, reaching a maximum at 12-13 MK about 10 seconds prior to the hard X-ray
peak. High redshifts associated with this bright source indicate downflows of
40-250 km/s at a broad range of temperatures, interpreted as loop shrinkage
and/or outflows along the magnetic field. Outflows from the coronal source
towards each ribbon are also observed by AIA images at 171, 193, 211, 304 and
1600 A. The electron density of the source obtained from a Fe XIV line pair is
$10^{11.50}$ which is collisionally thick to electrons with energy up to 45-65
keV, responsible for the source's non-thermal X-ray emission. We conclude that
the bright coronal source is the location of the main release of magnetic
energy in this flare, with a geometry consistent with component reconnection
between crossing, current-carrying loops. We argue that the energy that can be
released via reconnection, based on observational estimates, can plausibly
account for the non-thermal energetics of the flare.

makes these systems an interesting resource for storing encoded quantum bits.
To perform a quantum gate on this encoded information, however, complex
nonlinear operations must be applied to the many levels of the oscillator
simultaneously. In this work, we introduce the Selective Number-dependent
Arbitrary Phase (SNAP) gate, which imparts a different phase to each Fock state
component using an off-resonantly coupled qubit. We show that the SNAP gate
allows control over the quantum phases by correcting the unwanted phase
evolution due to the Kerr effect. Furthermore, by combining the SNAP gate with
oscillator displacements, we create a one-photon Fock state with high fidelity.
Using just these two controls, one can construct arbitrary unitary operations,
offering a scalable route to performing logical manipulations on
oscillator-encoded qubits.

or mostly accretion and only weak winds, and galaxies where winds are roughly
balanced by accretion. The three groups are distinct in the properties of their

gain have low metallicity, atomic hydrogen dominated gas disks with a flat
spatial profile. The other two groups have gas disks dominated by molecular

that, in some sense, the random polytope achieves its best statistical accuracy

evaluating the $\alpha$-decay half-lives is presented, in which the hindrance
effect resulted from the change of the ground state spins and parities of
parent and daughter nuclei is included, together with a new correction factor
for nuclei near the shell closures. The calculated $\alpha$-decay half-lives
are found to be in better agreements with the experimental data, and the
corresponding root-mean-square (rms) deviation is reduced to $0.433$ when the
experimental $Q$-values are employed. Furthermore, the $Q$-values derived from
different nuclear mass models are used to predict $\alpha$-decay half-lives
with this improved formula. It is found that the calculated half-lives are very
sensitive to the $Q$-values. Remarkably, when mass predictions are improved
with the radial basis function (RBF), the resulting rms deviations can be
significantly reduced. With the mass prediction from the latest version of
Weizs\""{a}cker-Skyrme (WS4) model, the rms deviation of $\alpha$-decay
half-lives with respect to the known data falls to $0.697$.

combined with potential barriers. We assume that the system is in the vicinity
of the quantum phase transition to a Mott insulator at a commensurate filling,
where emergent particle-hole symmetry gives rise to two types of collective
mode, namely a gapless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase mode and a gapful Higgs
amplitude mode. We consider two kinds of potential barrier: One does not break
the particle-hole symmetry while the other does. In the presence of the former
barrier, we find Higgs bound states that have binding energies lower than the
bulk Higgs gap and are localized around the barrier. We analyze tunneling
properties of the NG mode incident to both barriers to show that the latter
barrier couples the Higgs bound states with the NG mode, leading to Fano
resonance mediated by the bound states. Thanks to the universality of the
underlying field theory, it is expected that Higgs bound states may be present
also in other condensed matter systems with a particle-hole symmetry and
spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry, such as quantum dimer
antiferromagnets, superconductors, and charge-density-wave materials.

the excitation power dependence of these scattering processes is theoretically
described by an effective Hamiltonian that includes correlation between the

channels. Using data sets of 6.6e20 protons on target (P.O.T.) in the LAr1-ND

estimate that a search for muon neutrino to electron neutrino appearance can be
performed with ~5 sigma sensitivity for the LSND allowed (99% C.L.) parameter
region. In this proposal for the SBN Program, we describe the physics analysis,
the conceptual design of the LAr1-ND detector, the design and refurbishment of
the T600 detector, the necessary infrastructure required to execute the
program, and a possible reconfiguration of the BNB target and horn system to
improve its performance for oscillation searches.

intriguing quantum-mechanical properties. Robust control over the chemical
potential of TI materials is important if these states are to become useful in
new technologies, or as a venue for exotic physics. Unfortunately, chemical
potential tuning is challenging in TIs in part because the fabrication of
electrostatic top-gates tends to degrade material properties and the addition
of chemical dopants or adsorbates can cause unwanted disorder. Here, we present
an all-optical technique which allows persistent, bidirectional gating of a
(Bi,Sb)2Te3 channel by optically manipulating the distribution of electric
charge below its interface with an insulating SrTiO3 substrate. In this fashion
we optically pattern p-n junctions in a TI material, which we subsequently
image using scanning photocurrent microscopy. The ability to dynamically write
and re-write mesoscopic electronic structures in a TI may aid in the
investigation of the unique properties of the topological insulating phase. The
optical gating effect may be adaptable to other material systems, providing a

volumes which LOFAR produces, combined with the scientific requirement for
rapid response, make automation essential. To support this, we have developed
the LOFAR Transients Pipeline, or TraP. The TraP ingests multi-frequency image

clustering. Although the normalized cut algorithm applies the K-means algorithm
to the eigenvectors of a normalized graph Laplacian for finding clusters, our
algorithm instead uses a minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid for them. We show
that the algorithm shares similarity with the ellipsoidal rounding algorithm
for separable nonnegative matrix factorization. Our theoretical insight implies
that the algorithm can serve as a bridge between spectral clustering and
separable NMF. The K-means algorithm has the issues in that the choice of
initial points affects the construction of clusters and certain choices result
in poor clustering performance. The normalized cut algorithm inherits these
issues since K-means is incorporated in it, whereas the algorithm proposed here
does not. An empirical study is presented to examine the performance of the
algorithm.

Since $R$ is Gorenstein, $M$ has a complete injective resolution, so it is
natural to ask what one gets by applying the $\frak{a}$-torsion functor to it.
Following this lead, we define stable local cohomology for modules with

supplemented 15 Li-rich K giants discovered from this sample with 25 known
Li-rich K giants from other studies. Dust shell evolutionary models and
spectral energy distributions were constructed using the code DUSTY to estimate
different dust shell properties, such as dust evolutionary time scales, dust
temperatures, and mass-loss rates. Among 2000 K giants, we found about two
dozen K giants with detectable far-IR excess, and surprisingly, none of them
are Li-rich. Similarly, the 15 new Li-rich K giants that were identified from
the same sample show no evidence of IR excess. Of the total 40 Li-rich K
giants, only 7 show IR excess. Important is that K giants with Li enhancement
and/or IR excess begin to appear only at the bump on the RGB. Results show that
K giants with IR excess are very rare, similar to K giants with Li enhancement.
This may be due to the rapid differential evolution of dust shell and Li
depletion compared to RGB evolutionary time scales. We also infer from the
results that during the bump evolution, giants probably undergo some internal
changes, which are perhaps the cause of mass-loss and Li-enhancement events.
However, the available observational results do not ascertain that these
properties are correlated. That a few Li-rich giants have IR excess seems to be
pure coincidence.

Biophysically, unidirectional motion of large number of motor proteins along a

(TASEP). From which many meaningful properties, such as the appearance of
domain wall (defined as the borderline of high density and low density of motor
protein along motion track) and boundary layers, can be obtained. However, it
is biologically obvious that a single track may be occupied by different motor
species. So previous studies based on TASEP of one particle species are not
reasonable enough to find more detailed properties of the motion of motors
along a single track. To address this problem, TASEP with two particle species
is discussed in this study. Theoretical methods to get densities of each
particle species are provided. Using these methods, phase transition related
properties of particle densities are obtained. Our analysis show that domain
wall and boundary layer of single species densities always appear
simultaneously with those of the total particle density. The height of domain

The mechanism of nematicity that is likely tied to the pairing mechanism of
high-Tc, however, still remains controversial. Here, we studied the electronic
structure of multilayer FeSe film by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). We found that the FeSe film enters the nematic state around 125 K,
while the electronic signature of long range magnetic order has not been
observed down to 20K indicating the non-magnetic origin of the nematicity. The
band reconstruction in the nematic state is characterized by the splitting of
the dxz and dyz bands. More intriguingly, such energy splitting is strong
momentum dependent with the largest band splitting of ~80meV at the zone
corner. The simple on-site ferro-orbital ordering is insufficient to reproduce
the nontrivial momentum dependence of the band reconstruction. Instead, our
results suggest that the nearest-neighbor hopping of dxz and dyz is highly
anisotropic in the nematic state, the origin of which holds the key in
understanding the nematicity in iron-based superconductors.

vision. With growing image sizes (2D and 3D), it is now highly desirable to run
energy minimization algorithms in parallel. But many existing algorithms, in
particular, some efficient combinatorial algorithms, are difficult to

reformulate the quadratic energy minimization problem as a total variation
denoising problem, which, when viewed geometrically, enables the use of
projection and reflection based convex methods. The resulting min-cut algorithm
(and code) is conceptually very simple, and solves a sequence of TV denoising

On small problems the iterative convex methods match the combinatorial max-flow
algorithms, while on larger problems they offer other flexibility and important
gains: (a) their memory footprint is small; (b) their straightforward
parallelizability fits multi-core platforms; (c) they can easily be
warm-started; and (d) they quickly reach approximately good solutions, thereby
enabling faster ""inexact"" solutions. A key consequence of our approach based on
submodularity and convexity is that it is allows to combine any arbitrary

rotational frequency of PSR J0738-4042 changed abruptly in 2005. Originally,
the spin-down rate was relatively stable, with the rotational frequency
derivative of $-1.14 \times 10^{-14}~\rm s^{-2}$. After September 2005, the
derivative began to rise up. About 1000 days later, it arrived at another
relatively stable value of about $-0.98 \times 10^{-14}~\rm s^{-2}$, indicating
that the pulsar is spinning-down relatively slowly. To explain the observed
spin-down rate change, we resort to an asteroid disrupted by PSR J0738-4042. In
our model, the orbital angular momentum of the asteroid is assumed to be
parallel to that of the rotating pulsar, so that the pronounced reduction in
the spin-down rate can be naturally explained as due to the transfer of the
angular momentum from the disrupted material to the central pulsar. The derived
magnetospheric radius is about $4.0 \times 10^{9}$ cm, which is smaller than
the tidal disruption radius ($4.9 \times 10^{10}$ cm). Our model is
self-consistent. It is shown that the variability of the spin-down rate of PSR
J0738-4042 can be quantitatively accounted for by the accretion from the
asteroid disrupted by the central pulsar.

regarding the temporal evolution of the disorder-averaged displacement field
induced by a shear transformation, which turns out to coincide with the
response of a uniform elastic medium. However, fluctuations are relatively
large, and their magnitude is satisfactorily captured by the FE simulations of
an elastically heterogeneous system. Besides, accounting for elastic anisotropy
on the mesoscale is not crucial in this respect. The proposed method thus paves

materials at room temperature is a key property for spintronics. Investigating
the Heusler compound Co$_2$MnSi a value of 93$\%$ for the spin polarization has
been observed at room temperature, where the high spin polarization is related
to a stable surface resonance in the majority band extending deep into the
bulk. In particular, we identified in our spectroscopical analysis that this
surface resonance is embedded in the bulk continuum with a strong coupling to
the majority bulk states. The resonance behaves very bulk-like, as it extends
over the first six atomic layers of the corresponding (001)-surface. Our study
includes experimental investigations, where the bulk electronic structure as
well as surface-related features have been investigated using spin-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (SR-UPS) and for a larger probing depth
spin-integrated high energy x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). The
results are interpreted in comparison with first-principles band structure and
photoemission calculations which consider all relativistic, surface and
high-energy effects properly.

high-dimensional data, where it generalizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Recently, several methods have been proposed to enhance the robustness of PCA
and SC, while most of them are computationally very expensive, in particular,
for high dimensional large-scale data. In this paper, we develop much faster
iterative algorithms for SC, incorporating robustness using a {\em non-squared}
$\ell_2$-norm objective. The known implementations for optimizing the objective
would be costly due to the alternative optimization of two separate objectives:
optimal cluster-membership assignment and robust subspace selection, while the
substitution of one process to a faster surrogate can cause failure in
convergence. To address the issue, we use a simplified procedure requiring
efficient matrix-vector multiplications for subspace update instead of solving
an expensive eigenvector problem at each iteration, in addition to release
nested robust PCA loops. We prove that the proposed algorithm monotonically
converges to a local minimum with approximation guarantees, e.g., it achieves
2-approximation for the robust PCA objective. In our experiments, the proposed
algorithm is shown to converge at an order of magnitude faster than known
algorithms optimizing the same objective, and have outperforms prior subspace
clustering methods in accuracy and running time for MNIST dataset.

two-tiered microbial food chain and a slightly more complex three-tiered
microbial food web, with their stability analysed as function of the inflowing
substrate concentration and dilution rate. Parameterised for phenol and
chlorophenol degradation, steady-states were always stable and non-oscillatory.
Low input concentrations of chlorophenol were sufficient to maintain
chlorophenol- and phenol-degrading populations but resulted in poor conversion
and a hydrogen flux that was too low to sustain hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
The addition of hydrogen and phenol boosted the populations of all three
organisms, resulting in the counterintuitive phenomena that (i) the phenol
degraders were stimulated by adding hydrogen, even though hydrogen inhibits
phenol degradation, and (ii) the dechlorinators indirectly benefitted from
measures that stimulated their hydrogenotrophic competitors; both phenomena
hint at emergent behaviour.

study collective coin-flipping: the problem of generating a common bounded-bias
bit in a network of $n$ players with $t=t(n)$ faults. They showed that the
majority protocol can tolerate $t=O(\sqrt n)$ adaptive corruptions, and
conjectured that this is optimal in the adaptive setting. Lichtenstein, Linial,
and Saks proved that the conjecture holds for protocols in which each player
sends a single bit. Their result has been the main progress on the conjecture
in the last 30 years.
  In this work we revisit this question and ask: what about protocols involving
longer messages? Can increased communication allow for a larger fraction of
faulty players?
  We introduce a model of strong adaptive corruptions, where in each round, the
adversary sees all messages sent by honest parties and, based on the message
content, decides whether to corrupt a party (and intercept his message) or not.
We prove that any one-round coin-flipping protocol, regardless of message
length, is secure against at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt n)$ strong adaptive
corruptions. Thus, increased message length does not help in this setting.
  We then shed light on the connection between adaptive and strongly adaptive
adversaries, by proving that for any symmetric one-round coin-flipping protocol
secure against $t$ adaptive corruptions, there is a symmetric one-round
coin-flipping protocol secure against $t$ strongly adaptive corruptions.
Returning to the standard adaptive model, we can now prove that any symmetric
one-round protocol with arbitrarily long messages can tolerate at most
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt n)$ adaptive corruptions.
  At the heart of our results lies a novel use of the Minimax Theorem and a new
technique for converting any one-round secure protocol into a protocol with
messages of $polylog(n)$ bits. This technique may be of independent interest.

game but has the particular feature that all agent are coupled only through a
simple random event (the seminar starting time) that they all contribute to
form. In the mean field limit, this event becomes deterministic and its value
can be fixed through a self consistent procedure. This allows for a rather
thorough understanding of the solutions of the problem, through both exact
results and a detailed analysis of various limiting regimes. For a sensible
class of initial configurations, distinct behaviors can be associated to
different domains in the parameter space . For this reason, the 'seminar

Standard Model (SM) its branching ratio for the decay into two neutrinos is
helicity suppressed and predicted to be $Br(K_L \to \nu \bar{\nu}) \lesssim
10^{-10}$. We consider several natural extensions of the SM, such as
two-Higgs-doublet (2HDM), 2HDM and light scalar, and mirror dark matter models,
those main feature is that they allow to avoid the helicity suppression factor
and lead to an enhanced $Br(K_L \to invisible)$. For the decay $K_L \to \nu
\bar{\nu}$ the smallness of the neutrino mass in the considered 2HDM model is
explained by the smallness of the second Higgs doublet vacuum expectation
value. The small nonzero value of the second Higgs isodoublet can arise as a
consequence of nonzero quark condensate. We show that taking into account the
most stringent constraints from the $K \to \pi +invisible$ decay, this process
could be in the region of $Br(K_L \to invisible) \simeq 10^{-8}-10^{-6}$, which
is experimentally accessible. In some scenarios the $K_L \to invisible$ decay
could still be allowed while the $K \to \pi +invisible$ decay is forbidden. The
results obtained show that the $K_L \to invisible$ decay is a clean probe of
new physics scales well above 100 TeV, that is complementary to rare $K \to
\pi+invisible$ decay, and provide a strong motivation for its sensitive search
in a near future experiment.

the treatment effect identifiable and then sensitivity analysis is conducted to
assess how inference about the treatment effect changes as the untestable

instrument calibration and the unknown temperature distribution of the emitting
plasma. While significant deviations are found for the abundances of Fe and Ca
from flare to flare, the abundances averaged over all flares are found to be
enhanced over photospheric values by factors of $1.66 \pm 0.34$ (Fe),
$3.89~\pm~0.76$ (Ca), $1.23~\pm~0.45$ (S), $1.64~\pm~0.66$ (Si), and

more clearly observed in the upper critical field and less pronounced in the
critical temperature. The magnetic field dependence of the vortex related
microwave losses in a film with periodic pinning reveals a reduced dissipation
of mobile vortices in the stimulated regime due to a reduction of the core

planet's Roche lobe. The derived ~10% transit absorption depths require
super-thermal processes and/or supersolar abundances. From subsequent Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph (COS) observations, CII absorption was reported with
tentative velocity signatures, and absorption by SiIII ions was also claimed in
disagreement with a negative STIS G140L detection. Here, we revisit the COS
dataset showing a severe limitation in the published results from having
contrasted the in-transit spectrum against a stellar spectrum averaged from
separate observations, at planetary phases 0.27, 0.72, and 0.49. We find
variable stellar SiIII and CII emissions that were significantly depressed not
only during transit but also at phase 0.27 compared to phases 0.72 and 0.49.
Their respective off-transit 7.5 and 3.1% flux variations are large compared to
their reported 8.2+/-1.4% and 7.8+/-1.3% transit absorptions. Significant
variations also appear in the stellar line shapes, questioning reported
velocity signatures. We furthermore present archive STIS G140M transit data
consistent with no SiIII absorption, with a negative result of 1.7+/-18.7
including ~15% variability. Silicon may still be present at lower ionization
states, in parallel with the recent detection of extended magnesium, as MgI

fraction of the hot subdwarf population is indeed found in close binaries. In a
large project we search for the close binary sdBs with the most and the least
massive companions. Significantly enhancing the known sample of close binary
sdBs we performed the first comprehensive study of this population. Triggered

substellar companions is an important channel to form sdB stars. Finally, we
discovered a unique and very compact binary system consisting of an sdB and a

challenging especially because, even after removing the foregrounds, the
residual Stokes $I$ maps contain leakage from polarized emission that can mimic
the signal. Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of LOFAR and present
realistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR
observations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the
level of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and
compared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at
134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\rightarrow
I$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The
leakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of
the leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to
vary between 0.2-0.3\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of
leakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization
leakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the PSF-induced wedge and below
$k_\parallel\sim 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to
$k_\parallel\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\perp$ when 70\% of the leakage had
been removed. These LOFAR results show that even a modest polarimetric
calibration over a field of view of $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in the future arrays
like SKA will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the
expected EoR signal at the scales of 0.02-1 Mpc$^{-1}$.

represent complicated geometries may lead to negative coefficients when using
piecewise linear finite elements. Several methods have been proposed to modify
the coefficients to enforce the non-negativity needed in the stochastic

error between the analytical solutions to the original and the perturbed
equations, is bounded by the backward error, the error between the diffusion of
the two equations. We present a backward analysis algorithm to compute the

a new way of deriving non-negative jump coefficients that minimizes the

turbulence and magnetic field morphologies on their evolution and star
formation properties. We vary the mass per unit length of the filaments as well
as the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the major axis. We
find that the filaments, which have no or a perpendicular magnetic field,
typically reveal a smaller width than the universal width of 0.1 pc proposed by
e.g. Arzoumanian et al. 2011. We show that this also holds in the presence of
supersonic turbulence and that accretion driven turbulence is too weak to
stabilize the filaments along their radial direction. On the other hand, we
find that a magnetic field that is parallel to the major axis can stabilize the
filament against radial collapse resulting in widths of 0.1 pc. Furthermore,
depending on the filament mass and magnetic field configuration, gravitational
collapse and fragmentation in filaments occurs either in an edge-on way,
uniformly distributed across the entire length, or in a mixed way. In the
presence of initially moderate density perturbations, a centralized collapse
towards a common gravitational centre occurs. Our simulations can thus
reproduce different modes of fragmentation observed recently in star forming
filaments. Moreover, we find that turbulent motions influence the distance
between individual fragments along the filament, which does not always match
the results of a Jeans analysis.

disk is expected to be formed in the central kilo parsec of the remnant of

SMBHs occurs more quickly when the mean density of the CND is higher, due to
increased dynamical friction. However, in simulations where the CND is
fragmented in high density gaseous clumps (clumpy CND), the orbits of the SMBHs
are erratically perturbed by the gravitational interaction with these clumps,
delaying, in some cases, the orbital decay of the SMBHs. The densities of these
gaseous clumps in our simulations and in recent studies of clumpy CNDs are
significantly higher than the observed density of molecular clouds in isolated
galaxies or ULIRGs, thus, we expect that SMBH orbits are perturbed less in real
CNDs than in the simulated CNDs of this study and other recent studies. We also
find that the migration timescale has a weak dependence on the star formation
rate of the CND. Furthermore, the migration timescale of a SMBH pair in a
star-forming clumpy CND is at most a factor three longer than the migration
timescale of a pair of SMBHs in a CND modeled with more simple gas physics.
Therefore, we estimate that the migration timescale of the SMBHs in a clumpy
CND is on the order of $10^7$ yrs.

parametrically excited due to the interaction with the quantized photon mode.
One of the channels of such a process is the dynamical Lamb effect, induced by
a nonadiabatic modulation of atomic level Lamb shift. However, in experiments
with natural atoms it is quite difficult to isolate this effect from other
mechanisms of atom excitation. We point out that a transmission line cavity
coupled with a superconducting qubit (artificial macroscopic atom) provides a
unique platform for the observation of the dynamical Lamb effect. A key idea is
to exploit a dynamically tunable qubit-resonator coupling, which was
implemented quite recently. By varying nonadiabatically the coupling, it is
possible to parametrically excite a qubit through a nonadiabatic modulation of
the Lamb shift, even if the cavity was initially empty. A dynamics of such a
coupled system is studied within the Rabi model with time-dependent coupling
constant and beyond the rotating wave approximation. An efficient method to
increase the effect through the periodic and nonadiabatic switching of a
qubit-resonator coupling energy is proposed.

and the time-convolution reciprocity theorem in Fourier domain, there is the
modified mutual energy theorem and the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Hence all
mutual energy theorem and the reciprocity theorems are put in one frame of the
concept of the mutual energy. 3 new Complementary theorems are derived. The
inner product is introduced for two different electromagnetic fields in both
time domain and Fourier domain for the application of the wave expansion.

the k-labelled spanning forest (kLSF) problem by an intelligent Variable
Neighbourhood Search (Int-VNS) metaheuristic. In the kLSF problem we are given
an undirected input graph G and an integer positive value k, and the aim is to
find a spanning forest of G having the minimum number of connected components
and the upper bound k on the number of labels to use. The problem is related to
the minimum labelling spanning tree (MLST) problem, whose goal is to get the
spanning tree of the input graph with the minimum number of labels, and has
several applications in the real world, where one aims to ensure connectivity
by means of homogeneous connections. The Int-VNS metaheuristic that we propose
for the kLSF problem is derived from the promising intelligent VNS strategy
recently proposed for the MLST problem, and integrates the basic VNS for the
kLSF problem with other complementary approaches from machine learning,
statistics and experimental algorithmics, in order to produce high-quality
performance and to completely automate the resulting strategy.

The
new object is called the hyperbolic Pascal triangle since the mathematical
background goes back to regular mosaics on the hyperbolic plane. We describe
precisely the procedure of how to obtain a given type of hyperbolic Pascal
triangle from a mosaic. Then we study certain quantitative properties such as
the number, the sum, and the alternating sum of the elements of a row.
Moreover, the pattern of the rows, and the appearence of some binary
recurrences in a fixed hyperbolic triangle are investigated.
