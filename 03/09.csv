over the range of plausible theoretical uncertainties and determine confidence
level contours in the rho bar eta bar plane. We determine alpha from branching
fraction and CP asymmetry measurements of B decays to all light
pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar, pesudoscalar-vector, vector-vector and
a1-psudoscalar mesons and determine gamma from D(*)K(*), D(*) pi and D rho

triangle. We parametrize the individual decay amplitudes in terms of
color-allowed tree, color-suppressed tree, gluonic penguin, singlet penguin,
electroweak penguin, as well as W-exchange and W-annihilation amplitudes. Our
procedure accounts for all correlations among the fitted CKM parameters (rho
bar, eta bar, A, lambda). The data are consistent with the Standard Model with

against ground truth. This measure, which we call Tolerant Edit Distance (TED),
is motivated by two observations: (1) Some errors, like small boundary shifts,
are tolerable in practice. Which errors are tolerable is application dependent
and should be a parameter of the measure. (2) Non-tolerable errors have to be
corrected manually. The time needed to do so should be reflected by the error
measure. Using integer linear programming, the TED finds the minimal weighted
sum of split and merge errors exceeding a given tolerance criterion, and thus
provides a time-to-fix estimate. In contrast to commonly used measures like
Rand index or variation of information, the TED (1) does not count small, but
tolerable, differences, (2) provides intuitive numbers, (3) gives a time-to-fix
estimate, and (4) can localize and classify the type of errors. By supporting
both isotropic and anisotropic volumes and having a flexible tolerance
criterion, the TED can be adapted to different requirements. On example
segmentations for 3D neuron segmentation, we demonstrate that the TED is
capable of counting topological errors, while ignoring small boundary shifts.

  Issue on Recent Advances in Heterogeneous Networks",,"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2435273",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, there has been an increasing
interest in deploying small cells of higher frequency bands underlying the
conventional homogeneous macrocell network, which is usually referred to as
heterogeneous cellular networks, to significantly boost the overall network
capacity. With vast amounts of spectrum available in the millimeter wave
(mmWave) band, small cells at mmWave frequencies are able to provide
multi-gigabit access data rates, while the wireless backhaul in the mmWave band
is emerging as a cost-effective solution to provide high backhaul capacity to
connect access points (APs) of the small cells. In order to operate the mobile
network optimally, it is necessary to jointly design the radio access and
backhaul networks. Meanwhile, direct transmissions between devices should also
be considered to improve system performance and enhance the user experience. In
this paper, we propose a joint transmission scheduling scheme for the radio
access and backhaul of small cells in the mmWave band, termed D2DMAC, where a
path selection criterion is designed to enable device-to-device transmissions
for performance improvement. In D2DMAC, a concurrent transmission scheduling
algorithm is proposed to fully exploit spatial reuse in mmWave networks.
Through extensive simulations under various traffic patterns and user
deployments, we demonstrate D2DMAC achieves near-optimal performance in some
cases, and outperforms other protocols significantly in terms of delay and
throughput. Furthermore, we also analyze the impact of path selection on the
performance improvement of D2DMAC under different selected parameters.

complementary ultraviolet (UV), optical, and NIR data, of the Type Ia supernova
(SN Ia) iPTF13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated time
of explosion. The first NIR spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosion
and may be the earliest NIR spectrum yet obtained of a SN Ia. The most striking
features in the spectrum are several NIR C I lines, and the C I {\lambda}1.0693
{\mu}m line is the strongest ever observed in a SN Ia. Interestingly, no strong
optical C II counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopic
time series began early and is densely-cadenced. Except at the very early
epochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strong
NIR C I compared to the weaker optical C II appears to be general in SNe Ia.
iPTF13ebh is a fast decliner with {\Delta}m15(B) = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.01, and its
absolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. It
is therefore categorized as a ""transitional"" event, on the fast-declining end
of normal SNe Ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iPTF13ebh shows
NIR spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal and
subluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the two
classes. These NIR observations suggest composition and density of the inner
core similar to that of 91bg-like events, and a deep reaching carbon burning
layer not observed in slower declining SNe Ia. There is also a substantial
difference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curve
and the velocity evolution of the Si II {\lambda}0.6355 {\mu}m line, implying a
long dark phase of ~ 4 days.

introduces a novel hybrid timing model to make runtime predictions on the

the timing as optimization constraints. This timing model allows multiple

performance. The timing model also provides a convenient way to check the
schedulability of messages on the CAN at runtime. Simulation results
demonstrate that the timing model is accurate and computationally efficient to
meet the needs of real-time implementation. Simulation results also demonstrate
that model predictive controllers designed when considering the timing

pressure changes could also affect chemical properties of mid-ocean ridge
volcanism. We consider how changing sea-level could alter the CO2 emissions
rate from mid-ocean ridges, on both the segment and global scale. We develop a
simplified transport model for a highly incompatible element through a
homogenous mantle; variations in the melt concentration the emission rate of
the element are created by changes in the depth of first silicate melting. The
model predicts an average global mid-ocean ridge CO2 emissions-rate of 53
Mt/yr, in line with other estimates. We show that falling sea level would cause
an increase in ridge CO2 emissions with a lag of about 100 kyrs after the

phase oscillators with randomly distributed natural frequencies. In our model
each oscillator stochastically switches its phase to the ensemble-averaged
value $\psi$ at a typical rate which is proportional to the degree of phase
coherence $r$. The system exhibits a continuous phase transition to collective
synchronization similar to classical Kuramoto model. Based on the
self-consistent arguments and on the linear stability analysis of an incoherent
state we derive analytically the threshold value $k_c$ of coupling constant
corresponding to the onset of a partially synchronized state. Just above the
transition point the linear scaling law $r\propto k-k_c$ is found. We also show
that nonlinear relation between rate of phase correction and order parameter
leads to non-trivial transition between incoherence and synchrony. To
illustrate our analytical results, numerical simulations have been performed
for a large population of phase oscillators with proposed type of coupling. The
results of this work could become useful in designing distributed networked
systems capable of self-synchronization.

the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models:
in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz

  However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure atomic

energy, symmetry, or as an ""exact"" symmetry, following from the conservation
laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators
may lead to new type of (table-top) experiments, that shall be used to study

propose an explicit shaping scheme to remove this mod-$\Lambda_s$ front end and
extend polar lattices to the genuine Gaussian wiretap channel. The shaping
technique is based on the lattice Gaussian distribution, which leads to a
binary asymmetric channel at each level for the multilevel lattice codes. By
employing the asymmetric polar coding technique, we construct an AWGN-good

result, the encoding complexity for the sender and the decoding complexity for
the legitimate receiver are both O(N logN log(logN)). The proposed scheme is

polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole
Telescope. The observations used in this work were taken during 2012 and early
2013 and include data in spectral bands centered at 95 and 150 GHz. We report
the $BB$ spectrum in five bins in multipole space, spanning the range $300 \le
\ell \le 2300$, and for three spectral combinations: 95 GHz $\times$ 95 GHz, 95
GHz $\times$ 150 GHz, and 150 GHz $\times$ 150 GHz. We subtract small ($< 0.5
\sigma$ in units of statistical uncertainty) biases from these spectra and
account for the uncertainty in those biases. The resulting power spectra are
inconsistent with zero power but consistent with predictions for the $BB$
spectrum arising from the gravitational lensing of $E$-mode polarization. If we
assume no other source of $BB$ power besides lensed $B$ modes, we determine a
preference for lensed $B$ modes of $4.9 \sigma$. After marginalizing over
tensor power and foregrounds, namely polarized emission from galactic dust and
extragalactic sources, this significance is $4.3 \sigma$. Fitting for a single
parameter, $A_\mathrm{lens}$, that multiplies the predicted lensed $B$-mode
spectrum, and marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, we find
$A_\mathrm{lens} = 1.08 \pm 0.26$, indicating that our measured spectra are
consistent with the signal expected from gravitational lensing. The data
presented here provide the best measurement to date of the $B$-mode power

virality. We create an attribute-based characterization of images that can
predict relative virality with 68.10% accuracy (SVM+Deep Relative Attributes)

through the application of Noether's theorem. We show that these quantities
exhibit unphysical behavior: they depend on the choice of a gauge potential in
the spin Lagrangian and can be made arbitrary. To resolve this problem, we
exploit a similarity between the dynamics of a ferromagnetic soliton and that
of a charged particle in a magnetic field. For the latter, canonical momentum
is also gauge-dependent and thus unphysical; the physical momentum is the
generator of magnetic translations, a symmetry combining physical translations
with gauge transformations. We use this analogy to unambiguously define
conserved momenta for ferromagnetic solitons. General considerations are
illustrated on simple models of a domain wall in a ferromagnetic chain and of a
vortex in a thin film.

learns the gradient direction from data. The method allows to simultaneously
solve for shape and pose parameters. Our method is thoroughly evaluated on
Morphable Model generated data and first results on real data are presented.
Compared to traditional fitting methods, which use simple raw features like
pixel colour or edge maps, local features have been shown to be much more
robust against variations in imaging conditions. Our approach is unique in that

reservoirs and the central system is a small quantum system linking these two
reservoirs. If there is a temperature differential, then heat and entropy will
flow from one part of the chain to the other. We consider the Evans-Searles and
Gallavotti-Cohen functionals which describe the fluctuations of this flux with
respect to the initial state of the system and the non-equilibrium steady state
reached by the system in the large time limit. We also define the full counting
statistics for the XY chain and consider the associated entropic functional, as
well a natural class of functionals that interpolate between the full counting
statistics functional and the direct quantization of the variational
characterization of the Evans-Searles functional which appears in classical
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The Jordan-Wigner transformation
associates a free Fermi gas and Jacobi matrix to our XY chain. Using this

The
soundness of the proposed model is investigated by focusing primarily on
mesoscopic properties elaborated from the spectra of the graph Laplacian. To
complement the analysis, we study also classical topological descriptors, such
as statistics of the shortest paths and the important feature of modularity.
Our experiments show that the proposed model results in a considerable
improvement with respect to two suitably chosen generative mechanisms,
mimicking with better approximation real protein contact networks in terms of
diffusion properties elaborated from the Laplacian spectra. However, as well as
the other considered models, it does not reproduce with sufficient accuracy the
shortest paths structure. To compensate this drawback, we designed a second
step involving a targeted edge reconfiguration process. The ensemble of
reconfigured networks denotes improvements that are statistically significant.
As a byproduct of our study, we demonstrate that modularity, a well-known
property of proteins, does not entirely explain the actual network architecture
characterizing protein contact networks. In fact, we conclude that modularity,
intended as a quantification of an underlying community structure, should be
considered as an emergent property of the structural organization of proteins.
Interestingly, such a property is suitably optimized in protein contact
networks together with the feature of path efficiency.

  from pointwise data",,,,,"math.NA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of approximating a smooth function from finitely-many
pointwise samples using $\ell^1$ minimization techniques. In the first part of
this paper, we introduce an infinite-dimensional approach to this problem.
Three advantages of this approach are as follows. First, it provides
interpolatory approximations in the absence of noise. Second, it does not
require \textit{a priori} bounds on the expansion tail in order to be
implemented. In particular, the truncation strategy we introduce as part of
this framework is independent of the function being approximated, provided the
function has sufficient regularity. Third, it allows one to explain the key
role weights play in the minimization; namely, that of regularizing the problem
and removing aliasing phenomena. In the second part of this paper we present a
worst-case error analysis for this approach. We provide a general recipe for
analyzing this technique for arbitrary deterministic sets of points. Finally,
we use this tool to show that weighted $\ell^1$ minimization with Jacobi
polynomials leads to an optimal method for approximating smooth,
one-dimensional functions from scattered data.

distributed large-scale graph computations, we study a number of fundamental
graph problems in a message-passing model for distributed computing where $k
\geq 2$ machines jointly perform computations on graphs with $n$ nodes
(typically, $n \gg k$). The input graph is assumed to be initially randomly
partitioned among the $k$ machines, a common implementation in many real-world
systems. Communication is point-to-point, and the goal is to minimize the
number of communication rounds of the computation.
  Our main result is an (almost) optimal distributed randomized algorithm for
graph connectivity. Our algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(n/k^2)$ rounds
($\tilde{O}$ notation hides a $\poly\log(n)$ factor and an additive
$\poly\log(n)$ term). This improves over the best previously known bound of
$\tilde{O}(n/k)$ [Klauck et al., SODA 2015], and is optimal (up to a
polylogarithmic factor) in view of an existing lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n/k^2)$. Our improved algorithm uses a bunch of techniques,
including linear graph sketching, that prove useful in the design of efficient
distributed graph algorithms. Using the connectivity algorithm as a building
block, we then present fast randomized algorithms for computing minimum
spanning trees, (approximate) min-cuts, and for many graph verification
problems. All these algorithms take $\tilde{O}(n/k^2)$ rounds, and are optimal
up to polylogarithmic factors. We also show an almost matching lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n/k^2)$ rounds for many graph verification problems by
leveraging lower bounds in random-partition communication complexity.

measures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and
compare them, and which ones to select for constructing patent technology
network maps. This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of
such technology maps. Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance
measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and
similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps.
Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and International Patent
Classification system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which
quantify inter-field knowledge base proximity, field-crossing diversification
likelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent
classes in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest the patent
technology network maps based on normalized co-reference and inventor
diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.

atoms of a ladder-type three-state energy configuration. Our approach is based
on the spatial coherent control scheme which utilizes counter-propagating
ultrashort laser pulses to produce complex excitation patterns in an extended
space. Since coherent control requires constructive interference of constituent
transition pathways, applying it to an atomic transition with a specific energy
configuration requires specially designed laser pulses. Here, we show, in an
experimental demonstration, that the two-photon transition with an intermediate
resonant energy state can be coherently controlled and retrieved out from the
resonance-induced background, when phase-flipping of the laser spectrum near
the resonant intermediate transition is used. A simple reason for this behavior
is the fact that the transition amplitude function (to be added to give an
overall two-photon transition) changes its sign at the intermediate resonant
frequency, thus, by a proper spectral-phase programming, the excitation
patterns (or the position-dependent interference of the transition given as a
consequence of the spatial coherent control) are well isolated in space along
the focal region of the counter-propagating pulses.

in contrast to other, suboptimal decoding rules that have been used in the

single-letter formulas for the random coding error exponents. We compare our
results with the best known lower bound on the error exponent, and show that
our exponents can be strictly better. Then, in the second part of this paper,
we consider more complicated coding ensembles, and find a lower bound on the

semantic fashion/body regions, is formulated as an Active Template Regression
(ATR) problem, where the normalized mask of each fashion/body item is expressed
as the linear combination of the learned mask templates, and then morphed to a
more precise mask with the active shape parameters, including position, scale
and visibility of each semantic region. The mask template coefficients and the
active shape parameters together can generate the human parsing results, and
are thus called the structure outputs for human parsing. The deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to build the end-to-end relation between the
input human image and the structure outputs for human parsing. More
specifically, the structure outputs are predicted by two separate networks. The
first CNN network is with max-pooling, and designed to predict the template
coefficients for each label mask, while the second CNN network is without
max-pooling to preserve sensitivity to label mask position and accurately
predict the active shape parameters. For a new image, the structure outputs of
the two networks are fused to generate the probability of each label for each
pixel, and super-pixel smoothing is finally used to refine the human parsing
result. Comprehensive evaluations on a large dataset well demonstrate the
significant superiority of the ATR framework over other state-of-the-arts for
human parsing. In particular, the F1-score reaches $64.38\%$ by our ATR
framework, significantly higher than $44.76\%$ based on the state-of-the-art

Supernova Remnants and Pulsar Wind Nebulae, which being close and bright, are
the best studied among astrophysical accelerators. These sources are held
responsible for most of the energy that is put in relativistic particles in the

Thanks to a local homogeneity hypothesis, whose validity is discussed,
simplified balance equations are obtained. This original approach solves the
problem of dependence of some variables on the size of the averaging domain
obtained in previous approaches which can lead to huge relative errors (several
hundred percentages). It also clearly separates affine and nonaffine fields in
the balance equations. The resulting energy cascade picture is discussed, with
a particular focus on unidirectional steady and fully developed flows for which
it appears that the contact terms are dissipated locally unlike the kinetic

the full name and the description as ""state"" is associated with support,
whereas abbreviations usually indicate opposition. We then ""go back in time"" by
analyzing the historic timelines of both users supporting and opposing and look
at their pre-ISIS period to gain insights into the antecedents of support. To
achieve this, we build a classifier using pre-ISIS data to ""predict"", in
retrospect, who will support or oppose the group. The key story that emerges is
one of frustration with failed Arab Spring revolutions. ISIS supporters largely
differ from ISIS opposition in that they refer a lot more to Arab Spring
uprisings that failed. We also find temporal patterns in the support and
opposition which seems to be linked to major news, such as reported territorial
gains, reports on gruesome acts of violence, and reports on airstrikes and

\AA\ bump and thus any enhancement in the abundance of small dust grains and
PAHs in the dust grains size distribution. This technique is applied to the
envelope of the TMC, mapped by the GALEX All Sky Survey (AIS). UV and IR
photometric data have been retrieved from the GALEX-AIS and the 2MASS

the cloud envelope where the 2175 \AA\ bump is weaker than in the diffuse ISM

the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input

linear-in-mass-ratio corrections to the spin-precession angle and tidal
invariants for a particle in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole.
We extract coefficients up to 20pN order from numerical results that are
calculated with an accuracy greater than 1 part in $10^{500}$. These results
can be used to calibrate parameters in effective-one-body models of compact
binaries, specifically the spin-orbit part of the effective Hamiltonian and the
dynamically significant tidal part of the main radial potential of the
effective metric. Our calculations are performed in a radiation gauge, which is
known to be singular away from the particle. To overcome this irregularity, we
define suitable Detweiler-Whiting singular and regular fields in this gauge,
and we devise a rigorous mode-sum regularization method to compute the
invariants constructed from the regular field.

Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS) is an extension of the GMRT Radio Halo Survey (GRHS)
designed to search for radio halos using GMRT 610/235 MHz observations. The
GRHS+EGRHS consists of 64 clusters in the redshift range 0.2 -- 0.4 that have
an X-ray luminosity larger than 5x10^44 erg/s in the 0.1 -- 2.4 keV band and
with declinations > -31 deg in the REFLEX and eBCS X-ray cluster catalogues. In
this second paper in the series, GMRT 610/235 MHz data on the last batch of 11
galaxy clusters and the statistical analysis of the full sample are presented.
A new mini-halo in RXJ2129.6+0005 and candidate diffuse sources in Z5247, A2552
and Z1953 are discovered. A unique feature of this survey are the upper limits
on the detections of 1 Mpc sized radio halos; 4 new are presented here making a
total of 31 in the survey. Of the sample, 58 clusters that have adequately
sensitive radio information were used to obtain the most accurate occurrence
fractions so far. The occurrence of radio halos in our X-ray selected sample is
~22%, that of mini-halos is 13% and that of relics is ~5%. The radio power -
X-ray luminosity diagrams for the radio halos and mini-halos with the
detections and upper limits are presented. The morphological estimators namely,
centroid shift (w), concentration parameter (c) and power ratios (P_3/P_0)
derived from the Chandra X-ray images are used as proxies for the dynamical

occupy distinct quadrants in the c-w, c-P_3/P_0 and w - P_3/P_0 planes,
corresponding to the more and less morphological disturbance, respectively. The
non-detections span both the quadrants.

understanding the properties of cosmic ray electrons (CREs) and the
interstellar medium (ISM). We determine the synchrotron spectral index
($\alpha_{\rm nt}$) of four nearby star-forming galaxies, namely NGC 4736, NGC
5055, NGC 5236 and NGC 6946 at sub-kpc linear scales. The $\alpha_{\rm nt}$ was
determined between 0.33 and 1.4 GHz for all the galaxies. We find the spectral
index to be flatter ($\gtrsim -0.7$) in regions with total neutral (atomic +
molecular) gas surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm gas} \gtrsim \rm 50~M_\odot
pc^{-2}$, typically in the arms and inner parts of the galaxies. In regions
with $\Sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim \rm 50~M_\odot pc^{-2}$, especially in the
interarm and outer regions of the galaxies, the spectral index steepens sharply
to $<-1.0$. The flattening of $\alpha_{\rm nt}$ is unlikely to be caused due to
thermal free--free absorption at 0.33 GHz. Our result is consistent with the
scenario where the CREs emitting at frequencies below $\sim0.3$ GHz are
dominated by bremsstrahlung and/or ionization losses. For denser medium
($\Sigma_{\rm gas} \gtrsim \rm 200~M_\odot pc^{-2}$), having strong magnetic
fields ($\sim 30~\mu$G), $\alpha_{\rm nt}$ is seen to be flatter than $-0.5$,
perhaps caused due to ionization losses. We find that, due to the clumpy nature
of the ISM, such dense regions cover only a small fraction of the galaxy

indication of such loss mechanisms and remain a power-law over a wide range of
radio frequencies (between $\sim 0.1$ to 10 GHz).

If $b|Q|>1/2$, then an associated black hole must have a minimum irreducible

irreducible mass. For larger irreducible masses, single horizon structures
raise again. By assuming that black holes emit thermal uncharged scalar
particles, we further show in light of the black hole mass decomposition that
one satisfying $b|Q|>1/2$ takes an infinite amount of time to reach the zero

SWEET-Cat online catalogue. Methods. To ensure that the catalogue is
homogeneous, we use our standard spectroscopic analysis procedure, ARES+MOOG,
to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. These
spectroscopic stellar parameters are then used as input to compute the stellar
mass and radius, which are fundamental for the derivation of the planetary mass
and radius. Results. We show that the spectroscopic parameters, masses, and

databases of exoplanets. There are some exceptions, especially for the evolved
stars. These are analyzed in detail focusing on the effect of the stellar mass
on the derived planetary mass. Conclusions. We conclude that the stellar mass
estimations for giant stars should be managed with extreme caution when using
them to compute the planetary masses. We report examples within this sample
where the differences in planetary mass can be as high as 100% in the most
extreme cases.

crude simplifications, have been devoted to investigate this possible scenario,
compared with the large efforts invested to study some other scenarios. Here we
perform the first three-dimensional simulations of the merger phase, and find
that this process can lead to the formation of a massive white dwarf, as
required by this scenario. We consider two situations, according to the mass of
the circumbinary disk formed around the system during the final stages of the
common envelope phase. If the disk is massive enough, the stars merge on a
highly eccentric orbit. Otherwise, the merger occurs after the circumbinary
disk has been ejected and gravitational wave radiation has brought the stars
close to the Roche lobe radius on a nearly circular orbit. Not surprisingly,
the overall characteristics of the merger remnants are similar to those found
for the double-degenerate (DD) scenario, independently of the very different
core temperature and of the orbits of the merging stars. They consist of a
central massive white dwarf, surrounded by a hot, rapidly rotating corona and a
thick debris region.

important on macroscopic scales. Controlling these coherently on a single
particle level is essential for the tailored preparation of strongly correlated

atoms offer such strong interactions which lead to extreme nonlinearities in
laser coupled atomic ensembles. As a result, multiple excitation of a
Micrometer sized cloud can be blocked while the light-matter coupling becomes
collectively enhanced. The resulting two-level system, often called
""superatom"", is a valuable resource for quantum information, providing a
collective Qubit. Here we report on the preparation of two orders of magnitude
scalable superatoms utilizing the large interaction strength provided by
Rydberg atoms combined with precise control of an ensemble of ultracold atoms
in an optical lattice. The latter is achieved with sub shot noise precision by
local manipulation of a two-dimensional Mott insulator. We microscopically
confirm the superatom picture by in-situ detection of the Rydberg excitations

$\ds\to pp \pi^0\pi^-$, and $\ds\to nn \pi^+\pi^0$ channels are also extracted.
Further including the estimated partial width for the $\ds\to pn $ process, the
total width of the $\ds$ resonance is obtained. In the first step of the
practical calculation, the effect of the dynamical structure on the width of
$\ds$ is studied in the single $\Delta\Delta$ channel approximation. It is
found that the width is reduced by few tens of MeV, in comparison with the one
obtained by considering the effect of the kinematics only. This presents the
importance of such effect from the dynamical structure. However, the obtained
width with the single $\Delta\Delta$ channel wave function is still too large
to explain the data. It implies that the $\ds$ resonance will not consist of
the $\Delta\Delta$ structure only, and instead there should be enough room for
other structure such as the hidden-color (CC) component. Thus, in the second
step, the width of $\ds$ is further evaluated by using a wave function obtained
in the coupled $\Delta\Delta$ and CC channel calculation in the framework of
the Resonating Group Method (RGM). It is shown that the resultant total width
for $\ds$ is about 69 MeV, which is compatible with the experimental
observation of about 75 MeV and justifies our assertion that the $\ds$
resonance is a hexaquark-dominated exotic state.

always a center of interest in the underlying physics of unconventional
superconductors. The quantum phase transition between Mott insulator with AFM
and superconductor can be induced by doping charge carriers in high-Tc cuprate
superconductors. For the best characterized organic superconductors of
k-(BEDT-TTF)2X (X=anion), a first order transition between AFM insulator and
superconductor can be tuned by applied external pressure or chemical pressure.
Also, the superconducting state can be directly developed from AFM insulator by
application of pressure in Cs3C60. The resemblance of these phase diagrams
hints a universal mechanism governing the unconventional superconductivity in
close proximity to AFM insulators. However, the superconductivity in iron-based
high-Tc superconductors evolves from an AFM bad metal by doping charge
carriers, and no superconductor-insulator transition has been observed so far.
Here, we report a first-order transition from superconductor to insulator with
a strong charge doping induced by ionic gating in the thin flakes of single
crystal (Li,Fe)OHFeSe. The Tc is continuously enhanced with electron doping by
ionic gating up to a maximum Tc of 43 K, and a striking
superconductor-insulator transition occurs just at the verge of optimal doping
with highest Tc. A novel phase diagram of temperature-gating voltage with the
superconductor-insulator transition is mapped out, indicating that the
superconductor -insulator transition is a common feature for unconventional
superconductivity. These results help to uncover the underlying physics of
iron-based superconductivity as well as the universal mechanism of high-Tc
superconductivity. Our finding also suggests that the gate-controlled strong
charge doping makes it possible to explore novel states of matter in a way
beyond traditional methods.

systems (IFSs) prove more versatile than classical interpolants. However, the
applications of FIFs in the domain of `shape preserving interpolation' are not
fully addressed so far. Among various techniques available in the classical
numerical analysis, rational interpolation schemes are well suited for the
shape preservation problems and shape modification analysis. In this paper, the
capability of FIFs to generalize smooth classical interpolants, and the
effectiveness of rational function models in shape preservation are
intertwingly exploited to provide a new solution to the shape preserving
interpolation problem in fractal perspective. As a common platform for these
two techniques to work together, we introduce rational cubic spline FIFs
involving tension parameters for the first time in literature. Suitable
conditions on parameters of the associated IFS are developed so that the
rational fractal interpolant inherits fundamental shape properties such as
monotonicity, convexity, and positivity present in the given data. With some
suitable hypotheses on the original function, the convergence analysis of the
$\mathcal{C}^1$-rational cubic spline FIF is carried out. Due to the presence
of the scaling factors in the rational cubic spline fractal interpolant, our
approach generalizes the classical results on the shape preserving rational
interpolation by Delbourgo and Gregory [SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput., 6 (1985),
pp. 967-976]. The effectiveness of the shape preserving interpolation schemes
are illustrated with suitably chosen numerical examples and graphs, which
support the practical utility of our methods.

Observatory (SDO) provides coronal EUV imaging over a broader temperature
sensitivity range than the previous generations of instruments (EUVI, EIT, and
TRACE). Differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) of the solar corona
based on AIA data is presented here for the first time. The main product of
DEMT is the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the local differential
emission measure (LDEM). While in previous studies, based on EIT or EUVI data,
there were 3 available EUV bands, with a sensitivity range $\sim 0.60 - 2.70$
MK, the present study is based on the 4 cooler AIA bands (aimed at studying the
quiet sun), sensitive to the range $\sim 0.55 - 3.75$ MK. The AIA filters allow
exploration of new parametric LDEM models. Since DEMT is better suited for
lower activity periods, we use data from Carrington Rotation 2099, when the Sun
was in its most quiescent state during the AIA mission. Also, we validate the
parametric LDEM inversion technique by applying it to standard bi-dimensional
(2D) differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on sets of simultaneous AIA
images, and comparing the results with DEM curves obtained using other methods.
Our study reveals a ubiquitous bimodal LDEM distribution in the quiet diffuse
corona, which is stronger for denser regions. We argue that the nanoflare
heating scenario is less likely to explain these results, and that alternative
mechanisms, such as wave dissipation appear better supported by our results.

via a straightforward collocation method. This is ubiquitous in all areas of
computational physics and quantum chemistry. An example in Density Functional
Theory (DFT) is given by the external potential or the pseudo-potential
describing the interaction between ions and electrons. The accuracy of the
collocation method used is therefore very important for the reliability of
subsequent treatments like self-consistent field solutions of the electronic
structure problems. By construction, the collocation method introduces
numerical artifacts typical of real-space treatments, like the so-called
egg-box error, that may spoil the numerical stability of the description when
the real-space grid is too coarse. As the external potential is an input of the
problem, even a highly precise computational treatment cannot cope this
inconvenience. We present in this paper a new quadrature scheme that is able to
exactly preserve the moments of a given analytic function even for large grid
spacings, while reconciling with the traditional collocation method when the
grid spacing is small enough. In the context of real-space electronic structure
calculations, we show that this method improves considerably the stability of
the results for large grid spacings, opening the path towards reliable
low-accuracy DFT calculations with reduced number of degrees of freedom.

radio occultation measurements. A localized refractivity slope variation near
1.2 bars was interpreted to be the result of a condensed CH4 cloud layer.
However, models fit to near-IR spectra found particle concentrations in the
1.5-3 bar range (Sromovsky et al. 2006, Icarus 182, 577-593, Sromovsky and Fry
2008, Icarus 193, 211-229, Irwin et al. 2010, Icarus 208, 913-926), and a
recent analysis of STIS spectra argued that aerosol particles formed diffusely
distributed hazes, with no compact condensation layer (Karkoschka and Tomasko
2009, Icarus 202, 287-309). Trying to reconcile these results, we reanalyzed
the occultation observations with a He volume mixing ratio reduced from 0.15 to
0.116, which is near the edge of the 0.033 range given by Conrath et al. (1987,
J. Geophys. Res., 15003-10). This allowed us to obtain saturated CH4 mixing
ratios within the putative cloud layer and to reach above-cloud and deep CH4
mixing ratios compatible with STIS spectral constraints. Using a 5-layer
vertical aerosol model with two compact cloud layers in the 1-3 bar region, we
find that the best fit pressure for the upper layer is virtually identical to
the pressure range inferred from the occultation analysis for a methane mixing
ratio near 4% at 5 deg S, arguing that Uranus does indeed have a compact
methane cloud layer. While our cloud model can fit the latitudinal variations
in spectra between 30 deg S and 20 deg N using the same temperature and CH4
profiles, closer to the pole, the model requires the introduction of an
increasingly strong upper tropospheric depletion of CH4 at increased latitudes,
in rough agreement with the trend identified by Karkoschka and Tomasko (2009,
Icarus 202, 287-309).

the tradeoff between market power and uncertainty reduction as a function of
group size. In particular, we compare the welfare and output obtained with
coalitional competition, with the same benchmarks when output is controlled by
a single system operator. We show when there are $N$ firms present, competition
between groups of size $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ results in equilibria that are
socially optimal in terms of welfare and groups of size $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ are
socially optimal in terms of production. We also extend our results to the case

faithfully retrieve the spectra of the detected faint companions was also
considered.} {We found that the application of the updated version of the

properly taken into account, gives us a $5\sigma$ limiting contrast of the
order of 5$\times$$10^{-6}$ or slightly better. The further application of the
angular differential imaging procedure on these data should allow us to improve
the contrast by one order of magnitude down to around 7$\times$$10^{-7}$ at a
separation of 0.3 arcsec. The application of a principal components analysis
procedure that simultaneously uses spectral and angular data gives comparable
results. Finally, we found that the reproducibility of the spectra of the

bigravity is affected by early-time fast growing modes on the tensor sector.
Here we argue that we can only trust the linear analysis up to when
perturbations are in the linear regime and use a cut-off to stop the growing of
the metric perturbations. This analysis, although more consistent, still leads
to growing tensor modes that are unacceptably large for the theory to be
compatible with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), both in
temperature and polarization spectra. In order to suppress the growing modes
and make the model compatible with CMB spectra, we find it necessary to either
fine-tune the initial conditions, modify the theory or set the cut-off for the
tensor perturbations of the second metric much lower than unity. Initial
conditions such that the growing mode is sufficiently suppresed can be achieved
in scenarios in which inflation ends at the GeV scale.

the positions of sources from the VIDEO survey. In the former case, the
algorithm recovers the counts correctly when applied to the catalogue, but is
biased high when confusion comes into play. This needs to be accounted for in
the analysis of data from any relatively-low-resolution SKA pathfinders. For
the latter case, the observed radio source counts remain flat below the 5-sigma
level of 85 microJy as far as 40 microJy, then fall off earlier than the flux
hinted at by the SKADS simulations and a recent P(D) analysis (which is the
only other measurement from the literature at these flux-density levels, itself
extrapolated in frequency). Division into galaxy type via spectral-energy
distribution reveals that normal spiral galaxies dominate the counts at these
fluxes.

insulating state. In this material, the approximate energy scale of a variety
of interactions, involving spin-orbit coupling, magnetic exchange interaction,
and the Mott gap, allows close coupling among the corresponding physical
excitations, opening the possibility of cross control of the physical
properties. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the effective gate control of
both the transport and magnetism in a Sr2IrO4-based field effect transistor
using an ionic liquid dielectric. This approach could go beyond the
surface-limited field effect seen in conventional transistors, reflecting the
unique aspect of the Jeff=1/2 state. The simultaneous modulation of conduction
and magnetism confirms the proposed intimate coupling of charge, orbital, and
spin degrees of freedom in this oxide. These phenomena are probably related to
an enhanced deviation from the ideal Jeff=1/2 state due to the gate-promoted
conduction. The present work would have important implications in modelling the
unusual physics enabled by strong spin-orbit coupling, and provides a new route

genetics/epigenetics to cognitive psychology and behavioral economics. We argue
that the information interpretation of quantum mechanics (its various forms
were elaborated by Zeilinger and Brukner, Fuchs and Mermin, and D' Ariano) is
the most natural interpretation of QIB. We also point out that QBIsm (Quantum
Bayesianism) can serve to find a proper interpretation of bio-quantum
probabilities. Biologically QIB is based on two principles: a) adaptivity; b)
openness (bio-systems are fundamentally open). These principles are
mathematically represented in the framework of a novel formalism -- quantum
adaptive dynamics which, in particular, contains the standard theory of open
quantum systems as a special case of adaptivity (to environment).

that it is intractable to optimally price the grand bundle of multiple items

three instances of how different properties of implicit distributions can lead
to intractability: the first is a #P-hardness proof, while the remaining two

simple pricing schemes can oftentimes approximate the best scheme in revenue,
they can have drastically different underlying structure. We argue therefore
that either the specification of the input distribution must be highly

applications such as intelligent agriculture, pipeline fault diagnosis, mine

The key challenge to realize WUSNs is the wireless communication in underground
environments. Most existing wireless communication systems utilize the dipole
antenna to transmit and receive propagating electromagnetic (EM) waves, which
do not work well in underground environments due to the very high material
absorption loss. The Magnetic Induction (MI) technique provides a promising
alternative solution that could address the current problem in underground.
Although the MI-based underground communication has been intensively
investigated theoretically, to date, seldom effort has been made in developing
a testbed for the MI-based underground communication that can validate the
theoretical results. In this paper, a testbed of MI-based communication system
is designed and implemented in an in-lab underground environment. The testbed
realizes and tests not only the original MI mechanism that utilizes single coil
but also recent developed techniques that use the MI waveguide and the
3-directional (3D) MI coils. The experiments are conducted in an in-lab
underground environment with reconfigurable environmental parameters such as
soil composition and water content. This paper provides the principles and
guidelines for developing the MI underground communications testbed, which is
very complicated and time-consuming due to the new communication mechanism and
the new wireless transmission medium.

paper aims to reveal the impact of key software parameters on hardware energy
consumption, by establishing an energy model for a standard GPS receiver
architecture as found in both academic and industrial designs. In particular,
our measurements show that the receiver's energy consumption is in large part
linear with the number of tracked satellites. This leads to a design of
selective tracking algorithm that provides similar positioning accuracy (around
12m) with a subset of selected satellites, which translates to an energy saving
of 20.9-23.1\% on the Namuru board.

trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The scheme relies on the possibility
of producing different potentials simultaneously for two internal atomic
states. The atoms are coherently transferred, via a Rabi coupling between the
two long-lived internal states, from a single well potential to a double-well.
We present numerical simulations supporting our proposal and confirming
excellent efficiency and fidelity of the transfer process with realistic
numbers for a BEC of $^{87}$Rb. We discuss the experimental implementation by
suggesting state-selective microwave potentials as an ideal tool to be
exploited for magnetically trapped atoms. The working principles of this
technique are tested on our atom chip device which features an integrated
coplanar micro-wave guide. In particular, the first realization of a
double-well potential by using a microwave dressing field is reported.
Experimental results are presented together with numerical simulations, showing
good agreement. Simultaneous and independent control on the external potentials
is also demonstrated in the two Rubidium clock states. The transfer between the
two states, featuring respectively a single and a double-well, is characterized
and it is used to measure the energy spectrum of the atoms in the double-well.
Our results show that the spatial overlap between the two states is crucial to
ensure the functioning of the beamsplitter. Even though this condition could
not be achieve in our current setup, the proposed technique can be realized
with current state-of-the-art devices being particularly well suited for atom
chip experiments. We anticipate applications in quantum enhanced
interferometry.

transmission efficiency in such channels exceeding 0.8, in optimized geometry.
We infer that protein molecules make up the channels, proposing a qualitative

means for multi-target tracking due to its capability of handling an unknown
and time-varying number of targets in non-linear non-Gaussian system. However,
its computational complexity grows linearly with the number of measurements and
particles assigned to each target, and this can be very time consuming
especially when numerous targets and clutter exist in the surveillance region.
Addressing this issue, we present a distributed computation particle PHD filter
for target tracking. Its framework consists of several local particle PHD
filters at each processing element and a central unit. Each processing element
takes responsibility for part particles but full measurements and provides
local estimates; central unit controls particle exchange between processing
elements and specifies a fusion rule to match and fuse the estimates from
different local filters. The proposed framework is suitable for parallel
implementation and maintains the tracking accuracy. Simulations verify the
proposed method can provide comparative accuracy as well as a significant
speedup with the standard particle PHD filter.

equations is introduced. It is developed for re-rating purposes in general
insurance. A nonlinear transformation $\varphi $ of a d-dimensional $(d \ge 2)$
Euclidean space is introduced that enables us to express the system in the form
$f^{t+1}:=\varphi (f^t),\, t=0,\, 1,\, 2,\, \ldots $. Under typical actuarial
assumptions, existence of solutions of that system is proven by means of
Brouwer's fixed point theorem in normed spaces. In addition, conditions that
guarantee uniqueness of a solution are given. The second, smaller part of the
article is about Leslie-Gower's system of $d \ge 2$ difference equations. We
focus on the system that satisfies conditions consistent with weak
inter-specific competition. We prove existence and uniqueness of the
equilibrium of the model under surprisingly simple and very general conditions.
Even though the two parts of this article have applications in two different
sciences, they are connected with similar mathematics, in particular by our use

longitudinal electric field does not necessarily lead to the breakdown of gauge
invariance. The total time derivative term in the matter-EM field interaction
in the Lagrangian is canceled out by the choice of Coulomb gauge. The remaining
interaction is described by transverse vector potential and the longitudinal
electric field which is the homogeneous solution of Gauss law. This leads
directly to the gauge invariant forms of the linear and nonlinear constitutive
equations. It is discussed how to reconcile this result with the cases of an
isolated matter interacting with external charges.

biological processes take place, while the motions of involved
particles/molecules under thermal fluctuations are usually analyzed using the
conventional theory of diffusive Brownian motion based on both sufficiently
long time averaging and assumptions of spherical particle shapes. Here, using
molecular dynamics simulations, we show that asymmetrically shaped
nanoparticles in dilute solutions possess spontaneous directional motion of the
center of mass within a finite time interval. The driving force for this
unexpected directional motion lies in the imbalance of the interactions
experienced by their constituent atoms during the orientation regulation at
timescales before the onset of diffusive Brownian motion. Theoretical formulae
have been derived to describe the mean displacement and the variance of this
directional motion. Our study potentially takes an important step towards
establishing a complete theoretical framework for describing the motions of
variously-shaped particles in solutions over all timescales from ballistic to
diffusive regime.
