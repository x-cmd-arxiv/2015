holomorphic function $\phi(z)$ in a vertical strip of $\mathbb{C}$ satisfying
exponential bounds as the imaginary part grows. We arrive at this result using
transforms from fractional calculus. This affords us the ability to
indefinitely sum more complicated functions than previously possible; such as
holomorphic functions of order $n \in \mathbb{N}$ that have decay at plus or
minus imaginary infinity. We then further investigate the indefinite summation
operator by restricting ourselves to a space of functions of exponential type.
We arrive at a second representation for the indefinite summation operator,
equivalent to the first presented, and show we have defined a unique operator
on this space. We develop a convolution using the indefinite sum that is
commutative, associative, and distributive over addition. We arrive at a
formula for the complex iterates of the indefinite sum (the differsum), using
this convolution, that resembles the Riemann-Liouville differintegral. We close
with a generalization of the Gamma function.

neutral particles, which are produced in the fragmentation of hard scattered
partons in an early stage of the collision. The measurement of jet spectra in
p-Pb collisions provides an important way of quantifying the effects of cold
nuclear matter in the initial state on jet production, fragmentation, and
hadronization. Unlike in Pb-Pb collisions, strong hot nuclear matter effects -
e.g. from quark-gluon plasma formation - are not expected to occur in p-Pb
collisions. Hence, cold nuclear matter effects can be investigated in
isolation. The impact of cold nuclear matter effects on charged jet spectra is
expected to depend on the event centrality. Higher event centralities are
principally connected to a higher probability for an interaction of proton and
lead-nucleus and therefore also for a possible nuclear modification. This
article is the conference proceeding of a talk, in which centrality-dependent
properties of charged jets in p-Pb measured by ALICE were shown for the first
time. The focus is here on the fully corrected jet production cross sections
and the nuclear modification factors. Additionally, the jet radial structure is
explored by comparing jet spectra reconstructed with different resolution

variant, where a clique of size k is planted in a random G(n, 1/2) graph, have
been the focus of substantial study in algorithm design. Despite much effort,
the best known polynomial-time algorithms only solve the problem for k ~
sqrt(n).
  In this paper we study the complexity of the planted clique problem under
algorithms from the Sum-of-squares hierarchy. We prove the first average case
lower bound for this model: for almost all graphs in G(n,1/2), r rounds of the
SOS hierarchy cannot find a planted k-clique unless k > n^{1/2r} (up to
logarithmic factors). Thus, for any constant number of rounds planted cliques
of size n^{o(1)} cannot be found by this powerful class of algorithms. This is
shown via an integrability gap for the natural formulation of maximum clique
problem on random graphs for SOS and Lasserre hierarchies, which in turn follow
from degree lower bounds for the Positivestellensatz proof system.
  We follow the usual recipe for such proofs. First, we introduce a natural
""dual certificate"" (also known as a ""vector-solution"" or ""pseudo-expectation"")

fixed input graph. Then we show that the matrix associated with this dual

theory of association schemes, and in particular the eigenspaces and
eigenvalues of the Johnson scheme. Another is a combinatorial method we develop

propose an unsupervised model compression framework for this general problem of

bootstrap model into a small model by taking the bootstrap model and its
application together as a black box and learning a mapping function from the
input of the bootstrap model to the output of the application by a supervised
learner. To specialize the framework, we propose a new technique, named
compressive MBN. It takes MBN as the unsupervised bootstrap model and deep
neural network (DNN) as the supervised learner. Our initial result on MNIST
showed that compressive MBN not only maintains the high prediction accuracy of
MBN but also is over thousands of times faster than MBN at the prediction
stage. Our result suggests that the new technique integrates the effectiveness

steady zonal flows. Starting from the Hasegawa--Mima equation, we employ both
the quasilinear approximation and a statistical average, which retains a great
deal of the qualitative behavior of the full system. Within the resulting
framework known as CE2, we extend recent understanding of the symmetry-breaking
`zonostrophic instability'. Zonostrophic instability can be understood in a
very general way as the instability of some turbulent background spectrum to a
zonally symmetric coherent mode. As a special case, the background spectrum can
consist of only a single mode. We find that in this case the dispersion
relation of zonostrophic instability from the CE2 formalism reduces exactly to
that of the 4-mode truncation of generalized modulational instability. We then
show that zonal flows constitute pattern formation amid a turbulent bath.
Zonostrophic instability is an example of a Type I$_s$ instability of
pattern-forming systems. The broken symmetry is statistical homogeneity. Near
the bifurcation point, the slow dynamics of CE2 are governed by a well-known
amplitude equation, the real Ginzburg-Landau equation. The important features
of this amplitude equation, and therefore of the CE2 system, are multiple.
First, the zonal flow wavelength is not unique. In an idealized, infinite
system, there is a continuous band of zonal flow wavelengths that allow a
nonlinear equilibrium. Second, of these wavelengths, only those within a
smaller subband are stable. Unstable wavelengths must evolve to reach a stable
wavelength; this process manifests as merging jets. These behaviors ...

space $({\mathbb C^n})^{\otimes N}$ are considered. Two criteria are given for
determining when an orthogonal projection matrix $P$ of a rank $r$ gives rise
to such a representation. The first of them is the equality of traces of
certain matrices and the second is the unitary condition for a certain
partitioned matrix. Some estimates are obtained on the lower bound of $Q$ for a
given dimension $n$ and rank $r$. It is also shown that if $4r>n^2$, then $Q$
can take only a discrete set of values determined by the value of $n^2/r$. In
particular, the only allowed value of $Q$ for $n=r=2$ is $Q=\sqrt{2}$. Finally,
properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the quantum Hopf algebra
$U_q(su_2)$ are used in order to find all $r=1$ and $r=2$ unitary tensor space
representations of $TL_N(Q)$ such that $Q$ depends continuously on $q$ and $P$
is the projection in the tensor square of a simple $U_q(su_2)$ module on the
subspace spanned by one or two joint eigenvectors of the Casimir operator $C$
and the generator $K$ of the Cartan subalgebra.

years, it can still be difficult to obtain in certain scenarios. In particular,
acquiring ground truth 3D shapes of objects pictured in 2D images remains a
challenging feat and this has hampered progress in recognition-based object
reconstruction from a single image. Here we propose to bypass previous
solutions such as 3D scanning or manual design, that scale poorly, and instead
populate object category detection datasets semi-automatically with dense,
per-object 3D reconstructions, bootstrapped from:(i) class labels, (ii) ground
truth figure-ground segmentations and (iii) a small set of keypoint
annotations. Our proposed algorithm first estimates camera viewpoint using
rigid structure-from-motion and then reconstructs object shapes by optimizing
over visual hull proposals guided by loose within-class shape similarity
assumptions. The visual hull sampling process attempts to intersect an object's
projection cone with the cones of minimal subsets of other similar objects
among those pictured from certain vantage points. We show that our method is
able to produce convincing per-object 3D reconstructions and to accurately
estimate cameras viewpoints on one of the most challenging existing

distributed antenna system (MR-FFR-DAS) constitute a pair of virtual-MIMO based
technical options for achieving high spectral efficiency in
interference-limited cellular networks. In practice both techniques have their
respective pros and cons, which are studied in this paper by evaluating the
achievable cell-edge performance on the uplink of multicell systems. We show
that assuming the same antenna configuration in both networks, the maximum
available cooperative spatial diversity inherent in the MR-FFR-DAS is lower
than that of the CoMP-CAS. However, when the cell-edge MSs have a low
transmission power, the lower-complexity MR-FFR-DAS relying on the simple
single-cell processing may outperform the CoMP-CAS by using the proposed
soft-combining based probabilistic data association (SC-PDA) receiver, despite
the fact that the latter scheme is more complex and incurs a higher cooperation
overhead. Furthermore, the benefits of the SC-PDA receiver may be enhanced by
properly selecting the MRs' positions. Additionally, we show that the
performance of the cell-edge MSs roaming near the angular direction halfway
between two adjacent RAs (i.e. the ""worst-case direction"") of the MR-FFR-DAS
may be more significantly improved than that of the cell-edge MSs of other
directions by using multiuser power control, which also improves the fairness
amongst cell-edge MSs. Our simulation results show that given a moderate MS
transmit power, the proposed MR-FFR-DAS architecture employing the SC-PDA
receiver is capable of achieving significantly better bit-error rate (BER) and
effective throughput across the entire cell-edge area, including even the

that star formation has not yet altered the environment. The lack of thermal
radio emission places the cloud in an early stage of evolution, which we expect
to be short-lived ($\lesssim 1$~Myr) and thus rare. Given its mass and kinetic
energy, for the cloud to be confined (as its appearance strongly suggests) it
must be subject to an external pressure of P/$k_B \gtrsim 10^8$~K~cm$^{-3}$ --
10,000 times higher than typical interstellar pressure. This would support
theories that high pressures are required to form globular clusters and may
explain why extreme environments like the Antennae are preferred environments

deconstructs free will into the causally open ""free"" stage with its closure in
the ""will"" stage, is implicitly a move in this direction. However, to avoid the
dilemma of determinism, free will additionally requires an infinite regress of
causal meta-stages, making free choice a hypertask. We use this model to define
free will of the rationalist-compatibilist type. This is shown to provide a
natural three-way distinction between quantum indeterminism, freedom and free
will, applicable respectively to artificial intelligence (AI), animal agents
and human agents. We propose that the causal hierarchy in our model corresponds
to a hierarchy of Turing uncomputability. Possible neurobiological and

opportunity to study real-world complex networks of interactions. However,
releasing this data to researchers and the public comes at the cost of
potentially exposing private and sensitive user information. It has been shown
that a naive anonymization of a network by removing the identity of the nodes
is not sufficient to preserve users' privacy. In order to deal with malicious
attacks, k-anonymity solutions have been proposed to partially obfuscate
topological information that can be used to infer nodes' identity.
  In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring k-anonymity in time-varying
graphs, i.e., graphs with a structure that changes over time, and multi-layer
graphs, i.e., graphs with multiple types of links. More specifically, we
examine the case in which the attacker has access to the degree of the nodes.
The goal is to generate a new graph where, given the degree of a node in each
(temporal) layer of the graph, such a node remains indistinguishable from other
k-1 nodes in the graph. In order to achieve this, we find the optimal
partitioning of the graph nodes such that the cost of anonymizing the degree
information within each group is minimum. We show that this reduces to a
special case of a Generalized Assignment Problem, and we propose a simple yet
effective algorithm to solve it. Finally, we introduce an iterated linear
programming approach to enforce the realizability of the anonymized degree
sequences. The efficacy of the method is assessed through an extensive set of
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs.

actively sharing their location through a variety of applications and services.
Along with the continuing growth of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs),
security experts have increasingly warned the public of the dangers of exposing
sensitive information such as personal location data. Most importantly, in
addition to the geographical coordinates of the user's location, LBSNs allow
easy access to an additional set of characteristics of that location, such as
the venue type or popularity.
  In this paper, we investigate the role of location semantics in the
identification of LBSN users. We simulate a scenario in which the attacker's
goal is to reveal the identity of a set of LBSN users by observing their
check-in activity. We then propose to answer the following question: what are
the types of venues that a malicious user has to monitor to maximize the
probability of success? Conversely, when should a user decide whether to make
his/her check-in to a location public or not? We perform our study on more than
1 million check-ins distributed over 17 urban regions of the United States. Our
analysis shows that different types of venues display different discriminative
power in terms of user identity, with most of the venues in the ""Residence""
category providing the highest re-identification success across the urban
regions. Interestingly, we also find that users with a high entropy of their
check-ins distribution are not necessarily the hardest to identify, suggesting
that it is the collective behaviour of the users' population that determines
the complexity of the identification task, rather than the individual
behaviour.

atmospheric model to Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) high spectral
resolution observations and determine the D/H ratio in methane absorption in
the infrared H-band ($\sim$ 1.6 {\mu}m). The model was derived using our
radiative transfer software VSTAR (Versatile Software for the Transfer of
Atmospheric Radiation) and atmospheric fitting software ATMOF (ATMOspheric

the last few years, enabling a refinement of earlier estimates. We identify a
bright region on the planetary disc and find it to correspond to an optically
thick lower cloud. Our preliminary determination of CH$_{\rm 3}$D/CH$_{\rm 4}$

evidence that the proto-solar ice D/H ratio of Neptune is much less than that

equivariant Morse function, i.e, there are only finitely many critical orbits

function of being an equivariant Morse function has been used, and in fact
indispensable, in several occasions. But it is actually still an open question

fast, active control mechanisms to counter aerodynamic instability. To directly
investigate how freely-flying D. melanogaster control their body pitch angle
against such instability, we perturb them using impulsive mechanical torques
and film their corrective maneuvers with high-speed video. Combining
experimental observations and numerical simulation, we find that flies correct
for pitch deflections of up to 40 degrees in 29 +/- 8 ms by bilaterally
modulating their wings' front-most stroke angle in a manner well-described by a
linear proportional-integral (PI) controller. Flies initiate this corrective
process after only 10 +/- 2 ms, indicating that pitch stabilization involves a
fast reflex response. Remarkably, flies can also correct for very
large-amplitude pitch perturbations--greater than 150 degrees--providing a
regime in which to probe the limits of the linear-response framework. Together
with previous studies regarding yaw and roll control, our results on pitch show
that flies' stabilization of each of these body angles is consistent with PI
control.

investigated. We show that in the regime of a high strength of disordering
compared to the interaction an off-resonant flip-flop spin-spin interaction
(hopping) generates the effective Ising interactions of spins in the third
order of perturbation theory in a hopping. The combination of hopping and
induced Ising interactions for the power law distance dependent hopping $V(R)
\propto R^{-\alpha}$ always leads to the localization breakdown in a
thermodynamic limit of an infinite system at $\alpha < 3d/2$ where $d$ is a
system dimension. The delocalization takes place due to the induced Ising
interactions $U(R) \propto R^{-2\alpha}$ of ""extended"" resonant pairs. This
prediction is consistent with the numerical finite size scaling in
one-dimensional systems. Many-body localization in $XY$ model is more stable
with respect to the long-range interaction compared to a many-body problem with
similar Ising and Heisenberg interactions requiring $\alpha \geq 2d$ which
makes the practical implementations of this model more attractive for quantum
information applications. The full summary of dimension constraints and
localization threshold size dependencies for many-body localization in the case
of combined Ising and hopping interactions is obtained using this and previous

duration for which it is active, and together these fractions influence the
interference seen in the network. To address this joint optimization problem we
adopt an approach wherein the activation fractions and the user associations
are optimized in an alternating manner. The sub-problem of determining the
optimal activation fractions is solved using an auxiliary function method that
we show is provably convergent and is amenable to distributed implementation.
On the other hand, the sub-problem of determining the user association is
solved via a simple combinatorial algorithm. Meaningful performance guarantees
are derived and a distributed variant offering identical guarantees is also
proposed. The significant benefits of using the proposed algorithms are then
demonstrated via realistic simulations.

motivated by reasoning of the form ""we will do X"" (shared intentions), as
opposed to reasoning of the form ""I will do X [because he is doing X]""
(individual intentions). The mechanism behind the evolution of shared
intentionality is unknown. Here we formally model the evolution of jointly
intentional action and show under what conditions it is likely to have emerged
in humans. Modelling the interaction of hunter-gatherers as a coordination
game, we find that when the benefits from adopting new technologies or norms
are low but positive, the sharing of intentions does not evolve, despite being
a mutualistic behaviour that directly benefits all participants. When the
benefits from adopting new technologies or norms are high, such as may be the
case during a period of rapid environmental change, shared intentionality
evolves and rapidly becomes dominant in the population. Our results shed new
light on the evolution of collaborative behaviours.

galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185. The resulting F606W and F814W color-magnitude
diagrams are the first to reach below the main sequence turnoff in a dE galaxy,
allowing us to determine full star formation histories in these systems. The
ACS fields are located ~1.5 effective radii from the galaxy center to avoid
photometric crowding. While our ACS pointings in both dEs show unambiguous
evidence for old and intermediate age stars, the mean age in NGC 147 is ~ 4 Gyr
younger as compared to NGC 185. In NGC 147, only 40% of stars were in place
12.5 Gyrs ago (z~5), with the bulk of the remaining stellar population forming
between 5 to 7 Gyr. In contrast, 70% of stars were formed in NGC 185 field more
than12.5 Gyr ago with the majority of the remaining population forming between
8 to 10 Gyr. Star formation ceased in both ACS fields at least 3 Gyr ago.
Previous observations in the central regions of NGC 185 show evidence for star
formation as recent as 100 Myr ago and a strong metallicity gradient with
radius. We suggest that the orbit of NGC 185 has a larger pericenter as
compared to NGC 147, allowing it to preserve radial gradients and maintain a
small central reservoir of recycled gas. We interpret the inferred differences
in star formation histories to imply an earlier infall time into the M31
environment for NGC 185 as compared to NGC 147.

maximum force (stall force) generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or
molecular motors may not always be just a simple sum of the stall forces of the
individual filaments or motors. To understand this excess or deficit in the
collective force, we study a broad class of models of both cytoskeletal
filaments and molecular motors. We argue that the stall force generated by a
group of filaments or motors is additive, that is, the stall force of $N$
number of filaments (motors) is $N$ times the stall force of one filament
(motor), when the system is in equilibrium at stall. Conversely, we show that
this additive property typically does not hold true when the system is not at
equilibrium at stall. We thus present a novel and unified understanding of the
existing models exhibiting such non-addivity, and generalise our arguments by
developing new models that demonstrate this phenomena. We also propose a
quantity similar to thermodynamic efficiency to easily predict this deviation
from stall-force additivity for filament and motor collectives.

simple version of Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) theories, which is
the minimum extension of Horndeski theories, we show that a slight deviation of
the tensor propagation speed squared $c_{\rm t}^2$ from 1 generally leads to
the large modification to the propagation speed squared $c_{\rm s}^2$ of a
scalar degree of freedom $\phi$. This problem persists whenever the kinetic
energy $\rho_X$ of the field $\phi$ is much smaller than the background energy
density $\rho_m$, which is the case for most of dark energy models in the
asymptotic past. Since the scaling solution characterized by the constant ratio
$\rho_X/\rho_m$ is one way out for avoiding such a problem, we study the
evolution of perturbations for a scaling dark energy model in the framework of
GLPV theories in the Jordan frame. Provided the oscillating mode of scalar
perturbations is fine-tuned so that it is initially suppressed, the anisotropic
parameter $\eta=-\Phi/\Psi$ between the two gravitational potentials $\Psi$ and
$\Phi$ significantly deviates from 1 for $c_{\rm t}^2$ away from 1. For other
general initial conditions, the deviation of $c_{\rm t}^2$ from 1 gives rise to
the large oscillation of $\Psi$ with the frequency related to $c_{\rm s}^2$. In
both cases, the model can leave distinct imprints for the observations of CMB

containing equal amounts of particles with different masses. Ordering of the
particles in the chain is governed by single correlation parameter -- the
probability for two neighboring particles to have the same mass. As this
parameter grows from zero to unity, the structure of the chain varies from
regular staggering chain to completely random configuration, and then -- to
very long clusters of particles with equal masses. Therefore, this correlation
parameter allows a control of typical cluster size in the chain. In order to
explore different regimes of the heat transport, two interatomic potentials are
considered. The first one is an infinite potential wall, corresponding to
instantaneous elastic collisions between the neighboring particles. In
homogeneous chains such interaction leads to an anomalous heat transport. The
other one is classical Lennard-Jones interatomic potential, which leads to a
normal heat transport. The simulations demonstrate that the correlated disorder
of the particle arrangement does not change the convergence properties of the
heat conduction coefficient, but essentially modifies its value. For the
collision potential, one observes essential growth of the coefficient for fixed
chain length as the limit of large homogeneous clusters is approached. The
thermal transport in these models remains superdiffusive. In the Lennard-Jones
chain the effect of correlation appears to be not monotonous in the limit of
low temperatures. This behavior stems from the competition between formation of
long clusters mentioned above, and Anderson localization close to the
staggering ordered state.

the hexagonal In/Si(111)-($\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$) surface, which has been
considered to represent an ultimate two-dimensional (2D) limit of metallic In
overlayers. Contrary to the prevailing assumption, this surface consists of not
a single layer but a double layer of In atoms, which corresponds to a hexagonal
deformation of the well-established $rectangular$ In double layer formed on
Si(111)-($\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$) [Park $et$ $al$., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,
166102 (2012)]. The same double-layer thickness accounts well for the typical
coexistence of the hexagonal and rectangular phases and their similar 2D
electronic structures. It is thus conclusive that, regardless of rectangular or
hexagonal, the In/Si(111)-($\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$) surface does not represent
an one-atom-thick In overlayer.

environment is described by quantum Bose fields in a suitable non-Fock
representation which allows for the introduction of temperature. A generic
spectral density of the environment can be described by introducing its state
trough a suitable P-representation. Including interaction of the mechanical
oscillator with a cavity mode via radiation pressure we obtain a description of
a simple optomechanical system in which, besides the Langevin equations for the

whole theory is valid at arbitrarily low temperature. This allows the exact
calculation of the stationary value of the mean energy of the mechanical
oscillator, as well as both homodyne and heterodyne spectra. The present
analysis allows in particular to study possible cooling scenarios and to obtain
the exact connection between observed spectra and fluctuation spectra of the

homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. We deal with regular coverings in which this
homomorphism is prescribed by an action of a semiregular subgroup $\Gamma$ of
$\textrm{Aut}(G)$; so $H \cong G / \Gamma$. In this paper, we study the
behaviour of regular graph covering with respect to 1-cuts and 2-cuts in $G$.
  We describe reductions which produce a series of graphs $G = G_0,\dots,G_r$
such that $G_{i+1}$ is created from $G_i$ by replacing certain inclusion
minimal subgraphs with colored edges. The process ends with a primitive graph
$G_r$ which is either 3-connected, or a cycle, or $K_2$. This reduction can be
viewed as a non-trivial modification of reductions of Mac Lane (1937),
Trachtenbrot (1958), Tutte (1966), Hopcroft and Tarjan (1973), Cuningham and
Edmonds (1980), Walsh (1982), and others. A novel feature of our approach is
that in each step all essential information about symmetries of $G$ are
preserved.
  A regular covering projection $G_0\to H_0$ induces regular covering
projections $G_i \to H_i$ where $H_i$ is the $i$-th quotient reduction of
$H_0$. This property allows to construct all possible quotients $H_0$ of $G_0$
from the possible quotients $H_r$ of $G_r$. By applying this method to planar
graphs, we give a proof of Negami's Theorem (1988). Our structural results are
also used in subsequent papers for regular covering testing when $G$ is a
planar graph and for an inductive characterization of the automorphism groups
of planar graphs (see Babai (1973) as well).

infeasible. Despite being immensely popular, current theoretical understanding
of the effectiveness of variaitonal inference based algorithms is very limited.
In this work we provide the first analysis of instances where variational
inference algorithms converge to the global optimum, in the setting of topic
models.
  More specifically, we show that variational inference provably learns the
optimal parameters of a topic model under natural assumptions on the topic-word
matrix and the topic priors. The properties that the topic word matrix must
satisfy in our setting are related to the topic expansion assumption introduced
in (Anandkumar et al., 2013), as well as the anchor words assumption in (Arora
et al., 2012c). The assumptions on the topic priors are related to the well
known Dirichlet prior, introduced to the area of topic modeling by (Blei et
al., 2003).
  It is well known that initialization plays a crucial role in how well
variational based algorithms perform in practice. The initializations that we
use are fairly natural. One of them is similar to what is currently used in
LDA-c, the most popular implementation of variational inference for topic
models. The other one is an overlapping clustering algorithm, inspired by a
work by (Arora et al., 2014) on dictionary learning, which is very simple and
efficient.
  While our primary goal is to provide insights into when variational inference
might work in practice, the multiplicative, rather than the additive nature of
the variational inference updates forces us to use fairly non-standard proof
arguments, which we believe will be of general interest.

interest. To perform dynamic spectrum access, different paradigms are
conceptualized in the literature. Of these, Underlay System (US) has caught
much attention in the recent past. According to US, a power control mechanism
is employed at the Secondary Transmitter (ST) to constrain the interference at
the Primary Receiver (PR) below a certain threshold. However, it requires the
knowledge of channel towards PR at the ST. This knowledge can be obtained by
estimating the received power, assuming a beacon or a pilot channel
transmission by the PR. This estimation is never perfect, hence the induced
error may distort the true performance of the US. Motivated by this fact, we
propose a novel model that captures the effect of channel estimation errors on
the performance of the system. More specifically, we characterize the
performance of the US in terms of the estimation-throughput tradeoff.
Furthermore, we determine the maximum achievable throughput for the secondary
link. Based on numerical analysis, it is shown that the conventional model
overestimates the performance of the US.

allowing an accurate determination of the thickness up to tens of atomic
layers, which is considerably higher than those previously achieved by using
high-frequency Raman modes. These results offer fundamental insights and

of how complex transport networks emerge from simple auto-catalytic and self-

exhibit computationally desirable measures of transport efficiency in terms of
overall path length, minimal connectivity and network resilience. Although
significant progress has been made in mathematically modelling the behaviour of
Physarum networks (and other biological transport networks) based on observed
features in experimental settings, their initial emergence - and in particular
their long-term persistence and evolution - is still poorly understood. We
present a low-level, bottom-up, approach to the modelling of emergent transport
networks. A population of simple particle-like agents coupled with paracrine
chemotaxis behaviours in a dissipative environment results in the spontaneous
emergence of persistent, complex structures. Second order emergent behaviours,
in the form of network surface minimisation, are also observed contributing to
the long term evolution and dynamics of the networks. The framework is extended
to allow data presentation and the population is used to perform a direct

employed, loosely relating to behaviours of Physarum under different

molecular clouds that gives rise to strong molecular emission in the far-IR and
sub-mm wavelength regimes can be used as a highly valuable tracer of these
conditions. The application of MHD shock models in the interpretation of the
resulting line emission can yield information on the energetic and chemical
impact of supernova remnants. We have mapped two regions in the supernova
remnant W44 with the APEX telescope in ${}^{12}$CO (3-2), (4-3), (6-5), (7-6)
and ${}^{13}$CO (3-2). The extraction of integrated intensities on five
different positions, corresponding to local maxima of CO emission, allows to
compare these intensities to the outputs of a grid of models, which combine an
MHD shock code with a radiative transfer module based on the 'large velocity
gradient' approximation. We find that the observed CO line emission is
compatible with non-stationary shocks and a pre-shock density of $10^4$
cm${}^{-3}$. Our models furthermore allow to constrain shock ages, velocities,
the pre-shock magnetic field strength components perpendicular to the
line-of-sight, and the full ladder of CO transitions. Finally, our analysis can

communication based on periodic message exchange. We start by analyzing
measurements collected on four test sites across Europe. To measure cooperative
awareness, we use three metrics: 1) neighborhood awareness ratio; 2) ratio of
neighbors above range; and 3) packet delivery rate. Using the collected data,
we define a simple model for calculating neighborhood awareness given packet
delivery ratio for a given environment. Finally, we perform realistic,
large-scale simulations to explore the achievable performance of cooperative
awareness under realistic transmit power and transmit rate constraints. Our
measurements and simulation results show that: i) above a certain threshold,
there is little benefit in increasing cooperative message rate to improve the
awareness; higher transmit power and fewer messages transmissions are a better
approach, since message delivery is dominated by shadowing. ii) the efficacy of
cooperative awareness varies greatly in different environments on both large
scale (e.g., 90\% awareness is achievable up to 200~m in urban and over 500~m
in highway) and small scale (e.g., vehicles in nearby streets can have
significantly different awareness); iii) V2V and V2I communication have
distinct awareness patterns; iv) each location has a distinct transmit power
that achieves high awareness; and v) achieving high awareness levels results in
increased reception of potentially unwanted messages; therefore, a balance
needs to be found between awareness and interference, depending on the specific
context. We hope our results will serve as a starting point for designing more
effective periodic message exchange services for cooperative awareness.

differentiate between subsequent stages of high-mass star formation regions due
to the strong temperature dependence of deuterium isotopic fractionation. We
observed a sample of 59 sources including 19 infrared dark clouds, 20 high-mass
protostellar objects, 11 hot molecular cores and 9 ultra-compact HII regions in
the (3-2) transitions of the four deuterated molecules, DCN, DNC, DCO+ and N2D+

DCN, DNC and DCO+ is high and exceeds 50% for most of the stages. N2D+ was only
detected in a few infrared dark clouds and high-mass protostellar objects. It
can be related to problems in the bandpass at the frequency of the transition
and to low abundances in the more evolved, warmer stages. We find median D/H
ratios of ~0.02 for DCN, ~0.005 for DNC, ~0.0025 for DCO+ and ~0.02 for N2D+.
While the D/H ratios of DNC, DCO+ and N2D+ decrease with time, DCN/HCN peaks at
the hot molecular core stage. We only found weak correlations of the D/H ratios
for N2D+ with the luminosity of the central source and the FWHM of the line,
and no correlation with the H2 column density. In combination with a previously
observed set of 14 other molecules (Paper I) we fitted the calculated column
densities with an elaborate 1D physico-chemical model with time-dependent
D-chemistry including ortho- and para-H2 states. Good overall fits to the

are to a large extent determined by the hydration and oxidation of oxygen
vacancies, which introduce protons and holes, respectively. First-principles
modeling of these reactions involves calculation of formation energies of
charged defects, which requires an accurate description of the band gap and the
position of the band edges. Since density-functional theory (DFT) with local
and semi-local exchange-correlation functionals (LDA and GGA) systematically
fails to predict these quantities this can have serious implications on the
modeling of defect reactions. In this study we investigate how the description
of band gap and band edge positions affects the hydration and oxidation in
acceptor-doped BaZrO$_3$. First-principles calculations are performed in
combination with thermodynamic modeling in order to obtain equilibrium charge
carrier concentrations at different temperatures and partial pressures. Three
different methods have been considered: DFT with both semi-local (PBE) and
hybrid (PBE0) exchange-correlation functionals, and many-body perturbation
theory within the $G_0W_0$-approximation. All three methods yield similar
results for the hydration reaction, which are consistent with experimental
findings. For the oxidation reaction, on the other hand, there is a qualitative
difference. PBE predicts the reaction to be exothermic while the two others
predict an endothermic behavior. Results from thermodynamic modeling are
compared with available experimental data, such as enthalpies, concentrations
and conductivities, and only the results obtained with PBE0 and $G_0W_0$, with
an endothermic oxidation behavior, give a satisfactory agreement with
experiments.

To cover all the phase information conveyed by different factors, we introduce
the equivalent transmit phase centers. The newly defined AF serves as a
generalized AF form for which the phased-array (PA) and traditional MIMO radar
AFs are important special cases. We establish relationships among the defined
TB-based MIMO radar AF and the existing AF results including the Woodward's AF,
the AFs defined for the traditional colocated MIMO radar, and also the PA radar
AF, respectively. Moreover, we compare the TB-based MIMO radar AF with the
square-summation-form AF definition and identify two limiting cases to bound
its 'clear region' in Doppler-delay domain that is free of sidelobes.
Corresponding bounds for these two cases are derived, and it is shown that the
bound for the worst case is inversely proportional to the number of transmitted
waveforms K, whereas the bound for the best case is independent of K. The
actual 'clear region' of the TB-based MIMO radar AF depends on the array
configuration and is in between of the worst- and best-case bounds. We propose
a TB design strategy to reduce the levels of the AF sidelobes, and show in
simulations that proper design of the TB matrix leads to reduction of the
relative sidelobe levels of the TB-based MIMO radar AF.

the ionization state and kinematics of the ISM of ESO338-IG04. The velocity map
reveals two outflows. The entire central area of the galaxy is highly ionized

Three highly ionized cones have been identified, of which one is associated

mechanical feedback of the older clusters, while the highly ionized gas is
caused by the hard ionizing photons emitted by the youngest clusters. A
comparison with the Ly$\alpha$ map shows that the (approximately bipolar)
asymmetries observed in the Ly$\alpha$ emission are consistent with the base of
the outflows detected in H$\alpha$. No clear correlation with the ionization

The instrument RAD, onboard Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) rover Curiosity,
measures a broad spectrum of energetic particles along with the radiation dose
rate during the 253-day cruise phase as well as on the surface of Mars. With
these first ever measurements inside a spacecraft from Earth to Mars, RAD
observed the impulsive enhancement of dose rate during solar particle events as
well as a gradual evolution of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) induced radiation
dose rate due to the modulation of the primary GCR flux by the solar magnetic
field, which correlates with long-term solar activities and heliospheric
rotation. Results: We analyzed the dependence of the dose rate measured by RAD
on solar modulation potentials and estimated the dose rate and dose equivalent
under different solar modulation conditions. These estimations help us to have
approximate predictions of the cruise radiation environment, such as the
accumulated dose equivalent associated with future human missions to Mars.
Conclusions: The predicted dose equivalent rate during solar maximum conditions
could be as low as one-fourth of the current RAD cruise measurement. However,
future measurements during solar maximum and minimum periods are essential to
validate our estimations.

interpretations of hadronic resonances, which might be of particular relevance
to understand the nature of the so-called $XYZ$ particles. Recent studies have
shown that in addition to the well-established naive quark model picture, the
axial-vector meson $f_1(1285)$ can also be understood as a dynamically
generated state built upon the $KK^*$ interaction. In this work, we calculate
the energy levels of the $KK^*$ system in the $f_1(1285)$ channel in finite
volume using the chiral unitary approach. We propose to calculate the loop
function in the dimensional regularization scheme, which is equivalent to the
hybrid approach adopted in previous studies. We also study the inverse problem
of extracting the bound state information from synthetic lattice QCD data and
comment on the difference between our approach and the L{\"" u}scher method.

numbers for which a fixed integer $g$ is a primitive root, provided $g \neq -1$
and $g$ is not a perfect square. Thanks to work of Hooley, we know that this
conjecture is true, conditional on the truth of the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis. Using a combination of Hooley's analysis and the techniques of
Maynard-Tao used to prove the existence of bounded gaps between primes, Pollack
has shown that (conditional on GRH) there are bounded gaps between primes with
a prescribed primitive root. In the present article, we provide an
unconditional proof of the analogue of Pollack's work in the function field
case; namely, that given a monic polynomial $g(t)$ which is not an $v$th power
for any prime $v$ dividing $q-1$, there are bounded gaps between monic
irreducible polynomials $P(t)$ in $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ for which $g(t)$ is a
primitive root (which is to say that $g(t)$ generates the group of units modulo
$P(t)$). In particular, we obtain bounded gaps between primitive polynomials,
corresponding to the choice $g(t) = t$.

their link with the Lyman-Break galaxy population (LBG), using a semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation that takes into account resonant scattering of Lya
photons in gas outflows. We can reasonably reproduce the abundances of LAEs and
LBGs from redshift 3 to 7, as well as most UV LFs of LAEs. The stronger dust
attenuation for (resonant) Lya photons compared to UV continuum photons in
bright LBGs provides a natural interpretation to the increase of the LAE
fraction in LBG samples, X_LAE, towards fainter magnitudes. The redshift
evolution of X_LAE seems however very sensitive to UV magnitudes limits and EW
cuts. In spite of the apparent good match between the statistical properties
predicted by the model and the observations, we find that the tail of the Lya
equivalent width distribution (EW > 100 A) cannot be explained by our model,
and we need to invoke additional mechanisms. We find that LAEs and LBGs span a
very similar dynamical range, but bright LAEs are about 4 times rarer than LBGs
in massive halos. Moreover, massive halos mainly contain weak LAEs in our
model, which might introduce a bias towards low-mass halos in surveys which
select sources with high EW cuts. Overall, our results are consistent with the
idea that LAEs and LBGs make a very similar galaxy population. Their apparent
differences seem mainly due to EW selections, UV detection limits, and a
decreasing Lya-to-UV escape fraction ratio in high SFR galaxies.

The FPS equation of state was used to describe the neutron star structure while

sensitive to the oblateness of the rotating star. For models of rotating
neutron stars of moderate mass, as well as for strange quark star models, the

at a certain stellar rotation rate. These findings may have implications for

permutation-diffusion structure for designing digital image cryptosystem has
been receiving increasing research attention in the field of chaos-based
cryptography. Recently, a novel chaotic Image Cipher using one round Modified
Permutation-Diffusion pattern (ICMPD) was proposed. Unlike traditional
permutation-diffusion structure, the permutation is operated on bit level
instead of pixel level and the diffusion is operated on masked pixels, which
are obtained by carrying out the classical affine cipher, instead of plain
pixels in ICMPD. Following a \textit{divide-and-conquer strategy}, this paper
reports that ICMPD can be compromised by a chosen-plaintext attack efficiently
and the involved data complexity is linear to the size of the plain-image.
Moreover, the relationship between the cryptographic kernel at the diffusion
stage of ICMPD and modulo addition then XORing is explored thoroughly.

achieve satisfactory performance at a significantly smaller computational cost
for various tasks. People have also combined superpixels with Markov random
field (MRF) models. However, it often takes additional effort to formulate MRF
on superpixel-level, and to the best of our knowledge there exists no
principled approach to obtain this formulation. In this paper, we show how
generic pixel-level binary MRF model can be solved in the superpixel space. As
the main contribution of this paper, we show that a superpixel-level MRF can be
derived from the pixel-level MRF by substituting the superpixel representation
of the pixelwise label into the original pixel-level MRF energy. The resultant
superpixel-level MRF energy also remains submodular for a submodular
pixel-level MRF. The derived formula hence gives us a handy way to formulate
MRF energy in superpixel-level. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach on several computer vision problems.

investigated the properties of 80% of the catalogued clusters in this part of

a homogeneous scale for all. Their spatial distribution suggests that the
oldest clusters, log(t yr-1) >= 9.6, are in general located at greater
distances to the galaxy's centre than their younger counterparts -- 9.0 <=
log(t yr-1) <= 9.4 -- while two excesses of clusters are seen at log(t yr-1) ~
9.2 and log(t yr-1) ~ 9.7. We found a trail of younger clusters which follow
the Wing/Bridge components. This long spatial sequence does not only harbour
very young clusters, log(t yr-1) ~ 7.3, but it also hosts some of intermediate
ages, log(t yr-1) ~ 9.1. The derived cluster and field-star formation
frequencies as a function of age are different. The most surprising feature is
an observed excess of clusters with ages of log(t yr-1) < 9.0, which could have
been induced by interactions with the LMC.

search for signatures of dark matter, investigation of gamma-ray point and

diffuse emission, studies of gamma-ray bursts and gamma-ray emission from the
active Sun, as well as high-precision measurements of spectra of high-energy

species from certain parts of space. On the population level, it is the
segregation of space into separate areas, each used by subsections of the
population. Proving mathematically that such individual-level processes can
cause observed population-level patterns to form is necessary for linking these
two levels of description in a non-speculative way. Previous mathematical
analysis has relied upon assuming animals are attracted to a central area. This
can either be a fixed geographical point, such as a den- or nest-site, or a
region where they have previously visited. However, recent simulation-based
studies suggest that this attractive potential is not necessary for territorial
pattern formation. Here, we construct a partial differential equation (PDE)
model of territorial interactions based on the individual-based model (IBM)
from those simulation studies. The resulting PDE does not rely on attraction to
spatial locations, but purely on conspecific avoidance, mediated via
scent-marking. We show analytically that steady-state patterns can form, as
long as (i) the scent does not decay faster than it takes the animal to
traverse the terrain, and (ii) the spatial scale over which animals detect
scent is incorporated into the PDE. As part of the analysis, we develop a
general method for taking the PDE limit of an IBM that avoids destroying any
intrinsic spatial scale in the underlying behavioral decisions.

low-mass main-sequence stars between masses of 0.4 and 1.1 solar masses at a
range of distances from the star.
  Methods: We use 1D thermal pressure driven hydrodynamic wind models run using
the Versatile Advection Code. Using in situ measurements of the solar wind, we
produce models for the slow and fast components of the solar wind. We consider
two radically different methods for scaling the base temperature of the wind to
other stars: in Model A, we assume that wind temperatures are fundamentally
linked to coronal temperatures, and in Model B, we assume that the sound speed
at the base of the wind is a fixed fraction of the escape velocity. In Paper II
of this series, we use observationally constrained rotational evolution models
to derive wind mass loss rates.
  Results: Our model for the solar wind provides an excellent description of
the real solar wind far from the solar surface, but is unrealistic within the
solar corona. We run a grid of 1200 wind models to derive relations for the
wind properties as a function of stellar mass, radius, and wind temperature.
Using these results, we explore how wind properties depend on stellar mass and
rotation.
  Conclusions: Based on our two assumptions about the scaling of the wind
temperature, we argue that there is still significant uncertainty in how these
properties should be determined. Resolution of this uncertainty will probably
require both the application of solar wind physics to other stars and detailed
observational constraints on the properties of stellar winds. In the final
section of this paper, we give step by step instructions for how to apply our
results to calculate the stellar wind conditions far from the stellar surface.

special cases were they have to be identical and there are large regions in the

practically identical for $\pi_0$ production in the energy range of the

the Vainshtein mechanism depends on the cosmic web morphology of dark matter
particles, since these are defined according to the dimensionality of their
collapse, while the chameleon mechanism shows no morphology dependence. The
chameleon screening of halos and their velocity dispersions depend on halo
mass, and small halos and subhalos can be environmentally screened in the
chameleon mechanism. On the other hand, the screening of halos in the
Vainshtein mechanism does not depend on mass nor environment, and their
velocity dispersions are suppressed. The peculiar velocities of halos in the
Vainshtein mechanism are enhanced because screened objects can still feel the
fifth force generated by external fields, while peculiar velocities of
chameleon halos are suppressed when the halo centers are screened.

that the convergence to a local minimiser is guaranteed using an alternating

such as the dissemination of ideas, beliefs or behaviors, social learning and
the diffusion of innovations. Different mechanisms have been proposed to
implement inter-agent influence in social models from the voter model, to
majority rules, to the Granoveter model. Here we advance in this direction by
confronting the recently introduced Social Influence and Recurrent Mobility
(SIRM) model, that reproduces generic features of vote-shares at different
geographical levels, with data in the US presidential elections. Our approach
incorporates spatial and population diversity as inputs for the opinion
dynamics while individuals' mobility provides a proxy for social context, and
peer imitation accounts for social influence. The model captures the observed
stationary background fluctuations in the vote-shares across counties. We study
the so-called political strongholds, i.e., locations where the votes-shares for
a party are systematically higher than average. A quantitative definition of a
stronghold by means of persistence in time of fluctuations in the voting
spatial distribution is introduced, and results from the US Presidential
Elections during the period 1980-2012 are analyzed within this framework. We
compare electoral results with simulations obtained with the SIRM model finding
a good agreement both in terms of the number and the location of strongholds.
The strongholds duration is also systematically characterized in the SIRM

of a common pool of microRNAs, a class of small non-coding downregulators of
gene expression. Behaving as microRNA-sponges, distinct RNA species may compete
for binding to microRNAs and coregulate each other in a dose-dependent manner.
Although previous studies in cell populations showed competition in vitro, the
detailed dynamical aspects of this process, most importantly in physiological
conditions, remains unclear. We address this point by monitoring protein
expression of two targets of a common miRNA with quantitative single-cell
measurements. In agreement with a detailed stochastic model of molecular
titration, we observed that: (i) crosstalk between targets is possible only in
particular stoichiometric conditions, (ii) a trade-off on the number of
microRNA regulatory elements may induce the coexistence of two distinct cell
populations, (iii) strong inter-targets correlations can be observed. This
phenomenology is compatible with a small amount of mRNA target molecules per
cell of the order of 10-100.

vector field diagrams are a central tool to show a system's qualitative

involved issues of vector normalization, these plots give only a coarse insight
and are unable to convey the vector field behaviour at locations with high
variation, in particular in the neighborhood of critical points. Similarly,
automatic generation of phase portraits based on traditional sampling cannot
precisely capture separatrices or limit cylces. In this paper, we present
ASysViewer, an application for the interactive visual exploration of

techniques for visualization, and grid-based techniques to extract critical

onto a multi-dimensional Euclidean space and it was used by scientists to study
the multi-relational complexity of ecology. However the research went out of

account the influence of conviction during the formation of opinion in a system

which is based on the human tendency to compromise and change of opinion
through self-thinking, is here modified in the parameters of the compromise and
diffusion terms, which now are assumed to depend on the personal degree of
conviction. The numerical simulations show that the presence of conviction has
the potential to break symmetry, and to produce clusters of opinions. The model
is partially inspired by the recent work [L. Pareschi, G. Toscani, Phil. Trans.
